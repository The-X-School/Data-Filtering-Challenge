{"text":"Flip Your Wig: Hostage Calm \"Hostage Calm\"\n\nIt's hard to explain why you're a pop-punk fan if you are over the age of 20. Most people have a crystalline memory of Blink-182 running around naked and stop their curiosity there. The genre has as much potential to carry social change, introspection, and power as any other genre, but it's often lost in a quagmire of angst, questionable fashion, and chunky power chords. Luckily, there has been a resurgence of talented and articulate bands who have been building steady followings.\n\nConnecticut's Hostage Calm have spent ample time studying the Kid Dynamite and Gatsby's American Dream's playbooks, merging everything from breakneck hardcore, salsa numbers, three part vocal harmonies, and intricate time structures into a refreshing breath of exuberant music. Bored of the confines of hardcore music, but not it's messages, Hostage Calm delivered a perplexing 180 on their sonic approach to last year's self-titled effort. The energy remained, but, much like when Saves The Day broke through with \"Stay Where You Are\" and No Doubt went pop with \"Tragic Kingdom\", the whole approach changed. I'm happy to report that they are still as socially aware and relatable as ever.\n\nSongs like \"Ballots\/Stones\" challenge the rationale of anti-gay-marriage politics with simple, infectious melodies while \"Rebel Fatigues\" takes a look at American foreign policies from the other perspective. Hardcore lifers need not fret; the blistering guitar work and breakdowns still pop up, just differently than before. Just because more is sung than yelled is no reason to jettison this to the used bin. Chris' singing is actually more endearing because it isn't studio or American Idol's perception of \"perfect\".\n\nConecticut's New Favorite Sons\n\nAlong with other bands like The Wonder Years, Set Your Goals, Transit, and Fireworks, Hostage Calm builds bridges between very different schools of thought and winning over crowds wherever they go. Personal biases for the genre aside (it rules), it's comforting to be reminded how something so simple can incorporate and mean so many different things at any given time. It's more refreshing, given the band's recent partnership with Alternative Press to urge New York senators to legalize gay marriage in their state, that the band puts their words into action like true activists and allies. If you'd like to have a half hour with a quirky, honest, and intelligent young men, you might want to consider following Hostage Calm, as they're nearly destined for greatness.\n\nRecommended If You Like:\nGatsby's American Dream's \"Gatsby's American Dream\"\nThe Wonder Years \"Suburbia, I've Given You All and Now I'm Nothing\"\nCrime in Stereo's \"The Troubled Stateside\""}
{"text":"UAB hosts an Exhilarating Ride among other fun events!\n\nNew Scholarship promoting Leadership honors President Hammond\n\nOnline courses at FHSU place nationwide!\n\nBrett Dennen CD explores styles\n\nI first fell in love with Brett Dennen when I heard \"Ain't No Reason\" from one of his older albums. Then I saw his long ginger hair, blue eyes and black-rimmed nerd glasses and was hooked.\n\nDennen's new album, \"Loverboy,\" was released April 12, and it's no disappointment. Dennen experiments with genres such as pop, reggae, blues and folk, making the album diverse. Even with so many genres, \"Loverboy\" isn't disconnected. Dennen's unique voice and soul connects everything together very well.\n\nWith a title like \"Loverboy,\" the listener has to know that the album will more than likely be a lot about love, and it is. I'm not complaining. Most of the time it's hidden a little better within the clever lyrics than other typical love songs. I'm only curious as to why Dennen decided to make an album so centered on love.\n\n\"Loverboy\" opens up with the track \"Surprise, Surprise.\" And surprise, surprise, it's as excellent as I expected. Dennen sings, \"Open up your eyes; it's happening all around you,\" about being open to new experiences. \"If it hasn't found you, you know it's just a matter of time.\"\n\nMoving on down the track list, the fifth song, \"Sydney (I'll Come Running),\" is a definite highlight of \"Loverboy.\" It's relatable and peppy. Dennen's vocal variety is not only pleasing to listen to, but I could really feel his passion as well. After listening to the song a couple times, I found myself singing the chorus in the shower, walking to class, driving in my car, etc. \"Straight from the airport (I'll come runnin'), cut through the customs line (I'll come runnin'), bust down the courthouse doors (I'll come runnin'). Sydney, I will testify.\"\n\nStepping up to the genre plate is \"Make You Fall In Love with Me\" with a ska twist. It has every element to make up a ska song\u2014piano, bass line, maracas and, of course, trumpet. For the ska musical element alone, \"Make You Fall In Love with Me\" is another highlight of the album. Plus, it's just a song that fits on an album entitled \"Loverboy.\"\n\n\"Only Rain\" features an organ, which is an interesting element in the song. It also gives the song a sadder feel to it, which is totally appropriate. Dennen's songs include a lot of unique instruments that you don't hear much in the mainstream music scene. It's fascinating to listen to his music and pick out all of the different instruments.\n\nDennen covers so many human feelings in \"Loverboy\" besides just love. He covers things like the experience of losing someone to things like thinking of someone all of the time. Because he makes his lyrics so relatable and his music so diverse and interesting to hear, not to mention his voice is perfect to sing along with, Brett Dennen is a definite success, and so is \"Loverboy.\""}

{"text":"Calamity Drenching\n\n(Team Love; US: 23 Sep 2008; UK: Available as import)\n\nMcCarthy Trenching: Calamity Drenching\n\nMcCarthy Trenching's video for the piano ballad \"The Most Attractive Disguise\" is home-movie-style footage of Dan McCarthy rowing a boat, beer in the drink holder, singing to the camera about his friend's relationship advice: \"loneliness ain't half as bad as being with someone who's making you sad \/ cause no matter how dark it gets at night \/ at least you're the one who turns out the lights\"\u2014and then a very \"Life Goes On\" chorus of \"la-de-da\". There's something so likably matter-of-fact about the video, the song, and the album from which it comes, the band's second LP Calamity Drenching. Recorded at McCarthy's home on 8-track, the album humbly offers 12 songs about thunderstorms, drinking, and relationships crumbling. The facts of life, in other words. McCarthy's acoustic guitar-playing can echo '70s singer-songwriters and road-worn troubadours. His voice does the same, whether he's singing along to his guitar or piano. His songs have wit, and can also break your heart. The final song, \"Song for the Four Horseman\", is a quiet epic, a plea for tenderness from someone who has been around the block. \"If my hands are shaking \/ it's the coffee or it's the cold,\" he sings in that same matter-of-fact way, without affect"}

{"text":"Interview #12: Jenna-G\n\nFri, 2003-06-06 12:51\n\nUn-Cut - one of the most hotly tipped UK urban acts of 2003 released their debut album 'The Un-Calculated Some' in summer 2003 via WEA\/M Records. Un-Cut vocalist Jenna G is a remarkably talented individual and a diva in the making. Not only do her soaring vocals add a gold-edged touch of class to Un-Cut's already mesmerising arrangements, but she also starred as the eponymous lead character in Danny Boyle's (The Beach, Trainspotting) widely acclaimed film 'Strumpet.'\n\nBut music is Jenna's first love and began to pursue that love further when Un-Cut producers Darren and 2D discovered her in the hip-hop group Subliminal Darkness. Having had a huge underground hit last year with 'Midnight' selling out its 10,000 copy run on Wired Productions, Un-Cut signed to WEA\/M Records and began work on their debut album. Whilst the essence of 'The Un-Calculated Some' is rooted in Motown and Northern soul, Un-Cut take these classic influences and mould them into something invigorating, fresh and, above all else, new.\n\nI Like Music caught up with Jenna-G a few days before the release of Un-Cuts album, The Un-Calculated Some\n\n''I like music because\u2026 it is my life.'' Jenna G, Un-cut\n\nILM: So how has the year been for you so far? You kicked off the first festival of the summer - Homelands? How was that? Did you manage to catch any of the other acts?\n\nJenna: Homelands was really good this year and the whole year has been crazy too. Homelands was our first festival of the year and we were on right at the beginning of the day, so we had the rest of the day to walk around and it was a really good day, had a great time.\n\nI watched Audio Bullys who were really good and bought their album as a result. I saw Junior Senior but I have to say I wasn't impressed. I was looking forward to it, because I love that 'Everybody' tune, but their set just really baffled me, so I left half way through it. We also saw De La Soul and The Streets. [Click here to read the ilikemusic.com review of Homelands 2003]\n\nILM: And can you give me a highlight from your recent tour with Lamb?\n\nJenna: The highlight was our day off in Brighton. I'd never been to Brighton before and it's really nice. I really like Brighton and I'll be going back. The bars on the beach are wicked, I love the vibe down there.\n\nThe Lamb tour was mad because we'd just finished touring with Craig David and went straight into the Lamb tour, and you couldn't have two more different tour experiences - the Lamb tour was very much a grounding experience having toured with Craig David, because we shared a crew with Lamb so it was more like a big family and Craig David is a very nice bloke. Couldn't say a word wrong about him. All his crew and band and security were really nice, which was not what we'd expected at all.\n\nILM: And would you like to work with Mr David or anyone else in the industry in particular?\n\nJenna: I'd like to work with almost anyone. If a miracle was to happen I'd love to work with Prince. But anyone that I'm into musically it'd be great for them to feel the same about us. It's weird because you still meet people at industry parties and kind of act like of a fan, but then they do the same and say, 'ooh I've heard this about you,' and it's nice but really weird and I still don't know what to say to people.\n\nILM: Your single Fallin' is out NOW, (just been released) - can you give us your own personal description of it and it's whole vibe?\n\nJenna: Fallin' is a really nice summer tune. It just oozes summer really. The song itself is about me falling back in love with someone I used to fancy, and that's the twist in it, because you're remembering the good times but also that it did go bad, and it did that for a reason. So it's like a reminiscent kind of vibe. When we made the tune and went to make the video we just wanted loads of sunshine, and that's what we got.\n\nILM: Can you also tell me a bit about the tune from your debut album, The Un-Calculated Some' that you a) like the most personally and b) had the most fun making?\n\nJenna: The song I like best of all is Senseless. I like all the songs but I really like doing Senseless live and it gets the best reaction. For some reason, even though it's slow, at the end of Senseless everyone is just leaning forward and really into it, just listening. And the track I had the most fun making is Midnight still, because when we wrote it we broke into our old flat through the laundry, and so it was fun because there was criminal activity involved, plus it was such a long process and then to get such a good reaction to it, made it even more fun.\n\nILM: You've said you like to have a twist in your lyrics and write from personal experiences that are often emotional - where do you find you do your best writing? Do you have a special writing place?\n\nJenna: Not really, I kind of write anywhere and everywhere. Whenever things come into my head, as long as I've got a piece of paper and a pen, I'll write it down. Loveless, I wrote on a train coming back from London. Lost in Music I wrote in the studio literally there and then when the loop came up. It's just whenever. A lyric will come into my head and if I don't write it down it'll stop there, so it's a bit of a frantic thing, you'll often see me saying 'Gimme a pen!\n\nILM: What is your favourite un-cut lyric?\n\nJenna: I like Chinese Dog a lot because it's a massive metaphor that tune and there are a lot of clues in it. It's about someone in particular and there's lots of clues in the song about who it is about, but the only person who'll know who it is, is the person I've wrote it about and myself, and I like that. I want them to think 'oh god that's me.' But he hasn't been in contact yet, because he's a man and they don't tend to do that.\n\nILM: When you started making music together as Un-Cut there was pressure on to make every track go off on the dance floor. Do you enjoy the process of making music more now that you can produce deeper tracks?\n\nJenna: Yeah, definitely. It wasn't so much the pressure, the reason we had to make tunes for the dance floor that really went off was because we had to eat. But now, it's more like 'we're eating this week anyway', so there's less need. But we still put that pressure on ourselves anyway because we still want to hear our music on the radio and have people want to play it. But now we know we're not starving if we don't sell a tune.\n\nILM: Can you describe the un-cut process of making music?\n\nJenna: It could start anywhere. Un-Cut - it's all uncalculated like our album name suggests. I could have the lyric and then 2D and Darren might have a loop up and the lyric goes with it, or they might have a loop up and I might really like it and sit down and write some lyrics to it. So it can happen any different way, then after the first person has put their bit down, the others come and add the next bit and so on to build the track, and that's how every song has happened. And that's cool because we never sat down and said 'right, we want to make a fast tune' it's more natural.\n\nILM: What to you is the 'fundamental' constant in the ever evolving genre of drum and bass?\n\nJenna: It's Britishness. The fact that it's a very British sound is something that we should embrace and a lot of people don't. We should embrace it as one of the only music styles that we actually created ourselves, and it's something to champion. And it's such a diverse genre of music as well. It's clinical and mathematical on one hand, and then you've got live really mellow vocal drum and bass, so it's broad. And it's a genre that you can really experiment within.\n\nILM: Was Goldie ringing you to big-up Obsession a defining moment for you as a band, or are there any other ones than stand out?\n\nJenna: For the boys that was definitely the one because they would always listen to Timeless by Goldie, so they looked up to him. So for Goldie to be ringing them up and bigging up their production that was like 'wow'! They were really chuffed, and I was too. I've been a raver from whenever and knowing who Goldie was to have him tell us, we're part of the family, that was very cool.\n\nBut every moment is like that for me. Like when we did Craig David, and at the Royal Albert Hall that was crazy. And things just keep on happening.\n\nILM: Describe the boys in one word each. What word do you think they'd use to describe you?\n\nJenna: 2D would be a joker. He's just a classic joker. When he meets someone knew he won't even say hello, he's just straight in to taking the mickey out of him, and it's so funny to see how different people react. Some are just straight on it and start taking the p*ss back, and other people don't know what to do. Darren is a perfectionist. He likes everything just so. He won't wear certain colours and likes his hair a particular way. And they'd probably call me a Lush. Darren would call me giddy, or a giddy lush.\n\nILM: What's your objective as a band?\n\nJenna: Just to make more music that we're happy with and get on with it really. After the festivals we'll be going straight back into the studio, and won't be pushed into doing music we don't feel like doing. That's the uncut objective.\n\nILM: Can you tell us the hardest rejection\/knock back career wise you had to deal with and how you overcame it?\n\nJenna: I used to be in a hip hop group, and I was with them for three years and went and represented them over in Malaysia, me and a few of the other guys from the group went over and we did loads of gigs and on our return, they kicked me out of the group! I'd been with them for three years and all my efforts had been in the group for that time, so I was really gutted and didn't know what to do. But\u2026\n\nA month after that someone approached me and asked me to a night in a club, and it was from that I got my name round the MC circuit. So it was the biggest rejection I'd faced, but it resulted in me being a lot more approachable in terms of people asking me to work for them, and that boosted my confidence. It made me realise I hadn't wasted the previous three years and that people had seen me, and also it all resulted in meeting the guys and joining Un-Cut, so it's all good.\n\nILM: And what advice do you have for young singers\/MCs starting out who want to go the urban route?\n\nJenna: Wherever you're at, go out and get involved in the club scene and research your local city club scene on the internet, and if you've got something to give them, like songs, lyrics or ideas, then get in touch with DJs, studios and producers. And try and go about getting yourself experience because it's no good turning up at a record label and saying I've never done it before but I look good and can dance, and I want to sing. You need some element of experience. And put your own songs up on the internet - just make an effort.\n\nAlso the more shape of an idea or style you have the easier it'll be to hook up with someone else to execute that idea. As long as you know where you want to go and what you're about, because a lot of people get compromised when they go into the music industry. It's a case of them thinking 'if I make this kind of music then everyone will definitely buy it.' And you might be right but what longevity does that have. It's all about enjoying yourself, knowing what you want to do and just having no qualms about going out and saying 'let's do it' and every opportunity you've got to grab it and run with it. That's all I've done.\n\nILM: You did a spot of acting before Un-Cut - is that something you trained in or would like to back to in the future?\n\nJenna: I did some acting when I was little - from about 10 - 13 years old. But acting has a lot to do with what you look like, and I had a bit of puppy fat, but because of that I still wanted to perform as it's more about what is sounds like. But years later I got recognition as I was in Strumpet and that was good because they were saying, 'ok, so now you would look good naked in a film,' so I did another film after that. I love performing whether it's acting or singing. Film work is so much fun, getting drunk with a whole new family for a few weeks. But I'm in the music for the moment, but wouldn't say no to any films.\n\nILM: Who inspires you and who would you like to inspire?\n\nJenna: A lot of people inspire me. The biggest inspirations I had when I was growing up were Cole Porter and Prince. I'd just like anyone to listen to our music and like it really. I'd love it if someone who'd inspired me liked me. We had a singer from America who wanted to buy one of our tracks, someone I've looked up to for ages, and that was like wow. But I was like, no let's not sell it this time.\n\nILM: Can you describe your favourite place on earth?\n\nJenna: Barbados!\n\nILM: What is in your CD player right now?\n\nJenna: Roots - Phrenology. It's brilliant and everyone loves it as well, so I just keep playing"}
{"text":"S: [laughs] She lives in LA. She's in LA right now doing a movie.. We're actually got together the day before that.. So.. She lives in LA. I have some family you know, My family spread out around the world. All over the places.\n\nS:It's really complicated right now, since My father passed away this summer. I really don't know the details. But he founded Benihana, he was in this family bussiness for a long time.\n\nA: So you're not interested in the cooking departement?\n\nS:Naah, I can't cook. When I'm 15 till about 28 I was totally vegetarian, so I don't even eat there cause Benihana is a steakhouse, it's not my kind of food I don't eat any meat at all. But now I ate any kinds of food, I'll eat anything, except dogs..\n\nA: I don't eat dogs too, but some people in Indonesia eat dogs.\n\nS:[laugh] I had a dog, he was my bestfriend, I can't eat my bestfriend.\n\nA: Umm.. So How's your Dim Mak records..\n\nS:Well I've been doing the label since 1996, it's been 12 years, we put out over 130 records. we've been through a lot of changes. I started putting out hardcore bands, emo, indie bands. And some rock and roll bands. Now we're putting a lot of electronic dance music, MSTRKRFT and Armin Van Helden, etc..\n\nA: So You're just basically sign the bands that You liked.S:Yeah. Pretty much my interest changed too, so I'm trying to do something different everytime. Now we sign many great bands.\n\nA: So the genre is pretty wide-ranged too, from punk to instrumental electronics?\n\nS:Yeah, from Mistery Jets to whitey, SHitdisco to The Icarus Line. We put out many bands from different genres..\n\nA: How's you're the kids reception to your album (Pillowface and His Airplane Chronicles, 2008)? Any good reactions?\n\nS:That's a fun process, it took a long time to do (the album \u2013ed). It's very upbeat music. It's kinda like a hybrid between American hiphop and European dance music. I'm hoping to do a new record next year.\n\nA: I hear that blackmetal has new fans, and kids in the states are into blackmetal now.. S:I don't know about that, but yeah, metal is so constant, it's a crazy thing. it'll never go away. Trends come and go but metal never go away, certain things is a trend, like electro you know? But metal is not a trend.\n\nA: I read an article in Adbusters that say that Hipster is a dead culture. What are your opinions about the hipster culture?\n\nS:The whole idea about the hipster culture, is a trend, a cycle. It such a vague terms, that the hipster to me are adbusters, the people who read the adbusters are the real hipsters. I mean I don't know what really is a hipster to me hipster nowadays are defined by the fashion, the first thing to do is wanting to dress different, fashion-forward, unique and fashionable. And hype. Some sort of.. relevant to current trendy music. They know what MSTRKRFT and Justice are. They have Ksubi jeans, and the coolest sunglasses, the new pair of shoes.. maybe the terms will change. The actual idea of a hipster will actually change.\n\nA: So that \"Hipster\" culture nowadays are pushed more into consumerism?\n\nS:It can be called whatever. People will always want to looked like the part of 2009 era. They wanna wear the coolest trends, and know all the new songs. No one wants to look dated. A part of a culture is consumerism. In order to have a culture you have to consume, I guess there's always this anti-consumerism aspect in every culture. It's tougher for them to thrive and exist. Yeah man, that's a pretty clever way of putting it. But I just don't thing the hipster thing will go away. Even if it goes, then something else will pop up and replace that hipster thing. So the American apparel that someday no one will cares about isn't gonna be the case, because they are a business that concern about the next fashion statement so it always a good thing. So if people are buying things and consuming, they will always be the next hipsters, no matter what, cause there are no such terms as dated-hipsters. This hipster conversation is a really good one. The demise of a hipster. Let's just say.. let's kill all the hipsters. The idea of a hipster and the theory of a hipster and let start over. Let's kill the idea of a consumeristic fashion trends. I rather be friends with someone wearing a bad brains t-shirt like you than some million dollar fashion guy. That fashion guy is not a hipster, that guy also hates adbusters. He supports McCain too, maybe (laughs). Now Obama is the hipster type.\n\nA: Ok, so what stuff are you gonna play tonight?\n\nS:A lot of my own music production of course. I like your bad brains shirt, I love bad brains. I have a gorrila biscuits tattoo actually, you wanna see it? (Steve show his GB tattoo on his back)"}

What\nmakes that one stand out more than the rest?\nIt's just one that stands out in my head\nas its been constantly good the whole time and\nit seems to always have the write balance of\nmentalness and listening, because if there to\nlistening you don't get enough vibe and\nif they are to mental it slightly messes up\nthe vibe so there is a sweet spot.\n\nYou\nare well used to playing festivals across the\nUK, can we expect to see you playing many this\nyear?\nYeah we have quite a few this year but we are\nlooking at doing loads next year, we did a lot\nlast year and even headlined a few small festivals\nwhich was intense as I was doing it as a solo\nact on my own and was on after acts like The\nBlockheads which have 9 members, so I walked\nout on stage and was like yeah it's just\nme but I've got a lot of toys and make\na lot of noise.\n\nYou\nare also well known for your amazing cover versions\nof songs like 'Teardrop', 'It\nMust Be Love' and 'Bohemian Rhapsody',\nif you could cover any other song that you haven't\nyet what would it be and why?\nI did Bohemian Rhapsody that would defiantly\nbe in my list if I hadn't already done\nit, I would really like to do something from\nCharlie And The Chocolate Factory, I messed\naround with 'Pure Imagination' a\nwhile ago so I might record that as an extra\ntrack at some point, it is on the internet somewhere\nas I did it for BBC Three about British song\nwriters and I found out that the guy who wrote\nthe old lyrics was Anthony Newly so I figured\nthat was a good excuse.\n\nYou\nforthcoming EP 'Sketches' was originally\ndown to be released on the 19th April but has\nsince been delayed until the 20th May, what was\nthe reason behind this?\nIt was basically put up wrong and I thought\nwe could change the stuff on there but we had\nto take it down and resubmit it as you can't\nchange stuff which seems like a major flaw as\nwe are adding more songs for the same money,\nI could understand if we were taking things\naway and still charging the same money.\n\nYour\nlatest song 'Write It On Your Skin'\nis a nice up beat track with a real fun video,\nhow did you find writing the track and creating\nthe video?\nThe video has been calmed down a hell of a lot\nand I am a little upset about it as it got censored\nfor being too stupid there was some really mad\nstuff on there so I may release the x rated\nversion, but it's not that x rated as\nthere was no nudity or anything.\n\nWriting the song was strange as I wrote the\nverses over two years ago and from the second\nit came into my head I really liked it and then\nI went on and wrote 15 different choruses for\nit but none ticked all the right boxes for me\npersonally, so I was writing with my brother\nand his old band mates which was quite weird\nas it was me and my brother and him and his\nband so there was two sets of brothers so it\nwas a Faulkner, Faulkner Thin lassen tune and\nthey actually had the \"I can't,\nI can't\" bit but they had it in\ndifferent verses and with a different song but\nthey weren't going to do anything with\nit so we asked if we could use it so all in\nall it was quite a strange birth. But\na good birth?\nYeah defiantly it was frustrating in the middle\nbut it came out good in the end and it happens\nto be the first track I have ever produced and\nat the time I was just making a demo and never\nin a million years thought id produce a song.\n\nYou\nhave been busy working on your third studio album\nand it is due for release in July, what can you\ntell us about it?\nIt's got a different vibe from the last\ntwo albums and that's mainly due to the\ntime separation between the albums and slightly\nbecause of a different writing approach as I\nrealised that playing live was kind of like\nmy home so I wrote it to be played live, generally\nmathematically all the tempos have gone up its\nactually faster than the first two but at the\nsame time it's much easier going, it's\nweird because when I first put everything together\nI was like this is a driving album how did I\ndo that but it's also weird because the\nfirst album was considered as a surfing album\nand I can't surf and now I've done\na driving album and I can't drive either,\nmaybe the next one will something I can do like\nthe falling over album.\n(laughter)\n\nHow\nhave you found working on your third album compared\nto your previous albums?\nI have learnt more about what I want to do and\nhow everything works but writing has always\nbeen the same for me but one of the amazing\nrevelations is that you should never keep up\nwith the music industry and change what you\ndo to keep with the times because it's\nreally weird that what I did became relevant\nat one point and then suddenly it wasn't\nrelevant and now it is relevant again, so it's\nstrange doing the same thing all the time and\nthrough the years being told its cool or its\nnot cool any more. Yeah\nthat really is how the music industry is at the\nmoment with trends changing far to quick.\nYour jeans are too baggy and there too tight\nnow.\n(Laughter)\nSo yeah I just stick to what I've always\nbeen doing, I did buy a suit today. For\nany occasion?\nNot really I just didn't have a suit so\ngot one and I walked around Bristol in it and\npeople were looking like why is that guy wearing\na suit he's not a suit guy so I was trying\nto judge how people were reacting, it was quite\nfunny.\n\nOnce\nyour third studio album is out can we expect to\nsee you embark on another lengthy tour across\nthe UK?\nYes, you can expect that for pretty much the rest\nof my life, and we are looking at multiple Sheppard's\nBushes.\n\nDo\nyou enjoy touring or do you get a bit home sick?\nI love it, obviously I miss home and I miss\nplaying with my son and stuff but touring is\nan important part of what I do and I totally\nlove it and wouldn't do it if I didn't,\nand when I'm in the studio I will be talking\nto someone and be like you know what I need\na nice relaxing tour. Yeah\nsome people like touring but they are also happy\nto be home.\nYeah I am happy when I get back but im always\nlike I want to get going again, I always find\nit hard finishing tours because you get home\nand everything you have been doing for the past\nfew weeks is not there and you have to find\nthings to do and I always tend to get ill after\ntours because I seem to fend off getting ill\non tour as I think adrenaline kills illnesses\nand stops things taking hold.\n\nWhat\nwould you say your main highs and lows as a musician\nhave been so far?\nI haven't had really many musical low\npoints, there's the art crossovers which\nare obviously going to be uncomfortable especially\nif you care about what you are doing which unfortunately\nI do. Highs is all gig stuff like playing Isle\nOf White and all the Glastonbury's I have\ndone which have all been positive experiences,\nbut gigs in general are just amazing as at the\nmoment I'm doing 10 or 11 new songs and\npeople are really into it and having a good\ntime and I was prepared to change the set list\nbut realised that I didn't have to as\npeople have been really into it and its been\nweird seeing people singing words to songs that\nhaven't been released yet.\n\nYou\nhave just released a crowd reward app on Facebook,\nhow does this work and what has the response been\nlike so far?\nIt has been good so far, it's just a big\nsocial network tool where you reach out to people\nwith tweets etc and the more people that use\nit and encourage their friends to use it get\nsomething when it reaches certain goals like\n25,000 \u2013 30,000 people etc. And at the\nmoment I have been doing panoramic sweep crowd\nshots and people have been logging on to find\nthemselves at the gigs.\n\nWhat\nwould your advice be to fans who want to get into\nplaying live music?\nJust go out and play live, I know the manager\nfrom Radiohead was asked the same question recently\nand he just said give you music away which is\nquite interesting, in my eyes it's all\nabout profile if you get a good profile you\ncan do the gigs, sell the merch, release music\netc so it's all about getting that original\nname but I'm not sure I entirely agree\nwith giving your music away, but I suppose its\nonly pocket money you get it won't be\nyour main source of income. Yeah\nwhen you think about these massive bands they\ndon't get much money from the music it's\nall from the tours and merch.\nTouring is defiantly the main thing for income,\nbut it's weird as it is the opposite of\nwhat it used to be, people used to tour to promote\nthe album as the album would generate the money\nwhilst the tour would lose money but now it is\nthe other way round.\n\nWhere\ndo you hope to see yourself in a year's\ntime?\nI will defiantly be touring and I just hope\nto get better at what I do and take each day\nas it comes. People often ask me what my definition\nof making it in the music industry is and it's\nnot having to do anything else and if you can\ndo that have a house and sustain a whole way\nof life then that is pretty well going.\n\nOne\nlast random question that we ask every band, if\nyou could be an animal out of a zebra or Giraffe\nwhich one would you be and why?\nGiraffe because necks are fun and they have\nless predators, was that a good answer? Yeah\nthe Giraffe is a popular one.\nYou see a Giraffe and they are casually eating\nand you look at a Zebra and there is always\nsomething behind it ready to eat it, but Zebras\ndo have a good relationship with Bisons.\n\nThanks\nfor your time is there a message for your fans\nreading this?\nThanks"}
{"text":"It's like Cat Power if she had someone who loved her. It's like Adele if she knew how to dance. It's like the Rolling Stones if they were still alive. Where can anyone go from here except sideways?\n\nWith that hyperbole to wade through, I was shocked \u2013 SHOCKED! \u2013 by how much I enjoyed the Kiwi chanteuse's single. I'm going to admit something slightly embarrassing now: I actually quite like that Gotye single she sang on. (Emphasis on \"quite\" here, let's not go overboard. I quite like it in exactly the same way as I quite like the occasional song by Sting or Peter Gabriel, because it sounds exactly the f***ing same as something by Sting or Peter Gabriel.) I'm coming in from a position of not-hate. Even so, I was unprepared for this.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nIt's a neon pink song. A bright bubblegum fizz of verve and sparkle. It's bold, and quite literally brassy. It's fun, exciting, and doesn't have the slightest intention of sending you to sleep. In other words, it's the polar opposite of the Gotye songs that aren't Somebody That I Used To Know.\n\nThis is what pop music ought to sound like. It has the plunking strings and rich denseness of old Motown but the delicious basslines of those modern pop songs that mistake hooks for actual melody. It keeps scampering off in different directions. It's got the drums from Be My Baby. It's breathless enthusiasm and giddy first crushes and unfettered joy without the slightest hint of cynicism. I'm entirely in agreement with the Youtube commenter: this is how The Matrix should have ended."}
{"text":"Music Review: Toro Y Moi, \"Anything in Return\" (Carpark)\n\nChazwick Bundick's prolific output as Toro Y Moi resulted in a time-compressed evolution, and his third album since 2009, \"Anything in Return,\" takes the laptop musician into laid-back, high-gloss R&B. The overall sheen and the beats-per-minute increase on opening tracks \"Harm in Change\" and \"Say That\" could result in a sideline as a track producer for big-budget pop acts, but there is enough of Toro Y Moi's signature swooning midtempo songs to keep Bundick's core listeners from defecting.\n\nChief among the changes on \"Anything in Return\" is diminished gauziness. While the dreamy textures on 2011's \"Underneath the Pine\" were key selling points, Bundick has retained the elegance but sharpened the arrangements and production. There are slight callbacks to old sound in the bright soul track \"Studies,\" but elsewhere Toro Y Moi is exploring bass-heavy slow jams (\"High Living\") and a few tracks that strive for something close to pop perfection (\"Cake\").\n\nNotably, Bundick's highest profile fan is LeBron James, and it's easy to fall back on the idea that the Miami Heat star's patronage is partly responsible for Toro Y Moi's move toward R&B grooves, but the best songs on \"Underneath the Pine,\" \"New Beat\" and \"Still Sound\" actually laid the groundwork for the prevailing musical themes on \"Anything in Return.\" If late-night jams such as \"Day One\" and the gloriously bright, Michael Jackson-like grooves of \"Never Matter\" result in Toro Y Moi getting some freelance gigs building beats for chart acts, mainstream pop music could be better for"}
{"text":"Interview: Luke Top from Fool's Gold on Being a Paralegal, Singing in Hebrew, and the Lost Art of Improvisation\n\nBands that list too many influences tend to sound like a mess. So what does Fool's Gold, a band that's a goulash of Ethiopian soul music, Touareg music from Mali, Congolese secousse music, Eritrean soul music, tropicalia, and '80s dance hits (and with Hebrew singing thrown in for good measure) sound like? Basically, they sound like a wide-open dance party. The Los Angeles-based octet, led by guitarist Lewis Pesacov and lead singer Luke Top, is playing the Music Hall of Williamsburg tonight, and so we got the frontman on the phone to talk about the musician's day job, the lost art of improvisation, and singing in Hebrew.\n\nI'm calling you kinda late at night because you just got home from your day job as a paralegal. Do you ever have moments where you're sitting at your desk, staring at some memo, and you just sort of take a deep breath and go, \"I'm going on tour next week, I'm going on tour next week, just five more days, and I'll be on tour...\"?\n\n[laughs] You know, sadly, there haven't been enough moments where I can pause and think about my life in any sort of way these past few months. It's just been about getting through the now, and I'll deal with the next moment when I get there. I'm just so busy with so much shit. But obviously, in the back of my head I have visions of the open road, snow falling, being up on stage and people dancing. There's not a whole lot of joy in my office.\n\nI was surprised to hear that you and Lewis [Pesacov, Fool's Gold's other founding member] both have real, grown-up jobs. I've been conditioned to think that everybody who plays in a band is either a bartender or a barista or sells pot or something. The only exception I can ever remember hearing about is Girl Talk. He was some kind of bio-mechanical engineer or something, and in interviews he used to talk about how desperately he tried to keep his co-workers from finding out about his music.\n\nThat's funny, I had a similar experience. I've been a paralegal for so long, and one day somebody in the office just Googled me, and things started coming up, and I had to explain to everybody that this [music] is what I do; this is just my job. [laughs] But this is my last week of being what you'd consider a level-headed adult. But I think having this thing that I have to do every day makes music-making that much more important. There's this weird tension of having all these different identities at once, and I feel really accomplished because I made two records this year and held down the day job. It feels really good. I think when you're stagnant, I tend to not get a whole lot accomplished. So when I've also got to work, it makes it even more important that I get music shit done.\n\nMarianne Williams\n\nLuke Top, top left\n\nSo let's get to your musical identity, then. Your songwriting partner, Lewis, already had something going musically with Foreign Born, a group that Fool's Gold has kind of swallowed up.\n\nI don't know if everybody shares the opinion of Fool's Gold swallowing up Foreign Born...[laughs]\n\nI don't think so. They're all my really good friends, and it's all really open. Most of Foreign Born is in Fool's Gold. Like the singer from Foreign Born plays guitar in Fool's Gold, and their drummer has been our drummer since we started.\nThe whole thing with Fool's Gold is that it's not like we sat down and said, \"Arright, we're going to branch out, we're going to restructure, and we're gonna take off!\" It was never like that.\n\nNo hostile takeover.\n\nI mean, the first year we were a band we'd say, \"Anyone who wants in, come down! We're playing a barbecue, we're playing a party, whatever.\" It was such an open environment that rather than hostility, I think everybody who played with us felt liberated by Fool's Gold. It was kind of a free and open thing where there was no answer, where there weren't any rigid roles or anything, and that's kind of emblematic of our band and our music.\n\nLet's stay with that subject of openness for a second. Your live shows are so wide open and free compared to most western rock\/pop bands. I read another interview where your bandmates made it sound like you all start feeling and thinking the same things. Can you elaborate on that at all?\n\nThere's definitely this thing that happens. Sometimes, when we start our songs, I think what we're all trying to do is tap into a moment together, and sometimes it takes longer to do that, but what I love so much about this music is it allows you to be patient. And if you're patient when you're playing, then sometimes you can just walk into one of those magical things that makes all the hard work and all the bullshit that comes with it worthwhile. You know, eight people from different backgrounds finding this place together. And the audience definitely can feel that. I feel like we're all living in the moment, and locking in, and thank God it keeps happening, because it makes me want to keep doing shows and going on tours. And I think it's more special because there are so many people involved; it makes you feel more selfless.\n\nI feel like that's become something of a lost art in North American pop music. It's kind of gotten to the point where if you describe a band as a great live band, or a party band, it's almost a backhanded compliment.\n\nI agree with you, I don't understand it. Music is all about having a moment shared. I think there are a lot of bands out there who have a business model and all these priorities. Our only priority is to make it fun and different every time, and the only way to do that is to have it be different every time. I really feel like I can dig into this music every single time. It's like a miracle. It's so open, you have so much freedom--I mean, there's a lot of structure too--but as a singer, I can come in whenever I want, I can yelp and scream and also sing. I dunno, with my personality, I just [enjoy] the feeling of, \"Wow, I don't have to sing my part right now!\" I can get into it a little. It's such a cool thing."}
{"text":"We asked Emilie's manager for interview with her(we wanted face to face one, but we coulden't so at least we had opportunity to ask her some wuestions by mail) so we send Emilie some questions, here are her answers I think that few things are pretty interesting and Polish Muffins want to share it with the rest of the world\n\n1. I would like to ask you about few things concerning your upcoming album, Fight Like A Girl. First one is about my favorite song so far, Take The Pill. Could you please tell us what \"The Pill\" actually is? A psychiatric drug, anticonception pill or maybe something else? EA: In 'Take The Pill', the actual pill is anything you want it to be. As we all know, the world of western medicine is filled with doctors who over-prescribe drugs to their patients. Often, the patient does not need the drug, and often, the doctor is being paid by the drug company to prescribe it to people, even though it may be unsafe, untested, or unnecessary. In some extreme cases, we are forced to take these drugs, when incarcerated within a mental hospital for example. I've been put into a line with other mental patients and given drugs with names I didn't even know while the nurses watched to make sure I didn't spit them out or hide them underneath my tongue. We were being experimented on, and we were told we would be just fine, but most of us weren't. Some of these drugs have altered my mind and changed the way I think forever. I will never be the same. The medical community denies that this happens. The drug companies deny that these side effects could even possible exist. We are all called liars. But the worst thing is when you actually do need a drug, and it has horrible, life-ruining side effects, but you have to take it anyway, every day, simply in order to stay alive. You need the drug, but you hate the drug. It keeps you alive but it makes your life miserable. These are the drugs I am on now, and this is why the song is so angry.\n\n2. We heard 7 songs from new album so far. But what about the rest of the album? What does it sounds like? (I'm particulary interested in Emilie's Theme and Secret FLAG Recording)\n\nEA: The entire album was meant to be a soundtrack to the show, which is meant as just a small part of the Broadway-esque theatrical musical production that my book is being made into as we speak. The thing that makes this album unique is that it truly does take the listener on a complete journey from beginning to end. It's not a rock album \u2013 it's made for the theatre.\n\n3. What would you say to the people who claim that Fight Like A Girl is misandric? EA: I don't see how anyone could claim anything as the entire album hasn't been released yet, but, in any case, I don't think it's necessary to explain. The song and the album title\/concept speak for themselves, and their meaning is very obvious. If it doesn't make sense to someone, they are probably not the right audience for it, and that's perfectly alright with me. 4. Changing topic: you are now blonde which is come back to your natural hair color. I wonder, why did you choose to dye your hair back then and why did you choose red\/pink colours? EA: The blond wasn't really a personal choice as much as it was necessary for my character in Darren Bousman and Terrance Zdunich's new film 'The Devil's Carnival.' In the film, I play this charming creature called Painted Doll who also happens to be quite evil and nasty, though she does get to sing some amazing songs. As to the red and pink hair colours, both of which I will very likely return to at some point as I still very much identify with them, I had a vision of myself with red hair several years ago, and, after trying it, felt more like myself than I ever had before. At the moment though, I am sporting the giant mohawk on stage, and I feel more beautiful when wearing that than I ever have. 5. Changing topic completly now: What is your biggest dream? EA: To launch the 'Asylum\u2026' musical on London's West End in 2014. 6. How do you see yourself in 20-30 years? EA: Still looking good in a corset.\n\nI'm so happy to read that (especially because the question 1-4 are mine) that I cannot express it well. Thank you EA! And thanks for Melissa King for infinite amount of patience for us! Sorry for making your work terrible, we Polish people just love EA too much\n\n@INMATE_W17S, EA answered half of questions we sent to her maybe one day we will get more responses...*dreaming*\n\n@LadyCyanide, maybe she found it flattering that in such small country (we all love stereotypes, hehe) there are so much active muffins. I hiope that one day, the interview you mentioned will also come"}
{"text":"The record is Hitchcock's first since since 2011's Tromso, Kaptein and 2010's more widely distributed Propellor Time, which he recorded with The Venus 3 (composed of R.E.M.'s Peter \"Mr. Stingy Broom\" Buck, Scott McCaughey and Bill Rieflin). Hitchcock didn't want to talk about any of the songs from the album, though. He says there are \"no back stories or front stories\" to them.\n\n\"I don't usually write songs with anything intentional in mind,\" Hitchcock told Spinner. \"It's like a Ouija board and I see what comes through. If you try and make a song be about something, it can be a bit contrived. I can make points in interviews or if I'm on stage, but I don't think they particularly work in songs.\"\n\nFrom there Hitchcock went on a long spiel about genetic composition, animals and religion by concluding:\n\n\"We need a kind of evolutionary upgrade. Otherwise we're just plunging more people into misery, which is enhanced by technology, but is misery nonetheless. But I can't really get all of this into songs. So that's why I'm giving you my world view.\"\n\nHitchcock did, however, provide this succinct overview of Love From London:\n\n\"The songs came from London and a lot of them are love songs. It's a very literal description of the way the songs are. It's a fairly good-hearted record. I'm not wishing too much ill will on anybody. There's a rant about the decline of capitalism ('Fix You'), but otherwise I'm generally being pretty friendly. For me, it's a pretty upbeat record.\"\n\nEnvironmental concerns are also touched on, which isn't surprising since Hitchcock took part in the 2008 Cape Farewell expedition to the west coast of Greenland to help raise awareness of the effects of climate change, and he's noted rainfall and temperature patterns changing in London over the past 15 years. But he offered no easy solutions to the problem.\n\n\"There's a projected sea level rise of several meters by the end of the century because of a rise in temperature of several centigrade because nobody wants to give up their cars, and people like me don't want to stop flying because that's how we make a living,\" he says. \"I could fly around the world telling people not to fly. The problem is that the mechanisms we've set up to live by are destructive, but it's very difficult to change them.\n\n\"It's as if we've taken off in a plane and someone said halfway, 'We have to stop burning aviation fuel and we're going to have to do this on electricity.' What are we going to do, change the engines while we're flying? We can't just put life on hold while we rewire and restructure our energy systems.\"\n\nHitchcock turned 60 on March 3 and played a special concert in London where he was joined by some of his favorite British musicians to perform one song from each of his albums, starting with Love From London and working back through his solo efforts to his work with The Egyptians and finally to his '70s material with neo-psychedelic, post-punk act the Soft Boys.\n\n\"You'll get your fill of men over 50 with electric guitars,\" said Hitchcock, who claims he has offers to play in Canada in early September but hasn't confirmed anything. He'd prefer if they were solo acoustic shows.\n\n\"The electric guitar is alright, but it has a lot more baggage. You have to have an amplifier and pedals and someone to set the stuff up and carry all the shit around. I'm too old to haul around amplifiers. I have back problems. I have hernia problems. I'm lazy and I can't be hauling gear. And then you plug it in and turn it on and you can't hear yourself sing. I just think, 'Screw it. I'm too old for this.'\""}
{"text":"Death Cab For Cutie - I Will Follow You Into The Dark (Atlantic)\n\nUK release date: 17 July 2006\n\nThis is the latest release from US cult band's latest album Plans. Don't be put off by the name, though: they're more of an indie outfit, but have recently become better known for their quiet acoustic numbers.\n\nThis track is a perfect example, with its solitary singer and guitar theme. The whole thing has a tender and sensitive yet sorrowful feel to it - not entirely surprising as the reference to following into the dark is about death. There's a depth and feeling to it that is a world away from the summery fluff that usually appears at this time of year.\n\nThere was a distinct chance that this could have ended up being so wrist-slittingly morose it could only bear one listen. However, the tear-filled melancholic feel is countered by the beauty of the lyrics and the basic message that, even at the end, if you're with the person you love then even that would be endurable. You'll probably cry when you hear this, but you'll still play it again and it's well worth the money - though you're unlikely to see it bothering the top 20."}

Thanks, in part, to Italian food, that third record is on its way.\n\nThe Low Anthem recently spent six weeks recording \"in a beautiful studio we set up in a decrepit, old abandoned pasta sauce factory in Central Falls, Rhode Island,\" according to Miller. The giant open space had a similarly expansive effect on the upcoming, still untitled album. The factory did have its drawbacks, though. Namely, its risk of ending the band members lives.\n\n\"The landlord gave it to us for six weeks, but we had to sign a death waiver,\" says Miller. \"If we died, it wasn't his fault and he could look the other way.\" Needless to say, the band made it out unscathed and has been playing assorted new tunes on the road, including dates on the current and largely sold-out tour with the Avett Brothers.\n\n\"The space was like an airplane hangar. It's so big that there's the opportunity to create massive, massive reverb,\" Miller says. \"You can put a mic 200 feet away in the other corner and it gets the sound as it barrels through the room. The sound was unbelievable. [The album] sounds like the space it was recorded in.\"\n\nWhile the previous album, especially with its Charles Darwin focus, sounded natural and rootsy, Miller says the new music takes that organic element to a new level. \"Where there's space on the last record, it's artificially created because we recorded it in a tiny room,\" he says. \"We didn't have to use ProTools or anything -- we just set up the room mics.\"\n\nThough Miller isn't sure exactly when the new record will hit shelves, he's excited to be debuting a new set of songs for the first time in two years. \"We just went into the studio and did the same thing we've always done -- listen to the music and make it as beautiful as we can. Whatever happens, whatever the press thinks of it, it's a really sincere effort,\" says Miller. \"Everyone'll hear, for the first time in years, a set of songs that aren't about Charles Darwin.\""}

On it, you'll find 8 songs harkening the rich heritage and tradition of great American country and folk music past, rounded out by the strong DIY ethic and punk progressiveness that played a large part in shaping both artist and label over the years. In the end, you're left with an album that reaches across generational and genre lines in a way that few artists could ever dream of or hope for."}
{"text":"Tools\n\nIs it safe to come out now? Being a Pearl Jam fan has never been easy--particularly for about a decade now--but it's getting (slightly) easier. Arguably, the band's last solid album was 1996's No Code; the albums in that disappointing gulf in between had an increasing dearth of bright spots. Inconsistency had become troublingly, well, consistent.\n\nWith Pearl Jam, the band recaptures the spark that ignited a generation some 15 years ago with Eddie Vedder--who has returned his vocals to their gruff glory--and company playing like men possessed by their former selves. This album proves the group has always had more in common with Springsteen and The Who than any flannel-clad musical fad of yesteryear.\n\nOver the 13 tracks of this eponymous powder keg, Pearl Jam muster enough kinetic energy, exuberant charm and political relevancy to make their youthful successors appear catatonic or apathetic. They're not reinventing the wheel, just greatly improving upon it for those of us who still care.\n\nHigh spots include the spiraling, terse structure of \"Parachutes,\" the one-two knockout of raging guitars and throbbing rhythm that are \"Life Wasted\" and \"World Wide Suicide,\" and the ringing working-class anthem \"Unemployable.\"\n\nTaking a recent page from their forefathers (Springsteen and Young), the group dedicates the heft of Pearl Jam to politics both foreign and domestic, but looser moments like the spiky \"Big Wave\" prove the album was likely constructed with equal parts excitement and urgency. They're still alive; deal with it."}
{"text":"Picks and Pans Review: No. 4\n\nGrunge is dead and rock music is in a lull, so where does that leave the Stone Temple Pilots? The answer for this million-selling L.A. quartet is, surprisingly, better (and louder) than ever. Despite an out-of-vogue sound and lead singer Scott Wei-land's drug-related prison term, the band sounds supremely confident on this reunion disc. Discarding the pretensions of earlier albums, which often mimicked the darkly melodic perspective of bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the Pilots land in refreshing new territory. \"Heaven and Hot Rods\" combines hard-driving guitars with a boogie beat, while \"Atlanta\" finds the band basking in a sunny, mid-'70s folk-rock groove. Finally, these highfliers are worth championing."}
{"text":"MGMT\n\nby Wendy Ding: IllustrationAt last, my illustration of MGMT is complete! I captured the band in a visual fashion akin to the sound they're famous for: kaleidoscopically psychedelic.\n\nI've been meaning to illustrate in a format other than the standard square or rectangle. The circle felt perfect since it's representative of the kaleidoscope viewfinder and it's the shape of a vinyl record so there's an added tie to the music theme. I gave each band member a plethora of colours scattered with geometric shapes and a prism for the kaleidoscope effect. Also in the mix are corresponding music instruments!\n\nThe most fun and challenging part was fitting the funky shapes and instruments into the prism while looking like a kaleidoscope and not overshadowing the band members. I practically lived in a kaleidoscope for a week rearranging and tweaking the opacity, tilt and size of each shape. It was certainly a labour of love!

{"text":"Shilpa Ganatra, 17 Oct 2005\n\nThe word 'deep' has been bastardized by stoner hippies discussing why stars are, like, so far away. But its rightful use is in the description of the third album by Dublin's own BellX1, which, just by being the follow-up to 2003's breakthrough album Music In Mouth, was always set to be spectacular. The initial question was whether it would be spectacularly disappointing or sublime, and in fact the answer is that it's spectacularly deep. In the correct sense of the word.\n\nDive in and one becomes immediately become submerged in the quirky sounds of 'Flame', a hip-shaking affair which will inspire congo lines at gigs, drunken versions at karaoke and an absent-minded hum while hoovering. Then float along with the reflective 'Rocky Took A Lover' which is a lullaby of a song, a cacophony of sound and a dark story all at once, a fusion made possible by the tact with which it's pulled off.\n\nBut its The eight-minute ballad closer 'Lamp Posts' is a perfect example, as is the song that wins the Grower Of The Album award, 'Trampalene'. The lyrics too are revealed piecemeal, although not as witty as some of their best (see 'Eve, The Apple Of My Eye' from Flock's predecessor).\n\nAnd when you think you've gotten to the bottom of the album, it takes on new forms with repeated plays. Given the thought that has gone into Flock \u2013 songs were carefully road tested and went through different permutations - and the talent it takes to realise, Paul Noonan and his band of merry men have much of which to be proud. Not only have they purposefully pushed themselves far further than would have sufficed, but in doing so they've proved they've everything in their backpack to be as big they imagine.

{"text":"It's a funny bit of chemistry; how a cool car makes a guy seem that much cooler.\n\nSaturday, June 20, 2009\n\nMusic Review: That Dog. - Retreat from the Sun (1997)\n\nI have always liked That Dog, ever since I first heard them, but somehow I managed to live my life without owning any of their records. That changed a few months ago when I got \"Retreat from the Sun,\" their last album, now 12 years old.\n\nThis record is so great. Basically, it's mid-nineties \"alternative\" rock but all written from a female bias. This means lots of incredible harmonies from the Haden sisters who are in the band. This means lyrics only women would come up with, like \"we'll have wedding rings and baby seats.\" The lyrics are perfect, not cliched, and give the band its own voice.\n\nTo call this album \"cutesy\" would not do it justice, because it packs a bite. It's actual pop-rock and this record holds its own against other records from their friends Weezer, and even Jawbreaker, who they counted as friends. It's also got the superhits \"Minneapolis\" and \"Long Island.\" They name-check Low in \"Minneapolis\", which I truly didn't catch until around the songs's 60th listen.\n\nThis album definitely did not do well commercially. I don't think it was popular at all. I think this is because the record label released \"Never Say Never\" as a single. This song is ok, but \"Minneapolis,\" \"Long Island,\" \"Being with you\" and \"I'm gonna see you\" are all way better songs. \"Never Say Never\" is kind of abrasive in a bad way. The other songs are super-poppy love songs.\n\nMusic nerds are always lamenting the end of some imaginary era of music, so I suggest checking out this record for a fresh serving of mid-1990s pop-rock. I really like this album and I listen to it all the time.\n\n1 comment:\n\nI see this album cover, and I still think about the excellent potential that the album has to make a big impact on me and really impress me. I remember when it came out, and I was really excited about it, because I loved their song on the DGC rarities comp so much. And I just never got it or heard it, but I always think, \"Oh man, someday that album is gonna blow me away.\" I would almost hate to lose that feeling about this record, which is what would happen if I ever actually heard it"}
{"text":"The Fray shares their \"Scars and Stories\" with third album\n\nThree weeks ago, The Fray released its third studio album, \"Scars and Stories,\" which de\u00adbuted at #4 on the Billboard Top 200 chart.\n\nAfter the overwhelming suc\u00adcess of their self-titled sopho\u00admore album (\"The Fray, 2009) the band spent the past three years writing material and travel\u00adling around gaining inspiration.\n\nUnlike the background story for \"How to Save a Life\" and \"The Fray,\" \"Scars and Stories,\" is the result of long journey for the band, as they took time to find themselves as individuals, bringing all their stories together for a total 44 minutes worth of 12 tracks. According to an interview with Vevo, the band used part of the budget for their album to travel around the world, stopping in places such as Rwanda and Switzerland.\n\nBut delving into the album as a listener, the general public may not get hear their worldly views in the lyrics, unless they've done a bit of background research.\n\n\"Scars and Stories\" gives off a feeling of loving life and loving the people around us, whether it's siblings or a significant other. The album feels like a celebra\u00adtion from their success with songs like \"Heartbeat\" and \"Turn Me On\" with its upbeat tempos and hopeful lyrics, something that is very different from their second album which discussed a lot of finding one's self.\n\nHowever the songs have a deep\u00ader meaning. In interviews, the band has explained how many of the songs have to do with their travels; they wrote around 70 about being abroad and narrowed it down finally to 12. Songs like \"Heartbeat,\" were inspired by a conversation with a Rwandan woman and \"Munich\" about the search for the \"God Particle\" in Switzerland.\n\nThe band credits a lot of the work on the third album to its new producer they worked with and fans may notice a change in the amount of upbeat songs, less ballads, but the lyrics are still all them. Die-hard fans will enjoy the whole album and fans of their heavily radio-played songs should stick with the single, \"Heartbeat.\" However tracks like the \"Wind,\" \"Munich\" and \"The Fighter\" give us a taste of com\u00admon Fray lyrics that question life and our existence.\n\n\"Scars and Stories\" is the per\u00adfect kind of pick me up album; it delivers plenty of variety with its eclectic sound, however the lyrics definitely follow a theme pertaining to a phase of life, which should be very familiar to Fray fans.\n\nWhile I love tracks such as \"Heartbeat\" and \"I Can Barely Say\" (which portrays their \"usu\u00adal\" sound with lots of piano and a softer side), the entire album promises at least one addictive track for everyone."}

{"text":"Instagram Photos\n\nSunday, July 29, 2012\n\nA New York Minute with Musician: Allen Thompson ~ By Jon\n\nWhat do Black Flag, Levon Helm, John Steinbeck, and Folk Music have in common? Allen Thompson, apparently. I sat down with him to discuss his new album, \"Salvation in the Ground\"\u2026 and everything else. You could call Thompson an Americana\/Folk artist, but you have to stop there because he seems to have no interest in maintaining that label, and he doesn't let that category dictate his music. He writes searching, honest songs that nod toward literary influences such as Steinbeck and Joyce. And like any good '80s punk act, you can tell he's \"anti-establishment.\" That means something a little more personal for him, though. The establishments he rejects are the everyday assumptions that tell us we need to do things a certain way. His live shows are more like audience-participation events than simple folk-art performances. We got an inside track on what kinds of unexpected things to expect from a guy who has no interest in meeting expectations:\n\nJK: The title of the album is \"Salvation in the Ground\" and that's a line from the first song \"Dirt to Dust\". What's the background on that song and how does it set up the album?\n\nAT: Actually, I wrote that song with my friend, Don Gallardo. Don't know if you've been to California recently, but when you drive up the I-5 you pass through the Central Valley, which is where Bakersfield is. It's where all the Okies moved during the Depression, like in The Grapes of Wrath. Well, there's been this terrible drought there for several years. The Central Valley is a strange area because some places are fertile and some are desert, so irrigation is a must. And some of the rivers were drying up so much because of the drought, that they had to cut off some of the water to the Central Valley. Because otherwise, all the smelt and salmon were in danger, and a much larger market of businesses and livelihoods would be impacted. So now you can drive through the Central Valley and you'll see signs that say \"Congress-created dustbowl. Blame Nancy Pelosi\" or \"Blame Schwarzenegger.\" Now it's become this political thing; for example, Sean Hannity would go down there every summer and get everyone riled up about it. I've really been intrigued by the whole thing, because there are all these people, and they moved to an area for life, and now it's gone, and almost nobody gives a damn about them or wants to do anything to fix it. People would rather spend all this time and money blaming someone for the problem, turning it into something political, and basically using these farmers for their own public relations.\n\nIt's sad, because as a society, we've come to the point where nobody wants to fix anything; it's become this revenge-based blame game. Whose fault is it, who can we sue? Like the recent shooting in Colorado, and immediately it's a gun-control issue. Twelve people died, and we're more interested in our political stances than that.\n\nJK: So is a critique of our society an important theme in the album?\n\nAT: Well, yes and no. It's not a Woody Guthrie, stick-it-to-the-man kind of thing; it's more about why don't we, as a race, worry more about loving one another than about trying to fight one another. So really, \"Dirt to Dust\" is just a love song. And the rest of the songs on the album are love songs too. That's the theme. I have one song that says: \"No one said love never-ending had any joy in its design.\" So I'm not saying it's not supposed to be easy, but it's what we need to be striving for.\n\nJK: Sounds like the songs are tied together.\n\nAT: Yeah, but I realize that nobody really listens to albums anymore, nobody sits down with the liner notes and listens for the 30-plus minutes it takes to get through it. But I still want to make an album like that. I used \"Dirt to Dust\" as the lead song so that the album goes through a progression of different aspects of the same theme. An album is like a short story collection. The parts stand on their own, but they say more when taken as a whole.\n\nJK: Why choose this genre\/sound? And is \"Americana\" the right name for it?\n\nAT: My relationship with \"Americana\" music is a funny thing. On the one hand, it came to me sort of organically; it sparks something that's been there with me a long time. When I was younger, I was doing this jam-band thing because some of the only music we had access to in my hometown was stuff that was either wildly popular on MTV and the radio or stuff that was classic, like The Allman Brothers or the Grateful Dead. But the other big influence on me was punk music. I was really into Black Flag and followed Ian MacKaye (Minor Threat). Unfortunately, the bands I was in were so bad that although we loved the Dead, we couldn't pull it off instrumentally. So of course the solution was to go for the opposite. Metal was really popular in my hometown.\n\nThen I remember going to see the Allman tour in '99 and Lucinda Williams opened. I just remember thinking, \"Oh, my God, yes\u2026this is amazing\u2026his is what I want to do.\" Of course the guys in my band at the time weren't quite as moved. But that music brought back all these memories from childhood of listening to Hank Williams and George Jones with my grandad. My parents broke up the same year Steve Earle's \"Guitar Town\" came out, so I had these memories of when my dad would have visitation with us, and he'd play that tape all the time. All those songs are about him and Justin (Townes Earle)'s mom breaking up, so it's a really personal thing to me.\n\nI realized that I was going to become a folk artist and began doing that sort of thing, just not very well. When I came to Nashville, I finally realized that I couldn't fall into the Nashville trap and let it be about popularity, about creating what someone else wanted to hear so that I could earn the title \"Americana.\" I started thinking about what I wanted to hear, what kind of music my friends want to make, wanted to play, what we wanted shows to be like. And as soon as I started having that attitude, we started selling out shows. And really that's what attracted me to the genre in the first place--it was a bunch of people who saw what the rest of Nashville was doing and thought, \"No, we're going to do this instead.\"\n\nJK: In that sense, a lot of what you're doing is about the band. You've said several times that this album is a collaboration.\n\nAT: Yes, the band that I play with are like family. We're very in-tune with each other and have a lot of love. Grayson and Clint and Joe and everybody, they're all a part of it. They're not just \"the band,\" or the \"people I make music with,\" we only become the whole thing when we're together and need each other to make it happen. It truly is a really beautiful thing.\n\nAllen Thompson lives in Nashville with his wife, Colleen, and a dog named \"Levon Helm.\" Follow him on Facebook and Twitter and be ready to get your hands on a copy of \"Salvation in the Ground.\" And finally, to quote Thompson himself, \"Take care and know that you are loved.\""}

{"text":"\"I'm not sure really. It's been about 3 years but, generally, most of that time was spent getting back into it (the studio). After 'Trouser Jazz', I was touring almost constantly; I had the weekly radio show, residencies, gigs and tours and stuff. It took a while, but I realised these kinds of 'extra things' were preventing me from making music at that time \u2013 and at some point I started thinking about getting back into the studio. There was new equipment, and getting my head 'round it all\u2026 I was still DJing \u2013 I love doing everything and don't like being secluded away for too long. I really enjoy being in the studio in the week & DJing at weekends.\" \"I had 30 or 40 finished tracks and 100's of unfinished ones, and I thought \"right, well if I've not nearly got an album in there, then maybe it's time to start thinking about doing something else!\" It was just when it felt right, it was instinct really, I wasn't gonna rush anything, it was just like,' right out try loads of stuff, see where my heads at, and then when the times right, cobble it together and make an album', and that's kinda what happened...\"\n\nQ I read that a lot of your stuff for this album was passed by in the clubs before you decided to lay it out in the studio\u2026\n\n\"Yeah, it's really nice to be able to road-test stuff, just basically because I was using a different studio, the room was a bit different, the acoustics and stuff, than I was used to. It's always good to do something in the studio, and think 'that sounds OK', and then test it, at night in the club, and see the response to it and then if it's cool then you leave it, if it needs a bit of a tweak, then you take it back in and test it out the next weekend. It's really ideal actually, I think it's a real luxury just being able to play stuff out, check it, and then by the time the album's come out, everything's been road tested.\"\n\nQ So 'Ninja Tuna' is not a concept album in any then way ?! It's a work in progress, a real-time thing?..\n\n\"Yeah, definitely. I think it's just really nice having the studio and then DJing at the weekends. They're both almost like pressure valves, and also kinda inspire and inform each other each as well, and when you test out studio stuff at the club, that's a very natural connection.\"\n\nQ You're using a new studio then?...or new equipment in your home studio?...\n\n\"Yeah, I've got the studio in my cellar, the weather over here's been so bad (UK!), for the last few years, we've not had a summer! So after my cellar flooded for the 2nd time, I thought I'm going to hack this off! (laughing) I'm going to use a studio in Manchester\u2026 It's really good actually, 'cause I'm not the kind of geekiest of studio people. Andy and Phil, who own the studio, it was really nice having them around just doing that stuff, teaching me how to use the equipment, they have a great selection of kit, and I think when there's more than more than one of you, you're much less likely to go off on a kinda self-indulgent tangent - and also it's fun. They know how to set all the mics up and all that kind of thing, so it's great, whilst I'm programming something, they can be setting the mic up and then we can be recording it, and you just get a lot more done a lot more quickly\u2026\" \"So it's a bit more of a new approach, but then you get to see other people's working practises and all that kinda informs the way you write and record as well\u2026 and the sounds really good as well, because it's not a great big studio, but the thing is, all the equipment they've got is really good quality.\"\n\nQ. Sound quality has always been really important to you..\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, definitely. Either with DJing or the studio, I think it's good to make a good quality recording and then use that as a basis. It's like if you're a DJ and you've got knackered styli, then the sounds gonna' be really bad, and if you don't know how to set up your mics in the studio, or you've accidentally distorted it or whatever, then you're just starting off with a shaky foundation really. I mean there's nothing wrong with deliberately recording stuff messed up; a lot of the funk bands are using really quite cheap mics, or people have a lot of hiss on the recordings, there's nothing wrong with that, I'm not saying that it has to be squeaky clean. I love recording stuff clean and then messing it up, to kinda of my specifications really.. yeah it's good, and if you're using a lot of elements in your tunes like I do, you've gotta make sure it's all recorded clearly so it doesn't sound like a big mess at the end of the day.\"\n\nQ So were the last 2 albums done pretty much solo then?..\n\n\"No I've always sort of worked with engineers, just generally for the stuff that I have difficulty with, you know like - certain aspects of mixing or recording live stuff, it's always good to have someone there who knows what they're doing\u2026 You know, if you've got a vocalist in the booth and they're asking for more reverb on their headphones, I'll spend 5mins doing that, whereas a good studio engineer would have it there in 2 seconds, and also I can be chatting to the vocalist while the other person is making sure that technically everything's OK.. it's just nice, and it's a bit of teamwork as well\u2026 and then I don't have to make my own tea all the time.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well Andy's a really good musician, fully trained, he's been playing since the age of 4, and properly studied music; he's a pianist, a vocalist, he's a good percussionist, he can get by on bass and that\u2026. He played the piano and the Hammond organ on that tune and Alice came in and we were all writing lyrics together, and all kinda chipping in. Andy was working a lot with the harmonies, which was pretty different to all the previous stuff to what Alice has done,.. a lot of Alice's harmonies have been pretty orthodox, goaspally, soulful and all that, and Andy took her into almost operatic territory, which she's perfectly capable of, it's just not something she had really done before\u2026I think that's one of the good things about a collaboration \u2013 is just going 'well, you don't have to do what you normally do', and that goes for both of us really, that's half the fun, it's pushing yourself a bit more, and going a little bit outside your comfort zone, but also having a lot fun at the same time.\"\n\nQ That's one of the things that shines through on the album, how much fun you have working with Alice ('music takes me up') & Will ('Quantic' Holland, 'donkey ride' track 3)...\n\n\"Absolutely, they're both really good friends, and I think when you're that comfortable with people; I mean I've never worked with Alice before, but we've spent so much time together and she always stays with us when she comes to Manchester. We're really good friends so that's a really good basis to start off on\u2026and when you're that close as friends anyway, then you don't feel bad.. I didn't feel bad about mentioning stuff to Alice about the way she was singing and stuff. You know, whereas if all I'd done is heard her records than I would have gone, 'Oh bloody hell, it's Alice Russell, I'm really nervous!' I might have bitten my tongue a bit more! It was really good fun, and it's nice when the vocalist starts chatting to you about the music, and you're like \"aw.. how bout singing it like this?..' I think once you're that relaxed that you start meddling in each other's, sort of, territories, then that's great fun. I don't get enough experience working with vocal melodies or writing lyrics, so when Alice was a bit stuck, you have to chip in and that's how you get experience.\"\n\nQ Roots Manuva collaboration ('nice up the function' track 6): having worked together before, was the process different this time? Did u it write for him?...\n\n\"Yeah, I did write something for him.. I mean he likes quite wonky beats and stuff. Just the way his flow is and his natural rhythm, and his turn of phrase, all lends itself to stuff that's a bit, sometimes almost falling apart, but he holds it together with his huge voice. It's one of those things, when you have in mind collaboration; it's one of those things you can think about too much.

How is that (label collaboration) giving you something different than you had before with Ninja Tune?\n\n\"Well, it's more just a way to, I suppose, bring together all the new stuff I'm doing. It's almost like a fresh start really, because I've not done stuff for so long, it was nice to combine things, obviously still with the cartoons and stuff, cause that works really well, and is kinda who I am, but I thought well, it's quite fun to have my own sort of, pretend mini-label, and also because I'm releasing so much stuff now; like I've got 3 singles out this year, I've got another single in November, there's another single in December, and there'll be another 2 singles before February, so pretty much every track on the album's coming out as a single. So I thought, if I'm being that productive after my sort-of studio hibernation, it makes sense to almost have my own sub-label on which to do that really, and the visual thing has always been a big part of my work anyway. It's the same again, it's just daft little idea\u2026as most of the things which I'm now associated with were.. (tea anyone?!). People say when they come to my gigs, or they hear my music, it's just daft little ideas that I wasn't really serious about at the time, and Ninja Tuna was one of them. It's my take on Ninja Tune, I suppose it's like a collaboration between me and the label, both in a literal sense, and in the name.\"\n\nQ. Will you be releasing other peoples' work, or is it just for you & Ninja Tune?\n\n\"I've no idea, absolutely no idea, but I love the fact that I don't have a clue! I think it's got the potential for other peoples stuff, I just need to get my own house in order before I start trying to be label manager or anything. It's good to have a bit of room for manoeuvre, and just see what happens, if someone hands me some amazing music you never know; but then I don't think I'm in a position where I could properly commit time, signing up people for who knows how long and stuff like that. That's pretty much getting into the full time job, and especially in this day and age, when you're extremely lucky to make any money out of music or sell any of it\u2026 Never say never, but it's nice to have the option.\"\n\nQ. You're coming to Australia?!\n\n\"Yes, I am, very excited actually! I think we're coming over just after Christmas, for 2 or 3 weeks, yeah, it's been a while (since the last visit).. and we're really looking forward to it!\n\n\"It's all still getting finalised, all our crew are getting really excited as well. Be good holidaying, we need some sun; we not had any over here for about a year really!! Flipppin 'eck, crazy!\"\n\nCan you imagine? Two years without a decent summer\u2026 and then hitting Oz in January to tour? We are all in for a little Scruff magic, old school, new school, Ninja Tuna-tastic.

{"text":"Terror Pigeon Dance Revolt\n\nSo your band's name is Terror Pigeon Dance Revolt. What's that all about?\n\nNeil Fridd: \"The truth is that I named the band when I was in high school many, many years ago. It didn't really take form or become a band until five years after that -- but the name came in high school. At the time, I was in this romantic debacle and I was caught up in that and it ended poorly and I was writing all these songs in my basement on this organ. And I started thinking of myself as this kind of weird version of the Phantom of the Opera, because the Phantom of the Opera hung out in the sewers and played organ. I was caught up over this lady so I thought of myself as that, but a s----y version that can't write songs. The Phantom of the Opera would go out and, like, cut down chandeliers and s---, he'd like f--- stuff up, whereas I was just sad. So that kind of transformed into the idea of a terrifying pigeon; pigeons being this creature that's totally incapable of inflicting any kind of harm on anyone. So the idea of being like an angry tough guy pigeon, that was the Terror Pigeon. I made music super-sporadically like that, just acoustic-like stuff. Then there was this definitive shift where I went 'I just want to make really fun dance music.' And at that point I just added Dance Revolt and here we are today four years after that.\"\n\nWhat actually made you go, \"Terror pigeons, yeah, that's badass\"?\n\n\"I don't know. It certainly wasn't ever a belief that it was badass. It's funny because when I think of a mascot for a terror pigeon, I don't think of a pigeon. I don't have any connection to a pigeon. Whenever I've thought of a mascot or what a terror pigeon is I think of an eagle wearing lots of gold chains. It's like an eagle that's dressed like 50 Cent. It's like this crazy, obnoxious life-controlling creature.\"\n\nSo what does the terrifying sound of revolutionary dancing pigeons actually sound like?\n\n\"You know when you meet a girl or a boy you like and you're pretty into them, and you're very unsure -- maybe there's circumstances like distance or maybe they might be seeing somebody or something -- so you're like, 'I don't know if this is going to work out.' So you have reservations and then maybe a month or two goes by and you're like, 'I'm still into this person,' and you hang out more and more and you're like, 'Oh no, they're into me. What's going to happen?' And then you totally make out with them. That's the sound we're going for.\""}

{"text":"\/\n\n\/\n\nFreak Scene: That Overlooked Destroyer Album\n\nThe above headline is not exactly true, but Destroyer's 2008 album Trouble in Dreams, which came on the heels of the universally loved Rubies, didn't get so much attention. I couldn't tell you why, necessarily. It wasn't bad by any means, but it does sort of tread water. Destroyer's Dan Bejar is known for switching things up pretty much every record, and Trouble in Dreams felt like a more compact version of Rubies.\n\nThe first time I heard it, I was wandering alone through Vancouver, Canada, where Bejar lives, on one of the wettest days I can remember. I remember hearing the opening lines of \"Blue Flower\/Blue Flame,\" Okay fine, even the sky looks like wine, and everywhere I turn there's a new face in time, stuck inside the well\u2026. The sky didn't look at all like wine just then. I was cold, and my socks were wet, but something about Bejar's lyrical concession\u2014like he had to just finally admit that looking up at the sky can be pretty beautiful despite whatever else might have been going on in his mind\u2014really hit home. Across the rest of the album there are all these weird, sticky lyrics that aren't actually very confessional, but through some combination of instrumental focus and vocal inflection, they come off as the realest Bejar ever got.\n\nSee the sun crawling over the sky, keep an eye on the surf and the sea and the sand, don't you know every night is a stand-off with the fucking horizon\u2026 from \"Rivers\"\n\nPretty much the entire album was Dan Bejar grappling with demons (personal or otherwise, it's hard to tell with him) through his relationship to the outside world. The sun and sky figure prominently\u2014as do city streets and plain statements about fucking up.\n\nIn an interview with Pitchfork around the release of Kaputt, which came out three years after Trouble in Dreams, Bejar spoke about his uneasiness about the songs on Trouble in Dreams:\n\n\"It was a feeling that started to creep into me\u2014that I was doomed if I was to persist. I know my last record, Trouble in Dreams, has my strongest lyric sheet. But I also know that, as a record, there's something off about it, which is fine. But I had trouble singing it in a lot of ways.\"\n\nWho even knows what that \"something off\" might be, but it's possible that it was Bejar at his most direct and honest, tapping into this idea of lost love and adult uncertainty in a way that was so obvious that it made him uncomfortable to revisit those songs. That's pure speculation on my part, but I think it's important to recognize that the album is his most unambitious\u2014less interested in playing with structure and genre tropes and more interested in crafting songs as just songs. It's the album equivalent of a short story. Unfussy and to the point."}
{"text":"I took Rainbow Danger Club's advice and listened to their new EP Into the Cellar exactly how they said I should: headphones, dark room, getting ready for the apocalypse (candles and snacks). But the truth is I would have enjoyed it no matter how I listened to it.\n\nIf you listened to RDC's previous album, 2011's Where Maps End, then you're already familiar with the sound of RDC, which definitely has carried over onto their most recent release. They aren't your typical indie-rock quartet. In fact, I find it hard to describe them since they seem to stand out not only on the Shanghai music scene, but in the larger music world as well. There are shades of well-known bands Arcade Fire, The National and The Decemberists in their music, plus the spacey, ethereal sounds heard from early Radiohead like OK Computer. But RDC isn't a copy of any of these bands\u2014they've taken influences from so many sources to create something else. The music onInto the Cellar is lush and progressive, using multiple instruments, arrangements, song orchestrations and sounds to create an EP that is best listened to as a whole rather than just a song here or there.\n\nEven thoughInto the Cellar is meant to be heard as a whole, that's not to say that there aren't notable, stand-alone songs on the album. In fact, the whole album is a blend of catchy, memorable songs mixed with instrumentals that move the album along. There's the singalong-worthy \"The Gathering of Fools,\" and \"Country Way,\" the latter of which exalts a simpler, computer-free life while cheekily using auto-tune and electronic percussion on the same track.\n\n\"Postcards from the Apocalypse\" is a surprisingly optimistic yet still hazy-sounding song that chronicles two people finding their way through a burned and desolate apocalyptic world. But then it's closely followed by the reflective \"Summer's End,\" a stripped-down, melancholic folk song. \"Summer's End\" blends effortlessly into \"Homemade Rockestship,\" a more buoyant song about building a rocket to space and exploring the universe.\n\nThe songs mix with each other, lyrically but also musically, buffered occasionally by lyric-less mood pieces that use a variety of instruments. In addition to the standard guitar\/drums\/keyboard setup of most indie-rock bands, RDC also uses the ukulele, cello (most notably on \"The Gathering of Fools\"), organ, and harmonica (for a beautiful addition to \"Country Way\"), plus a pretty creative use of whistling. The trumpet is still featured heavily as well.\n\nIf their last album was about a sea journey to the ends of the Earth, this one is most aptly about the beginnings of a space journey to the ends of the galaxy. There are even recycled refrains at the beginning of this album that came from their last, making me believe that RDC is thinking of their music being connected on a whole other scale most bands don't. The album ends with four instrumental pieces (\"Journey to the Gates of Atlantis I, II, III, and IV\") that build and build and then end\u2026nowhere. It feels unfinished, which is what I imagine it's supposed to feel like.\n\nThis album isn't at all an EP as it contains twelve full songs and comes in at just under fifty-two minutes. It does feel like it's meant to be part of a larger work, though, but whether all these songs will survive to be released on a new album next year remains to be seen. RDC must have a wealth of material if this is just a \"sampling\" of what we can expect, and the songs on this album display a strong sense of musicianship as well as exceptional songwriting. It's well worth getting this album now (very, very much worth it) fromRainbow Danger Club's Bandcamp page"}

{"text":"Album Review: Ellie Goulding \u2013 Halcyon\n\nBritish indie\/electronica pop is back with Ellie Goulding's new release. The first standout track comes from \"My Blood\" which features tribal elements, soaring vocals and melodic riffs. \"Only You\" gives the ballad electronica songs a break, pumping up the piano and giving the record more of a straight pop-soul feel. The title track is an inspirational one that's airy and uplifting.\n\n\"Figure 8\u2033 fits perfectly as a college party song and would lend itself well to radio. \"Hanging On\" is like a contrast between darkness and light, the falsetto vocals of Ellie contrasting with the heaviness of the beat. The ballad \"Explosions\" is the most straight-forward of all the songs; simplistic with harmonies and instrumentation fitting of a movie soundtrack. \"Atlantis\" starts off small and then blooms in the chorus with synths and chants. \"Dead in the Water\", a song that seems to be floating, helps to close the album before a \"Hanging On\" remix that serves as a sort of reprise.\n\nEllie describes the album as \"a journey from dark into light\". It's an accurate description, as not only does the singing get lighter but the music behind it as well as the album progresses. The LP is classified as dream pop and it should be.

{"text":"Hot Categories\n\nAndy Kim has lived a life steeped in songwriting. The expat Montrealer began his career in New York in the 1960s, penning hits like 'Sugar, Sugar' and 'Rock Me Gently.' Since then, he's sustained a career that led him to Toronto, where hometown artists like Ed Robertson of Barenaked Ladies, Broken Social Scene and Ron Sexsmith have embraced his songwriting skills. His newest record, 'I Forgot To Mention,' features a band that includes Iggy Pop bassist and producer Hal Kagan and Lou Reed's longtime drummer Bob Medici. The record succeeds at both sustaining and updating Kim's melodic, melancholic sound. Spinner caught up with Kim as he was set to rehearse for an upcoming NXNE spot.\n\nHow did you approach the making of 'I Forgot To Mention?'\n\nI'm really a fan of music. I've always been interested in what's going out there. I went out to the studio with the purpose of just having a band and cutting it live, doing the vocals as live as possible. I'm really excited that we kind of captured something, and I'm hoping whatever it is we captured, people can relate to.\n\nCan you tell me a little bit about your beginnings?\n\nI never really thought about it. All I knew was that for the environment I lived in, the family I grew up with, the music that was played came from a faraway land, the US. I'm sure the Beatles felt the same way, whether it was listening to Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers or Elvis or any of their influences. I think my environment was shaped by what my older brothers played and what I was able to hear on WKBW and WABC in New York, late at night.\n\nJust all the great sounds and all the great music. Early on I became excited about the sounds of all the majestic productions of Phil Spector and the songwriters of the Brill Building, who I am very honoured to have learned so much from. I was influenced not so much by my immediate surroundings, but by the dream from another planet, which was rock and roll of the late '60s and '70s. It's always been a wonderful feeling to eventually meet people like Roy Orbison, and to meet John Lennon -- who gave me my first gold record -- and being part of the Brill Building heritage.\n\nTo me that really kind of signifies what is important to me, and that is songwriting, and songs and songwriters. That's basically who I am in a nutshell.\n\nHow did you get the courage to leave Montreal as a teen and go it alone in New York?\n\nWhen you're a teenager, the world is yours and nobody knows what you're going through, basically. You don't listen to advice. I just had this burning desire ever since I was 12 years-old to do this, and I just found a way to do this. As an adult, one looks back and says, \"Oh my god, we were so young.\" Well the truth is when you're a teenager, you're immortal. You can do what you want to do and nothing is going to go wrong. There's a certain bravado that a teenager has, and it's not based on experience, so basically ignorance is bliss at that point.\n\nI was fortunate enough that I was taller than most teenagers in the neighbourhood, I was really so strong in my belief. The belief was only in my head, but it was real to me. I had relatives that lived an hour and a half away from New York, so if I got into any problems [I could call them]. My mom and dad made me call them collect every 15 minutes.\n\nWhat is your particular songwriting method?\n\nI come from the belief that you can't teach songwriting. You can teach a craft, and you can hear the craft if it's only craft, but if I can paraphrase Sir Paul McCartney when he was asked how he and John wrote all those great songs, he said \"I don't know, it was just magic.\" The truth is that's how it starts. You're inspired to write something or sing something or come up with a lyric, but the craft doesn't start yet -- the ability and the feeling that you've heard something that you hold onto and say \"I think I've got something, I don't know what it is but I think I got something.\" That to me is the important part of knowing what you have. Songs represent your take on life, your take on something you've been inspired by.\n\nYou don't like the word 'bubblegum', do you?\n\nWell, y'know, first of all, that's a derogatory term, especially in 1969. ['Sugar, Sugar'] turned out to be the song of the year and the record of the year. It turned out to be a song that Ike and Tina [Turner] recorded and Bob Marley recorded. So if you're looking at the song, the song was written for a Saturday morning television show. I thought I was writing 'She Loves You Yeah Yeah Yeah,' because if you look at 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' and 'She Loves You Yeah Yeah Yeah' and 'Teddy Bear' and 'All Shook Up,' those songs [line up] with 'Sugar, Sugar.' Those are songs that make you feel a certain way. They weren't written for any other purpose than how the songwriter was feeling. I think with 'Sugar, Sugar' -- who knew it would become this iconic song? In 1969, the year of Woodstock and the Vietnam war, to have a song that hearkened back to the early 1960s in spirit was maybe not expected.\n\nMaybe it was healthy.\n\nYes. It's an interesting thing when you sell millions and millions and millions of records around the world -- that means that these people have actually gone and purchased something that they want to be a part of and take home and play as many times as they can play. And then someone decided, \"Well, it's uncool\" -- that's a little bit of an absurd thought to me.\n\nWhat music inspires you at the moment?\n\nAnyone who wants to be inspired, who loves what music can do to you, go out and get the new Broken Social Scene. It's just brilliant. I do this charity Christmas show every year at the Mod Club in Toronto, and the guys were there this year and kinda previewed one of their songs. I just stood there with my mouth open. You can hear the inspiration. You marvel at the craft, but it's the inspiration that gets me in awe.\n\nAndy Kim plays"}

{"text":"3 posts categorized \"The Kills\"\n\nApril 04, 2011\n\nThe Kills write simple songs with lots of attitude, the kind that blows smoke in your face and stubs out cigarettes in your chest. Dirt, sleaze, swagger \u2013 the duo delivered on three studio albums between 2003 and '08 blending blues grind, drum-machine beats and spectral vocals that sounded like a visitation from Sister Midnight.\n\nOn \"Blood Pressures\" (Domino), the fourth studio album from singer Alison Mosshart and guitarist Jamie Hince, the duo adds a few twists to the formula. Mosshart, who moonlighted recently in Jack White's Dead Weather, is a more versatile singer than ever. She puts a touch of Peggy Lee smolder into \"The Heart is a Beating Drum,\" and does a pretty good impression of a torch singer on \"The Last Goodbye,\" pouring out her world-weariness over a wan piano. Even Hince gets into the spirit of boundary-pushing with his lead-vocal turn on a wobbly psychedelic ballad, \"Wild Charms.\"\n\nOtherwise, it's the Kills putting more of a pop gleam on their guitar-drums grime. The melodies are more pronounced, the lyrics more carefully enunciated. \"Baby Says\" tries to have it both ways, a straight-up, almost pretty pop song underpinned by a guitar that sounds like it was recorded on a defective cassette tape. But the tamer approach isn't entirely successful and the album runs out of steam in its second half. It leaves \"Blood Pressures\" sounding like a more polite version of the Kills"}

As singer\/guitarist Jacob Danish Sloan tells Spinner, the track was part of a multi-band project and blends both happiness and heartache in its music and words.\n\n\"The song 'El Lissitzky' was conceived for a project in which a bunch of bands each wrote a song inspired by a famous painter of their choice,\" Sloan says. \"It's about confusion, balancing creativity and love, and a classic combination: upbeat music and melancholy lyrics.\""}
{"text":"Nihiti, \"Other People's Memories\" LP\n\nNihiti is a fairly shadowy New York City-based group that has already started to bubble-up on the blogosphere. Head over to their website and you'll see that they definitely try to cult-ivate a certain aura of mystery with Worship, Emanation, and Prophecy linkages leading you into their world where \"Aleister Crowley Becomes The Quietude In The Light\" is a generated foretelling of the future. Once you get past these sigh-inducing factors, though, it's pretty easy to get caught up in what Nihiti have created on Other People's Memories, their first full-length offering.\n\nFor the most part, Nihiti deal in dark and moody instrumental pieces that flow into one another in an almost suite-like fashion. There is a bit of a split personality that plays out over the course of the album, with the A-side focused mostly on organic, piano-driven instrumentation and the flip side on more electronic, dance-oriented methods. Within each side, the sounds vary widely as well. For example, the A-side moves from dark pop (\"No Angel Came\") to ominous bossa nova (\"Party Of\") to more dance-leaning textures (\"The Return of Kind Ropes (Laku Noc, Dusan K)\"). When vocals do factor in, as on \"The Ringing In (The Sun is Rung),\" Nihiti sound a smidge like T.V. On The Radio with a bit more urgency. You can hear some of the same group dynamics over the course of the B-Side, but with noticeable post-production tinkering that you'd swear James Murphy may have lent a hand to.\n\nThere's a certain polish to Other People's Memories that I'm normally quite averse to, but I can appreciate how fully realized this album is, which nowadays isn't something you can say for most band's first full-lengths."}

It's a good indication of what's to come. Over the course of a dozen songs, frontman Ari Picker tries to make sense of his mother's suicide against a backdrop of rich orchestration, piled generously atop a base of delicate acoustic folk like heaping spoonfuls of vanilla frosting. Given the subject matter, it's no surprise that the mood is grim; buried deep within the swirling layers of strings, Picker's desperate falsetto sounds like a boy crying for help from within a blizzard. The result is songs suited less for a rock club than a church sanctuary, with Picker playing the forlorn choirboy"}
{"text":"Dear You is more than a personal letterhead. They're a straight-edge rock band from Texas, tweeting their hearts out and impaling themselves on their instruments.\n\nWhat I like most about them is how legit they are. Not only in their performance, but in their lyrical content. They don't put on airs or inflate their egos, but allow themselves to be accessible, relatable. Whether they're making killer covers (check out their rendition of Raise Your Glass to see what I mean) or spouting off original compositions, they're emotionally charged but still tons of fun.\n\nWhen you watch their videos, you can see that they love what they do. There are no vibes of tension, competition or foolish pride. They are down to earth and full of nothing but awesome.\n\nI must admit I'm acutely attuned to their break-up anthem The Way That You Left Me. They play it safe but do it well."}
{"text":"For Once in My Life, I'll Be Spontaneous: an EHS record review\n\nSo here's the thing that bugs me about Tucson, Arizona's \u2026music video?: as a grammatical perfectionist, I hate the way the band's name makes my sentences look. No, I'm not asking a question there. No, I'm not trailing into a thought. That's just how the dude formats it. And as an iTunes perfectionist, I hate the way the band's name is sorted in my library. The program knows enough to alphabetize it starting with the 'm,' so it falls correctly between Mull Historical Society and My Bloody Valentine. But it doesn't know enough to jump directly to it when I type 'mus.' And it won't let me find it quickly by typing in an ellipsis, either.\n\nTurns out those are about the only two things that bug me about \u2026music video?. Turns out, in fact, that I'm totally addicted to the new album from Paul Jenkins's one-man pop\/indie\/electronica\/rock band.\n\nSee, the album does this thing where it starts out all mysterious, with the hiss and whine of an off-the-air TV station (on the intro track \"Ellipsis\"; the album's ethereal outro track is called \"Question Mark.\" Get it?). Suddenly kicks in this big, heavy Amusement Parks on Fire-esque guitar riff and liberal stabs at a simulated crash cymbal, like some looming dark night-time anthem. When it cuts down to the album's first verse, though, you hear a better example of the trademark \u2026mv? sound: glitchy programmed drums, Jenkins's low, warm, voice, free from any audible effect, and a sparkling plucked electric guitar line. When the chorus falls back down\u2013that warm dark guitar riff that started everything\u2013it sounds like some strange Smashing Pumpkins-turn-shoegaze movement, sans Billy Corgan's occasionally-tolerable whine.\n\n\"Another Random Tragedy\" sounds a bit like The Flaming Lips\u2013mostly in Jenkins's voice\u2013but holds onto that distinct \u2026mv? sound that you'll get to know if you listen to even a few tracks; there's another glitchy beat underneath, a post-rock-style single-string guitar line in the background, and a little breakdown that sounds exactly like your laptop, your cellphone, and your microwave are all flirting with each other in some kind of electronic bizarre love triangle. \"The Little Boy on Fire\" is equally Flaming Lips-inspired, and possibly one of the most straightforward tracks on the record, featuring mostly piano and synth sounds, with a super catchy syncopated beat that helps buoy the mournful piano chords and woeful chorus.\n\nThe album also stalks through a couple darkly playful tracks with Gotham-like musical landscapes. \"For the Sake of Argument I Disagree\" rides a grinding fuzzy bassline through its choruses with Jenkins weaving a tale of jealousy and regret through Elliott Smith-like whispers and bent blue notes. Its chorus is unexpectedly pretty, with a glittery harpish Nintendo-style synth line. \"Seasick\"\u2013devious- and clever-sounding, pulsing with a distorted drum beat and a theremin-like synth line\u2013could pass as a song in an imaginary Tim Burton film.\n\n\"Sugar Ghost\" comes off like some lost post-rock tune rocketed into the future, with its chiming falling guitar line and heady, stuttering drums. Jenkins's vocals gently push and then tear into the middle of the tune, carrying a romantically desperate wail-turned-impressive-falsetto (Glen Hansard-style) into a crushing tide made up of a mighty rising guitar riff and smashing drums. \"Sparklemilk Warning\" is equally emotive and equally fragile-yet-powerful, with crashing cymbals, a ghostly falsetto, and twirling organ lines that anyone who ever dug Volcano I'm Still Excited!! will admire. Both songs are impossible to imagine as anything but stunning at a live \u2026mv? performance.\n\nThe album's central tracks, though, happen to be my favorite. \"House of Cards\" is from the movie from the future, somehow blending an old-school-drum 'n' bass beat with a cool wave of electronic noise, an ocean of digital breath washing through the song's chorus, with little electronic twitters and blip-buoys. Jenkins manages to create some extremely interesting sounds on this record; I find myself drawn back to the record just as much by these weird little noises as by its tight hooks and big soaring choruses. \"Shipwrec\" somehow makes musical the sound of futuristic vacuum cleaners or your computer's hard drive spinning, and it's strangely addictive and peaceful to let those sounds swirl around on either side of your head. It's one of those beautiful night-time songs that can make you feel wistful and hopeful and melancholy and content all at the same time.\n\nAnd then there's \"The Day I Exploded,\" the album's brightest candidate for ambassador to indie radio. The song begins with the sound of blowing wind and a rich layer of twittering glitch-cricket clicks and then gallops quickly into a shiny busy verse and explodes into a triumphant, confident chorus. There also appears in the middle of the song a little lush glitchpop garden that would sound at home on a Seal Beach EP-era Album Leaf recording. But suddenly there's that triumphant guitar riff again!\n\nJenkins's vocal delivery is strong throughout the album, and the lyrics sound generally sincere, if not very poetic. There is the occasional awkward line (as on \"The Little Boy on Fire,\" where can be found a line about \"reindeer games\"; I understand it's a reference to the old Christmas standard and all, but I can't help thinking about that terrible Ben Affleck movie). But it's Jenkins's sincerity that sells you. Or that sold me. When, on the just-mentioned \"The Day I Exploded,\" Jenkins sing-shouts about how he'll \"keep it in a safe place,\" I believe him, and then when I'm further assured that \"you'll be able to find it whenever you need it,\" I wish the \"you\" referred to me because I would love to have that kind of peace of mind.\n\nSo is this a lyrical album? It is. You can hear what he's saying. There's nothing cringe-worthy. The stories are human, sympathetic, sometimes a little quirky and weird, and interesting (my favorite of them being \"House of Cards,\" about a vaguely romantic companion who happens to be small enough to fit in a pocket). But ultimately this is a sound album, and I find myself listening (on repeat) for all those strange little engineered noises swimming around under or above the clever and well-made pop tunes.\n\nSadly, you're not likely to catch a \u2026music video? show in Denver anytime soon. Jenkins seems to be in that stage in a musician's career where he makes music simply for the joy of making music and letting people hear it. Not much chance of a cross-country tour. He's without a record label, a manager, or a booking agent (although he wouldn't mind having any of those on board, according to the \u2026mv? MySpace page). But if you find yourself in Tucson in time for one of his shows, you're likely in for a smashing (and beautifully weird) performance. Would I be a total asshole if I added \"And if you make it to a \u2026music video? show, tell 'im EHS sent ya!\"?"}

{"text":"A curious video popped up in the last 24 hours: a personal trainer enthusiastically preaching the virtues of working out while on tour. His trainees? Justin Vernon and the rest of the Bon Iver gang. At first it seems like you're watching a fake infomercial, but as it continues the footage feels genuine, or at least goes on way to long without a punchline. Turns out \"Bon Iver workout DVD\" is indeed a thing. A little bit of digging reveals that the forthcoming DVD was directed by Dan Huiting, who helmed the official Bon Iver videos for \"Calgary\" and the deluxe version of \"Holocene,\" beautifully shot pieces that accompany two of Bon Iver's more revered songs from Bon Iver.\n\nHive phoned up Huiting, who talked to us about filming the DVD, how the workouts are structured and when the video will hit shelves.\n\nWhat exactly is this workout video?\n\nIt's a legit workout DVD. Straight up, for real. [It's] 45, 50 minutes. Literally, you can work out to it and have music from all the bands we like: Bon Iver, S. Carey, Megafaun, We are the Willows and a couple others that escape me. It's like a workout mixtape. You can workout to cool music instead of something stupid.\n\nYou don't really think of music like this as being optimal to workout to.\n\nIf you're an indie rock kid and you put that music on while you're running on the treadmill, this is an actual circuit. There's a weight circuit, a body circuit and an ab circuit. Each are about 15 minutes. So basically, it's three parts and there are three or four songs on each part. It's in Justin's yard, where he grew up, and it's them doing these three circuit exercises. There's a dictionary where one person demonstrates a particular move that they're doing. It's legit. You can turn off the commentary if you just want to listen to the music.\n\nOne of the most interesting parts of the trailer is the band working out backstage. Are there a lot of scenes like that, or are they more instructional?\n\nIt's a workout video. I'm in the middle of a feature film about Bon Iver \u2013 a feature-length documentary. So, I follow him pretty much everywhere. I pulled the footage from that because we needed to make a little promo thing.\n\nDo you get weird looks for doing lunges backstage ?\n\nNobody's there. It's just them, maybe a staff person. For the most part, people are into these guys taking being healthy so seriously. Obviously, I can see how people will think this is a big joke; Hipster Runoff made a joke about it. And technically, it's different than what you expect. But the dudes are dead serious about their health. Excercise is informing all of his other stuff, including his music. I toured with them for a month this summer and it's not like a heavy party situation. Their catering is healthy food, their rider is healthy food. They put an effort into keeping in shape on the road, unlike myself.\n\nIs there a routine they set forth? Excercise and working out usually has an order to it.\n\nIt seems like each day they'd pick one of the circuits. They'd do one one day, one the other day. That's what all that footage is \u2026 of them doing that.\n\nIs there a time table for release?\n\nCouldn't tell you, man. I'm imagining \u2026 fuck if I know. Soon-ish. How's that sound? It's done, it's color corrected, so I guess when they get back from tour. Month or two, maybe?"}
{"text":"No related\n\nThe legend of Scottish band Belle And Sebastian began with a college course designed to help students prepare for a music career through hands-on experience. Glasgow's Stow College released one record a year through a music-business course, and Belle And Sebastian served as one of its guinea pigs. Over the course of less than a week in 1996, the group recorded Tigermilk, its now-beloved debut. Only 1,000 vinyl copies were made, and the original pressings remain sought-after collector's items, even though a CD version came out 1999. Later in '96, the band followed Tigermilk with If You're Feeling Sinister, a transcendent collection of literate, witty, sophisticated, and exquisitely sad pop songs that won the group an intensely devoted international following. After that album came a series of EPs, and eventually The Boy With The Arab Strap, the enigmatically titled Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like A Peasant, and then the soundtrack to Todd Solondz's controversial Storytelling. For Belle And Sebastian's latest album, the ambitiously genre-hopping Dear Catastrophe Waitress (due out Oct. 7), the group enlisted producer Trevor Horn, who has worked with everyone from ABC to Cher to Barry Manilow to Malcolm McLaren. The Onion A.V. Club recently spoke with Stuart Murdoch, Belle And Sebastian's primary singer and songwriter, about touring, publicity, songwriting, and the group's early days.\n\nThe Onion: A lot of Belle And Sebastian's songs deal with the emotions of childhood and adolescence. What was your own childhood like?\n\nStuart Murdoch: Run of the mill. I think it was pretty much the same as everybody else's.\n\nO: What were you interested in as a kid?\n\nSM: Football. AC\/DC. It depends on what age I was. I'm sure I followed whatever the fad of the day was.\n\nO: What led you to become interested in music?\n\nSM: Well, my parents made me take piano lessons. It's the sort of thing that you get used to in childhood that you hate, but then you used to hate a lot of things. Now, I appreciate it vastly. I had a little group when I was about 11 or 12. It's actually quite funny, because if you see a picture of the group now, it pretty much looks like Belle And Sebastian. It's almost the same lineup, only there's more girls. It's the same kind of mixture. There were like four girls, two guys, two guitarists, a piano player\u2013I was the piano player. It was pretty much set.\n\nO: When you were in a group then, did you think about playing music professionally as an adult?\n\nSM: Not really. When I was 11 or 12, I wanted to be an airline pilot. I went to get my eyes examined, and they tested me for colorblindness. It seems like kind of a trivial thing to happen, but they show you all these sheets with letters and numbers. It's kind of bizarre. But you have to pick out what number you see on the page, and either you see a number or you see nothing at all. I picked out nothing at all. The lady said to me, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" I said a pilot, and she said, \"Well, you'll never do that.\" It was kind of cruel. It would be poetic for me to say that at that moment I decided to be a rock star, but it's not true.\n\nO: What made you want to be an airline pilot?\n\nSM: It's the kind of random job when you're that age. You never really seem to get beyond being a fireman or a policeman or an airline pilot, that sort of thing. One of the three. Actually, I don't like flying, so now it seems kind of funny to me. It would be one of my least favorite jobs now. Still, I would much rather be flying the plane than the steward. I mean, if I'm going to die, I'd rather have a hand in my own death.\n\nO: How do you feel about the flying aspect of touring?\n\nSM: It's just something you have to get through. It's actually improved recently. Valium helps.\n\nO: What led to the formation of Belle And Sebastian?\n\nSM: I started writing tunes, and songs started coming to me around the end of '92, the beginning of '93. By '95, I was looking for musicians to form a group, but not sure of what I wanted. I was in a kind of half-assed music course, and I was recording demos and songwriting. That's where I met Stuart David, our [former] bass player. I said to myself that by Christmas '95, if I couldn't get a gig together, then I'd go to San Francisco, because I'd been there. Just at that point, some people involved with the course got in touch with me and said they'd heard a demo and wanted to help make the album that became Tigermilk.\n\nO: What was the recording process like? You did it in a week?\n\nSM: Five days. It was very well-planned. It had to be. The setup was that the college took a band a year and made a record. They were like a dummy record company, and they ran a music course so that students could get experience with working for a record company. We were the dummy band. Usually, they put out a single by the band, but we went to the proprietor of the course and explained how much money and time we had. I thought, \"In that time, I'm sure we could make an album.\" I wrote the tracks then and there, and we planned it really well. One of the tracks was already pretty much recorded. It was simple, because it was recorded live and based on me playing the acoustic guitar. All the arrangements were worked out for piano, violin, and trumpet.\n\nO: Do you think recording it so quickly benefited Tigermilk?\n\nSM: Yes, absolutely. There couldn't have been any other way. It was energetic and concise. I remember hearing the first three tracks after just a couple of days, and my adrenaline was going, because I couldn't believe it sounded so good.\n\nO: When did you realize that Tigermilk would take off the way it did?\n\nSM: It's funny, you know, because it became a so-called underground classic and something to get, but that didn't happen for ages. I remember taking the records around to the shops to sell. We only made a thousand vinyl copies. We gave away about 400 of the things; the college sent out 400 copies as part of the unit. They had to act like a record company, so they sent copies out to other record companies, and to people in the music business. We only had 600 to sell, and I remember trying to sell the things, and people telling me to slog off. We had a launch party where we tried to give the records away. I had never wanted that goofy old \"Tigermilk is hard to get\" thing, especially since I remember when we took a copy 'round to the local record shop, and it sat there in the window for the entire summer. I got embarrassed. I was like, \"My God, we can't even sell a thousand records. We can't even sell 600 records, and there's a copy in the record-store window whose sleeve is getting lighter and lighter.\" Its legendary status didn't come until much later.\n\nO: You didn't begin writing songs until relatively late in your life. What was the catalyst?\n\nSM: I don't know if it was the catalyst, but quite frankly, the biggest thing that's ever happened in my life was I got sick at the end of the '80s. I was sick for about seven years. That was a big desert at the time, a kind of vacuum in my life. From that, these songs started coming out, these melodies where I could express what I was feeling.\n\nO: How much of your songwriting is autobiographical?\n\nSM: I just got this image in my mind of a cake, of writing songs being like baking a cake. The autobiographical part of things is like the flour, and the romance side of things and the fantasy part are like the sugar and eggs. By the time you're done mixing it all together, it's hard to tell which is which. When you write a song, it just comes out. There'll be little strands of it, and some are of biography, and some are things that have happened or that you think about.\n\nO: Do you find it easier to write songs from your own point of view, or from the viewpoint of a character?\n\nSM: It's funny: I think I used to find it easier to write from the point of view of a character, and the only reason I think that is because I used to write a lot of songs from that perspective. Now, I think it's probably easier to write songs from an \"I\" perspective. Then again, maybe it's just a writer's conceit that the \"I\" they're writing from is actually them.\n\nO: Early in your career, Belle And Sebastian was famous for being reluctant to do interviews or photo shoots. What was the impetus behind that?\n\nSM: It was just sort of the circumstances. It's not really any kind of fascinating thing. It just seemed easier not to do press. It's one of those situations where music was important to us, and writing was important, arranging was important, practicing was important, as was playing gigs. When you've got a new band, you spend a lot of time trying to keep it together. It was a very large band, and things were all happening at once. It took a lot for the older members of the band to protect the younger members, to reassure them that songs would always have the upper hand. It seemed like the last thing we wanted to do was tell the world about it. It was all about trying to keep the family together. It was a dysfunctional band, and if I had a dysfunctional family, the last thing I'd want to do is go on Oprah and talk about it.\n\nO: When Belle And Sebastian started to take off in the U.S., the group seemed enigmatic. Do you think that added to its appeal?\n\nSM: You'd have to tell me, because I was on the inside, trying to hold things together and holding down a job on the side. I didn't really know too much about how people on the other side of the world think.\n\nO: What was your job at that point?\n\nSM: I was a caretaker at a church. It's still a part of my life, in that I made a lot of friends there, though I don't work there anymore. I was in charge of a lot of things. I did enjoy it.\n\nO: Trevor Horn produced the new album. What led you to hire him?\n\nSM: Well, he approached us. I don't know, it's all a bit vague. It just seemed to kind of happen. We were looking for a producer. I didn't want to do another record without a producer. A few names were kicked about, but with the other two people, the timing was bad. With him, it just seemed like good timing.\n\nO: How do you think having him as a producer affected the way the album was made?\n\nSM: It was just a lot more concentrated, having him and his organization. We were able to concentrate more on things that are meant to be concentrated on: playing, singing, arranging, and writing, rather than the production side.\n\nO: Did he have a lot of amusing stories about the groups he'd worked with?\n\nSM: He did. He kept us amused through many a spring and summer night with stories about Frankie Goes To Hollywood and ABC and Yes.\n\nO: In an interview, you said you were living halfway between the '60s and the '70s. What did you mean by that?\n\nSM: I don't remember saying that, but I think more and more that I'm a throwback, and that the band is a throwback. I think it's interesting how the stylings of the '60s and '70s and even the '80s can kind of set you off, how you mourn the passing of each decade and all the things that just aren't done these days.\n\nO: One of the songs on Dear Catastrophe Waitress contains the line \"If I could do just one near-perfect thing, I'd be happy.\" Do you feel like you've approached that kind of perfection in your career?\n\nSM: That was an old song from well before this album, but I think the closest we've probably come was with Tigermilk. There was a purity to that that'd be difficult to recapture. Since then, I'd have to say \"Jonathan David,\" the single.\n\nO: How do you think the departure of [bassist and singer] Stuart David has affected the band?\n\nSM: I think it's been good for the band. In my mind, him and Isobel [Campbell, cellist and singer] left at the same time, and I think it helped the group. I think it's made things more focused. They'd probably say the same thing.\n\nO:A Hard Day's Night is on the list of your favorite films. If someone were to make a film about a day in the life of Belle And Sebastian, what would it be like?\n\nSM: I think it'd be really boring. I'm not sure anybody would want to see it. It'd be a lot of us sitting around talking.\n\nO: Would there be scenes of you being chased through the streets by your fans?\n\nSM: I think it'd be just the opposite. We'd be chasing our fans through the streets."}

{"text":"Review: C V L T S - Realiser\n\nEveryone who has some experience with reviewing music knows that is takes different number of listens for various albums to sink in, in order to develop thoughts, conclusions and ideas related to each release. While some albums can click after one-two listens, some might need several repeated listens, sometimes clocking in dozens. \"Realiser\", the newest album by American (Kansas, to be more exact) surf drone duo C V L T S, belongs in the latter category. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a \"difficult\" or \"challenging\" album, it's just the inconsistency and differing quality of songs (or tracks, if you will), that makes it so darn hard to review.\n\nJust like the artwork, featuring an interesting, but none the less overall featureless satellite photo of some stretch of land that might be anywhere on Earth (or even on another planet), the tracks seem rather bland and featureless at first. Some standard \"psychedelic\" synth noodlings here and there, occasionally interrupted with a more energetic, more instrumental track. That's the problem with \"Realiser\" - it never really seems to \"take off\". While the opening \"Realiser\" might be considered an electronic intro to a pretty rocking, guitar and drum driven \"Brahma Weapons\" (which is the highlight of the album, definitely), after the second track the album seems to fall into a miasmatic, somewhat confusing maze of droning synth tracks that tend to blend into one another and offer no clear direction. The tracks fade in and out, offering rather enjoyable, but overall forgettable droning noodles. There's a bit of lo-fi hypnagogia looming all over their music, and there's some New Age heritage to be found here.\n\nThat's the main problem with \"Realiser\" - it gives a few false starts and a few treats - like the really groovy, head-bobbing krautrocky jam of \"Brahma Weapons\", but most of the other tracks lack much substance. Most of them are just murky, somewhat \"trippy\" lo-fi improvisations based more or less on tired drones. It's almost as if they managed to make a track interesting for several seconds (starting with a scrap of interesting melody or some semblance of a rhythm), but getting bored after that time and just let the track develop \"somehow\", without much idea about what to do with it. In summary, \"Realiser\" seems like a collection of failed ideas, that probably have some potential hidden deep within, yet lack clear vision of how they should be developed. This being said, \"Brahma Weapons\" is a banger and I really hope those two will head in direction of synth-laden psych rock jams, or at least infuse their electronic tracks with more structure and cohesion."}
{"text":"Gomez likes to have a good time all the time\n\n\"A lot of it's to do with really simple things, like the range of the song, what key it's in, what fits best...the rhythm of the song,\" Ottewell says. \"Ian's a lot better rhythmic singer than I am, so with songs like that, I just let Ian sing it. But that's not always the case. Sometimes you have to go with what sounds best.\"\n\n\"What sounds best\" seems to be a point of contention between critics on both sides of the pond.

Seriously. Not making fun, just saying.\n\nMore About\n\n\"There's a bit of ill feeling toward this album in the British press, but nothing really savage yet, so that's good,\" Ottewell says. In fact, the biggest criticism of Gomez so far is that its music is the emotional equivalent of junk food: There's nothing of real substance for sentimental types to chew on. Indeed, with songs like \"Whipping Piccadilly\" (about going to a Beck concert and whacking a shoelace against the Piccadilly train-station sign), \"Tijuana Lady\" (with its nonsensical lyrics like \"enchilada desperado days\") and \"Ruff Stuff\" (\"Come back\/I've been hangin' around in smack bogs, baby\"), Gomez isn't exactly exploring the same territory as its tear-soaked countrymen Radiohead and Starsailor. But the criticisms don't bother the band much.\n\n\"We don't really listen to [the critics]. It's not going to change who we are or how we make music,\" Ottewell says. Besides, the boys have greater challenges to face. \"Getting over hangovers rates pretty high. And football matches within the band. A member of our crew broke my toe in a challenge.\""}
{"text":"Sound Takes: Lateral Desert Shifts\n\nI recently heard someone on NPR use the term \"desert noir\" to describe the band Calexico. Having never heard the term before, I immediately took to it. I liked the juxtaposition of the words, the barren visual connotation of the desert with the lush, velvety danger of noir. It seemed like an accurate way to describe the feeling of a desert highway's cooling asphalt as the day changes to night and the nothingness gets disguised by the dark, leaving one with the feeling that a stranger could be very close by, plotting your demise.\n\n\"La Grande,\" the single from Laura Gibson's eponymous album, epitomizes desert noir. The tempo of the song matches that of a nervous heartbeat, the excitement of charging off into the unknown. You can \"smell sage burn\" in the twangy phrasing of the guitar. While the rest of the record doesn't keep the same pace, it makes lateral shifts in the same spirit, like spider-veined cracks in the brown and dry and dusty desert ground. \"Skin, Warming Skin\" has reoccurring 7th-chord guitar parts, and \"The Rushing Dark\" lends a campfire vibe to the record, with a Theremin-like saw echoing behind the rhythm. This visually corresponds to the cover of La Grande, and contributes to the desert noir atmosphere. Variations on this theme occur on songs like \"Lion\/Lamb\" and \"Red Moon,\" both of which sound more like desert samba, egg shakers and all. Gibson's voice is always accompanied by layers of effects that paint her voice into the audio landscape.\n\nGibson's songs often express an emotional resignation without being melodramatic. There is no grief in the \"seeds that could not have been sown,\" as Gibson sings on \"Crow\/Swallow.\" \"The Fire\" is both \"saddened with brave ideas\" and able to promise that \"if you're high as the sun I will not question your wings.\" This stark and stoic phrasing compliments the mood Gibson fosters on La Grande. There is nowhere to hide in the desert.\n\nThe poet Catherine Wagner writes, \"Things moralize to meet \/ my expectations because I want advice \/ on how to live.\" By a similar logic, Gibson makes her conviction that \"time is not against us\" sound believable. Of course time is against us. It is nothing if not against us. But there is a certain charm and tenderness to pretending otherwise"}

{"text":"Thus far Dancing Wayang seems like it's just started to learn how to walk, with a limp. This time it hides it better. We did a review of Mats Gustafsson's release Needs! several weeks back and we're greeted here with a similar work by Peter Evans entitled Beyond Civilized and Primitive. One thing this label needs to get right based on the press releases we've received in the past is a little less glittering generality, a little more flat factuality. So, instead of saying something like \"this album features saxophones that will explode your mind like a thousand nebulas\", which I just made up right now to prove a point, let's just go with \"this album features saxophones\". The sheet of paper that came with this one is a complete two-semester course on proper press release writing with so many examples of what to avoid you wouldn't need to purchase a textbook. Dancing Wayang really seems like it has some good intentions in mind, but it needs to think a little more beforehand. Evans' work here is more substantive than Gustafsson, but it's still for a very limited audience.\n\nAs we're told, Peter Evans is a \"maverick trumpeter\" who moves into \"uncharted territory by utilizing the recording facilities as compositional tools\", whatever that means. Can it be used otherwise? \"Hey, guys, get this, I'm going to record this with a...microphone\". Opening with that sets up a huge expectation in a listener, especially for anyone not too familiar with free jazz or musicians like Evan Parker. Looking around at some of Peter Evans' performances sets the stage for an impressive feast, but its potential hits the floor with a socks-on-waxed-linoleum thud like the \"forceful brushwork of 15 year old [sic] artist Owen Gould\" on the cover. Don't think so? Well, for a press release that indicates Beyond Civilized and Primitive includes \"overdubbing and looping\" as \"two significant techniques employed...to expand on Evan's already boundary-pushing musical exploits\" it couldn't be more short on meaning when you finally take it in. From the sound of it, and if you do a little research, Evans is a talented trumpeter, but for those of us out there who listen to more complex experimental music this is like trying to get high on air after coming down off of PCP.\n\nCase in point, there is no true usage of looping or effects in this entire album until the last few tracks, nor is there any real show of Evans' talents. The first two songs are chunks of randomness where Peter manipulates the trumpet in a variety of ways. The second, to serve as an example, is a fluctuating run of random notes for way longer than necessary with no alteration to the basic sound, no effects, and certainly none of the overdubbing suggested in the press release, nor the \"extremes\" to which he is apparently pushing \"his instrument and his lungs\". Really, it sounds like it was damn hard to sustain for the twelve minutes it runs, but it just sounds like a child rapidly messing around with a toy trumpet during playtime, and they'd probably have more stamina due to the fact that they're hopped up on a pound of sugar. It isn't until well near the end that Evans actually starts to layer some of the sounds, creating a variety of interesting structures, but for the most part it sounds like what it is, some guy fooling around on a trumpet that no one will consider impressive unless they actually played the trumpet. Since that's about one kid in every high school who spends most of their time playing Star Craft, not so good. This kind of thing isn't easy to make from how it sounds alone, it's something you'd likely need to see, but that's something you don't get from it. Perhaps it's physically impressive, perhaps it presses the boundaries of what the human body is capable of doing while playing the trumpet, but so what? It's like someone recording the sounds of a trapeze artist; all you're going to hear is the swish of the ropes and slaps of the hands. Free jazz fans might get a kick out of it, but it's not a recommendation for others. Evans has some incredible videos online, but this is a poor representation of his style other than a few brief moments.\nMySpace"}

{"text":"The House Stands Still - In a remote area of Southern Sweden, three musicians played an acoustic concert for a small audience. The art gallery where they played had previously been a barn where pigs and sheep and cows lived. It is an open, light-filled, wooden structure, airy acoustic. Outside, snowdrift, clouds, trees, tractors, a thrift shop across the road.\n\nDuring the performance, spontaneous melodies occurred, sometimes in unison. Nothing was planned because music cannot be planned. It happens or it doesn't. You are lucky if it happens and luckier if you reach those peaks where what you are saying speaks. Reflection, contemplation, levels of consciousness, dreaming. It's all in the fingers. The house you inhabit. Jonas and Shawn, limiting themselves to one or two or three notes of a skeletal scale, dwell, linger; phrases swell in the search for a satisfying interval. Tension. A blistering finale, resolution. Music, a center, a unity of space and place. Shawn's and Jonas's lines are at times indistinguishable. Sipe plays cymbals, bells, a bongo, snare skin with brushes, finger-splashed beats with water from melted snow in a boat-shaped vase. The slow roar of a cymbal played with mallets.\n\nToday, with lines of communication becoming shorter and shorter in a global culture, influences come to us from everywhere, and from everywhere else. But in order to understand a culture you have to go there, eat the food, walk around and see the houses. Transcribing and seeing notes just won't do it. By allowing the music to happen without preconception, the musicians allow themselves to express any type of influence that they come across. A brain surgeon and a football player in the same room together might quickly run out of things to say to each other. A common vocabulary, a structure, a pool of interests are needed in order to communicate, to play music. \"It doesn't matter if my name is this or that or who I am or where I come from and what I've done\", Jonas once said to a surprised interviewer. What matters is what's left when you have forgotten everything you know. Traces end here. - Philippe Aronson\n\nAuthor: John Pratt Great album.

{"text":"My Brightest Diamond, on the guitar: \"[It's] like someone you've been married to for 35 years, and it's still a great relationship, but the sex isn't quite the same.\"\n\nStory by Courtney Balestier Photos by Matt Wignal\n\nWith her slight frame, sweet voice and luminous eyes, Shara Worden\u2014the main creative force behind My Brightest Diamond\u2014looks the part of the playful sprite she embodies in MBD's ethereal, seemingly effortless songs. Funny, then, that Worden had a hell of a time learning how to write a proper song. Yes, it helps that she's classically trained (see a degree in opera studies from the University of North Texas), but the singer\/arranger insists songwriting is not an academic exercise.\n\nAh, but what is it then?\n\n1. Find your style\nAt the beginning of her career, Worden spent an entire year cranking out a song a week. The ensuing catalog not only didn't please her; it garnered comparisons to Jewel and Lisa Loeb when she was really shooting for Jeff Buckley. Not for naught, the exercise taught Worden that she thrived writing modal music.\n\nAnd what is modal music, my dear? \"If you're singing 'doe, ray, me, fah, so, la, tea, doe,' you start on 'ray' instead of 'doe,'\" explains Worden. \"The landing place in tonal music is very resolute, but in modal music, you're never sure where you're landing. The scale is more of a circle.\"\n\n2. Interact with new sounds\nWorden went through a phase of playing with air organs she'd found on the street. When a friend sent her a kalimba (a.k.a. a \"thumb piano\") from Africa, she took it out of the package and started toying with it\u201410 minutes later, she'd written \"Apple\" for her second Asthmatic Kitty LP, A Thousand Shark's Teeth. Basically, she's studied the technique for so long that her body can kick into autopilot, absently strumming or plucking, while her mind creates the music. One might think this feat is easier to accomplish by playing the standard guitar than by, say, experimenting with an African percussion instrument. Not necessarily.\n\n\"The guitar is like someone you've been married to for 35 years, and it's still a great relationship, but the sex isn't quite the same,\" says Worden. \"You take each other for granted. That's how I feel about the guitar.\"\n\n3. Accept your method\nWorden is okay with not being a prolific songwriter. Instead, she \"broods.\" For a long time. Call it a gestation period: She ponders a would-be song's energy, tempo\u2014even, on meta occasions, the pondering itself\u2014for months. Then, after a 6-to-10-hour writing session, the song is born. \"I have to conceptualize it first,\" explains Worden. \"I don't write a lot of songs, but I also don't have a lot of B-sides to toss out.\"\n\nShe's abandoned the song-a-week pace for this arrangement. \"It's scary to accept. I'll think, 'I don't know if I can write anything else.' But I'm starting to accept it.\"\n\n4. Define your \"musical language\"\nAh, the warm blanket of experience: Worden knows her band, so when she writes their arrangements, she's well aware of which notes the French hornist can hit and what her drummer will think. For someone whose lyrics are so personal, though, this also means opening up.\n\n\"When you're starting out, you're thinking, 'Where's my space? What's my sound?'\" says Worden. \"You're very closed, very protective. But the only way I can grow is by opening myself up to a little bit of controversy. With my new album, I feel more open. I've defined my musical language\u2014I don't have to protect it.\"\n\n5. Know your routine \u2026 and when to stop it\nWorden has to write alone in her Brooklyn home studio. She has to know that no one will be able to hear her, and she has to have at least five hours. \"The first hour is usually shit,\" she says, so there's no pressure about running out of time. To compose a string arrangement, well, for that she requires an entire day. That's a lot of time for tinkering, but it's just as crucial to know when that time is up."}

{"text":"GERLING\n\nAbandon the search for meaning\n\nA not-so-funny thing happened to the Australian band Gerling on the way to Japan last fall. Having presented a buzz-worthy performance at last summer's Fuji Rock Festival, the trio was completely psyched for a Japan tour set for November. Then, America was attacked. But while a lot of bands subsequently canceled overseas shows because of a newfound (or, more precisely, intensified) fear of air travel, Gerling was forced to cancel theirs for entirely different reasons.\n\nThe name of their second album, the one they were coming to support, was \"When Young Terrorists Chase the Sun,\" a title that their Japanese record company, Sony, understandably felt would be difficult to promote. \"It was pretty crazy what happened with the timing of the album,\" says the group via speakerphone from their studio in a \"junkie-filled\" suburb of Sydney. \"We finished the album in January 2001 and the artwork in February. We weren't in on that whole Afghanistan terrorist tip at all. The title was just a metaphor, kind of a challenge to mainstream music.\"\n\nFor the sake of convenience, the group's three members -- Australians Paul \"Presser\" Towner and Darren Cross, and Canadian Burke Reid -- have agreed to converse as a single entity, which goes nicely with a public stance summed by the generalizing purpose of their moniker. \"It's supposed to be nondescript. If we called ourselves, say, Angry Pack of Wolves, you'd think we were a nu metal band. We wanted it so you couldn't peg us just by our name.\"\n\nActually, it's difficult to peg Gerling even by their music, which caroms recklessly between punk, techno and old-school hip-hop, often within the same song. And given that their live shows are designed not so much to re-create records but to freak people out in the most direct, deliberate ways imaginable, one has to wonder why they need to mention an album title in the first place.\n\n\"Indeed. But last fall, radio stations were avoiding anything that could be remotely associated with [the terrorist attack]. I think the record company figured that whacking up posters with the album cover would be a bit much, so they asked the promoter to reschedule the tour until we re-released the album.\"\n\nThe silver lining is that the re-release, which has been titled \"Headzcleaner,\" will include the same songs as \"Terrorists\" (a cut originally called \"High Jackers Manual\" will be retitled \"The Manual\"), plus three new tracks, including a remix by Cornelius.\n\nGerling says they aren't put out by the time spent reconfiguring their workload. Starting over is the story of their professional lives. Having begun 10 years ago as a classic guitar-based punk band who couldn't play their instruments, they've learned to evolve on an almost daily basis\n\n\"After our first album, 'Children of the Telepathic Experience,' we did a year of touring. It then took us a while to save enough money to actually buy equipment and learn how to use it, and during that time we went through a lot of musical changes, as you can tell by the difference between the first album and this one. 'Children' was recorded and mixed in less than a week. With the second, we wanted to get our heads around the new stuff we'd processed and take our time and put out something that'll last.\"\n\n\"Processed\" is the operative word, since Gerling doesn't so much write or arrange songs as throw a lot of disparate elements together and then force them to get along with one another. Most of the time, they come up with something resembling a real song, like the summery, lo-fi single \"The Deer in You\" or the clubby soul of \"Dust Me Selecta,\" but just as often it ends up like \"Brother Keith on Destructor Mountain,\" a hip-hop tune whose composition was dictated by forces beyond their control.\n\n\"It was quite a saga, that cut. We're all fans of [old-school rapper] Kool Keith, and we sent him the track to see if he would contribute something to it. It took him like eight months, and when he sent it back it was only half done. It sounded like he'd taken all these drugs, totally incoherent. So we cut up all his words and made up the rhymes for him.\"\n\nObviously, such songs have the danger of being less interesting in concert since they are mostly reproduced electronically. \"Shows vs. records are like plays vs. movies to us,\" they offer helpfully. \"In the studio, we can become an 80-piece orchestra. Live, we're a bit more . . . punk, I guess?\"\n\nDada burlesque is more like it. Gerling shows are infamous for their lack of meaning, and while the trio are suckers for props like horses' heads and koala ears, as well as stunts like screaming point-blank into audience members' faces and inviting them up to play their songs for them, none of these things are ever planned.\n\n\"The shows are more raw than the records. A few days ago, we played what was probably our most sonically distorted concert ever. Just a wall of noise, but the audience really got into it.\" Rather than apologize for a subpar performance, they usually just blame it on another band called Gerlog.\n\nThe group's allergy to predictability may mean they'll abandon their stage uniform of button-down shirts and oversize black backpacks, a fashion flourish that clearly appealed to the excitable mob who witnessed their Japan debut at Fuji. The getup, it turns out, was lifted from Reid, who joined the band when he was still in high school (prior to that, stage gear was Superman costumes). But now that Gerling has a cult who copy the look, they've decided to switch to a \"Clash-like\" couture, though they seem hard put to describe what exactly that entails.\n\n\"Maybe we'll unpack [the backpacks] for Japan, but we've kind of outgrown them. We don't want to turn into The Residents or anything.\"\n\nThe Residents, they're reminded, always wore giant eyeballs onstage.\n\n\"Yeah, right.\" The sound of a sudden change of heart. \"That might be cool.\""}
{"text":"An Exclusive First Listen to Widowspeak's New Album Almanac\n\nby Jacob Brown\n\nPhoto: Andrew Smith\n\nMolly Hamilton's shimmering voice lends Widowspeak's lyrics a timeless, almost magical feel. Layered atop her cryptic words and eerie turns of phrase, the band's traditional instrumentation would verge on folky if it weren't so raw. The result is songs you're sure you've heard somewhere before, but know you haven't. In summer 2011, the New York\u2013based band released its first album and has the follow-up, Almanac, slated for a January 22 release. Here, Hamilton gives Vogue.com an exclusive first listen to the new song \"Thick As Thieves\" and offers us her own interpretation of what it means and what inspired her to write it:\n\n\"Sometimes my lyrics originate from memories and emotions regarding a personal relationship, but relationships always represent more than just the person. It's that moment, and your values and preoccupations wrapped up in it. This song came out of the experience of moving out of a home, and away from that life and the person I shared it with. It doesn't really make sense to leave behind something, someone, a place, a way of living that means so much to you, that represents what's best about you\u2014but eventually you do grow away from the painful part, for better or worse. As with the rest of Almanac, 'Thick as Thieves' is about beginnings and endings, and how time affects the way they are perceived.\""}
{"text":"Cr\u00fcxshadows\n\nWednesday, October 1, at Davey's Uptown.\n\nTools\n\nFew groups cross over between the goth and comic\/sci-fi communities quite like the Cr\u00fcxshadows. The quartet's music (which blends baroque melodies and rousing dance beats) and its wardrobe (which suggests that an oil tanker crashed into its closet) establish the group's children-of-darkness credentials. On the other side of the equation, the male singer's name, Rogue, gender-bends an X-Men moniker. Cr\u00fcxshadows campaigned to save the doomed sci-fi cult hit Farscape, and its members have been approached about being characters in their own comic. Recently, Cr\u00fcxshadows played an event called Dragoncon. Finally, the band has the prog set covered as well, with a 70-minute EP(!) that sports the most ornate angel-themed album cover that Nightwing never used."}

Denson's sax- and flute-playing make those sounds his own, even if he's not reinventing them. The same goes for his songwriting: The two-part title track of his 2009 album, Brother's Keeper, first makes its mark via little immediate parts like its classically slick bass hook, giving Denson and his bandmates melodic muscle memory to build on when it's time to trade solos and licks."}
{"text":"Music Review: Stepdad - Ordinaire EP\n\nIf Passion Pit and The Postal Service got drunk one night and had a kid out of wedlock, the result would be Stepdad. Hailing from Michigan, Stepdad is a two piece electronic pop outfit that specializes in synthesizers and has a sense of humor that other bands nowadays seem to lack (they wrote the theme song to popular webcomic Axe Cop for god's sakes!) They aren't self-important or feel like they are going to start the new music revolution; they are just two guys who like to make music and it shows.\n\nTheir first release, an 8-song EP called Ordinaire, has a definite sense of humor to it, but showcases some interesting sounds. The vocals are Passion Pit-like, sung in a higher pitch (not that that makes you less manly or anything), and the music is definitely reminiscent of The Postal Service (as well a little Atom and His Package thrown in for good measure... name-dropping bands is the name of the game today, my music loving friends). The first song, \"Jungles,\" is low key and sung in a very monotone serious way, and I couldn't help but think of the \"nu-metal\" craze from the late '90s when I heard the electronic drum beat and the melody of the lyrics. It's a downbeat way to start the EP, and I was a little put off by it, but it's by no means a horrible song.\n\nThe next song, \"Squares,\" was more up my alley. Upbeat synthesizers, a catchy chorus, I couldn't help but envision people bobbing their heads side to side to the beat with ridiculous grins.\n\nThat starts a string of seven songs back to back, peppy and upbeat, with some really well written lyrics full of metaphors (\"My Leather, My Fur, My Nails\" especially). The best out of all of them is \"Cutie Boots.\" Don't be turned off by the title; this is one of the best love songs I've heard in awhile. The lyrics are excellent and unlike other metaphor-heavy love songs that crowd the airwaves nowadays; this one gets right to the point of longing and missing the one you love. As a man in a long distance relationship currently, it hit home for me"}
{"text":"Saxon Shore\n\nA conversation with Matt Doty\n\n(January 2006)\n\nInterview by Adam McKibbin\n\nThe post-rock genre in music, like the postmodern movement in literature before it, is the product of a jaded and paranoid age. The thesis statement: we need to escape from our static lives, but everything has already been done yesterday. Some post-rock aficionados act as though the apocalypse has already befallen us - and only they, with their Mogwai and Godspeed records, can hope to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. Invariably, though, those waters became cluttered (and diluted), too, same as that old-time rock and roll.\n\nAre Saxon Shore post-post-rock? Whatever they are, they are a blast of crisp, creative fresh air. Helped along by producer\/engineer wiz Dave Fridmann, Saxon Shore - even minus vocals - show themselves to be a band with plenty to say. Resisting the pratfalls and overindulgences that plague so many of its instrumental cousins, The Exquisite Death of Saxon Shore is both a powerful and graceful album. And, as founding member Matt Doty explains, it is also an album that almost never made it out of the studio alive.\n\nYour bio says there was a point when you almost put Saxon Shore on the shelf. What made you come back to it?\n\nI was just feeling really unsettled about putting things to rest. I mean, I likely still would have been creative on some level, but at this point in my life where I'm still young and full of ideals it seemed best to continue giving everything I have to this. It meant more to me then just letting it become a hobby.\n\nIs music something you always imagined yourself pursuing, or was it a love that came later in life?\n\nYea, there's always been something there. When I was younger my parents would let bands coming through the area stay at our house and often they would volunteer as help for regional music expo's and festivals so I was around musicians quite a bit. I think it really came full circle since a lot of the time we rely on other people putting us up when we come to town.\n\nWas it daunting to start working with other musicians again? Were Oliver and Matthew already friends at that point?\n\nWell, Oliver and Matt Stone hadn't even met in person until after that EP was already done. There are currently five people in Saxon Shore, all five of which played on the new full length, The Exquisite Death of Saxon Shore, but it wasn't until last weekend (January 13th) that all five of us actually played music together in the same room. Six months after the album was mixed and mastered. I think gradual is the way to go as far as working with people and relationships. Kind of slow and steady wins the race. I guess that maybe even comes out in the songwriting at times.\n\nWere these songs gig-tested before you went into the studio? For people who are familiar only with the recorded output, how much do the songs stretch and shape-shift in a live setting? I read a review from a few years ago where the writer said the live show was so heavy that it was \"brutal.\"\n\nA lot of the songs we didn't play live until after the record was done. There are actually still a couple that we don't play live, or at least haven't yet. The songs vary on the tour I guess. Some tours we have a very heavy set like you mentioned above, some are a little more spacious. Our current set-list incorporates both new and old Saxon Shore material, light and heavy, tied together with sounds and space. I think we've reached a good balance.\n\nOnce you were in the studio, the bio mentions that you guys in the band would stick around and work on the tracks after Dave Fridmann went home. I assume you were obviously on the same page most of the time, but did he ever come in the next morning and say, \"Oh, no! What have you done?!?\"\n\nWell, most of that work we did when he was gone was work we were supposed to have ready before we came into the studio. So it was basically touching up the programming or adding the more ambient guitar parts and such.\n\nI've talked to some instrumental bands in the past, even fairly loud instrumental bands, who have said that they've felt like they've had to work harder at the outset to keep audiences. Have you felt the same or have you had a different experience?\n\nWe've tried not to have the loud thing be a part of what we do, though sometimes that's what it takes. People aren't always willing to give time to things that aren't obvious and I guess once that's realized it makes things a little easier.\n\nAnother uphill battle for instrumental bands can be getting radio airplay. Sometimes it seems like television or film or commercial licensing is kind of the closest equivalent\u2014the best way of getting songs out to a public that might not hear them otherwise. Have you been getting lots of offers of that nature? How do you decide what to accept and what to turn down?\n\nWe've had a few offers as of late and we're still working out the formula. Just depends on what song they're asking for, budget, and how they want to use it. Our willingness to license the track depends on the balance of those three factors.\n\nThere's a definite shortage of meandering on the record, which makes it a little unusual in comparison to some other material within the same\/similar genre Is \"trimming the fat\" something that gets attention in the studio\u2014wanting to keep the songs from ballooning to 10 minutes or 12 minutes?\n\nI've always thought it would be nice to be able to write songs that are 15 minutes long and still interesting, but I realize that's not one of my strong points, so I guess the songs are more pop structured in a sense.\n\nWhat are some things you've listened to or watched or read in 2005 that you wish everyone out there would have a chance to experience?\n\nEveryone should experience Foamhenge in Glasgow, VA. It's exactly what it sounds like: a replica of Stonehenge made entirely of Styrofoam."}
{"text":"local natives\n\nNick Van Huis: I know Gorilla Manor was named after the house you guys lived in. How did the experience of living in that house influence the album?\n\nRyan:I think it definitely shaped the way that we write songs together.I've come to find that we are very weird, in that we are so collaborative.I think a lot of bands are centered around one guy who just writes all of the songs and tells everyone what to do. But we would wake up on Saturday morning or whatever and literally just get together in the main room of the house and just write songs together around a piano and two acoustic guitars and we did a lot of the songs that way just hours and hours on end of everyone just putting in their ideas and shaping the song that way"}
{"text":"Rebore, Vol. 0\n\nAlbum Review\n\nBoredoms' ringleader Yamatsuka Eye has never been one to sit still for long, and given his immersion into DJ culture in the late '90s, it's not surprising that he should want to issue another version of his band's Vision Creation Newsun. Although some remix albums are pegged as inessential curios, Rebore, Vol. 0 is so different from its source album that it nearly achieves status as a legitimate follow-up release, rather than just a companion piece. Eye chooses to emphasize a futuristic, electronically enhanced aesthetic instead of Vision Creation Newsun's cathartic, psychedelic brawn. Sometimes the sound is reminiscent of Eye's DJ Pica Pica Pica project, wherein he compiles a hyper-speed DJ mix of world music, electro, obscure techno, and even classical music. Despite Eye's interest in techno, Rebore, Vol. 0 actually tends to shy away from outright \"beats.\" Most of the songs (all titled incorporating the number \"7\") start with a guitar or synthesizer line, and build upon that. \"77\" takes guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto's minimal arpeggio from the \"circle\" track on Vision Creation Newsun and adds space-age synth pings, what sounds like a deft xylophone line, and later brings in Hira's bassline, mostly buried in the original version. The mood is similar, but the execution is completely different, lending an intricate, graceful ambience to the piece. Likewise, \"77777\" takes Yamamoto's gentle, fingerpicked guitar figure and adds the sound of drummer Yoshimi's newborn child, later even soft vocals from Yoshimi herself. Some songs barely sound as if the same band could have produced them. \"777777\" takes a laid-back acoustic guitar figure and adds a tropical, bossa nova drum machine beat and in turn transforms the piece into a punchy Stereolab backing track. Rebore, Vol. 0 is different enough from Vision Creation Newsun that fans will have reason to listen, but more than that, it sits comfortably alongside Boredoms' best albums as a unique artistic experience."}
{"text":"For the Mekons, tenacity does pay\n\nOctober 06, 2011|By Joshua Klein, Special to the Tribune\n\nFor a group that's spent so much of its career tilting at windmills, treading against the tide of trends constantly pushing them to the margins, the Mekons seemed the farthest thing from weary survivors at Lincoln Hall Wednesday night. Having outlasted any number of Class of '77 UK punk peers, the band --an occasionally ragtag but remarkably consistent conflation-cum-collision of art, poetry, politics and music -- instead smiled sheepishly, like unlikely winners in a race they didn't know they were running.\n\nThe Mekons have been around for over three decades now, but in some ways it's taken nearly that long to fully appreciate the fact that there's really no band quite like them. While never taking itself overly seriously, the group nonetheless continues to serve as both refreshing salve and repository for Big Ideas, its ambitious albums (including the new \"Ancient & Modern\" ) as prone to inspiring novelists as other bands, its songs packed with literary and historical allusions ranging from William Blake to Fletcher Christian.\n\nWatching the oft shambling but more often stirring group Wednesday night, its eight members arrayed across the stage, was a reminder that tenacity does pay, if not in dollars then in something less tangible but no less valuable. Drawing heavily on its latest album, the Mekons nonetheless made a strong case for songs such as the childlike \"I Fall Asleep\" and the cabaret-styled \"Geeshie\" in the context of a career that's already made room for ballads such as \"Ghosts of American Astronauts\" and the earnest heartbreak of \"Last Dance.\" At the other end of the spectrum was the band at its most raucous and rambunctious, with songs such as \"Heaven and Back\" and \"Orpheus\" showcasing the band's unique alchemy.\n\nTurkish saz and fiddle alongside electric guitars, multiple voices vying for the lead, banter worthy of a stand-up routine, folky-punk (or punkish-folk) it's a chaotic act that shouldn't work, yet somehow proved more than the sum of its parts, its members united in the dogged pursuit of the collectivist ideal and having a blast in the process."}

{"text":"Review:\n\nThe Wedding Present's second\/third album (depending on which way you look at it), \"Bizarro\", was always going to somewhat difficult, given the freshness and vitality of their debut, \"George Best\" and complete anonymity of \"Tommy\". \"George Best\" marked a transition stage between the post-punk of the early eighties and the jangle pop which was coming to the fore at the time. The sound was a successful combination of ultra-fast jangly guitar riffs and lyrics which sprung as if from the heart of a hapless young man, struggling and failing to come to terms with the complexities of love, rejection, infidelity and disappointment. At the time it was something unique and was always going to be a hard act to follow.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about \"Bizarro\" is the song titles. Gone (well, almost) are the long, somewhat tongue-in-cheek titles such as \"Everyone Thinks He Looks Daft\", \"What Did Your Last Servant Die Of?\" and \"Give My Love to Kevin\". Instead, the band have become much more laconic in their titling and resorted to snappy titles like \"No\", \"Crushed\" and \"Thanks\". Yet when you hear these songs for the first time, you realise these changes are merely cosmetic - \"No\" could have just as easily have been titled \"Why Didn't You Just Say No\" but for some reason the band decided to be more sparse with their words.\n\nBeyond that, at least one part of the combination which had made \"George Best\" such a success, is still present. The lyrics still tell of the same things - of broken relationships and the frustrations of ordinary everyday people in coming to terms with changes to their comfort zone due to factors seemingly beyond their control. David Gedge has not lost the art of writing a pertinent lyric:\n\n\"And if it didn't mean that much And you wanted him to go. And if you're as sorry as you say Why didn't you just say no\"\n\nis a reaction which must be familiar to us all when faced with infidelity - an attempt to seek rational answers to something which is usually totally irrational in its intention and its effect.\n\nWhat has changed is the guitar sound. In a sense, the fast-paced jangly sound is still there. Listen to the long extended playout, almost like a jam session, on \"Take Me\" and you can hear it there. But what has happened to that sound. The sparkly clarity of the original album has gone, instead replaced by a much denser and layered sound. The result is that the album comes across as heavier than \"George Best\". The problem with this is that it tends to bury the lyrics, rendering them sometimes indistinct and cloudy. And without being able to understand the lyrics, the songs, you cannot feel that chord strike in you when you hear them. And without that, the Wedding Present have lost what made them truly unique. OK, it may be appropriate to the almost punk-revival style cover of Tom Jones' \"It's Not Unusual\", but that is one track on the whole album - and that one didn't even feature on the original album.\n\nTo be fair, the production (for that is where the fault lies) is not as heavy-handed as it was with their subsequent album, \"Seamonsters\", but then that latter work was executed by the master of noise, Steve Albini. But it nevertheless does detract from what would be an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable album.\n\nI understand, appreciate and generally welcome the fact that artists have to develop their sound. But there are positive and negative developments. And the move away from jangly guitars to layered ones is definitely, in my book, a negative development for the Wedding Present. This album could have been so much better - it could have rivalled \"George Best\". But in the end it falls short and does so in a way that could have been avoided with a little more thought put into what it was that made their debut album such a wonderful gem.\nRating: 7\/10"}
{"text":"Passion Pit's \"Take A Walk\"\n\nA few years ago (2009 to be exact), Boston's Passion Pit caused a stir with their danceable, super synth-y sound. Songs like \"Sleepyhead\" and \"The Reeling\" were bright and summery, and the band became a national hit with their full-length debut, Manners.\n\nMichael Angelakos and company went back into the studio to work on their follow-up, and aside from the occasional remix (Lady GaGa and Katy Perry were among the beneficiaries) or DJ gig from one of the members, little was heard of the band\u2026until now.\n\n\"Take A Walk\" is the debut single from their new album Gossamer, and it's pretty readily identifiable as a Passion Pit song. The synth sounds are super summery (say that five times fast) and the only really new wrinkle comes from Angelakos's usage of his lower register in most of the song. Hey, you can't do the Barry Gibb thing forever, right?"}
{"text":"always seem to be able to create an album that never loses their classic sound.\n\nTuesday night at Bowery Ballroom was a night full of raw energy to say the least. The intensity that radiates off of Moon King as they perform is like lightning. Incredibly captivating, a bit startling, but a rush nonetheless. Moon King take their dream pop\/shoegaze sound and elevate it when they perform live. The harmonies between Benjamin and Wilde are so in sync and lush. The entire set is energetic and fun. Whether it's a result of how attune Moon King are to each other on stage or because of Daniel Benjamin singing while standing on top of a drum kit, a Moon King performance is really something to experience live.\n\nThe equivalent of the ever mystifying, pulling a rabbit out of a hat for Brooklyn's Ski Lodge is their impeccable ability to have all eyes on them when they perform. It's a gift really, how they're able to capture the attention of today's ADHD generation. In today's world, people often times watch TV while simultaneously working on a laptop with their phones within hands reach. With so many devices going on at a given time, our brains have become accustomed to being able to multitask between devices, our attentions always focused on the next thing going on. Thanks to technological advances, with so many different devices out there, we've gotten to this point where when we are able to focus on just one thing, it's like a trip down memory lane.\n\nThat is what Ski Lodge embodies. Like their name, they're a place where our minds can go to relax and to put away the devices that hold our attention 24\/7. Maybe it's Andrew Marr's piercing gaze as he sings or maybe it's John Barinaga's lightning fast fingers. It could quite possibly be because bassist Jared O'Connell simply does not stop jumping around the stage while he performs. It could be any one of these factors but ultimately it is the collective effort of Ski Lodge when they perform that is able to capture the attention of a crowd.\n\nWhen Ski Lodge perform in front of you, if you're lucky enough to be able to see them live, it's like magic. It's like watching a magician pull a rabbit out of a hat. We know this age old trick well. We know what will happen every time but every time we're still amazed that it happened. A Ski Lodge performance is exactly that in that with each oncoming song, there's no doubt that the musicianship in this quartet will not be on point each time. Ski Lodge capture your attention and keep you there in a gripping headlock. That's exactly what they did this past Tuesday night at Bowery Ballroom. Their incredible hooks and soulful sound is truly something to experience live.\n\nArtist: Late Cambrian Album: Peach Record Label: Late Cambrian Release Date: 04\/30\/2013 Our Rating: Pre-Order:Bandcamp Track Listing:\n01. Lover's Point\n02. The Label Needed a Single\n03. The Year I Cut The Cable\n\nUpon first listen, it's painfully obvious that any previous or future comparisons anyone might make to Weezer about Late Cambrian will be erroneous. Why is this, you may ask? Because their newest album, Peach, makes it painfully obvious that Late Cambrian have a distinct musical style of their own. The album is incredibly exciting and opens rightly so with a melody defying, high impact song. \"Lover's Point\" warmly greets listeners with a memorable chorus and an even more memorable vocal delivery from Wlaysewki. This track not only highlights his growth since we last heard \"Ryan Gosling\" but also the creative style of the band as a whole. The entire arrangement of the opening track alone creates an electrifying and unbearable want to hear the entirety of Peach. It truly sets the mood for the album. It creates a feeling of ecstasy, joy and any other word of the like.\n\n\"I'm wading through these contracts. I'm losing touch with who I used to be.\"It seems as if with the creation of a second album also came the creation of even smarter and cheekier lyrics for Late Cambrian. With a bold song title like \"The Label Needed a Single,\" reminiscent of something Fall Out Boy would do, dreaming up such an ironic title isn't good enough. What is good enough is backing up an audacious move with insightful lyrics. \"The Label Needed a Single\" delves into the world of present day society's wants and aspirations. The lyrics spell it out clear as day. Cars, success, money, the A-List life: who doesn't want that? Late Cambrian take something that could have been a superficial pursuit of a concept and execute it with thoughtful ease. The realization of losing one's self in such a world is brought to life with the magic touch of Late Cambrian.\n\nMoments like these are an often occurrence throughout Peach. Moments of complete musical euphoria as a result of an injection of tightly arranged melodies and lyrics that are of dramatic grandeur. The album as a whole is like a family and each song is a different member. Each song on Peach has its own distinctive character but as a whole, they flow into each other with great cohesion. \"Poetry\" is the prime example of such a feat. It's a beautiful acoustic break in the pop rock-led release. While the signature rocking guitars and driving percussion we're used to have been put on pause, this light and melodious track embodies everything right with the world. Sit back and soak in the musical sun beams radiating from this band.\n\nWe've only broken the surface of the sonic possibilities that Late Cambrian have in store.\n\n\"You can be the song that a caged bird sings. We should take the next ship out to see.\"\n\nWith the kind of intimate setting Andrew McMahon is able to create, the cozy ambiance rests on top of the crowd like snowfall. Almost like a wool blanket, everyone is insulated and unable to escape, not that anyone would want to escape anyways. It's mystifying, the effect McMahon has on those lucky enough to hear him in his element. Up there, upon the lit stage, despite a crowd of a few hundred people, it all seems so commonplace to him. That the crowd, the one that has caused everyone to lose whatever personal space they already had as they push towards the stage, are not fans but family. Family that has gathered to hear their dear Andrew play his heart out.\n\nThat kind of special familial bond between McMahon and the crowd could be felt throughout the venue. It was heavy and hard to ignore. In between glances at the crowd and the clear twinkle in Andrew's eyes as he sang to those awaiting to hear their most cherished songs, there was nothing but joy radiating from all members on the stage. With every word sung and every note played, the audience could not get enough. Andrew McMahon did not simply put on a show, he put his heart out there on the stage as he performed for those that love him: his fans, his family."}
{"text":"Geek Music Band Profile \u2013 Wild Nothing\n\nWild Nothing's Jack Tatum had a pretty geeky idea for a new Web site in anticipation of the release of Nocturne, his stellar sophomore album. Since he spent most of the time writing the album under the moonlight as a creature of the night, he thought why not launch a new site tied to the phases of the moon. As you scroll the mouse over the page, it darkens as the moon grows smaller in Earth's shadow. You can even check what the moon will look like on Sept. 2 when the band plays L.A.'s FYF Fest in a few days.\n\nGeek caught up with Tatum on the eve of Nocturne's release for the following interview.\n\nGeek: Can you talk about your personal connection with the Lunar Cycle?\nJack Tatum: Sure. I guess just in relation to the album, the whole lunar calendar was born out of this idea that the record was really based in this nighttime scenario. Really, when I think about the record and the writing of it, the core of the songs was born at night. Because of that, it's got this really sleep-deprived nature to it. That's really where the whole lunar cycle came from. Initially it was just something we had incorporated into the artwork as a symbolic sort of thing. But as we started thinking about the Web site, we just really wanted a place to take care of the basic needs of a band, tour dates and that kind of stuff. But we realized through talking to people we could make this a site that translated the lunar cycle and do it in this form on the Web site so that it not only tracks where you were and would tell you what the moon would look like that night, but also as you scroll through to see what the band's up to the next couple months and see what the moon was going to look like on any given night. It's not so much born out of any sort of personal astrological obsessions or anything like that, but really as a companion piece of the music and to reiterate the feeling of the music.\n\nYeah, I was going to ask if you have ups and downs with the phases of the moon.\n(Laughs) No, not necessarily. It is something that does really intrigue me. I grew up in Virginia and have always been interested in the moon and stars and watching the sky. There's something that's really comforting in knowing the cycle of the moon. It's really a regular thing that's always there and always changing. It's really not so much something I chose because I know a great deal about it. It's a symbolic thing.\n\nIn moving to Brooklyn, do you miss seeing the stars?\nEvery time I go back to Virginia I'm like, \"Wow. I can actually see the sky.\" It's one of the things you give up, I suppose.\n\nGiven the night theme of the album, do you have bouts of insomnia, or do your truly creative moments come out at night?\nYeah, there really was when I was writing it. I actually was living in Georgia when I was writing it. I've kind of bounced around a bit in the past few years. I moved from Virginia to Savannah, Georgia. I was between tours and I really just got into this strange mode where my nights kept getting longer and longer, for no particular reason. I reached a place where\u2014I think I basically was an insomniac. I hardly ever slept. I think I got a lot of creative and musical ideas because of it. I really started to exist more in night. And really, it was kind of bad. Truth be told I would sleep most of the day and spend more of the night working on music. It was a strange time definitely. I've gotten a lot better about it, but while I was writing it was pretty prevalent. It's a strange feeling to exist in night. Everything, I think, gets blown out of proportion. Every sort of slight emotion, whether it's good or bad gets blown out of proportion. I got a lot of creative power from it, I think.\n\nI read an interview with you where you're more interested in mood than specific lyrics you've written and it feels like to me there's a darkness to the album, but also a sense of playfulness.\nYeah, definitely. I mean, not to try and tie everything in together too nicely\u2014but I think it was partly due to this sleeplessness. You have this really quick back and forth of emotions of something seeming terribly important and then you're able to look back and be like, \"Oh, that's so silly.\" So, there is a playfulness to it. There are moments on it that maybe seem laughably serious or something. Then it's a lot of observational relationship stuff, but I hope it's something that doesn't take itself too seriously."}

{"text":"Review\n\nBy 1993, Grunge Rock had seeped in from every dark, brooding corner and penetrated the typically candy-coated walls of pop music, giving way to a different kind of mainstream. Amid the angst-ridden rock of bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the Cranberries's \"Linger,\" an understated lament on the falls of love, was easily the poppiest thing on the radio. Dance-pop tarts like Paula Abdul had been extradited from MTV, replaced instead with good ol' fashioned, guitar-wielding rock bands. But beneath its alternative guise, the Cranberries debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, was filled with what can only be described as straight-up pop songs.\n\nSinger Dolores O'Roirdan's delicate brogue is less refined than but strikingly similar to that of Sinead O'Connor, while Noel Hogan's guitars jangle and pop like that other, more famous Irish band. The quietly stormy choruses of tracks like \"Not Sorry\" and \"Still Can't\u2026\" hint at the angst that would later spew out of a less inhibited O'Roirdan (to varying degrees of success) on subsequent Cranberries albums, but her voice is mostly soft and wispy here. O'Roirdan's voice is often doubled and tripled with harmonies to dazzling effect\u2014a wailing, operatic vocal floats ominously throughout the opening track \"I Still Do\" and the closing number \"Put Me Down,\" both of which find O'Roirdan tentatively leaving a dissolving relationship. Like \"Linger,\" \"Sunday\" elegantly combines O'Roirdan's tinny acoustic guitar with a sweeping orchestra, while \"Dreams\" and \"How\" mix Celtic influences and driving backbeats with Hogan's reverb-heavy electric guitars.\n\nThe Cranberries's sophomore effort, No Need To Argue, may have been their crowning achievement in regards to production quality, social and political relevance and sheer drama, but many of that album's songs were overly ambitious. Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We is instead filled with succinct, pretty songs about timeless lovelorn truths. Call it what you will: dream-pop, Euro-pop, indie-pop (the album was produced by Stephen Street, whose resum\u00e9 includes the Smiths and Blur), but while the Cranberries's music is firmly rooted in the pop-scape of the early '90s, their dreamy sonic textures and plaintive melodies weren't exactly something everybody else was doing."}
{"text":"Review:\n\nPowerpop was a sub genre of punk which is often overlooked or ridiculed and usually seen as a shameless attempt to gain commercial credibility. The Buzzcocks were probably the most well-known exponents but when it came to shameless pop preening, the Moondogs had them beaten hands down. This Northern Irish trio even managed to have their own television programme, \"Moondogs Matinee\", broadcast during children's hour in an effort to crack the mainstream. And yet, it didn't work and the Moondogs faded from view without making an impact.\n\nThe trouble was that the Moondogs were just too damn loud for the audience their record company aimed them at. And anyone who wanted loudness would not be attracted to the Moondogs. The result was failure. And yet their songs remain as a testament to how good they could have been. \"Who's Gonna Tell Mary\" was shameless pop, but was bloody good for it.\nRating: 7\/10"}
{"text":"Altar Eagle: Mechanical Gardens\n\nAltar Eagle\n\nMechanical Gardens\n\nType\n\nGiven Mechanical Gardens' early fall 2010 release, we are admittedly batting cleanup on this. But given how perfectly the record fits into the indieground's current affection for coldwave-ish pop tunes, and that Altar Eagle has gone mostly unnoticed outside of the electronic music hive and the solid base of listeners that are way into Type Records, it is fair to unearth it here. Such a sublime marriage of industrial dread and pretty, defiantly hopeful crystalline pop leaves an indelible mark on the ears, a weird but extremely familiar fabric of postgenre scraps. Consider Mechanical Gardens another sort of postnoise, one that knows how to reintroduce humans to the bleak machine and does so with deft, delicate care.\n\nAltar Eagle is the project of Brad Rose and his wife Eden Hemming Rose, with the former most often heard as a purveyor of end-times power-drone\/noise as the North Sea (and the indispensable online music zine Foxy Digitalis, and its Digitalis label parent). And if the North Sea is about the end-times, then Altar Eagle is about the what's-left, turning that hopelessness of industrial drone into gauzy melody and repurposed techno scraps. Imagine a super-liberated Cold Cave\u2014or even the xx\u2014coldwave that can be lush and even betray some warmness or at least hope\u2014which, here, leaves coldwave's resilient icy feeling as theatrical as it is.\n\nWhile Gardens is a weird sort of post-noise record, it does so by way of being a post-everything record at the same time. In all that fuzz and feedback, Gardens is deep in shoegaze\/Jesus and Mary Chain debt; and the way tracks build and loop\/layer, it's also leaning on techno. A song like \"You Lost Your Neon Haze\" is, meanwhile, one of the record's moments of perfection and where it isn't like much at all, a foggy lullaby chasing after an air raid's sense of doom delivered so precisely via a buzz deeply embedded in the mix that keeps gaining in pitch like those first chest twinges of a grand panic attack. So pretty, but it feels like standing on top of a very, very high precipice with its mix of grandeur and vertigo. Or \"Pour Your Dark Heart Out,\" which is even more overt about that tense dualism, shimmering and skittering voice and electronics over what sounds like some angry spirit shackled in the mix. It all becomes exhausting, but the sort of exhaustion to which you can't help returning"}
{"text":"And so it begins with \"One of These Days,\" looking in, up, and over in its declarations of love. It's waking up next to someone. It's feeling the wood of the church pew on your back. This is your introduction to Matthew E. White; he's convincing you to stay the night. You give me joy like a fountain deep down in my soul. You can hear him breathe in. The first time around, White only hums the chorus. Hums it. Plants it in your head as it blooms in his. Strings enter like a siren. The guitar only talks when it has something to say. The choir lets you know you're not alone. Overdubbed woodwinds and muted brass like it on top, dancing around the embers of the bass line. Whether you're a woman or man, White's mournful, get-it-on voice may be all you can hear: I don't want to live a day longer than you, so let's meet the Lord together. You can call it soul music if you want. It's his soul and it's his music."}
{"text":"The Cellar Upstairs at the Exmouth Arms near Euston hosts a regular season of folk clubs (restarting in September, it's not a summer sport) with some of the top names in today's folk scene as well as talented locals who just like to get up and have a go.\n\nThere's something very unworldly about folk clubs. It's not like other gigs. You're not allowed to talk \u2013 you have to be there for the music and nothing else. Although young people are technically allowed to attend quite frankly it's frowned on and those twenty somethings who do make it in clearly just haven't picked up on the signals yet.\n\nHowever, Leon Rosselson (who's excellent boxed set The World Turned Upside Down is still getting overplayed in my house) is one of a small number of performers who can draw a marginally younger crowd. Partly because of his gentle humour, partly because of the profile that comes from longetivity and getting covered by Billy Bragg, but most of all because he deserves a wider audience.\n\nThere's nowhere like a folk club\n\nWhen the first song of the evening is an unaccompanied song glorifying Irish rebels fighting the British you do tend to think, \"this isn't happening anywhere else in this city is it?\" and so even if you don't get the music it's worth experiencing just the once simply for that feeling.\n\nEver since the post-war Communist Party monopolised folk it has been a heady mix of stylistic conservatism and political radicalism, an effect that has long out-lived the life of the Eastern Bloc. You'll hear very few pro-market, or pro-Empire songs in a place like the Cellar Upstairs despite the fact that if you go back far enough you'll find a forgotten history of clearly right leaning folk songs. In that sense folk clubs are as much about shaping a \"new\" tradition as they are about keeping an old tradition alive.\n\nOrigins aside the egalitarian spirit feeds into exactly who gets to perform \u2013 i.e. anyone who wants a turn gets one. Surprisingly the standard is pretty high despite the lack of quality control, but even if there were, well, misjudged performances they'll be over soon enough and they'll give you plenty to talk about in the break over a beer.\n\nThe prevailing attitude of miserable criticism of both modern life and of how hard life was historically is possibly far more appealing than it may sound and where the performers are conscious of that miserabalist underpinning and play on it there is genuine joy to be had.\n\nLeon Rosselson\n\nThis was the second time I've seen Rosselson live an the first thing that struck me was that not a single song was the same as the set I saw him do back in February. I suppose when you take the need to promote the latest album out of things long standing performers get to tailor their set to each audience from that extremely long back catalogue.\n\nRosselson is a charming and literate singer songwriter who indulges his own pleasures and if the audience like it, well that's all well and good but I get feeling that an optional extra rather than the purpose of the exercise. That's another reason to like him.\n\nRosselson's material often focuses on the gentleness and fragility of individuality in a world that expects you to conform. He glories in those who refuse to fit into a consumerist, market orientated world as this illicitly filmed youtube video shows (is this on?) but you won't get agitprop or sledge hammer communist songs. There's a depth here that means Rosselson is far more than a protest singer but rather one the best writers of our age who's work is both politically engaged and emotionally rich."}
{"text":"Our anniversary celebration continues as artists including Fleet Foxes and Bat for Lashes talk about the music that made an impact on them over the last 15 years.\n\nI was a very precocious 11 year old growing up in the suburbs of New Jersey. I wanted to know everything. I would kidnap CDs from my older sister's room, and Whip-Smart was one that stayed in my room for many months. I really liked the explicit nature of the lyrics. I wasn't particularly interested in dating and guys at age 11, but I was really interested in Liz Phair's jaded cynicism, toughness, confidence, and how it sounded like she'd experienced everything. Basically, I wanted to be Liz Phair.\n\nAfter listening to it for a few months, I remember painting my nails with my friends while hopped up on the album. We were totally giddy, trying to be these teenagers that we weren't yet, and we dropped the nail polish on the floor. It was red, and there was shattered glass everywhere, and the whole room looked like a crime scene. At that moment, I had this epiphany that maybe Liz Phair was actually sad at times. I started to understand that, behind the toughness, there was a lot that you didn't see.\n\nWhen I told my sister I really liked Whip-Smart, she told me that Exile in Guyville was a more interesting album. And listening to those albums side-by-side was very important for me because it was the first time I was trying to figure out what made one album more interesting than another. It wasn't enough for an album to have catchy songs that you wanted to sing along to; maybe there was some kind of depth to one album that was missing from the other one.\n\nI stopped following Liz Phair's music, and I think everyone was confused when she reinvented herself as a pop star. I don't blame anyone who's trying to make money, though. But she reviewed Keith Richards' new book for The New York Times recently and she did a really good critical reading of it, which made me think, \"She's still got it. She knows exactly what she's doing.\"\n\nI was very serious about music in high school; I'd listen to things that were either very depressing or very angry or very introverted. I liked Radiohead a lot and thought music had to express every possible ounce of pain a human can withstand in this angelic, tortured choir-boy voice. [laughs] I wore a lot of black in that particular time-- the goth phase.\n\nI was doing record reviews for the school newspaper and thought it would be fun to write about records that no one in my school had ever heard of. Mass Romantic had been on a bunch of critic's lists for that year, and suddenly, I realized that it was OK to like pop music [laughs]. That was a big epiphany. I couldn't believe Neko Case's voice was real; it sounded like it was digitally altered. I didn't know how to pronounce her name-- I thought it was \"Necco\" Case, and I kept picturing these sugary candies called Necco Wafers. People used to mix them with tabs of acid, and I thought that was exactly what her voice was like: sugary sweet meets acid trip.\n\nRight before I heard Mass Romantic, I wrote a movie review of that Britney Spears movie Crossroads for the school newspaper. I thought it would be funny to write these reviews of movies without giving them a chance, like \"Yeah, I feel so superior! I hate pop music! I hate pop culture!\" But after listening to Mass Romantic, I had to change my attitude: \"Wait, I actually really like pop music. I sort of like pop culture, too. Britney isn't so bad all the time.\"\n\nI was an English major with a focus on poetry writing at Harvard, and my poetry teacher gave me Joanna Newsom's first CD-- he was like that teacher who totally changes the course of your life. So I was super into The Milk-Eyed Mender, and then my friends invited me to go see Joanna Newsom play live when Ys came out. I felt like I'd been transported to another world. Ys has a lot to do with the death of a loved one and discovering your own creativity, all done through very mystical poetry, and I was also dealing with those same things. I felt like she was speaking directly to me the whole concert. I was like, \"How can this happen?\"\n\nI listened to that album on repeat for so long. I could spend days trying to figure out just a single complex metaphor. The one that stands out to me is: \"In the mud cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky'd been breathing on a mirror.\" It's like John Donne, who was a really early metaphysical poet, or Yeats. That image has so many layers and the ideas you can draw out of it are also manifold.\n\nThe main thing I learned in college is that if you're going to make a piece of art, you'd better have some emotional urgency behind it; otherwise, it's not worth making, and you'll never accomplish anything with it. When I think of a performer who's willing to be super weird and super naked and always writes with some kind of urgency, I think of Joanna Newsom. It's a good lesson in being yourself. Live, she makes these faces, and she squats a little bit, and she is very physically involved with the instrument, which is cool. I try to do all that stuff, maybe not consciously, but I like to think that I'm not just standing around and staring at my shoes. I don't really care about keeping up with appearances-- I've pretended that the guitar is a machine gun and shot the audience with it. I saw a nine year old do something similar at the Rock 'N' Roll Camp for Girls showcase concert a few weeks ago. It was a little shocking.\n\n\"Mass Romantic had been on a bunch of critic's lists for that year, and suddenly, I realized that it was OK to like pop music. That was a big epiphany.\"\n\nThis whole album is such an absorbing experience, which is really rare these days; the album as a unit is not really prominent in the same way it was 10 years ago. Part of it has to do with her really laying herself bare emotionally, stripping down pretenses, and laying out the really uncomfortable stuff-- that's what a lot of people identify with Titus Andronicus, too. People are looking for that right now, in the age of free-floating media that seems totally detached from the person who's creating it.\n\nCarrie Brownstein wrote a piece for the NPR blog where she talked about how it's sad that we don't really care what the artist's intention was these days, whether it's to be indie or political or feminist. But, with this album, it's very clear what the artist's intention was: to save herself from despair, to put it bluntly. She talks about her own failure, which is really brave.\n\nI think you can learn something from every song, whether you like it or not. What it's about, per se, doesn't really matter-- you can try to understand the pieces and how they fit together, which is important if you want to make any kind of art. That's how I'm listening to music right now. I'm not just going to listen to a band and say I like it; I always want to say why I like it. It's like having a puzzle you have to put together every time you hear a song.\n\nI was living in downtown Manhattan and, if you were in New York during the 90s, you'd have to be a corpse with no pulse to not be into hip-hop-- it was the main thing I paid attention to that decade. And Reasonable Doubt was like a tidal wave. It was ridiculous. It was released in the summer, and you heard it on the street everywhere, possibly more than Illmatic or Ready to Die. Back then, hip-hop was still super regional and very territorial-- there was the whole East-West thing and the South hadn't come up just yet. That's why Reasonable Doubt is such a New York record to me.\n\n\"If you were in New York during the 90s, you'd have to be a corpse with no pulse to not be into hip-hop.\"\n\nI play on this record, but it really did have the biggest impact on me that year. It's not even because I think it's this awesome record, it's more about what it means in my life. In 99 and 2000, I didn't do that much playing. It was after Helmet and I had just turned 30 and I went through a musical midlife crisis, in a way. And I fractured my wrist, which meant I couldn't play for 10 months. It was pretty scary. I was in a really strange musical head space around that time, and I didn't know what I wanted to do. It was like, \"Should I go back to school? I'm gonna go broke. Do I have to get a job?\" All these big questions. And then the opportunity to do this album came totally out of the blue. It's the record that reinvigorated me as far as what it means to be a musician. It was really fun to work on, and I hadn't experienced that since the early 90s.\n\nI lived in Cologne, Germany for a while, and I was right across the street from Kompakt. The Total series is a collection of all the releases of the year, like a little reminder. I was sort of into techno before that, but 2006 was when I surrendered to the techno religion.\n\nIn the 90s, I thought the rave scene was really silly in New York. It was just kids in enormous pants in Washington Square Park. But it's a totally different scenario in Europe, and especially Germany. It's much more civilized and a little more elegant-- but also 50 times more decadent. And you can't escape it. You hear it in super markets. That's what people are blasting from their cars. Cologne is a very professional city-- it's kind of the polar opposite of Berlin-- but on the weekends people go out Friday and come home Sunday evening. Some of those Kompakt parties didn't really start going until 5 a.m. There's definitely an art to surviving those situations without drugs.\n\nAnd those experiences definitely influenced my playing with Battles. It's not like I started playing all these four-on-the-floor beats, it's much more the ideology behind the music, which rubbed off on all of us. I would go to Cologne and come back and give CDs to the guys in Battles. That's how \"Atlas\" started-- that's just us mimicking the sound of the Cologne shuffle.\n\nThey're three girls from Tokyo that make this really trance-inducing kind of Krautrock. It's super minimal: guitar, bass, drums. There's something really genuine about it because it's almost like they went to a music store and drew straws to decide who would play what. It's also very unpretentious, which I really like. They don't come at you with thie obvious angle, like, \"We're three little Japanese girls playing Krautrock.\" They're sort of a secret, though I'm not sure for how much longer.\n\nThis was the first time I knew heartbreak: England was defeated by Germany in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-finals of the Euro 96 [soccer tournament]. I was 10 years old. The tournament was held in England, so for many kids my age, this was the first time we'd really been swept up in the fever of things. I was certain the tournament was ours to win. That wasn't the case.\n\nWorst of all was that after we exited the competition, it continued for a week. There was a final to be played. The only way I can explain it to a non-sport fan is to imagine your girlfriend's broken up with you, and then the next day you see her out in town, having an incredible time, sucking the face of some other guy. But, then again, because North Americans only really care about sports that no other country in the world does, I'm not sure you'll ever know how I truly felt. (I jest. Mostly.) This was the official song for England's team that year; imagine if that song Weezer did for the U.S. team at the World Cup last year wasn't really shite.\n\nTo this day, no song gets an uncontrollable emotional reaction out of me like this does. Within a couple of bars of harpsichord and the defeatist soundbites, every hair on my body is on end, and there's a lump in my throat and tears forming at the corners of my eyes. This is no exaggeration whatsoever. But then, maybe it's not the music that gets the reaction, but the football. Football will always be my number one.\n\n\"'Three Lions' was the official song for England's football team that year; imagine if that song Weezer did for the U.S. team at the World Cup last year wasn't really shite.\"\n\n2001: The Beautiful South: Carry On Up the Charts\n\nThe main thing to happen in my life in the ensuing five years (besides England being defeated in two more international soccer tournaments) was my parents breaking up. It's hard to remember how it affected me at the time, but the older I grow, the more hopeless I become and the more I long for Something, the more vivid my memories become, and the more pivotal an event it seems to be.\n\nBy now, I'd only just started to show a mild interest in music, and the only band I really cared for, and who to this day I still care for (now more than ever, in fact), was the Beautiful South, my parents' favorite band. For reasons I can never quite pin down (Their \"hits\" sounding too much like Hits? The fact they all looked like your uncle? That they toured with the Barenaked Ladies?) Paul Heaton isn't constantly held up as the greatest British lyricist of all time. Anyone who can write lyrics so brazen that a bandmate feels uncomfortable singing them and chooses to leave instead has to be admired. Politics, pop culture, sex, death, and a turn of phrase like no other. I long to be as good as Paul.\n\n\"They say never meet your heroes, but it's well worth the risk if you can become best buds with them.\"\n\nThis is the year Los Campesinos! formed-- primarily due to having friends in bands (poor bands, objectively, very poor bands) and being jealous of the reaction they could get. I don't really like the person I was then. I always tried to second guess what people wanted from me, and how I should be. I had a pretty high opinion of myself, too. Not as being a better person, but I felt like I was different. Really, I was a dick. Kind of like every kid who reads Catcher In The Rye and then thinks he's a lot smarter and more interesting than he really is.\n\nThis was my favourite album of that year, but its real importance didn't come to show until a couple of years later, when I found myself fortunate to meet and tour with [Parenthetical Girls leader] Zac Pennington. Although it was only for a couple of weeks, we formed a very strong friendship. One for the ages. I even got to sing onstage with them around this time, and it's the most nervous I've ever been about a performance. They say never meet your heroes, but it's well worth the risk if you can become best buds with them. Sometimes after becoming friends or even acquaintances with someone who's made a record I love, it's difficult to hear the music in the same way, or take it as seriously. But that's really not the case with Safe As Houses. It's as incredible and affecting now as it was the first time I heard it.\n\nIn all the years since that last entry, I've been in Los Campesinos! It's so weird to think that a fifth of my life has been devoted to being in this band, and that I've now been out of university for longer than I was in it. It's a weird dynamic between being arguably the luckiest I've been in my 25 and a half years, but also the saddest. 2011 is currently the year of the most upsetting breakup of my life. I'm hopeful the release of our forthcoming album will help exorcise that and give the year new significance for me but, if it doesn't, I'll find comfort in the knowledge that each breakup that follows will probably ache that little bit more.\n\nI hate my 20s, if I'm being honest. Being teenage is a breeze, and by your 30s (I anticipate; I fucking hope) you've had a chance to work things out a little, but in your 20s you're stuck between \"it's time to grow up, be an adult\" and \"but you're still so young, you shouldn't settle, live your life\". (Waaah, waah, waaaaah, I know).\n\nThis is the song that reminds me of the aforementioned relationship. I've deleted it from the tracklist of Thank Me Later because it's too much stress to listen to it. It calls to mind things that a beat and groove as sexy and yearning as this completely necessitate, and I'd rather not be reminded of it all right now. But it's appropriate because everything Drake's put out this year has been incredible, and the-Dream is my favourite contemporary artist, and I'm beyond excited about both their albums coming out in close succession towards the end of the year. That's hopeful, right?\n\nThings were a lot different back in the 90s [laughs]. Access was a lot more limited, so you had to find the vinyl, and that wasn't easy. There was this element of the chase, and the reward of actually getting the item was that much greater. That's one of the reasons Gal Costa's record was so special to me-- you had to seek it out and then when you found it you were like, \"This is so unique and weird and awesome and nobody else knows this shit.\" To me, it seems like our current access to everything all the time has made people a little bit more blas\u00e9. But, on a lot of levels, it's extremely useful to have this accessibility to music as an artist and a consumer. You take the bitter with the sweet, I guess.\n\n96 was was a crazy year, because Tortoise's A Million Now Living Will Never Die came out and we were getting a lot of press and we probably did 140 shows. It was awesome. When we made that album, we were still operating under this assumption that we were this totally fringe thing that nobody ever cared about and we were absolutely only doing it for ourselves. Then, all of a sudden Thrill Jockey told us that they had 10,000 pre-orders and we were like, \"What the fuck is going on? This doesn't make any sense.\"\n\n\"It seems like our current access to everything all the time has made people a little bit more blas\u00e9. You take the bitter with the sweet, I guess.\"\n\nJim O'Rourke turned me onto this record. It's from the late 70s, but I became aware of it in 2001 and it totally blew me away on so many levels. Part of it was seeing these obviously well-off Japanese dudes imagining their version of Bollywood or some contemporary Indian music, but done exclusively with primitive synthesizers. And they pulled it off. I always considered this record to be this weird artifact that had no precedent or antecedent. It completely stands on its own. It doesn't make any sense in Haruomi Hosono's discography or in terms of whatever people have done insofar as appropriating other cultures musically. It's just so bizarre and wonderful.\n\nThey're an electro-acoustic improvisational group that has some jazz elements. I always wished that Tortoise was able to improvise like Supersilent. We've tried. We have great improvisers but for some reason we just can't really pull it off. Supersilent are so utterly unique because I can think of very few groups that have that level of empathy and innate understanding-- it's almost like precognition. They're speaking to each other without saying anything, it's incredible. You see a group like that and you're like, \"How do they do it?\"\n\nI hold improvising in high regard, but the jam band scene doesn't interest us in the slightest. It's not a value judgment, but it's just not our thing. Right around that 2006, all these people were trying to wedge us into that scene. Our management was like, \"Trey Anastasio has an opening slot in his tour, you guys should do it.\" We were like, \"That is the worst idea we've ever heard.\" We'll play Bonnaroo, but that's about it [laughs].\n\nFrom a job security point of view, it's beautiful, because those bands have built-in audiences that will come back again and again, and they don't really care what you do. They just want to see you play for two hours, and you can keep on doing that for 40 years. It's amazing. There is no other genre of music that has that kind of audience except maybe classical.\n\n\"I hold improvising in high regard, but the jam band scene doesn't interest us in the slightest. We'll play Bonnaroo, but that's about it.\"\n\nI grew up on metal and hardcore, so I'll definitely always have a place in my heart for loud, heavy, fast music, and this album appeals to that. One of their obvious influences is This Heat, and that's my favorite band of all-time, hands down.

{"text":"Norwegian quartet Wibutee's third album for Bugge Wesseltoft's Jazzland label is a (micro)chip off the new block, as the group continues its exploration of electronica, jazz, and backbeat-driven rhythm.\n\nIn the main, we're dealing with grooves here\u2014some of them chilled, some of them urgent\u2014and what improvisation there is, most of it coming from Haron Kornstad's Stax-meets-free improv tenor sax, is concerned with maintaining an electronically defined ambience or soundscape rather than developing linear or harmonic ideas.\n\nPlayed in the background while you're cooking or whatever, that's what Playmachine sounds like: background music. But there is substance here, and the more closely you listen, the more you discover.\n\nThe album kicks off with an arrestingly urgent funk groove, Kornstad playing the theme on what sounds like a conch shell (but is more likely a synthesised effect) before he introduces his acerbic, ruff 'n' tuff tenor. The overall vibe is one of restrained ferocity, and it's repeated on \"We Are In Space, So Are You\" and \"Rodeo Activity\"\u2014both featuring more of Kornstad's tenor, with \"We Are In Space, So Are You\" also fronting some tongue-in-cheek theremin-like effects.\n\nBut the most rewarding tracks are the lazier, neo-balladic \"Country Practice,\" \"Gerewol\" and \"Figment.\" These have an off-centre, late night, at times downright eerie feel to them, and showcase the group's electronic and programming skills\u2014which are at least as important as their instrumental ones\u2014to more singular effect. These skills are notably combined, by the way, on \"1.800.SKAUEN,\" in Kornstad's flutonet, which sounds, as the name suggests, like a cross between a flute and a clarinet.\n\nLikely to appeal equally to electronica buffs and the more \"out\" end of the jazz audience (anyone who likes the altogether wilder Critters Buggin', for instance, will probably get off on Playmachine ), Wibutee offers a welcome and refreshing sound from the Oslo underground."}
{"text":"Dusted Reviews\n\nSince 1995, Finland's Jan Anderzen has issued a baffling array of releases under the name Kemialliset Yst\u00e4v\u00e4t, from cassettes to 7\" singles and 3\" CD singles \u2013 even a double 8\" lathe cut picture disc, of all things. Anderzen's latest release, oddly, is self-titled. Is this his ultimate statement? Did he run out of titles? Who knows.\n\nPuzzlement seems to be a common reaction when people hear Kemialliset Yst\u00e4v\u00e4t for the first time. The sounds and instruments are often difficult to identify. Sure, there's sometimes guitar, often bubbling synth, but then there are droning things, a seeming junkyard of percussion tinkling and rattling away, and voices\u2026or are they?\n\nWhat differentiates the dozen songs on this 42-minute album is what I'll call the degree of randomness. The most successful songs offer enough structure that a listener can feel involved in the proceedings; others simply let sounds fall where they may, applying a sort of audio-Pollock approach. At its best, the album reaches a sort of ecstatic ceremonial peak, while at its worst the results are like a preschool group let loose in a room of musical instruments.\n\nOne of the highlights is certainly \"Superhimmeli,\" filled with plucked acoustic strings and muttering voices that break into psyched-out dreamsounds with pounding drums and fuzzed-out guitar. The ornately-named \"Kokki, Leipuri\u2026\" (I'll leave off there) feels quite ritualistic, with careful string plucking, droning, and obscure percolating sounds; and closer \"Himmeli Kutsuu Minua\" is a beautiful psychedelic march, a thickly layered piece with ringing percussion, synths, voices and perhaps even horns \u2013 as is frequently the case here, it's hard to tell exactly what all's going on. But the results are marvelous.\n\nMany of the other songs, though, simply feel too aimless. It's not precisely a bad thing, but the stronger songs indicate too clearly how good this band can be. The three minutes of \"Merkkej\u00e4 Iholla,\" for example, are a pleasant enough processing of randomly tinkling percussion, buzzing sitar drone, and chanting voices, and while you're listening, the sounds flow past smoothly. But afterwards it's a challenge to recall what was just heard.\n\nWorse are the few songs that are actually difficult to listen to. \"Himmelimenetelm\u00e4\" is much like being in the midst of a group of children hopped up on sugar, and the blooping, clinking, hooting sounds verge on the annoying. \"Valojuopot\" is an uneasy mixture of randomly bleeping synths, wailing noises and a babbling, muttering voice. It's likely to be an amusing dada-esque song to some, and irritating soundscape to others.\n\nWhile unpredictability and playfulness is a large part of what makes Kemialliset Yst\u00e4v\u00e4t so interesting, there's a potential here that feels unfulfilled. It wouldn't take much, but if Anderzen can apply just a bit more control, and use his sound-crafting abilities in the service of a more focused vision, something truly great could be the result. In the meantime, there's certainly some gold in these hills, but it may take some excavation."}

The track, from the group's recent D full-length, gets even more tripped-out by Bjorn Yttling from Peter, Bjorn and John on this remix. Here, the original's droning organ takes on a bigger, pricklier presence, while the band's vocal and lyrical style, plucked straight from a late-'60s garage, is all about \"the things we'll say for drugs.\" They hover over a hypnotic guitar chug, electric squeals and driving tambourine, clouding the sonic field until everything peaks and reaches a certain rock 'n' roll clarity."}
{"text":"The Slideshow Effect\n\nSub Pop; 2012\n\nArtists:\n\nFind it at:\n\nThe Ontario duo Memoryhouse began not as a band so much as an art project. Denise Nouvion was a photographer who took dreamy, spectral-haunted photographs, and Evan Abeele a music school grad with an equal love of neo-classical composers and My Bloody Valentine. After meeting through friends a few years ago, Nouvion and Abeele embarked on a collaboration: He composed minimalist instrumental tracks to soundtrack her short films and accompany her photo exhibits. At some point, though, Nouvion's plaintive, placid-lake vocals got added to the mix, Abeele started writing bridges and choruses, and Memoryhousemorphed into a full-fledged dream pop band.\n\nIt's fitting, then, that the band's full-length debut, The Slideshow Effect, which they say refers to \"the photographic\/cinematic technique of zooming and panning to animate still images\" (I guess The Ken Burns Effect lacked a certain poeticism), is scattered with pictures. In \"Bonfire\" Nouvion sings about throwing photos in a pool and, later, holding a print up to light to wistfully observe the fingerprints it bears, while on the gently melancholy \"Punctum\" she comes to a conclusion that will ring true to anyone who's ever fallen into a late-night abyss of Facebook photo flipping: \"It's not enough to live your past through photographs.\"\n\nIt's tempting-- given the band's creation story and the record's overall aesthetic-- to dismiss Memoryhouse as the ultimate example of a tumblr come to life and calling itself a rock band. (The cover, shot by Nouvion, doesn't help.) But a closer listen to The Slideshow Effect reveals that there's more to them than that: Unassuming as they occasionally feel, the tracks have a solid construction, visible through the fog-free clarity of Abeele and recently recruited bassist Barzin Hassani's production. Operating in a subgenre where every producer's M.O. seems to be \"I've got a fever, and the only prescription is more reverb,\" Memoryhouse's sound is refreshingly articulate.\n\nThey're at their best when they kick up the tempo-- the bright, drum-machine sputter of \"The Kids Were Wrong\" is an early highlight-- though they don't seem to have realized this yet: The back half of the record sags with pleasant but near-indistinguishable slow jams such as \"Pale Blue\" and \"Kinds of Light\". Still, in its more compelling moments, The Slideshow Effect's overall vibe of glistening inertia isn't a strike against it, but rather an embodiment of its central theme. The album is a painstaking portrayal of the dissolution of a relationship, which makes its frozen, photogenic poses take on a kind of poignancy: Stay stock-still and everything will remain as it's always been; move a muscle and it all falls apart. Nouvion uses some variation of the phrase \"lie still\" at least half a dozen times. \"Go to sleep, nothing's changing,\" she sings with a potent twinge of self-denial on \"The Kids Were Wrong\", \"I'll be right here by your side.\"\n\nMemoryhouse frequently get compared to Beach House, who explored similar themes on their magnificently gloomy 2010 album, Teen Dream. Memoryhouse have a ways to go before they're creating music with as much melodic power or depth of feeling as their dream-pop contemporaries. But as their development from the gallery to the stage has shown, there's every reason to believe that The Slideshow Effect is just a baby picture."}
{"text":"Rufus Wainwright, \"All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu\"\n\nLess than a year after the premiere of his first opera, \"Prima Donna,\" Rufus Wainwright embarks on a simpler musical journey with his sixth studio album, \"All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu.\" With nine original songs and three adaptations of Shakespearean sonnets, Wainwright's solo piano accompaniment highlights his extremely adaptable voice in a different manner from previous efforts. On \"Sonnet 43,\" where Shakespeare's narrator longs for his absent lover, Wainwright reaches the lowest range of his rich tenor over gentle chords. But \"Give Me What I Want and Give It to Me Now!\" recalls a raunchy vaudeville number. the calm accompaniment of the track \"Les Feux D'artifice T'appellent\" involves Wainwright thumping on the piano's sounding board and plucking its internal strings to simulate fireworks, while occasionally ascending into falsetto. Some fans may miss Wainwright's more complicated orchestral numbers, but a single piano is all that's needed to show off his immense vocal talent.-Erin Clendaniel"}

{"text":"Listening to the new Horisont record \"Second Assault\" is an adventure in time travel. You don't simply listen to the record, you hurdle backwards towards it. I am in a darkened, smoke-filled bar. Twenty or so spectators in different states of inebriation hoot and howl arhythmically as the band spews molten rock'n'roll. Half the crowd looks like Popeye Doyle, the other half look like Tuesday Weld. A poorly dressed, ratty haired bunch of skinny kids reach into their chests and pull out their guts in the quixotic attempt to find a higher plane if even for a moment. Their suffering is ours.\n\nIt's an imperfect fantasy, mostly because of the smoke. That itchy, uncomfortable feeling of unfamiliar scum clouding your vision. Not knowing whether to choke or sneeze. Somehow it doesn't matter and it does. Rock'n'roll itself comes with a bit of discomfort. Loving it is a masochistic pursuit. Horisont gets that in spades. They explode everywhere, like a wayward roman candle knocked on its side. They are dangerous, blistering and blood-fanged; they are the sweat in your eyes and the exhaustion of endless impossibility.\n\nThe 70's reek of old carpet and cheap cologne.

{"text":"Secret Cities, Katlyn Conroy and the Wild and Wooly and Tut Tut at the Record Bar\n\nThe night began with Tut Tut, Alex Abnos' solo project. Katlyn Conroy and the Wild and Wooly filled the bar with a set of warm, warbling lullabies, and the night finished off with a torrential downpour of chaotic pop band Secret Cities (Abnos plays drums for the band).\n\nAbnos played with the crowd, bantering freely, soliciting harmonies and fetching a chair in the middle of his set. \"Can I get some reverb?\" He asked the sound guy. \"I have reverb envy.\" His delightfully stark songs were mostly Abnos toying with his ukulele, but his deep, Zach Condon-like vocals and funny flourishes enriched his set with a memorable charm. (It also helps that Abnos does more with a uke and an empty stage than most people have the balls to attempt, coaxing sounds that range from banjo to percussion out of the toy-sized instrument.)\n\nKatlyn Conroy and the Wild and Wooly's Saddle Creek-influenced folk isn't shy about its strongest asset. In short: Gawd almighty, Katlyn Conroy's pipes pack a punch. Conroy's caterwauling, ramshackle band -- including the Wild and Wooly's signature trombone and violin -- provided the perfect chaotic element to complement Conroy's rich, heady vocals. (A highlight: \"Drapes,\" a song hauntingly rendered by Conroy and her violinist, showed a stripped, frank emotion that was nothing short of heart-wrenching.)\n\nSpanish rthyhms, flailing noise and crystalline, Enya-like vocals all made brief cameos in Secret Cities' set, which was tethered by whistling and wavering melodies. It helped that Abnos muscled outrageous amounts of sound out of his drum set that grounded the band and propelled it to transcendent heights. What's weird is how the physical image of the band jives with its saturated, mature sound. Secret Cities' MJ Parker and Charlie Gokey met at band camp, and, dude, it shows. (At one point, Gokey took a break from his thrumming guitar playing to flash devil horns in the air during some tribal drum thumping. Why?) Without the dorky visuals, though, the band is a treat to see live: Gokey and Parker's meditative attention to detail pays off in Secret Cities' rich, arresting live sound.\n\nEDIT: It should also be mentioned that 20,000 Strongmen played and that, like a dick, I missed them. Sorry, guys."}

While the poetry constructs visions that echo theories, the music concurrently builds within itself in an almost polyphonic style to attest innovation through inspiration.

{"text":"'Interventions + Lullabies,' The Format\n\nAs far as teenage pop music goes, there isn't a whole lot that can transcend and speak to older age groups. Characterized in recent years by elementary chords, immature lyrics and male singers still waiting for a voice change, the whole category of music sells out from the get-go. Teen pop seems to just produce and reproduce the terrible music of bands before them (see: Blink 182, A Simple Plan, Sum 41).\n\nThough they're few and far between, it's always refreshing to find that there are youngsters out there producing reasonably intelligent and thoughtful music. The Format is groundbreaking within its genre, but the duo still has a long way to go before it can cater to a wider audience.\n\nTheir debut is a page ripped from the journal of a teenage boy -- or at least it seems to be. Nate Ruess and Sam Means have vocals similar to Ben Folds, but with the immaturity of Ben Kweller. They couple their ballad-like songs with synthesizers, drum machines and acoustic guitars, unfortunately emerging with an awkward, unpolished product.\n\nThe first single, aptly named \"The First Single,\" is hardly representative of the rest of Interventions and Lullabies (Elektra). It's an excitable, drive-with-the-windows-down song, with Ruess and Means practically laughing out the lyrics.\n\nBut the happiness stops there. The rest of the album takes on the attitude of a spoiled teenager wanting to run away from home. While it's OK to vent those feelings through a few songs, the Format makes the mistake of singing about their angst on every single song on the album. It gets old fast, and I spent the rest of the time listening to how many times the words \"leave,\" \"leaving,\" \"gone\" or \"alone\" popped up on the album.\n\nWhile I commend the band for exploring new instrumental combinations, they often cram too much into one song. On \"Tune Out,\" the duo starts the song off slow, creating a nice conversational tone with the listener. But it's completely ruined when the song lurches into a hyper chorus and hammered-out chords. It's like striking up a nice conversation with someone, then suddenly yelling at them and sprinting away in mid-sentence.\n\nThe Format has a fair grasp on how to create decent music, but they don't really get past musical adolescence here."}
{"text":"The Dreamy Dancers\n\nSchool of Seven Bells \u2013 Disconnect from desire\n\nThe Skinny: Dreamy. A word you'll see a lot. Also, poetic lyrics, like describing a lucid dream.\n\nThe review proper: Ah, School of Seven Bells, a trio who love their music to be reverberated and enveloping. This second album, Disconnect from desire, is considerably louder than Alpinisms, but hey, who wants the second album to be just the first album repackaged with a different cover?\nOf the very beginning, you're in for a treat. The vocalising attack is already in full gear in 'Windstorm', the face punch that opens the album. If you're a first comer to this band, this is the song that either will pique your interest or go into seclusion.\n\nThe groove maintained by the first songs moodily changes with an upbeat jolt, courtesy of 'Babelonia', the overdriven song that is as dreamy as they come. The treated vocals, the simple but thunderous guitar riff and the tambourine (classy!) make it quite catchy. As layered as the song is, it keeps building, with more stuff building upon it.\n\n'Joviann' is beautiful, like a Monet-coloured skyline, it's dreamy, with the combination of voices by and the music going for a wall of sound approach (with a few pauses). The track does take its time, though, so the more impatient ones might not dig this.\n\nHowever, if you want something jittery, go for 'Camarilla', swaggering the right combination of guitar with synth work. It's one of the briskest songs in the whole album, without ever abandoning the ethereal sound that encompasses what School of Seven Bells is.\n\nLyrics wise, I can't find any fault, it's the perfect compliment to such a surreal sound. There's some sweet moments, and then there's the defiant declaration that hurts just because it is quite true : \"More useless to me than a motto is a creed \/ 'Cause this vain imposition is a loaded decision \/ Hiding in it's vision a treacherous seed\" (from 'Camarilla')\n\n'Dial' is another prime cut from Disconnect from Desire. There's no simple way to describe this intricate song and trying to put it in a box that goes into bit or bat genre would be useless. It is breezy and dreamy, simple as that. The music throws a few curveballs (I dig the voice inflection during the \"I was relieved\" part of the song, going from an angelic tone to a sigh of relief).\n\nThere are a couple of songs that didn't do the trick, though, but then again, it would be improbable to like it as a whole. Maybe 'Bye bye bye' would be the only one that I would take out of the mix, as 'Dust devil' felt as the stronger twin in the electronica infused song from the album.\n\n'The wait' is a perfect album closer for Disconnect from Desire. The instrumentation is sparse, just adding a few strokes here and there, it's all about the voice(s), and again, the mental imagery of the lyrics. I hate to waffle this review with more lyrics, but here they go \"We get so hypnotized by \/ The imposed rhythms of the passing time \/ Urgency solely defined by \/ Degrees of dissatisfaction in our minds\".\n\nIt is an album that does require your full attention. As just background music (a common malaise on the consumer-side of today's music), it's acceptable, but as a full experience, it's lush and poetic (check the lyrics for 'Dial', really"}

Adams's musical style seems derivative of the comedy duo, without their offbeat (and funny) twists. For coming from so far away, the cultural references are surprisingly familiar, as are the punchlines. It's not difficult to be the funny guy in the group if you drop the words \"balls,\" \"douche bag,\" or \"ginger pubes\" into any story\u2014this is more a function of language than wit. However, Adams's delivery is charismatic enough to keep the material moving forward.\n\nHis real talents are evidenced in the bits between songs, such as a routine that contrasts his disconnect between thoughts and words when faced with a girl, or a pre-recorded audio commentary on his guitar tuning. Even an Andy Kaufman-like \"awkward silence solo\" is funnier, and more original, than the song it was featured in. Clearly there's room for growth here, and Adams's enthusiasm and genial stage presence seem like a solid platform to make it happen."}

You slowly glide across, looking down at a group of smiling children playing in the summer sun. Paula's elegantly wistful voice brings back the fondest of memories. If Sea Oleena decided to break away from her Canadian roots and record some songs in Spanish, it might sound something like this."}
{"text":"Farewell to 1995, a year in music we'd rather forget\n\nIn the post-Nirvana world, the most popular of pop music exists contrary to Kurt Cobain: Where Cobain gave us revelations without confessions (especially on In Utero), the current crop of post-grunge rockers foist upon us imitations without hesitation. Rancid offers nothing but a pale Clash-Specials copy right down to their leather clown outfits; Green Day, whose Insomniac was a better record than Dookie and sold less to prove it, is the Who on a Buzzcocks kick; and Bush and Silverchair emasculate music until it's no less a formula than 2+2.\n\nThere's so little honesty in rock anymore, so few musicians from whom you get the sense that they need to make music. Sure, PJ Harvey does (her demons could kill Sin\u017dad O'Connor's); Dave Grohl does (like a shotgun blast); Geraldine Fibbers frontwoman Carla Bozulich does (the ex-junkie's lament); Brian Wilson does (he might go...crazy). But what does Live have to say? Or Darius Rucker? Or Natalie Merchant? They just offer up the same trite aphorisms set to lullaby melodies: \"I alone love you;\" \"I only wanna be with you;\" songs about River Phoenix (\"This star fell down on Hollywood Boulevard\"). Shut the fuck up.\n\nTop 10 of 1995, give or take\n1. Foo Fighters, Foo Fighters (Capitol\/Roswell). \"I don't owe you anything,\" Dave Grohl growls during \"I'll Stick Around,\" declaring his independence from the myth and legacy of Nirvana. There's no dismissing this album (for which the former Nirvana drummer wrote every song and played every instrument) as a glorified solo project by a drummer-turned-frontman; it's a mission statement, palpable in its emotion--from Grohl's frenzied guitar playing to the constant threat in his voice to the songs that somehow balance '70s pop-rock melody with punk-rock fury. When \"Weenie Beenie\" erupts, the guitar building to a climax over which Grohl's distorted voice can be heard saying \"One shot, nothing,\" it's rock's finest moment of 1995.\n\n2. To Bring You My Love, PJ Harvey (Island). She's a blueswoman to the core, Howling Wolf born in the fragile, pale body of a 26-year-old British woman who sings about her \"Long Snake Moan.\" There's nothing easy about Polly Jean Harvey--not her harshly gorgeous voice, not the distorted guitars atop the string sections atop the haunting background organ, not the subject matter that finds the Devil wanting to have the Lord's baby. Unlike Rid of Me, on which every song began as a whisper then exploded into a roar, To Bring sustains one note throughout; it seethes, it growls, it drones, it mutters, but it never yells--it never exorcises its demons, suckling them instead.\n\n3. Lost Somewhere Between The Earth and My Home, The Geraldine Fibbers (Virgin). The Fibbers' full-length debut opens with the sound of a fiddle whining in the dark as a bass guitar drones in the distance. Then, from nowhere, electric guitars and drums kick in, transforming the caress into a punch. This is an epic record, a collection of literate short stories narrated by Carla Bozulich--a former junkie whose tales of sin and salvation are undercut by a constant hopelessness--and set to a dissonantly beautiful punk-rock beat with a country hitch. Singing in a voice that's almost androgynous, Bozulich crafts tales of losers who are almost beyond redemption; they're lost, self-hating, haunted by their pasts even when they do kick their habits. \"I never knew nothing 'cept hunger and fear,\" she sings from the \"Outside of Town,\" waiting for the bus that will take her to heaven--or hell. \"I'll never be nothing--I'm ready to go.\"\n\n(Tie) 4. A.M., Wilco (Reprise); Tomorrow the Green Grass, The Jayhawks (American Recordings); Trace, Son Volt (Warner Bros.). Standing in the Sons of Hermann Hall bar hours before Wilco's May show, frontman Jeff Tweedy came up with a catchy catch-all nickname for his--and the Jayhawks', and Son Volt's--brand of music: \"rural contemporary,\" he called it, hinting at the country and rock and roll contained within. If nothing else, 1995 was the year \"roots-rock\" meant something: These three bands, Dwight Yoakam (whose Gone approached country as though it were Top 40 from 1964), and Geraldine Fibbers (\"grievous angels who looked down from the heavens and spit\"), prove country no longer belongs to the clones Nashville keeps dropping off the assembly line.\n\nWilco and Son Volt are the two sides of Uncle Tupelo revealed independently of each other for the first time--Tweedy's giddy pop songs set to a hillbilly backbeat; Jay Farrar's moody scene-setting country played like he was fronting Crazy Horse. If Tweedy's music seems lightweight in spots, it is only because it is hopeful and open: \"If you'll come back again, I'll still be your friend\" is his idea of a breakup; and \"Passenger Side\" is the best ode to drunk-driving written by a guy who's been clean and sober for years. Farrar, though, leaves little room in his claustrophobic travelogue through America's black heartland; his is a desolate, wind-swept, abstract ghost town for which he provides the equally stark sound track, no matter how elaborate the instrumentation. The Jayhawks, who have since broken up, split the difference between the lush and heartbreaking (\"Blue,\" \"Two Hearts,\" \"Nothing Left to Borrow\") and dense and moody rockers (\"Real Light,\" \"Pray for Me\"). Like Uncle Tupelo's Anodyne, Tomorrow plays out like a bittersweet farewell, at the very least."}
{"text":"La Dispute\n\nMostly described, or more likely pigeonholed, in music articles as\nsimply a post-hardcore band, the Grand Rapids, Mich., quintet known as\nLa Dispute has more going for it than grinding guitar riffs that MUST BE\nPLAYED LOUD. Credit vocalist Jordan Dreyer for lending the group's\nnoteworthy distinction, as he passionately delivers complex lyrics with\nhis gravelly spoken-word punk raps that make you think\u2014even when your\nears are bleeding.\n\nDreyer's unique vocals, however, are something of a mystery even to\nhim, as he recalls his outfit's formative stages back in 2004 when he\nwas still in high school. \"It's just the fact that I didn't know how to\nsing before we started,\" he says with a laugh with regards to his band\nmates. \"It was all our first go at it, especially mine. Everybody\nalready knew how to play an instrument, but I didn't know what I was\ndoing; it just came out that way. I never had a particular {musician}\nperson I really liked or a vocal style I wanted to emulate. More than\nanything, it was an accident.\"\n\nWith several LPs and EPs under their belt, La Dispute will have\nplenty of material to draw from when they make their first visit to\nCentral New York on Friday, April 27, 6 p.m., at the Lost Horizon, 5863\nThompson Road, DeWitt. But wait, there's more on the bill: traveling\ntour mates Balance and Composure, All Get Out and Sainthood Reps, plus\nlocal tuneage from The Scarlet Ending. Admission is $12; call 446-1934\nfor details.\n\nAlso during this tour, La Dispute has partnered with 826michigan, a\nnonprofit tutoring center that helps kids with writing and\nself-expression. At each stop the philanthropic band will sell\nfundraising limited-edition packets that include photos, postcards, a\nposter and more.\n\nDreyer took time out from a stopover in Texas for a quick phoner, whereupon he was pleasantly surprised that the Syracuse New Times enlisted some teenage fans to help with the grilling: Cicero-North Syracuse High School sophomores Amy DeLapp and Taylor Leden.\n\nQ: What is it about Grand Rapids and cold weather: Is that an\nincubator for rock'n'roll music? Because Grand Rapids probably has the\nsame type of weather as Central New York.\n\nA: I think it's impossible to not be affected by your surroundings\nand weather is a part of that. You know, for four or five months a year\nit's cold and snowing intermittently, and it definitely affects your\nmood and that translates to your songwriting.\n\nQ: How did the band get its name?\n\nA: It comes from a {1774} piece of classical French theater by a man\nnamed Pierre de Marivaux, something that I saw performed when I was\nyounger and we were first starting to write songs. And the play's theme\nof French discord was exactly what we were talking about at the time,\nand it made sense and it stuck and here we are years later.\n\nQ: What was more important to you when you were getting into music: making the music or using music as an entry for meeting girls?\n\nA: {Laughs.} It was making the music. All of the boys shared a common\ninterest in music, and we enjoyed going to shows, and more than\nanything it was just a way to have fun and make ideas and, for the\nsecond time in five minutes, here we are now years later and still doing\nit. It's always been about making sense and being creative.\n\nI was a junior in high school when we first started playing music.\n{Incidentally, Dreyer's birth date is Sept. 3, 1987.} We really didn't\nstart consistently touring or taking it terribly seriously until a few\nyears after that, but the very beginning was in 2004 so, yeah, I was 17.\n\nBrad Vanger Lugt, our drummer, and I started playing music together\naround that time and we enlisted a couple of friends and shortly after\nour first release {the 2006 EP Vancouver on Friction Records}\ncame out we had a member change: Chad Sterenberg, one of our current\nguitar players {along with original member Kevin Whittemore}, replaced\nhis older brother Derek the day after we put our record out. A couple of\nyears later our original bass player {Adam Kool} quit and a friend of\nours from Indiana {Adam Vass} moved up here and joined. And really, ever\nsince then we've all been on the same page and taking it seriously.\n\nQ: How early did you start writing songs?\n\nA: When we first started playing music together. I've always enjoyed writing, but it was my first stab at writing songs.\n\nQ: What was it like singing for the first time?\n\nA: Probably pretty similar to what it feels like now. I'm sure I was\nnervous, and there are still days when I get nervous now. But there's a\nwhole lot of adrenaline involved, being up in front of people and\nplaying, and it doesn't take long to shake that nervous feeling and\nsettle in.\n\nI did a fair amount of theater in high school. I did Forensics\u2014not the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\nforensics\u2014but dramatic performance, and I really, really enjoyed that,\nand that probably helped. I've always been comfortable in front of\npeople.\n\nQ: How flattering is it when people at the shows know all of the\ncomplex lyrics to the songs and are singing them along with you?\n\nA: It's an incredible feeling. The physical representation of\npeople's interest in your music is pretty exciting, something that I've\nnever been able to put into words, and something I can never really get\nused to. It's a brand-new excitement every time it happens.\n\nQ: Have you visited any real dives during your years of touring?\n\nA: Ohhh, man, when we first started touring consistently, we were\ngetting self-booked places like kitchens, basements, back yards, anyone\nwith a PA who would let us come in and play. We've seen some strange\nthings, we've been to some filthy places, but they're all cherished\nmemories.\n\nQ: (Amy): How do you feel when people refer to you as a modern-day Shakespeare?\n\nA: Ohhh, man {laughs}, about what I feel right now hearing you say\nthat. I'm not entirely good at accepting compliments and I think that's a\npretty bold one to make, but it's very flattering.\n\nQ: (Taylor): If you weren't a musician, what else could you see yourself being?\n\nA: I have a hard time calling myself a musician as it is. I love to\nwrite, so if I wasn't doing this I'd probably be pursuing a career in\nwriting elsewhere.\n\nQ: (Amy): Who would you like to make another split EP with, like you\ndid with Koji {for the 2011 Never Come Undone on No Sleep Records}?\n\nA: Oh, we were talking about this the other day. There are so many\nphenomenally talented bands out there and we have so many really great\nfriends who make great music. I don't want to say anyone specific\nbecause it might not materialize, but any of our friends, truthfully;\nit's just a matter of making it work. We'll see what happens in the\nfuture.\n\nQ: (Taylor): When people hear your name, what do you think they think of?\n\nA: {Laughs} I don't know, hopefully not terrible awful things. I hope\nthey think I'm a nice guy and that I care deeply about what I do and\nall the extensions of that. . . but who knows?\n\nQ: (Amy): The Wildlife album (2011) has a completely different sound\nthan the experimental Here Hear albums (2008). What sparked that change?\n\nA: Well, Here Hear is a separate entity altogether; it's something we've done since 2008. They're both significant parts of who we are as a band; Here Hear\nwe did as a challenge to ourselves creatively as a way to expand our\nhorizons and also broaden the context for anyone else who is interested\nin checking who we are as a band. There was no deliberate stylistic\nshift; it was just the things that we did {musically} that coexisted\nwith each other.\n\nQ: (Amy): I've been trying to look up the set lists for the shows\nthat you're playing but they're all so different. How do you choose the\nsongs that you play?\n\nA: Ummm, well, typically before we go on tour we practice a bunch of\nsongs and then we kinda separate them into groups. Then before the show\nwe kind of switch things up depending on where we are, or the venue;\ndepending on how close we are to another show we might have played;\ndepending on if other people who are coming out who have already seen us\nbefore; depending on the last time we were in that city. So we try to\nchange it every night to keep it exciting for the people in attendance\nand also to keep it fresh for us.\n\nQ: (Taylor): What was your favorite Halloween costume?\n\nA: Do you remember those really bad Alltel cell phone commercials,\nwhere the cool guy was the Alltel guy and the Verizon guys were the\nnerds? One year we dressed up as those five guys in the commercial and\nthe Alltel guy was named Chad, so we made {band member} Chad dress up as\nChad. He even got his hair cut short and he never had short hair, which\nwas pretty hysterical.\n\nThe only bummer is that we didn't really get a chance to play because\nwe were doing a show in our hometown at a university and {the venue}\nwas only rented out until midnight, and then there was going to be an\nEdgar Allan Poe fan club reading of The Raven. So we had to be\ndone by midnight and two of the bands had technical difficulties and it\ntook them way longer to play their sets. By the time we were ready to\nplay it was 11:45 p.m., so we played only three songs, all under the\nviolent stare of a bunch of people dressed up as Edgar Allan Poe\ncharacters.\n\nQ: (Taylor): Have you ever performed in front of a crowd that didn't\nseem into it? And did it make you perform not as good, kind of?\n\nA: We've performed in front of a lot of crowds who were not\ninto it over the years, and there are two reactions that I think you can\nhave. The easiest one, and the most defeated one, is to let it psych\nyou out and not care about your playing. The other, I think, better\noption, is to channel it into your performance, to accept the fact that\npeople are going to hate you, so you might as well make them hate you\neven more, and just play as hard and fast as you can.\n\nQ: (Amy): Who is your favorite band you've toured with so far?\n\nA: Oh, you're going to get me in trouble. I can't give you a\nfavorite! I had a really good time touring with Trash Talk; they were so\nmuch fun to watch every night. More than anyone we've toured with\nTouche Amore {last seen April 17 at the Lost} and they're our best\nfriends. They're amazing live.\n\nQ: Do you have any favorite rock'n'roll movies?\n\nA: A Hard Day's Night is a good one. And This is Spinal Tap, too, of course. My favorite piece of music-related cinema is the Metallica documentary Some Kind of Monster:\nIt's hilarious in a completely non-intended way. But I think it's also\ninteresting to have a sneak peek into that realm of music, you know,\nfour dudes who have never been required to grow up and be responsible\nadults.\n\nQ: You're coming to Syracuse for the very first time to play the Lost\nHorizon, a club that's been around for 40-plus years. A lot of acts\nhave performed there over the years: the New York Dolls in the 1970s,\nBobcat Goldthwait in the 1980s, and many more. So you're part of a\nhistorical bunch of people who have played there.\n\nA: Wow! It's the first and last time you'll ever hear our band's name\nmentioned in the same sentence with Bobcat Goldthwait. Or the New York\nDolls, for that matter."}

Enjoy!\n\nWhether you're in need of a celebratory banger or something mopey because [s]he won't return your calls and you're going to die alone and in the company of cats and years-old newspapers, there's something for whatever you're feeling this weekend.\n\nThe street was empty from Trinity Church to the East River. No suits spewing from the 1-2-3 and no sad-faced men chopping chicken and onions on street carts and no assault rifles dangling lazily from shoulders around the Stock Exchange. There was, as there had always been in some sense, only emptiness and the rustle of dollars in the wind as it funneled down the urban canyons.\n\nSo the semester is finally over and the grading's done and the fast food binge cycle is drawing to a close and I'm instituting a new, hopefully regular thing at Dohaha: the Weekend Playlist.

Though, to be fair, one didn't typically envy coroners in general.\n\nThe family prayed, as they always did, in a rough half-circle around the face of the tombstone. They said the Lord's Prayer together, though the boy always just mouthed the words. Even at ten years old, he didn't really buy it, and anyhow, the sight of his remaining family chanting in unison struck him as fairly ludicrous, but then again, he knew there were a lot of things he didn't understand about the world. That feeling never really left him.\n\nThe cabin vibrates as the engines kick and the plane hurdles forward and he tries not to think of the last person he saw before turning down the corridor to his gate.

{"text":"There's something a little otherworldly about Swedish jazz-rockers Oddjob. While there's an unmistakably retro feel to Sumo, its third release and first to receive widespread distribution, there's a strange, futuristic skew to its groove-happy roots in '60s and '70 soul jazz that keeps the music slightly off-kilter.\n\nThe members of Oddjob have clearly done their homework. Drummer Janne Robertson opens the album with a New Orleans Second Line-style solo, \"Kingston,\" before the group enters for the breezy, waltz time \"The Big Hit,\" Per \"Rusktr\u00e4sk\" Johansson's flute meshing with Goran Kajfe\u0161' trumpet to recall late-'60s\/early-'70s CTI albums like trumpeter Freddie Hubbard's First Light (CTI, 1972). The same orchestral approach is there, with pianist Daniel Karlsson creating a dense, sometimes jagged backdrop over bassist Peter Forss' unshakable groove and layers of added percussion. But the slower, sleazier groove of the organ-centric \"Golden Silver\" feels more off-center, a combination of a simple, three-chord organ pattern with a serpentine trumpet\/sax frontline, and a drum pattern that keeps the groove but feels somehow displaced alongside guest Stoffe Wallman's odd synthesizer textures, which periodically percolate to the forefront.\n\nThe instrumentation fits the time, especially Karlsson's electric piano, which creates a Hancock-like abstraction on the insistent \"Sewerside Blues\" where, despite a clear form, there's the feeling that chaos is just around the corner...or over the edge. Johannson's saxophone and Kajfes' muted, wah wah trumpet solo in tandem, acting like an island of general calm before the move towards anarchy resumes. The result is music that grooves hard, often rocks hard, but in its pursuit of outr\u00e9 expressionism and occasional impressionism, never compromises.\n\nThe gentler, melodic \"Sm\u00e5land,\" with its elastic sense of time, references early Weather Report, but is more direct, with clearer construction. Assorted instruments, including zither, vibraphone and glockenspiel, contribute to a soundscape of a time while also feeling grounded in a possible musical future. Karlsson's tremolo piano, along with Robertson's behind the beat kit work and heartbeat pulse, suggest a bluesy kind of Americana, except that the horn lines, clearly rooted in soul jazz, twist things on their edge, taking it to another place entirely.\n\nThere are plenty of solos, especially for Kajfes and Johansson, whose opening duet with Robertson at the start of the irregularly metered yet funky \"Punch\" is a set-up for one of Karlsson's most concise and compelling features of the set. \"The Day TV Stood Still,\" on the other hand, is more modernistic and progressive, with a persistent pulse and layers of sound; something Sigur R\u00f3 might come up as a musical interlude.\n\nA clear case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, everyone in Oddjob is a fine player, but together they possess a curious musical conception that coexists simultaneously in two very different places\u2014that of retro soul jazz group and futuristically textural explorers. It's a winning combination that gives Oddjob a distinctive voice, making Sumo one of 2008's most unusual electric releases."}
{"text":"The Actors Profile Page\n\nThe 3rd EP by San Francisco's The Actors is called \"High and Low.\" It was released on September 9, 2010. It's got 5 songs and runs about 20 minutes. All of these electro-rock songs were played by hand (i.e. no programming, drum machines or Ableton). These are, without a doubt, the best and most heartfelt songs we've ever written. We're incredibly proud of all of them, and can't wait for people to hear this music.\n\n2. \"Through a False Door\" -- ancient Egyptian temples and pyramids included a \"false door,\" which was constructed so that the departed may safely pass into the spirit world. Has an opening lyric that would be awesome on the radio or a car commercial: \"Hi there, I'm a dead body.\" Kind of a Cure \/ XX vibe on this one.\n\n3. \"First Date\" -- this one is least about me (or maybe most?). Boy meets girl; boy and girl kill everyone. Pop music, hooray! Sounds like a lost top 40 single from between 78-82.\n\n5. \"Go Home\" -- turning the \"why don't you take your ball and go home?\" childhood taunt into positive action. As in, \"I've had enough of this garbage; I'm going home.\" It's like a fake, non-sexed up Prince song, right down to the Oberheim."}
{"text":"They Might Be Giants - The Spine\n\nLyrics to The Spine\n\nIf ever they gave out Grammys for mule-minded consistency, then Sting would have a lot more awards in his villa. But coming in a close second would be They Might Be Giants. Keyboard player John Linnell and guitarist John Flansburgh have a sense of focus that would put even the Ramones to shame. From the Brooklyn duo's first demo tape in 1985 up to its frenzied latest, The Spine, the same ingredients remain at the fore: effortlessly catchy choruses, songs that smear the line between novelty and being novel (new ones include \"\"Memo to Human Resources\" and \"Museum of Idiots\"), and musical backing that sounds like a cross between a polka party and someone throwing silverware down the stairs. It's a quirky approach that's not going to easily win over any new converts but the will certainly drive the dedicated legion of old ones to smile with familiar-yet-fresh material like \"Experimental Film\" and \"Au Contraire.\" --Aidin Vaziri"}
{"text":"Sessions\n\nSunday, 18 March 2012\n\nSlow Animal - Slow Animal\n\nI got into Slow Animal a year or so ago, after their first initial demos were plugged on Pitchfork. They soon became a firm favourite, playing a distorted, loud, and fierce blend of garage rock and surf rock. Of course, I can hear your inner monologue from here chirping 'oh jeez, another surfy garage band? like that hasn't been hammered into the ground' And I know. But they're not mock imitations of Wavves and Jay Reatard like Bleeding Knees Club or something. They're special. Honest.\n\nWhat makes them worth checking out is that they pack the virtual aggression and energy of a punk band with the breezy and hazy chords and simplistic beats most associated with garage\/surf bands. Plus, they'll go from that to suddenly transferring into crashing cymbals and powerful power chords. They're very much an energy building band. They bring more to the floor than most 'friend' bands that can only play major bar chords and get sporadic claps from mildly amused audience members who are politely trying to remind themselves that high amounts of energy isn't always key to a good band. And even if that is true, Slow Animal aren't a band that leave you waiting for loud attacks and catchy riffs. They give it to you from the start.\n\nWith their self titled debut album, it is evident they have progressed since their initial demos. The energy is higher, the drumming is fiercer, the songs are more detailed. A lot of the initial demos seemed to centre on small helpings of chords that often repeated. Not to say that is a bad thing, a they're still great songs, but with their debut release, the songs are a lot more fleshed out and mature. The band have evidently progressed.\n\nIn the new stuff, there are repetitive elements, sure, but there is still a clear feel that the band aren't focused on rewriting the same songs. And sure, there are typical calling cards, such as there use off their distinctive harmonies and hazy demeanour, but they still write bloody good songs. Songs like 'Teenage Strange', 'Liar' and 'Rather Have My Eyes Closed' stand out in particular - their unusual, yet catchy chord usage and playing styles, going from passive to intense, ultimately fill the songs out well.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with SA's debut release and I know I'll be returning to it in the future. A nice start to your forthcoming summer.\n\nOh, also, they're giving their album away for free on their website -  - so there really isn't an excuse not to check these fuckers out."}

{"text":"Tell us about your music - how did you develop your sound?\nWe're really into classic pop songs with a great melody - mostly stuff from the 50's-70's. Like Fleetwood Mac, The Beach Boys, The Beatles etc, all the classics. So I guess our sound is borrowed from all of those bands that we like but our focus is just to write good songs that stand strong melodically. Lots of harmonies, lots of hooks, lots of space for things to move.\n\nWhat's the Rainy Day Women live show like?\nOur songs are pretty short and to the point on record, so we like to extend things out a bit live and get a groove happening. We just want to get good vibes across and do our best to make sure the audience is enjoying themselves. Not taking ourselves too seriously, I guess. We don't wear shoes on stage.\n\nTell us about the bands, producers and people in the Perth music community that inspire you.\nThe producer for both of our EP's so far, Andy Lawson (Debaser Studio) , has been quite a mentor. He's really invested in what we're doing and has taken the time to help us grow as songwriters (forgive the clich\u00e9). We love Perth exports like Tame Impala and bands that are doing their own thing. Place of Indigo are a local band that are going at a sound that isn't the usual.\n\nWhat's the best advice you've been given and who was it from?\nI've heard a lot of people say this, but I think it was Sam from the Rubens that stuck it in my head. It was, that you should never write music with the main objective of it being widely liked. That's not to say to stay away from writing pop songs, but just to be honest with song writing. It's really easy to slip in and out of trends but people can tell when you're being honest. Phases come and go, I'd rather be playing music that I was passionate about to an empty room than playing music that I didn't like to thousands of people. A wise man once told me to eat the chips first because you can always save the burger for later, but the chips go soggy in the fridge.\n\nWhat's coming up in 2012?\nWe've just released a new single called 'Runaway' which is off our upcoming EP and are in the middle of a very busy month of shows promoting it. In between that we are writing for an album. Our new EP 'Friends' will be out in February and we're so damn excited to share it!\n\nAustralian music is...\n...exciting! You can trawl Unearthed for hours listening to different music that is generally of a pretty high standard. All of the Aussie bands that we have played with have all been such good people and that makes the whole thing so much more fun. There's a community and a party wherever you go."}
{"text":"Review:\n\nSix. By Seven. Remember them? Yes, they're still going. This, their second last album, being limited to 1000 copies is quite hard to come by... but man is it worth the search. After the underground success of the I.O.U.Love single back at the beginning of the decade you expect that they'd never be forgotten, but with a little help from themselves they've slipped back into the pretty-boring-really-Nottingham scene. You'd have thought they'd split up or become some Joy Division tribute band, but really this album proves they should not've lost their place at the forefront of the Midlands lad-rock scene. Songs such as Push, and War Nations mix the surreal reverbs of Spacemen 3 with the pounding anthems of Oasis. Speaking of the latter, who cares if they split up? SIX BY SEVEN STILL EXIST!"}
{"text":"Buy now from:\n\nnorth carolina's band of horses return for album number three, newly expanded in line up and drawing deeply on america's rich musical history. the band sealed their status with their previous album, 2007's 'cease to begin', building on their early online, blog buzz acclaim. 'infinite arms' sees the band, led by ben bridwell, drop many of their 'indie rock' pretensions for a more classic, rootsy american sound. kicking off with the pretty ballad 'factory', it's a beginning at odds with 'cease to begin''s 'is there a ghost', favouring a laidback approach over walls of rushing guitars. it's also a good indicator for the rest of the album's twelve tracks. stand outs amongst the slower songs include 'blue beard', its stately swagger topped by coo-ing harmonies and punctuating guitar chords with a chorus that recalls starland vocal band's 'afternoon delight'. from their indie rock beginnings band of horses have grown into modern american torch bearers, their grasp on state-side music and history apparent in their effortlessly authentic yet ageless sound. 'infinite arms' is their strongest album yet, perfecting their instantly recognisable sound with bridwell in fine voice throughout.\ndescription from"}

{"text":"Kristin: I've hear you refer to the touring versus recording components of your career as schizophrenic.\n\nEmily Haines: Yes, well first you're in a studio and you're in one bubble. And then you're on the road and then you're in that bubble for an indefinite period of time where you don't do any writing or do any recording. So what we've tried to develop as musicians and as just human beings is a lifestyle that just allows us to be less schizophrenic. So, you tour some, you do some shows and come into studio and write a couple songs. When we were writing Fantasies, we were very open about writing our songs with our fans. So when we were on the road, we were road-testing things, getting reactions from people, feeling it out and making the \"live\" part of our life part of the writing as well. Like so many things for so many people in their lives, people will tell you that things are supposed to be done one way. But if you ask questions and do a little research as to why those rules are in place, no one can tell you why.\n\nJames Shaw: It's like no one bothered to try and redefine the rules for the last 35 years. That's the way it's done and that's it. You're either running for 6 months straight or standing still. We're just trying to find a way to walk a few hours a day.\n\nKK: So we're at Polaris, what about this prize works for you guys.\n\nEmily: I think it's an amazing idea, concept, and what it represents. It's been compared to the Mercury Prize, which has obviously been around a lot longer. But if those are the goals of what Polaris would like to become I think that's great. Metric as a band has always been called to mainstream for the underground and too underground for the mainstream. So now we'd like to say we're too underground for the Junos and too mainstream for Polaris. That's kind of our new spot.\n\nKK: If you were to vote for someone, anyone including yourself, who would it be?\n\nJames: Obviously there's going to be a winner, but if I had to be the one to decide it I'd run away. I'm not into choosing people,\n\nEmily: Ya, we don't do favourites.\n\nJames: To say one record is better than the other, you know? There are however many judges and they all vote. And if you chose a whole other group of people, [the result] would be totally different. I just like to make music and I like that everyone else is making music too.\n\nMeaghan: In your traveling life, do you get a chance to listen to much Canadian music?\n\nJames: Ya, totally, all the time. You'd be surprise how many hours you're just sitting on your ass waiting for something to happen.\n\nEmily: We've been listening to Flash Lightening which is a band that Jimmy's been producing in our studio, Giant, here in Toronto. So that's been on the speakers a lot. It's been on headphones trying to figure out how the hell we're going to finish this record.\n\nMB: Let me guess, if you had 20,000 dollars it'd go to expanding the studio?\nYes, some in this room and some all over town use the studio. We build it in the hood where everyone lives.\n\nEmily: It's the affordable music studio for musicians by musicians. So if we win the Polaris Prize, the money will go straight to that."}
{"text":"Wednesday, April 27, 2011\n\nAfter School is known for very strong songs - not always in terms of technique or musicality, but in terms of sound. \"Diva\" and \"Ah!\" were very Euro dance and it had a hit-you-over-the-head hook and loop, \"Because Of You\" was very angst-y with the right amount of grace, \"Bang!\" was punchy in a sharp kind of way, and even \"LOVE LOVE LOVE\" had spunk. They are known for their conviction - for the fact that they're not cutesy-cutesy and whatnot, but can still call themselves a girl group. Their music is the epitome of the concept of \"girl power\" in Korea.\nIt's a well-established fact by now that I like After School more than your run-of-the-mill girl group at the moment, and it's also well-established that I like them mostly for their material, and some of the members. And because I like them, a part of me is more demanding of them - because I've seen what they are capable of and I know the extent to which they can humanely push themselves.\n\nI don't usually incorporate things like personality and all that into my reviews, but to be completely honest with you they're known as a band with very strong personalities, and they've not only managed to show that in the way they move and act, but in their music. Don't try and deny it because you know it's true - they're classy, strong and intense, it shows in the material.\n\n\"Shampoo\" is what would most likely come out of mixing \"Because of You\" and \"Ah!\"\/\"Diva\" - let's stop at that for now. The piano lines and string section were borrowed from \"Because of You\", clearly, and so was the grace and the melodic-ness of the song. Then it's as if those qualities was slapped on top of a \"Diva\"-esque loop and out came \"Shampoo\". They're moving forward stylistically, but they're taking the qualities that defined their musical identity - I'll give them that.\n\nThat said, the melody is gorgeous, if I may say so, but it makes me worry if they will be able to pull this off live because I absolutely hated the fact that \"Because of You\" was so gorgeous recorded but was a mess live. The crisp beats at the beginning and throughout the song make it nice and clean, and dynamics, although pretty predictable if you can count from 1 to 8 in tempo, very clear and sure. The chorus seems like a mess, with everything running around, but it organizes itself in the end, and it's actually kinda nifty how everything gets resolved. The intro was a little too long for me - almost a minute? When I first heard the song I was confused whether I was listening to the single or the instrumental. As a whole it sounds like something straight out of a 2011 Disney teenage princess\/popstar movie that's all about dreams coming true and whatnot.\n\nSo now that you slap BCOY on top of \"Diva\" and add a few things here and there, you'd think that it would be the ultimate After School song to end all After School songs. I will tell you now that it isn't, because it lacks the one quality that set After School apart from groups of their generation. I said that \"Shampoo\" sounds like a cross between their previous singles, and some of the individual elements are pretty, but I didn't finish the sentence just yet. \"Shampoo\" sounds like those 3 singles put together, after you suck all the life out of them.\n\nLike I said a while ago, the song is very clean - but it's a little too clean. The song is princess-pretty - but it's a little too pretty. And this time, there's nothing to add that bit of punch that's crucial to their songs.\n\nWhat happened to the intensity and emotion that made them the band they were? Even when they jumped from \"Ah!\" to \"Because Of You\" the song had intensity and a sense of urgency - it had kick. I'll tell you what happened - they mixed the wrong elements together. You're forgetting that it's not the piano line that made \"Because of You\" angst-y, and it's not the fancy loops that made \"Ah!\" convincing - it was the strong drum+bass lines. When you listen to the songs at max volume you will literally feel your hearth thumping. Pretty hard.\n\nAnother possible factor is the shift in lead vocalists, which I am completely against. If they were giving majority of the singing parts to people who could actually out sing everyone else but were new I'd have nothing against it. But you give Nana and Raina a lot of the solo parts? Seriously? They can sing, they've learned, but there are better, more practiced and more stable singers in After School - give them the attention they deserve.\n\nAnother issue with the vocals is the way they were processed. The processing made their vocals far too clean, too sanitary, and too lifeless. No emotion, no intensity - in other words, dead vocals.\n\nYou know, I tried listening to the song at max volume after I was let down, thinking maybe that will solve things. I felt nothing. No thumping, no goosebumps, no nothing - I heard, but I didn't feel. If there's one phrase from me that I want you guys to take seriously, it's that music is half-heard, yes, but it's also half-felt. Technique and musicality are vital, of course, but what you feel when you listen to the technicalities is just as important. Music is art because it comes from people - who can think, but who can also feel.\n\nYeah sure the melody's pretty, the dynamics are neat, and they've grown musically, but there's no life to them. They can ALL do better than this - we've all seen them do just that - so why settle for dullness? Here's hoping my \"it's the processing\" theory is right. If it is, this will sound epic performed live, I tell you - if they can pull it off properly, that is.\n\n1 comments:\n\nTo be honest I am very underwhelmed by their song. It's catchy and I can see myself listening to this alot but I expected more from them. I don't know if they intentionally went for this \"softer\" sound or Daishi dance gave them this song and they just said \"Ok, we'll use this track!\". I hope the MV and live performance helps the song because alone as it is Shampoo is kinda weak"}
{"text":"chushi \/\/ V0SLF\n\nI might not always understand what chushi is doing, but I'm always fascinated by it. In truth, I don't even know anything at all about whoever is behind this. So, chushi if you're out there hit me up because I'd love to know.\n\nAnyways, here is their latest entitled V0SLF. The SLF part of that stands for Seven Legged Face, a label that is just as mysterious. The whole release is around three minutes long and it plays pretty much straight through, so it's basically pointless for me to choose just one \"track\" to share. But alas, it seems that I've done just that.\n\nIf you're familiar with what chushi does, then you'll know that they specialize amorphous blobs of dissonant and ambient noise. And as time goes on it seems that the tracks not only get shorter but they also shy farther and farther away from convention. It might sound like I'm being negative, but all of this is what makes the music so alluring to me. I'm fascinated by the trajectory of these releases and I'm always anticipating what is coming next.

{"text":"Her Name is Calla are not an easy band to listening to. They won't soothe you when you have a broken heart, lift your spirits when you've got the blues or accompany you on your Sunday afternoon stroll. They occupy another realm of our lives, the part most like to hide behind wide-eyed smiles.\n\nSince their formation in 2004, Her Name is Calla have created eerie, experimental, and enthralling music. Their mini-album 'The Heritage' was released in 2008 to critical acclaim (in certain circles) and features slow-building instrumentals, lamenting vocals and ominous imagery designed to captivate you throughout its entirety.\n\nIn the midst of a new album and right after an European tour, front man Tom Morris found time to speak to Pennyblackmusic about the concept of their new album 'The Quiet Lamb', the dark times around him that influenced the mini-album 'The Heritage', Her Name is Calla and his desire to score films in the future.\n\nPB: Her Name is Calla has grown over the last couple of years. How did that come about and how were the new members added on or integrated?\n\nTM: Basically our old drummer played trumpet when he wasn't playing drums. When we parted ways with him we still wanted the trumpet element so we got in touch with our friend. Sophie Barnes, who we'd met through gigging. During the recording of 'The Heritage' we started to expand our sound a little more with strings and wanted this to be represented live so we had Sophie Green join us on violin. It seems that the rest of us guys in the band started to play more instruments as well. We pretty much write a song, and then decide what instrumentation would sound good on it.\n\nPB: The music of 'The Heritage', coupled with the artwork, makes for a certainly brooding album. Is that something you wanted to achieve or did that evolve during the recording process?\n\nTM: It didn't really start as an album. It was supposed to be a single. But it was during its recording that we parted ways with our old drummer. We didn't really know what we were doing anymore. I started to go into some kind of downward spiral and generally broke down. All the time we just carried on with recording as new songs like 'Motherfucker\u2026' and 'Wren' started to materialise. It wasn't the happiest time in my life at all.\n\nPB: I read that the song, 'New England' from that album,was once a 30 minute song. Do you find it restrictive or exciting to edit your work so it fits into the conventions of how long a song should or can be?\n\nTM: I don't think there are any restrictions that we face really other than ability to pull off what we want to achieve. We try to progress as musicians as much as we can and our main goal is to continually push each other and ourselves. We only think in terms of what is best for the songs. If cutting them down or building them up helps that then so be it. I guess we're quite selfish musicians in that way. I find it strange that people should think that a song should be a specific length. I'd quite happily release a song that was a minute or even 90 minutes if it felt that it was right. Songs for us never stop evolving. Some of our songs that have been released are played much differently live.\n\nPB: I'm really curious how your composition process works, with seven people in the group. Is there a lead songwriter who hashes up an idea and then everyone else adds to it or is it process for the whole group?\n\nTM: It's normally me that writes a song or a kind of half song. We then all build on the ideas until we reach something that we're happy with. Some songs take a lot longer than others. I think songs like 'Nylon' and 'New England' had been banded about for years and years until we finally settled on something that we were happy with. It's not always a long process though. It is made much harder by us all living far away from each other though.\n\nPB: 'The Quiet Lamb' is the name of your forthcoming first full-length album. Is there a concept for this album? Will it see Her Name is Calla treading new ground?\n\nIn retrospect, I consider 'The Heritage' our first album. Even though we call it mini. 'The Quiet Lamb' is quite a bit different in the state we have it at the moment. It's hard to describe but there's instantly a lot more melody and harmony involved and it's quite sparse in some places. Saying that, some parts of it become very dense and claustrophobic. I'm trying to make the concept behind the album more apparent this time, as with our first record it was maybe a little vague. It is intended to be a direct follow on from 'The Heritage' though and has some interlinking moments. I hope at least some of that makes sense.\n\nPB: How are you getting on with the recording process and when will you be releasing 'The Quiet Lamb'?\n\nTM: We hope to have it finished by Christmas and then out by March or April alongside a single and a European tour. It's tough going as everyone has such busy lives, but I'm confident that we are on track.\n\nPB: 'The Heritage' was well received. Was it a conscious decision to release a mini-album to reduce the pressures of a debut album, sort of like testing the water?\n\nTM: I think that may have been the idea at the time, but in retrospect we sort of just consider it our first record. We change our minds a lot. It did get some pretty good reviews and that did however give us the confidence to continue as a band.\n\nPB: In a 'Drowned in Sound' interview, you described yourselves as a \"thinking band\". What does that mean and how does it separate you from other post-rock outfits?\n\nTM: I have no idea what we meant by that. Maybe we were drunk. It's a high possibility. I don't think we really consider ourselves post rock so I don't know how to separate us from them. Maybe it's because we spend so much time putting together our music and what we want to achieve with it. The biggest challenge I feel that we face is time. There's never enough time to spend on music.\n\nPB: I found that the imagery of 'The Heritage' were similar to a Guillermo del Toro film; dark, ominous, haunting with no cheap thrills. Would Her Name is Calla consider scoring films in the future? 'New England' was the centrepiece for a DVD by Broken Pixel and was certainly is a nod in that direction.\n\nTM: Oh God, definitely. We've always wanted to do something like that. Ashley who is Broken Pixel is making a new film that is adaption of a Hans Christian Andersen story called 'The Tinderbox'. I'm doing the score for that. It's a full-length adaption and the first time I've done something specifically for film. I'm glad you picked up on the imagery of the album though. A of time was spent trying to create a feeling and a setting in the music.\n\nPB: How did the partnership with Broken Pixel come about? Aas well as the 'New England' video, you have already done the 'A Blood Promise' DVD with him?\n\nTM: Broken Pixel is Ashley Dean who used to play in iLiKETRAiNS. We'd toured with them and Ash came up for the concept in about 2007 when we were on tour. 'A Blood Promise' was meant to demo some new songs from the album as well as host Ash's video and lots of footage that we had gathered up until the point. Though now we have about a further ten live shows videoed, recording from our recent tour and about 30GB of photos!"}
{"text":"-Are you a bespeckled, socially maladroit, ambitious young guitar wielder out to inspire the world into peaceful protest?\n\n-Jealous of all the airplay given to that Pump Up the Fostered Kicks song?\n\n-Want to be name-dropped by clueless hipsters everywhere?\n\nThen stop staring at your shoegaze pedals on the floor, because this is the guide for you! With their sophomore album Nootropics, inconspicuous indie pop group Lower Dens has provided you a perfect model for an Individual Artistic Statement. You and all your friends can be unique in your quest to win the hearts of fashionable Spin critics everywhere!\n\nIf at any point you become sidetracked in your journey to release your own free-spirited piece of indie art, do not fear. Consult these tips and soon you will have every reviewer inventing contrived genre names for your record:\n\nPick an obscure album title and cover. This is the first and certainly the most important step to creating your indie pop album, as it will provide fodder for lots of trendy post-modern talk about its themes. In their example, Lower Dens chose the term given to pharmaceuticals that enhance cognitive function for a name, and for their image, a black-and-white collage of a city street, a living room and some kind of dog. Hmm...the malaise of the times as seen by the common man! Five stars.\n\nFollow the instrumental recipe. The second, somewhat important point of decision is how to structure your songs. Nifty things have been done with the tried-and-true guitar, bass, drums and keyboards format, but innovation is not the goal here. The indie pop formula baked to perfection in Nootropics involves an army of spacey synthesizers, layered under droning female vocalizing. Let the bass and drums do whatever they want (see \"Lamb\" for reference.)\n\nIf you insist on a variation, try starting with repetitive drums and one-note bass, followed by a synth loop and a guitar that plays one chord every couple of measures. Keep the singing drone-like (\"Alphabet Song\"). Rinse, lather, repeat.\n\nBe sure to throw in a couple of exceptions to disguise the pattern. Lower Dens did this by including a more forceful upbeat song (\"Candy\") and a song with a recognizable vocal melody (\"Nova Anthem\").\n\nDon't worry about lyrics. More than likely, your keyboard player's ego will cover up the vocals, so feel free to improvise words at will.\n\nDon't worry about hooks. Melodies are for sellouts. You, on the other hand, are an auteur with a creative mind. Just let the vibe of your artistic presence grace the whole album, individual songs don't need to be distinct from one another. You're bound to come up with a creative blend of notes and keyboard tones by accident at some point, like Lower Dens did on \"In the End is the Beginning.\" Then, feel free to use it to fill time for 12 minutes like they did.\n\nDon't sleep the night before recording. That way, everyone will have that much sought-after lethargic feel to their performances. This is especially vital for your singer. A general aura of apathy is key to proving your alt-rock credibility.\n\nDon't tell your guitar player you're making an album. Write all the songs without his knowledge, then inform him as soon as you're in the mixing process. That way, his input can be limited to overdubs and small solos here and there instead of getting in the way of the dreamy feel of a good indie pop album.\n\nThrow in bits of random conceptualization. This goes hand in hand with the purpose of the album title and cover. Some kind of esoteric song linking is needed to display the adequate amounts of pretension. For example, Lower Dens named the second song on Nootropics \"Brains,\" followed by a direct segue into a short instrumental entitled \"Stem.\" \"Brains\" + \"Stem\" = \"Brainstem!\" Brilliant! Not sure what this has to do with anything, but brilliant anyway!\n\nOr for a less subtle example, see \"Lion in Winter, Pt. 1\" and \"Lion in Winter, Pt. 2.\" Part one is an atmospheric synth instrumental with lots of spacey wobbling. Part two is a bouncy new-wave dance song. Do these deserve to have the same name? What is their connection with each other? What does this all have to do with a lion in winter? All questions to be interpreted by your admiring critics.\n\nWith these tricks, you should be well on your way to becoming the hippest, freshest addition to the indie pop scene. Just be sure to change your keyboard sounds with every new album so Pitchfork can praise you for artistic growth."}

Murder Me? had a big influence on the no-wave and white-noise movements. A close encounter with Von Lmo is always perplexing -- is he a savvy Devo-like myth-maker or an acid casualty? You be the judge.\n\nQ: Is this tour part of a comeback scheme?\nA: Actually, I'm making a forward line drive into the future, and making a comeback from the future into the present. According to human theory, that is a comeback, but I've been hovering in this reality since 1991. Before that, I was in suspended animation for 10 years.\n\nQ: What is the concept behind your new record, Red Resistor?\nA: Physics is the theme, and Albert Einstein is the concept. I juggled around with some formulas and created a new theory of electric guitar, a very evolutionary -- I should say revolutionary theory -- about playing in 10 dimensions: being able to play in 10 different directions and do 10 different things at once. You have to smash the atoms not visible to the human eye as they get in your way. It's about blowing out all the circuit breakers in the house, and in the house next door -- that's how you know you succeeded.

One survivor is left who creates a new civilization of half aliens and half humans. It's an invisible movie, whatever you \"see\" when you hear the CD.\n\nQ: Explain your slogan \"Advance Yourself!\"\nA: It's very important. It means you have to get in touch with the universe, and realize that what I'm in touch with -- lights, the quantum particles, plants, the human race -- all comes together from vibrations of sound. Once you think of yourself as something actually floating around, you can get rid of the negative and concentrate on the positive. I've created an entire formula for a person to take a step into advancement with each one of my songs. You could actually say my CDs come with instructions.

{"text":"As a genre, smooth jazz often gets a bad rap. Sometimes that's deserved: much of what gets played on radio or promoted heavily elsewhere is more about the business than the artistry of music. Creativity takes a back seat to the idea that one has to fit into the mold. Once in a while an artist comes along who delivers music that's textbook smooth\u2014and it may even include such gimmicks as catchy beats and programmed rhythm tracks\u2014yet it still sounds fresh and original.\n\nEnter Keith Newton, a web developer, technical support consultant, and musician. His self-produced debut, Feelin' Groovy, has all the ingredients for musical disaster: drum and bass synths, romantic melodies, and ten songs that fit neatly into the radio-friendly range of three and a half to under five minutes. Yet Newton goes beyond the tried and true. Handling all the instrumentation himself, with some supporting vocals on \"You Should Be My Girlfriend and \"My Song, he avoids the clich\u00e9s and pitfalls that make so much smooth jazz mundane and uninspiring.\n\nFirst off, the programming is subtle. Rather than a static bass line or drums and cymbals that sound more like someone scratching sandpaper and tapping a glass with a spoon than real instruments, elements that tend to distract from the exceptional leads of such players as flutist Alexander Zonjic or saxman Walter Beasley, Newton's programs complement his musicianship. At times, they sound close enough to the real thing that it doesn't matter; elsewhere, they're understated enough to allow the listener to remain focused on the sax or enjoy the overall sound.\n\nFurther, the songs are a combination of laid-back grooves, funk-inspired rhythms, and overall elegance. Make no mistake: Newton is unabashed in his attempt to capitalize on the sultry, sexy mentality that is so prevalent in the production and marketing of smooth jazz. What's different is those charactierstics actually fit this album\u2014especially on \"Jill, How Do You Like Me Now?, \"You Should Be My Girlfriend, \"All I Need Is You ..., and one that would be a shoo-in if song titles were eligible for awards: \"Ooh You (The Bubble Bath Song). If nothing else, it proves Newton has a sense of humor.\n\nFeelin' Groovy is an excellent recording debut. The music is appropriate for many situations, including a country drive, just chillin', and, of course, getting romantic. With a sound reminiscent of contemporary sax players like Kirk Whalum, Eric Marienthal, and Boney James, Newton is poised for a promising career."}
{"text":"ANGLEFOOT \/ ILL-EGO: Split: 7\"\nA 45 split between the acoustic alter egos of Milemarker members Timothy Remis and Al Burian. Remis is Tanglefoot and he does two country songs: one acapella, one with guitar and banjo. It sounds nice, but the second song gets repetitive and the lyrics start to reek of an indie guy trying to \"capture the quiet desperation of the common man.\" Burian is Ill-Ego, which I initially misread as \"Lil' Ego,\" and hoped for a hip hop parody. I was wrong. His wordy song twists and meanders like an anxious Robyn Hitchcock, glued together by proto-metal riffs, and there's even a breakdown in the psychological sense of the word. It sounds like early Black Sabbath, if Ozzy was really and truly flipping out.

{"text":"So she's either very good, or she's the party bore who goes on and on about their celebrity connections and how tiring it is being so famous and popular. Happily Ms Wasser, with her rhythm section metamorphosising into Joan As Police Woman, confirms she has something of her own to say and the tools with which to articulate it.\n\nThe Ride EP consists of four tracks that offer a taster of debut solo album Real Life. They're not as immediate as the works of Rufus or Antony, but have that insidious manner about them that lets them burrow into the brain and set up shop there nonetheless if one is not on guard.\n\nThe Ride is a starkly melancholic piece that would work in a jazz cellar with a smoke machine and red wine on tap, with an unhurried gait and keyboards setting off her breathy, half-asleep vocals that have drawn comparisons with Chrissy Hynde and Dusty Springfield. It sounds as though it might've been recorded live. Real Life - the buried highlight of the EP - sounds like a Rufus out-take with a different vocalist, while Eternal Flame (nothing to do with The Bangles) informs us that she can't be the lighter of the flame in question. And, lest it be forgotten that she knows Antony, he pops up for a warbling duet on I Defy.\n\nA wistfully diverting ride, all told, from a woman with a taste for talented friends."}
{"text":"CaveNeverendless\n\nThe process of paring-away can reveal the power of purity and simplicity in music, or it can reveal the essential flimsiness of a band's entire approach. Cave's LP Neverendless mostly does the former, with just a smidgen of the latter. The Chicago quartet's early records\u2014especially the near-perfect Psychic Psummer\u2014called back to early-'70s art-rock, emphasizing rhythm and psychedelic fuzz. Neverendless is heavier, groovier, and much less eclectic. The album's five songs stretch and build, but the prevailing method here is repetition of riffs and beats for minutes on end, creating a sound halfway between hypnotic drone and sweet tension. Sometimes these songs\u2014nearly all instrumental\u2014sound like overtures for the epic rock album that Cave is disinclined to make. But the advantage of Neverendless' approach is that when Cave breaks from intricate pattern-making and just rocks out, arena-style (as on the album-opener, \"WUJ\") the moment of release is all the more satisfying because of the long wait. And when Cave steps on the gas and keeps driving forward on the 14-minute \"This Is The Best,\" the sense of infinite open space is awe-inspiring."}
{"text":"I first heard of Snowden about a year or so ago while listening to some internet radio site. The song was \"Kill the Power\" - a moody yet danceable, instantly catchy post-punk number - and I was hooked. Further investigation led to the Atlanta-based band's Web site ( where I found the entire self-titled EP made available for free download. Fuzzy guitars, driving beats, thumping bass lines and a droning voice combined for an intriguing first listen that just begged to be expounded upon.\n\nThankfully, the four-piece soon followed up with Anti-Anti, their debut full-length available on Jade Tree. The 12-song disc is a dance-happy meets cool gloom blur of smoke and fuzzed-out melodies, powerful and thought provoking lyrics and flat-out strong song writing.\n\nJordan Jeffares, vocalist and main brain behind Snowden was kind enough to take time away from touring, marketing and setting up the release of Anti-Anti in order to answer a few of my inquiries via e-mail. Here's what we discussed:\n\nSo first, the boring, typical \u2013 How did you all come together? How long has Snowden been around? Did you have any common interests that led you to form a band, etc.?\n\nThe band began when I was graduating from college in 2003. I'd been working on songs for years but only at that point did they ever get to anything decent. My brother helped me meet up with the first line up. We played for a year under that line up before vacation time started to run out for some of the guys so the line up changed to its current state the summer of 2004. I met Dave (Payne, guitar) through our first drummer and bassist. They were all jamming in a practice space.\n\nWhen the other guys ran out of vacation time, Chandler (Rentz, drums) had gotten wind that we were looking for a drummer from other people in the local Atlanta scene. A friend in Austin turned me onto Corinne (Lee, bass).\n\nAnd of course the dreaded \"How would you explain your sound?\" question. What are you trying to do with your music? Where are you now musically, and where would you like to go in the future?\n\nI'm trying to stay flexible and open to my view of Snowden and where it's going or been. There have been periods, especially in the very beginning of the band where I was trying really hard to make the music really different and it ended up making things too complicated. I constantly feel like good music is innovative, and since I want to make good music, I feel like I should always innovate.\n\nI feel like I've finally found a style but I'm very wary of even thinking of it that way because I don't want to lock myself into any paths. I don't want to have to worry about a song fitting on an album. I want every song to belong to itself.\n\nWhat are thoughts on \"rock 'n' roll\" right now, and how do you separate yourselves from other bands out there?\n\nThe line between indie rock and 'rock rock' used to be so clear, now there are 'indie' bands on major labels and bland rock bands on 'indie' labels. The terms that used to help you weed through music to get to the good stuff have fallen apart.\n\nThere's only so much you can do to try to separate yourselves. You try to do it with the music. Then we try to do it onstage every show. I used to be of the mindset that you should get on stage and let the music speak for itself, until one day we started going nuts and then people started responding like they never had before.\n\nWhat's your live performance like? What can fans expect to see when they check out Snowden?\n\nWe go nuts. We all stomp and jitter to the music. I have lots of nervous ticks that my brother always makes fun of. At the end of the show we're soaked through.\n\nIs there any message or theme behind your music? What do you hope people get out of hearing your stuff?\n\nThere are messages in every song, both introverted and extroverted. A lot of them are collages of situations or feelings. There are stories about places, disappointment, and revolution. I try to be dynamic with my lyrics. I never want to be a boring songwriter who writes about love all the time.\n\nWhat was it like writing and recording your EP? What are your thoughts about it?\n\nThe EP was a learning experience that should have been done better, but I'd only been doing music seriously for about 6 months at the time and there was no one looking out for us to make sure we didn't mess up. So, I did everything wrong. We worked with a horrible engineer who ruined the first attempt at it. Then I did the best I could mixing it with a friend from out of town and pressed it up, only so that I would remix it 8 months later and start giving it away for free through the website.\n\nI learned a lot from that EP. I learned not to rush things. I learned that an EP can be your ticket to bigger things if you can just wait and do it right and get people behind it instead of just trying to get something to sell at shows.\n\nYou decided to let people download the whole thing for free, how did that decision come about?\n\nIt just occurred to me that a band starting out has to give their music away, especially if they're unsigned\/unmanaged\/unconnected. The measly few grand that you could make off selling your music is nothing compared to the exposure you can get by giving it away. I tell all young bands to give away at least half of their songs if not more. Especially in the blog age, it's possible to do a blog campaign one week and have 50,000 people with your album on their hard drive\/ipod the next week. You give it away today so that 1) people can learn about you and 2) so that you can sell them your debut LP next year.\n\nYou recently signed with Jade Tree, how did that come about, and what is it like now working with label support? Did it make things easier\/harder when recording the full-length?\n\nJade Tree is about as indie as it gets. They're very responsive and active but we still decide on everything and do most stuff on our own. We have a publicist now, and college radio will get serviced, but we do our own Web design, our own recording, I'm booking the support tour right now, we do our merch, everything.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the full-length? How would you compare it to the EP? If someone takes one thing away from this album, what would you hope that to be?\n\nIt's more mature than the EP. Sonically, there's more space between things and I learned how to use my voice. Like the EP it's still moody. 8\/12 are upbeat and the other 4 on the record are my favorites, the slow stuff.\n\n\"Victim Card\" and \"Kill the Power\" are both songs on the EP which made the full-length as well. Was there anything particularly special about those two songs that helped them make the cut? Does it indicate what sort of direction you might be heading with your sound?\n\nThose are both songs that really characterize our sound. Those songs are where we are right now, no question. \"Victim Card\" was originally a slow song that I rewrote because we didn't have enough upbeat stuff for our first show. On the full length it's the slow version and we close almost every show with this version. \"Kill the Power\" most indicates the direction we're going. It's got that weird powerful rhythm and the distorted bass line and all that.\n\nWhat is next for you guys, and is there anything else in particular that you'd like people to read about?\n\nI want people to read about our European tour and how we're blowing up in Turkey and why hasn't America caught on yet?!?!"}

{"text":"Monday, June 15, 2009\n\nSunset Rubdown - Idiot Heart\n\nI'm reviewing Sunset Rubdown's new album, Dragonslayer, right now. I can't really say that I enjoy the album very much. It's much too abstract for me in ways... how the distorted guitar just kinda wanders off, how it doesn't always come together in clean, repeated melodies and patterns, how it just doesn't seem very mathematical. I suppose it's experimental. Wait, isn't experimental supposed to still be mathematical? I'm confused. I'm a big fan of Spencer Krug, and everything he does with Wolf Parade, but in Sunset Rubdown, his side project, he takes it a bit too far away from normalcy at times.\n\nThat being said, I can't really get over how much I really like a few songs on the album (\"Apollo and the Buffallo and Anna Anna Anna Oh!,\" \"Silver Moons\") and how much I LOVE \"Idiot Heart.\" So, basically, what I'm saying is buy this album for the first three songs.\n\n\"Idiot Heart\": dissect:\n\nThis song is just so, so cool. It starts with an echoey, muted guitar effect, jagged electric bursts, and some bare lyrics. But THEN, a barrage of bells and twinkles! Right as Krug proclaims \"Move around.\" Ok! They have me bouncing in my seat. Then the electric guitar gets proportionately more squiggly and creeps between all the chiming. And then Krug starts referencing Icarus (greek mythology: Icarus escaped Crete using wings made by his father but was killed when he flew too close to the sun and the wings melted). And Krug starts hyperventilating with whoa-oh-oh-oh's and repeated lyrical phrases like, \"look at you go.\" Enter string arrangements, along with a combo of bells and squawky guitar. It just grooves, it has my head bobbing. And the final line of the song makes no sense to me at all: \"I hope that you die in a decent pair of shoes. You got a lot more walking to do.\""}

{"text":"For an album that's been in the making for three and a half years, it's hard to not expect Kimbra's debut album, \"Vows\" to become an overly polished product and yes, it is polished, but the beauty, rawness and energy of her live performance still shines through. In fact, listening to the opening vocal percussions of \"Settle Down\", you can picture everything; from the way she moves to the sun going down at Meredith Music Festival.\n\nBut \"Vows\" goes a lot further than the opening song \u2013 the range and tone of Kimbra's voice takes this album to places that surpass the realms of a generic pop album. There's honesty that fills the corners and depth in the songwriting coming from a broader influence. It's not a party album as one would expect, but a jazz and soul infused piece of art that tells a delicate story.\n\nThe skills of Fran\u00e7ois T\u00e9taz (Bertie Blackman, Gotye) make their way to the surface in \"Good Intent\" and the Nina Simone cover \"Plain Gold Ring\" where the production is very much comparable to Gotye himself. (This would explain how at ease she seems in \"Somebody That I Used To Know\")\n\nA real beauty in this album comes from \"Wandering Limbs\", a duet with Melbourne musician, Sam Lawrence, which takes you on a journey of facing fears and riding a wave of spiritual elevation.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. Kimbra vulnerably finishes the album with \"The Build Up\" \u2013 a song that doesn't seem like much to start but pulls at your heartstrings in an unequivocal build up to a dramatic ending that leaves you wanting more.

{"text":"When Saints Go Machine - Danish Exit Strategy\n\nWith their set at this weekend's Exit Festival, Carlos Hawthorn spoke to When Saints Go Machine's Nikolaj Manuel Vonsild about Danish lullaby's, squeezing as much music as possible into live sets, and feeding on music.\n\nWhen Saints Go Machine You guys mentioned it was a dream come true to play at Sonar. Well, you just did it. How'd it go? We all think it went well. We felt each others presence on stage and the audience right there with us. Felt almost perfect.\n\nIt's been just over a year since you released the critically acclaimed Konkylie. How have the past 12 months been? What's been the newest and most exciting thing that's happened to you? Kind of busy, but nothing too crazy. We have been playing a lot of gigs, traveling and meeting a lot of wonderful people and partying a bit. I guess the latest most exciting thing for us is still playing at Sonar, but next week we will be going away to work on new material together and that's really big and hauntingly exciting.\n\nEthereal electro-pop seems to be a very popular Scandinavian export. What is it about life in the north, or Copenhagen specifically, that manages to produce this sound again and again so beautifully? I always find it really hard to answer that question. Could be our subconscious mind dealing with nature, but we may also have the long dark winters and Martin luther to thank for it.\n\nSince the success of Konkylie has it been at all hard to adjust to the pressures of being a much more in-demand and popular band, or has it just been one big party? Between the four of us we're always the hardest critics and that's kind of the only pressure we have to deal with and we're slowly learning. You can't ever really be sure about other peoples views. The important thing is that we stay inspired and keep having fun with what we're doing.\n\nWSGM are known for their memorable Live shows. What is your ethos when it comes to performing? Is there a lot of spontaneity and improvisation involved or are your sets pretty structured? Thank you so much I didn't know that. A bit of both actually. We're moving in and out of grid a lot, but our shows are mostly structured for the specific concerts we're playing, because the minutes are running and we want to play as much music as possible.\n\nObviously your English is fantastic but do you never feel the urge to write lyrics in your native language? There must be ways of expressing yourself and your emotions in Danish that don't exist in English. I have been writing songs for fifteen years or more now and I have only ever written one song in Danish so I don't know. The song was a lullaby, but I think it was a bit too much for the small ones. It ends with a woman breaking in half and her husband committing suicide, but I liked the song a lot. I have written a few poems in danish though, but they never really feel like songs to me.\n\nWhen you guys make music are you conscious of maintaining the balance between pop music and what could work in a club environment? We just do whatever we feel for at the time, but we never think about anything other than doing what's best for the song. If we all think it has some sort of special character or personality that makes us feel something it's always the road we choose to follow. Could be a straight up pop song, weird noisy music to dance to, silence or all of the above combined. Doesn't matter to us, but I guess it's lucky that our music sometimes work in different settings.\n\nYou said in an interview that you'd like to reinvent yourselves every time you release a record. Will that be the case with the next record? When can we expect to hear new music? We just released a new single called Mannequin so thats almost new, but other than that it's hard to say, we've got a lot of songs, but we need time to experiment and figure out how they're supposed to sound. It's never fun doing the same thing all over again. To us writing and producing is a learning process. short answer could be, making music is something that we feed of and we never really know when we're full. Anyway, hopefully soon."}

He would have been kind of dorky, smart, totally hilarious, have bad vision, a beard and be really into music. He and his friends would hang out in his room for days on end, writing music and talking about boy things like dragons and girls and Pink Floyd's Animals, just geeking out playing bass riffs.\n\nEssentially, my imaginary big brother and his friends would probably have been Akron\/Family, so S\/T II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT would probably have been their fifth (and coincidentally also their best) album.\n\nS\/T II is heavily influenced by \"Bent Acid Punk Diamond fuzz\" (honestly, who knows), underground Japanese noise, and the 70's drums Akron\/Family rebuilt themselves and play with their own sticks.

The album is all honey and chirpy and tribal drums and happy harmonies and fuzzy guitars (fans of Edward Sharpe and Animal Collective's potential love-child, listen UP). Some highlights: \"Light Emerges\" is a rolling, building stomp-stomp-clap with layers and layers of wide harmonies, \"So It Goes\" is a happy, gritty jam, \"A AAA O A WAY\" is just way too good and way too clever for regular folks. I can't find a song on this album I don't like. My big brother is so, so cool."}
{"text":"uppets are an integral part of the ongoing spectacle that is Quintron and Miss Pussycat, who make art rock with strings attached.\n\nRock bands and puppets: two peas in a pod, right? Sure, these art forms might seem contradictory on the surface. But on Friday at Opolis, the spectacle of Quintron and Miss Pussycat \u2014 half puppet show, half concert \u2014 will take this notion and obliterate it.\n\nThe New Orleans-based husband and wife bear a unique skill set: Quintron, aka Robert Rolston, is a beat maker, master of the organ and inquisitive inventor; Miss Pussycat, aka Panacea Theriac, is a longtime puppeteer and filmmaker.\n\nAccording to Theriac, who was born and raised in Antlers, the two aren't all that dissimilar.\n\n\"Puppets are just really good at being in bands,\"\n\nshe said. \"They're really good at playing guitar. They're good at killing each other, and they're good at kissing.\"\n\nIt wasn't long ago that she discovered the unique abilities of her puppets, and became so enamored with the concept that she founded the fictional puppet band Flossie and the Unicorns, who, Theriac said, \"released three albums and some singles.\"\n\nHer current project \u2014 the colorful, mind-bending film series Trixie and the Tree Trunks \u2014 takes her craft to a riotous new extreme. Their latest adventure, The Mystery in Old Bathbath, will be screened as part of Friday's show.\n\nYet it's the music that takes center stage, and Quintron assumes role of entertainer.\n\nLike her work, his tunes eschew traditional categorization. Organ-heavy grooves and heady percussion are Rolston's most trusted tools, employing a wide variety of sounds and eliciting an even wider range of emotions with his performance.\n\nBut Rolston isn't just a performer; he's an inventor, too. His most notable creation, the Drum Buddy, is a light-activated oscillating drum machine. His newest gadget, the Singing House, is a droning analog synthesizer with modulations that are dictated completely by the weather. Or, as Rolston described it, \"a robot that sits outside in the weather and sings a song to you in your house.\"\n\nUltimately, he strives to entertain, no matter who his audience is.\n\n\"I'm just an obsessive thinker,\" Rolston said. \"In New Orleans, we're a normal rock band, but in a lot of other places, we're the Chinese water ballet. Context is everything with music. It's very much a two-way street. I want open communication of any kind. I don't want to alienate or oppress any audience in any way.\""}

But if you give it a chance it is a real grower and is easily the best album I have heard this year. Here is a brief breakdown....\n\n1. It's Working - awesome, psychedelic tinged opener. Wouldn't be out of place on the second half of Oracular Spetacular.\n\n2. Song For Dan Treacy - One of my favorites. It's not traditional pop per say and probably won't be played on the radio, but is very melodic even without a typical chorus.\n\n3. Someone's Missing - The closest this album comes to a traditional single. Ends abruptly once the chorus kicks in at the end, but is still very good.\n\n4. Flash Delerium - This is the first \"single\" off the album and when I heard it my initial reaction was \"blah.\" But this song sounds so much better in the context of the entire album and is now my personal favorite off the album.\n\n5. I Found a Whistle - A nice, slow break proceeeding \"Flash Delerium.\" I imagine this will be the song that will cause the lighters and cell phones to come out during their concerts. Listen to the lyrics carefully. I assume the song is not referring to the \"Phantom Menace,\" but I wonder.....\n\n6. Siberian Breaks - This is probably the song that will determine if you like the album or not. At 12 minutes long it is one of those songs that people are going to love and hate. It is really like 4 or 5 songs thrown together, but for whatever reason it completely works and is the heart of this album.\n\n7. Brian Eno - An almost punk-type song dedicated to Brian Eno.... Not quite made for radio, but along with \"Someone's Missing,\" it is one of the catchiest songs on the album.\n\n8. Lady Dada's Nightmare - An instrumental and in my opinion the only mistep on the album. Not that it's bad, but it's not something you will want to listen to over and over and I would have much preferred a real, non-instrumental song, especially considering this is a short album at only 9 songs.\n\n9. Congratulations - Great way to close out the album with probably the most traditional song MGMT has ever recorded. It is obviously meant to be a sarcastic reaction to the fame brought on by Oracular Spetacular, but is one of the best songs on the album regardless.\n\nIn closing, my only complain is that at 9 songs the album feels more like an EP then a full album. But even so, it is still so much better then most of the other crap out there these days. Give this one a chance, realize going in it is not Oracular Spetacular, and I have a feeling you will not be dissapointedRead more \u203a\n\nMGMT founders, Benjamin Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden, were unceremoniously catapulted into fame with the release of Oracular Spectacular--a place that they didn't appear to comfortably occupy. The crowds of excessively adoring adolescents were perceived by the band as a pseudo-fan base. The darkly tinged lyrics of \"Time to Pretend\" and \"Kids\" seemed lost on the blithe crowds who quickly targeted the album as the latest, must-have fad. The result was a flurry of interviews and award show appearances for which the band appeared to be ill-suited. Therefore, for their second venture, they seem to have distanced themselves from the style that forced them into the limelight--a style that was simply one of many in their creative repertoire.\n\nWith Congratulations, MGMT has meticulously crafted a musical journey that meanders through various soundscapes and experiments with broad variations in tempo and style. Although the universal sentiment is one of introspection and disillusionment, it is not crowded with thoughts and messages of gloom. While it would be fitting to assert that the drifting guitar riffs and psychedelic instrumentals are reminiscent of such classic rock influences as Pink Floyd, it must also be affirmed that the band has maintained a sense of innovation and novelty. It's safe to assume that there are no top 40 hits on this album, but this was likely intentional. It seems that, on this outing, MGMT's artistic course was a direct reaction to the standards of the radio industry, as accessibility was not a consideration. After all, their intended audience is not the mainstream crowd that flocked to their previous release....\n\n\"Congratulations\" is one of those singular albums that needs to be experienced with an uninterrupted flow, as each track blends seamlessly into the next. While there are certainly stand out tracks, such as \"Someone's Missing\" and \"Flash Delirium,\" the remainder of the album should not be considered any less momentous. Despite the variations, both in the midst of songs and among tracks, they play off of each other in a manner that makes them all significant to the thesis. The album closes with the title track, which is configured of equal parts melodrama, dripping sarcasm, and antipathy. As alluded to in the lyrics, Goldwasser and VanWyngerden could have easily remained complacent in their overnight success. Instead, they chose to challenge their expansive audience to see which ones were really getting the message, and separate them from those who were simply there for the party.Read more \u203a\n\nIn Rolling Stone a few months back, I read that MGMT was going to release a new album soon, and my heart almost stopped. After falling in love with Oracular Spectacular, I couldn't wait to hear their second album. The weekend it first came in, I listened to Congratulations a total of 12 times the whole way through; it might sound somewhat obsessive, but I couldn't get over how much I liked it. Sure, it's hard to compare it to OS; there are some songs on the album that remind me of the first album (Someone's Missing, I Found a Whistle, Congratulations), but for the most part, it's quite the musical leap from their first. I was so proud of Andrew and Ben's decision to stray away from singles; the album is meant to be listened to the whole way through each time, the way albums are supposed to be. What a novel idea!\n\nAnd as far as the album cover? \"Well, people that are stupid don't understand it, but cool, smart people get how awesome it is.\" Andrew VanWyngarden, you sure have a way of explaining things.\n\nThe first time I heard MGMT's new album, I thought of the interviews they had to give on the red carpet of the last Grammys. If you didn't see it, it was as awkward as interviews can be and at the time, it was clear that the band didn't want nothing to do with these people. What we didn't know at the time was that their hostile attitude would actually shape their entire next album, Congratulations. The band had also announced that there would be no more `Kids' or `Time to Pretend' and as soon as `Flash Delirium' came out, it was pretty obvious what went through their minds in the studio: `this time, let's do something that the mainstream will NOT dig'. If only this album was good.\n\nThe main thing that strikes me about Congratulations is that it's not only reactionary, but closed to itself and borderline-adolescent. It finds MGMT focusing too hard on making less accessible music, less catchy pop songs and even though structures are more adventurous and as trippy and enjoyable as it may be on acid, it leaves the sober listener craving for a lot more substance. The childhood nostalgia that characterized Oracular Spectacular is pretty much gone and that's fine, but MGMT tries to escape it by pushing too hard towards psych-pop experimentation.\n\nIt's still listenable, though. `It's Working' and `Congratulations' are decent opener and closer and `Flash Delirium' is a blast. Some people complain that it's not a single, and I agree. That's why it's awesome. It's crazy, all over the place and it keeps becoming something else. Then, there's my favorite cut, 'I Found a Whistle', a short and beautiful song with a hypnotic melody and a spectacular finale.\n\nIt's a clear case of Secondalbum Syndrome: trying too hard to move too far from the identity that the first album gave you.... Anyway, an average MGMT album is still more refreshing than anything out there, so I'm happy. Yay!Read more \u203a"}
{"text":"Brooklyn-based Indie-rock band Candidate has labeled their music Dreamrock, a genre that they say, \"is a combination of post-punk and shoegaze with late '80's\/early '90's American indie and grunge and Britpop.\" Such a genre encompasses a lot, but, their music is even more expansive than their genre suggests. If Candidate fits the description of Dreamrock, then the genre is going to need a bit of work.\n\nIn many ways Candidate reflects the city that spawned them. Their music is a diverse mixture of echoed harmonies, distorted instrumentation, grungy guitar riffs, and synthesizer. They pick the portions of each genre they want to take from, and leave genre restrictions behind. For example, the music does have some noticeable grunge influences, but it has sweet melodies. While it takes on pop\/punk form with choppy and fast-paced rhythms, the synthesizer levels the music out. The concoction makes for enjoyable tracks that keep the listener on their toes.\n\n\"April Again\" provides the best example of the band's genre manipulation. They combine early Beatles psychedelia stuffed with 60s psychedelia painted neatly over an anachronistic guitar riff that comes into form after the verse. The chorus transforms the song into early 90\u2032s indie\/rock. It then hits back with psychedelia that this time is overshadowed by some repetitive electronic beats. But even with all of this going on the song is easy to listen to and equally enjoyable. It is a skillful track."}
{"text":"We get sent music here at the D and T on a regular basis; our desks heaving like Spanish bosoms with various promo materials from all sorts of artists.

{"text":"The Flaming Lips\n\nby Stuart Barr\n\n\"It takes us a long time to do our records, we\nusually just go into some bumfuck studio in the middle of nowhere and\nhole up for four or five months\"\n\nWayne Coyne is describing the trials and\ntribulations of life in the Flaming\nLips. I've been questioning him about\nthe weird and twisted rumours that have been circulating about his\nbands vile and depraved recording methods (vile and depraved by the\nmixing desk manual, muso types that is).\n\n\"I would think it's normal stuff that happens\nwhen people get together and basically go insane together. The\nprocess of making records is basically fucked up\" he adds reasonably,\nvoice crackling as it bounces off several satellites from Oklahoma to\nConvulsion Towers, Edinburgh. Ain't technology wonderful.\n\n\"We don't have anyone produce us, we basically\ndo it all ourselves. There isn't anyone there to guide it in any\nparticular direction.\" And thank god for that, The Flaming Lips latest\nalbum `Hit to Death in the Future\nHead', is a marvellously warped\ncollection of rough pop jewels. From the urgent throb of\n`Talking `Bout the Smiling Deathporn\nImmortality Blues (Everyone wants to live forever)', to the swirling five and a half minute epic\n`Halloween on the Barbary Coast', to the Neil Young-ish ballad\n`You have to be joking (Autopsy of the\nDevil's Brain)'. `Future Head' sprawls\nabout all over the place, but is rarely less than compelling\n(actually thats not quite true, the CD features thirty minutes of\nsheer sonic hell, that's like sonic water torture; but we'll deal\nwith that in due time). Anyway back to the vile and depraved\nrecording methods.\n\n\"Stuff happens sure. I remember playing guitar\nin a womens bathroom. We were at this music school , so you had\nwomen's and men's bathrooms, and long hallways. We had a guitar set\nup in the bathroom, and we where pouring water on it. We were\nshorting out the whole system while we were recording it. We were\nsplashing water onto this guitar, there was six inches of water on\nthe floor because we were gushing on this guitar, trying to get some\nnew innovative noise happening. Someone thought that there were girls\nbeing raped in the bathroom, we actually ended up being nearly\narrested.\"\n\nI suggest to Wayne (subtly) that being arrested\nwas the least that could have happened in roughly this form `Jesus\nChrist Wayne! You're lucky to be alive!' Over the phone I can\npractically hear him shrug in reply.\n\nWell it didn't seem that dangerous at the time,\nit's only a 100 watt amplifier. The worse that could happen would be\nthat you a buzz off of it. . .\n\n\"And that might be worth recording as well\", he\nadds with a flourish.\n\n\"It's not so much disgusting as a way of making\nthings more interesting for us, he says in a more sober vein. \"Just\nto play guitar with a wah-wah and some distortion on it, its hard to\ncreate interest in that. We try to go to extremes to make it\ninteresting to do. If it takes blowing up an amplifier to make it\nmake some noise that will have the kids all over America going `How\ndid you do that man?' then we'll do it.\n\n\"It goes further than writing songs and music,\nafter a while that can only take you so far.\"\n\n\"It's true, its all true. But I hope people\ndon't get the impression we played all those things. Bringing other\nso-called musicians in is our thing. I don't think all bands should\ndo that but sometimes we move away from just using guitar, bass, and\ndrums; and why not.\n\n\"You never know what's going to happen, thats\nwhat was so great about bringing in these sterile, hard, musicians.\nYou sit them in there and say `what would you do with this? Some just\nsit there and say `I dunno, you tell me what to play and I'll play\nit'. Others get really animated and come up with stuff that we'd\nnever come up with. We'd record them for an hour or two and then take\ntheir `bits' and turn them backwards, speed them up, or slow them\ndown and use them however we wanted. I don't know if its experimental\nit's more using sounds.\"\n\nThe lips hail from the not very rock and roll\ndull lands of Western America, Oklahoma. What's more they don't seem\noverly concerned with trekking to the states more trad musical\nmecca's. Why Wayne?\n\n\"We live here so it isn't strange to us. It's\nstrange to talk about it. It's been just a really depressing place\nfor a long time, the economy had folded before the rest of the\ncountry started noticing. People have been living here for the past\nten years on just lousy day jobs, and thinking that's reasonable. Its\njust so depressed here.\n\n\"But I think its helped in that, it's not\nbecome some sort of scene like Athens or Seattle. Bands from here go\nfor individuality, rather than for being part of a movement. You have\nto be brave to do that.\n\n\"There's bands here who would sound the way\nthey do regardless of anything else in the universe. That's sort of\nwhere we're coming from.\n\n\"Garth\nBrooks is from the fucking Ukon or\nsomewhere, and he sells millions of records, so it doesn't really\nmatter where you're from.\n\n\"It's like people who've been in concentration\ncamps, you ask them ` how could you survive on just bugs and water?'\nthey'll reply `I dunno, I just did it'.\"\n\nNice Analogy Wayne.\n\n\"In the UK music actually influences people on\nan everyday level, whereas here life goes on pretty much in the same\ndismal boring them regardless of what records are made. \"\n\nGreat, strike Oklahoma from my holiday\nlist.\n\nThe CD of `Future\nHead' features a 30 minute long,\nunlisted final track that merely amounts to two chords blacking out\nof left and right speakers over and over and over again. Do you enjoy\nfreaking people out Wayne?\n\n\"(Laughs), We had this piece that was coming\ndown to just a bunch of annoying noise. It was our way of getting\nback at bands who have then great songs, and because CD's are 71\nminutes long, they fill up the space just so you feel you're getting\nyour money's worth.\n\n\"I don't know about anyone else, but I would\nrather have ten good songs and silence, then ten good songs and a few\nmore shitty ones. This is our way of saying, look here's 71 minutes\nof sounds and ten songs that we think are worth hearing.\n\n\"If you don't want to listen to half an hour of\nnoise bouncing back and forth on your stereo fine, but we're not\ngoing to title it, and make it seem that it's important. We're just\nfilling up the CD.\"\n\nFlaming Lips\nmusic, and especially their lyrics seem to fall into the `Slacker'\nmindset that has become fashionable with certain more intellectual\nwriters in the US press recently (Hello Simon Reynolds!). For those\nwho don't know, the slacker lifestyle is summed up best in Richard\nLinkletters brilliant cult movie of the same name (see review\nelsewhere); which incidentally Wayne hasn't seen. Basically Slackers\nare educated, middle class, twenty something's; they're intelligent\nand full of ideas, but can't get it together to actually do anything\ncollectively apart from listen to slack er approved bands and discuss\nthe merits of Camp 70s kids TV (sound familiar? That nobody's got it\ntogether to examine UK slackerism yet amazes me. \"This week in MM -\nThe scene that just can't arsed!\")\n\nSome of the Lips lyrics fit the lifestyle (if\nits together enough to even call it that), like a glove. From the\ndaydream imagery of `Talking Bout the Smiling . . . .' which features the lines: `Man can only live in his\ndreams,', and `nobody ever gets it together', To the obsession with\nweird trivia evidenced on `Frogs'.\n\nI mention this to Wayne and he thinks its\ncool.\n\n\"A lot of records have come out in the last\ncouple of years - Like Lush and early\nLoop where\nit doesn't matter what the lyrics are. You can't tell what they're\nsaying anyway, it just becomes a blur. I really, really liked\nthat.\n\n\"I think some of my stuff veers along that path\neven if you can understand it.\n\n\"These days you can catch every amount of\ninformation floating around the world by sitting in front of the\ntelevision for a few days. With music, it's sometimes just the\nopposite, you're trying to destroy that information thats in your\nbrain. Half of it's pointless anyway. You want to put on something\nthat just going to destroy half your brain so you can start over\nagain. I hope our shit does something like that.\n\nIts hard to make definitive statements in a\nthree and a half minute pop song anyway, isn't it.\n\n\"Exactly, and that what's good about the whole\npop format. You have to be inventive within the format to pull it\noff. Rollins & Lydia\nLunch do extraordinarily well. Its like\nwatching a black and white film, there's nothing to get in your way.\nYou hear what they're saying, you know what they are saying, you walk\naway remembering what they said.\n\n\"Pop songs deals in so many abstracts,\nhopefully you walk away in a different frame of mind that you did\nearlier\"\n\nTell us about the song Frogs. Do the lyrics\nreally go \"Here you are; infected by the waterstrain wash your car\nfish and frogs come streaming down like rain\"?\n\n\"Yeah\"\n\nSo what gives?\n\n\"Have you ever heard Charles Fort? I have his\ncollected works here.\"\n\nIf you don't know who Charles Fort is, go buy a\ncopy of `Fortean Times'. basically he devoted most of his life to\ncollecting data on strange and unusual `natural' occurrences. Back to\nWayne.\n\n\"It's not so much the mystical aspects of it,\nits merely the way he put things across. The possibility of thinking\nshit that you've never thought before. Thinking stuff that's not\ngoing to logically sit in your head like other information as\nwell.\n\nI asked Wayne what his ideal artistic\naccomplishment would be. This is what he said.\n\n\"If I could, I'd spend five or six years making\na movie, and that would be it! It would have visuals, it would have\nmusic and you could go and watch it for two hours and come out\nknowing the secrets of the universe and knowing you're completely\nfucking insane.\n\n\"Or I would make a movie that would\nsubliminally tell all the fucking idiots of the world to go kill\nthemselves. As the movie would get released you would see the world\ngetting better, smarter.\n\n\"I get so sick of stupid people, people rating\nthe world, especially over here. It's just so ridiculous so\nthrowaway, and yet its the fucking idiots of the world that control\nwhat everybody else does.\n\nThe smart people of the world need to start\ndoing something.\n\n\"People are getting stupider. I hope there's a\ngrowing audience of people out there who want more than just going\ndown the grocers store and renting a video. Unfortunately it seems to\nbe going just the other way. My idea is to subliminally get those\nfucking idiots out there, to think that their lives are worthless and\njust kill themselves.\n\n\"You see how it wouldn't work though?, little\nby little your audience would cease to exist, your audience would die\nand you wouldn't sell many records."}

{"text":"Therapy? Interview\n\nThursday 7th of May 2009\n\nOver the course of 12 albums, Therapy? have managed to make rock records that ecompass and embrace the most unlikely influences and references. This ability to constantly transform and innovate is the reason the band has created so many unique and impressive records, but this is also the main critisism levelled at the band by the press.\n\nAndy: Every record we make will be different. We still listen to new stuff so it gets us into something else. Sometimes is would be easier to be a \"template based\" band, but as musicians we're restless.\n\nMichael: You can't be the same all the time because life changes you - and your records reflect that, they follow the peaks and troughs.\n\nAndy: We could have fallen into trad-alt-rock, but we took influence from jazz, hip-hop and dub-step drops. We've always been good at putting music we like into rock music.\n\nAnd the result of their attitude towards the music is their brilliant twelth album, Crooked Timber, which is a milestone record with big rhythms lined up against glimpses of their trademark elements from throughout their career.\n\nAndy: We wrote the whole album from scratch. There were no pre-conceived ideas before we started writing in the rehearsal room. We were all involved and it felt exciting, like it was a project.\n\nNeil: We came off of our German tour and we were listening to a lot of krautrock and the songs just tick along. We let that bleed into the songs. There's a confidence to the riffs, rather than lots of showboating. We resisted the temptation to keep on chipping away at the songs. If something sounded good, we used it and we didn't over-work it, We let it breathe. This is the first album I've walked away from that had ten complete songs.\n\nMichael: The whole album was a good project. There were stressful moments because we pushed ourselves. All three of us had a clear idea of this record so it didn't get watered down.\n\nAnd the ideas are still flowing - when questioned about the album, Andy was quoted saying \"it's a step in the right direction\". So with the creative juices still flowing, how does a three-piece that resides in Cambridge, Belfast and Derby keep writing?\n\nAndy: Michael and Neil send MP3s through and I send four-track cassettes back because I'm the old guy. It's good that we don't see each other too much because it keeps the excitement. We used to live within 300 yards of each other.\n\nMichael: When you're always around each other you don't have any individual stories. You can't tell everyone about somthing that happened because they were already there at the time.\n\nBut Crooked Timber wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been for the perseverance of the band.\n\nAndy: If we were ever going to give up, it would have been at the end of 2001. We had no record label and no drummer. Most bands would just jack it in, but we bumped into Neil at a Rival Schools gig. It was a real coincidence, but the timing was crucial. Because we already knew Neil, we didn't need to run auditions. Neil is a very talented drummer and he's also very open-minded. We didn't have to stem any ideas.\n\nTaking a year off was the best thing we did. We were touring so much that people were taking us for granted because they knew if they missed a show we'd be back again soon. We were thinking about releasing our 12th album and the gigs were only three-quarters full. Now we've been away for a while, people are excited to see us again.\n\nMicahel: We felt that we needed to break the cycle.\n\nAnd the decision seems to have paid off, not just in terms of the album, but also because of the current tour.\n\nAndy: We started in Malta and it was amazing. We thought we were going to be playing for 400 and there were actually 650. Newcastle and Glasgow both sold out and went ape. There's such a friendly atmosphere at the shows.\n\nMichael: After the tour we're playing a lot of festivals and then we'll be back on tour again.\n\nAndy: It's a nightmare selecting the songs. You can't please everyone. You can't play them all. We get a complaint every night because we've missed out a song that someone likes. Even in Malta someone asked for 'Meat Abstract' and we played so many songs we completely forgot about it. They came up to us afterwards and were really upset we hadn't played it.\n\nMicahel: We try to find the older songs that work with the current album. There are a lot of different sounds and tunings.\n\nFor a band that have been around so long, the outlook remains fresh. So how do they keep their outlook and sound so fresh...\n\nAndy: I'm in my 40's and I'm a father and a husband. You can't avoid that mid-life crisis unless you look at things as they really are. We're approaching our 20th year. It makes us sound old. We started last century, we didn't have mobile phones and we released everything on vinyl. The core is still the same, rock and roll and music will both survive - the changes are all progress. I still buy music and I buy MP3s. When cassette tapes came out, there was a big fuss about home-taping killing music so maybe some things don't change.\n\nSo Therapy? can look forward to some extensive touring, festival appearances and the release of 'Crooked Timber', the title track from the album on 18th May. There may also be something special in the pipeline for their anniversary celebration.\n\nAndy: Next year is our 20th anniversary so we'll have an extravaganza. A Therapy? panto maybe. The Gruffalo or Crooked Timber on ice."}
{"text":"Thursday, October 23, 2008\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I had the distinct pleasure of chatting with the iconic Randy Newman, who will be performing this evening at the Aladdin Theater. Due to the bitter struggle to get a giant two-page spread in the physical magazine, my rundown of all things Newman was shrunk to 350 words. Not that I'm angry about it; them's the breaks. But I'd be remiss if I didn't post a transcription of the entire interview here for all you blogger looky-loos to drool over. Or, for you over-50 ex-hippie washouts who may actually know what the Internet is. Or for my mother. Fine, fine; I'm posting this for my mother. But you can read it too. Enjoy!\n\nHarps and Angels came out in August. How do you see your songwriting and lyric writing progressing since your last release of new material about nine years ago? I think they're the best two records I ever made. And if they're not, they're close to it, for which I'm gratified; that at the age I am I can still write. That's not the norm in this business. Most people do their best work at 20 or 30. I'm arranging better and I think I'm singing better \u2013 that I'm positive of. I'm happy with both of them. Funny mix on Bad Love; sounds like there's a lid on it.\n\nAre you happier with the new one? The engineer is tremendous on the new one. I'd have to listen to Bad Love again., It's really hard to judge yourself. I know there's people who are always gonna love Sail Away and Good Old Boys because that was the time, but I don't like them better. I like these two better.\n\nIn the meantime you've put out a couple anthologies and film score work. Have the film scores been as satisfying for you creatively as your personal albums? No, not all in all because there'll be moments in the movies where we make a sound in the orchestra that you hope would really work well and it does and supports the scene. But it's always subordinate; it isn't like it's your movie. You always try to make someone appear smarter, more beautiful, the action tighter, things like that. That's what music can do. A lot of directors think it's cheating to use music, but it's not like you're supposed to notice it. The famous story attributed to my uncle is [with] Lifeboat with Alfred Hitchkock. It's just two people in a boat and my uncle's on the soundstage with 60, 70 guys and each guy says, \"Alfred, where does the music come from?\" And he says, \"It comes from the same place the cameras came from.\" So, there you are.\n\nFor over a year or so, the song \"A Few Words\" has been getting considerable attention. Are you concerned at all when the public clings on to one song like that, when they could be missing songs you may have invested more time in? It's been that way forever. Someone will have a hit single and that's it, and they'll buy the album and won't pay too much attention to other songs. Now it's even easier to do. You can get Lil Wayne and get one thing and you got what you want. But no, I don't care how they like it. I work as hard on each track, so it's not like, \"Oh, this is the hit,\" 'cause I don't know if I have any hits\u2026whatever that may be now. It's weird. It's really changed. Stores are gone, bookstores are gone; it's incredible. There's good things about it, but things get lost\u2026you forget. Things got lost when we left vinyl. It's such a pain in the ass that it's almost not worth it to listen to vinyl. I don't. What do you think about that?\n\nI have very few records. I got 'em I just don't play 'em. I tend to listen to CDs, and I tend to not download things. That's too big a decline. They are working hard to fix that. I'm hoping they will.\n\nTake a song like \"Political Science\" that's been around for over 30 years and still remains relevant. When you're writing a song are you searching for that timeless or prophetic element? No. You don't wanna rule yourself out. Maybe \"A Few Words\" will have a life just because it's funny. But I wouldn't count on having another administration to which it will apply. We've never had one, and this one's gonna go away. What if McCain wins? He's more like Bush than I thought the more I see of him. He reminds me of a little Irish bantamweight sometimes; an ex-fighter. Have you been watching the debates? What's been your take? I think Obama won that [first] debate. Somehow he doesn't have the fire he had, maybe that's the advice\u2026 The other one, she's [Palin] an insult to the people and in particular to the Republican Party. There's guys who've been there 30 years, and she may be a very nice person but you keep jerking things back to\u2026ya know, I hear myself talking like this and I think about Warren Beatty and all the nice liberals \u2014 Dustin Hoffman and Streissand \u2014 who, even though I believe exactly the same thing, I didn't listen to them. I wouldn't believe them if they told me the sky was blue, and now I'm doing it. It's amazing what happens when you get older. Anyway, I don't think she's equipped to be President of the United States. In fact, I would make a better president. And\u2026I was gonna say I know less than she does, but I don't think I do. And I'd be shitty as vice president! I'd rank down there with Lincoln's vice president, Johnson. Agnew. I hope someone would give me some money.\n\nI watched a television interview where you were discussing what you estimated your total number of Randy Newman fans in the world to be. The number was somewhere around 200,000. I'd imagine you'd like to reach as many people as possible. How do you go about doing that in your career, or are you at the point where that doesn't matter as much to you? It doesn't matter as much, because it's not gonna happen. I reach hundreds of millions of people with the movies, and with \"You've Got A Friend\" or whatever songs were in those. But for myself, it's not gonna happen. What's there is there, or left. I wouldn't change my writing to try and do it. I couldn't. Maybe if I did an album of love songs and they were good, songs like \"Feels Like Home,\" which people like, I'd pick up another 12,000. I'm all right with it, but I always wanted to sell records from the beginning, as weird as that sounds considering the type of stuff I did. Van Dyke [Parks, producer] and I were working in some session and we were real happy about some strange thing, and this guy says, \"You know, it sounds like you guys have never heard The Rolling Stones.\" We said, \"Christ, you're right!\" That was in the air then, like there would be another species of rock 'n' roll, that it would go in a different direction, but it didn't.\n\nYou do write from a character's point of view, and rarely if ever your own. How closely guarded is that approach for you? Harps and Angels could be me, if I believed in anything. I think it's closest the last two records. I take songs where I find them. How I started might have been some kind of reticence, but I would use anything from my life or anything about myself if I could get a song out of it. I did find it more interesting to make up these characters and let the audience hear what they had to say, and let the audience realize that they know more about the person than the person knows themselves. That's a big deal with songs like that \u2014 most of these people don't know themselves very well.\n\nAre you not concerned whether or not any sort of messages you're trying to get across are lost in that immediate reaction to the song? If you do it right, most people get it. Well, I don't know about most people, because they never hear it. People get irony now. The Simpsons is out there, so it's a better time for it, but it's not the best way to use the medium. If my son wanted to go into it, I'd say make it first-person. But I'm very happy and lucky that I've done as well as I have, considering it's like falling in love with the wrong woman. Short stories is nothing but that. It's not like there's a school of that kind of writing. Sometimes Neil Young does it, sometimes Dylan does it.\n\nAre those two people that you drew influence from at all? No, not going in this direction. That wasn't the main thing about Dylan, and I hadn't heard the Neil Young \"Union Man,\" songs like that where he plays dumber than he is. Dylan is the best lyricist this kind of music has ever had. Apparently in some paper I gave a disparaging quote or something, which I regret. But I mean, ya know, his first 10 years were better than his next 30. But, kind of, so what? Almost everyone's are. Not mine. Or Neil Young. [James] Taylor, too. And the writers who write for other people, the old standard writers. I mean Irving Berlin wrote hits from 1908-1954. I think if you're writing for yourself it's somehow hard to keep it going. And you were writing for other people when you started out, right? Yeah, but I was competing with people like Barry Mann and Carole King, and Bacharach and they were winning! Which one of your albums, even a film score, might you say you're most proud of and why? Either this one, in terms of records, or Faust. I haven't listened to Faust in a little while, but there's some stuff I'm very proud of on there. For the movies, music it's hard to say. The one I think I helped most was Bug's Life. It needed it. Toy Story 2 was pretty good too. And Awakenings; it was a lot of slow music, but it helped the picture. The Moore Theatre, is that where I'm playing or is that gone?\n\nYou're playing at the Aladdin Theater. My audiences up there really vary. I mean I've gone up there and bombed and drawn 400 people. And then drawn like 13, 14 [thousand].\n\nYou've lived in LA most of your life. How big an impact has Southern California culture had on your music, if any at all? I think it's had a big one. It's hard to explain; there's not that sort of jazz edge to me like there is to a lot of the top New York people. Carole King knew the whole repertoire, ya know, the Broadway hits and all that stuff, and I sort of did. I think living sort of wide open, where you can see a long way\u2026 Fagan and Beck are great writers. They sound like New York writers somehow. It's interesting. In ways I liked the Beach Boys better than the Beatles for a little while. All in all, I think I sound like an LA writer. I don't know how to explain it; Jackson Browne certainly is one. I don't know whether Henley is. He sounds like Texas trying to get in. \"Hotel California,\" like, \"you can never leave\u2026\" There's that weird mystic aura around it. To me it's just \"here it is.\""}
{"text":"12 April 2000\n\nNURSE WITH WOUND \u2013 \"Two Shaves And A Shine\" (from the LP An Awkward Pause)\nFollowing my trashing of Doves on grounds of length, you might reasonably ask whether I'd like any long rock song. Here's the answer. \"Two Shaves And A Shine\" is nine-and-a-half minutes, and electrifying.\n\nNurse aren't a rock band, which probably helps: what they do is put sounds together with more-or-less surrealist intent. To the listener for whom surrealism means replacing the punchline to a joke with the word \"fish\", or winkingly introducting 'weird' objects into ordinary pictures, a word of caution: Nurse With Wound records aren't like that. NWW go back to the roots of surrealism, to Breton and Lautreamont (who their first album swiped a title from). So what? you ask. So no two Nurse records sound the same, so they make music (\"Rock And Roll Station\") which sounds like trying to remember a dream feels, so they also make music (To The Quiet Men From A Tiny Girl) which feels like being trapped in shadow hospitals where all the doctors have pig heads.\n\nBut for these purposes, forget all that stuff. \"Two Shaves And A Shine\" is a long rock song. Except it's also ninety-three or so short rock songs, set on a six-second cycle, bouncing along on a spindly, bug-eyed bass riff. This radical fragmentation keeps the pace steady but also stops your attention slackening: compositionally: it's taking the common techno idea of minor variation over a steady beat and applying it to rock, with dynamic results. You get David Tibet's visionary ranting, then shrieking and scraping guitars and breakneck bouzouki. It's original and it grooves and it's got that air of deranged risk that you always imagined rock music should have: what more can one ask?"}
{"text":"MODERATORS\n\nsleepmakeswaves have had an amazing 2012, touring Europe and America, appearing at Dunk!festival, supporting numerous amazing bands in Australia (including Omar Lopez Rodriguez, Karnivool and are currently on tour with 65daysofstatic) and generally exhausting themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, it comes at a cost. I was actually shocked at quite how much of one though when I read an interview conducted by their bassist, Alex Wilson (in a half-serious, half-joking tone).\n\nNow I know there's so many bands out there that are trying to make it big. I know they've made themselves broke and maybe over-stretched if we look at it practically. But this is the band that I love and that I think can be amazing in the post-rock scene with their epic, triumphant sound and killer songwriting. They're giving everything to follow a dream and they are getting close to beginning to realise it.\n\nUnderground, instrumental music is a niche genre and market. But it's a goddamn beautiful niche and I'd like to think that we can support it. Sleepmakeswaves is my local band that I want to see succeed and it's ridiculously hard for any Australian band to do that, let alone weird genres like this. But they are on the path to doing just that, with many sacrifices. If we can help them overcome just some of those obstacles wouldn't that be fucking awesome?\n\nWhat can you do to help?\n\nIt's simple, buy stuff! If you've heard the band before on r\/postrock, youtube or anywhere and liked their sound, now would be a great time to get one of their CDs on your shelf or in your hard drive. Have a listen, if you haven't already and see if it's worth your money- \n\nCan't quite afford a full CD or got every piece of music already? You can use the \"name your price\" option on this EP to donate as much as you can afford-  (insert normal kitsch of 'if just everybody gave 50 cents\"). Plus you get some pretty awesome songs while you're at it ('we sing the body electric' in particular!).\n\nIf you're in Australia, go to one of their gigs. Post-rock is even better live and their sheer energy and stagemenship will blow you away. If you're in Europe or America, keep an eye out for their next tours!\n\nCan't afford to do any of the above? I know that feeling, as a broke university student myself... But you can still help, either by spreading this message or spreading word of the band.\n\nThank you for at least reading this and an even bigger thanks to those who've brought something!\n\nAs a general statement, don't just help sleepmakeswaves. And if you like another independent\/underground band more, buy from them! The real tl;dr should be that you should support whatever active bands you like.\n\nAlso, bandcamp is the best way to buy music that bands use, use it before you go to iTunes\/amazon if you can.\n\nfrom playing in different bands that have sold music on iTunes and Bandcamp - I can second that Bandcamp is a kick-ass service for musicians. They take 15% revenue on digital purchases opposed to 30% on iTunes purchases.\n\niTunes may be more accessible and a household name, but a couple things it can't do is let a small band put their album up for FREE, or free + the option to pay what you want.\n\nthe free + option to pay has proven to (in my personal experiences) to be much more beneficial as you get your music heard by literally anyone and people actually do pay for music when they put their own price on it. 15% is totally worth the service bandcamp provides. not to mention it is super lean and can run on almost any OS without additional software needed (iTunes, Apple product)\n\nIndeed, any local\/independent bands deserve support. It would be good if this subreddit was more open to lesser known names but it seems it's mainly just the big names that get the most attention when posted here...\n\nI just got back from the 65daysofstatic \/ sleepmakeswaves gig in Sydney and it was AMAZING. I'd highly encourage you to get out there and see the acts when they're in town - the venue was barely half full, such a waste!\n\nyeah this band is excellent. pleased they're making a name for themselves. already bought their albums, as everyone should. it really winds me up when people pirate from underground bands who have barely any money to their name. there's not really any excuse for it.\n\nfair point. i agree. it's just that when people use the excuse \"they make enough money as it is\" for their pirating, it doesn't hold up in the slightest when it comes to bands such as sleepmakeswaves. yet people still do it. but yeah, don't steal from any bands.\n\nI find this to be very distasteful. This isn't the bands equipment being stolen or anything unfortunate happening. This is just the life they have chosen. The same as any other band. The message should be much more general which is why I always try and promote Bandcamp links when people link to Youtube instead. Every band deals with this. For one specific band to beg seems to be in very poor taste.\n\nWell it's in poor taste from the fan then rather than the band. My overall point still applies: This is every band, not just them. Also this can potentially create bad press. Overzealous fans often hurt the things they are trying to help.\n\nThat's not what I'm referring to. A blog could easily take this the wrong way and go on a tangent about how bad it is to beg for money like this. All it takes is for a one or a few people to miss the message, think badly of it, etc, to turn this against the band when it's not the bands doing.\n\nA recent example would be Youtube fans who upvoted their favorites using illicit methods in an attempt to help out the person who uploaded the video. This caused the people who uploaded the videos to lose their ad-revenue on the videos since it was being gamed and Google found out.\n\nI find your response pretty distasteful too, to be equally blunt. I'm not begging for people to give them money, I'm asking for support for a band I happen to think is great by encouraging people to buy their music and laying out my reasons as to why I think people should support them. If people don't like the music, then they won't buy it. It's not calling for blind support of the band. If you don't think they're good enough reasons, fine. To call it in 'poor taste' for putting up a post encouraging people to support a band, not so fine.\n\nI agree that all bands should be supported (and I do try my best as a music reviewer and as an avid gig attendee to do that). But I felt the circumstances, of the band almost on the cusp of breaking into a far bigger league and having the handicap of being based in Australia when it comes to international touring, meant that I should draw attention to this band in particular.\n\nIt's extremely hard for an Australian band to do an international tour, given the huge distances they need to travel and the cost of flying internationally. It's not like Europe where you can use a van to get around the continent relatively inexpensively and the distance between countries is rather small compared to the trip from Australia. The cheapest return plane tickets are around $2000 to the UK (and that's before having to pay bulky luggage fees for guitars etc). It's very much a handicap for Australian bands and thus I believe it would be good if we supported a band that's taking on this barrier."}
{"text":"Review: Bon Jovi offers self-help, catchy choruses\n\nWhy does Bon Jovi crank out an unending string of relentlessly upbeat, unavoidably catchy songs in the style that made the Jersey boys famous 30 years ago and kept them there 'till now?\n\nBecause they can.\n\nThe band's 12th album, \"What About Now,\" fairly bursts with the encouraging self-help anthems that have long defined the Bon Jovi sound and style, from the early days of Tommy and Gina \"Livin' on a Prayer\" to keeping the faith and realizing \"It's My Life.\"\n\nOne listen to \"Because We Can\" and its chorus will be burned into your brain forever. It's one of many Bon Jovi odes to faithfulness, trust, perseverance and a belief that no matter how bad things get, it'll be OK as long as we hold on tight to each other and don't lose hope. Richie Sambora adds a harmonic guitar solo adapted from \"Capt. Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars\" from their 2000 album, \"Crush.\"\n\nThe title track literally sounds like a session with a self-help psychologist and it's a sure guarantee you'll hear this song blaring at Democratic presidential rallies in 2016.\n\nBut the most interesting is \"Room at the End of the World,\" where Bon Jovi sings of heaven as a calm, unhurried place where dead roses bloom again, where truth has its turn, where young love never dies, where there's no sin and \"where we never said goodbye"}
{"text":"Why do you think they like Canadians so much?\n\nPeople are just like, \"Oh, I love Canadian bands,\" like Purity Ring and Braids, and the history of Broken Social Scene and Arcade Fire. Everyone's super stoked on that stuff. I remember seeing Noah \"40\" Shebib when I was 15 at a folk festival -- he was doing this turntablism thing and now he's working with Drake. Stuff like that is very Toronto; these random, very post-modern one-of-a-kind artists who aren't part of any scene. Like F---ed Up, Crystal Castles, even Drake, they're all kind of anomalies within their own genre. I think that defines Toronto artists. I mean, I love indie rock, I'm just over it.\n\nSo is the Doldrums stuff in reaction to being over indie rock?\n\nIt's kind of about being over music in general. Originally, I wanted it to be music created in a void, where this fictional character has never heard anything and has no basis of reference for what he's doing. It's this childlike creative impulse that I know every artist feels, where you're confronted with your materials and you have no history of what they're used for. That kind of led me to see Doldrums as, 'F--- you, I'm not going to use guitars or any instruments. I'm just going to sit in a room and play drums.' And from there I started using more found sounds and incorporating more explosions, which led me to sampling and then the whole project became less conceptual and more music-based.\n\nWatch Doldrums Cover of Portishead's 'Chase the Tear'\n\nYour music feels childlike, why is that so important to you?\n\nSurely you remember these pivotal moments for yourself. When that first rush happens, it's in its purest, most altruistic state and the loss of that... I was in a rock band for so long and the fiction and reality start meeting in a very vague place where you're not sure what the culture means anymore. The childlike state is me sitting in a room with everything that's ever been made as materials and thinking how you can add to this huge pile of s--- that's built up. So what you do is you build a castle out of these pieces.\n\nOK, so a fort, like when you were a kid.\n\nYeah! It's very playful. I listen to music all the time and I still like to reference stuff through melody, but I don't want to get together with my bros and jam out a new song on the guitar. I find it hard to remove that from the context of its historical past. You can see it with jazz now; it's not an expression, you're presenting your take on this form.\n\nGoing back to the pivotal childhood moments, do you remember yours?\n\nMy dad's a musician and he's part of a really strong Canadian folk festival circuit. I learned to play guitar in these huge backstage jams, which are like 50 singer-songwriters playing the Weight. But the things that instilled this sense of self and wonder were two albums, which were my dad's, Radiohead's 'Kid A' and Bjork's 'Vespertine.'\n\nAre you a technophile?\n\nI've always liked how you can break certain elements of technology as creation. Just by improperly using music gear you can usually make more emotive music than by programming it correctly. When I was making videos last year, I was running all these VHS tapes through some broken video gear. The first Doldrums project was kind of multimedia; that's the thing I hope to keep doing again, when I finish this next bunch of songs.\n\nThere's some Bollywood samples on your stuff. Tell me about that.\n\nYeah, I love Bollywood music. My friend brought back some comps from New York of like '70s psych s--- and since I heard that I've been going to record stores and writing down the name of every world music psych comp I can find and going home and downloading them. Since then I've expanded into Turkish, Singaporean stuff. But late '60s-'70s stuff for sure, because after that it starts getting more accurate at replicating Western music. At first they were kind of getting it wrong, which was beautiful because you get these decontextualized interpretations.\n\nWhat's your next record going to sound like?\n\nI improvise a lot when I play live and I record myself live and I've built up just so many loops and little ideas and skeletons of songs and stuff. I'll probably end up using that in the final.\n\nPortishead were big believers in the perfection imperfection of those first takes...\n\nYeah, well that's what I was saying about happy accidents and breaking machines. These are both incidents where unpredictability and getting something wrong is what you like the most."}
{"text":"Description:\n\nN5's fourth album of 2005 finds the band continuing their unique blend of horrid vocals and time-wasting lyrics all set to good music. Considered a classic album back in its day, \"Go For It?\" has certainly been one-upped many a-times since then, but there are still some diamonds in the rough to be found.\n\n\"Licking the Floor Dry of Parnda Bears\" is a nearly-perfect track in the annals of ColdmaN5 history, a song that almost sounds like a song. Other standout tracks, for other reasons, include the bizarre \"Gloombing the Can of Sand Thomas\", \"Flarp\", and \"Dr. Da Da Do and the Widget Crackers\", the first track of the whole opus.\n\nAs with any other N5 album, there are purposeful moments of annoyance (such as the squirm-inducingly overlong 2-minute kazoo solo in \"On Another Kazoomikaze Mission\"), and some just plain horrible tracks (\"Ear-Hole Political Party Dance-Off\"; \"X Marks the Spot for Disco Jellophane\") that were included for no other reason than the fact the album needed fourteen tracks.\n\nBut without those \"trademarks\", how else could one tell it was a ColdmaN5 album?"}

Expectations were clearly high for the band to continue pushing the genre, and if you were to ask me, I'd say that their 2007 release delivered."}
{"text":"13. What is a good memory you have involving 33 (The Books)? The fact that my friend got me into them by telling me that I had gotten him into them through bands that I recommended to him. In terms of discovering music I'd love, he did all the heavy lifting and I got all the credit.\n\n14. What is your favorite song by 37 (Low)? Holy God, asking someone's favorite Low song is like asking which child they would sacrifice. I guess if I had to choose one it would be Dinosaur Act from Things We Lost In the Fire, mostly because it was the first song I heard by them and to this day I adore it ever bit as much as I did the first time I heard it, if not more.\n\n15. Is there a song by 19 (Mogwai) that makes you happy? Mogwai wrote happy songs? I don't know man, that's a tough sell. I guess if I had to choose one that made ME happy it would be Cody, Acid Food or Travel Is Dangerous, their songs with vocals tend to relax me and make me happy to an extent I guess.\n\n16. How many times have you seen 21 (Efterklang) live? Never, I have no idea how I would. It doesn't even seem like they're from this planet.\n\n18. What is your favorite album by 11 (A Northern Chorus)? It's hard to gage preference with ANC albums because they're all different from one another. If anything I would say Bitter Hands Resign because it plays more to my tastes. Longer, more spacey songs.\n\n19. Who is a favorite member of 1 (Epic45)? Well there's only two members of Epic45 and I don't know either of them personally, so this question is kind of unanswerable.\n\n20. Have you ever seen 14 (Stars of the Lid) live? No, but I would love to. I've always been curious as to how SoTL play live. You would think people would need to bring pillows and blankets because by the end of the show everyone would be asleep. I don't really know that ambient music is meant to be seen live.\n\n21. What is a good memory involving 45 (Belle and Sebastian)? I remember one day years back listening to Tigermilk while taking apart and cleaning my stove. I don't know why that would necessarily be a good memory, but there ya go.\n\n23. What is the first song you ever heard by 47 (Cat Power)? Definitely Good Woman. Still one of my favorites, though it kind of got overshadowed as I heard the rest of the You Are Free album.\n\n24. What is your favorite album by 36 (the squarewaves)? Jeez couldn't you ask about 35 instead? Squarewaves don't really release traditional albums, they release their music online in batches. So I don't really think there's an answer to that.\n\n27. What is your favorite lyric by 3 (Little Wings)? Who could choose a favorite Little Wings lyric? Everything Kyle Field writes is amazing,\n\n28. What is your favorite song by 2 (Do Make Say Think)? I don't know that it's easy to have a favorite Do Make Say Think song. Their albums kind of flow together perfectly. Though I've listened to Auberge Le Mouton Noir more than anything else.\n\n29. What was the first song you ever heard by 32 (m\u00fam)? Definitely We Have a Map of the Piano from Finally We Are No One. A friend of mine sent it to me years ago and I was like \"What in God's name am I listening to?\". Now it's my favorite song of theirs.\n\n30. What is your favorite song by 8 (Sigur R\u00f3s)? Again, that's like asking favorite children. Though I could probably get away with Svefn-g-englar.\n\n31. How many times have you seen 17 live (Rachel's)? Never. I don't get out much. I would love to see them though, live shows with classical string arrangements are always interesting.\n\n33. What is your favorite album by 12 (Earlimart)? Very easy question to answer. Treble & Tremble, far and above everything else they had done and have done since.\n\n34. What is the worst song by 34 (Elliott Smith)? I don't really know that Elliott Smith has a bad song. He's kind of hit and miss, though. Mostly his albums get you into his head space and you don't really think about the individual songs so much as the dude being good."}
{"text":"YOUNG OCEANS is a neo-alternative worship project that evolved from hymns penned and arranged within the Trinity Grace Church community in New York City, where an eclectic gathering of musicians and parishioners began exploring artful re-renderings of those songs in a SoHo apartment. Untethered from the expectations of a traditional congregational format, including both length and structure, a musical ethos emerged as more a companion to reflective prayer and meditation than to a typical church experience. Attendance at impromptu gatherings soon filled to overflowing, and led to the recording of a studio album that could be shared on a broader level."}

In an interview with NME, the musician divulged that his alcoholism was so crippling that it was common for him to ditch his band mates to work on their own when penning 2009\u2032s \"The Resistance. Finally, he had to make a very serious decision: \"die in a few years or stop.\" Thankfully, he chose the latter.\n\n\"The same happened to my dad, he was 40 when he died,\" Wolstenholme told NME. \"I'd just turned 30 and it was that realization that if I go the same way I could be dead in ten years.

{"text":"At one time, Columbus Ohio's Brainbow was the city's premiere post-rock, instrumental band. The group delivered slow-moving, acid-damaged guitar jams and wordless psychedelia that split the difference between Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, Earth, and Explosions In The Sky.\n\nThough they've been basically non-functioning for two years, the band is finally unveiling a gargantuan second ablum. II will be out on double vinyl as of Jan. 19\u2032s must-see release show at Ace of Cups, also featuring Columbus supergroups EYE and Connections. Ghettoblaster recently caught up with guitarist Chris Worth to talk about another album that is worth mentioning, Low's Secret Name.\n\nWhat is your favorite album?\nEverybody knows it's impossible to answer this, but there are a few that I always come back to and fall in love with again. Maybe Low's Secret Name?\n\nDo you remember when you received or purchased the album?\nWhen I was in college, we used to drive down to Columbus for band practice, and I must have gotten it then. I probably got it at Mag's or Used Kids, but I don't remember exactly when. I'd been falling asleep to The Curtain Hits the Cast a lot, and Secret Name was a very, very different record.\n\nWhat is your favorite song on the album?\n\"Starfire\", I think, although \"Will the Night\" is a close second.\n\nWhat is it about the song that resonates with you?\nEverything. It's a beautiful song. The sound of it is immense, but the arrangement is simple and economical. It just moves perfectly \u2014 it goes exactly where it should, and somehow Alan and Mimi manage to make the trick of having a male voice sing the high harmony to the lower female voice sound surprising every time. Chilling.\n\nHave you ever covered a song from the album?\nNot specifically, but like anything you get obsessed with, it creeps into whatever music you make.\n\nWhat is it about the album that makes it stand out against the band's other output?\nIt barely does, honestly. They're so consistently excellent. Probably just the pacing and sequencing. It feels like a tragedy to listen to the record piecemeal.\n\nHave you ever given a copy of this record to anyone? What were the circumstances?\nI think I make everybody I know listen to it at some point. Often very late at night. I don't think you can really listen to it passively. That's really important to me, actually. It doesn't force you to pay attention to it, but it doesn't reveal itself unless you do.\n\nWhich of the records that you've performed on is your favorite?\nBrainbow II. It's the closest thing to the record I've always wanted to make.\n\nWhat is your favorite song on the album and why?\nThis changes all the time. Right now it's \"Canyon for a Cradle,\" because I think we managed to get it to sound the most like how it sounds in my head."}
{"text":"The Decemberists and Wye Oak - The Greek - 08\/12\/2011\n\nIf there's one god awful concert tradition that needs to die of a combination of ebola AND bird flu, it's the ridiculous ritual in which the band prematurely ends an excellent set, dishonestly says 'goodnight' and 'thank you' and walks off the stage. At which point the crowd dutifully shouts 'more' or claps or whatever is required to 'convince' the band that the encore they have already committed to performing is in fact something they have only agreed to do because of the overwhelming crowd demand. It happens so often it feels about as spontaneous as an Easter Sunday mass. All it needs is the Bishop of Rock dispensing wine to make it officially predictable .\n\nI bring this up because The Decemberists' appearance at the Greek Theater (with openers Wye Oak) -- featuring music from their latest, The King Is Dead and a smattering of older material -- was excellent. Despite the fact that they still went ahead with the stupid encore ritual.\n\nThat was Jenn Wasner's late-set crowd banter, and despite the fact that it went over like a lead balloon, I laughed anyway. Also, I'd just watched Wye Oak rock the hell out of my ears. Their set was mostly material from their latest album, Civilian, with a smattering of songs from previous records. I hadn't given them much of a listen prior to seeing them live, but what was initially mild skepticism turned into John Birch Society level fervor by the end of their set. Yes, I mean that I am now a total reactionary wingnut, but for a band.\n\nThere are plenty of groups consisting of nothing more than a guitarist\/singer and a drummer, and they're often excellent. Somehow, however, I continue to be shocked. What stands out about Wye Oak is how minimalist they don't sound. Dummer Andy Stack banging on his drum kit one-handed, Rick Allen-style while fondling a keyboard, Jenn Wasner's guitar effects and gorgeous voice...There's not a lot going on but it feels like an army of musicians.\n\nMaybe it was frontloaded. The Greek Theater Hospitality Room (awesome, BTW), was piping an REM greatest hits album over the loudspeaker. That was probably due to REM's influence on the Decemberists' latest, but it was appropriate mood music for Wye Oak's droning, shoegazer sound, which is full of cascading minor chords straight out of 120 Minutes. And I mean the version hosted by Dave Kendall. Think My Bloody Valentine. Think Ride. Think The Spinanes or Dinosaur Jr. before they turned into a lame blues band.\n\nI don't mean to suggest that Wye Oak are a boring '90s retread - they're aren't - but that they've managed to capture the sweet spot between reliving the past and drawing from it. If you haven't seen them before, rectify that mistake as soon as you can.\n\nWe Recommend"}
{"text":"\/\n\n\/\n\nPremiere: Matthew Dear, You Put A Smell On Me (Breakbot Remix) MP3\n\nThe original \"You Put A Smell On Me\" is a twisted song, no explanation necessary, read the title. Repression, sadomasochism, Depeche-Mode-Nine-Inch-Nails: the Matthew Dear discourse is well worn territory. And as much as we're into that, hearing that this remix isn't is a major thrill. Breakbot pitches up Dear's monotonous growl nearly into R&B territory, doubling it with a helium-huffing backup singer. It's not creepy anymore, it's actually quite charming.

{"text":"Fred Avril - That Horse Must Be Starving\n\nAlbum Details\n\nThe Paris-based Fred Avril is a electro-pop musician that is making some very interesting and future looking pop music. I'm not sure how long he will be able to go by the name \"Avril\" because of the blossoming fame of Canadian Avril Lavigne but we'll see just how far he gets. As for his futuristic pop music, this should get him some well-deserved recognition. That Horse Must Be Starving has already won this year's Prix Constantin (the French version of the Mercury Prize). What's all the fuss about? Well, the music is left field, that's for sure. The album starts off with the spastic \"Double Mind\" that sounds like it should be on a Ninja Tune album. Then there are some tracks like \"Global Headphones\" that remind me of Grandaddy, the same sort of ethereal pop but hummable and immediately interesting. \"The Date\" is more along the lines of some of the electro-clash sounds we have heard recently from the likes of Ladytron. In his bio they state that Avril is something like a deranged synthesis of Serge Gainsbourg and Aphex Twin. This is indeed a correct analogy of Avril's music. It should be said that he sings in English and it sounds like it is quite easy for him. While That Horse Must Be Starving is not the sort of album that normally gets nominated for a prestigious prize, but it does offer music in a bit of an unconventional manner. It's fresh and that's what those people are looking for."}

{"text":"Dusted Reviews\n\nAlways a bit icy, each edition of Adult. has followed a different path below zero. Why Bother? drops the bass guitar that gave a black sheen to their synth 'n' caterwaul sound over the past few years. Now it's back to the blips, with every stab pushed into the squelching range. The pristine electro of their earlier work has accumulated road salt from the drive through death rock. They give us dirt this time, as scenic as that brown ice that builds up behind a car's wheel by the end of winter.\n\nAs their music has grown more detailed, the details have become ever more foreboding. The disco handclaps that lent goofy charm to an early track like \"Nite Life\" are still present in \"I'm Inclined to Vomit\" (predictably, one of the highlights here). But slipped between three other beats, the claps crack like the work of a chiropractor. The lyrics for \"Vomit\" are even less subtle than the title, yet the loops of crud and relentlessly off-center rhythms stagger into fully formed song. It's a common theme on Bother? - tunes bust out at punk tempos, glassy squalls fighting against the vocals with verse-chorus-verse familiarity rising out of all the twisting and shouting. The less ornate numbers come across more like instrumentals, even when Nicola Kuperus tries to sing. She actually carries a tune in a few spots here, a distinct departure from the constant harangue of D.U.M.E. and Gimme Trouble. It's a good strategy for making such willfully ugly music enticing. Each straight-ahead song has a hook, and while it's a hook weighted with hatefulness, it's something to grasp in the tornado of digital scuzz. The moodier and open-ended bits become a welcome chill out.\n\nWhy Bother? is the work of an \"album\" band, with their dance roots receding into the distance. There's a theme: the forces of conformity closing in, a disgust towards those that try to herd the sheep. There's the consistent fried-circuit sound. Two of the more fragmentary bits are the soundtrack for a video on their website. It's not a music video, it's more of an arthouse thing. Two figures wander separately, their heads cropped out of every shot. They keep describing the same geometric symbol- in chopped kindling, in embroidery, in blood. Adult. has become a self contained project - part music, part photography, all driving towards an aesthetic where the rusty and discarded and disjointed are presented with antiseptic precision.\n\nIf Adult. has forsaken the social functions of dance music, they still hold on to a few principles from their electro days; a willingness to go over the top without winking, rhythm kept as the centerpiece. The right beats can overcome the most haywire setting. \"Nite Life\" posed the question \"Which do I keep \/ you or my nightlife?\" The nightlife is gone, but so is any hint of daylight."}

{"text":"It's a clich\u00e9\u2014but a funny one\u2014that every singer who performed in a nineties rock band sounded roughly the same. Sure, there're more than a few songs Eddie Vedder, Kurt Cobain and Scott Weiland could trade off on and no one would know the difference. But one of those guys is dead, one plays the ukulele and the other is somehow just still alive. Weiland's Stone Temple Pilots might be the least versatile of those groups represented in the aforementioned triumvirate\u2014and no, Soundgarden hasn't been given short shrift, since they were always a cock-rock band. But STP's handful of hits still hold on to a bit of gut-level authenticity, obscenely absent from rock 'n' roll over the last decade. 1992's \"Core\" comprises more than a bit of filler, angling at moving beyond hard rock flailing into some sort of music that both tells a story and issues emotion. STP's \"Creep\" isn't even the best song with that name, but the slower pacing serves Weiland, as his voice takes on a softer, but still strained, approach to leading a song through the paces. Rhyming mouse with just about anything is a bummer, but the song's twenty-year-old charm pushes through a narco-haze. Following up its first success, the 1994 \"Purple\" finds the band using the same sort of template-jerky guitar, shaking off its most metallic inclinations as Weiland further pushes himself to, you know, actually sing. \"Vasoline\" was a hit\u2014and it may have been better if one of those other flannel-clad stalwarts sang it. STP kept working through the mid-decade decline of its mini-genre, making a final stand in 2001, before a nine-year hiatus. Returning with a self-titled work in 2010 that occasionally sounded like a broken Black Crowes\u2014\"Hickory Dichotomy\" taking twang to a place it wasn't meant to go\u2014didn't announce a renaissance. It just reminded folks with a radio that Weiland had somehow avoided an overdose and meant Velvet Revolver was taking a much-needed break. STP's trek through town might count as classic rock to an entire generation, and the show's affixed price tag insinuates that. (Dave Cantor)"}

{"text":"We built our own studio in between Boxer and making High Violet, so it was the first time we really had a creative workshop environment where we could try lots of different things out. In some ways, that meant really working on the arrangements a lot. There's a couple of them, \"England\" or \"Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks,\" that are probably the biggest orchestral arrangements on records that we've ever done. Then there's other elements where the opposite is true as well. From the minute we started working on the record, we recorded everything. There's a lot of sounds on there that are almost more improvised.\n\nBoxer has a really elegant, almost minimalist aesthetic to it, where it's very spare and kind of restrained - High Violet does have a lot more of these spontaneous moments or sounds that we kept, that we like so much. The beginning of the record -- some people complained about how fuzzy the guitar tone is on \"Terrible Love.\" To us, it was a sound we had envisioned but never had been able to achieve. In a way, it's like an accidental guitar tone that we were able to keep.\n\nDo you think [these complaints are] also a reflection [of how] after Boxer, people had a lot of expectations for you? It's definitely a very anticipated record.\nWhen Boxer came out, there was a huge Internet war that followed, where people were fighting about whether Alligator or Boxer, which one was better - specifically I think Alligator is more of a rock record, and Boxer is much more restrained. High Violet, how that fits with those two - I don't know. To me, they're a trilogy of records that are related that change, morph and develop the band's sound, it's not like it's a massive left turn. In our own way, we're trying to keep ourselves interested and push ourselves musically on each record - and define certain things that are different."}

The album is awesome and I've included several tracks (the title track and the reprise are beautiful) into my programming playlists to keep me wee fingers coding during the long stretches.\nA little background:\nClint scraped together the cash to record this, then turned around and self mixed and released the album. That is amazing! As someone who also creates through writing and music, I have to give anyone who completes something a giant high-five. That stuff is hard.

{"text":"Blog: HearYa: An Indie Music Blog\n\nIt has been over 20 years since The Mother Hips released their debut album Back to the Grotto , which begs the question: What were were you listening to in 1992? I was a sophomore in high school back then and can't recall if I had dial-up internet yet or not. If I did, I know that services like Rhapsody, Pandora, MOG, and Spotify weren't born.

{"text":"The 1975\n\nHome Town: Manchester\n\nContemporary British indie tends to come in for a bit of a battering. The critics lay plenty of charges at the landfill's door, but there's one jibe that rings true to even the most staunch defender's ear: young bands simply aren't writing big pop tunes. The 1975 certainly can't be accused of staring at their shoes, hiding behind abstraction, or burying their melodies under a wall of distortion. They write big melodious teenage pop songs with plenty of heart, and a focus on melody and sharp arrangements.\n\nThat's not to say they play entirely by convention. First off, The 1975 are from Manchester but Matt Healy sings like an American post-hardcore romantic (it's not just a Welsh phenomenon), occasionally dropping into a distinctly London drawl. The arrangements do shimmer, \"The City\" is remarkably slick but it's builds from a distinctly minimal fuzzed out bass line. The effect is remarkably similar to that of early-Razorlight, it sounds authentic enough to make indie hearts flutter but big enough to snag the pop crowd. However, The 1975 tend to counterpoint each pop song with a mood piece. \"Anitchrist\" and \"Facedown\" manage to simultaneously recall post-Joy Division acolytes The Editors and White Lies, and American arena heavyweights Thirty Seconds To Mars.\n\nListening to surefire hit \"Sex\", The 1975 oddly recall Ash, not sonically, but in the way that they take an distinctly American rock approach and distill it into a British indie product. The big single yelps and yearns, doing all the things that typical get young girls reaching for the sky screaming. Whether indie needs another mid-tempo, big emotion band remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: The 1975 are custom built for success \u2013 and how often do we get to say that about an indie band these days?\n\nThe Buzz: Big emotional indie that plays to the back row, with occasional bursts of textural moodiness."}
{"text":"Chromaticshave leaked yet another video from their new Kill For Love album, leaving many fans wondering when the damn thing's going to actually come out. Well, we've got some good news for you: it's in the final stages of mastering and should be ready later this month. As it turns out, self-titled recently spoke to Italians Do It Better's in-house producer, Johnny Jewel, for our next magazine issue, and he had a lot to say about not only Chromatics, but Glass Candy's next record (Body Work) and the long-awaited second installment of IDIB's popular After Dark compilation.\n\nCheck out a lengthy excerpt from our interview below\u2014we spoke for nearly two hours and ended up with a 10,000-word transcript\u2014along with the first four singles from Kill For Love. Interested in reading more? Subscribe to self-titledhere and get our new issue (featuring Grimes, Schoolboy Q, Optimo, Perfume Genius, Julia Holter and many, many more) delivered to your inbox the second our fully enhanced edition is ready in late March\u2026\n\nSome of the records you're putting out this year were first promised as early as 2009. Have you scrapped a lot of songs in the interim because you're a bit of a perfectionist?\nThe songs haven't been scrapped. If anything, there's too many of them, so they have to be put into groups alongside different production voices. And once I find the proper context of a song, it has to fit the overall idea of the album. Everything has to be a cog in the wheel, serving the ultimate purpose of the record. That's what takes so long. Like Body Work has 45 tracks that need to be narrowed down to 15. And Kill For Love was narrowed down from 36 tracks to 17.\n\nIt's not even about what's the best song, or finding the one single and wrapping the rest of the record around that. I often put things that're hot on hold, like \"Into the Black\" was recorded in 2009 and we just released it now. I've been sitting on it this whole time because we needed to find other songs that'd go with it. That song has a lot of meanings already, but in a literal sense for Chromatics, it's the first song we recorded after the buzz for Night Drive. In 2008, I was already seeing how the indie world and the electronic world was going to become more prevalent. So I wanted to bring it back to an album opener that says, 'Rock 'n' roll can never die.' Because everyone's using synths now. I was so tempted to put it out as a single two years ago because that song's so awesome. I think it's my favorite vocal take of Ruth's. Until yesterday, no one in the band had a copy of the song. I wouldn't let anyone have it because I was so paranoid someone would put it out.\n\nYou don't let Mike [Simonetti] from the label hear anything until it's out either, right?\nRight. I'm really paranoid that way. It's no disrespect to Mike; I'm just really protective of my stuff. I used to love sharing demos on MySpace, but as we reached a wider audience outside our core fans, I noticed that my conceptual leaps were being misconstrued as proper follow-up tracks. So I stopped sharing them until they were ready to come out. It drives booking agents and publications crazy because I don't give preferential treatment to the press. It's funny\u2014people think the Chromatics record is never going to come out because no one has advance copies of it, but it's done. I'm just not going to let anyone hear it. [Laughs] I'd rather everyone hear the songs in sequential order when it's ready. Like \"Into the Black\" is very guitar-oriented, and I love leaving people wondering whether the entire record is going to be folk-y like that.\n\nI love how subtle that cover song is. A lot of electronic producers would put a big beat behind it, but you left it pretty spare.\nThat was the essence of the song for me, because we're producers but we're also songwriters. Chromatics may be on the cutting edge tonally sometimes, but we're such a traditional group in the classic sense of Joy Division or the Velvet Underground. Glass Candy is much more experimental. There will be plenty of disco beats on the Chromatics album, but I wanted to cleanse the palette first.\n\nYou mentioned that the Chromatics and Glass Candy albums both work as a total package. Can you tell us anything about how that package might look and sound?\nGlass Candy is harder, and more aggressive, than Beat Box. That's the main difference.\n\nWhat do you mean by that? Like a more refined way of how aggressive and no-wave-y Glass Candy sounded in the beginning?\nThat had more to do with us not knowing how to record or play, yet wanting to do everything ourselves. We definitely struggled with what we were trying to accomplish. I would say the new album is aggressive compared to the last album. It's more like [the Beat Box song] \"Candy Castle\" on steroids. Ida's never going to rap, but the beats are more like hip-hop\u2014wilder, bouncing around from harder electro stuff. Well, what I'd consider hard. It's not like\u2026\n\nNot like what's popular in the clubs right now\u2014music that bashes you over the head a bit?\nRight. There's some elegant moments on the record, but most of it is pretty hard compared to how soft something like \"Computer Love\" is. The keyboards have some bite and buzz to them, too, and there's some sample-based stuff that's really grimy. You have to remember that it took me five years to complete [Chromatics' last album] Night Drive and Beat Box. It's just that no one was paying attention then. Now everyone's watching, thinking, 'He sure is taking a lot of time with this.' Real songs with actual shelf lives aren't rushed.\n\nAs for how the Chromatics record sounds compared to Night Drive, it's more pop\u2014leaner and more abbreviated, with the experimental moments being more extreme, stretched out and vacant.\n\nHow has Ida evolved as a singer? Is she more comfortable with writing her own melodies now?\nShe's still insecure. We're all self-taught, so none of us know what the hell we're doing. She's definitely exploring melody more, though, like in \"Warm In the Winter\" and \"Beautiful Object.\" There's also some spoken word on Body Work, like this awesome song called \"Bringer of the Dawn\" that's her having a conversation with an ATM machine. That was the first song I recorded when I moved to Montreal three years ago.\n\nAnd these aren't interludes either, right? They're entire songs built around spoken word?\nYeah, it's like five minutes of poetry.\n\nThat's pretty ballsy.\nTrust me, I know. It's going to be a love or hate thing, and I don't really care. I love it. And then there's an interlude track where she's talking over a beat like that DJ in The Warriors, like a traditional hip-hop narrator in Fear of a Black Planet or Midnight Marauders.\n\nHas the new Glass Candy album reached a point where you've stopped recording new tracks and are focusing on figuring out the sequencing and mixing?\nYeah, sequencing and designing, finding the right wrapping paper for the songs. We're not adding any more tracks, that's for sure. I'm hoping that'll be out by the end of May, right around my birthday. But if it's not ready, whatever. People can chill out. That's one thing about the computer world\u2014people feel so pressured to put their music out that it becomes watered down. You need to let your art marinate, you know? One of the reasons I have my own record label is that I don't like deadlines.\n\nThe most important thing is that there's no filler. It's all quality. I'm so proud of that. Not a lot of people can say that about their record label or their own releases.\n\nSo is the second After Dark compilation material that isn't already out on singles? The last one had a lot of demos on it, too.\nIt had that, and a lot of 12-inches. This one's the same way. After Dark should be out in early April, late March. For some reason, I thought the Chromatics album had to come out first. It just felt right, so I've been kinda sitting on it. All of the tracks are there; it just needs to be mixed. I'm also trying to decide if I want to make it a double disc because we have enough music to do that. I think it's going to be a single like the last one, though.\n\nAnd you produced everything that's on it?\nYeah, there's only one beat on it that I didn't write, but I'm mixing and doing post-production on it. One of the concepts is that every track shares the same kick drum. I'm not sure if that's possible in the end but we'll see. But yeah, I'm producing the Mirage stuff, there's new Farah, new Desire, new Glass Candy, new Chromatics, but also singles like \"Warm In the Winter\" and \"Kill For Love.\" It's a label sampler, not all this crazy shit you've never heard before.\n\nIf all goes well, are you trying to do any other records this year?\nYeah, we already have 23 songs for the Farah album that we started in November of 2008. Desire has a bunch of material, but I have to be in the right mood for Desire, and I haven't felt like doing it yet. After Dark has three new singles, though, which is a lot. I don't see myself doing a Desire record until the fall at the very earliest, though. There's been such a resurgence in the old stuff that I'm letting that breathe and we're doing some shows again.\n\nYou just put out a video, too.\nYeah, of a song that's almost three years old. Because of [the movie] Drive and the Cudi thing, it's like Desire's suddenly a new band. The album's in the Top 50 of iTunes' Electronic section, which is insane because nobody cared about it when it came out.\n\nIt was really overlooked, yeah.\nI was really shocked because I was really proud of it, but it came out at a time when everyone wanted a new Chromatics record. It's like some people felt like they were being forced to choose between Chromatics and Desire because we share members, but it wasn't that way at all. We just needed to regroup and figure out how we were going to tour because Ruth is such a fragile singer. It's not like rocking a party with Glass Candy. Europe understood Desire, but it's almost like it wasn't oblique enough for critics here. It's playful, it's melodic, it's cute, it's love songs. And I think it's difficult for American audiences to see the weight in that sometimes. But yeah, it's weird that it's getting this mainstream audience now. The \"Under Your Spell\" thing we didn't even make on YouTube had three million views. Think about that; all of the videos we've ever made don't even add up to a third of that. It's absurd."}
{"text":"Howl Howl Gaff Gaff\n\nBud Fox; 2003\n\nArtists:\n\nFind it at:\n\nThanks to \"Very Loud\", the weepy hit single whose moaning guitar captured them byline status in Rolling Stone, Stockholm's Shout Out Louds leapt from humble European club roots to minor international exposure late last year. Though it's harsh and reductive to label them \"the emo Strokes\", it's also true: These romantics may bring a much-needed, heart-on-sleeve honesty to the too-serious underground, but they're riding a pale horse.\n\nTwee ebullience generally indicates a Pacific Northwestern pedigree; Love as Laughter, for example, ran pretty much the same sound up the flagpole in 2001, which we at Pitchfork saluted, rallying around its perfect opener \"Coast to Coast\". The inspired proposition of Cars keyboards and Built to Spill guitars on Howl Howl Gaff Gaff's \"The Comeback\" made me eager, and defenseless against the heart-swelling chorus of \"Very Loud\". Wiping the mist from my eyes after the umpteenth full-volume blast of its chorus (\"Little by little\/ You're gonna hear me cry\"), I nervously let the album play through, not wanting to leave the springtime embrace it welcomed me with.\n\nNo music, no event I can imagine, even now-- a Dear John email, Japanese noisecore-- could have stifled the boundless opening daydreams of Howl Howl Gaff Gaff as dramatically as \"Shut Your Eyes\", a loathsome, sped-up perjury of The Strokes' \"The Modern Age\" that drives home the downside of the band's shameless romanticism. It's only rock 'n' roll to them.\n\n\"Screw continuity,\" I thought, and frantically scanned the record for that first feeling. Where did it go? How can you have it and lose it in 30 seconds? Sadly, the band seem to be asking the same question, as their only other moment of transcendence, the closing \"My Friend and the Ink on His Fingers\" is a decelerated reworking of \"Very Loud\". Dejected and emotionless, I resigned myself to plowing through the rest of Howl Howl Gaff Gaff, knowing I'd been somewhere I could never revisit.\n\nThankfully, it doesn't get worse than \"Shut Your Eyes\"; the opening Travis chords of their new single \"Please Please Please\" don't lead into any Britpop bleating. A subdued romp, the track's hard-panned, clean Stratocasters nonetheless reek of their shambling NYC predecessors, and I'm hard-pressed to think of anyone else they could have been inspired by. Their bio broadcasts Grandaddy and Elf Power, which, given the occasional use of vibes, makes some sense, but they go on to invoke The Stone Roses and The Cure, betraying that whatever The Shout Out Louds have in mind is a bit beyond their reach right now.\n\n\"100\u00b0\", their first single, dates from 2002, and cops the only Cure move you'll hear on the album-- a lead keyboard-- but you're as likely to think you're listening to old Modest Mouse (and by that I mean Sad Sappy Sucker) during its chorus. The stumbling, fragmentary plods \"There's Nothing\" and \"Wish I Was Dead\", both dressed up in xylophone and Elf Power guitar tones, are in huge contrast to the rest of the album, solid evidence that after just over a year together, the band are still figuring things out.\n\nEnergetic, perhaps to a fault, The Shout Out Louds seem destined to fade into memory once their romance with pop music ends, and there's no fire extinguisher for that spark like a jaded American or British audience sighing through the next big thing. Recent dates in NYC weren't disasters, but like any band, The Shout Out Louds' existence is dependent on their ability to suspend disbelief, and I don't know how long they can keep that up. As a better man with two first names once said, you gotta have faith."}

They're going to argue and they're going to support creative vandalism and thoughtful shit-talking. They're going to jump to conclusions when they see a suit and a tie, when they see a guy with a badge, when they see a guy with a smug look on his face and an expensive smell to him, step out of a shiny car, wearing expensive shoes. They're going to find legitimate reasons to get themselves agitated, just not enough to break a sweat. They're likely to take their gripes and throw them into clever, ramshackle avant garde punk songs and let them speak for themselves, to whomever will listen.\n\nThe young UK band enjoys the pastime of prodding and cajoling the upper crust. They're not necessarily tired of their lot in life - they're just tired of the selfish pricks having all the fun and having all of the nice shit. They don't like the demeanor and they see the possession of cool and expensive shit, of having the means to obtain it, as an affront. It's as if, when they see someone driving a Mercedes, that person might as well just open the driver's side door, step out from the vehicle, unzip their fine trousers and piss all over them. It's the same thing, in so many ways and it's what the Pheromoans specialize in.\n\nTheirs are somewhat bizarre and erratic musings on power and money in a similar way to how Art Brut mused on fame and the business of making and putting out records. They are mostly tongue-in-cheek quips about social and financial inequality, but really they're just the gentle jealousies that we all have when we're seeing assholes reap such stupendous benefits and we're left struggling to make the ends meet. They sing about someone who must be a celebrity, or someone who wants to be famous, saying that they should have silver shoes and a car - preferably that Mercedes referenced above, \"Cause I am entitled, it was decreed by an editor.\" When you put it that way, of course it's going to feel shady and gross. Then, to add insult to injury, they continue counting the many ways that this is all a travesty, singing, \"And it's just a coincidence that your favorite football team is the most successful and your favorite sprinter is the fastest.\" It's sure hard not to hate a real prick like that. The Pheromoans are absolutely right."}

{"text":"my nephew was a baby and he became sick, his mom would ask him if he had to go \"pukos\", her way of saying \"puke\" in baby talk. When I was in intermediate school in Honolulu, I would say \"mukos\" or \"hanamoko\" to describe galagala, or what is known as phlegm, as in something that has to do with mucus. When your stomach is upset, it's not because Comcast isn't working. You might get a bit of the rumbly tumblies, and Paws feel your pain. They even had someone draw a cover that represents pukos, galagala, and hanamoko in one sitting. The song Paws perform is called \"Sore Dummy\", and it sounds like the kind of psych\/psychedelic pop\/rock that bands from the 1960\u2032s would have done after hours, but the truth is, this is not musical ipecac.

{"text":"After initial industrial clanks that sound like they escaped from Portishead's Third, opener Bad Insect lays on the euphoric Underworld synths and sticks with them while Bettinson croons elliptical, occasionally abstract lyrics. The repeated refrain of \"Not gonna sing unless somebody's holding on\" is particularly enticing.\n\nGold Dayzz and Static Light are more challenging, but are both intriguing listens. They are full of overlapping snippets of vocals bleeding into one another, beats that misdirect and melodies that change direction. Talking Heads at their most esoteric are a key reference point worth noting, as are underrated New York duo Phantogram.\n\nLater, Easier is even better. Its wondrous descending chord riff and sublime vocal is resminiscent of Braids at their most seductive, or Chairlift gone funky.\n\nPre-album teaser release Smalltalk follows it and is the album's best moment. Bettinson's voice is assured but vulnerable, like Little Dragon's Yukimi Nagano at her devastating best, while Waronker's deceptively simple beat can do no wrong.\n\nFrom its start to the jazzy electro shuffle of You're Out that rounds it off, Ultra\u00edsta is consistently involving, even if it sags in the middle with Our Song. It's set to be a cult favourite rather than sell millions of copies, but this is because it contains fascinating ideas you won't hear on most pop records.\n\nSeveral visually striking band-made videos of their songs have surfaced online, too, so it's worth checking out what they've made for your eyes as well as your ears"}

{"text":"eMusic Contributor\n\nSigur R\u00f3s, Inni\n\nFeatured Album\n\nIs this live double album a placeholder or a memorial plaque? With the Icelanders on \"indefinite hiatus\" according to frontman J\u00f3nsi it's hard to tell, but either way it's a handsome piece of work: an almost two-hour document, with an accompanying movie, of their shows at London's Alexandra Palace in November 2008. The Palace is a cavernous venue whose treacherous acoustics have swallowed other bands, but Sigur Ros are nothing if not adept at filling a space. Scale is their forte.\n\nInni opens fittingly with the sonar ping of Svefn-G-Englar, which was most listeners' first taste of the band's engulfing vastness over a decade ago and still feels as much like a weather formation as any piece of music can. A sparse four-man line-up, minus the horns and strings of previous tours, leaves the usually volcanic chorus of \"Hopp\u00edpolla\" a little muted but more than compensates elsewhere. Sequencing is the key. A string of giddy sunburst pop numbers from their last two studio albums gives way to heavyweight slow-burners like \"Hafs\u00f3l\" and \"Popplagi\ufffd\u00b0,\" each one ascending with a shudder towards effects-pedal Valhalla, and finally coasts to a close with the rippling calm of solitary new song \"Luppulagio.\"\n\nAs live albums go it's pretty persuasive, though with one caveat: the same kind of applause which gives most concert albums their atmosphere almost shatters the spell here. Compared to all the extraordinary images that Sigur Ros's music evokes, the thought of a few thousand people in a giant hall in north London feels strangely deflating"}

{"text":"Review\n\nThe Rhumb Line is only Syracuse quintet Ra Ra Riot's first full-length release, but the band has already endured a Behind the Music's worth of shakeups and tragedy. Less than a year after original frontman Shaw Flick exited the co-ed group, drummer John Pike went missing at a house party and his body was later discovered in a nearby bay in Fairhaven, MA. Rhumb serves as somewhat of a tribute to Pike, as no less than half of the album's songs were penned by the late 23-year-old, including the standout \"Dying Is Fine,\" the hook of which is taken from ee cummings's poem \"dying is fine)but Death.\" Opening track \"Ghost Under Rocks,\" also co-written by Pike, is both rollicking and elegiac, while \"Winter '05,\" written by new lead vocalist Wes Miles (though likely not about Pike), only adds to the album's profound\u2014but not overwhelming or dour\u2014sense of loss: \"If you were here\/Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow\/And if you were here\/Then I'd have a choice\/To live, not be alone.\"\n\nCounting a violinist and cellist among their ranks, Ra Ra Riot has fashioned a gritty yet polished post-punk sound fit for a Sofia Coppola film. Several songs originally featured on the band's self-titled 2007 EP have been given a slightly glossier, more reverb-y quality here courtesy of indie-rock producer Ryan Hadlock, including \"Can You Tell,\" which was co-written by Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij and features flirty quips like \"My bed's too big for just me,\" while \"St. Peter's Day Festival,\" \"Suspended in Gaffa\" and the \u00fcber-catchy \"Oh, La\" showcase Ra Ra Riot's sublime instrumental symbiosis and countermelodies. Unless you're a math geek, you'll be unlikely to find much meaning behind the album's title, but a certain amount of quirk can be expected from a band that likes to cover Kate Bush songs."}

Cultivating what appears to be a Flock of Seagulls influence, The Burning Hotels may be re-visiting the '80s a la so many others before them, but they're certainly doing so on their own terms and in their own way.

I guess critical praise can change minds though, so the band decided to tour, things went well, and here we are.\n\nFor those less familiar, Japandroids are comprised of Brian King (guitar and vocals) and David Prowse (drums and vocals), and for two guys they make a big sound. It is said they are two guys trying sound like five, and if anyone can, they do.\n\nThere are a lot of similarities between Post-Nothing and Celebration Rock. Just one look at the covers lets you know that they aren't too different. And the fact that they are both 8 song albums, clocking in at 35 minutes a piece doesn't help. You still get that same big fuzzy sound and two dudes screaming at you. There are differences though, and those differences make Celebration Rock better than its predecessor.\n\nKnowing what we do about Post-Nothing, it's easy to hear the sound of two guys getting older, trying to be rock stars, and dealing with having to give it all up some day. It's what appeared to be happening in their lives, and while it still rocks, it's a bit of a bummer at times because it's where many of us have eventually gone (or sadly will be some day). Celebration Rock is the album of those same guys that ended up getting to become what they had hoped to become and lets the world know not to give up and that \"if they can do it, you can too.\" In doing so, it takes that similar sound, and puts a positive and uplifting spin on it all. Hell even starts and ends with fireworks!\n\nSimply put, if you want an album to rock out to this summer, Celebration Rock is it. It's made for running in the sun, driving fast, and screaming with your drunken friends late into the night. Maybe it's not all that different than the previous Japandroids album, but if it isn't broke, don't fix it\u2026 unless you make little fixes that make it better. This is what Japandroids have done this go round. In doing so they remind us, and themselves, that rock isn't about getting older, it's about being young forever.\n\nKey Tracks: The Nights of Wine and Roses, For the Love of Ivy, The House That Heaven Built"}

{"text":"Interview\n\nI think I've always had this dream about recording my own album. I guess the time was right now. The Flower Kings have had the release of \"Retropolis\" in which I composed a few songs. Then I was inspired and off we go!\n\nAll songs on the album were composed by yourself. Did you had finished ideas when you went into the studio or were some parts even composed while recording?\n\nThe following songs where mainly completed before we started to record them in the studio: \"Into the dreamscape\", \"The ballerina from far beyond\", \"Speed wizard\", \"In the land of the pumpkins\", \"Three stories\". The rest of the material was partly instant composing. I think musicians always take influences from each other. That's why I prefer to play with Roine or Jaime. I mean they stand for good influences.\n\nBesides them, which other musicians did influence you the most?\n\nI just love symphonic rock, one of my biggest kicks was \"Relayer\". But I also like Fusionrock i.e. Weather Report. So that's the explanation to some of the material. But to answer your question. The answer is without any doubt Roine.\n\nOn your album you play many different kinds of keyboards i.e. Mellotron, Church Organ or Hammond. Are they all original or did you also use some samples?\n\nI'm playing both the original stuff and samples. To me it doesn't really matter which kind of instrument you are using. The important thing is how it sounds and how you're playing it. Another funny thing is that it's easier to play a real piano compared to a samplepiano.\n\nIs it you hiding behind the pseudonym Gepetto Azzaro?\n\nYes, I am Gepetto. I found that name could match with Roines pseudnoym, Mr. Don Azzaro."}
{"text":"Concert review: Beast Make Bomb\n\nStephen Bradley\n\nVIENNA, Va., March, 27, 2012\u2014There's something decidedly off and irreverent about Beast Make Bomb. It could be the odd of use grammar in their or that their mix of female and male members happen to askew the normally assigned roles in a band. The band just happens to strike a different chord purely by being something of an uncomplicated unit.\n\nIn fact there are several slightly off kilter bits that makes Beast Make Bomb an engaging and unique band. None of these things seem like they should be a big deal but in the larger context of the underground rock circuit, they're things that make anyone paying attention take notice and possibly exclaim \"oh cool!\" at the thought of the band.\n\nFunnily Beast Make Bomb isn't necessarily a unique band at any given point. They take several like minded influences like '80s post-punk and jangle-pop, and meld into an endearing indie pop\/rock package. It seems simple enough for a band to put together the kind of tunes Beast Make Bomb, and on the surface there's nothing about them that immediately sticks out.\n\nWhat does make an impression though is how tightly held together their songs are. Each of their songs is a burst of concisely orchestrated pop. None of the songs overstay their welcome and the ideas rarely underdeveloped. They never attempt to overstep their reach, instead relying simple yet catchy melodies, which seem to be inherent within the band.\n\nIn fact there are a lot of things that are just catchy about them. Whether it's their basic make-up of two guys and two girls, with the girls taking over the roles usually associated with being male dominated. Glenn Van Dyke's guitar work fluctuates between post-punk distorted brashness and twee-pop airiness always keeping it in line with the song. Ceci Gomez's vocals are strong and hit the envious musty tone of girl-with-cold that goes along perfectly with her easy going and subdued lyrical content.\n\nIt would be easy to lump them in with a number of indie\/garage rock bands but it would be doing them a bit of a disservice. There's too much craft applied to their songs give them the proper chaotic feel. That's not to say they play up tight, but they fine tuned their songs to great extent. Beast Make Bomb has a certain kind of loose and playful energy about their set, but a lot of that extends from elsewhere.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Beast Make Bomb is just a fun band. It's hard to imagine any band up on stage that look to be enjoying themselves as much as this band does. This extends to play their songs with bouncing energy and results in them covering a fun, upbeat song like Harvey Danger's \"Flagpole Sita.\" That energy just becomes more infectious as they play and gives each of their songs more punch as their set progresses.\n\nThe most impressive about Beast Make Bomb's set and their general outlook as a band is their relative youth. Midway through their set Gomez related a story about the last time they played in DC and almost getting kicked out of their gig because bass player Sam Goldfine at the time being under 21 and trying to use a fake ID. So, it's no surprise they play with energy, but the precision they couple with that energy.\n\nRight now, places like DC9 are perfect places for them to headline but it's likely to assume they'll be playing bigger venues before too long. Beast Make Bombs is the kind of pop\/rock band everyone should be keeping their eye in the"}
{"text":"For Diwas Gurung, music is ever evolving. The former guitarist of Albatross, then a heavy metal band, the founding member of Ayurveda, a former progressive rock band based in Ithaca, New York, and now a member of Photoreal, an electronic band, Gurung has always experimented with different music.\n\nHis solo works, Rato Mato, a folk-fusion album and Adhunique, an EP, explore Nepali folk compositions. His covers of timeless Nepali folk songs in Rato Mato were highly appreciated by the audiences in Nepal and the United States alike.\n\nThe Week's Asmita Manandhar met Gurung, currently based in Ithaca, New York, over Skype to know more about his present ventures.\n\nWhat are you involved in these days?\n\nIt's been 8-9 months since Ayurveda broke up. Now I'm in a band called Photoreal. The band has three of Ayurveda's members \u2013 Dan Halperin, Mike Parker, and me.\n\nHow was your experience of forming Ayurveda and making music influenced by Nepali folksongs?\n\nIt was a rock metal band when we started. Eventually, we made music that sounded more like progressive rock and it was after I recorded Rato Mato, Ayurveda too became heavily influenced by Nepali folk music.\n\nWhen we did live music for the Nepali Folk Night, a biweekly show at a local club, the band members weren't tied to any limitations. Even when we were playing Nepali music, we used to play music which suited our individual interpretations and that also brought lot of new taste to the music.\n\nIn later days, Ayurveda had gained a dual identity. People who had followed Ayurveda in its initial days took it as a metal band. And later, Nepali folk influenced music gathered a different kind of crowd. The band itself was very confused and we were in dilemmas, mainly while touring. Some would expect us to play pure metal; some would anticipate fusion and traditional Nepali music.\n\nNow that we've formed a new band, I'll be doing my Nepali compositions side by side. I have no intention to mix it with Photoreal's style of music.\n\nHow is Photoreal different from Ayurveda?\n\nWith Photoreal, we're trying to make music that naturally comes to us. The music is going to be western, more of electronic. Though the band constitutes members from Ayurveda, the music won't be influenced by Nepali compositions. For now, I want to venture into Nepali music separately.\n\nYou started off with metal, then progressive rock, and later were influenced by Nepali folk music. How did these changes happen?\n\nMetal is certainly very restricted, and it's more appealing to a certain age group. We were purely a metal band and performed hundred of shows. But it became too confining for us.Music yields more meaning when we're able to add something to what there already is. But with metal, we couldn't do that. There was nothing for us that weren't already done.\n\nAlso, our tastes got refined and broadened. There should be something surprising in music for a musician to move on. Then we experimented with different music styles along with Nepali folk songs. Now, dark electronic music is exciting me and that's what's influencing Photoreal's music.\n\nHow was your experience of playing music influenced by Nepali folk songs in a foreign land?\n\nNepalis in United States have a great appetite for Nepali folksongs. So when we were playing for the Nepali crowds, it was always great. For non-Nepalis, they wouldn't understand anything. But despite that, some had really liked the melodies.\n\nNepali music had different impacts on different people and it also depended on the contexts. Our live shows have been pretty powerful and I've seen non-Nepalis equally enjoying our shows. I also have had experiences of people researching Nepal after they heard our music, which was great.\n\nHow do you see Nepali music progressing in Nepal?\n\nIt's been a while that I've been to Nepal. So I have yet to perceive the music scene there. I haven't yet fully realized how Rato Mato or Adhunique have been taken by people out there. But with the help of social networking sites and Youtube, I've been able to follow Nepali bands and I think they are bringing out some good music. I liked Night band's song and there is Jindabaad.\n\nI mostly follow ktmROCKS and the underground music scene. I can see there's been a lot of progress. Music videos have also become very polished. We had to struggle a lot before when we made music and it's good to see good music coming from the youth.\n\nAlso, the way bands are incorporating Nepali flavors to the western music is appreciable. I feel that the fusion actually creates more amazing music. And to have realized it is a mature choice. I guess it took me way longer than them to have realized that.\n\nHow important are native compositions for any musician?\n\nThe beauty of Nepali folksongs is that nobody knows who wrote them. They have been mostly handed down from generation to generation, which allows its flexibility to change according to every generation. We have a chance to experiment those songs with western instruments. Every attempt at a new adaptation is an effort to preserve native compositions. However, the efforts have to be genuine. There should be a realization and love for that kind of music.\n\nWhat would you like to say to aspiring musicians?\n\nHard work is definitely there. But besides that, you also have to enjoy the process. Also, finding the right people to work with is most important.\nMoreover, music as a career is not yet convincing. You have to make up your mind because it's definitely not a financially stable career and you have to be okay with it. Also, you'll have to persuade your parents with what you want to pursue.\n\nWhat are your future projects?\n\nWe'll be releasing two songs of Photoreal from a German record company next month. We will also be focusing on our live shows, enhancing it with synchronized light and sound effects. Most of my attention in the near future will be for Photoreal.\n\nAnd I'll be working on my Nepali album, too. It'll be a mixture of some original compositions, covers and some of my father's (OB Soaltee) songs. For this album, I'm also planning to include more Nepali music and incorporate Nepali percussions. I hope to visit Nepal in the winter and I look forward to build a skeleton of the album while there."}

Beat that, The Enemy.\n\nTheir debut album Through The Windowpane was deservedly nominated for a Mercury Music Prize, but the suspicion remained that that particular album didn't quite replicate the band's manic energy onstage.

{"text":"Alma Mater is the best Factory record you never heard. Period. It existed on the fringe of Tony Wilson's label by never cracking the British top 40, never producing a favoured single, and being completely outshined by other more definitive acts. The Monsters were eventually relegated to Factory's (almost more interesting) continental imprint, Factory Benelux. So by the time of its release the band was receiving no favours from the ever-growing shadow of Ian Curtis (Buried) while \"Blue Monday\" was keeping Factory in the black. Wilson could stand to sign these lolling, recalcitrant brats.\n\nNot that The Factory ever had any qualms in issuing records for their own sake, but The Stockholm Monsters were singular band full of naive musical skills and talentless vocals, which is probably why they were largely ignored. They straddle this border, strangely enough, between the echoing discomfort and sharp guitar jabs of A Certain Ratio and something resembling a more traditional, jigging Celtic shanty (which is a mess to consider in its own right). In this sense, one can also categorize their songs as dual in nature, either angular post-punk experiments or rather conventional, if not marginal, 80s English pop.\n\nBut something different is at work with \"Soft Babies\" and the song remains remarkable in The Monsters' oeuvre. It is a trickster of a track, vacillating between the two distinct song forms they are known for. It commences with Graveyard and Ballroom bass and sensible, catchy pop keys before, at the halfway mark, it collapses into its own experimental instrumentation. Dischorded ballerina box piano and trumpet expand to create a dismissive and cheeky landscape replete with sparse drums and Eroll Flynn name dropping before picking itself up and marching on. We never really understand either."}

Flash forward to a sold out XOYO show and a few daytime radio plays from Fearne Cotton and they're the hottest ticket in town. The initial reference points are still there, but now they're a much bigger beast.\n\nWith a debut album full of bambast and intamacy, being claimed as golden by almost everybody that writes about them, they had reason to be extatic as they took to the stage and opened with one of the best album openers of the year, 'T=0'.\n\nThere is a strange conundrum to Tall Ships though; for all the cool beardy blokes that love 'em, they're largely appealing by using the same, sometime sickly but always affecting power moments which have largely made Coldplay such a success (though in tracks like 'Gallop' Tall Ships posses a lot more oomph). Just to be clear, that reference isn't the start to a backlash, it's a sign of things to come. Tall Ships didn't leave the room without leaving everyone a solid fan - give it three more years and we'll probably wonder how we ever caught them so intimately"}

There's a number of influences at work here\u2014Brian Wilson vocals, a \"Be My Baby\" drumbeat, wall of sound reverb, a few bubblegum pop \"ooos\" and \"ahhs.\" The band isn't exactly breaking any new ground, but they take what could be a stale formula and make it sound fresh, if nothing else than from energy and sincerity. When frontman Sam Sundos sings, \"Just wanna go home\/wanna kiss the coast,\" he says it like he means it. The sentiment's loneliness is made even sadder by the bright, surf rock music playing paradoxically beneath the words.

Landing somewhere between acid house and Aztec Camera, their whirlpool of syrupy melodies, muscular rhythms and miasmic guitars is tied together by a desire to bend their instruments' capacity, to surprise people.\n\"We want to make people feel awesome when they hear us and say, 'What the fuck just happened to me?'\"\nThey're leaving an increasing number of people asking themselves that very question.

The girls ride skateboards down empty streets, their prom dresses flapping in the cool wind.\n\nFear of Tigers is the one-man project of London's Benjamin Berry. His debut album Cossus Snufsigalonica was one of 2009's best, and severely under-appreciated. He's back with the Madeon-esque and massive 'Golden Age'.\n\nA supercharged boomerang picks up speed and breaks through the barrier of time. Spinning back to the 80's, it shoots through clubs, making people airborne. Everyone is frozen in time as the boomerang whips around the city centre and freezes.

{"text":"How The Pros Hit The High Note\n\nOn the eve of releasing What Happened to the LaLas, the tenth studio album from jam band champions moe. percussionist Jim Loughlin sat down with HIGH TIMES to discuss what it's like playing stoned during a gig, and gives a shout out to his favorite Dutch coffee shop.\n\nInterview by Jen Bernstein Photos by Mike Hughes\n\nYour roots are in improvisational music \u2013 and moe. is well known as a jam band. Do you like to go off on tangents?\nIt's weird because it's not a freeform situation and people think it is. There is a form in which we improvise. I don't look at it the same way as jazz. It's rock 'n' roll. There are sections that are free, but surrounded by form.\n\nWe write and play songs for a year [before recording them] and they tend to get long. Really long. Parts are repeated. It works for a live performance, but listening to it on a record can be like, 'Oh my god. I know what the next part is, so why don't they just get there already?' [laughs].\n\nSo that's what we did. We figured out how to keep the songs tight, but really make them flow.\n\nLA LAs is a little different than past albums because for the first time you're working with Sugar Hill records.\nIt's the first time in a long time that we're working with a record company and producer. For me, it was great. In the studio you tend to over think things and when you have someone there with a goal, a direction, and an idea - it makes things a lot easier. When you're so close to the music, you don't have perspective. You take everything apart in these tiny pieces and just yell at one another.\n\nSo even though some songs on LA LAs are short, or they are songs that we already know because they've been road tested, there's a new type of freshness to it, given that they're tight?\nSome parts have been tweaked, and it sounds great. Sonically the record came out really good - it's raw, but it's not this overproduced, affected thing. We just did a good job getting the best parts.\n\n\"Chromatic Nightmare\" is your first writing credit. It has a very psychedelic feel, like a lilting circus type of sound.\nI originally wrote the song as a rag. Xylophones were big in ragtime back in the day, and a lot of Scott Joplin's stuff was played on xylophones. The idea was everyone was going to write a song for the Halloween show, which the theme was \"Electric Lemoe.nade Acid Test.\" So I was like, this has nothing to do with a rag and I made the song weirder and weirder until it morphed. Instead of it being in 4\/4 it was in 3\/4 and I kept adding lots of half steps to make it chromatic. So it had this weird \"oom-pah\" feel, and it got more Tim Burton-ish.\n\nYou nail the studio version despite what ended up being a challenging piece. Does smoking ever affect your performance?\nIt definitely comes up. We find a lot of professionals that don't have a hard time doing their job and smoking weed. As far as playing music, I don't think it makes much difference. I know I couldn't play \"Chromatic\" drunk. But, uh, I've been smoking for awhile and I'm used to it. It does slow things down on stage to the point where I can control it.\n\nmoe. played the Cannabis Cup back in 2007. What was it like playing those shows and hanging in the coffeeshops?\nIt was fun, and the funny thing is...and this isn't a plug or anything, but I spent all of my time at Barney's. No joke, I ate every meal there. It's where I had my morning coffee, and I wouldn't leave until I had to take a nap. Then, I'd go back and eat dinner. I had already been to Amsterdam, saw the tulips, the museums and everything. So this time I had no schedule. They had a crazy G-13 strain that was really nuts.\n\nCan you remember any other strains you liked?\nHonestly, the best way I can explain it is like this: I only know of two kinds of pot \u2013 pot and no pot. I'm happy when I have the first, and not as happy when I have the latter.\n\nY'know, a lot of people know that I smoke and some people give me stuff and there's always this explanation: the name, where it came from. I don't mean to rude, but I'm not a connoisseur. To me, I like how it tastes and I recognize the difference, but I never keep track of what I have. These days, it's all good! [laughs] and I haven't smoked brick weed in decades, so I'm happy.\n\nYou play piccolo bass, wash board, guitar and you sing \"Farmer Ben,\" are we going to get any more songs sung by Jim?\nI've always wanted to write a sequel. Just cause he's a real person, the story's not real, but the guy is. He's my best friend and I grew up with him. Ben spent the summers as a farmer on a restoration village circa the 1600's on LI - it's called Old Bethpage and he was a volunteer. He would wear a wool shirt, wool hat, wool overalls, in the hot sun - and a pitchfork - which I thought was hilarious. And this was high school I mean, what kid spends his summer sweating and working?! He's always done strange things - unique things. And now he's mapping old growth trees in Colorado. Doing good things.\n\nA Nightmare of a Song?\n\"When first playing 'Chromatic Nightmare' we sped up the song as it got to the end. It just got ridiculous, and Rob and Vin thought it was really funny that we kept going and going to the point where it was too challenging to even play.\""}

{"text":"Album Review: The Maccabees \u2013 Given To The Wild\n\nIt may seem that it isn't the ideal time for an indie band to bring out a new album, but The Maccabees have managed to generate quite a bit of hype in recent weeks nonetheless. And, at Given To The Wild's very best, that hype is well-deserved.\n\nThe first thing evident about The Maccabees' new effort is that every song is a relative slow-burner. It's effective as a real chillout album, and it's admirable that they've clearly thought of this record as a work of art rather that a collection of songs to play live, but it can get a little frustrating waiting until the penultimate verse of a song for that killer hook, and the result is songs that seemingly end all too quickly. One good example is the awkwardly-paced Heave, which plays like Coldplay's Fix You with a fast drum beat that rather clumsily accompanies classic chillout melodies.\n\nThere are a fair few exceptions to this trend, most notably the upbeat likes of 'proper' indie-rock anthem Pelican, but while it initially seems that this arena-ready lead single would cue the album to 'get going', normal service is pretty much resumed with '80s techno themed Went Away. Of course, there's nothing wrong with a chillout album, but the fact that Pelican stands out so much almost makes it feel out of place, and as a lead single it doesn't really represent the album that well.\n\nThat being said, The Maccabees have managed to create a sound that can only really be described as, well, The Maccabees, and that's thanks to the distinctive and altogether excellent vocal performance from Orlando Weeks. Combine this with the creativity of the entire band, and you have the potential for something quite spectacular.\n\nOf course, potential doesn't always mean a strong final product, but it's tracks like Feel To Follow that really puts The Maccabees firmly in the realm of the great indie rock bands, rather than the merely good ones. Another stand-out moment is the sombre yet inspired Forever I'm Known. Its progression that leads to a reasonably heavy chorus is surprising, but extremely well-done, and once again shows off the vocal talent Weeks has in abundance.\n\nAnother nice touch is the use of an intro track in Given To The Wild, which again presents the theme of The Maccabees really thinking of this album as a complete studio recording rather than a selection of songs to blast out onstage. It sets the chillout tone of the rest of the album nicely and leads into the masterful opener Child almost seamlessly.\n\nThe album does have its downsides, but unlike most albums weaker tracks cannot really be described as filler here, even if they don't have the same impact as the real highlights. The record does fade away a little with closing tracks Slowly One and Grew Up At Midnight, but to call these songs bad would be relatively harsh. That being said, the fact that the record drops in standard towards the end does mean it's tricky to view it as particularly consistent.\n\nAll in all, Given To The Wild is a creative record that manages to avoid being boring or derivative, but has occasional lapses that prevent it from being genuinely inspired. There are moments that make you believe Orlando Weeks and co could have pulled off the spectacular, and others that feel a little out of place, but despite imperfections it marks a solid return for The Maccabees."}
{"text":"'Halcyon' LP could surpass 'Lights'\n\nIn 2010, Ellie Goulding emerged onto the electropop scene with her hit song and album of the same name, \"Lights.\" With trance-like electric loops and wispy, almost child-like vocals, Goulding's \"Lights\" ascended Billboard's Hot 100 chart, making it as high as No. 2 in 2011. Riding the tails of this upward momentum, Goulding's second album, \"Halcyon,\" landed in U.S. stores Oct. 9. With vibes of familiarity and waves of freshness, \"Halcyon\" seems poised to skyrocket Goulding even higher into the pop stratosphere.\n\nThe album opens with \"Don't Say a Word,\" a song emphasizing Goulding's voice and vocal range over a penetrating, percussion-heavy backdrop. The song initiates a more purposeful tone than her previous album.\n\nThe album continues with \"My Blood\" and \"Anything Could Happen,\" which explore the differing themes of regret and optimism. The tone of each song serves to accentuate and enhance the themes at the heart of each track.\n\nTracks four and six, \"Only You\" and \"Figure 8,\" ramble around with a combination of rhythmic pop beat and vocal repetition reminiscent of \"Lights.\" These tracks bound back and forth with a familiar feel and bring the album closer to fans of Goulding's older songs.\n\nThe album then throws a slight curveball with tracks seven, nine and ten, \"JOY,\" \"Explosions\" and \"I Know You Care.\" To a backdrop of classical piano, \"JOY\" places Goulding's vocal abilities as the rhythmic, driving force for discovering the nature of dependent happiness. \"JOY\" resonates with a classical and near operatic feel that is again felt in \"Explosions.\"\n\n\"I Know You Care\" is by far the most stripped down track of the album, consisting of soulful and sympathetic vocals and a lone piano.\n\nThe album winds down through tracks 11, 12 and 13, \"Atlantis,\" \"Dead in the Water\" and \"I Need Your Love,\" which are all stylistically unique, but all deal with loss.\n\n\"Halcyon,\" comes to an appropriate close with the music sensation that is \"Lights,\" from her previous album. With heavy nods to her roots and some entirely fresh tracks, this album seems poised as the next step in the evolution of Ellie Goulding."}

{"text":"\/\n\n\/\n\nVideo: Battles f. Matias Aguayo, \"Ice Cream\"\n\nOne of the coolest things about listening to Battles' Gloss Drop is how it makes you feel crazily smart without being boring. It may be full of technical fireworks. Lots of stop-start instrumental moments and wild time signatures and sounds that we imagine can only be made by moving your fingers around a guitar really quickly and with supreme confidence. But it's also easy. There's not a moment where we're like, Gah what the hell, this sounds like what being on a jerky subway train feels like\u2014it's just clean weirdness. Here's a video for \"Ice Cream,\" which is one of the many tracks featuring the vocals of producer Matias Aguayo. It's not safe for work if you work in a straight-laced office. It is also not safe for work if you are a hormonally charged young teen.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nThis video, and the entirety of Gloss Drop, have this song making much more sense to me than it did on first listen. Saw their live set last week and I didn't even miss Braxton- the 6 foot projections of Matias Aguayo and Kazu Makino during their respective guest vocal appearances were almost cooler than them actually being there with Battles, and also fall into that \"clean weirdness\" category."}
{"text":"Exclusive K Flay Interview\n\nKristine Flaherty aka K Flay recently stopped by the Myspace office to discuss her unique style, new material, and life on the road. Her musical career has definitely moved rather quickly this past year or so, and the future looks pretty bright. K Flay has an original style with lyrical content that you would not expect to come from this innocent looking Standford University graduate. She is definitely not your typical emcee.\n\nNow you posses many talents. You are a singer, songwriter, lyricist, and you play a few instruments. Where does all of this musical talent stem from? .I think for the most part it's been like kind of an experience of trial and error and just a lot of things evolving out of the necessity. When I first started, I wanted to rap on things, but I didn't really have beats, so I was like, well, I better buy a keyboard and figure that out. Um, so yeah, it's\u2013it's been like a very natural evolution I think, in terms of kind of music stuff. And then you know, obviously there's probably like, you have to have a little bit of a predilection for something, but a lot of it feels like just practice and time and\u2014and really, you know, spending kind of the\u2014the late hours honing what you're doing and\u2014and getting better at it. . Who were some of your influences growing up? What would be the musical recipe for K Flay? .\nI really started listening to to hip-hop in a kind of concerted fashion when I came to California, and when I was 18 I think kind of the hip-hop component or hip hop spice would probably be Outcast \u2026 I was into them growing up and I really got back into them in college because I think they've been able to negotiate a lot of different kind of musical spaces. They do really creative interesting things, always remaining true to themselves, but like innovating constantly and I don't know, I just think\u2014they're one of a kind and one of the most remarkable artists out there in the last 25 years. Then that probably mixed with\u2013I'm like a huge kind of, not mid depressed, but like tortured female, like in the artist fan [sense]. So I listen to a lot of Liz Fair and Fiona Apple, Emily Haynes. So probably a little mix of that, half you know, Indie Girl, half weirdo hip-hop stuff. I'd definitely be one of those rotating racks. (laughs) . Now it's hard to place your music in one specific genre. How would you classify your own sound and style?\nI think like it's\u2013it's probably Indie hip-hop, but there's more of an electronic component than like kind of old school, um, Indie hip-hop. I mean, the beats aren't super traditional, you know, I think that's partly 'cause I don't totally know what I'm doing and I'm just sort of flying by the seat of my pants, but yeah, it's like hip-hop with a little bit of electronic and a little bit of Indie. . Do you remember you first performance and how that came about?\nMy first time ever performing was in college. I kind of just started doing music on a whim and a a friend of mine knew I was doing it and he was a more serious musician. I'd met him through another friend of ours and he was actually going on tour. He was like stopping at a school for a little bit. And he was supposed to play a show on campus at some like, you know, random event and he was like, \"yeah I can't do it, but I know this girl who kind of raps.\" So they called me up, and I performed. It was pretty intense. I never grew up thinking I would be a performer. I was pretty nervous, but it was more\u2014I had like this weird sensation halfway through I was like, like everyone's looking at me to do something, you know, and I felt like I kind of wasn't really doing anything that interesting. But, uh, yeah, that was my first show and then just kind of like evolves from there. .\n\nSo you graduated Stanford as a double Major in Psychology and Sociology. How did you balance music with your studies?\n\nYup, watch out ill cut you with a textbook. (laughs) I think for me the balance was really easy, because music was never the focus. It was like something I did as a stress reliever and there was a way to, you know, be with my friends and kind of have a laugh in a way. Then you know, after I graduated I was pretty burned out on school. I felt like that had been my focus for so long and I'd just been so like bogged down in my studies. I was working a job, but and few people started taking interest in what I was doing. I kind of was like, all right, well, I'll just see where it goes. About a year and a half after, it started to really kind of move forward. I got a booking agent and manager and all that stuff, so it's\u2013it's been like a really weird. It's like an extended somersault that started off with being pushed by a feather.\n\n. Sounds like someone wasn't getting much sleep?\nNo man. I will sleep when I'm dead. I'm so tired right now also (laugh) I never sleep. Actually, as a young kid I never slept either. I've always been like a, I don't know, not insomniac, but I just don't\u2014I never slept that much, you know, I stayed up late as a kid. .\n\nYou recently dropped an EP titled Eyes Shut. What was the concept behind the title?\n\nYeah, I'd been recording a bunch of songs, kind of with the idea of putting an EP out, but you know, letting it be a free form type of project and kind of looking at the material. I wanted to do something that was like fanatically very coherent, 'cause I think when you have an EP you don't want to be all over the place, you know, if it's just going to be five songs, which this one is. It's good to remain focused. And I was finding that a lot of the songs that I was writing were about this kind of grappling with engagement versus disengagement, you know, the desire to, that I feel in myself, to kind of just check out for whatever reason.Also a kind of simultaneous desire to not miss out on anything and to be kind of fully existing in a moment, which of course is impossible, since you can't experience everything. So it was about that tension and a lot of the people that I know who I love, I see both of those things too. Like just this kind of tendency towards apathy at times and I think, you know, it can be really easy to be apathetic. Like I've got a song on there called, We Hate Everyone, which is\u2013it's kind of like the, you know, haters anthem and I feel that way sometimes too, but it feels really easy to be a hater, like I can go in the Internet and be like, this sucks, like I hate this guy, you know.\n\n. Now you have shared the stage with some big names like Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, and even artists like 3OH3. How has the experience of the different audiences affected your approach and understanding for both crowds? .Yeah, I think anytime, you know, I'm an opening act, I try to be cognoscente of who the audience is for that main person and what they're probably going to like a little bit more. I mean, I think as an opener, your job is to get the crowd excited, to warm them up and to hopefully be a pleasant surprise. I think those are sort of the elite\u2013that's at least the way I look at it. So differently, for some of the more hip-hop stuff, it will be a little more of a hip-hop centric show, like for the 30H3 Tour, I did, um, there was a lot more like crowd participation, just 'cause it's younger kids and like that's what they want. They want to throw their hands up. I try to be aware of that, but it's been really cool, like watching bigger acts and how they run their operation, because you know hopefully one day I'll be able to run a similar operation and just seeing the ins and outs of that and how finely tuned a lot of those machines are. . Any crazy stories involving any of these artists or any words of wisdom you've taken from them? .I would say this, that what I've really taken from, it's been like\u2013I've opened up for tons of like different genres and different levels of artists, but the string running through it and the lesson to me is that the way you treat your opening act, really does say like a lot about the band. I think it says a lot about success in the future. You know and like even just taking 30H3, for example, those guys are total sweethearts. They're so nice and they really make an effort to interact with everybody who's, you know, on the cruise and on the tour and there were a lot people on that tour and they made everybody feel like really a part of it. So stuff like that, you know, is really nice and is the fun part of doing this, you know, when you get to work with really good people. . How about any crazy stories with yourself while on tour? .There's some questionable folks. Um, but actually, well, he's in the room right now, so I'll tell this story. Um, I was in in Paris for a show, this was like in the spring, I guess, and I was there with my manager and we had one day off and I'd never been to Paris. So he was like, yeah, let's rent a scooter, like let's drive around, which like in retrospect was a horrible idea. Like we both were like what? Like we should be dead, that this could not have happened. And I have like a studio session at 5:00 pm or something. And we rented the scooter like he's driving in the city, we don't know. I have like a tourist map, I'm like clinging for dear life and on the back of the thing, like we got completely lost. We got outside the city of Paris. We were in like an industrial warehouse south of the city like. And basically we entered our way at like 50 miles per hour in a Vespa to this session like at 4:59 pm. I got there like one minute before, so it was awesome. It doesn't sound as good as I'm relaying it, as it was, but it was pretty insane and like around the Arch de Triumph, there's like just this huge round about no lanes and I filmed it and it was just nuts. But that was pretty fun. I've had some interesting adventures in London too. And some adventures I'm not so proud of (laugh) . So with your very unique and like original style, you've seem to like really stay in your lane and you haven't really gone in any other direction, and your music comes off really authentic. What type of advice would you have for artists that strive to stay in their own lane as well?\nYeah, I think my advice would be, and I'm still definitely figuring this out myself, but is to trust your gut on things when they feel like sometimes stepping out of your comfort zone is good, because it leads to growth and you'll be better for that and better for it. But, I think if you have a sort of true feeling in your gut that something isn't you or really is antithetical to what you're about, you don't want to regret it in the end. And there've been things just like a few little things along the way where that's kind of happened and it's like you learn from those experiences, but I think ultimately, even if like the weirdest dude ever, who's like famous now or popular or whatever? Like everyone thought was a weirdo and then somehow they stopped thinking that person was a weirdo. And I think like the public and audiences, they come around and when the times right and when you're messaging your sort of image, not in a fake way, but like really what you're about. There will come a time when that connects with kind of the broader vibe of the world. And when that happens, I think you can be really great, but it's people\u2014people Smell out fake stuff at this point. There's just so much music. There's so many people really trying to do it and if you're kind of inauthentic, I think people are really turned off by that. It's like doing something the easy way and then it doesn't last. .\n\nFun Facts .

{"text":"Upon listening to Chet Faker's 'Thinking In Textures', I felt a mixture of love, loss and sexual frustation. I realise that's a strange combination but as one kind YouTube user put it, Chet Faker's music is \"baby making music\". Pure and simple, the fusion of electronica soul combined with personal tales of romance and tragedy just make you want to combat that bottle of tequila and do some seriously naughty things. But instead of regretting your actions in the morning, just press play on 'Thinking In Textures' and you've instantly got a reasonable explanation for the person in your bed and the scratch marks on their back.\n\nNormally, that situation would make you feel cheap and, if that person is particularly on the unattractive side, full of regret. However, 'No Diggity' is the perfect soundtrack to change that regret into ecstasy. Hey, you just got laid! 'No Diggity' reminds you of all the positives that can be found amongst the dirty residue of the morning after the night before. You'll be dancing around your bedroom in your pants in no time, I promise you.\n\n\"I'm Into You' and 'Cigarettes and Chocolate' are best listened to when the sun is shining and you're walking over London Bridge, overlooking the River Thames. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you could listen to these songs elsewhere but for me; they worked best in that situation. There's something largely enjoyable about listening to these songs through headphones, strolling across such a beautiful setting. While everybody else was hurrying around me, desperate to reach their destination with their only soundtrack being London buses driving past, I took great pleasure in knowing that during the 5.24 minutes that 'Cigarettes and Chocolate' played for, I literally had no cares in the world, except for wanting to know just how great music like this is made.\n\n'Terms and Conditions' and 'Love and Feeling' caught my attention instantly. These songs sums up the E.P in a simple 8 minutes and captures Chet Faker's sound perfectly; they're possibly the songs that imprisons Chet Faker's personal tales the best. They're honest, the lyrics fit brilliantly with the music and while his beard disguises his identity, these songs expose Chet Faker's character immediately.\n\nThere couldn't be a more perfect end to the E.P than 'Solo Sunrise' and 'Everything I Wanted\" \u2013 they combine the night before, the morning after and the feelings that come with both situations. As the E.P finishes, you're left with a feeling that only the actions from the night before can encapsulates but at the same time, you're also left with the bittersweet memories that the morning after brings. That tiny feeling of regret you're feeling? Blame it on the E.P ending, that's exactly what I'm doing.\nThis E.P is perfect for those that like particularly awkward situations, sunshine and really fucking good music."}
{"text":"Wednesday, August 31, 2011\n\nIf I'm given a choice between punk and New Wave, I'll take New Wave every time. But how about bands like the Buzzcocks, and the Only Ones, and the Undertones, who straddle the divide and then throw in a bunch of addictive poppy hooks to rein in the alienation just a bit? Canada's Diodes were one of the best of these hybrid outfits. You can find their songs on both punk and power pop compilations. It might be that their split personality, which defied easy categorization, was the reason they remained so obscure. They remind me of another very good and somewhat obscure Canadian band, the Barracudas, who were one part punk, one part pop, at home in neither camp, and so a stranger in both. Music that's difficult to label might be more interesting than easily identifiable product, but it also makes the stuff much more difficult to mass market. Too bad for the Diodes. I like their sound a lot, even if it's punky 'tude takes things a bit outside my normal crotchety comfort zone. Tired of Waking Up Tired has enough ennui to keep your mohawk as sharp as nails, but it's also tight, melodic, and devilishly catchy. And the thing is, who isn't tired of waking up tired? The song's sentiment gets at a universal problem in the modern world..."}
{"text":"INTERVIEW: Sebadoh Jason Loewenstein (Bass\/Vocals) (Sup Pop\/Sire Records) By: Alex Steininger Being one-half of the former MTV buzz band Folk Implosion, Sebadoh front man Lou Barlow has seen his fair share of success. But he keeps coming back to Sebadoh, which seems to be his main priority. With a new record out on Sire Records (through a deal with Sub Pop), and their indie fan base going strong, Sebadoh seems to be on top of the world. I sat down with Jason Loewenstein and we talked about the band's current tour, how it feels to be on a major, and other issues pertaining to the band.\n\nAlex: Describe your sound on the record, and then describe the live sound. How are they similar and how are they different?\n\nJason: I usually try to think of how things are going to sound on stage later, and not get too advantageous, because then we won't be able to do it. Like, if I put tambourine on the record, we can't do that live, so I better not do it. But on this record, we put tons and tons of shit on it and then figured out later as to whether or not we'd be able to pull it off. The difference is now we're not able to make as much noise, but we can allude to a certain amount of noise. We know there is supposed to be tambourine there, so we play our respective instruments to show that, because in our heads the tambourine is there. So, in a way, it makes it a little bit different. We're sort of assuming a lot more is going on, so it makes it bigger than the sum of its parts. At least to my ears, and that's the difference.\n\nAlex: A lot of bands will incorporate strings, horns, acoustic guitars, and a variety of other instruments on the studio version, creating a very poppy style, and then they'll transform the song into more of a rocker live. Do you try to go for the straight conversation and try to pull the song off live the way it is on the disc?\n\nJason: Well, I think I used to be more concerned with that. Now, at this point, I realize it's going to have to be different. Some of the songs that Lou wrote, that are really rocking on the record, we're doing really quiet now. Like what you said, you're just changing the dynamics of the song to keep things interesting for yourself. I mean, you're going to be playing the song five hundred times a year. Things do change like that. If we get good at playing it a certain way, we'll throw a wrench into the plan, like \"Let's play it quiet tonight.\" That way, for people who see us a few times, they won't be like, \"They do this every fucking time I see them.\"\n\nAlex: Your press material describes your live sound as being like a snowflake, no two are alike. Is that pretty much hold true for you guys?\n\nJason: Yeah, but it must be like that for any band to some degree, unless they're really like throwing down the same set list every night. Well, we're doing that too, though. We have a certain body of songs we're playing, but we'll change the order every night. But, no two venues are alike and no two audiences are alike, so it's not really our faults. We try to switch and change to the environment. There are too many bands that will come into any situation and try to act the exact same way, and it makes them look ridiculous. So we kind of decided, although we never said this to each other, but it just became a band ethic, to be a good musician you have to completely adjust to the new environment each time. If the audience is giving you nothing back, it might be because they're trying to be insanely respectful. Or it might be because they're completely bored out of their tits. It's hard to tell. You have to react to the non-reactions, too. It's really weird politics.\n\nAlex: Do you think the break-ups, side-projects, and all the other band history has helped strengthen you and make you a stronger band today?\n\nJason: The fact that we're still playing together after Lou has had hits with Folk Implosion, and he still works with John Davis and stuff, the fact he keeps coming back to Sebadoh and takes it as seriously as he does is a testament to the fact that he doesn't really try anything else. He knows what else is out there for him, but he keeps wanting to come back and play rock music with me and Russ, or me and Rob or, at one point, me and Eric. That affects me and makes me feel good, because I know he really wants to be here; he could be off doing whatever he wants and he wants to be here.\n\nAlex: What are your band goals for 1999?\n\nJason: Keep our attitudes straight. We have enough good songs to keep going, so our goals are kind of basic. Try to keep learning songs at soundcheck and trying to make it through the year with a clear head. Also, staying happy and making it through the tour with everybody still good with each other, because with the band and the people we have touring with us, one of the most important things is to make sure one person isn't unhappy and spreads it throughout the bus. I mean, it's going to happen a few times this year when someone is unhappy and starts to drag, but I believe it's very important to pick them back up and make sure everyone on the bus is happy.\n\nAlex: When someone gets down, is it contagious?\n\nJason: Wicked contagious! The thing is, it is contagious, but it breeds other things. When someone is bummed out in a traveling crew, especially this one, because we're so insanely sensitive of each other (in a good way) because we're so sensitive of each other, if someone gets bummed out eventually someone will be like \"Are you OK?\" and then it turns into \"Is it me?\" It's a bunch of baby shit, but it is a part of human nature. So, when one person does that, it's like, \"Now there is a depressed person, a jealous person, and someone is angry that those two people get to play that game.\" It's retarded. It's like a bunch of monkeys in a big cage that gets to roll across the country.\n\nAlex: Since the road is so hard, and is a lot of work, what do you do to alleviate some of those pressures and just kick back and have fun on the road?\n\nJason: As much humor as possible. No matter where or who this band travels with, we're always trying to keep the humor level up. There is only so far you can go with that, but we try to associate with people who are really funny. We have a friend named Mike Flood who always travels with us in the states, and I think he thinks it is his job in life to be a really funny guy. And he is, he is one of the most creative, funny people I know. When we first hired him it was a few years ago -- he was a friend of ours for years before that -- and when we got a real tour manager she asked us what his job was and we just didn't know, except that he was the guy that was funny. I mean, he did a lot of stuff for us, and always knew what to do, because his job was all over the place, but there wasn't one thing he was there for. But I think his technical title now is guitar tech.\n\nAlex: Is there any particular bill you guys prefer to play to another? Like, do you prefer playing with indie rock bands or pop bands over anything else?\n\nJason: It doesn't really matter. Integrity is the only thing that counts. I mean, even if I don't get it, if the integrity is there, we'll play with them. I don't even have to enjoy it for it to have integrity. I'm not saying that I know it all, because I don't, but what I'm trying to say is that even if I don't like it, but the integrity is there, I would much rather play with them over a band that has no integrity but everyone loves them. I'd rather torture the shit out of an audience with the people that really believe in what they're doing. We sometimes bring really noisy bands on tour with us. There is this band called Hairy Pussy that we brought on tour with us because we love them. But they're one of the most antagonistic bands out there. They have two guitar players with two strings on each guitar, and are making this weird sound that you can't really tell they have songs until you see them two nights in a row. And they do, so it is amazing.\n\nAlex: Does your crowd get into them?\n\nJason: Well, half will be like, \"I didn't believe this is happening. I thought they'd have some ding-ding-dong singy-songs.\" Then the other half is like, \"I don't believe this, I'm being ripped off.\" So, everyone gets a little life experience out of it.\n\nAlex: Is there any big road story that stands out in your mind?\n\nJason: Big road stories, let me think...\n\nAlex: Maybe witnessing a murder in Florida, having terrorists plant a bomb on the bus, some far out thing like that?\n\nJason: I've seen a dead body on tour. I've been nearly thrown in jail for months on tour, back in the old days when we...It was actually a long time ago. We came out here and our last gig was in Seattle, and we had a really long drive back home, so we asked someone to get us some weed. We got some weed and got pulled over in Wisconsin. Eric and I were asleep in the back and we got pulled over. Lou was very apologetic. We didn't have that much weed, it was just something to do at the hotels at night. So they searched the van and it was so dirty they didn't find it, or they just didn't want to look anymore because there was so much rubbish everywhere. But I was standing by the side of the road, and I was nineteen at the time, and kept thinking, \"I'm going to fucking jail and I'm only nineteen. This is my first cross-country tour, what the hell is going on? Oh wow, I could run through those bushes over there.\" It was like 1991, and it was the first time we had been featured on a magazine. It was called Puncture, and it had our picture on the cover. So we were all wowed, so we asked to get a stack of them and had them in the van. And I literally had pee running down my legs I was so scared; I really thought I was going to jail. I kept asking myself is Wisconsin was one of those zero tolerance places. Then the guy comes back from the van and has something behind his back. I was about ready to confess everything, because I thought we were busted, and at the last second he pulls out the magazine and goes, \"Can you sign this for me?\" I almost fucking fainted.\n\nAlex: Was he a fan or had he even ever heard of you guys?\n\nJason: No, he had never heard of us, he just saw us on the cover of a magazine and thought we were famous or something, so he probably wanted to get the magazine signed for his daughter. But we were like, \"Yes sir. Thank you sir.\" I hate the drug story, but it is also a good lesson. Do the speed limit if you're going to...(laughter). Lou was doing 82 or something like that. He kept apologizing. He was so freaked out. He thought he had put us all in jail by speeding.\n\nAlex: What do you guys enjoy and hate about the music industry?\n\nJason: I love being able to make a living at it. It's become my only job. And that we can do it on this comfortable bus, and we can afford to have some extra people with us to help us, is great. It's funny because it's so interdependent. The things I enjoy can't happen without the things I hate. Like on days when we have three or four interviews, have to do soundcheck, and then go and do a radio show, there just aren't enough hours in the day to sleep, do all this shit, and set your own stuff up. Those obligations are kind of a pain-in-the-ass, and I don't really understand what they do for us in the long run, except that we have met the station, and they have face recognition, so maybe they'll play our single. Then the next station looks at their play list and it becomes this copycat city. Then, the people who really helped us out in the beginning, the college radio stations, even Sub Pop ignored them. I mean, we're working with Sire now, and I'd expect them to ignore those stations, but Sub Pop did it too. Yeah, I mean, most of our radio obligations from the last record were all KROQ style, commercial\/alternative things. That's confusing to me, because the people who really helped us out in the beginning, and the fact that we don't sell a shit load of records, yet we can still afford to play a place as big as La Luna or a 500-600 person place in Seattle is weird. We're not selling a million records, you know? College radio and our ethic for touring did that for us, I think. And now we're ignoring college radio stations. It's just adjusting to someone else's ideas of what your band should be. I'm not really fighting it, because I don't think it's a big calamity, but I wish I understood it better. Why do people think we need to ignore the college stations? That's what got us here.\n\nAlex: Yeah, that is kind of weird. Especially since you can't get a video on MTV these days or anything like that, so you need the grassroots approach to keep you alive.\n\nJason: No, we can't payola a video on to MTV. For the last record we did a video that cost 125,000 dollars and it got paid twice. We're talking professional, expensive Hollywood video.\n\nAlex: 120 Minutes?\n\nJason: (Laughter) Yeah! The middle of the night on Sunday. Tour Manager: Filled with a bunch of characters that who knows who they were. Some people falling in love, a bunch of retards in a bowling alley...\n\nJason: We had a total walk-on part in it. It was one of those things that are totally fucked up, expensive film story line. The guy was good at what he does, but it was very impersonal. That was our fault, though, because we told them to stop bitching at us for making our own videos and to make the kind of video they wanted to make. And now we're paying for it, and will be for the next eight years with our record sales. It's funny, you have to do that first to bitch about it later. Now if they ask us to spend $120,000 on a video we can say \"Absolutely not! Give us a reason.\" And we can be totally straightforward without being a jerk. We can ask for an explanation before anyone spends a dime on another video. But, before you do it, you can't really say because you don't really know from experience. Its just politics like that that I'm not psyched about. We had to spend $120,000 before we could tell anyone not to do it again. Even though we could have told them that before, we didn't really know from experience. That much money in advertising space could have gone a lot further. Although I don't understand it as well as they do, apparently!\n\nAlex: Is there anything in the band's past you would change? Like the making of the $125,000 video?\n\nJason: I don't know if I would want to change that, because now I know what it is all about. I wish the lesson came cheaper, I wish we made a $55,000 mistake, but now I know the impact of that. That video could have made us, in a way, but it's less than fifty\/fifty. Way less, because it goes through a panel of people who pretty much pick whose going to go and whose not.\n\nAlex: What are the highest and lowest points the band has experienced so far?\n\nJason: That's a tough one. We'll start low and go high (hopefully). Whenever there is a fucked up, petty argument, that is a pretty low point. There hasn't been too many of those, though. There has to be a lower point. For me, the lowest point was early on when I first joined the band we'd practice for a couple of months and then Eric would get us a gig in New York and tell me I wasn't in the band anymore. The money goes better two ways then three, and I thought he was the biggest creep. Now it sounds creepier to me than it felt at the time, I was just like, \"Whatever. But you want me to come and practice next week, even though you just told me I can't come to the gig?\" It was really weird. I was just disappointed. I was wondering what kind of guys they were. But I was so psyched to be there, I just let it go. I just did not want to play in a ska band, and didn't want to just have to take what I could get, so I went after these guys after I heard them. It wasn't really in a social climbing way, I was just like, \"This is turning me on,\" and it wasn't happening in my area. I thought it might just keep me alive a bit longer and make me excited about life. And the other low point probably came from Eric as well, because we finally booked a two-week tour of the East Coast and I was so happy to be going out of state to be playing music. I thought I finally had become a pro. Then two days, or maybe a week before we left, Lou came over to my house with a letter that said Eric had quit the band and was moving to Portland. It said, \"By the time you read this I'll be midway between here and Portland on a bus.\" I was just like, \"Fuck!\" I had almost gotten to go on tour. But it worked out, and became one of the better things to have happened in my life, because I had to learn bass and now I'm making a living out of doing it.\n\nAlex: What made you want to be in a band?\n\nJason: I had always been playing around with music, and I was not liking high school at all. I really wouldn't go very much, and had started to play music with a few people. Then I was talking to a friend of my mom's one night and they were all drinking. He came into my room, and this guy was a huge jazz head, and I don't know much about jazz, but he was a big time music fan. He worked at a record store and he was forty. He came in and asked me if I wanted to take drum lessons, because he knew these great jazz guys, and I wasn't really into the idea of lessons. Then he asked me what I wanted to do with my life and why I was being so non-committal about it, because he told me I could get something out of this, and I was like, \"I don't know. I'm young, it doesn't matter.\" Then he asked me what else I had going for me, and I sat there and was like, \"I can skateboard.\" It really turned the lights on in the bar at 3am, and I realized I didn't really have anything else going for me. This was something I really loved doing, and there was a slight possibility that, even if it wasn't making me money, it would keep me happy while I was making money some other way. I thought it was a really good question and was like, \"Thanks for asking me that.\"\n\nAlex: What goes into good music making for you?\n\nJason: Trying to finish what you start. That's my new lesson. I used to not finish. I would get really embarrassed and just stop. As evidence has shown from the last five records.\n\nAlex: What inspires the band to write songs?\n\nJason: To try and make sense out of our surroundings. If not that, to do at least something. Sometimes I'll write a song and have no idea what I'm going to get out of it, except that I know I need to get out of this situation. I'll go into a music mode and just block everything else out. It's like doing drugs. It's a denial mechanism but, in my opinion, something good comes out of it. With drugs though, something good rarely comes out of it. Not that I'm against drugs, my perspective is just very different on them now compared to when I was 17. History repeats itself with those types of things and it just gets boring.\n702"}
{"text":"Most of you may know Chairlift from their uber-mega hit a year and a half ago called \"Amanaemonesia.\" Perhaps you even participated in the dance contest to recreate the iconic routine.\n\nI, unfortunately, let the band go in one ear and out the other. It's not totally my fault though; at the same time Summer Camp was whispering \"I Want You\" while Niki and The Dove filled my ears with a \"Gentle Roar,\" and everyone was predisposed to M83\u2032s trek through \"Midnight City.\" My ears were busy, man.\n\nSo, I was a bit surprised to find the band stripping away the manic energy in their recent demo and replacing it with a bit of bedroom-pop. \"Grownup Blues\" utilizes a simple piano arrangement interspersed with fuzz and what sounds like the clatter of a coffee shop. Coupled with the lyrical content, the production turns so insular you feel like you are swimming in the rush of the singer's thoughts.\n\nAnd the lyrical content really matters to me. Much of what never stuck with me about \"Amanaemonisia\" was that the neologism inspired in the title didn't have a purpose other than that it sounded okay in Blondie-like hooks. But \"Grownup Blues\" masterfully uses the carnivalesque to give voice to the despondency of the American\/European lost generation of 20-somethings.\n\nIt's another rare example of \"recession rock\" \u2013which is still a genre of music that I find so perplexingly absent (and after my post, others began to wonder of its absence as well). If Shufflers know of any indie songs in the last 3-4 years that deal with a young person's perception of the recession, leave them in the comments and I'll try to create a list out of them."}
{"text":"Rogers Sisters \"The Invisible Deck\" (Too Pure\/Hostess)\n\nRock musicians manifest the confrontational mode in many different ways, and New York's The Rogers Sisters utilize most of them. A classic power trio that has absorbed every trick the configuration has yielded over the years, the group works up from the kind of precision noise that sisters Jennifer and Laura practiced in math-rock band Ruby Falls, and merges it with the more prosaic priorities of bassist Miyuki Furtado, who grew up listening to Iron Maiden. The result is something like Sonic Youth without the pretensions to art, a controlled chaos with a darkly comic spirit and the gut appeal of pop metal.\n\nLess overtly political than their first two CDs, \"The Invisible Deck\" still gets in your face with its relentless instrumental and vocal attack. \"The Clock\" is little more than a countdown song, but with each hour that's struck the intensity increases tenfold. Even when they slow the tempo down and add a flute on the psychedelic \"The Littlest World,\" fuzz guitar rumbles out of the netherworld and eventually swallows everything. Here's a band who has mastered the art of melodic feedback, making confrontation fun."}

{"text":"Schr\u00f6dinger's Bookshelf\n\nRook, C'mon (EP) (Fucking Kid Records, 1999)\n\nRook is another one of those fascinating little discoveries that I love to spot and single out for attention. In this case, they came to me by way of Folk Tales' publisher, who sent C'mon to me with a side note stating that he thought I'd enjoy them.\n\nTo my pleasant surprise, he was right. I didn't just like Rook, I loved them. And coming from me, that's high praise indeed. You see, I have a somewhat unfortunate flaw. I don't like Celtic music on the whole. Oh, sure, I've been known to enjoy specific bands, or certain songs, or some styles. But on the whole, I'm not really a Celtic music fan. I don't know why, but after a while, it all starts sounding the same to me.\n\nRook, on the other hand, is a refreshing breath of difference in a great many ways. For one thing, they satisfy my FHL rule about music.\n\nAnyway, I learned this about Rook from the liner notes: They're a Tacoma, Washington based group, formed in 1996 by Shane Scot (guitars and lead vocals), and Tim McCarthy (bagpipes, backing vocals). They stayed a duo for several years, working as a studio band. They picked up several more musicians in early 1999, in the form of John Rice (drums, percussion), Sarah Roark (fiddle, backing vocals), and Gary Thompson (bass). Once they worked the kinks out, Rook as we know it was born, \"a five-piece band ready to play live, record albums, and establish a fan base.\" C'mon is their first album.\n\nUnfortunately, while everything on C'mon is original to Rook's repertoire, it's a short album, consisting of a mere five songs and a bonus \u2026 er, track that has to be heard to be believed. Also, unfortunately, they're noted as being released on the dubiously-named \"Fucking Kid Records.\"\n\nDon't let either of those facts worry you. Rook has some serious potential, and a good future ahead of them, if they can maintain the quality I detected in what I've heard.\n\nThe first song, \"Christine's Troubles,\" has a story to go with it, with the Christine of the title being Rook's original fiddler, a lady who, shortly after being recruited, was evicted, engaged, and laid off, in that order. The song itself is a lively, fast-paced bagpipe-and-others tune that fully conveys the feeling of events spiraling out of control. It starts off quietly, with the bagpipes bringing us into the song slowly, setting up the anticipation. Then, after a suitable pause, it launches into a much less restrained attitude, the other instruments joining in. Round and round it goes, getting louder, faster, and harder with each moment, until finally, it pauses for another bagpipe solo, and then the other instruments come crashing back in, faster and faster, harder and harder, slamming home with a final push and crash.\n\nLord, but I'd hate to try and dance to it. I can't even begin to convey the power of the song. On the basis of that song alone, I'm a fan.\n\nRook doesn't slack off, either. The second song, \"Look So Long\" is a demented little tale of a man who leaves a woman, and then tries to convince her to take him back. Can we say, \"Ooops?\" This song introduces the talented vocals section of Rook's abilities. You know how some bands can't sing, and shouldn't be allowed to? Well, Rook can sing. This tune's lively in an entirely different way, and they manage to make their instruments speak for them. And trust me, anyone who's ever been jilted by a capricious love will applaud the way this song turns out.\n\nThe third song is \"Ironman,\" named after the traditional J. Scott Skinner strathspey, but with Rook's unique flavor added to it. It's mainly notable for being the first collaboration between McCarthy and Scot. It's something of a letdown compared to the first two songs, until you get about a minute into the bagpipe opening and the guitar tears in with a bass roar to undercut the traditional atmosphere with a modern feel. Not so disappointing now, if you ask me.\n\nNext up is \"Gypsy Charm,\" described as a love-sick song with a pipe solo worth checking out. Rook slows down for this one, reintroducing us to their vocals, and their sense of humor. This is another one to dance to, as long as you can keep up.\n\nThe last song is \"Dreaming of Spain.\" The liner notes state that the first two songs in the set were inspired by the music of Galicia (described as a Celtic region at the northwest tip of Spain), while the song ends with a traditional Scottish jig, \"Atholl Highlanders\". Like other Rook songs, it starts slowly, focusing on bagpipes, and then opens up with energy and enthusiasm. Ah, percussion. There is a drum solo nearly four minutes into the set that simply kicks ass, and it's immediately followed with a powerful followup into a strong finish.\n\nThe bonus track has no name that I can tell, but if I was to name it, I'd call it \"Messing Around,\" since that's basically what they do for about thirty seconds. It fades in some seconds after the previous song fades out, messes around, introduces us to the possible origins of \"Fucking Kid,\" and then dances on out the door.\n\nWould I recommend Rook? Oh, in a heartbeat. They're a rare cut above the best, one I thoroughly enjoyed, and one I'll listen to again quite happily in the future.\n\nYou can check them out at their Web site. Now, the site wasn't accessible when I tried, but you may have better luck. If not, I'm sure someone here at Folk Tales knows how to find more Rook CDs. It's worth the effort, in my book."}

Similarly, The xx, an inherently minimalist, downplayed dream-pop duo, won the 2010 Mercury Prize (UK\/Ireland) for best album. Now, for their follow-up, all ears are pricked up for band that's barely making a sound. Something that wasn't there on the London group's debut resonated; maybe like how what's not shown in a scary movie is always the worst, since it leaves it up to your fevered imagination. The spaces between sounds augment the beauty of the woozy and wispy duets of Oliver Sim and Romy Madley-Croft with aerodynamic trip-hop tropes, delicate synth mists, low rolling bass, celestially whirring guitars and bare beats. And it helps that their sighed serenades are the warmest, most prominent element in their pop's design. Take their new tracks for what they are: bittersweet, ultra-sleek post-apocalyptic torch songs striking a strange voyeuristic vibe with relentlessly intimate lyrics. Their hearts are heavy enough to weigh the tracks down, surely, but the listener grows anxious for a stretch after too much slow-dance swoon"}

{"text":"The Lonesome Heroes are an Austin music favorite, crafting thoughtful lyrics and memorable melodies, avoiding the clich\u00e9s of American country music gone pop. Live performances of the core band (the duo of Rich Russell and Landry McMeans) are sparsely instrumental yet intensely engaging, and their recording and touring band creates a lush sound on the cusp of being cosmic. Imagine riding along the Texas countryside with a friend, then marveling at the lights of Marfa with several more friends. The Lonesome Heroes are an experience you don't want to miss.\n\nThe Lonesome Heroes have recorded an EP, Don't Play To Lose, and many stand alone recorded and live singles, some now available on the band's website: \n\nDon't miss The Lonesome Heroes live on the Cherry Stage (inside), 1:00 pm."}
{"text":"ROACH may announce himself as being from Edinburgh, Scotland, these days but the voice he does it in remains the cumulative product of generations of Virginians, raised mostly in the church but not above a little off-the-books private enterprise. It's a voice that lends almost unshakeable authority to the songs Roach sings, although Granddaddy, for one, also rings true because Roach researchers know that his grandfather really did operate an illicit liquor trade and his own personal, small-scale mint.\n\nAn 'old soul in a young man's body' tone is only part of Roach's singing strength. As he soared off in praise of the night sky as seen from a Caribbean island on Barrio Moon or lamented humans' inability to learn from history on Pleistocene, the title track from his superb latest album, he hit strings of pure notes of which a choirboy would have been proud. Well, a choirboy who had a mischievous streak. Like his fellow Glasgow Americana guest Eliza Gilkyson, he can even add a \"whistling\" solo and make it sound like an instrument. Roach's subjects aren't always wholesome and his characters aren't always innocent but sitting with just his guitar for company and occasionally singing a cappella and using the room's acoustics to fullest effect, he showed that rare ability to transport the listener to the heart of the action, whether it be the San Francisco streets he once drove around as a cabbie, or his mentor, New York folkie Jack Hardy's Greenwich Village intimate songwriting workshops, or the \"domestic\" he conjures up in his allegorical marriage of a merman and a sea lion."}
{"text":"Interview #71: The Sweet Chap\n\nSun, 2005-10-30 15:06\n\nWith downloads now officially outselling all other singles formats, it would seem the time is ripe for internet-based labels like Protest and artists like The Sweet Chap to rise to the forefront of the music scene. I Like Music caught up with Mike Comber aka The Sweet Chap as he released his latest single Rummage.\n\n\"I Like Music because\u2026 it does something for me! It makes me feel electric and enables me to describe myself.\" The Sweet Chap\n\nILM: Your new single, Rummage was released online via Protest this week. Can you give us your own personal description of it?\n\nSweet Chap: It's a song about frustration for me; frustration in a relationship when people get really petty with each other over a period of time when you've been together for a long time, and have a go at each other over such minute things. It's just that frustration and boredom about being in a relationship, and seeing other people in that kind of relationship and it's quite hard to watch. And everyone's been there.\n\nILM: Of all the Disco For Domestic tracks, which one did you have the most fun making?\n\nSweet Chap: Probably my most favourite is Delicate. It's one of the saddest songs on there. I just got it and it felt nice when I was singing it; it felt like the mood I was trying to portray came across really well, and it really meant something to me. Even though it's probably the most ambiguous song out of all of them (they're all quite ambiguous and I want to keep it like that), but the lyrics just came out and it just felt right everything about it; whatever it's about I don't know, so it was very satisfactory creatively.\n\nILM: What piece of music hardware or software could you not live without?\n\nSweet Chap: Logic and a computer. This album was recorded on a PC that I built complete, not being a nerd, but I got this old PC and built it up and the software I use on it is Logic. In terms of writing if you're a writer, you need a keyboard and my favourite keyboard is a Korg MX 2000, that's one of my babies. It's really old with models' analogue keyboards from the 70s, so it's great, it's fat, its thick and great for synth bass which I love as well.\n\nILM: Brighton has influenced you notably, what's the best and worst thing about Brighton?\n\nSweet Chap: Brighton is very good to grow up in; once you're in your early twenties the social life there is incredible, and you learn so much\u2026 you learn about the dark side of life, going out and getting drunk and going to clubs and meeting people. So the social life is incredible and brilliant, but I also think it's quite a false place and can be quite pretentious. I think it's changed a lot and so many people move in and move out. But when I was young there was a really crusty period, where you had dreads coming down and playing bongos on the beach, but they disappeared after a while, and there was another new group. But at the moment I think it's quite pretentious. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it's got a lot of style and vision, but I'm not sure how deep it goes after that really. But the live music scene is getting a lot better than it was, so that's fantastic. There's such a big DJ movement there too. Everyone's a DJ in Brighton. You'll ask people what they do and they're like, 'I'm a DJ'. But being a musician it's quite nice that people are getting more into their bands.\n\nILM: It's been said, and I agree, that it's like \"eavesdropping in on a private musical conversation between man and his mind.\" Can you describe the Sweet Chap process of making such beautiful evocative music?\n\nSweet Chap: Well it all starts off with an acoustic guitar. I call myself a singer\/songwriter, but also a producer\/performer. I start off with a riff in my head and then I need to intensify it, I need to be eccentric, because that's how I feel about music, it has to be eccentric and slightly insane, and the only way I can get that and express myself in that way is to use electronic music: samples, beats, synths and synthetic sounds. I just love it and that really signifies how I'm feeling and expresses my emotions. So I concoct that together and often juxtapose sweet music against quite abrupt music and that's how it forms. I might play a simple riff on the guitar and think how can I create that electronically, and you can get a really nice end result, and I like doing that. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But it's great to get creative in that way.\n\nILM: What's your current favourite song to play live?\n\nSweet Chap: I love them all, I really do. We're playing some new songs that are really refreshing and aren't even on that album. But from Disco For A Domestic\u2026 Rummage, we love playing that. It's a serious song, quite sad and downbeat. But it's nice and we really put our hearts and souls into playing it. And Superman Three, that's one of my favourite to play out live. It's just so lazy.\n\nILM: What's your favourite live experience as a punter?\n\nSweet Chap: I see so many good bands. But Radiohead in Fife when I was about 18 just blew me away, that was a brilliant experience. To see a band that just blew me away live was fantastic. They're such a good band and they're a big influence. And Elliot Smith, we saw him about a year before he killed himself, and I've always been a big fan of him as a singer\/songwriter. That was great to see him, he was brilliant live.\n\nILM: In 2004 you partnered with Kazaa and 50,000 people downloaded your Disco For A Domestic album, how did that come about?\n\nSweet Chap: We approached them, me and my management company. We saw the Internet format of getting your music heard, and we liaised with Kazaa and it got on the site and people downloaded it for free. I believe some music should be free to a certain extent, as a kid I would often record music onto tape, but it didn't stop me going out and buying the album, so there's a free culture of music. I was amazed and really happy that people had downloaded the songs from all over the world. So we definitely wanted to be part of the Internet as a way to distribute songs. It's really exciting to be on an Internet-based record label (Protest Recordings). You don't just have to release an album how it's recognised at the moment, as a collection of songs on a CD. You can change it on the Internet, you can release three songs now and then three songs a while later and still release an album. Also, if you're an artist and you've got a song you can release it over the Internet straight away, so creatively it's brilliant.\n\nILM: What advice do you have for young musicians trying to get into the industry?\n\nSweet Chap: You've got to be strong at first. If you know you're a good enough writer and believe in yourself and others do, then get your CDs out there and get a manager, that's really important. Everyone needs a manager,. All the admin stuff can kill the creative side for an artist, so you get someone who's interested in managing the business side, that's a big thing. So get a good manager and take it from there.\n\nILM: Novelty Mouse Mat is about a workaholic (such as myself). How do you relax?\n\nSweet Chap: I'll be honest, I go to the pub. That's my favourite place and I go down to Brighton a lot. I've got a ten year old daughter, so I go down there a lot and look after her. Well, she looks after me. It's the nature of the job that there's a lot of drinking and going out at gigs, so it can get a over the top sometimes, and she's the stability that I need.\n\nILM: Can you describe your favourite place on earth?\n\nSweet Chap: The New Forest, Hampshire.\n\nILM: What is in your CD player right now?\n\nSweet Chap: I'm quite into I Am Kloot at the moment actually. I saw them at Glastonbury and they're a really great band. I've just finished listening to Gods Are Monsters, and it's a really good album. And a bit of Muse as well. They blow me away live. Really influenced by the way they play, they're such a good band, such good musicians, he can sing really well, great guitarist and pianist, great songwriters. Really energetic and quite fierce as well.\n\nILM: Please tell me your favourite tune that makes you chill out.\n\nSweet Chap: A Tom Waits song on his second album, The Ghost Of Saturday Night, it's called The Heart Of Saturday Night and is such a beautiful piece of music; really free. It's about a guy who goes out on a Saturday night and tries to have a good time and ends up laying in the gutter somewhere really drunk, and he hasn't had a good night, but that's just typical, trying to go out and have a good time.\n\nILM: Future plans?\n\nSweet Chap: It's really exciting. Rummage might be the last single, because we've got the album coming out, but I've got a backlog of new material that's at demo stage now, so we're looking to properly take these down to the studio and really beef them up, so we're looking forward to starting releasing the new stuff off that with Protest. That's going to be fantastic"}
{"text":"SCV Interview with Matt Embree and Chris Tsagakis of RX Bandits\n\nSound Colour Vibration Interview\n\nOn the edge of an indefinite hiatus, Rx Bandits are wrapping up a consistent schedule of touring with a string of summer shows. They are completing their summer tour in the place that birthed the band, Southern California. Having crafted a sound with foundations in rock, reggae, punk, and ska, Rx has evolved with every album and influenced many others in the process. With a slew of side projects (i.e. Matt Embree's Love You Moon, Chris Tsagakis' Technology, Embree and Tsagakis both in The Sound of Animals Fighting, Steve Choi in Machines, etc.), the group is looking to stretch new musical limbs while giving others time to rest. I sat down with longtime friends and musical partners Matt Embree (Vocals\/Guitar) and Chris Tsagakis (Drums) to talk about collaborations, labels, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. -Zack Lazar\n\nThis tour has been blown a bit out of proportion. You guys said you were going on a break, and people started saying, \"they're over, this is the farewell tour!\". But really, isn't it more like an indefinate hiatus.\n\nMatt Embree: That's what it is, a hiatus. We're not breaking up.\n\nChris Tsagakis: We've been pretty consistent with touring for a long time.\n\nME: We're definitely not going to tour for a while, if ever. It's not our last shows forever, if we were going to do that we'd like make it something really beautiful and elegant, not that we're not. We'd do a last waltz type of thing you know, with film, and have all of our friends there.\nCT: It's hard to say that we would ever have a last show ever because none of us are going to go home and be like, \"well, I'm going to break my drumsticks and sell my drums and never play.\" This is our love and what we're going to do for the rest of our lives anyways.\n\nIn any case, you guys are going to be taking a break. How does it feel right now, and how do you think that will change as you near the California shows?\n\nME: Already, it's very flattering, the energy has been really great and positive, but already at shows multiple people are crying. I understand, it means a lot to me that our band\u2026 (shoulder shrug) we're an underground band. We have amazing fans, if not the best fans I've ever seen. I've never seen a band, maybe Alkaline Trio, with more fans with tatoos. I'm not trying to sound conceited or bragging, I'm just very flattered and very honored. I write lyrics that I'm looking to connect with people, it's just part of how I am, part of who I am. Chris and I both are introverts and I think that's why we love music so much, because that's part of how we connect socially. We have a small close group of friends, we're not all social butterflies. To get back to your question, heavy. We've got people flying out from Japan, we have kids flying out from South America, we have kids flying down from Canada, we have kids flying from the west coast. We have kids that are following every show in California. There's this kid outside from Guatamala, he just got his citizenship and saw us last night, and he's going to like 10 shows. It's like -I feel like we kind of are, even though we don't sound like those hippy jam bands- we can fit with that in the way we play and jam. That's why I think our fans are so amazing, they get it and they know every show is going to be different. They know it's not supposed to just sound like the record. We feed off of them, fans are part of the show. They sing, they give us that energy and we feed off it. If the crowd is dead and weird, we're going to be weird. They're part of the band. It's tough, but change is good and I embrace it. I love playing with these guys, they're my bros. Chris and I started this when we barely had any pubes.\n\nYou've been a fixture in the California music and culture scene for quite some time. You guys have been together for almost two decades, what are the biggest changes that you've seen in the art and music scene?\n\nME: Wow. The way I look at it is that now, to be honest, it's been about 11 years. Because before, Chris and I started the Pharmaceutical Bandits, and that's something people don't realize. Essentially we changed our sound, we knew we wanted to change our sound. What we didn't want to do was just throw our fans away, so we decided \"we're going to start calling it RX bandits from now on.\"\n\nCT: It was about being more serious. At the beginning we were just kids who wanted to have fun and play music, it was our dream to do that. And at some point, it became like, WOW, we might be able to make a living off of this. It was like, let's make a logo, pick a solid name, and start playing a little more serious music. The kind of music we had inside of ourselves. Not that we didn't have ska inside of us\n\nME: We loved playing ska and reggae because it was really huge in our scene back home. We both were interested in dancing, and that's something that kept in the band. Unfortunately people always seem to want to say ska, when they talk about us. Which is super bizarre because, there are these friends of ours and they have two or three ska songs but nobody ever says ska about them. Even Sublime, people didn't so much call them ska as much as hip hop or whatever. It's just because we came from that scene, but we've always kept that dance element. It was a great scene, that really helped us to mold the kind of show that's safe and positive, and not gender specific. We have hard stuff, but we want women and men to be together and not for women to be afraid when they're in the audience. If people want to dance rough, that's fine. If I see women dancing rough and rocking out with them, then cool. As long as it's not a situation where a bunch of dudes are running around and all the girls have to hang back because they're afraid of getting hit. That's not fair.\n\nCT: The thing that bums all of us, is that there used to be so many more independent venues. There used to be tons all over Califoria. Now it's like if you want to play in any big city, there are few options. There's the clear channel options, which for a lot of people are necessary evils.\n\nME: It's like sometimes, you can't play somewhere cool if you don't play Livenation. There are certain cities that Livenation has a stranglehold over and there's nothing you can do, but we try as hard as we can to never support that company.\n\nCT: It used to be that we would literally have friends our age, or younger, who'd open up venues. We'd do it in a house or an old strip mall somewhere. It doesn't seem like that really happens much anywhere. It'll probably come back, it goes in waves.\n\nME: It was also legislation. There were all of those skinheads going around starting fights.\n\nHow did the Sound of Animals Fighting come together? How did it go from a random experiment to what it is now?\n\nCT: Rich Balling has been behind turning it into the phenomenon you might say, maybe that's too big of a word. I refered to it as an art project. We were just like, let's throw some stuff down, let's experiment with shifts, let's just do something. Rich took it, ran with it, and before we knew it\u2026\n\nME: Rich was essentially the label and the manager, and his contacts, like I had never seen Anthony [Green] but he was in a So Cal band, Saosin. Rich had an inkling that Anthony didn't want to do hardcore stuff anymore, and he loved his voice. So literally I wasn't even supposed to be in the project. It was just supposed to be kind of this superband sort of thing.\n\nCT: in the beginning Rich had me come down and I played drums for like 5 hours, and he recorded it. At that point I don't think he had any kind of plan in mind to tell me, it was just \"play drums\", and later we'll figure out the rest. I don't think anyone had any kind of big plan in mind at all.\n\nME: We just thought it'd be cool. What happened was that Chris did these jump parts that were just insane. The other thing was the other guitar players we had in mind from some hardcore and screamo bands, none of them could play to it. None of them knew what to do, so they sent me the ProTools file, and I recorded all of the guitar parts in four days.\n\nCT: We've always had this connection.\n\nME: This telepathic, bizarre\u2026when you've played forever that's how it is. From the first day I played with Chris, I felt a connection, I don't know if he did. It was like this guy likes all of the same music as me.\n\nCT: We just started playing and it was like, \"it goes like this,\" and I knew when you were going to change. The music kind of wrote itself.\n\nME: Rich told me, \"Hey man you got four days.\" So I just got in there. There are some parts that are just crazy, and it was like, ok if Chris wants to take it there I'll take it there too. It was kind of rag tag, and it all just came together. On the last record, Ocean and the Sun, Chris and I just recorded it all live in a studio in my garage, and we over-dubbed all these other parts. Chris played keyboard and stuff.\n\nCT: The actual first song, was a loop that I made from a jam that we did.\n\nME: Like in a real dirty room backstage somewhere.\n\nCT: I threw some extra keyboards on, Anthony sang on it, and it turned out to be a cool song. There were a few other ones on there that were experimental stuff I did with drums and gave to [Matt], similar to first album. Like \"Uzbekistan\", and that one that [Matt] sang on.\n\nME: Yeah, Rich was like, \"Anthony didn't sing on that one for some reason, can you sing on it?\".\n\nYou guys were really secretive about the project, and that was at least in part due to record company obligations. How was that a part of the creative process?\n\nME: It was to avoid preconceived notions. Because as lame as it is, rock music snobs are like, \"Oh, it's someone from Rx Bandits\", or some of these scenester-heads are like, \"I'm not going to listen to that because it's going to be lame\".\n\nCT: We had more ska connotation attached to our name at that point.\n\nME:We had just barely done The Resignation.\n\nThis country has seen a lot of changes, both sociocultural and musically, as you've grown together. Given your music's outspokenness regarding political issues, I'd assume your personal political dialogue has also evolved over time. Has it?\n\nME: Funny thing is, we don't really talk about politics much. We all kind of agree with each other, so at practice sometimes we'll say something like, \"Did you hear about this shit\". But we're all preaching to the choir. We all feel things that are liberal, we all think things that are conservative.\n\nCT: Liberal is a word that has its own connotation, but it's almost more like\u2026futurism. At some point someone was like, \"Black people shouldn't be slaves\", that person was thinking ahead of everybody else. I dont' think that we necessarily feel that this is our opinion and it's a political decision about this and that, it's more like there are certain issues that are just going to go away eventually. Like, injustices and general wrongs in the world. It seems just like a \"doy\" idea.\n\nME: If we want to continue existing on this planet, there are specific things that we need to do. I think anyone can see that. We need to stop destroying our planet, because it gives us life. We need to stop treating other human beings like they're not other human beings, because we're all one collective culture.\n\nCT: Everyone is so misinformed. Someone is saying that something is going to be good for you, or to people that are living in poverty, \"If we take away health care and cut teachers in classes and cut funding for social programs, that that's actually good for you and it's going to make your life better.\" People actually believe that. That not having an education doesn't matter.\n\nME: That to me seems, like Chris said, very \"doy.\" Let's be honest, if we were all created equal we need to all have the same opportunities. America is obviously an economic superpower, but if we don't make some serious changes we won't be. Part of it is that we don't seem to have any respect for jobs, we throw the American dollar around\u2026 I don't want to get into the whole thing about it. It's like Socialism, like that movie Bulworth, \"Socialism, say that dirty word\". If you look at the rest of the first world, like Japan and Europe, they're a socialist democracy, but they're capitalist. The only other thing I'll say is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is in our constitution. I believe that means no one should have to pay for healthcare. That's the most nickel and dimming business in the world, like, you pay if you get sick. Un-fucking-believeable, deplorable, that should be illegal. We have the knowledge and the ability and the power to heal people but, we don't if they don't have money? It's insane. Access to education, all people should have access to education. I'm not saying colleges shouldn't make money, but there should be a way that every person is able to get whatever information for free, period.\n\nCT: It's funny because it's one of the oldest of tricks in the book for anyone that wants keep power. For thousands of years, keep people stupid and you can do whatever you want. How are we still making that mistake?\n\nME: Fundamentalist Islam is the perfect example, the lack of education keeps these people angry and focused on violence.\n\nCT: Fighting each other, and not those that they're oppressed by.\n\nME: Exactly, fighting the other oppressed. And the pursuit of happiness along with life and liberty is, to me, no one should starve. If you live in a first world country, your government makes tons of money from taxes, and no one needs to starve. I think America does a pretty good job of that. I think it's all social.\n\nCT: I think the thing is that we obviously are politically minded, but we're not doing it to try to engage in an argument. The more you say this stuff, the more people come back and try to argue with you. We're not trying to force people to think our way.\n\nME: If anything, we just want people to think for themselves. Shit, don't agree with me. Go out and live your life, go and have adventures, go and meet people, go and see what you think is right.\n\nWith such consistent touring and so many other projects on you guys' plates, you have to be recording on the road. What recording equipment do you guys bring along on tour?\n\nCT: We can't bring a lot.\n\nME: I bring my ProTools rig, both of us bring keyboards, midi controllers.\n\nCT: Microphones.\n\nME: My iPhone has a bunch of recording programs on it for samples, I love field recordings.\n\nMatt, you've done colab work with both Zach Hill and Lisa Papineau. Can you talk a little about the process of working with these musicians?\n\nME: With Zach we just decided to jam for a few days. With Lisa, I flew out to France, and I recorded part of one song at her flat in Paris which is in the Bastille district which is beautiful. She lived above this sports bar when France was in the World Cup and they were playing Mexico. It was the most beautiful apartment. Then her friend's Uncle Raymond passed, we house sat the house, and were basically living in this 500-year old farm house in the middle of an old Roman village. It was in the middle of wheat fields, rapeseed, peas as far as the eye can see, like an ocean. Her friend, Matthieu, his grandfather was also named Raymond. In fact the living room where we listened to the dailies everyday, Raymond, who was a famous jazz musician played with Coltrane, Miles, all these cats, Dexter Gordon. They all jammed in that room. We recorded on Raymond's piano, so that's how the album came to be known as Chez Raymond. It's to commemorate his death, but also where we were at. It's amazing in a lot of the songs the ideas came from these dreams that I had. It was an old house, and in these dreams I felt like there was a ghost around, and they were just, it was strange. These sounds would just show up on tracks unexplained. I don't know how to explain it, but we used them, we used them in loops. I don't know if it was the spirit of Ray, but it was pretty cool. Then we finished out in East LA at her house. Even stranger, it's owned by a guy named Ray who she's good friends with. There were tons of dogs. There were like 5 dogs in her house in East LA. It was great.\n\nDo you think you'll work with her again?\n\nME: Yes\n\nYou guys have been with a couple labels. In this time of record labels collapsing and the industry having to completely reconfigure itself, how does Sargent House stack up?\n\nCT: It's working out with them. Sargent House is pretty DIY and Cathy, she does everything herself.\n\nME: She's really hands on. There are employees, Chase, Mark, and Brittany, they all do a really great job. Half of them toured with us, half of them cut their teeth by being on tour with us. Cathy is very passionate about music, and Sargent House has done a lot to help us in our career.\n\nCT: It is very personal. We were on another label at one point, and they were owned by MCA. So, there have been points where we were connected to labels and you meet random people. You don't really know anyone. There's no actual hands on\u2026\n\nME: They don't know anything about it, they don't know about music, and they don't care about it. There were so many people at Universal Music Group that didn't know anything about music. I don't think I met a single person who even knew how to play an instrument. It was like, why would I even want to associate with someone who didn't know even a little about rock music?\n\nCT: It's definitely nice in that regard. It's small and personal. Whatever we're doing we can always talk to Cathy or somebody else there. And they're all like friends.\n\nTim Stedman (former vice-president and creative director of MCA records) did the art direction for Progress. He took the \"forget this\" path, and stepped out of the record industry. How was he to work with as a large-label rep?\n\nME: He was actually one of the guys that I liked a lot. He was one of my favorite people there.\n\nCT: Those are the kind of people that end up changing the corporate labels.\n\nME: Or just end up going somewhere else.\n\nCT: If the record labels survive, it will be because people like that change"}
{"text":"Donate\n\nTo say that the Ripe is something of a supergroup in the Austin garage rock scene won't really mean anything to anyone who doesn't travel in those circles, but, for the record, frontguy Jake Garcia used to sling guitar for the Ugly Beats and bassist Gian Ortiz holds down the bottom in Amplified Heat. While the Ripe certainly lays 60s garage pop down as the foundation of its sound, Into Your Ear is no journey through Retroville. Garcia's jangling guitar and melodic whine would sound just as at home in mid-80s Great Britain as mid-60s Los Angeles, and his way with a melody gives \"Lost Weekend,\" \"Oubliette\" and \"Orchestra\" a soaring pop sound way beyond anything tied to a specific era. \"Neverending\" and \"The Greatest\" add some rock & roll muscle, while \"Constant Waves\" hits the acid blotter before plugging in. I'll admit to occasionally wishing Garcia had a little more testosterone in his voice, but given the strength of his melodies it's a minor complaint. It's a neat trick to affect both nostalgia and timelessness, but the Ripe pulls off the balance adroitly."}

{"text":"Having worked for a year as a tutor in a literacy center for immigrants, I realize there are certain universals that bring people together. One of them is music, and let me preface this review by saying I have no idea what these\nCzech-born rockers are saying, but I know exactly where they're coming from.\n\nThe opener, \"A.Letec\", reminds me immediately of Sonic Youth's touchstone\nDaydream Nation, in that its structures are buzzing and ghostly white. The discomfort of poverty in unclean streets braces against\ndirgy self-satisfaction and unsettling noise.\n\nThe title track is a bit less dissonant, but just as unnerving; pinning trip-hop scats to the swelling darkness. If in those early days of\nSonic Youth, they gave into every one of their gothic inclinations (and were multi-lingual, of course), it might sound a lot like Sona A Kuva. Overall, it is though the trio has grown up far too fast in neglected surroundings. The sense of spare hopelessness brings to mind a Dickensian workshop, wherein \"Snek\" shows they are yearning to break free, if they were not so overwhelmed by their own despair.\n\nDense rockers like \"Moje Ruce\" are parenthetically enjoyable, despite the wholly bleak nature of the album. Those emo kids may rise from the corners of suburbs to claim their depression, but it is a feeling of oppression encapsulated by their monotonous, dark sound that rolls deflated hearts into something substantial."}
{"text":"The Cokehead Hipsters release a cover album of classic rock songs. Wait. What?\n\nTheir first PV is for the Queen classic \"We Will Rock You.\" The sound is absolutely nothing like Queen. The band takes a Red Hot Chili Pepper's approach to the 1970\u2032s song and adds funk, psychedelic elements and crunchy guitars. The PV looks like a Dee-lite acid trip. It's quite amusing and something you will ultimately want to forget.\n\nRegardless, it's the unique way they handled the song that gets points in my book. I can only imagine how the rest of the album sounds: Coverhead Hipsters was released 2.23.2011 and includes 80\u2032s hits like My Sharona, Blue Monday, Walk Like an Egyptian, Funkytown and Come on Eileen. Score it at Yesasia."}
{"text":"Kangding Ray\n\nAutomne Fold\n\nI can't explain how we slept on this one, except that maybe its beauty is so unobtrusive I'd mistaken the semi-epiphanies it provoked for something outside of my headphones. Like Burial's Untrue (2007), Automne Fold's urban, nocturnal loneliness can sound morose or blas\u00e9 intially, until you wake up one day and realize the music has become like a second skin. Kangding Ray might also end up doing for minimal\/glitch techno what Burial did for dubstep: establishing warmth and intimacy in a genre not known for either.\n\nThe album might come across as a complete departure for Raster-Noton\u2014a label whose releases aren't all as austere and clinical as Ryoji Ikeda's Test Pattern, but who nevertheless have established themselves on the fringes of minimal techno. Still, when you take away the layers of warm distortion and (gasp!) vocals, all the elements that mark the label\u2014micro bits of static, CD skips, and other digital bi-products\u2014are still there. More song-oriented tracks like \"Idle\" and \"World Within Words\" might sound more suited to the more ambient-leaning side of Kompakt, but there's still something insular about them. The latter manages to build intensity by the even-metred bass which anchors the whispered speak-sing of the vocals, but the Oval-esque processed guitar backing turns the track into an investigation of space rather than the pop-linguistic philosophy that the lyrics seem to suggest.\n\nThese attempts at profundity do outweigh the music on \"Apn\u00e9e Part II,\" but it's all the rest of the tracks that use vocals as simply another sound in the mix that really stand out. On \"The Distance\" they're cut-up, flipped around, and subjected to glitchy intrusions, but they still sound remarkably organic. Like everything here, the deep bass hums that rattle your body don't get in the way of the details but merely provide smooth walls for the edgier sounds to brush up against. The title of this track is ironic; this music is right inside you."}
{"text":"'The Murder of Love,' the evolution of an indie band\n\nCD review\n\nWhere are all the musicians going nowadays? In the case of Dodd Ferrelle & The Tinfoil Stars, the band left Savannah and headed upstate to Athens. Why not, the college town is a great place for musicians, and has bequeathed such acts as R.E.M. and The B-52s. But does Dodd Ferrelle & The Tinfoil Stars have what it takes to make it big without changing its name to simple letter\/number combinations like its Athenian predecessors?\n\nThe group's latest album, \"The Murder of Love,\" is just rock without all the pretentiousness associated with other groups. The album also lacks the musical \"jamminess\" or \"boringness\" that other indie acts are producing.\n\nGuitar-driven tracks, with strong percussion, and an incredible cohesiveness make the instrumentation on \"Murder\" superb. The CD was produced meticulously, and sounds radio ready - if radio is ready for DF&TTS, that is.\n\nFerrelle apparently pulls on his country roots: The guitars twang rather than squeal, and a harmonica seals the deal to put the group in alt-rock-country territory. This is definitely a CD that requires domestic beer; imported beer would just feel wrong when paired with DF&TTS.\n\nNot to say the group is completely fabulous and ready for radio play. The group's namesake and lead singer sounds like Hootie (of Blowfish fame) if Hootie were on Vicodin. The lyrics are catchy and coherent, but the delivery makes you think he recorded the songs after a cavity filling. However, bassist Michelle McClure makes a brief lyrical stint on \"This Town,\" which is a breath of fresh air compared to the rest of the album.\n\nIn the end, \"The Murder of Love\" is a decent CD put out by a band that sounds much better live. Maybe The Tinfoil Stars should relegate Ferrelle to his guitar and let Michelle McClure be the voice of the band. If you get a chance to see them live, do it because they will be awesome, but split the price of the CD with someone else."}

{"text":"Hopewell\n\nFriday, June 5\n\nLike an artist dipping his brush into various colors and making delicate strokes with each, Hopwell leader and Mercury Rev alum Jason Russo is somehow able to draw from space rock, art rock, psychedelia, heavy rock, etc. without sounding quite like any of those things. At times, Russo weds melody with heaviness so seamlessly that one wonders why anyone ever bothered to make emo when they could have done something like this instead. Even if someone had, however, Russo's work would stand out. Like so many before him (and so many of his contemporaries today), Russo attempts to synthesize existing forms, but his subtle touch and distinct approach qualifies him as a true visionary. Hopewell albums are filled with nuance, and as such they reveal their treasures over time even as the reference points may be somewhat apparent right off the bat. Majestic harmonies, finely crafted production, and songs that swerve gracefully from style to style are just a few of the methods this band uses to guarantee satisfaction and freshness over repeated listens.

{"text":"Judgement Day, San Francesca, Cartoon Bar Fight, Hello The Future!\n\nDescription\n\nRemember when San Francesca were called Le Verita? They couldn't decide if they were a dance or rock band, just like early New Order. But their new album, We Live in Public, showcases their new lineup and matured sound. With a drummer, the synth-pop elements have been tempered significantly, exposing some of their less obvious influences like Sigur Ros and other slow burning, experimental post-rock bands, yet they still mix in some straight-forward pop sounds and some heart-felt indie rock influences (bands like the National come to mind). The first few tracks start out darker and heavier with Harrison Russell's vocals bathed in distortion, giving it an eerie distance. Deeper in, the album mellows out a bit. There's even a few pretty synth ballads, played with drums of course. Also performing is East Bay metal-string band Judgment Day. - Aaron Carnes sanjose.com"}
{"text":"(The Telescopes - Psych, Shoe-gazing, Space-rock, Noise-rock - just about covers all the bases)\n\nOne of the frustrating things about the Indie movement in the 90s was how quickly things were released and vanished. It was worse if you were a UK band and your discs were imported into the States. Unless you saw something and bought it right away, chances were you'd never see it again in your lifetime.\n\nThat was my experience with The Telescopes. Forming in the late 80s and disbanding, morphing, re-grouping, changing labels -it was hard, not only to pin them down style-wise, it was hard to pin down their releases. What little I heard of them I liked - they were, for me an extension of the Psychedelic stuff I'd been listening to since I was a teenager and they hit a distinctive chord with me from the get-go. The problem was, getting their stuff before they sold out.\n\nThroughout their careers they've released a lot of material on a lot of different labels. A very small percentage of it I managed to get.\n\nBut I did get an ep that has been a favorite ever since. \"Celeste\" came out in 1991 during their stay with Creation Records and the track \"All A Dreams\" (not a typo) was glued to my headphones for several years after first hearing it."}
{"text":"Say \"Hey There Stranger\" to Joy Lippard! | Posted October 13, 2009\nAlthough Joy isn't new to music, her face is new to the music world. After releasing two indie projects, and winning best pop song at GMA in the Rockies, Joy released her self-titled record in February 2009. Along with her unusual vocals and music, Joy is already making a name for herself after touring with Dove award winning artist Rush of Fools and newcomer Sarah Reeves. Joy's self-titled project deals with many emotions including relationships, self-image struggles, and love, just to name off a few. The album will definitely need a few listens, if you're like me, to actually like it.\n\nTHE ALBUM REVIEW\n\nThe album kicks off with \"Hey There Stranger\" an unusual song, along musical lines, that matches up with Joy's voice. While there is no real \"message\" in the song, she wrote it mainly about her first dating relationship, but she also says that in this song, \"I was trying to convey that in relationships, whether it is a dating relationship, or just a friendship, we need to go beyond that basic surface level.\"\n\nThe album continues with \"Miracle\" a song that began with her \"super big obsession\" of the TV show \"Prison Break.\" The entire song is about needing a miracle from God to free us from what's been holding us down. This is one of the more notable songs off the album. The down side of the song is that it begins with the overly used \"nah-nah-nah,\" and the chorus is also practically made up of the line \"you need a miracle.\" The song has a very weak ending with her aimless singing like what happens on \"She's a Diamond.\" While these aren't bad things, it just made the song much less appealing than it would have been if something else might have been done.\n\nJoy spoke in an interview about the song \"I Will Write You Letters\" saying that it was about her kind of missing writing letters in a world of e-mailing and texting, but the song really seems to be talking about her writing letters to someone she misses very much. Either way it's a good song, just need a bit more clarification on the song. =)\n\nSome of the self-image struggles she and her sister have gone through are also portrayed in the project with songs like \"She's a Diamond\" and \"Stronger.\" It's kind of sketchy to tell that either song is actually talking about self-image struggles unless you actually knew the background of the songs. It seems that \"She's a Diamond\" would be more along the lines of a guy waiting to marry a girl. It's a beautiful song; the only mess-up is what messes up the second track \"Miracle\": the instrumental part where she's just singing aimlessly. Also, the transition from the instrumental to the chorus again doesn't flow well. Musically speaking, \"Stronger\" is the heaviest song off the album; however, the song does not match well with her voice. If this song was listened to by a person who wasn't familiar with Joy's music they would think that this track would be talking about a person who tried to have a relationship with her but it failed because of what she saw what the person was really like. Although the song ends with her saying \"God help me break away,\" it then could be interpreted a sin held her life.\n\n\"Hole in My Pocket\" is, in my opinion, the most notable track off the record. Although the song kicks off with a weak start, the song gets stronger musically. The lyrics are what really stand out though. The entire song concept is not new, but the way it's conveyed really hits home. The entire song is letting go of what we've held onto, every bit of it, it's not our own; it's God's. So even though we're \"left here empty handed\" all we \"ever needed was in You.\"\n\nThe least notable tracks are \"It's Your Life,\" \"Too Much to Ask For,\" and \"The Other Side.\" Musically speaking these tracks are good, but unfortunately her voice downplays the songs very much because her voice stands out above the music. The voice should of course is what stands out, and the music should be a support. However, the music you have to look beyond her voice and really focus on the beauty of the music. The lyrics of one of the songs has a message, but it just loses it in not portraying who she found trust in.\n\nThe song ends with a song that serves well as an album ending track. The song name is \"Walk Me Home.\" The beat is catchy and so are the lyrics. The song describes walking with Jesus in His mercy and grace.\n\nWhile not the strongest project I've heard, the lyrics stand out from many experienced artists clich\u00e9s. The music also is a stand out because it's not your everyday style that you hear. Miss Lippard's definitely got a good start and a lot going for her, but it all might need just a little bit more polishing."}
{"text":"Dusted Features\n\nLife In Mono\n\nJapan's Mono are a rock quartet, but their take on rock grows from the drama, from the epic journeys of sound that music can trigger in the listener. Without a vocalist, their communication comes straight from the heart, through the instruments, and into the audience. Natural points of reference include Mogwai, SubArachnoid Space, Tarentel, and even Sigur Ros at points, but their feeling for emotional journeys through sound is very much their own.\n\nGuitarist Taka is the group's leader. The others number three: second guitarist Yoda, bassist Tamaki, and drummer Takada. I spoke to Taka before a show at San Francisco's Bottom of the Hill, where they flattened the audience with high peaks and low valleys of emotion. The waves of sound clearly demonstrated that this band have mastered dynamics at an instinctive level; best of all, the playing felt organic, and not overly calculated.\n\nMany thanks to Izumi Evers for translation assistance.\n\nDusted: How did you all meet?\n\nTaka: Around '97-'98, a certain genre of music was popular in Japan: electronica, big beat, abstract hip-hop. I could make music using sampling, but originally I'm a guitarist, so I naturally felt that I wanted to do something focusing on the guitar sound. At the time, with one of the bands I used to be in, it felt like something new was about to happen, but it wasn't clear. My feeling was that I wanted to do something new with guitar, and at the end of the '90s I was wondering. That was the time when My Bloody Valentine, Nirvana, all that music with guitar had already been exported, so it seemed like there was no way to create a new kind of music using guitar.\n\nSo that was the atmosphere of the Japanese music industry at the end of the '90s. It was 1999 when I met the drummer, Takada, and at that time I was using the computer to try to create a new style of music. That's when we established the basis of what we're doing now. But most of the places to play in Japan didn't know how to handle our kind of music, so we didn't play live. And because we were using computer sounds, the atmosphere, and the essence of human emotion sounded like it had been removed. So then I searched hard for some other members. It only took about a month, and then we were the band that we are right now.\n\nD: So was the change away from using computers because of a combination of the clubs not being prepared, and that it wasn't the sound you wanted?\n\nT: The computer used a click track to control the timing of the playing of the music. As the leader of the band I actually controlled and composed the music, but on the other hand the computer does the job too exactly. So to me it sometimes was just boring.\n\nD: How are the songs created now? What's the process?\n\nT: Before, I basically wrote the notes... There's a reason why I have to make this music. The fundamental reason, or the cause of creating the music, starts from my gut, from something within myself that I want to explore. That's the beginning, the basic cause...\n\nD: Do you write all of the songs fully composed?\n\nT: Well, when I explained about writing the music, I didn't mean that I actually write a script for the music. I use the computer as a tool, but that doesn't mean I'm depending on the computer. I'm the kind of guy who cannot go to sleep peacefully without creating something. So to prevent myself from not being able to create, I force myself to be exposed to external things, like movies and so on. I sort of force myself to become creative. I won't literally write songs down on a piece of paper, but I put pieces of creations into the computer.\n\nD: You record pieces into the computer so you won't forget them?\n\nT: Yes, I wouldn't be able to repeat that state of mind for the music, so I do that.\n\nD: Do all of the songs come from you?\n\nT: First I come up with the original sound, and then I introduce it to the other members, share it with them first. If that piece of sound doesn't click with any of the other members, that means that my creation won't be able to communicate with other people, so we won't use it. But if that music somehow stimulates the other members' brains and creativity, somehow we all unite together and start creating, and then we establish a song. So that's the process.\n\nAlso, we're touring right now, and every time we tour we present music. If that music fails to reach the audience's heart then it's not creative, and that's not what I want to do. Every day I feel like I'm creating music by touring.\n\nWe're not making music only to impress people, like in one direction. What we're doing is... If the music won't reach the closest people, the band's members, then that music won't connect to other people either. Music that will connect is what I'm pursuing, not like other musicians who are just doing it to show off.\n\nD: How do you feel about communicating with music that doesn't have words?\n\nT: Words are there for us to live, or to live together. I don't want to say that all words are just communication, but there is a lot of lying within words. You can lie...words don't contain 100% truth. But sound is at a more deeply subconscious level that directly reaches to the other person's subconscious level. I feel that I'm able right now to perform this music, it's coming from my truth, and that will enable the audience to sense it. That's the communication that I'm doing.\n\nD: Are there other bands that do actually lie with their music? Sometimes you can tell that they don't really feel what they're playing.\n\nT: (laughs) Mostly! I feel mostly that with other bands, the words are lying, but I can totally sympathize with the sounds. I can imagine an atmosphere, why I want to create the music, what kind of motivation I had to come up with the music. That must be a very very private part of oneself, but even though that's very private, it's really related to the music, and everybody is sharing that.\n\nD: Is it more difficult to lie with instrumental music?\n\nT: No, it's easy. It's possible, maybe it's easy too. Even back in the time of Beethoven, those people are artists, they're very poor, and in order to live, they created those pieces of art to please the royal families. So there's the idea of capitalism, creating music as business, established even back then. Especially right now, the music industry is nothing but business. Everybody has the intention to create some music to please the market. But I really think that music is supposed to be more beautiful, and I'd like to express that truth.\n\nD: Have you ever made some music that you felt very strongly about, but that you decided would not be understood by the audience?\n\nT: Fortunately I've never had that happen. Three years ago when I first started playing outside Japan, I was curious if maybe because of the cultural differences, people might interpret it differently. But I never really felt that way, so that's good.\n\nD: I wondered about that, if the audience reacts differently in the U.S. and in Japan.\n\nT: How they listen is different. Over here they're wild. In Japan it's very subtle, because maybe Japanese people aren't able to really express how they're feeling. But then when I'm watching, I really feel something, and I sometimes see that the audience are receiving, but they don't express it.\n\nD: I've noticed that also. Audiences in Japan will sit and watch very closely, but there's no reaction until maybe afterwards.\n\nT: Yes. Today is the time of the Internet, and right after the shows I receive an amazing amount of response by email, so then I try to respond back. Without that kid of response people seem kind of dead, and I just wouldn't know. Sometimes I've wondered, did I make a mistake? (laughs)\n\nD: Since the songs are instrumental, the titles of the songs and albums become very important, because it's what people will first see to get an idea about the song. How do you think about that?\n\nT: Actually I suppose the opposite. I don't really pay too much attention to the titles. Usually I don't even title the songs -- other people make the titles. I understand that they could be a hook for the reader to listen to the music, so they will provide the door to enter the world of the music. But if it's something I wanted to explain in words, I wouldn't make it into music anyway. So it's the same as lyrics: to me, I'm just making something that's undescribable, therefore I'm making music. So the titles are just not a main concern.\n\nQ: I wondered about titles like \"Mopish Morning, Halation Wiper\" -- does it have any meaning?\n\nT: What I can remember is that one or two years ago when we were touring, we played in Washington DC. Because our music was too loud, we were kicked out. I was so pissed that I turned up full volume and wrecked the equipment. Then on the way back, in the car, there was a long tunnel, very dark. It was raining. We drove through the tunnel and then we saw the shining sky. One of the others said that the music was something like that, and that's how we made the title. To me, the song is pretty dark, but it also has the potential to continue and move on, so it's not really all dark.\n\nD: I have to ask about the album title, One Step More and You Die -- it's very dark.\n\nT: I think the music industry in Japan is very closed, compared to the musicians from US or Europe, because the market is small in Japan. So we have to work outside our area, into the U.S. and Europe, although I could make a living just focusing on performing in Japan, because there is a market. Outside Japan, I didn't personally know other bands, and I didn't even know how to approach outside Japan's market, so I struggled to find a deal. So there was a time, still today really, when every time I would step forward, there was some kind of force against me. So there's always the struggle to expand my music into the worldwide market. There's some kind of a feeling there that's in the title. At the time when I made that title, it was the worst moment of struggling. The next album could be more positive.\n\nD: The first album here was from the Tzadik label -- how did you meet them, through John Zorn? And then how did you find Arena Rock?\n\nT: I wanted to perform in New York because I felt that New York was more suitable to the music than Tokyo. So I searched, and found that label, and I sent some things to introduce myself to John Zorn, and that's how we made the connection. Right after we made the Tzadik album, I was looking for other labels in the U.S. to do more. I didn't really like the underground scene or the indie scene, but we weren't really hardcore either. Arena Rock seemed to be very suitable for the direction that we want to go, so I sent something to them.\n\nQ: Is there a scene in Japan for Mono now?\n\nT: Compared to 3 years ago, the audience is definitely more established in Japan. And also I set up a label by myself to release the music, like our first 4-track EP. I've also established an import label, because the music industry is, like I said, very closed. There are labels like Sub Pop, Matador -- they're there, but it's really hard for Japanese audiences to encounter that kind of music unless the music magazine does reviews and talks about it. Then finally the audience will recognize them. I'm the kind of guy who researches to discover music from another country. I wanted to introduce the music in Japan, so I established my own label. It covers from Okinawa all the way to Hokkaido, all over Japan, so I've put myself in a responsible position. Now I can coordinate a tour if they want to do one, because those people of course want to tour in Japan. But before, they didn't know how to do it. Like for me, if I wanted to tour in the U.S., through knowing bands from outside of Japan who share the same struggle, we can cooperate. So I can do what I want to do outside Japan, and they can do what they want to do in Japan. It's very fair.\n\nD: What's the name of the label?\n\nT: Human Highway Records. My dream is not anything special. I'm Japanese, so of course I want to perform in Japan. But there are many bands who, because they're not popular in Japan, they just go overseas. Then when they become well-known outside Japan, they tend to stay outside Japan. On the other hand, if the band is already popular and well-established in Japan, they always want to remain in Japan, they don't want to get out. What I want to do is simply to perform, nothing special.\n\nI hate the major labels because they just care about success. If the band doesn't do well, they don't care, they'll just get rid of the band. If the band does well, okay, they'll extend the contract to 2 years, and they expect the band to make more money. This kind of major label behavior gives me a big motivation to show them that I can do it without the money. If I can perform in Japan as well as in the U.S. and other countries, to the same kind of audience, I might be able to get their attention and show them that it can be done."}

And it's called bells.\n\nArtrockers,\nBack in 1990 Orbital's single Chime did an amazing thing, it charted.

I knew what I wanted when I wrote the song and that was it. I guess I have to write that song a few more times and then people will really start to care about us.\"\n\nRuess is also glad the second single is doing so well and that people are getting into the sound and vibe of Fun..\n\n\"I'm a competitive person and I always want to do better than anyone else or better even than myself, but I'm thankful,\" he says.\n\n\"I've been doing this pretty much for 10 years and if this is as big as it's going to get then I'll take it, but I would like to think that there's still a lot more up my sleeve.\"\n\nHowever, the 30 year-old frontman isn't letting their newfound success go straight to his head.\n\n\"To me, it's about playing a show and having a tonne of people there and having them sing every single word. That's the stuff that means the most to me,\" he adds.\n\n\"I hope that everybody appreciates the songs but moreso I hope they purchase the album and understand what we're all about or what my lyrics are about.\""}

{"text":"Meet Roysta: Dirtcore's Poster Boy\n\nImagine a punk rapping over beats ranging from hip-hop to ska to gabba techno. Now imagine subject matter that ranges from the joys of chain smoking to venereal disease to pimping out teenagers. OK, now add a thick Belfast accent and you've got the vaguest of ideas about what my buddy Lee James, or rather his alter ego Roysta, is all about.\n\nHis lyrics are simultaneously repulsive and hilarious, while his music artfully straddles \"extremely difficult to listen to\" and \"insanely catchy\". It's pointless for me to even try to describe his sound, just pause whatever shitty bro-step you're listening to and go here to be enlightened. This isn't just Motely Crue singing about coke and hookers though, this is an alcoholic rapping about going on four-day Bucky and mephedrone binges in Belfast shitholes. Really.\n\nSo I wanted to find out how much of Roysta was a character and what effect he'd had on Lee James's brain and body wellbeing\n\nNoisey: Hey! So...describe your music\n\nRoysta: Yeah it's punk hip-Hop with influences of electro, hardcore, gabba and everything else I like about music. I use the hip-hop aspect to get across what I want to say rather than scream it down a microphone, I rap. But all the topics for songs come from the punk side of things. It used to be all straight up hip-hop beats, but I got sick of doing gigs where people were just standing there nodding their heads. I like things a little more chaotic so I wanted to get people dancing.\n\nI've been to your gigs\u2026 I'd say you've definitely succeeded.\n\nThey're too chaotic now, everyone's jumping up on the stage and shit.\n\nDo you have rituals before you go on stage? How do you prepare?\n\nI'm usually out in the crowd drinking. When I'm doing a gig half the time I don't even know if there is a backstage. I used to drink a bottle of Bucky before going on, but I couldn't do that now. I've also given up fucking smoking so I can't even do that...\n\nYou've given up smoking?!\n\nYeah, fucking right. I did this video, \"Walking Heart Attack\". It's all about how much I love smoking and how I'm never going to stop, but now I'm wheezing and coughing like I need to be in an iron lung.\n\nI saw the video; it's pretty pro smoking.\n\nI fucking never wanted to smoke after that video again. I have the odd one but that video put me off them forever. They weren't even proper cigs; they were from abroad so they had fucking wood and shit in them. I had to walk around in my pants constantly smoking. Now I need an inhaler.\n\nA lot of your songs revolve around drink and drugs, specifically how they've ruined your life. Have you ever considered going clean?\n\nHa, fuck, as the older I get I'm definitely not drinking as much, but there's been a few periods of my life where I've been a functioning alcoholic. But I wrote my best lyrics in those times though so I'm not complaining. I've got a real love hate thing with drinking. It's such a part of the Roysta character, I can't get away from it.\n\nSo how much of Roysta is a character?\n\nI'd say about 80% is a character; just small bits of my personality creep in. I'm always quite worried when people meet me and they're shocked that I'm not like Roysta. I'm saying, \"well, you can't actually think I'm fucking like him; I'd be in prison for fuck sake.\"\n\nSo is it fair to say that the character of Roysta hates everything?\n\nHe's soaked in nihilism. He's offensive for the sake of being offensive. It doesn't really work anymore though. Everyone just thinks it's funny now.\n\nSo you actively set out to be offensive?\n\nYes. When I first started recording I just wanted to be pissing people off. At the very start it was really fucking pornographic as well. It used to be I'd make music for certain pockets of people who I knew would like it, and pockets of people who I knew would be offended by it. But I don't really do that anymore, now I'm just making music that I want to hear.\n\nAre there any topics you won't touch?\n\nI've actively cut out all the misogynistic shit, I didn't want people to think I actually hated women. I used to do really homophobic stuff as well, but then I realized I was a faggot so I can't do that anymore either hahaha!\n\nSo you've been doing the character of Roysta for nearly ten years, what's the worst thing to come out of \"being Roysta\"?\n\nThe worst thing is definitely my health. I've got asthma from smoking too much, stomach ulcer, gallstones and a fucking air bubble in my brain at one point.\n\nAn air bubble?!\n\nYeah, I'd been partying, doing loads of coke and stuff, then the next few days I couldn't sleep and my eyes were fixed. When I turned my head, my eyes would stay in the same place. So I had to go for a CAT-scan and they found a bubble. But it hasn't left me with any side effects really, my brains all right\u2026 at least I hope it is.\n\nShit. You actually quit Roysta for a while back in 2006, was that motivated by health concerns?\n\nI was trying to rein in the partying and all that in so I gave up Roysta. I ended up going to Glasgow for a gig as a favor to a friend. We all ended up taking acid and Es and running around naked with some girls, climbing over cars and pulling wipers off like fucking feral monkeys. It was a three-day cocktail of drugs and nakedness, something changed in me.\n\nAnd this inspired you to turn back to Roysta?\n\nIt wasn't so much it inspired me, it was more , I thought \"this needs documented\", there was enough material for the whole of the next Roysta album.\n\nIt's clear that a lot of your lyrics are inspired by your lifestyle. Like, your song \"Eat The Evidence\" was about mephedrone right?\n\nThat song dated faster than the drug. As soon as I released it, everyone realized how shit it was and stopped doing it. It's essentially become a historical comment on a drug.\n\nHa. OK, what's your favorite drug?\n\nLate 90s Es, back when you could take one and you'd be set for the night and you loved everyone.\n\nAnd the worst?\n\nHeroin. It was fucking horrible. I only did it the once. I was in Glasgow and I thought to myself \"when in Rome.\"\n\nSo what do you do when you're not making music or partying. Is it true you only watch Colombo?\n\nI don't have a TV anymore but when I did I fucking loved Colombo! Bargain Hunt too, Tim Wonnacaught is fucking legend."}
{"text":"Of all the words I tend to overuse hideously when writing about music - and I'm hankering after the now-blacklisted 'sophomore' here - 'pop' is the one I'd swear by the most. More so than 'indie', whose rep has taken a bit of a battering of late, 'pop' is the bandwagon whose wheels I'm happiest throwing myself under time and again. Rather than get bogged down too much into a discussion about semantics (pop-ular? pop-ulist? Etc), let's instead look at pop in all its vague and polymorphous glory. (As an aside, one colleague's best stab at defining the word neatly was 'anything you dance to at a family wedding', to which the obvious riposte is I would dance to Joy Division records at a family wedding, and do it with a shit-eating grin on my face that scares the crap out of the kids.)\n\nFor music critics, pop seems more of an ill-defined sensibility than anything, a platonic ideal that has no meaning outside of their own twisted logic. Animal Collective? Pop, innit. Deerhoof? Fahckin' blinding tunes, geezer. Of course, critics are also by and large overgrown mummies' boys that never quite recovered from their adolescences and therefore aren't best equipped to understand when the public at large chooses not to see things their way. Take M.I.A., for instance. Capable of transforming even the most dour of post-rock worshipping musos into rabid, delirious disciples of POP, she is nonetheless incapable of persuading the great unwashed of her universal appeal \u2013 27,000 sales of Arular to date and a little over 2,000 of Kala midway through its first week of release. At the other end of the spectrum to M.I.A's consummate sense of 'now-ness', there's the whole raft of Brian Wilson-aping indie-poppers, regularly written about in hallowed terms as 'perfect pop' but again selling generally bugger all records - The Shins may be a big deal in America but they've barely made a dint in the national consciousness over here, of Montreal have only recently transcended toilet venue status ten years into their careers, and New Pornographers have yet to make a splash four albums in.\n\nDeerhoof 'The Perfect Me': pop, allegedly\n\nAt worst, a literate approach to pop music amounts to the kind of convoluted snobbery that's very much the preserve of indie fandom, but it's also resulted in some of the best groups of the past few decades, and ones that actually sold a few records, too \u2013 from the brainy end of glam (Bowie, Roxy Music) through to the entryist approach of the early new romantic bands (Scritti Politti, Heaven 17) and new pop vanguardists like Orange Juice, Associates et al.\n\nArguably, though, pop doesn't need indie lending its music a veneer of credibility right now. As the chart-bothering indie music du jour scrabbles for the centre ground with the unprincipled indignity of a New Labour rally in the home counties, ripe with poorly-observed platitudes or solipsistic epic-isms and riddled with presumptions about the primacy of guitar music over subnormal pop, cred-pop continues to deliver tunes by the spadeful with none of the pomposity \u2013 Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen, Rihanna, Sugababes, Girls Aloud, Timbaland (okay, maybe he's a bit pompous). To put it another way, would you rather hear Timbaland's crisp, sexy production on Nelly Furtado's 'Say It Right', or would you prefer to hear Kele Okereke bleat his way earnestly through the track for Jo Whiley's Live Lounge?\n\nShould this be allowed to happen, ever?\n\nTravis 'Hit Me Baby One More Time'\n\nWe're used to hearing bands drone on about the perils of being pigeonholed, but where it's accurate at least, no band worth their salt would get haughty about being tagged 'pop'; pop being spritely, irreverent, aware where rock is merely leaden and self-important.\n\nWhich brings us, albeit in a very roundabout fashion, to the big question: what are the arty pop acts you'd like to see \/ have seen selling records by the bucketload? Does pop even need art meddling in its affairs?\n\nYou should:\n\nComments\n\ndidn't really go anywhere, did it?\n'pop', like all genre terms, is only useful for a point to describe music, like 'indie', 'rock', etc. maybe we should leave arguments over semantics and definitions to the dictionary folks?\n\nwith this piece is that it starts by saying \"pop music is great, it shouldn't be frowned upon for being popular etc etc\" and then, at the end, asks for which \"arty pop acts\" you'd like to see. Why do they have to be arty? Why can't they just be pop?\n\non dEUS' first album that said something like \"pretentious art wank?...as a big fan of both art and wanking...\" and it was a recommendation. dEUS never sold any records and probably aren't pop. now, is my comment as well made as the article that preceded it or what?!\n\neverything's so intertwined and blurred, especially now, that there isn't really anything worth going over anymore in discussions like this. as the article hints at, \"pop\" is mostly a structural description, just like \"post-rock\" or \"post-hardcore\" or \"slowcore\" or whatever the fuck is. thats all there is to it, and there isnt much to say about it either. its meaningless\n\nas an aside, i'm confused as to why post rock, a genre which is generally fairly simple, not very diverse and a bit self-parodical has (in the uk) come to represent the pedestal of high art for indie dorks? especially as in america it's very frequently treated with skepticism and often ridicule\n\nYanks can't even spell Scepticism correctly, so what do they know?! More generally, i don't think American cultural mores are going to serve as a weapon to lambast British culture (especially as you have to reduce us to crude, clumsy, irrelevant stereotypes to do it) when it's international cultural reputation (however fair) is a by-word for superficiality, lazy derivation, and a low opinion of the audience.\n\nIn all honesty, the indie dorks i know don't worship at the altar of any one genre and might look down on Sigur Ros whilst praising the latest EITS effort. The music they're most likely to jump about celebrating would be Green Acre types bunging as many notes, time signatures and patterns into one song as possible.\n\nIsn't art when people take a cultural form (music, painting, writing, ship-building etc.) and try to give it a deeper meaning than the purely functional (you can sing along, dance to it, it's pretty\/colourful, it describes something, it floats...).\n\nSo pop isn't necessarily art, any more than any other musical genre, but it can be - it all depends upon the intentions and skill of the maker."}
{"text":"Jay Reatard\n\nWatch Me Fall (Matador Records)\n\nEarly word on Watch Me Fall, the first proper full-length from Jay Reatard since signing to Matador Records, is that it's the most mature work he's ever done, that it signals a massive change in his approach \u2014 from the youthful lo-fi punk of his early singles to a batch of songs that would have been at home on Rubber Soul. This is something of an exaggeration, of course. Jay Reatard has come to be known for an aggression that's only occasionally shone through on record. His reputation has been earned more from his ear-splitting live shows, where songs are sped up until they're barely recognizable. In reality, it would be doing his back catalogue a disservice to act as if it's all just noisy, three-chord punk; he's always had a deep respect for melody, and there was a musical playfulness always lurking just beneath the surface.\n\nThat said, it's true that Watch Me Fall is the first Jay Reatard album where that playfulness takes center stage. As for how it happens, or why, it certainly has something to do with how it was recorded. One imagines he was working with a larger recording budget than he'd grown accustomed to, and it's a veritable master's course in how to improve fidelity without pissing off the people who liked you before you had access to decent studio.\n\nMost songs clock in under three minutes, but they contain more parts than his older stuff, which could explain the accusations of maturity being thrown his way. This is also probably why Watch Me Fall is Jay Reatard's finest moment: he's always had problems incorporating more than a single thought into a song, which he would then harp on for a tiny bit too long. Jumping around a bit more is serving him quite well.\n\nWhat he's managed to maintain on Watch Me Fall, and what's most impressive considering his recent success, is the self-doubt he's been singing about for so long. He makes paranoia, disillusionment and loneliness sound inspiring rather than crippling. It's not difficult to imagine a packed crowd at Webster Hall singing along to the last lines of the opening track: \"All is lost, you can't go home\/All is lost, there is no hope for me.\" One must be either very childish or very mature to recognize the beauty in singing those words along with a group of people. It's not important which side Jay Reatard is on, as long as he's not stuck in the middle. Which he isn't."}
{"text":"the eponymous EP and follow-up 7\" 'Get Sick'\/'We Tried', the revived Bouts sound has been incredibly succinct, all hooky basslines, grungy guitars and skyscraping vocals.\n\n\"We didn't really know what our sound was going to be,\" Bracken observes, \"and it surprised us. Suddenly when we heard 'We Tried', Shane (Cullen, producer extraordinaire) played it back to us in the studio and we were going, 'What the hell? Is this our sound?' We suddenly realised, 'This is our sound!' It was the first time we'd actually heard it properly and it was very odd.\"\n\nSound firmly in place, the lads set about filming the video for 'Turn Away', a kind of platonic love-in with a karaoke twist.\n\nBracken remembers, \"We rounded up lots of friends and piled into a karaoke booth at midnight. I'd love to say that it was storyboarded and that we'd planned the whole thing, but we winged it and were just lucky enough that we had enough good footage to stick together. That was a lot of fun.\"\n\nThe video was inspired by a rehearsal when Bracken lost his voice, a common occurrence I'm guessing, with a roof-raising yelp like his.\n\n\"I don't take singing lessons,\" he admits. \"Perhaps I should. I wouldn't be the world's greatest or most natural singer but I'm at a point now when I'm not shit and it's working better for me. There are times when I think the band is really bad for me because I can't sing what I'm supposed to sing, so there's a lot of delicate behaviour with lemon and honey.\"\n\n\"Barry's other approach is to stay out drinking 'til five in the morning the day before a gig,\" Flynn reveals, \"and then go, 'Jeez, that sounds pretty good for a lad who's been drinking whiskey all night!'\"\n\nSounds like Bouts have almost got everything under control, but will we be seeing the sort-of-debut-sort-of-follow-up album any time soon? new"}
{"text":"Question of the Day\n\nAP: Popular music has taken on an electronic, dance sound recently. Why do you think that's happened?\n\nAlbarn: It's cyclical, you know. It will take a guitar sound probably next spring. And you won't be arrested if you're playing keyboards and you've got an '80s haircut. I'm really hoping that the next revival is the kind of Brit-pop revival (laughs). No, I'm joking.\n\nAP: What inspires the music you create?\n\nAlbarn: It's everything. It's kind of an ongoing search for inspiration. A few days ago I was inspired by a revolving door in a hotel. I was.\n\nAP: So it's the little things?\n\nAlbarn: Definitely little things. It's when a little thing touches you emotionally that (snap hands), that little glimpse, that little insight into what all the (expletive) all this is about. Those are the moments I find most exciting. Huge, great, big themes are very difficult to encapsulate in pop music."}
{"text":"About this album\n\nTwo Way Monologue is the sophomore LP from Norwegian indie-rocker Sondre Lerche. Barely old enough to drink, it's strange to notice every song sounds like he plucked it straight from the past. From one of those old movies or the carefree times they were made in.\nAlthough each song is primarily an acoustic, solo showcase of Sondre's strumming and lilting vocals, ala Jeff Buckley, or even Louis Armstrong (particularly on \"Wet Ground\"), there's still a lot more going on. Sounds ranging from strings, keys, and backing vocals to electronic bloops that sound like alien ships on twilight zone or the bridge of old star trek episodes, prove that he's doing something different. Strangely, it still seems there's not much to it. The old lounge sound feels slightly repetitive and monotone, leaving you asking, why not listen to the old favorites?"}
{"text":"After Dark\n\nAFTER DARK\n\nTHE COATHANGERS WITH BLONDIE OF THE CLERMONT LOUNGE: Critics' Pick for Best New Music Act and Readers' Pick for Best Stripper, respectively\n\nSome things become pass\u00e9 with the passage of time. Like spandex biker shorts. Remember when those were hot? Other stuff transcends the era in which it was created. Sorta like oatmeal. It's always on the menu.\n\nSure, it's easy to take a young, all-female band such as the Coathangers, mash them up with the city's oldest beer-can-crushing stripper, and label the former trendy and the latter timeless. But that barely scratches the surface. Because there's nothing more timeless than watching a band full of cute twentysomethings provoke extreme reactions by throwing their femininity in everybody's face. On the other hand, if you've never had Blondie jab you in the face with her tits at the Clermont Lounge, you have yet to receive a true gag gift.\n\nLikewise, Atlanta's emerging rock scene is brand-spanking new compared with the city's entrenched rap industry. Yet bands such as the Black Lips and Deerhunter put Atlanta on blast in '07 with timeless techniques like DIY touring, grassroots promotion and buzz-worthy performances. Meanwhile, homegrown hip-hop relied on the viral marketing of YouTube dance-offs, mixtape massacres, and a fleeting fantasy to \"Party Like a Rockstar.\"\n\nJust like the city, the vibe Atlanta emits is a little bit country and a little bit controversial. Put the two together and you get something greater than the sum of our parts."}
{"text":"Daytrotter Studio (Rock Island, IL)\n\nDec 1, 2011\n\nThere's always that attraction going round. There's never any end to it, hence there's never any end to what becomes of it. When attraction is partially due to other needs that have little to do with it - loneliness and boredom - those are the skid marks that you see crookedly swerving into the ditch, turning the guardrail into a twisted snarl, or leading to sad, lonely fire where everyone's just moving around and rubbing their hands together. It's this kind of attraction that is also wildly rampant. It's what leads to poor decisions and usually isn't lamented all that much. It just is. It leads people into the arms that they find to be the closest, not the safest or most loving. If it's just for a night or two, the long-term effects are minimal and there can be an abundance of stories to be had. One is able to draw out of every situation a lesson that can seem larger than it should be. The clarity can smack with a bark and an immediate, red welt.\n\nNashville singer and songwriter Caitlin Rose lets herself feel the things that get her caught in all kinds of traps, slings and sticky webs. She knows she's doing it and doesn't even dislike that it happens - smacking her mouth to the bitter taste left over on the other side of it. When you're courting heartbreak and actually, sorta need it to feel alive, you're not going to avoid it all that actively. You might not run out to find it, but you'll give it a big bear hug and a kiss on the lips when you do. Rose needs these ill-advised, chance encounters and these failed loves to feed her need to write about such things. They've got to come from somewhere and better to feel them herself than to have them shown or recited secondhand. It's the country way to do it yourself, to get your hands dirtied in the thickets of bad decisions and silly men. The way a shitty relationship behaves and detonates is always a thousand times better to hear about than one that's going well and has the icing still on the cake, replenished with every feeding. Rose sings enthusiastically about the thrills and chills that come with seeking out the companionship of a boy toy on the old Coasters song \"Youngblood,\" maybe because she identifies with feeling like she'll always be wearing the pants. She will be able to say where, when and how and determine its longevity, not the other way around. The pressure is diminished, but then again, there's no reason to believe that she doesn't thoroughly enjoy being completely out of control either.\n\nShe's best here, and elsewhere, when she is. When's she's the one taking the knocks and getting hurt, she's a brilliant chronicler of it all. She makes it sound as if it's all gonna be okay. She'll think about it all, mull on it, spin it into a chorus and a handful of classic and catchy Nashvillian verses and then she'll smoke a cigarette or two and catch a Budweiser. She'll set herself up for a do-over - for the rewind and the reenactment. She'll sing, \"And fall back into my absent arms\/Fall back into routine disaster\/Habit's the only place that you call home\/Fall back into my desperate arms\/Fall back into this old disaster\/Cause it's better than spending all your nights alone,\" as she does on \"For The Rabbits,\" and then alter the sentiment a little to stick up for it, singing, \"Looking back at myself\/It's wrong how much I changed for you.\" It's always a little of both - the shame and reality."}

{"text":"Track List\n\nMore About This CD\n\nA truly synergistic effort...a natural blending of elements that\n\ngo perfectly together. It links future and past, cutting-edge electronics and the original instrument, the human voice, into a singular musical message. Light tribal percussion and bell-like sounds mix with wordless humming drones on the title track.\n\nElectronics sweep in over the top as a reminder that this is a product of modern day civilization instead of some primitive artifact. The breathy vocals near the end are haunting, but also soothing. This is a rich, palpable listening experience, and it's only the beginning.\n\nWind chimes and thunder begin 'Offering,' followed by echoing drips of water. Sparse at first, then long slow washes of electronics impart a relaxed, flowing quality. The entire CD is extremely laid back and contemplative, but not minimalist or mundane. The music grows and changes organically, sometimes dramatically as with 'Satari,' which bristles with restrained intensity and power.\n\nExpecting it to crescendo, it instead levels off, allowing a stage for Jim's harmonic singing. Rapidly swirling synths circle in the background, followed unexpectedly by a sequence that is more Berlin school than ambient.\n\nIt's a unique blending of genres, but they pull it off. Moving back to more drone-oriented, meditative fare, 'Theidea' is brief, bright shimmers of sound and voice. Jim demonstrates his remarkable range on 'Sanguine Moon.' I would swear that a female voice lends the wailing sound to this, but it credits Jim singing falsetto, no other vocalists. Amazing.\n\nGreg's gamelan sounds add loads of atmosphere, as layer upon layer is added. This really sounds like his work under the Open Canvas moniker, without the dance influence. Similar in tone is 'Waking the Divine,' again very tribal and other worldly, but with a slower, more deliberate pace. The Japanese-influenced 'Samui' brings Bislama to a long, slow, blissful close."}
{"text":"Tuesday, February 24, 2009\n\nMusic news\nLive review: Balkans 7-inch release party at Vacation Boutique\n\nBalkans played a 7-inch release party on Sunday night (Feb. 22) at Vacation Gallery & Boutique in the Virginia Highlands, and there was one small problem: there weren't any 7-inches to be found. The label didn't get them from the pressing plant in time for the show, which has been an increasingly common problem as of late. Rumor has it that all of the pressing plants around the country are experiencing a huge demand for vinyl right now. As a result it's taking longer and longer to get records.\n\nThe group played anyway, and they wore an awful lot of denim when they did (see above). There were about 25 people in attendance for the 20+ minute set. Balkans craft a jittery and fast-paced punk\/surf\/fuzzed-out pop grind that teems with energy while they perform.\n\nGuitarist\/bass player Brett Miller played with a broken hand, and when he dropped his pick toward the end of the show he just played the string with his fingers. A fine, red spackling, a few smears and a couple of bloody finger prints marred the otherwise colorless face of his guitar by the time he was done.\n\nIt's a sure sign of dedication when a band literally sheds their own blood to keep a show moving along, and all of the pain and frenetic energy the group displayed paid off."}
{"text":"The new album from punk\/funk\/electro trio Black Dice can be filed under \"hard to love.\" While there's no doubting that the Brooklyn natives' know their way around a studio and their credentials as noise terrorists are unquestioned, the tracks on Mr. Impossible are more often than not as impregnable as the Jonas Brothers' under-crackers, and the stuttering, syncopated sci-fi sounds of 'Rodriguez' and 'Pigs' suffer from a distinct lack of hooks. Yes, I agree that the trio have imagination and ambition by the bucket-load, but their invention and wizardry just aren't enough to warrant repeat listens."}

Her music is a raw, dirging doom-folk with hints of black metal, deep blues and minimal synthesizer music, but it's as prone to triumph as it is despair.

Even tales of unrequited love \"end up being deeper than being about liking a girl,\" he says. \"It ends up about me wanting to live life to its fullest. There's something going on in life, but there's always something going on inside your soul, about me, about God, about everything.\"\n\nCarrescia identifies himself as a Christian, but says, \"I definitely don't like the label \"Christian music.'

{"text":"Arts Watch Roundup.\n\nEcho and the Bunnymen: There's a significant distinction...\n\nNovember 03, 1997|By Kevin McKeough.\n\nEcho and the Bunnymen: There's a significant distinction between dreamy and sleepy, but it eluded the recently reunited Echo and the Bunnymen during the Liverpool band's 90 minute performance at Metro Saturday night. Instead of the fever-dream intensity he brought to his gothic melodies in the 1980s, singer Ian McCullough relied on a subdued croon for both old favorites (\"The Cutter\") and new material (\"Nothing Lasts Forever\"). McCullough summoned some genuine fervor to a few songs, such as \"The Back of Love,\" but for the most part he played it cool, never shedding his fur-collared overcoat nor exerting himself enough to make it necessary. Accompanied by three additional musicians, moody lighting, and lots of fog, Will Sergeant's ringing, droning lead guitar and Les Pattinson's surging bass provided plenty of atmosphere. Without a stronger focal point, though, the songs got swallowed up in the haze rather than enveloping the listener."}

{"text":"Album Review: Vince Roy \u2013 \"Unreasoning Animals\"\n\nVince Roy is a hardcore punk band that takes influence from a variety of post prefixed genres without ever succumbing to them. Which in simpler terms means they don't rely on power chords to fuel the fire in their music, instead embracing riffs, leads, and whatever-the-hell-else hardcore bands don't traditionally use. Vince Roy isn't an experimental or progressive band by any means, they're just picking and choosing through a long list of punk rock's sonic vocabulary and applying the words as they see fit. The end result is something akin to a more raw, and instrumentally busy Comeback Kid. Unreasoning Animals is the band's debut full length, forcefully putting Vince Roy on the map as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWhat struck me most about Unreasoning Animals was how quickly it stuck. Hardcore isn't a catchy genre. It's a powerful, raw, emotional one, but musically it doesn't tend to stick with you. It all goes back to its devotion to rhythm over melody, a rule that governs not only the instruments but the vocals. It's fitting too, rhythm is primal and base\u2013 something you feel in your bones\u2013 perfect for hardcore. \"Fear\/Loathing\" is permeated with great fretwork, allowing muted single notes to carry the verse and then exploding into a twisting off kilter melody for the chorus. \"Scissoring\" is another fantastic track, featuring hammer on\/pull off lead that lends the track a sense of movement. It's because of their impressive mastery of the riff that Unreasoning Animals is so good from start to finish, never feeling stagnant, and always stimulating.\n\nLyrically, Unreasoning Animals is what one would expect from the current crop hardcore bands\u2013 angry, but introspective words unhindered by melody. But, Vince Roy are slightly more direct than their peers, more menacing and a bit more fierce. This doesn't detract from their sound at all, but it does make their imagery all the more visceral and unique\u2013 I mean, c'mon, in one song they're talking about being surrounded by blood drenched lizard-people. What's more hardcore than that?\n\nVince Roy combat the potential tedium always inherent in hardcore by keeping Unreasoning Animals short and sweet. At only nine songs long, and only taking about twenty-one minutes of time to consume, it leaves the listener wanting more. Perhaps, that's the key to the album's quality, a strategic avoidance of oversaturation. A way to not let the audience hear so much that they discover all the tricks up the musicians sleeves. But, the truth is that Vince Roy have simply written and performed a quality record, and no one aspect is owed responsibility\u2013 everything they do, they do right. Unreasoning Animals is an album that arrests you with its intensity and keeps you intrigued with its musicality\u2013 Vince Roy is a band to watch on the horizon"}

{"text":"The black and gray cover of Wes Willenbring's new album, predisposes us for an encounter with an artist whose uncompromising vision may become either overbearing or revealing of greater truths that can only be deciphered through music. Not any music can do that of course, as not everyone is willing to push the boundary of sound, or use the experience of living in a post-industrial world as a source of inspiration to make something truly original, but most importantly esoteric.\n\nWillenbring with Weapons Reference Manual makes a convincing argument for the fact that the transition into a post-industrial world hasn't transformed the essentials of the human condition, as the grayness that remains at the heart of human civilization is still the main factor that guides our every move. Experimenting with tones, drones, mechanic background noise, distorted drums and guitar, he builds dark atmospheres which embrace the listeners and present them with a sense of danger. His music evolves like a being born in the darkness, moving like dark clouds, preparing us for a storm that may or may not come, but will surely affect our vision of the world (whether it will be for the better or the worse, remains to be seen and depends on our perspective the same way the Mayan prophesies of an impending doom or the dawn of an era of enlightenment, are interpreted depending on what each one of us wants to believe).\n\nLike a soundtrack to William Blake's trip from normality to a fictional city named Machine at the end of the world in Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, Willenbring's music tells us the story of a long train trip with no end in sight, the monotonous sound of the train's engines becoming a part of life, in a way that we couldn't have imagined before. While all that sounds depressing, it surely isn't. The correct word is detached, as Willenbring has abandoned the emotional touches of his previous works, and seems to observe the story he's writing from a distance.\n\nHis work is meticulous, serious, at times hypnotic, but also capable of keeping the listener wide awake. This isn't an album about the world's beauty, but about recklessness, people disappearing every day, and dreams that will never be realized. It's a wake-up call and meditation music for those willing to deep deeper into the most uncomfortable thoughts of our collective consciousness."}
{"text":"September 25, 2007\n\nThe Go! Team wears out its charm\n\nA few years ago, the bedroom auteur behind the Go! Team -- Ian Parton -- assembled his favorite music into a Frankenstein creation called \"Thunder Lightning Strike.\"\n\nThe album was constructed mostly out of seemingly incompatible samples, a m\u00e9lange of dirty Sonic Youth-style guitars, chanted double-dutch vocals and the type of blaring horns that played over car-chase scenes in forgotten TV shows.\n\nSomehow, it worked. The 2004 disc was nominated for England's prestigious Mercury Prize, and Parton assembled a co-ed multiracial band to take his solo project on the road.\n\nThe follow-up, \"Proof of Youth\" (Sub Pop), is essentially \"Thunder\" Pt. 2, with the touring band now sharing time with Parton's funk samples in the studio. The vocalists cheerlead and chant as much as sing, and the busy mixes still buzz, beep and burble.\n\nThe dense sound collages of vintage Public Enemy albums are an obvious inspiration, so it's no accident that rapper Chuck D appears on one of Parton's new songs, \"Flashlight Fight.\" But whereas Public Enemy's Bomb Squad spliced dozens of seemingly mismatched samples into crushing walls of sound, the Go! Team production is scratchy, thin and top heavy. Where's the bass? How come the vocals sound like they're muffled by insulation?\n\n\"Proof of Youth\" is designed to be heard over a boom box, a broken car stereo, or through the tiny speakers of a computer or MP3 player --- anything but a decent stereo system. Parton's low-fi aesthetic can have a certain charm. But without stronger songs, two albums based on charm are one too many"}

One word that came to me belatedly was \"prayer,\" though \"invocation\" also works, and neither are quite right.\n\n\"New Amerykah\" isn't political or social in the sense that the lyrics are specific complaints, or that Badu is concerned with a particular set of conventions. What \"New Amerykah\" does is revive and reimagine a black American pop aesthetic that is happy to speak uncomfortable truths, and suggests a different way of filtering the world through pop music.

{"text":"More About\n\nWHEN CIBO MATTO released its first single, 1994's unhinged, organ-curdled rant \"Birthday Cake,\" they sounded like nothing else on college radio. Japanese-born New York City singer Miho Hatori and compatriot multi-instrumentalist Yuka Honda made hectic, food-obsessed art-hop about life in the hectic, food-obsessed city they called home, layering the dense beats with a cryptic gastro-sensualism and an oddly confrontational intensity: \"Extra sugar\/Extra salt,\" yelled Hatori through layers of distortion, \"Extra oil and MSG!\/Shut up and eat!\"\n\nWhatever its source--or its aim--this hungry rage promised delicious fun for anyone who believed that Hatori and Honda could keep it up. Sadly, in the two years that elapsed between the release of \"Birthday Cake\" and Viva! La Woman, the full-length album that eventually surrounded it, Cibo Matto went from making weird jump-around party music to crafting boring trip hop for young elites to dance to distractedly after catching the duo on Buffy. The praise heaped upon that platter focused mostly on identity politricks, belying the fact that this unfunky record was only intermittently more interesting than kindred culinary trip popper DJ Food. The contrast between single and album was something like the difference between a junk shop and a boutique. The latter may be neater and more organized, but it's nowhere near as fun.\n\nNow comes the new Stereotype A, which feels closer to shopping at the Gap: \"hip,\" sterile, and vaguely unpleasant. The Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake-aided grab bag of sonic oddities that pervaded even the sleepiest moments of Viva! is gone, replaced by a scrubbed sonic sheen that's nearly antiseptic.\n\nThe exceptions--the dinky Japanglish geek-rap of \"Sci-Fi Wasabi,\" the dreary metal parody \"Blue Train\"--stand out only because they're so damned irritating. Sophomore albums usually are a showcase for growth, but the only evidence of artistic advancement here is that the songs aren't all about food."}

{"text":"No related\n\nOne would think a band called Tapes 'N Tapes would get a lot of questions about, well, tapes, but apparently that's not the case. Instead, these local blog darlings do most of their talking about their music, including answering various questions about Outside, their latest record. The A.V. Club couldn't let that lack of tape-related questioning stand, so we cornered guitarist Josh Grier before the band's show Sunday at Turf Club with blog fodder Howler, to talk about cassettes, duct tape, and Pee-wee Herman.\n\nThe A.V. Club: Why are you called Tapes 'N Tapes?\n\nJosh Grier: Basically, before the band started, a buddy and I had a few late night recording sessions where we'd improvise songs. We'd have some beers, set a kitchen timer, and record. When that timer went off, the song was over. It was just a boundary so we wouldn't jam for hours and hours on end.\n\nSo, we did that for a couple of evenings and we made tapes and tapes of demos. I thought Tapes 'N Tapes would be a funny band name, so I bought a URL, made a fake band website, and told my buddy that now that we had a website, we were a band.\n\nAVC: You did put out a cassette of Outside, right?\n\nJG: We did 250 handmade tapes. Each one of us made custom artwork for about 75 of the tapes, and then we signed them.\n\nJG: I think it's good. I grew up listening to tapes. I had a Walkman, and I'd walk to school listening to my favorite tape. It's a nice portable format, and there's something endearing about a tape that's so worn out that it gets corroded.\n\nI also think there's something about getting a mix tape that's way different than getting a mix CD. They're just great.\n\nAVC: What was on your favorite tape?\n\nJG: When I was really little, like grade school, my favorite tapes were The Beatles' White Album and Beatles '65. I had some old Bob Dylan stuff, too. Those were my go-to jams.\n\nAVC: Have you ever gotten or given a mix tape that you've been especially into?\n\nJG: I've gotten a few really good mix tapes. I haven't gotten one in a long time, but when I was in high school, me and my friends would make each other tapes. It was something to do and they were always great. One day, someone would just be like, \"Hey I made you and five other people this tape of songs I've been listening to. Check it out.\" It was a wonderful middle-of-April surprise.\n\nAVC: Do you still have your tapes? I have mine in a drawer, but I don't have a tape player to listen to them on.\n\nJG: I totally have mine in a drawer, too. I know exactly where they are. I have a couple of drawers filled with tapes, actually. There are mixtapes and bootleg concert tapes, stuff like that. I just couldn't bring myself to part with them.\n\nI do have a cassette player, though. I don't use it very much.\n\nAVC: Did you own a lot of VHS tapes when you were little? What was your favorite?\n\nJG: When I was a kid, one of my favorites was UHF, the \"Weird Al\" movie. I would watch it over and over again. It's a pretty classic movie, and it's definitely one of those where the longer you watch it, you get those white lines on the screen, and it enhances the B movie aesthetic of the whole thing. It's better on a worn out VHS tape. That's the highest form of that movie.\n\nAVC: Do you ever think it's ironic that you're a band that's named for a sort of outdated format, but you guys really broke on the Internet?\n\nJG: I guess that's the dichotomy of analog and digital. When we started out, it was right around when people really started using the Internet to get music, so that's kind of funny. I guess I never really put too much thought into it, though.\n\nAVC: You're on tour right now. Do you have duct tape in the van?\n\nJG: Yes, we have duct tape, scotch tape, gaffer's tape, colored gaffer's tape. That stuff's the most fun to play with, by the way, the colored tape. It's about a quarter of an inch thick and it comes in 10 different colors. You can tape on things if you get bored on the road and it comes off easily. It's good for artwork.\n\nAVC: Have you guys ever used duct tape to fix one of your instruments on tour?\n\nJG: I've used duct tape and gaffer's tape for a lot of things, totally. Recently, I made the poor decision of using duct tape to hang posters on the wall in my basement and, surprisingly, it doesn't hold very well to paint. I have all these sticky marks all over my wall because they all fell down. So it's all grimy now and my wife is like, \"Really, you thought this was a good idea?\" I mean, it seemed like a better idea than holes in the wall, but now we have both. Tape can be really tantalizing to use, though. It's right there and it's so easy.\n\nAVC: Do you remember when Pee-wee Herman would use scotch tape on his face to make his nose like a pig's and other crazy things? Did you ever do that?\n\nJG: Yeah! I remember that! He would tape his eyes in certain ways. I definitely did that when I was a kid. Boredom will lead to a lot of things, and tape can do all sorts of things. Luckily, I never rolled with a crew of people that would duct tape people to doors or poles or anything, but I knew people who did that kind of stuff.\n\nAVC: Thanks for talking to us and have a safe trip. If you get bored, use that scotch tape on your face. You'll be the most popular guy in the van.\n\nJG: Hopefully we won't have to tape up any tires. There are lots of blown-out tires where we are right now. I guess we could also rip our arm hair off with tape. That would be a good way to stay awake. I'm going to spend the rest of the ride thinking about all the things I can do with tape."}

For their last LP they even consented to interviews (earlier media appearances had been sulky and monosyllabic, tooth-pulling exercises for all involved). Then, 18 months ago, singer Jonsi Birgisson released a solo project that was almost a pop album (or at least, a pop album as recorded by someone with a working knowledge of Olde Elvish).

{"text":"PEER REVIEW: BEACH HOUSE @ WILBUR 10.15.12\n\nMy friend, Sara, recently moved to Argentina. Before she left, I asked her what led to this spur-of-the-moment decision. She told me that it was always something she had thought about doing, and one rainy day she listened to too much Beach House and decided to just buy the damn plane ticket.\n\nIn my mind, that is the precursor to any discussion about this band.\n\nThis is a cliche but I swear it's true: if Victoria Legrand and Co. didn't invent the \"dream pop\" genre, they certainly perfected it.\n\nTheir latest, Bloom, is nearly flawless: mellow synthesizers and ethereal guitars over Legrand's deep wail create less of a sound and more of a texture. This is not an album for active listening, but for daydreaming. The lyrics don't really matter (although they're often pretty interesting and\/or poetic), and even the individual instruments aren't something you can pay attention to when you put the record on.\n\nRather, Beach House has recorded a series of profound feelings; the perfect backing track to daydreams, the sounds you hear when you're having an epiphany, what it sounds like to find yourself in a new and strange place.\n\nThat all probably sounds a bit too profound, so let me also add that the live Beach House experience, caught at the Wilbur this week, is not exactly like the recorded one. Live, the show is hypnotic (yeah, I said it, and yeah, it probably goes without saying), but it provides tried and true Beach House fans an opportunity to dissect where those conjured emotions come from and to really understand how they got that perdy sound.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't know that behind tracks like \"Irene\" and \"Myth\" there were actual people playing real instruments, I just never really thought about it until it was right in front of me.\n\nFor example, I realized that Alex Scally was actually a pretty good guitar player (he pulled off that really fast, steady one-note thing that Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner does pretty much always). Also, Legrand's voice is actually kind of insane. I'm fairly certain she couldn't miss a note if she tried. Rather than a separate piece of a musical whole, she uses her voice very instrumentally. The breathy heaves she implements in the beginning of songs like \"Lazuli\" are almost like a bizarre drum machine. Plus her tone is so deep and rich that it evokes strings across a cello more than it evokes a person. All things I learned from their live show!\n\nBottom line: if you're not already a fan of the band, I'm not really sure what you will get out of their live show other than a dreamy (sometimes potentially sleepy) experience.\n\nBut if you're already into Beach House, you'll get new insights into this awesome three-piece, and also maybe you'll buy a plane ticket to Argentina.

{"text":"Night Shades\n\nAlbum Review\n\nIt's hard to get a fix on an album that has credits from members of Le Tigre, a guy who produced Susan Boyle and Il Divo, hip-hop hitmakers Stargate, American Idol's Kara DioGuardi, the great Arthur Baker, and ubiquitous songwriter-for-hire Ryan Tedder. Throw in vocals by the French all-girl band Plastiscines and Britney collaborator Sabi, a rap by Mac Miller, and some help from the unfortunately named Brooklyn pop band Jump into the Gospel, and it would seem that Cobra Starship may have gone a bit overboard on their fourth album, Nightshades. Packing so many WTFs into one ten-song record is hardly fair, a bit reckless, and ultimately (amazingly) successful. You don't come to a Cobra Starship record looking for artistic development or big statements, especially since Gabe Saporta started them off as a joke band and they've operated as such ever since. Not that there's anything wrong with that when they can make the joke work so well. Roping in such a weird mix of collaborators actually works in their favor, as the mix of sounds, styles, and ideas makes for a super enjoyable listen. Any album with a song that sounds like a New Order\/OMD mash-up (the Baker-mixed \"Anything for Love\"), one that sounds like a Weezer ballad from the Green album (\"You Belong to Me\"), another that sounds like a snotty Bruno Mars track (\"Fool Like Me\"), and one that sounds like emo-Rihanna (\"You Make Me Feel...\") is an album that's hitting lots of pop sweet spots. There are even a few songs that sound a little bit original, like the boy\/girl (the girl being the group's keytar player, Victoria Asher) dance-pop duet \"Disaster Boy\" and the Le Tigre co-write \"Shwick,\" which brings a touch of credible melancholy to the party with the lyrics about not believing in stupid love songs. Ultimately you could credit the outside writers and producers for the album's success, but also save some love for the bandmembers themselves. Saporta and crew have plenty of pop smarts and savvy to go around and they bring the right amount of sweetness and silliness to the album. Nightshades is ridiculously fun and light, sure to spawn at least a couple of songs you'll want to play at ironic dance parties, summer blowouts, and maybe even over headphones when you need some (mostly) mindless cheering up. What more could you want from Pop music?"}

{"text":"Interview #185: Night Of The Brain\n\nFri, 2007-06-15 08:28\n\nCristian Vogel is a composer and music producer, known for his experimental DJ and Live performances, studio composition and production. Born in Chile 1972 but growing up in the UK, he now lives and works in Barcelona.\n\nCristian has toured consistently since 1992 as a DJ and live performer, as a solo artist and also with Jamie Lidell as 'Super Collider'. Of late, he has been singing and playing guitar in his new band Night of the Brain. As a studio remixer, he has been invited to reinterpret songs by artists as diverse as Radiohead, Maximo Park, Thom Yorke, Juan Atkins and many others. Cristian Vogel's producer credits include albums for Chicks On Speed, Panico, Vir\u00fcs, Las Perras del Infierno and others. As if that wasn't enough, Cristian Vogel has also been behind four independent record labels, Station 55 Records, Rise Robots Rise Records, Mosquito Records and Sleep Debt Records.\n\nWe caught up with Cristian Vogel to talk about Night Of The Brain, playing live in a band as opposed to as a DJ and his take on remixing.\n\n\"I Like Music because\u2026 it's loud and quiet at the same time.\" Cristian Vogel, Night Of The Brain\n\nILM: Your new album Wear This World Out is out now, released on June 4th. Can you tell us which of the tracks did you have the most fun laying down. Which one sticks out for you?\n\nCristian: Mmm, yeah. They were all fun to do and some of them came together in a lovely easy straight forward sort of way which is fun for someone who's been making music for a long time. I like the song, Vicky The Tall, because it's got some fun stories behind it and it was straightforward and was one of the last ones to go on. We'd actually finished the record and I had a crazy weekend and wrote the song really fast after that weekend and called everyone up and said, 'we've got to record to it now!' So everyone dropped everything, came over and it was almost like, 'one two three four, let's go\u2026' and we recorded it.\n\nILM: So I'm presuming the track is about someone called Vicky who's tall?\n\nCristian: Yeah, it's about something that happened at this arts do I was DJing at. It was an art installation and a 6ft transvestite called Vicky smashed it up and it was a really exciting and funny thing, so I tried to put it all into a song.\n\nILM: Can you describe the Christian Vogel (Night Of The Brain) process of writing and recording such good music?\n\nCristian: When you're writing electronic instrumental music it's kind of like a blank canvas; there aren't any rules about what you can do, so it's quite difficult in that respect to write good songs. With electronic music its better to write songs that have exciting sounds and a good beat. So this a major difference, because this stuff is all songs, they all have beginnings, choruses and things, so it's pretty much trying to flesh out the ideas I have for songs, which tend to come from the songs first and flesh them out with the band so they're playable by a band. In the past I've written music that was completely unperformable. With my band Super Collider that I was in with Jamie Liddell, we'd write stuff that was just unperformable so we'd have to start again from scratch in order to go out live. Whereas this time I thought, why don't we make sure we can play it before we record it. So that was something that defined the studio sound; we wanted to have it pretty much played, rather than all chopped up and edited and sequenced together in impossible ways, and this has really influenced the song writing process for sure.\n\nILM: And how about remixing, you've done a lot of that too?\n\nCristian: Well, remixing is a strange thing. I don't know what your views on it are. It's always struck me as quite an odd thing to do, with strange motives. In the 90s it was all about trying to reach into the dance market for a band, and trying to put a dance beat behind a hit song. Whereas nowadays, Radiohead or Thom York will ask me to remix something and, clearly, they don't want me to turn it into the house anthem for the summer. So I think Thom's asked me to do that in the past because he likes to reinterpret his work. Have it reinterpreted in a way so that he can maybe learn something about it and the fans can appreciate the song from a different perspective, which I think is a pretty good thing, so with that in mind, the one I did for Maximo Park was a favourite and stays with me.\n\nILM: And it must be nice to, alongside making your own music, reinterpret somebody else's?\n\nCristian: Yeah, it makes connections with people. I'm always surprised that guys like Radiohead or Maximo Park have been listening to my techno music for f***ing years. They'd call me up and say we love your beats and I always thought that was really strange, but now I realise that's just like me, I also listen to lots of other types of music, not just the style of music that I like to make. I like to check out everything. With the band, I hope it doesn't freak people out too much that I'm into doing songs and singing because, for me, it's quite a natural organic thing.\n\nILM: You are showcasing at Sonar this year. What can fans expect from the show?\n\nCristian: Yeah, in 40 minutes or something, it's a short set, so a fast run through. We've been playing quite a bit and have done a few shows in Brussels and Berlin and have rehearsed a lot, so they can expect to hear songs from the album but grown in a live context, which is how good songs should do and good bands should let the song just grow themselves, so the more you play them, the more colourful and energetic they might become, rather than just repeating the same old tunes off the album, you'd hope you can inject a new level of energy into it when you see it live. So that's what he hope to do anyway.\n\nILM: You have toured A LOT over the years, what do you look forward to the most about playing live? Is it that evolving nature of songs or connecting with the audience?\n\nCristian: Playing on stage with a band and playing songs with an audience is one of the best experiences that a musician can have I think. It's quite difficult and there can be quite emotional and turbulent times, but when you're up there on stage and playing it's really rewarding. I've found I've done a lot of DJing and it's essentially an empty experience. On this level it's not the same at all. You do much longer sets and you get more tired and people aren't giving you back the same kind of energy, whereas when you play your songs live and you're in a group dynamic and you know each other really well. People come to see a group of people they're interested in and it's like they're doing something quite intimate and inviting you in. It's important that there's a good energy and good vibe y'know, rather than be the most technically proficient loudest bad ass bad in the universe, I'm not into that, I'm more interested in creating a good atmosphere and good energy, so people come to see a concert and enjoy it.\n\nILM: You're very creative and the artwork for your album features a local artist. Will you always be interested in involving art and other creative areas in your work?\n\nCristian: Artwork is always a great reason to connect with other people. Artists need different outlets for their work, because it's interesting for them, not just on a commercial level. Here's my painting, it's associated with this piece of music now, do I like it more or do I like it less? Y'know? And also I tend to work with artists who like to collaborate because we're independent and there's not budget involved, people who are interested in it when it's not about the money, you can then work together to make an interesting product.\n\nILM: Is there a piece of software or hardware that you couldn't live without?\n\nCristian: My flying ukelele, which is a white flying v. The flying uke. That's the latest edition and if you took it from me I'd be sad, and some electronic instruments I've had for a really long time that have been part of my life for some time. And, more recently, my guitar. Although I'm not giving it too much love, and treating it a bit bad.\n\nILM: Loads of people are using the internet these days and getting their music out there before even getting a record deal. How has the internet effected you and your music?\n\nCristian: It's been good to get some quite raw ideas out straight away, although a lot of artists don't like putting unfinished products out there. But I like doing it because it gives some momentum to your original idea and makes you want to improve it straight away. Sometimes I used to do live broadcasts from the studio during the creation of stuff, and some people were tuning in to that to hear the process of being creative and recording; kind of like hanging round a studio, but online. So bringing the creative edge closer to the people who are going to be enjoying and consuming it; the internet helps on that level.\n\nThe other cool thing is the public are a lot less anonymous than they were before. Before you'd put a record out and the record label would tell me you'd sold x many thousand records and you'd think: Who bought that? Who are these people? But now you get a tangible sense of who they are. Through last.fm and stuff I've got quite a good idea of who is interested in the music I'm making, their faces and names, so it's less inpersonal.\n\nILM: You have a huge wealth of experience, you must have learnt a lot about music and the music industry so far. Have you got any advice for young producers\/songwriters\/Dj's\/bands looking to come into music industry?\n\nCristian: Just to get it clear from the start what they want out of it. It's unlikely to make a living from music, not many people do. I'm barely scraping by myself and I've been doing it for 15 years and other people who get successful enough, it doesn't last very long. So its important to focus on what you want out of your music; if you just want to get a CD out at some shows, that's perfectly all right and something to aim for. That's fun to share your music with others.\n\nILM: What are the future plans for Night Of The Brain?\n\nCristian: We've missed most of the festivals except Sonar. So we'll take a break until autumn and play this album out; in the meantime I'm writing some new material. It's an itch I can't scratch, making music.\n\nILM: What's the best and worst thing about Barcelona (where you're now living)?\n\nCristian: I like my studio and that I've been able to set one up here. There's a relaxed ambition here in Barcelona. People do have ambition to do big things and be great but it's not the same as in London or LA, it's not as cut throat as some of the other cities; people aren't scrabbling to get to the top, they're just interested in doing good quality stuff and exploring different artforms and music forms. This suits me, it's much more relaxed.\n\nThe worst thing is lack of trees. There aren't any big parks, although we do have the beaches. Sometimes you go to Berlin and see a massive park with loads of trees and you think 'oh, we don't have that'.\n\nILM: Jazz is a science. Discuss.\n\nCristian: Well if you want to study jazz it can become quite scientific and mathematical. It's strange though that jazz has become so academic and institutionalised, which may happen with rock n roll one day, the mathematics of rock n roll. You know\u2026 there's only one number that's important\u2026 number one! [laughs]."}
{"text":"Not long ago, I came across a band by the name of Nerves Junior that really blew me away. Who were these guys and where did they come from? This is the type of music the world needs to hear and support-- Nerves Junior is good music. Their full length album As Bright As Your Night Light, is one of my top albums of 2011 and hopefully will be yours too. Check out the interview with founding member Cory Wayne.\n\nWas there a strategy behind the mystery of who Nerves Junior is? For example was being more mysterious at first a way to spark curiosity? No, being mysterious was not intentionally a way to spark more interest, we are just chronically unorganized.\n\nWhere does the band name come from and what does it represent to you guys? The band name is a very silly silly idea. I wanted to be called The Nerves but there is already a pretty rad, pseudo \"popular\" band with that title. I was listening to a lot of Dinosaur Jr. at the time, who also found themselves in a similar predicament way back when, so we took a cue from them.\n\nYou're from Louisville, how is the music scene in that area? The music scene here is weird, but I feel like it is getting better. For example, I think we are the only \"indie\" band with a drum machine. But the punk and garage scene is off the chains.\n\nHow would you describe your sound and style of music? Our sound and style is a direct bastard. Organic Electro-Pop\u2026\u2026I'm just a lover of sounds, and while we explore a lot of different sounds, the constants are definitely the crisp punch of a snare on a drum machine that never changes, open string tunings, thick bass, et al.\n\nAs Bright As Your Night Light is one of my favorite albums of the year, can you explain briefly about the concept\/process of the album? The album is a sort of concept about losing your mind in a desert and trying to recover. There's a lot of commentary on the direct influences of my own feelings, lovers, lack of money, drugs, dreaming in the daytime.\n\nWhat does the title of the album represent? It represents a combination of childlike sleep and the ability of certain things to shine threw the dark no matter what.\n\nI'm always a sucker for interesting cover art and for some reason As Bright As Your Nights' stands out a lot to me. Who designed the cover and what was the thought behind that? IT WAS ALL LOGAN REULET, and the art he created totally captured the childlike wonderment I was just speaking on.\n\nIf you had to chose your favorite song on the album what would it be? Least favorite (if you have one)? My favorite song is \"Champagne with Peaches,\" in my eyes there is a certain balance to it that\u2026 i dunno\u2026 it seems to speak to my beauty strings, the machines and instruments speak to each other very clearly\u2026 all call and response. I don't dislike any of the songs - if there was a weak link, it would've stayed on the cutting room floor.\n\nAny upcoming tour dates? No tour dates as of yet\u2026 working on getting a van first.\n\nWho is one artist or band you'd love to go on tour with? Clinic\u2026 very very badly. We'd be down with Lady Gaga too.\n\nLastly, what can we expect in the future of Nerves Junior? I dunno at the time, hopefully minimalism and more dancing, more fuzz, and more analog bass"}
{"text":"Rhythmix\n\nCuneiform; 2002\n\nArtists:\n\nFind it at:\n\nOnce upon a time, Univers Zero were the scariest band on the block, the one that lived in the house at the end of the road with the high iron fence and unkempt lawn, their activities inside kept secret from the world outside. Early records like Heresie and Ceux du Dehors were terrifying walks through the valley of death, a chamber ensemble wheezing out moaning studies in extremely unpleasant texture and gripping dissonance. I don't know what kind of childhoods kids in Belgium have, but that country has managed to produce some of the world's most frightening bands, and Univers Zero were, without question, the most terrifying.\n\nRhythmix is Univers Zero's second album since the band reformed in 1999 after a 13-year hiatus, and if nothing else, it proves that they're still very bizarre. At its best, Rhythmix sounds like the Merry-Go-Round breaking down in some gruesome alternate dimension; at its worst, it sounds like a troupe of mall goths found their way into the keyboard section of Sam Ash and messed with the \"spooky\" presets.\n\nTechnology is a mixed blessing for older bands, offering an inviting array of new possibilities, but frequently leading them astray. And so it goes that, on Rhythmix, drummer and band leader Daniel Denis fails most frequently when he attempts to use new technology to his advantage, sticking a \"pizzicato string section\" keyboard setting into passages for which he couldn't hire actual violinists. He and co-producer Didier de Roos also shy away from the dry, unaffected sound that made Univers Zero's early albums so brutal and direct, which robs the otherwise well-composed music of some of its potential impact. Somehow, they also manage to record some of the \"real\" instruments, like Michael Berckmans' woodwinds and Bart Maris' trumpet in such a way that they sound as though they're synthesized.\n\nStill, even with its relatively neutered sound, the album manages quite a few genuinely disquieting moments, such as \"Waiting for the Sun\" (not a Doors cover), which features Bart Quartier's glockenspiel front and center and sends the other instruments to the back to scrape out a dark corner for it to sit in. \"The Fly-Toxmen's Land\" is ferociously rhythmic and even spastic at times, building to an intense coda wherein Denis pulverizes his drums for your edification while the rest of the band holds a quivering drone behind him, completely subverting the rock vein the song begins in.\n\nElsewhere, the music is frenzied, but hampered by the production. Eric Plantain plays a pretty badass bass, but it has this bright Tony Levin tone to it for the first few tracks that just doesn't gel with the music. Thus, the staggering processional, \"Terres Noires (Blacklands)\", sounds more awkward than it was probably intended to-- the idea and composition is great, but the fake harpsichord and slap-bass suck the evil straight out of it.\n\nAnd that's really my biggest beef with Rhythmix. Superficially, it sounds like Univers Zero-- but without the evil, what do you have? Just another wanky prog band, I'm afraid. And while these guys are in no danger of becoming Liquid Tension Experiment anytime soon, they are risking becoming their own pale shadow, and that would be a sad waste, indeed. I urge you to give these guys a chance, but don't start here."}
{"text":"Picks and Pans Review: Cracker\n\nCracker is to rock and roll what animal crackers are to fine dining. Neither offers much elegance or nutrition, but both are fun to nibble.\n\nWhile this is Cracker's first barrel o' tunes, lead singer-songwriter David Lowery comes direct from another oddball group, Camper Van Beethoven. He has brought with him not only his strained, slightly off-key vocals but that band's irreverent altitude.\n\nLess than a minute into the first song, \"Teen Angst (What the World Needs Now),\" you get a pretty good idea of the wonderful weirdness going on. Jangly, countryish guitar meets a rock backbeat, accompanied by Lowery bleatingly admitting that \"what the world needs now is another folk singer like I need a hole in my head.\" Next they roll in an up-tempo folkie number, \"Happy Birthday to Me,\" followed by the funky bop of \"This Is Cracker Soul.\"\n\nIs Cracker a folk record? Is it a rock record? Is it a country record? Lowery and company don't let themselves get pinned down, probably because they don't know the answer. It almost seems like the band made up the songs as they went along, which may not make for perfectly polished music but does give the disc a refreshing spontaneity.\n\nAll that matters here, apparently, is that no song takes itself too seriously. How else can you explain a ballad called \"Can I Take My Gun to Heaven?\" This is one Cracker made of nothing but wry. (Virgin)"}

{"text":"Amy Macdonald Interview\n\nAmy Macdonald Interview\n\nAmy Macdonald Interview\n\nScottish singer\/songwriter, Amy Macdonald, shot to fame with her debut album 'This Is The Life' in 2007. Since then she has been performing live alongside artists such as Paul Weller and U2. A few weeks before the release of 'A Curious Thing', Amy tells us a bit about the new album and her achievements so far.\n\nYour debut album was released in 2007. Can you tell me a bit about what you have been up to since then? It's just been constant for me. The album came out in 2007 and gradually became successful all over Europe. So I've just been touring Europe and doing lots of promos. I only did my last gig from that album at the end of September. We had to cut it off really because it was going on forever.\n\nI've not really had a break to be honest, although I suppose for the UK it must seem like I have disappeared off the face of the planet.\n\nWhat has been the highlight so far? There have been so many, I have just done so many incredible things all over the world, played to so many amazing audiences, and played with so many incredible artists. I mean, I was told by U2 that they were my fans.\n\nYou are still just 22, does this all seem real to you? It doesn't, and it still doesn't. This whole job and my lifestyle are constantly surprising me and I would never take it for granted. I feel so lucky to be in this position because so many people would kill for this. I feel very honoured that people seem to like what I do.\n\nYou seem very down to earth; do you still manage to live a typically normal life? Definitely. 100%. I have always said that it is completely about the music, and I have never been interested in anything else. I think I've been able to maintain that. I'm a totally normal person, I don't get followed or have photographers waiting outside my door. So yes I have a very ordinary life.\n\nHave you always been singing and playing? Since I was about 15 I've always been singing, had my guitar, and been writing songs. So it's something I have been doing throughout my adult life.\n\nWas there anyone who inspired you to get into music? It was actually Travis with their album 'The Man Who' that made me want to play guitar, but they haven't really brought anything out since then. But that album inspired me to play.\n\nYour second album, 'A Curious Thing' is released in March. Tell me a bit about that. I'm really excited by it. For me, I'm really proud of the songs I have written. It's sort of a natural progression from the first album. When I wrote the first album I had never played live before, and I'd never been on tour. So that was really just me and my guitar. Now with this album I have literally played hundreds and hundreds of shows with my band, which means that when they are behind you, you are naturally a bit more edgy and a bit rocky, and that shows through a lot more with this album.\n\nDo you prefer playing solo, or with a band? I prefer playing with a band. It's good to do both, but for me it's quite exciting when I hear my songs completely transformed with the band behind me. You can really get into it more, and so can the audience.\n\nYour debut album, 'This Is The Life', went to number one in the album charts. How did you react to such a success? I remember I was in my car and we got told on the Friday that the album was already number three. It was thousands of copies behind Take That and Radiohead. But for me I was just happy to be in the company of those bands, and have the album behind two of the most successful bands. Then on the Sunday I got a call to say that it had overtaken them both and was at number one. I was just gobsmacked, I didn't expect that at all. I had to pull over and have a little scream to myself.\n\nDoes this put extra pressure on your new album? This is a new project, and I'm sure it would put pressure on me, but I try to purposefully not think about it. It's hard enough to come up with new songs and record them, but if I was thinking about all of the other things it would turn me into a nervous wreck.\n\nDo you write tracks from personal experience? Yes and no. It's hard for me to always explain my songs, and people always expect a meaning and to know what it's about. Sometimes when I write these songs I'm feeling a particular emotion, so to then come back and explain what I was feeling or put it into words is quite difficult. Sometimes I don't even know what they're about so I feel I have to make something up to make people understand a bit more.\n\nPaul Weller appears on your new album, how did that happen? I supported Paul Weller back in 2007, and I think that was probably the first tour that I did. He was just really nice. He stayed in touch, and even came to a few of my shows. He said to my manager that if we ever needed a studio to record in we could use his. So this album was actually recorded this album in his personal studio. It was just incredible. It had all of his memorabilia and awards there. It was just so much more inspiring being somewhere like that which had all of these things on the wall.\n\nHe came down for a couple of days and we managed to get him to do a bit of bass and guitar. It's not a massive collaboration, but he's on there, which is really cool for me.\n\nDo you have a favourite track on the album? I'm just so proud of all of them, and happy that they are all on there. My favourite one to perform live is the song 'No Roots'. It's just really special to me.\n\nI've heard that you are proud to say that you have not been auto tuned on your new album. Is this true? No, that's right, and I think it makes it more personal. When it's not quite perfect, I think that makes them more perfect if that makes any sense. One of my favourite bands is The Killers, and there are some things they sing which are off key a little bit, and to me that makes it perfect.\n\nNobody is perfect and I think that if you spend hours making everything in tune, people will be slightly disappointed when you sing live if you are slightly off key all of the time.\n\nEspecially when there is a lot of speculation over artists miming at the moment. Yeah I think a lot of people do hide behind auto tune and I don't think that's right when you have to perform live. You'll start to think, well who is the person singing on the record then because it's not the same person that's singing live.\n\nI think I sound exactly as I do on the album when I sing live, so everyone knows what to expect.\n\nYour first single, 'Don't Tell Me That It's Over' precedes the album release. Can you tell me a bit about the track? Yes. As with all of the songs I have tried to come up with a meaning for it, but the way I look at it now is that it's a song about dong something because you want to, and not because you think you have to. The example I use is the global warming issue. I think it's really important issue, but I also think that people should do something about it because they want to and they feel passionate, not because the government say you must stop driving or you must stop flying. I don't think that works.\n\nWhat have you got coming up in 2010? I will be touring in the UK early this year, but I've done so much across Europe that I will probably go back there. That won't be until the summer though.\n\nAt the moment I'm happy to be back in the UK, it's nice to work at a normal pace and not worry that people can't understand me. I'm looking forward to playing live in the UK, and to UK audiences because I have missed them. I just want to do my best, play as much as possible, and hope that people like what I do.\n\nI've got lots in my diary but we're just waiting for things to be confirmed, like festivals. It's all been spoken about and lots of things are in the air.\n\nYou've made some significant achievements in Germany. Yes, I think I've sold more than Amy Winehouse over there.\n\nBest International female. Yeah it's unbelievable, it seems to just work there. I have no explanation for it, I'm just very grateful.\n\nWho are you listening to at the moment? I listen to such a mixture of things. I was flying back from Switzerland last night and was listening to Sinatra, so that's a bit random. Then for albums at the moment I like the Kasabian album, I mean I'll listen to anyone really.\n\nWhat's the best advice you have been given so far? I think it would be from my mum, Just to try your best, and if people think that you're not good enough then that's their problem. As long as you've done your best then they can't really expect anything else from you."}
{"text":"Are The Roaring Night is by no means a perfect record, and there are minor flaws to stand alongside the frequent moments of brilliance, but what cannot be questioned is how skilled they are at shaping layers of sound to form an enveloping whole, with each overlapping texture or shifting tempo plunging the listener further and further into the darkness.\n\nIf you strip their sound to its core, like the harmonies and the distortion, you're left with an invariable rock record. If this isn't a true representation of what modern rock should be, I don't know what is."}

{"text":"Emerging from the same Bay Area psychedelic, garage pop scene that has produced The Fresh & Onlys, Sonny & The Sunsets and Girls, Shalants (pronounced like \"nonchalant\") produce a distinctly Californian sound. It's a mash-up of Mexican, Native American, Chinese, settler culture and pioneer spirits. The band split their time between San Francisco and the alpine wilderness of Shasta County, and their music is informed by everything between the Delta and the Bay. They recall a bygone era, but their music is not retro.\n\nMiller Carr, Shalants' chief singer and songwriter, comes descended from the original pioneers that founded San Francisco and the Jefferson State area. His family were gold rush chancers, his great-grandfather a county judge, his grandfather a District Attorney, and his father a liberal free-spirited lawyer turned brandy drinking river rat. The songs on Shalants trace Carr's own lineage and his bloodline's collected experience: from sailors and explorers to prospectors and religious asylum seekers; immigrants and ballroom piano players to whores and gunslingers; opium smokers and bohemians to anarchists and the beats; John Muir, Gary Snyder, Kerouac and Emperor Norton.\n\nThe band receives inspiration from California's terrain and topography. Their darkness emerges from the fog and the forests. Their playfulness and curiosity comes from the giants in the Shasta Cascades, their friends in the Sierras, and the rivers and meadows that wind around the canyons. The sea informs their longing and wanderlust. The music they make blows up their journeys and experiences, movie size: the dreamy foggy soundtrack to a lost Terrence Malick film.\n\nBut ultimately what makes the band so intriguing, whether it be by their live show or recorded work, is their subtle dynamics, voodoo telepathy, and warlike approach to performing. They will cut you down, but they'll also bury you afterwards, and make a little cross. The sound they make, like all honest things, is beautiful, meaningful, and harmonious, yet vulgar and dark. And they can play circles around anyone. You'll have trouble finding another group of guys so young that can play a Cole Porter-like ballad and then swing right into a minimalist Cramps-esque burner at the drop of the dime.\n\nThe new album's highlights include the dub-influenced, lyrically dense \"Riverbanking,\" the urgent propulsive plea of \"When It Comes,\" the swinging, shimmering voodoo of \"The Mercury Twins,\" the forlorn waltz of \"Black Jewels,\" and the gentle melancholy of \"The Deserter.\" It's an album-length dose of mania and wonder via a cocktail of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Tom Waits, The Walkmen, The Kinks and Neil Young.\n\nThe band will be performing up and down the West Coast throughout 2011."}
{"text":"Lambchop\n\nIt's hard to satisfactorily explain how a band as improbable as Lambchop \u2014 the variably personneled but generally absurdly large vehicle of perennially gruff Nashville fuddy-duddy Kurt Wagner \u2014 has made it through 20 years. But he and they have lasted that long, maintaining a modest but seemingly tarnish-proof profile, earning critical plaudits at every turn via a steady stream of willfully abstruse mutterings and stylistic stagnation (at least for the bulk of their career) in polite, ruminative, high-gloss mood music that's? so easy on the ears as to barely leave any impression at all. But it's equally hard not to be glad they're still around, especially when they keep making records like Mr. M (Merge), their 11th long-player, which feels vital and surprising despite being just as poetically mundane, laconically lush and beautifully inscrutable as everything else they've done.

Specifically while performing, though, probably the time I was hit in the head by a flying sausage, mid stride.\n\nWhat's your biggest achievement\/proudest moment so far?\n\nRecording an album was a huge milestone. That happened while staying in Michigan with the band Mike Mains & the Branches who I had met while on tour. They were kind enough to learn my songs and play on the album, as I was still generally a solo artist at that point.\n\nWhat are your plans for the future?\n\nWe're keen to start touring more throughout Australia. There's still so much of this country we're yet to see!\n\nWhat makes you laugh?\n\nBad harmonica solos. Groin fat. Rap metal. Parks and Rec.\n\nWhat pisses you off?\n\nPay parking. 6:20am. Monsanto.

{"text":"Armed simply with a laptop and the voice she was given, Cameron Mesirow is on the forefront of new musical technology. Known by her stage name Glasser, Mesirow creates syncopated, intricate melodies with layers and layers of vocals. Spinner sat down with the SXSW-bound electronic artist to talk about how she records and the philosophy behind her debut album 'Ring.'\n\nHow did you arrive with the name Glasser?\n\nGlasser was the name of a character in one of my dreams. A peripheral character. I just liked the name and, it turns out, it's a very common Jewish last name... I don't really remember what the real dream was. There was nothing that actually happened with this person; he was just around, and that was his name, and I woke up with it in my head.\n\nWhen listening to 'Ring,' your voice stands out obviously. Talk about developing your voice over the years.\n\nThere wasn't so much the discovery of the sound -- I think I tried really hard to figure out how to sound like other people for a long time. For instance, Joni Mitchell, who's a really big hero of mine: I wanted to try to write music like hers, and sing like her, for a really long time. I never really succeeded in doing either of those things, but then I was just in the mood to be writing music still. Then I realized, it wasn't about her -- it was more about my own form of expression and figuring out what I can do. Since she did something that was so uniquely hers, I could do something that was uniquely mine as well.\n\nDo you play every instrument on 'Ring?'\n\nI don't, actually. I sort of arranged each thing. Well that's not true; I worked with our producer as well. Most of the sounds you hear come from me -- a lot of the sounds, I made with my computer that were then recreated with real instruments, like drum beats and certain string parts and marimba parts, and those things were sort of redone.\n\nSo how do you go about constructing the songs that we hear on this album? Is it a lot of layering, or recording then going back and piecing it together?\n\nYea, Yes! It's all of those things. It's sort of something that seems to come over me. I have ideas that I follow and see if I can match what I'm hearing in my head as best as I can.\n\nDo you start with rhythm and then put your voice in last, or does your voice sort of guide everything?\n\nI've done both methods, I think they're both valid. Vocal melodies are obviously really important for me. I think that there's so much vocal layering on 'Ring,' because in some of the songs I couldn't figure out what the lead vocal melody would be, so I made like 15 and just kept them all. There are certain songs that are very driven by the beat -- for example, on the song 'Home,' I made such a confusing beat and I got thrown off and realized I was playing it differently in the second half of the song than I was in the first half of the song, and then it sort of dictated what the content would be and it all came together at once. I wrote it on an airplane.\n\nAre there any other weird places that you've recorded parts on?\n\nI think that the airplane is definitely the weirdest. All of the stuff I've written on airplanes has been the weirdest stuff I've done. But usually it's weird in a way that I'm happy with. One of the times, the airplane was so loud that I didn't actually hear what I was recording and ended up getting some really fun extra stuff.\n\nTo me there's sort of a tribal sound to 'Ring.' Can you talk about that?\n\nI suppose you're talking about 'Apply,' which is the one people so often refer to as tribal. At the time, when I was making those sounds in my head with the drums, I did not think I'm gonna make something tribal. I thought, 'I'm gonna make the most guttural sounding thing I can.' I think the word tribal comes up so much because tribal music is known for being physical and guttural, and that's the thing I was going for. I was making such cerebral sounding music that I wanted to make something physical as well.\n\nI read that there was a philosophical reason behind calling the album 'Ring.'\n\nWell, when I started out making 'Ring,' I wanted to do something that wouldn't just be a collection of songs -- it would be a whole. They would all be parts to a whole. So I started out thinking there were so many loops on my album, what if I could just make the album a giant loop that would start over when it ended, and that was one factor in it. When I went on making it, in that fashion, each song sort of had a pair that it went with, I mean a partner that it went with. Thematic partners throughout the songs and all of the songs related to that form of instability in one way or another, except for one that was all about the only thing in my life that I feel is stable, which is my best friend whom I love -- or my love for my best friend; that's the thing that's stable. So I sort of framed that stability, that core of stability, in these rings of instability symmetrically. So the first song relates thematically to the last song, and the second song relates to the second to last song, and so forth... until you get to the middle crown jewel.\n\nCatch Glasser's SXSW Sets on Thursday, March 17 at Central Presbyterian Church (200 E 8th St.) 10PM, and Friday, March 18 at Club de Ville (900 Red River) 12PM"}
{"text":"The 11 song album is a mix of brand new songs as well as Berlin's picks from Stagger's demo vault. The beautifully scathing \"Cities On Fire\" was written 8 years ago but was updated in the studio to document the Occupy Wall Street movement that was gaining momentum while the record was being made. There is a space floating between pop and punk, between folk and kickass, a sweet spot that Leeroy Stagger inhabits with buoyancy, acerbic wit and ridiculously catchy melodic hooks. Stagger's music combines tender honesty of the songwriter with a ballsy punk-rock swagger; he isn't afraid to call bullshit when he sees it, even when it's on himself. Acoustic strumming is balanced with tasty distortion, lilting balladeering with driving pop-punk sweetness.\n\nWhat people are saying about Leeroy Stagger"}
{"text":"Forgiveness Rock Record\n\nAlbum\n|\n\nThis is more like it.\n\nWhen Canadian indie-rock collective Broken Social Scene released its self-titled third album back in 2005, the strain of maintaining one of rock music's most unwieldy groups was starting to show. Now, after five years, lots of touring, and a few solo albums (not to mention the unexpected commercial success of singer Leslie Feist's The Reminder), Broken Social Scene have recaptured some of the sweetness and quirky majesty of their 2002 breakthrough, You Forgot it In People. The cast of players is as immense as ever (including members of Stars, Metric, Pavement, Tortoise, and the Weakerthans), and the scope is just as broad, but the songs themselves are some of the most gorgeous of the band's career. Tracks like \"Chase Scene\" and \"Sentimental X's\" flirt with weird synth sounds and evoke the pastoral soundscapes of earlier BSS records, while \"Meet Me In the Basement\" is the kind of anthemic, horn-filled showstopper that the band does better than pretty much anyone else.

{"text":"Friendly Fires is a British band consisting of Ed Macfarlane, Jack Savidge, and Edd Gibson, who came together to start their first group when they were thirteen years old. Yeah, thirteen, which makes me feel like I wasted my eighth grade year just being awkward, and going through puberty when really I should have been putting together my first indie band. But Ed, Jack and Edd realized they had the potential to be rock stars, put their awkwardness on the backburner, and started playing.\n\nIn 2008 they released their self-titled debut album, which turned out to be slow-burning but relatively successful. Friendly Fires trades in electronic pop music with serious disco dance sounds, along with buoyant sing-along lyrics and amusingly enough, samba percussion under it all. Feel-good, electronic, get-up-and-dance stuff. Check out their song \"Paris\".\n\nYouku Video:\n\nYou can basically hear what exuberance sounds like on \"Jump in the Pool\".\n\nYouku Video\n\nIn 2011 they released their second full-length album, Pala. The music sounds are basically the same, but as with any decent second album, fuller and more developed, like \"Live Those Days Tonight\".

{"text":"Dusted Features\n\nDestined: Deerhunter\n\n\"I think awkwardness is our one and only engaging quality.\" This comes from Bradford Cox, the front man of Atlanta five-piece Deerhunter.\n\nCryptograms, the band's second LP, will be released by Kranky on January 29. Something about it feels anomalous in the context of both the mellow, mildly academic label's back catalog and indie music generally, and this is exciting. While there are few unprocessed sounds on the album's 12 tracks, it's thoroughly rooted in pop \u2013 more importantly, it engages with pop in a broad way rarely heard since we began to create a genre definition for indie. It's pop that lives in symbiosis with feedback and structures songs around mistakes.\n\nIt might be easier to suggest an influence from Brian Eno's pop records and The Jesus & Mary Chain \u2013 both of which are pretty surface-level and avowed by the band \u2013 but it would also be absurdly incomplete. Getting at what Cryptograms actually feels like calls up a haunted house version of high school (this is how Cox describes the novel Closer by his favorite writer, Dennis Cooper) and swimming in strangers' pools at night. You know, teenage suburban boy things.\n\nCox's diet-of-Butterfingers and holey Chucks vibe belies the intensity with which he pursues songwriting. \"Lockett [Pundt, guitar] and I have been playing together since whenever,\" he says. \"I started doing 4-track stuff on my own in high school, and it's still how I write music. It's random. I don't usually work on just one song, but instead I record eight songs in like 20 minutes, and then sort out what's worth keeping later. All of my energy goes into recording songs, so I have like 12 new songs to bring to the band each week.\"\n\nIt's incredible, then, that the band's untitled debut record was released in 2004. Cox describes it as a \"premature statement,\" and it took the band a year to get back into the studio to begin recording Cryptograms. The initial sessions yielded nothing, and Cox remembers himself \"freaking out. I was completely emotionally and physically wasted. I'd sit down in front of the piano and roll the tape and just play a really sparse plinky thing and then everyone would just be like 'what the fuck are we supposed to play over that?' It was terrible. I had not learned to detach and keep big pictures in mind.\"\n\nUpon returning to the same studio in rural Georgia that had been the site of the initial meltdown, the band recorded Cryptograms in two days. Cox explains his approach to recording in a way that partially explains why the band's 'mature' statement took two attempts: \"What I basically do is set everything up, like create tension or push things in a certain direction and then bitch everyone out when it doesn't turn out that way. I'm kind of like a pretentious middle-school Eno wannabe in that sense.\"\n\nDespite this, using \"front man\" to describe Cox is an uncomfortable fit. Cryptograms oscillates between pop patterns and drones on something like a song-to-song basis. The transition from \"Red Ink\" (a slowly eddying drone drawing on Cox's voice and accordion and bell playing, with treatments by drummer Moses Archuleta) to a four-song stretch of the album's poppiest songs feels like a serious negotiation between sensibilities.\n\nDespite the give-and-take that marks the album's flow, the weirdly archaic title of \"front man\" may be the only designation that works. Cox's appearance is the focus of their polarizing performances (see the \"actual testimony\" from Deerhunter show attendees posted on their MySpace page for anecdotes about Cox's pink slip-clad antics), while his voice, and multi-instrumental interventions are the focus of their recordings.\n\n\"I don't write all of the music,\" Cox explains, \"but I control the final output.\" Archuleta, Josh Fauver, Colin Mee, and Pundt play everything from synth pads to Hammond organ on the album, but are primarily responsible for drums, bass, and guitars, respectively.\n\nCox seems amused rather than put out by what people tend to read into Deerhunter. A lot of people, he says, \"think we're like hipster vegans, which is really funny to me. That, or they assume I'm a heroin addict just from how I look. People I know that are junkies never get that.\"\n\nSimilarly, attempts at parsing them musically through the influences we ascribe them fall short. Deerhunter's a band that has its Loveless moments but mostly has this long-limbed musical intelligence that draws things together in an uncomfortably satisfying way. Kind of like a big skateboarding bruise on your hip that turns a new color each day and whose throbbing is a pleasant distraction from Geography class or whatever.\n\n\"I'm really into people who invented their own languages, people who had nothing they were mimicking aesthetically,\" says Cox. The artists he admires most are those who, \"like Wu-Tang or The Velvet Underground or Dead C or Suicide\u2026might be used in a class on 'How Not To Be Successful.'\"\n\nThough the band's sounds are mostly mediated by effects pedals and treatments, even the disorienting, untraceable sounds of an ambient track like \"White Ink\" are collaged carefully and spontaneously enough to prepare the space needed for the kraut-footed stomp of \"Lake Somerset.\" \"There are times when our music takes on this clarity,\" Cox says, \"and there are even times when it becomes something totally pop and not at all clouded, but that's what you get when you are in a group of people collaborating on a sound. I, personally, am much more moved by the crackle and hiss and the lulling nature of like heavy fuzz. Like The Jesus and Mary Chain, it's just white noise layered over Shangri-La's songs.\"\n\nThere's a certain kind of classicism at work throughout Cryptograms. While they're not copying the masters, Deerhunter is far from trying to be the vanguard. It's indicative of the openness of the musical climate in 2007 that we can talk about \"folk\" without the qualifier \"freak\" and that rock bands no longer need token no-wave gestures to avoid irony. While those in the criticism camps might be more and more receptive to Deerhunter's approach as the year progresses, the band still feel like outcasts in their hometown (though they have a close relationship to The Black Lips) and seem to frequently bum out audiences, not least on a recent tour with Yeah Yeah Yeahs.\n\n\"Somebody said to me recently that we were like the Todd Solondz of garage rock,\" Cox says. \"We're always controversial, whether we intend to be or not. I've always noticed how polarized kids are with us: they either freak out and come up to me and talk about taking ecstasy in a Ford Taurus with their best friend and want to know all this stuff about the effects pedals we use or they write us death threats.\"\n\nThis is perfectly fine with Cox, and it's a reaction he seems to court. He says indie culture is nothing more than \"a bunch of attractive straight people patting themselves on the back about how 'open-minded' they are\" but digs equally into the alienating machismo of CD-R noise dude culture. \"I just don't relate to that shit at all,\" Cox says, \"I just don't think it's productive energy. A thousand bands that sound exactly alike. I feel like I'm constantly trying to posture myself against this image of indie liberal socialist queer-friendly environmental yadda yadda.\"\n\nCox's beef is with eliteism rather than any specific subculture. And, as endearing and refreshing as their awkwardness is in the face of clinical, effective indie bands that communicate not affect but rather the idea of having feelings, Cox recognizes the limitations of the approach: \"The thing about that awkwardness is it prevents us from achieving what we're really aiming for sonically and aesthetically from even enjoying the kind of social side of it.\"\n\nDeerhunter have given themselves a lot of room to flesh out their lanky frames on Cryptograms. If the dosage of panic-driven, propulsive ambient jams on the album is any indication, outgrowing their awkwardness will be a pretty great thing. The band's plans for 2007 include trying to play more shows to spread out the songs from Cryptograms and upcoming releases a little more. Cox also wants \"to teach the band a bunch of new songs I've got. I have like 12 albums written; I have literally hundreds of tapes lying around. I want to do a new record very soon after this one.\""}

And stopping by to feed Louie has made him late for our interview, but it's the kind of responsibility that he feels all right shirking a press commitment for. \"Even though it's only been since August, it's totally changed the way I look at my life,\" says Solomon, who shares singing, songwriting and guitar duties with Adam Switlick in FLT, along with bassist Steve Murray and drummer Matt O'Laughlin. \"I mean, that's why I got the dog; I want to come home and know that I'm responsible enough. I mean, I still fuck up. But it's totally changed my mentality about the band and what I'm doing.\"\n\nWhat\nhe's talking about is rehab, but this isn't a salvation story or\na sob story. Life knocks you around sometimes, and if you're lucky, you\nget back up. Solomon's been singing about down-and-outers long enough\nto see the irony in his own story. Friends Like These make music that's\nmore than the sum of its parts, seeing as how it's mostly one half rock,\none half roll. It's swaggering and self-assured stuff layered over with\na slinky, dirty and sloppy veneer. Solomon and his band have been on the verge\nof breaking out for a while now, and so I was a little surprised to get an e-mail\nfrom him explaining that a company had bought the friendslikethesemusic.com\ndomain name while he was in treatment.

We're\nall about the rock clich\u00e9s minus all the trappings of success.\"\nHow do you become a rock clich\u00e9?\n\n\"Bandwise, shit was going really well,\" Solomon begins. \"We\nhad just put out the [Deliver Us from Evil] EP over the summer, and that\nwas doing really well.

Especially\nhere in the Twin Cities, everyone plays in everyone else's band and these\nkinds of conflicts happen all the time. As for waiting for the big break, it's\npretty much the standard M.O. for anyone who's ever picked up a guitar,\nand when you've been buzzing as hard as FLT for as long as they have,\nthe build-up mounts almost unbearably, with good money being thrown after bad\nand stock taken in the belief that all you need is the right person to hear\nyou. \"O'Laughlin then said he was gonna quit the band,\" Solomon\ncontinues, \"and join the Hopefuls. Then we had to audition new drummers\nand that makes any band rethink what they're doing and that's when\nI started. At the same time, my wife had left for grad school and so I was living\nalone and I started getting into drugs. And our album was done. It's been\nat the same point for a fucking year. It's just been sitting there and\nwe don't have the money to finish it.\"\n\nThere's a special kind of frustration that comes along with having something\nyou love stymied. The collective faith that goes along with pulling together\nto take over the world is delicate; when those bonds fray, they're hard\nto repair. After Eric Fawcett took his place in the Hopefuls, O'Laughlin\nreturned to FLT, but things had changed. \"By that time I was fully involved\nin drugs,\" Solomon says, \"and I was always the guy who pushed the\nband and made decisions, talked to the labels and got us on tour. And then I\nactually became homeless for a while because my wife came back and kicked me\nout.\" He couch-surfed through the bulk of the summer, squatted in an unrented\napartment and even spent a few nights sleeping in his car. \"Then everything\nkind of came to a head at the end of summer when Adam [Switlick] finally threw\nme in his car and fucking screamed at me. It was after I played a show at the\nHexagon\u2014the Elliott Smith Tribute night\u2014and I was yelling at the\nHexagon staff while I was onstage. So this whole year went by where we faked\nlike we were doing something.\"\n\nHe\ncontinued going to his job every day, but only after \"waking up in the\nmorning and shooting a half-pint of vodka so [he] could stop [his] hands from\nshaking.\" He was a regular speed user, sold his guitars and after someone\nbroke into his car and stole his jeans, he sold that. So Solomon went out to\nSan Diego for treatment, discovering along the way that he's bi-polar.\nIt's changed his life, but he's hesitant to talk about it since\nso many of his friends have fallen further and worked harder to pull themselves\nup. But I'm just glad he's still making music and that Friends Like\nThese are back. Maybe not all the way yet, but they're getting there.\n\"We're still trying to work it out,\" explains Solomon. \"Adam\nand I have gotten into a lot of fights lately. It's tough because I see\nit like siblings fighting because we've been together for so long.\"\n\nThere are a lot of metaphors people use for bands: brothers, a family, a marriage.\nBut in a band there's a complicated dynamic because these are people with\nwhom you are deeply connected through music, but that very connection can sometimes\nmake it difficult to just talk to them like regular people. It's more\nlike someone you went all the way with too soon. And when you play in lots of\ndifferent groups, it gets hairy.\n\n\"But I don't feel bad at all,\" says Solomon about everyone's\ninvolvement with other groups, \"because our new mentality is if somebody's\nnot handing you a gold Rolex, you're gonna be around town for a while.\nWe were all OK with each other doing our own thing, and we realized that we\nget along way better with each other than we do with any of the other bands\nwe've played in. Like last night we had a rehearsal and\u2014we're\ntotal dorks\u2014we ended up shutting off the lights in the room and playing\n40 minutes of just loud noise. I've been with those guys so long, I know\nwhat O'Laughlin's gonna do, I can feel where he's gonna break\ndown, where Steve is gonna break down. And all the side projects: the more you\ndabble in them, the more you realize who you work with.\"\n\nOne of the illusions most cherished by filmmakers is that all the hard times\ncan dissolve away in a slow-mo shot of a tender embrace, that the degringolade\nof your life can be turned around in a moment. It's not often that you\nsee what happens in the months that follow a critical turning point, but that's\njust where Solomon finds himself these days. It's all a work in progress,\nbut now that Friends Like These are back full-time, hopefully he can go back\nto just singing about the dissolute lifestyle, and not living it. ||"}

{"text":"\u00bb Shrines\n\nWhat would have happened to the show Lost if it weren't for DVRs? The unique facet of Lost was that it was truly a product of its time; had we not been able to fast-forward, pause, and obsessively re-watch episodes to find secret images and connections, the beauty and coherence of the show, the essential mystery, would have been, eponymously, lost.\n\nIn the context of DVRs, as well as music's modern trends of amplified bass and a rampant disregard for the confines of genre, Purity Ring's debut album Shrines makes perfect sense.\n\nAfter spending the summer immersing myself in new releases, my experience with Shrines was surprisingly memorable. Sadly, the overwhelming volume of fantastic new music I wanted to listen to this summer left me little time to revisit any album, especially one that did not immediately strike me as especially significant or interesting.\n\nIt's rare for a band to take a path as slow as the one that Purity Ring has traveled. Releasing five singles at an excruciatingly slow pace over the course of a year was both frustrating and hard to take your eyes (ears?) off of. They describe their music as \"Future Pop\", which is fitting because they've been my #1 band-crush since \"Ungirthed\" was released at the beginning of 2011, and it looks like they're going to stay at the top of the list for a long time."}

{"text":"In The Studio: Set It Off\n\nAfter several stints on Warped Tour and the re-release of their Horrible Kids EP, Set It Off are currently finishing up their debut full-length for Equal Vision in Alpharetta, Georgia, with pop-punk masterminds Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount. AP had the chance to chat with frontman Cody Carson about the heavier sounds they're coming up with, anxiety attacks in a movie theater and balancing the selfishness of musicianship with the selflessness of relating to your fans.\n\nYou guys chose to record with Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount this time around. What was behind this decision?\nHonestly, we were huge fans of past albums they've [worked on], such as [Mayday Parade's] A Lesson In Romantics and Cartel's Chroma. Their discography is [focused on] more of a poppy sound and the tones that they would get on those albums we thought were incredible. They never seemed like they did a band that was as heavy as our new stuff, so we got really excited about the concept of, \"What if they had those tones with our sound?\"\n\nHow is the relationship going? How is working with them on a musical level?\nIt's incredible. The chemistry is amazing. When we got there, we immediately clicked, like we're good friends. Then, as far as working together on songs goes, it's like they know exactly what we're going for. What's important to us is making sure that on every song, you can feel 100 percent of exactly what we mean. They're really good at helping us cultivate that in the songs, so I'm really excited about that.\n\nHow many songs did you bring into the studio?\nWe came into the studio with 18 full songs and about 6 or 7 song concepts. At first, we thought we were just doing 10 songs\u2014that was the goal. Then we did and we're like, \"Damnit, there's one more song that we want to have on this album.\" So we asked [our label] and [because Equal Vision Records] is amazing, we are going to be releasing 11 songs. It was quite the process narrowing down those songs; they're like our children.\n\nYeah, that can be a really daunting process. How did the narrowing process go when you have that many songs on your plate?\nEach person loves each song for a different reason. Maybe there's a story in the song that's really close to their heart, or maybe there's a part that they can't wait to play live. When we got there, Zack [Odom] and Kenneth [Mount] would sit down with us and listen to all the songs with us. If there was a song where they were like, \"Okay, this is good, but what if this chorus was different?\" then Dan and I would immediately go into a live room with a guitar, and we would just write a new chorus right away and bring it back in there.\n\nAfter we would do that, we would have to go back and listen to the songs. We made a list, and we had to figure out which song is serving which purpose on the album. Do we have a song that'll take people on an emotional ride? Do we have a song that's really energetic and in-your-face? One thing that's really important about a full-length, that not everyone pays attention to while they're in the studio, is diversity. A lot of people will release an album and have every song sound like, \"Yes, that's their band,\" but they don't necessarily have songs that take you on a whole ride. That's what we're really focusing on. If people are going to buy our album, we want to make sure that people are going to feel like they're hearing an entire story or sitting down for a movie.\n\nSince you guys are pretty far in the recording process\u2014how is everything sounding? What are you most excited about?\n[Last week], I finished lead vocals. Right now, all we have left to do is lead guitars and harmonies. Strings are pretty much done\u2014that's what we were doing [the week before last]. I was writing a lot of strings and whatnot and putting it on top of the songs. Every night, they leave the studio unlocked for us, and we're so excited that we'll just go in there and listen to what we have so far. We were very proud of Horrible Kids, but this album is just a different level, and we're very, very excited about it. I just want to release it now, but we can't.\n\nYou had noted earlier that the new stuff is heavier. In what specific way?\nI should be careful when wording that. It's not that we're a metal band now, or \"screamo,\" but what is true to us is that if you heard our old songs, there was a bit of heaviness to that. What's really present on this album\u2026 we're very theatrical when we present our story. If it's a darker subject, there is a lot of angst and neurosis that goes into that song\u2014 and that, I feel, could be translated as heavier because of the fact it's not necessarily the same sounding. In fact, in one song, Zach and Ken think I sound like the Joker from The Dark Knight. Not that I'm going for that, I just really try to get into character for each song as far as the mood goes. It has that diversity, but it still sounds like Set It Off.\n\nYeah, that type of diversity is good for a band. What are you trying to do this time around\u2014sonically\u2014to not repeat yourself? Where are you headed in your overall sound to keep it fresh for yourself and the fans?\nWhen I was younger, growing up listening to Fall Out Boy, I would totally think that they planned it out like, \"Okay, next album we're going to do this.\" With this album, it showed me that it just happens. I didn't try to write anything different with this album; I just wrote what means a lot to me, and it starts naturally changing.\n\nAs far as differences from Horrible Kids, string-wise\u2014that defines what we are. We have a classical background and we like adding that theatricality to the songs, but with this album, if you took away the strings, they're still good songs. We add the strings in to give a whole different vibe to it. I think that's one thing I really like about this album. The strings are necessary, but if you took them away for an acoustic show, you'd still get the full enjoyment out of that song.\n\nHow are you approaching lyrics and the themes of this record? What are you trying to cover this time around?\nBasically, what's really important to me is that I never want to write a song I don't really believe in. There'll be songs where someone will do a co-write and the song means nothing to them. What's important to me is that, if I was younger or whatever age, I want to be able to reach anybody that's been in the situation.\n\nAn example is like an anxiety attack. When I was growing up, I had a really terrible anxiety attack in a movie theater. I remember I was sitting in a chair in the movie theater and I thought\u2014for no reason at all\u2014that one of my family members was hurt. I got up and started walking down the stairs to exit the movie theater, I got tunnel vision and my skin turned cold. I ran outside and I fell on the ground and I screamed for help. I'll never forget that in my entire life. As I went on through life, I realized I wasn't alone for having a moment like that. Anxiety attacks are super-common. It's unfortunate, but it's actually completely normal, so I wrote a song to reach out to people who have been through that.\n\nEvery now and then I'll tweet, \"What are you going through right now? What is the toughest thing you've had to deal with?\" and I really got a lot of feedback on that, so I was like, \"Okay, how can I tie this into the things I've been through?\" People go through rough patches and have shitty days. We wanted to have music that will cheer you up and give you hope at putting you through some real situations.\n\nThat's a noble cause to fight for, and it's really cool you take the time to send a tweet and shape yourself around that to help yourself relate to your fans.\nI think it's really cool. What really means a lot to us is that every now and then we'll get a Tumblr \"ask\" or something that's like, \"Thank you guys, because I was considering suicide and now I'm okay.\" Those kinds of messages are the reason why I keep pushing for that cause.\n\nThere's nothing better you can do as a musician than bridge that gap between the selfishness of art and the selflessness of being there for and relating to your fans--wanting to be there for the people who listen to your music.\nYeah, I'll write songs to help someone out, but I'll never go, \"Oh, here's all the terrible things about it.\" I'll always have that aspect of the song that cheers you up and the songs are extremely upbeat. What's also is important is that I don't want people to think this album is some depressing album\u2014by no means is it. And this album is going to be so fun to play live. alt"}
{"text":"Words, Entertainment, Music & Brighton.\n\nMenu\n\nArtist Feature: Stone Sun\n\nThe best way to describe the sound of local Brighton band Stone Sun is with some big, dramatic, Hollywood style visual metaphor. Bear with me on this. I need you to concentrate. Stone Sun is their name, and I want you to work from that, imagining scorched desert sand in Nevada, somewhere outside Las Vegas. The occasional large rock is dotted around the landscape, but watch out, because this is bat country.\n\nIn the distance through the mirage you catch sight of a lone motor vehicle cruising through the heat, making its way across the arid landscape towards you. Don't worry though; it's still far off in the distance right now, driven by a lone figure. The breeze brings you the distant sound of Rock 'n' Roll. The song has taken on a unique tonality telling you that the driver of the car is playing his music loud.\n\nWithout warning, the camera cuts to right next to the open top car, placing you inside the noise blasting from the car's speakers, distorting the air around them as they frantically push out bar after bar of human emotion. Pushed to their maximum capacity, they add an extra layer of distortion to an already ferocious sound.\n\nThat's the closest I can get you to Stone Sun's sound live.\n\nI saw the band perform on a Sunday at The Hope, a small venue for a band with a sound like this. Their sound is full-bodied grunge, with an appreciation of the more subtle dynamics required offset against the potency of a truly beasty riff. At their most powerful, you hear snatches of influences in bands like Smashing Pumpkins or Pearl Jam but these moments contrast with the technical proficiency of bands like Incubus.\n\nTake their song \"Memories\" for instance. It somehow manages to remind you of moments sitting with your Dad, or perhaps a more elderly relative, in his workshop, the sound of hard rock reproduced via a small, tinny radio. The song suddenly twists; it speeds up and takes on an altogether different connotation of something like anger, or intense sadness. The mental image becomes that time when you were left standing alone as a teenager. At the last moment the song twists again, this time into a euphoric guitar solo reaching a peak and pushing the energy level in the room up over the edge for the final chorus.\n\nOne of my pet peeves with local bands is throwing in different time signatures just because you can. When you turn around and realise all your songs are in 4\/4, that doesn't mean you suddenly have to write one in 6\/8 just because you can. Stone Sun have matured past using time signature changes as toys, and use the different pulses throughout one song to take the listener on their own musical journey, leaving your head bursting with imagery as you're lead on an exploration of songwriter Ricky Gallimore's inner feelings and desires.\n\nThe crowd at any gig on a Sunday can be hit or miss. A Sunday drinker doesn't care about Monday. A Sunday drinker could be a stiff figure, hunched over their drink, staring into the lonely chasm of their glass, or be a hardcore party animal, determined to spend their time on the planet enjoying life and ignoring the pain in their liver. Any band playing on a Sunday has to be prepared to draw people's attention away from issues of work, play and memory destruction and into the music. The crowd that evening seemed to be a mixture of friends and genuine fans, there to enjoy the explosive music.\n\nStone Sun ultimately engage the audience; they go through all the magical lost moments in rock and bring them back to the surface together. The feeling behind their songs is undeniable when you watch the band live, the passion fires out of them in all directions. Their live set is a furious drive at full speed through a singed, discoloured landscape, populated by memories of your past you didn't realise music could evoke. Until now."}

I've recently learned that it's an American thing to cordon off 'horniness\/lust' only into the sexual realm. In Germanic cultures, like where MO is from, and Southeast Asia, it can mean looking at life with a 'cool or exciting eye.'\n\nThis song perfectly captures that complex concept and gives it so many layers that you'll need more than one listen to discover them all.

(I didn't get to hear the trio live until a year and a half later, also in a church, in Berkeley).\n\nI was curious what would be present in the pared-down trio.

Japan's jerky pop style still remains on \"Pulling Punches\", but elsewhere the sound is a combination of laid-back jazz-inflected songs and sophisticated harmonies and instrumentation. The jazz emerges particularly in the trumpet solo of \"Nostalgia\" and the piano backing to \"Red Guitar\". \"Backwaters\" has a sinuous fretless bassline, while Jon Hassell's distinctive soft muted trumpet enhances the atmospheres of \"Weathered Wall\" and \"Brilliant Trees\". The title track is the album's high point, showcasing that style of silky baritone vocals over shifting ambient backings that would be a major feature of Sylvian's future solo work."}

{"text":"The Decemberists Return from a Prog-Rock Wasteland\n\nTo be a fan of the Decemberists, you have to be prepared to face an inevitable question: \"Why?\" There's something about the group that really pisses off a lot of people, from the music they play, to the words they use, to the way they look. Maybe folks are still confusing frontman Colin Meloy with Ben Gibbard, maybe everyone just needs a band to hate until Coldplay's next album, or maybe they've just come to stand for everything that's supposedly so boring about indie rock. After the 2009 release of The Hazards of Love, answering the question became much more difficult. It was a concept album with mostly crappy execution, all prog and no pulse. Luckily, the band's new album, The King is Dead, released on Capitol Records, is a return to what made the band so easy to defend in the first place\u2014largely thanks to R.E.M. Meloy has never been shy about his influences. He's recorded EPs dedicated to Morrissey, Sam Cooke, and Shirley Collins, and written a 33 1\/3 book on the Replacements' Let It Be, after all. But only now is he letting them show.\n\nAlbum opener \"Don't Carry It All\" and first single \"Down by the Water,\" featuring the always-lovely vocals of Gillian Welch, could easily be mistaken for Tom Petty's \"You Don't Know How It Feels\" or Springsteen's \"The Promised Land,\" with a touch of Harvest-era Neil Young thrown in as well. Meloy has also admitted that he was inspired by R.E.M. while recording King (I've often thought that if the Decemberists could go back in time, they'd choose 1992, so they could record Automatic for the People before Stipe, Mills, Buck, and Berry), and that band's imprint is all over the place, from the Murmur sounding \"Calamity Hymn,\" to the fact that Peter Buck actually plays on the album. Does it still count as ripping someone off when you just get the person you're ripping off to play the song for you?\n\nI don't mention these influences to discredit the album, though; in fact, it's probably the band's second best, after 2005's Picaresque. I mention them because it's nice to hear R.E.M. rather than Rush, Petty instead of preludes. For every highlight of Hazards (\"Annan Water\"), there were two songs that wouldn't have made the sixth disc of Joanna Newsom's Have One on Me. On King, there's practically nothing in the way of electric guitar solos or stories about pregnant fairies (or whatever), but instead the welcome return of Jenny Conlee's accordion, Nate Query's upright bass, John Moen's complimentary drumming, and Chris Funk's slide guitar playing. There's even some banjo thrown in there (\"All Arise!\"). They sound tight and together throughout, rather than absentmindedly preparing for every song's big climax like they were last time out.\n\nBut the Decemberists' best asset is still Meloy's voice. That was the most disappointing thing about Hazards: his soaring vocals were so often drowned out by the music that the playfulness of his words went unappreciated. But even on King's weakest song, \"This Is Why We Fight,\" Meloy, now back at the front of the mix, sounds energized in a way that he hasn't in a while.\n\nEvery song on King presents a different justification for either loving or hating the Decemberists. \"Rox in the Box\" continues the band's fine tradition of songs involving water (\"Get the rocks in the box\/Get the water right down to your socks\") and death (\"There's plenty of men to die, you don't jump your turn\"), while \"January Hymn,\" which has the same melody of Wilco's \"Bob Dylan's Beard), tells a relatively straightforward story about a long lost love, but with gorgeous imagery: \"On a winter's Sunday I go\/To clear away the snow\/And green the ground below\" would put even Dylan (and his beard) to shame.\n\nThe album's highlight is \"June Hymn,\" which is either the perfect song to fall asleep or wake up to. It begins with a harmonica and some simple guitar playing, and over the course of four minutes, Meloy describes a summer's day spent among jasmine and yellow bonnets. It's the musical accompaniment to the album's cover art. The King is Dead is a perfectly comfortable and relaxing album. No one song is as good as \"On the Bus Mall,\" the band's greatest triumph, but none are as bad as \"The Perfect Crime #2,\" either. After the last two albums, the Decemberists needed to scale back, and that's exactly what they did. It's the album they needed to make. And it's the album some of us needed to hear."}

{"text":"REVIEWSMilagres, 'Glowing Mouth'\n\nMilagres singer Kyle Wilson does not move idly. Stricken with writer's block a few years back, the Brooklyn native fled to Canada, where he promptly injured his back rock climbing. He wrote his psych-pop quintet's second album while bedridden, fulfilling the wanderlust his accident cut short by indulging in languid chamber-pop piano (\"Doubted\") and falsetto funk-lite grooves (the title track). Yet Glowing Mouth's general disillusionment anchors its sprawl: Wayfarer anthem \"Here to Stay\" depicts a Walden-esque oasis of bucolic hills and lilting birds outside, but when Wilson throws open the shutters, no light shines through."}
{"text":"Attendees\n\nIn Brixton's uncomfortable and dimly lit Windmill (though everyone always says how much they love it, I can't see it), the worn d\u00e9cor and fuzzy regular clientele seems somewhat disparate to the excess of twee on display this evening. And don't start getting all upset because I used the word twee. It's not derogatory.\n\nPocketbooks are just about the most disorganised and under-rehearsed band one might pay money to see. And not in the charming 'actually our songs are really good so it doesn't matter we can't play them' sort of way. They're just silly, really. There's nothing offensive about their Gorky's meets Tallulah Gosh whimsy-pop, it's just close to impossible to make a fair judgement when they don't know their own songs. They might be amazing, I just can't tell. Ah well, maybe I'm a stick-in-the-mud\u2026\n\nStars Of Aviation, however, are comparative professionals (not that that's an issue for the assembled twee folk). Their vaguely Canadian (and not just because the guitarist looks every single member of the Arcade Fire mixed with a geography teacher) sound is as tuneful as it is texturally bracing and adventurous, delicately wandering between the twinkling melancholy of Adem and something much more likely to make you actually feel an emotion. Every song they play this evening sparkles with a wit reminiscent of a much more agreeable Luke Haines, whilst retaining some wonderful timbral shifts as the accordion and keyboard merge to form a counterpoint to the punching trumpet melodies. Beautiful.\n\nBut then, cripes, things get a bit fraught. Everyone seems to be hell-bent on getting to the front for Butcher Boy. There's been the odd sprinkling of hype around London about this band thanks to favourable inclusion on the How Does It Feel To Be Loved? label compilation, but their single isn't out until two days after this show. How have so many people heard good things about this band? Is it just word of mouth and the sheer power of genial PR? No matter. The point is that people are genuinely excited about the songs written by John Blain Hunt of Butcher Boy and their humorously depressing overtones.\n\nDespite this, things do start somewhat shakily. Songs struggle to find their own choruses, they finish before they get started and leave the ears confused. But then, thank Christ, they play 'Girls Make Me Sick', that single that no-one's supposed to have heard yet. And it's ace, beautifully sad and vibrant with string swells aplenty and the good sense not to hang around any longer than necessary. That's pop know-how. After that, every song they play suddenly becomes wonderfully dour and weirdly loveable, fizzing anthems to sobbing sadness and pity shot through with Motown panache and the homespun charm of Belle & Sebastian. One wonders why this couldn't have been the case from the beginning. But then again, it's early days for Butcher Boy. We will be watching closely."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, a trend will sweep through a genre and become completely inescapable. Trap music has taken over mainstream rap in recent years, combining droning bass, skittering hi-hats, and aggressive boasting into an oddly hypnotic package.\n\nIt's the type of music you hear blaring from passing cars but all that you can really hear is the bass.\n\nSZA is using the foundation of trap music to make shimmering R&B with conceptually bizarre lyrics. It's trap music with the platinum chains replaced by flower anklets. It's less about dealing coke and more about sharing a bong at a tie-dye love-in.\n\nS could have just been an interesting novelty, but SZA herself makes it memorable as something more than that. Her vocals are drenched in echo and reverb, and while she can definitely sing well, her vocals are mostly kept light. She could overpower the songs if she really wanted to, but chooses to complement the production instead.\n\nThis turns out to be a great idea, because the combination of heavy bass and New Age music makes the songs bounce back and forth between club music and lullabies. It's not the type of music that will get you to tear the club up or beat down someone who just stepped on your shoes, even though it sounds like it was produced by the very same aggressive beatsmiths.\n\nThe lyrics of the songs are strange, but they manage to be fitting for such an odd musical mashup. \"I am not human \/ I am made of bacon\" isn't a deep lyrical statement, and \"Feeling like Topanga, Patti Mayonnaise\" is great if you liked Boy Meets World and Doug, but is out of context even within the song. The lyrics are nearly incomprehensible but they fit into the atmosphere of the songs perfectly.\n\nS is less than 30 minutes long, but its brief length seems intentional, as if it's merely a part of a larger project. It wastes a little too much time with skits and the song \"Wings\" is weak, but this EP is worth a listen. It could be the only album in recent memory that would appeal to hippies, hip-hop heads and anyone else who likes blasting music out of their car windows."}

{"text":"A Big Night Out at... a Central London Indie Disco!\n\nBack when I was a wee slip of a lad, when I had only just cobbled together enough money to buy myself a fake \"European Driving Permit\" I found on Ask Jeeves, the places to be were not the souped-up pool halls and tropical basement bars of East London, but the midweek indie discos of the West End.\n\nYou'd hear stories about men who went to a different one of these clubs every night. Near-mythical winklepickered lotharios who tore up the sticky dancefloors to the pulsating sounds of the first Rakes album, embroiled in their own, feverish delusions of bildungsroman when really they all lived with their parents in Streatham and worked off their hangovers in retail admin departments. But they didn't care, for those four nights a week they were superstars. To an impressionable 16-year-old, these men were gods, and I worshipped in the shadow of their nascent lager bellies tiring of life the dark side of the drainpipe waistband.\n\nEventually I and everybody I knew moved on, and the London indie dream died in tandem with Pete Doherty's transformation from Oliver to Fagin. But I've always wondered what became of these places, and the people I kissed, embraced and glassed to \"Mr Brightside\" as the lights came up. So for one night only, I decided to line my stomach, fire up the Oyster and remember to bring my passport. I was going home.\n\nThe venue for the night's proceedings would be a joint called Moonlighting in the heart of Soho and its notorious Wednesday night watered-down-vodka orgy, Cheapskates. When I told people that day where I would be spending the evening, everyone talked about it in the same way old sailors talk about navigating treacherous passages.\n\nIn case you were wondering, the night ain't called Cheapskates for nothing. It's not some plush Mayfair nightclub sarcastically giving itself a downmarket name as some kind of lame society in-joke, like Tramp or Punk. The night is called Cheapskates because it's really fucking cheap.\n\nThe whole place is decked out like Peter Stringfellow's kitchen, clad with mirrors you can see your nosehairs in and Vice City-style neon lights. It might seem at first as though it's trying to be kitsch, like some kind of 80s-themed bar in the adult section at Disneyland. But I can assure you that it isn't; the owners of Moonlighting really do think that a pink neon Martini glass is a sophisticated touch.\n\nOne thing you learn about a place like this is that you're always going to arrive too early. These two decided to hit the ground dancing, no doubt spurred on by an afternoon's worth of pre-drinking, leaving their uni halls only after they'd maxed out their Spotify play allowance on a disorientating, looped combo of Major Lazer's \"Hold Yuh\" remix and \"Cigarettes & Alcohol\".\n\nSlowly but surely, the punters began to trickle in. Think the guys on the right look lonely? Nah man, these guys were pros. Scoping the joint out and sinking a few brewskis before the honeys starting rolling in. If there's one thing you should have learnt from rap videos, it's that real Gs aren't afraid to hit the designated seating area.\n\nI'm not entirely sure who this old guy is, but he's been sitting in that exact same spot every time I've been to this place (which is more times than I care to admit). The romantic in me likes to think he owns the joint, staring into the distance remembering a shot girl he fell in love with once. But the sad likelihood is he's just some boozy old pervert the staff have learnt to tolerate over the years.\n\nIt was at this point that I began to realise Cheapskates wasn't really an indie night any more. I felt like a man who'd been released from a ten-stretch at Wormwood Scrubs and returned to his hometown pub only to find that it'd been replaced by a branch of AllSaints. I wandered around searching for just one trilby, or a pair of braces, but all I found was chinos and hair extensions.\n\nThese girls ran over to us when they saw we had a camera that wasn't part of a phone and started doing this. I'm not entirely sure why. It's a horrible feeling when people who seem nice think you're an official club photographer who's going to immortalise their youths forever in the \"party moment\". Sorry, girls.\n\nEven if I wasn't a fan of some of the DJs' selections, I had to hand it to them for their eclecticism alone. They seemed to go through just about every genre of music during the course of the night. There aren't many places in London you can go to and hear Skrillex and The Long Blondes played back-to-back.\n\nMetallers are usually a bit neglected at most club nights, condemned to standing at the bar pretending to appreciate Lil Wayne's snare drum sound whilst they order another Snakebite. But not so at Cheapskates. This hellian was chuffed to bits when the good men on the wheels of steel dropped a couple of tracks off the first Kreator album.\n\nBut no matter how much they tried, the DJs just couldn't shift our barfly from his stool. He sat there staring into his triple Southern Comfort and lemonade like a disco Bukowski. His endless melancholy doing its best to harsh the rest of our collective cray. Come on mate, they're playing \"Party Rock Anthem\"!\n\nIgnore mini-Arg and his rubber arms for just a second and let's hone in on the guy on the right. That jacket doesn't look tailored, does it? Does that mean that high street menswear shops are actually selling clothes that make you look like a pubescent schoolboy going through an awkward growth spurt now? Either way, his hotel bellboy steez made me wonder if I should be tipping him for something.\n\nAs if it wasn't already easy enough to get yourself a dose of alcohol poisoning here, they also employed this periphery booze vendor, who stood around juggling beers like an alcoholic street performer forced into juggling beer cans for tourists. His eyes seemed as hollow as a dancing bear's or a woman who gets boned every hour on loop in an Amsterdam sex show. But then, \u00a32 for a can is pretty good by today's prices.\n\nHey guys, you don't look like some kind of Swingers-style lothario tag team with your (almost) matching shirts. What you look like is spoilt French children who are dressed by their nanny. If variety is the spice of life, these guys are eating Korma.\n\nThis isn't the kind of place that commissions a pair of Camberwell art students to create some avant-garde \"video installation\". They just sort of had a couple of TVs going in case people got bored of rubbernecking at all the puking and groping going on. Thoughtful, really.\n\nCivilised people often use the phrase \"meat market\" to describe places like this, but Cheapskates isn't so much a meat market as it is a pile of rotting offcuts left behind the butcher's for foxes and the people from Occupy to fight over. Most of the guys were preening sleazebags in deck shoes and the girls succumbed to them with a tragic desperation. But it was this guy's cuntbands and the thought of his surfer past that really had me riding a wave of suffocating nausea.\n\nI don't know if these guys were actually Scottish and going for a kind of Ewan-McGregor-at-the-Oscar's-honouring-their-culture kind of flex, or if they were actually just English Uni Lads trying to get girls to grab their balls, but trainers and a kilt is not a good look. You end up looking more like Axl Rose in the height of his coke hell rather than Mel Gibson in Braveheart.\n\nIf love is the answer, what is the question? Probably something like \"What will I never find if I keep wearing kilts to nightclubs and hanging out with guys like this?\" Kudos to the guy in the glasses though, who is maybe the only Highlands Guido on earth.\n\nThe glamour factor increased significantly when Prince William turned up on the pull. Don't let K-Middy know about this young Camilla.\n\nAt this point, it became apparent that no matter how much of the vodka content was actually tap water, it could still send you home arm in arm with somebody in a high-vis jacket. It can also make you pull stupid, photo-ruining poses, as I'm expertly demonstrating in the foreground.\n\nEventually, the atmosphere began to sour. The explosive combination of ethanol and bro-step began to send the guys crazy, and they started behaving like dogs trying to warn us about an imminent hurricane. The bouncers went from bastards to heroes in a matter of minutes, bravely pulling people from the booze crush like firefighters at a Topshop 9\/11.\n\nThere's always someone who thinks that he's on some Kimbo Slice shit after a few plastic jars. Sadly, being captain of the UCL rugby team doesn't translate into fighting a trained professional who's as sober as a judge. If you look hard enough, you might be able to find some of his teeth next time you're there.\n\nEventually I made it out to the smoking area, not to smoke, but just to remind myself that was some humanity left in the world. I was planning to go back in for another round of cash and carry vodka, but then I saw these guys. And if there's one thing that will remind you it's a fucking Wednesday, it's binmen. They let us know that we have responsibilities, like waking up and going home. They are the cockerels of our conscience.\n\nMy sinuses hurt, my jumper smelt like a pub towel and I can still taste the flat cola in my mouth. Oh, Westminster; I tried to love you once, like the days we used to have, but alas, we've grown apart. I'm too old and too tired for this. I just want to sit on tables and wince every time I open my wallet at the bar. Maybe one day we'll see each other again, but it won't be in this lifetime. Cheapskates, you have killed me."}

{"text":"Search\n\nI'm quite aware that I'm so weird when it comes to music. I've got such diverse music taste, and it's not what most people would consider a good thing. In fact I like things that a lot of people would consider terrible, but a few people I know love. It's just strange that I can be so excited for new music like this and still like something like 65daysofstatic'sWe Were Exploding Anyway.\n\nBut I do. And let me say that We Were Exploding Anyway is definitely one of my favorite post-rock albums ever, after only a day of listening to it. Keep in mind that I'm not a huge post-rock listener, so that means almost literally nothing. Except you know how much I enjoy it, if my taste means anything to you. Which it probably doesn't, after this.\n\nI wouldn't call We Were Exploding Anyway a new direction for the band, but it's certainly the most electronic material I've ever heard from them. Opener \"Mountainhead\" may have you first checking if you accidentally put in Kid A for a second, but then moves in a completely original direction, blending the IDM glitch-noises with powerful bass, and then, just as suddenly, switching to a very danceable track that blends all of these elements together.\n\nYou can download \"Crash Tactics\" on their website if you have any doubts about whether or not you'll enjoy this album. It's the album's shortest track, and it plays with electronic insanity over frantic, driving guitars. The entire song is one insane crescendo of brilliance. Honestly, I can't describe. And you can get it for free, so why don't you just listen to it and experience how awesome it is?\n\n\"Dance Dance Dance\" is trancey and addictive, and \"Piano Fights\" starts with quiet piano, but builds into a behemoth that will numb your senses. \"Weak4\u2033 will pummel you into submission the way post-rock really isn't known for doing. But you won't have any doubt left afterwards.\n\nThey take full advantage of the addition of Robert Smith's voice on \"Come To Me\" to such ghostly, powerful effect. It, like most of what this band does, can't really be described using words. But the lyrics work so well here. Just more proof that 65dos would be just as good if they had a singer.\n\nThe fourteen-minute closer \"Tiger Girl\" feels like full Paul Oakenfold disco\u2026 until those drums come in. And then the guitars\u2026 it's an epic crescendo unlike any other, and then it slowly fades out without losing any intensity. That is EXACTLY what I want out of music.\n\nAnd god, that album cover. I don't know what it is about it, but it's probably one of my favorite album covers I've ever seen. It deserves to be looked at in higher quality. It's also my desktop wallpaper right now. There's something just so powerful about that pre-kiss moment, and the quality of the photograph is just so incredible. You can't look away. And the way they put the band name and album title in there is so simple, but still feels so effective. I love it.\n\nWhat more can I say? The album blows me away, and it grows on me with every listen. So in other words, listen to it right now. And look at that album cover. And be in awe of the sheer power of 65daysofstatic."}

{"text":"Ganglians - Sheffield\n\nGanglians are a difficult band to attach a label to. With their musical output now spanning three albums, their catalogue references many genres - spookily harmonised folk, psychedelic garage rock, and fuzzed-out tropical wig outs to name a few. Their influences range across a musical spectrum creating a varied and eclectic musical tapestry, which is displayed throughout their show tonight.\nDespite a relatively low turnout, the band don't seem at all fazed by this and go about their business with a healthy amount of aggression and intensity. The vocal and instrumental talent is evident from the off with the band creating tightly layered melodies that intertwine perfectly to create a dense patchwork of harmony and melody. The band are certainly advocates of using technical effects to elevate their sound, and tonight they take it to weirder and stranger heights than they appear to on their records. Like many bands that have crossed the Atlantic recently (especially from the Californian region), their songs are drenched in reverb, creating a sparse and open feel to their music. While other groups have sometimes used this effect to hide behind, Ganglians musical ability still shines through and is used tastefully, only being turned up to the maximum when neccessary.\n\nDuring songs like 'Drop The Act' and 'Hair', the band seem at their most aggressive as singer Ryan Grubb flails about with seemingly little control bashing his delay pedal. During the calmer parts of the set, like 'Jungle' and 'That's What I Want' the band appear a hallunicagenic Beach Boys, their music hypnotizing and transfixing the band and the audience alike.\n\nUnlike the band's recorded output, which can sometimes become repetitive and slightly grating, Ganglians' live show is encapsulating and alluring. The members of the band seem fully eclipsed in the music they are creating as they twist and writhe to each note. Front man, Grubb, plays with no shoes on, which he later tells me is so he can feel the vibrations of the music on stage, while bassist Adrian Comenzind holds an intense stare throughout, looking slightly chemically unbalanced but at the same time totally immersed in the dense layers of the sound. Ganglians add an extra dimension to their live show as they are able to deliver a more accute and seductive element of their music and create a powerful and memorable experience for anyone watching."}

{"text":"The Tough Question: How Do You Name Instrumental Songs, Joe Satriani?\n\nReally, how do you name any song? There are conventions in pop music (commercially driven, of course) where acts parrot the hook, the chorus, in the title. \"Umbrella, -ella, -ella\u2026\" Makes sense from a branding perspective, if not because the chorus is the most meaningful part of the narrative.\n\nOr you can follow experimental freaks (and, for some reason, emo bands) and conjure up something creepy or witty that isn't compact enough to fit into a couplet.\n\nThis sort of thing is good enough for instrumental post-rock bands too, but faux-profundity usually trumps self-satisfied quips. Enough classical music, evolving over hundreds of years, referred to the style and key of the music or the mythic literature that inspired it. So does much hifalutin vocal-free jazz. But it's fascinating to listen to a lyric-less song differently under the title 'Yinxianghechengqi' (by Chicago post-rockers Tortoise) or 'Wall Street' (by New York math-prog trio Battles).\n\nMelbourne instrumental post-rock band International Karate titled an album Weapons Of Mass Protection, which made them unlikely in that they were a band with no words but a political agenda, drummer Aaron Pepper shrugging to me during an interview \"apparently we're doing it through an album title.\"\n\nAnother mostly-instrumental Melbourne act Love Of Diagrams told me that titles tend to originate from wordplay and visual art. Guitarist Luke Horton said, \"They used to be called 'The Fast One' and 'The Slow One' until we'd write another fast one or slow one so we had to settle on something.\"\n\nTheir song 'Tiger Pancakes' was based on the pre-PC children's story Little Black Sambo about tigers chasing the protagonist around a palm tree faster and faster until they're whipped into butter. Then the mother turns it into pancakes. Luke explained, \"It was really relevant to that song in particular because it's really fast and goes round and around in a pattern.\"\n\nAmerican guitar virtuoso and idol to spotty manchildren for over three decades, Joe Satriani, has written thirteen instrumental albums and earned fifteen Grammy nominations (but, amazingly, no wins). His album titles range from 1995's bemusing Joe Satriani featuring the tune 'Luminous Flesh Giant', all the way up to 2008's loopy Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock, home to 'Diddle-Y-A-Doo-Dat'.\n\nSo, while talking to him about his 3D concert film Satchurated: Live In Montreal, I took the opportunity to ask the man who has written hundreds of songs and no lyrics, how do you title your songs?\n\n\"Most of the songs are written about experiences with people and places,\" the fleet-fingered, softly-spoken guitar hero muses, \"They have titles as I start to write. It's something that I'm hooked into right from the beginning.\"\n\nHe talks about a landmark title track 'Flying In A Blue Dream' from his 1989 Billboard Top 25 album. \"It just came into my head, the memory of having flying dreams as a child,\" he explains, so he focused on the feeling and wrote the song in a few minutes.\n\n\"It's not that important to me that people know the experience, because it is instrumental music and I want people to be able to own it in their own way. If someone hears 'Flying In A Blue Dream' and it feels like a happy song or a sad song or a spiritual song or something they like to listen to when they're snowboarding, that's up to them, that's the freedom that I give them to associate to the song in any way. But for me, it's very important to stay true to the original inspiration so that I can play specifically to that song.\"\n\nHere's a picture of Canadian instrumental post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor, because they titled four songs 'motherfucker=redeemer'.\n\n\"I think to be a good instrumentalist you can't be general,\" he declares. \"You can't be yourself playing the same old thing over every song. That only works when you're in a rock band, where the singer is singing different lyrics to every song and when it comes to your guitar break you can do your little 'identity' thing. It doesn't really matter very much because the song's got lyrics which are telling people what the song is about.\"\n\n\"The instrumental is different because it suffers from not having lyrics,\" he offers, \"so you have to be very descriptive with the way that you play. Every song you treat with kid gloves, so to speak. What helps me do that is to lock into that story right at the very beginning and focus on that title.\"\n\nDo lyrics stymie people's appreciation of the music because the lyrics dictate a story in people's head? Can lyrics actually distract from the mood of the music?\n\n\"For thousands of years there's been instrumental music in all genres,\" he says, \"We could take the big block of four or five hundred years of classical music as an example. Even with people who don't understand Italian, with opera, they're free to associate with what the music is about. You're just letting the music wash over you and projecting your own meaning to it. That is the strength of instrumental music.\"\n\n\"I can tell you as a songwriter over the years, you can really ruin a good musical idea with bad lyrics,\" he chuckles.\n\nHe talks about the song 'Bigfoot' by his Chickenfoot project with Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony from Van Halen and Red Hot Chili Pepper drummer Chad Smith. He titled it because the song sounded as imposing as the fabled woodland giant, but Hagar's lyrics turned it around to describing a driver's 'big foot' on the gas pedal, racing to his girlfriend's house.\n\nYou can hear a wry tone in Satriani's voice as he notes, \"It takes a lyricist's frame of mind to really come up with a story like that.\""}

{"text":"ABOUT THIS ALBUM\n\nAlbum Notes\n\nWILLAMETTE WEEK ... The group\u2014which sounds a bit like Band of Horses without all the studio bells and whistles\u2014trades in chord progressions and drum patterns normally associated with summery pop groups, but your takeaway emotion will likely be melancholy. It's a neat trick, actually: The record's stark, slightly seasick sheen calls more attention to the Historians' understated twang than to its tom or kick drum (the percussion floats in a mist somewhere behind the track). That, combined with frontman Dave Shur's achingly pure vocal approach, gives tracks like opener \"Flathead Lake\" and \"Old King Crow\" a rustic, AM-pop feel often tapped into by bands like R.E.M. and Okkervil River. But it's \"On the Way Home\" that reveals Future Historians' true colors: Sad bastards through and through. It's working out for them. CASEY JARMAN"}

{"text":"Thailand?s ?Motorcade? incorporates many popular indie rock styles from roughly the past five years. The album seems very slick and ambitious and you can hear bits of lots of popular bands in here, but ultimately, what you don?t hear is a unique voice or interpretation from Thailand.\n\nTalent wise, the band is not bad. They manage to sound pretty tight throughout and the music is decently arranged, however, the songs themselves all begin to sound the same. Also, I think at least two-thirds of the tracks begin with either a fade-in or quiet building up to loud. Really, this just made me feel impatient and I wondered when the hell songs were going to start. A slow build-up works once or twice on an album of short pop ditties such as this, but clearly there are other ways to begin a song.\n\nOnce they do actually get going, the songs on the disc seem to alternate between Franz Ferdinand and Strokes songs, all the while being backed up by Ladytron?s keyboards. Vocally, you wind up with another indie rock grab bag, as the singer does a mean impression of the vocalists from both Interpol and the New Pornographers (the dude, not Neko Case). Really, it?s nearly impossible to listen to this disc without thinking that you?ve heard the whole thing before. 2\/10 -- Matt Blackall(10"}
{"text":"REVIEWSDead Confederate, 'Wrecking Ball'\n\nDead Confederate play exactly the kind of music a band called Dead Confederate should -- sluggish, sorrowful, searing, and Southern in virtually all the right ways. The Georgia quintet's debut may appeal to My Morning Jacket fans, but songs like \"Heavy Petting\" and \"Start Me Laughing\"(which recalls Kurt Cobain at his nastiest) possess more growl than that comparison implies. Then there's the atmospheric, album-defining \"The Rat,\" which simmers and soars -- and somehow makes the phrase \"Stupid human, shit for brains\" sound not just sensible, but vaguely significant."}
{"text":"Texas-born singer and songwriter Hilary York combines a bit of blues, jazz, folk, country and alternative in her thought provoking music. She released \"The Moon\" in 2006 and In The Dark in 2009, both on the Hey Miau label. Spinner had a chat with Hilary York before her SXSW appearance.\n\nDescribe your sound in your own words.\n\nI would say it's like very American, like blues and jazz and folk. I feel like a take a lot from all genres.\n\nHow did you get into professional music?\n\nI always thought I wanted to be a song writer. I wrote poetry pretty much my whole life, since I was real young. I would sing with my family, just like cover songs, Beatles songs, \"Moon River\" with my stepmother. I just entertained the family. It wasn't until about 10 years ago that I started getting out there and performing, doing open mikes. I learned guitar.\n\nWhat are your musical influences?\n\nEarly on the Beatles, but my parents were really into music, and they owned a record store before I was born in Pasadena, Texas, so they played a lot of music around the house. I saw David Bowie perform on some old video of his, and at the time I was living in Australia, and I thought he was amazing. Kate Bush. Randy Newman and Nina Simone. Tom Waits. I'm really into lyrics. The first time I heard Nina Simone I didn't know if she was a man or a woman. I was fascinated. I really like when you don't know what someone looks like by their voice.\n\nWhat is your biggest vice?\n\nPeople. I'm super fascinated by people and their interactions and relationships. I've been a bartender for a long time, and I just get a lot of influences and creativity from watching and interacting with people, and my friendships and my family.\n\nDo you consider it difficult being a female musician in a world that is dominated by male musicians?\n\nI do sometimes. I don't always think about it, but sometimes their reactions, not all of them are like this, but sometimes they put us all in the same category -- singer\/songwriters that are women -- when maybe their music and voices are completely different. Sometimes you think people are talking down to you, but I just think it's the way people are raised or some sort of cultural thing, and they're just not used to it.\n\nIt's my second record. I self produced with a friend of mine Kullen Fuchs. He collaborated. It's just very personal. It's pretty dark, kind of a break up album. It's pretty heavy. At the same time, I'm one of those people who listens to heavy music even if I'm in a really good mood and in a good place. Its honest song writing and I'm really proud of it.\n\nColleen Larson is a contributor from Seed.com. Learn how you can contribute here."}
{"text":"1. Which song from Pinkerton is your favorite?\n\"The Good Life.\" I remember listening to that and thinking, \"I also don't want to be an old man anymore\" \u2014 even though I was in high school. Still, somehow I felt like I could relate, like it was about not wanting to be uptight and lame all the time. I was lame and uptight all the time, and despite lots of sugar in my tea, I've sort of remained that way. Oh well, still a great song.\n\n2. Do you have a specific memory tied to listening to the album?\nI was dating a girl who always suggested that Pains should sound more like Weezer. I totally agreed, but it's hard, ya know? For starters, I can't shred. Rivers can shred. Also, they have big Marshall amps and I have a Roland Jazz Chorus (it sounds like its name, for those who are wondering). And their songs are better constructed, they have pre-choruses, harmonies, riffs, modulations. Maybe someday we'll get there.\n\n3. Has Pinkerton, or Weezer in general, influenced your band at all?\nYeah, I think we referenced the dry heavy guitar and unaffected vocals a lot when working on our second album, but the British people we were recording with weren't super familiar with it. They'd always be like, \"Every American band we ever meet won't shut up about bloody Weezer.\" Unnatural amounts of Weezer love is sort of a uniquely American thing \u2014 because they sound so American. I really like that. USA! USA! USA!\n\n4. What are your thoughts on Weezer, circa 2010?\nIt's really unfair when people consider their first two albums total genius perfection (to me they are), but then turn around and say everything else they've ever done is worthless. It's a weird take on a songwriter\/band who continues to write really good rock songs, and it tends to mythologize those first records a bit too much. I mean, \"Pork and Beans\" was a good song, and \"Island in the Sun\" was great too. It's like, they wrote two five-star records that defined a generation and continues to hold tremendous influence, which is about two more than just about every band ever will ever do.\n\n1. Which song from Pinkerton is your favorite?\n\"Tired of Sex.\" It's so raw and aggressive \u2014 the opening feedback, the thumping drums, the fuzzed-out bass...and then the absolutely ripping solo. Plus, the second verse is killer, pitch-perfect, building-the-momentum, with the guitars edging out and pushing into the red, and Rivers really stretching his voice, leading you right into that solo. The whole song just kicks with that combo of being out of control and totally tight. When they snap into the half-time at the end, it feels like they're all banging on their gear at the same time, and it's magically working out.\n\nIt's also one of those amazing first songs on an album that sets the stage for what's to come. And in this case, I feel like it's sort of a great middle finger to people coming in from The Blue Album. Because Pinkerton's not quite the In Utero to The Blue Album's Nevermind, but in some ways it is. And they establish that pretty quickly and pretty clearly.\n\n2. Do you have a specific memory tied to listening to the album?\nI actually most remember buying it and not liking it. Just being confused by it. Listening to it for the first time with another friend who was a big Weezer fan, and both of us sort of looking at each other like, \"Hey, what is this? Maybe let's listen to \u00e2\ufffd'\ufffd\ufffd\u0153El Scorcho\u00e2\ufffd'\ufffd\ufffd\"\ufffd again.\" And then coming back to it a little later, living with it for a while, and ending up thinking it was cool and dark and totally about where I was at the time.\n\nBut I also really remember when it was this fucking enigma. It's become much more \"understood\" recently, but there really was a point in time when it was like, \"Is this the last thing they had to say?\" And that gave it this really interesting position. There were those whispers about Songs from the Black Hole and the whole leg-correction surgery thing, but you really didn't know. You had these two magnificent albums and then a total disappearance. It gave Pinkerton this different kind of weighted importance.\n\n3. Has Pinkerton, or Weezer in general, influenced your band at all?\nClearly, the short answer is yes \u2014 Weezer's a huge influence. Your Youth is a loud pop band, and Weezer is a big touchstone in that regard. Some people have tried calling us out on that, using it as some sort of pejorative, but we think the comparison is a compliment. It means people are getting what we're trying to do. Even if they don't like it, they get it ... The other part is what [Rivers is] singing about\/his attitude. The first two Weezer records were about embracing the fact that they were weird and quirky and charming, and then wrapping it up in Marshall stacks. I get a lot from that, both as a guy listening to a rock record and as a guy in a rock band trying to write songs.\n\n4. What are your thoughts on Weezer, circa 2010?\nI mean, there are clearly two Weezers \u2014 the line in the sand coming in between their first two records and the rest of it. The first Weezer is one of my favorite bands of all-time; the second one exists. Even your heroes get old. Even though I don't listen to their albums anymore, it doesn't take away from how much I enjoy what they did. Plus, \"Pork and Beans\" is good. Listen to it again. Loud. I swear."}
{"text":"Echodrone \u2013 Bon Voyage\n\nThere's an often repeated opinion that Shoegaze is \"the scene that celebrates itself\". That probably was more of a buzz expression used many eons ago than the real soul of the genre. Shoegaze is more about creating layered atmospheres and otherworldly landscapes, not unwarranted self importance.\n\nEchodrone plays a shoegaze that is frothy, but not in soapy suds that garishly appear in lattes. Echodrone is more like a well made cappuccino. You know the ones, where you can still see the layer dividing milk and coffee, with cinnamon lightly sprinkled over the dense froth.\n\nBon Voyageis a collection of 6 songs from this band that hails from San Francisco, a city that is trippy by itself and which does celebrate too many things about themselves (some justified, though). But, again, Echodrone come with many emotions, but none of them is cocky bravado.\n\nLike a morning bike ride through Lombard Street, 'Under an impressive sky' doodles with an arpeggio before exploding in your very ears; auditory canals perceiving every note that is distorted and reverberated. Loud follows quiet\/dreamy. The voice of Meredith Gibbons comes across as a distant fog alarm, travelling through the spaces that the instrumentation has torn asunder. There are moments where it becomes too calm and that feeling of dread comes back again, hitting like a surprise wave and pulling you under like a riptide.\n\n'Hypnogogic' is a spacier one, where there is some vocal sparring between female and male (Eugene Suh) vocals. It's a dynamic that is quintessential to shoegaze (possibly as much as the heavy reverb). It's a gorgeous yarn, the one being spun by Echodrone. 'Cold Snap' again uses a double vocal approach and you know this is lift off. This is the sun showered morning drive through the mountains in a cold day. Memories passing through your head, fading away like the images in your rearview mirror. It's a gorgeous moment how the song becomes droning, like a mantra, with the drumming having a ball here. 'Pure Nickel' is sort of the spiritual sister of 'Cold Snap', almost a continuation of the ideas, but with the volume turned up quite a lot. Cohesive and lovely.\n\nNow, we get two very strong tracks by the end of this joyride. 'Infinite arms' starts acoustically, with Eugene Suh singing forlornly. An explosion of sound will never come like in the other tracks, instead, the layers aren't neither distorted nor reverberated, but they soar high and mighty, probably because the ebow tone is so beautiful that it becomes as engaging as a chiaroscuro painting. 'Constant' starts with some beautiful swells and although the layers seem peaceful like in the previous track, a full pedal stomp eagerly awaits to blow your speakers. You're now floating in space"}
{"text":"What Was Matmos Thinking?\n\nBy Roland Li\n\nOn Matmos's new album, The Ganzfeld EP, the duo tried a new recording technique: telepathy. They recruited some 50 people to speak into microphones while Matmos's Drew Daniel tried to psychically transmit ideas to them. The deluxe version also includes a kit that will allow listeners to set up a similar experience.\n\nIt was another unconventional step for Matmos, which also includes Martin (M.C.) Schmidt. The group has gained notice for its practice of mining the sounds of reality for sonic recuts. On \"A Chance to Cut Is a Chance To Cure,\" they took the sounds of the surgery room and used them as fodder for oddly melodic avant-garde tracks. On \"The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast,\" they paid tribute to influences like William S. Borroughs by using instruments including a cow uterus [pictured, above].\n\nMatmos, which is a romantic couple in addition to a musical one, spoke to Interview about their new work, celebrating a 20-year anniversary, and their legacy.\n\nROLAND LI: How did you make the new album?\n\nDREW DANIEL: Our records are always described as concept albums, and I wanted to take that to its logical extreme by setting up a situation where the concept was triggering things in the minds of other people. So telepathic research seemed like the best way to isolate the thinking mind with its concept. We had people on a mattress relaxing, listening to white noise on headphones with their eyes covered. I would sit in another room with my eyes covered and try to transmit the concept of the new Matmos album. They were told to empty their minds and describe what they were hearing and we made the record out of that.\n\nLI: What was the concept you were trying to convey?\n\nMARTIN SCHMIDT: Drew won't even tell me.\n\nDANIEL: Yeah, I'll never tell anyone what I was thinking, because I want it to remain a pure conceptual situation, in which the private content of one mind will be causally responsible for the outcome. I've never told Martin, I've never told any of the subjects, because I think the project would then collapse into either verifying or debunking telepathy, and I'm not interested in contributing to either side of that debate. It has to have a musical component that's compelling even if you don't appreciate the concept at all.\n\nLI: Do you think music is more about concept or just pleasurable sounds?\n\nSCHMIDT: Music is a really weird art form. It really occupies a place like nothing else. I don't know. Music can be used as so many things. It can used as a distraction. It can be used as a tool to bring attention to something.\n\nDANIEL: It can be used as a torture device.\n\nSCHMIDT: Frequently, what Drew puts on in the car is torture for me and total pleasure for him. Overall\u2014it sounds like a jackass to say it\u2014but I think it's about illuminating life.\n\nDANIEL: I think concepts are entertainment for me.\n\nLI: Specifically, what do you consider the goal of your music to be?\n\nSCHMIDT: I can load it with baggage, but when it's heard in another setting, I have no control over how it's received, and I love that.\n\nDANIEL: Hopefully, it can flow in both directions. I like that our work can be not heard but just described through process. But it's also fun to make the concepts into a musical form. Like our song \"Green Triangle\" has the idea of \"phoniness.\" How would I express that through sound? For me, there's a particular software that can model fake human voices and convey that idea. It's like solving a puzzle. We're usually working with real stuff, like we made a record out of surgery, so it's exciting when someone asks you to do something fake.\n\nLI: I wanted to go back to the idea of process. You guys are known for unconventional techniques. How did you get attracted to experimental instruments?\n\nDANIEL: Definitely. We're ripping off dead French guys like Pierre Henry's Variations for a Door & A Sign and Pierre Schaeffer's synthesizers.\n\nLI: Did you start out in experimental music?\n\nSCHMIDT: I never listened to any pop music until I was 16. My father kept me on classical\u2014not cruelly, but I heard nothing except classical until I was 16. I could see that the kids who beat me up in intermediate school were into this rock music, so I kind of didn't want anything to do with it. But I realized I should grow my hair long and listen to this hard rock music, and I stopped getting beaten up.\n\nDANIEL: I was a breakdancer when I was 17, so I started on hip-hop. Then I got into punk rock, and I was straight-edge. There was no experimentation, but then I got into noise and industrial. And I had been jerking off to William S. Borroughs because of the descriptions of gay sex, but they also had descriptions of elaborate uses of tape recorders.\n\nLI: How does technology impact our music?\n\nSCHMIDT: What's amazing about technology is you figure that recording has all these decisions. In electronic music, the tools and results are often collapsed together, like all laptop music is one genre, when obviously it's not. I think the freedom that we have to cut and paste is extremely radical, but people are shy about that because they're attached to the idea of warmth and human process. But I think it's exciting when those concepts are stretched between warm and cold. I kind of like music that can't make up its mind.\n\nLI: Did you start out playing instruments?\n\nSCHMIDT: I took piano lessons when I was 12, but I got all Fs when I was in sixth grade, and my father took me out of them, the only thing I was good at. Dumb father.\n\nDANIEL: I had no musical training, but I was into tape recorders because of Borroughs. But Martin taught me what I can do now.\n\nSCHMIDT: It was really just a pick-up technique, but the guy just won't leave.\n\nLI: [laughs] How has being in a relationship affected your work?\n\nDANIEL: I don't know what's parasite and what's host anymore. We're like a band that's been infested by a couple. We're so bonded on a molecular level that it's hard to imagine a post-breakup Matmos. Our 20th anniversary is on Halloween, so this show at 285 Kent is going to be our anniversary show, which is crazy. In gay years, that's like 1,000 fucking years.\n\nLI: What are your differences creatively?\n\nDANIEL: We take turns on being in charge of albums. Martin is more likely to pick up an object and make music with it. I'm more conceptual. Martin is just a better musician than I am.\n\nSCHMIDT: Damn right!\n\nLI: You just switched labels from Matador to Thrill Jockey. What prompted that?\n\nDANIEL: Matador was cool, they were nice to us. But after 12 years, we were like that overstaying guest and we felt we were supposed to leave. I was sad about it, but we called up Thrill Jockey and they were really supportive. So many of the Baltimore folks are on Thrill Jockey, too.\n\nLI: Do you feel that music has value anymore?\n\nDANIEL: That's why I wanted to pursue this conceptual project, I think that debate of whether music is attached to physical stuff ties into that. I think it still does, but increasingly, younger people don't feel tethered to that at all. Your release becomes purely files, which has changed how titles work for us and how the data inside the song changes. Our new songs start out with a loud sound from the recording process, so you get a sense of the art.\n\nSCHMIDT: Here's my speech that I give to kids. How many people have their hard drive from 12 years ago? Not many. I still have records from high school, because they're still objects. I don't think my friends who are 24 will have that file when they're 30 or 40.\n\nDANIEL: I like to pull my copy of Misfits' Legacy of Brutality off the shelf. I have fanaticism, which is a material thing in the world. You can always replace files, but it's not the same.\n\nLI: What do you want Matmos to be remember for?\n\nSCHMIDT: Outstanding quality. Drew?\n\nDANIEL: I hope people would become extremists, like the idea that I would burn my flesh with a cigarette to pursue a concept, or we would go into a sterile operating room to pursue sound there. I would hope that I contributed to the history of sound as a way of thinking about the world and dealing with the world. And that's the most grandiose thing I can think of. You don't get to write your own ticket, and I like that what you thought you were changes over time. When we started, we wanted to make squelchy acid techno.\n\nTHE GANZFELD EP IS OUT OCTOBER 16, AND MATMOS PLAYS 285 KENT TOMORROW, OCTOBER 13. FOR MORE ON THE DUO, VISIT THEIR WEBSITE."}

{"text":"Orson\n\nIt was only two years ago that the name Orson would have brought puzzled looks and furrowed brows in the musical world. But then they released a song about drinking Red Bull until six o'clock, gave us an album jam-packed with AM Radio anthems and juicy pop hooks, and stole themselves a legion of dedicated fans thanks to the dashing good looks of their trilby-wearing frontman. Brit Awards, Robbie Williams support slots and a number one record followed accordingly. It's been less than a year since their last single, but they are already back with follow-up album Culture Vultures and are ready to hit the road to show the UK their new 'rock' direction. DS caught up with singer Jason Pebworth and drummer Chris Cano to chat about leaving the US, their single 'Ain't No Party' and why they hate indie music.\n\nSo guys, what have you been up to? Are you sick of the interviews yet?\n\nJason: \"Ahh, we haven't been here too long, it's fine. What we up to? We thought we've finished the album, now we'll get a little bit of a break, and you know, let the dust settle and get rested up before we go on tour... But no! They had the single on the radio before we even finished the album. We had to take a couple of days off to go film the video and it's go, go, go, go, go, go.\"\n\nChris: \"We're not complaining.\"\n\nJason: \"Certainly not complaining, this is the good stuff.\"\n\nThe new single 'Ain't No Party' is out on the 15th. What's the general idea behind it and the inspiration for the song?\n\nJason: \"It was kind of a... sort of a... I don't want to say a joke, it was sort of a response to the fact that every year, the Oscars happen and it's creepy because it's the one night of the year when it's like a ghost town. Because everyone's at the party! We all had these crazy odd jobs that you just keep when you're in bands, but they were all in the industry. Chris worked on a television show and did some tape stuff and I was a personal assistant for some guy. You'd think we were kind of connected to the Hollywood community and maybe we'll be able to get in to one of these parties or whatever. We never got in!\"\n\nChris: \"Not once! Not once!\"\n\nJason: \"So I kinda thought, 'Man, we're going to make the best party ever!' I wrote that as a response to that whole thing, feeling jipped out. Pretending we are having the best party ever that nobody has bothered to show up to.\"\n\nHas that changed since you shot to fame?\n\nJason: \"We still don't get quite enough. We still don't get a lot.\"\n\nChris: \"Not a lot of invitations.\"\n\nSo is the song a request for an invitation to more parties?\n\nJason: \"Not really... We did get asked to play a girl guides' show. That was good. You've got to start somewhere.\"\n\nChris: \"Hahaha.\"\n\nReally? How was that?\n\nJason: \"It was crazy...\"\n\nChris: \"Screaming.\"\n\nJason: \"There's definitely a particular frequency of about 15 thousand, 8 to 13-year-olds. When they scream - wow - that's something. That is something.\"\n\nSo have you not really experienced that much rock 'n' roll excess?\n\nJason: \"Yeah, you know what, we've been around so much. We've seen it all, we've seen quite a bit, we're not really... we did do it, several, several years ago. We were all kinda heavy into that but unfortunately we didn't then have a successful act to go with it.\"\n\nChris: \"A case of cart before the horse, buddy.\"\n\nJason: \"With a little bit of money that would have been great... and so we've done the dumb thing and got cleaned up.\"\n\nChris: \"All screwed up and nowhere to play!\"\n\nJason: \"So we watch it and go 'yeah, that's kinda cool' but we just enjoy watching and taking it in and making sure people get in their cars safely.\"\n\nChris: \"Text us when you get home.\"\n\nJason: \"We're kinda those guys, Orson is like the designated driver of rock 'n' roll.\"\n\nA lot of bands try to get more serious or political or their second albums...\n\nChris: \"NOT US!\"\n\n... but you appear to have just made a more traditional rock 'n' roll record.\n\nJason: \"Just a little bit louder!\"\n\nWas that a deliberate policy to avoid political issues?\n\nJason: \"You know what, there's so many great people who do that already. It's not that we can't be bothered, it's just that's not what we do. What we're really good at is...\"\n\nChris: \"Feel good stuff, you know...\"\n\nJason: \"Lyrically there's some stuff, if you want to delve in there and peel it apart. There's stuff that comes from some hurtful places or whatever. We are so connected now. We have access to so much stuff. Whereas before in rock and roll, your media avenues were very limited. When you heard the Beatles say stuff, they really wanted to change the world.\"\n\nChris: \"They could turn you on to new information.\"\n\nJason: \"And we just don't have that any more. I mean we have fans coming up to us saying 'I'll see you at the secret gig next week', and I'm going 'what, what gig?' They know my schedule before I know it! It doesn't mean that it will never happen but I think Orson's about having a really good time and feeling great. Not like it's 'Oooh Weee, we're so positive, let's get on the positive tip'. Not silly in that way. Its just 'let's all have a good time ya'll'.\"\n\nYou guys have been relocated to the UK. You guys must love it! Why do you think you've been such a hit over here?\n\nJason: \"It is where our jobs are.\"\n\nChris: \"To commute here would be a bitch. I think a lot of it has to do with the fans over here, they are really, really faithful and they really like music out here. I mean it was so mind-boggling to me last year seeing this. We went to gigs and played gigs and there would be families there. Kids and their parents. It would be an outing. It would be an event. Music is something very special here. Whereas in Los Angeles or where we're from it's something to work out to, or it's kind of scenery. Here it's kind of vital to what's going on. In Europe as well. Which is great for us, because we love to go out and play. That's my kind of take on it anyway.\"\n\nDo you miss the US at all then?\n\nJason: \"Yeah, it's home. Of course you do. Of course you're going to miss home. But it's not that much different really, honestly. People wanna rock, people wanna have a good time.. they really do...\"\n\nChris: \"It's true.\"\n\nJason: \"What you have to understand is that London is a big city. It's more like New York. And we're from Los Angeles, which is spread out, and a more suburbia kind of a feel, a really centralised feeling. I mean who can really say why certain things happen in America and some things don't? It's like hip-hop, I mean there's a little bit of hip-hop out here, but why isn't there the giant hip-hop market over here? Why isn't country and western huge over here? It's just different. If we set out to do country and western, we'd probably do well, but it's just not the music we love. And quite frankly most of our big influences are from over here. Like the Stones, Radiohead and Zeppelin...\"\n\nChris: \"And Queen.\"\n\nJason: \"And we just mix it with our own.... Motown.\"\n\nChris: \"Haha... but yes I miss home.\"\n\nYou've been quoted as saying your new album Culture Vultures will be your 'rock' album. Is that true?\"\n\nJason: \"Who said that?\"\n\nIt was on your MySpace.\n\nChris: \"The last record was rock too...\"\n\nJason: \"I think we deliberately set out to make an album first time round as the anti-indie album. Partly in response to the fact that - and this was in 2004, 2005 - we were so over indie turning into what it was turning into. And I still have a problem with it. Indie was turning into this [culture] in America. Indie is a haircut. For the amount of money that people spend on this whole indie culture and to still call it indie, it's the biggest crock I've ever heard! There's so much money dumped into this word indie.\"\n\nChris: \"Which means it's not indie.\"\n\nJason: \"And it actually turned into this sound which was just a rip-off, of a rip-off, of a rip-off of something. And we love jangly rock. We love all that stuff, but it was so cluttered. We needed to find our own way into it. And we worked hard on trying to find our own sound. When we were actually recording our album we had all the time in the world, because we were recording it ourselves for nothing. So we experimented with lots of things... I was listening to Steely Dan, and Fleetwood Mac, and The Eagles, and The Doobie Brothers, and Hall and Oates, and Earth Wind and Fire.\"\n\nChris: \"All the good stuff.\"\n\nJason: \"And Bobby Womack. We set out to make these kinds of sounds.\"\n\nChris: \"We just tried to figure out what out favourite bands were listening to when they made their records and just look at the lineage there, and that's where you tap into something. And we made that stylistic record. And it's a rock 'n' roll record too.\n\nJason: \"When we played these songs live though, I think people genuinely were quite taken aback by how loud we are. And sweaty.\"\n\nChris: \"Yeah we're a rock and roll band, there was no denying that from the beginning.\"\n\nJason: \"So with this album we decided to make more of an album. Plus we did it really quick. This time round, we still got the same guy to come around and do it. Reasonable budget, we still did it all on our computers, we didn't want to mess around too much, just go in there and turn everything up really loud.\"\n\nChris: \"We were such a unit all last year on the road, playing different gigs, [being] on the road and playing, playing, playing. You become a fine tuned athlete by the end of that and we're still on that wave now. We just rolled into the studio that way and we captured that. Orson has a nice swimmer's body now.\"\n\nAre you guys looking forward to getting back on the road then?\n\nJason: \"Oh yeah absolutely! Also with this next album we wanted people to get excited about the live show. I think before it was like, 'Woah yeah, I like a few of these songs, they could sound kinda cool live'. But this time, you turn all the guitars up on the album and you'll go, 'Man, oh I can't wait to see this live'.\"\n\nYou've got a song called 'Cool Cops'. Are you attacking anyone in particular with that tune?\n\nJason: \"I think it's sort of...it's about trying to please the gatekeepers of all things cool - all the time. It gets to be hard work. Even at school it was like, 'Wrong shoes pal. Back of the line'. It's hard, hard f****** work being super hip all the time. Even artists, people who put you at this super hip level. People are ready to shoot you down. And you know what's funny is that it's so predictable. We are so far away from trying to be cool. We worked really hard in Los Angeles and found this niche audience and we were getting so much of, 'Woah this is the underground thing'. There was this whole underground buzz around and everyone was like, 'Why aren't these guys signed? The record industry better wake up'. But then, the second you get a record label behind you and they plaster you everywhere, people go, 'Oh no way man!'.\"\n\nChris: \"Haters!\"\n\nJason: \"It's territorial, people want to feel part of something. It's like why is one football team better than another team. It's very rarely because one team outscores another team. It's usually more to do with hometown pride and so 'Cool Cops' is just kinda being funny, because you're never going to win, so just get on with it.\"\n\nYou guys have achieved so much in such a short space of time. What ambitions have you got left?\n\nChris: \"If we're afforded to do this again on our next album - that's pretty good. If we're able to promote [the band] and still go out and play, that's a win-win situation. I mean we played all the football arenas, all last year with Robbie Williams. We played the biggest gigs. Granted, they weren't our gigs but there were still massive amounts of people. And getting to play our music in front of people, as clich\u00e9 as that sounds, is great.\"\n\nJason: \"And we're doing some soundtracks.\"\n\nReally? What for?\n\nJason: \"I can't really say right now. Also a possible West End premiere.\"\n\nOrson: The Musical, perhaps?\n\nJason: \"Actually who knows what we're all about? We like our hands in a lot of different buckets. We like working with lots of different people, we like supporting live music wherever we can and who knows where that's going to lead. But you know Chris is right. The days of selling Michael Jackson numbers, 30-50 million albums, it just wont happen. It just doesn't happen any more. So you know, you've got to reign in the lifestyle a little bit. You've got to put music out faster, you've got to get out on the road. You gotta connect to your fans. If you can just continue to do that, and stay alive.\"\n\nChris: \"... you're in good shape.\"\n\nJason: \"And that's what we strive to do.\"\n\nThanks guys!\n\nOrson's new single 'Ain't No Party' is out on October 15. Their new album Culture Vultures follows a week later on October 22."}
{"text":"Review:\n\nThis album is to post-rock what Pink Floyd's Dark Side was to psychadelic rock; the blueprint, the high-water mark. Released as a double-album with 4 movements split onto both discs, Lift Yr. Skinny Fists is a masterpiece of the rock format being twisted into something much larger than itself. All of the nearly-dozen members work like a fluid form, connected almost telepathically and pouring through the speakers like a musical torrent of water. The sound picture is at once massive and epic, and tinny, subtle and atmospheric. Between sweeping orchestral movements, the band intertwines various tape samples and overdubs which add a certain amount of context to the hazy theme present. The two movements that really sell the album are \"Static\" and \"Sleep\", the former with it's unbelievably creepy radio-preacher interlude and painfully drawn-out build, the latter containing some of the most inspired and monumental musical passages this reviewer has ever heard on record. It almost becomes too much to handle; the crawling builds and crescendos overflowing with power and glory and, more than anything, hope. Hope seems to be the theme here, and while anyone could spend vast amounts of time trying to figure out just what the band is trying to say (considering they say nothing in the literal sense), the beauty of it is that almost anyone will take something different from the music. That's the true essense and gift of game that GY!BE owns, and damn near has patented in the realm of post-rock. Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven is absolutely perfect in that it demands a sharp ear while simultaneously rewarding the less-attentive with heavy, crisp and catchy rock.\nRating: 10\/10"}
{"text":"I had this sent to me after I posted the Stoney review. Unfortunately I've lost the message so I can't remember who sent it - if you read this, please shoot me an ask so I can credit you properly!\n\nPianos are a seriously undervalued instrument in rock music. Sure, they're a common tool of the trade for plenty of comedy rockers (Tim Minchin, Axis of Awesome et al), and god knows how many hours of schlock have been filled with mopey white twenty-somethings hammering out ballads. But as a straight-up lead it's generally eschewed in favour of the guitar.\n\nAnd that's a shame, because I think the piano can lend a certain immediacy of tone to a song that most other instruments can't. There's a reason it's the instrument most often called upon for 'scare chords' and the like - a couple of discordant notes can be all that is needed to set the listener on edge for the entirety of a song (for more fantastic evidence of this, I highly recommend checking out The Paper Chase).\n\nThe piano used by The Great Imposter fulfills a similar purpose. It's upbeat, certainly, but at the same time there's a hint of menace to it that subtly turns the songs from straightforward swinging rock numbers into something more sinister. It's a delicate balancing act, which comes off best on songs like 'Tell Me. What? Tell Me Again', which adds in some slightly unhinged lyrics and crazed horns to make my favourite kind of song - a chaotic one. Very appropriate, given the EP name."}
{"text":"The Runaway\n\nThe Magic Numbers have always specialised in crafting the kind of winsome guitar pop that leaves you with a warm, fuzzy feeling and a smile on your face. On album number three, the cuddly siblings have embarked upon a more ambitious sonic voyage with Bj\u00f6rk producer Valgeir Sigur\u00f0sson at the helm. Alongside the trademark harmonies is lush orchestration courtesy of Nick Drake's string arranger, the odd nod to Fleetwood Mac and, on 'Hurt So Good', a cosmic, gospel dreaminess that would fit snugly on Spirtualized's Let It Come Down. So whilst The Runaway may be no less endearing than previous efforts, it's infinitely more satisfying"}

{"text":"Luna\n\nPet Rock; 2008\n\nArtists:\n\nFind it at:\n\nIf the Aliens remind you of the Beta Band, it's because they almost are the Beta Band. When the Betas split in 2004, three of its original members-- keyboardist John MacLean, drummer Robin Jones, and guitarist Gordon Anderson (who had recorded solo as Lone Pigeon)-- decided they still had some creating to do together, and forged the Aliens. The new band, which released its debut album, Astronomy for Dogs, in 2007, like their former band, veers between experimentalism and pop songcraft. Luna, their sophomore effort, is cut from the same cloth.\n\nAt their best, the Aliens are clever composers, tuneful harmonists, and positioned in shallow leftfield. At their worst, they cry out for an editor and wander the outfield when they should be keeping their eye on the ball. Clocking in at over an hour, Luna probably would've been best served by a trim to around 45 minutes. Two songs break the 10-minute mark, and neither justifies it. Opener \"Bobby's Song\" gets good mileage in its midsection from playing with the speed and pitch of the vocal track, but the song takes it too far during a tiresome slowdown near the end. Still, there's a good song swimming in the psychedelic soup, and it pops up in the imaginative harmonica intro and the verses.\n\nThe other epic, \"Billy Jack\", is as unfocused as the movie it's named for. It opens with over a minute of vocals trying to find their way out of a processing morass while keyboards noodle, before finally arriving at a drifting verse that's overpopulated with noise. The song keeps finding its footing, and each time piles on too much reverb and distortion and loses it. They seem to have imagined it as some sort of psychedelic glam epic, but it only becomes that more than six minutes in. In contrast, \"Everyone\" is a great four-minute slice of sunshine pop-psych, with buoyant piano and harmonies.\n\nOther missteps include the awkward way \"Sunlamp Show\" suddenly and sloppily shifts rhythms mid-way through, the three spaced-out electronic interludes where one would suffice, or the repetitive and amelodic \"Magic Man\". On the whole, these songs overshadow the loveliness of the sparse ballad \"Theremin\" and the diaphanous closer \"Blue Mantle.\" But it's \"Boats\", a sort of self-cover of a Lone Pigeon song from 2004's Schoozzzmmii, that does the most to redeem the record with its spectral harmonies and spacious arrangement, which gives the impression of traveling through a galaxy as starbursts of piano drift by. Luna is enjoyable enough to listen to, and a lot of Beta Band followers will find plenty to enjoy here, but it's ultimately an album I didn't like as much as I wanted to, and one that doesn't really find its footing until it's almost over."}
{"text":"The album The House That Dirt Built by The Heavy. Downloaded it off of Amazon today through their Facebook page for $2.99, which is awesome, since the current cultural backwater I reside in doesn't have a proper record store and employees at the big box stores would ask \"the heavy what?\" when I'd ask if they had it.\nThis album fucking rocks"}
{"text":"On a note accompanying his Last Will & Testament, Eric Fiedor claims the mainstream radio stations don't want to play his work. I can only guess the station managers haven't heard it.\n\nIt can't be his sound. Fiedor plays fast-moving blues-rock, both hard-edged and accessible. A chorus of guitars fuse into one layered sound, supported with a confident bass and smoothed by some slick keyboarding. Maybe it's the lyrics. They could be obscene. Maybe they're not. I can't tell, since Fiedor's voice often growls into incoherence. For once, that doesn't matter. I can't understand the exact words coming out of the guitars, either, but that's not why they're worth hearing. Fiedor, along with backup vocalists Herndon and Edmonds, is using his voice as another instrument, and his low, hungover vocals are the perfect match for the band's gravel-laced rock sound. This is especially evident in the beat-driven \"White Man,\" where a single repeated chorus serves as the musical backbone for a song that lets the musicians go wild along its theme.\n\nWhere the lyrics are clear, they move as fast and loose as the music. \"Steak and Potatoes\" is love song celebrating the truly great romances of the world. \"Should Have Been Dead\" is an anthem for every foolhardy man and woman who somehow managed to survive their youth. Slower and groaning with frustration, \"Upside Down Rainbow\" is a conversation with an old man cursed with optimism. The lyrics to all Fiedor's songs are often funny, sometimes thoughtful, but never obscene that I can hear. So that can't be it, either.\n\nSo the only possible good reason that you're not hearing Eric Fiedor right now on local rock station is that they aren't well known. Help remedy that by picking up one of his CDs."}
{"text":"Watch how on \"Tyrants\" Black Mountain takes you through a whole spectrum of sounds. There's the Rush-like intro followed by a fuzz keyboard and funeral dirge drum. They don't leave you there, but instead offer up a 60's psychedelic pick me up. Right on its heels, there's some soulful 70's rock with a dose of Heart. Add an AC\/DC bridge then a Bon Iver\/Neil Young closing verse.\n\n\"Angels\" comes on with a bluesy flair. \"Wucan\" has a Southern Rock mystique with a psychedelic mysteriousness. \"Stay Free\" pairs the falsetto of Bon Iver with some Led Zeppelin acoustic guitar. Then it sounds like Gene Krupa kicks off \"Evil Ways\" with \"Sing, Sing, Sing\" drums that land into a freeform, soul, jazz hard rock. \"Wild Wind\" begins with a \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\"-like drums\u2014a bit slowed down\u2014as an intro which goes into a Pink Floyd-type ballad. Finally, the 16 minute 40 second tribal meditation of \"Bright Lights\" seems like a folkified song from Husker Du's Zen Arcade mantra collection."}
{"text":"At-a-glance\n\nYouTube has brought many aspiring artists to stardom including: Justin Bieber, Cody Simpson, Charice, Karmin and the latest addition Jason Chen. Chen just released his first album titled Gravity. Chen's first cover, Ryan Tedder's \"The Look,\" was posted on his channel minniachillies four years ago. Now 151 videos and over 60,000 subscribers later Chen has finally been able to record his very own album. Although it has not received much attention from viewers there are a few songs that deserve a second listen.\n\nThe title song \"Gravity,\" unfortunately is not very impressive. The electro-sounding start of the song seemed a little out of place with the rest of the song. I guess the music is supposed to sound space-like considering the title, but it didn't really fit with Chen's usual choice of covers. But I can appreciate his adventure with different types of songs. Lyrics wise the words are pretty basic love at first sight themed. But Chen's voice does it justice, with only a small hint of auto tune, perhaps to coincide with the space-theme. Although this particular song was a bit disappointing, the other songs make up for it.\n\nAnother song that is relatively popular with listeners is \"No Distance.\" This song does a great job revealing what Chen's voice is really capable of. Chen doesn't miss a single note, especially the high notes. The music is consistent with Chen's singing profile. However, it has a more obvious pop song sound compared the others. It's about no how far matter one is from their beloved one love, has the power to close that distance. \". . . No matter how far we are from each other, there's no distance from you and I.\" Surprisingly this isn't the most listened to song on the album.\n\nThe most popular song on the album is \"Best Friend,\" and it's not surprising why the music video has over two million views on YouTube. The story is not something we haven't heard before; it's about him falling for his best friend. The song opens with a piano followed by a set of background beats. Overall the song is pretty simple, but it's the simplicity that really attracts the listener. So many songs of the same genre are laced with unnecessary noise and degrading lyrics, hearing something so innocent and basic is a nice change from what is usually on the radio. The small budget music video is cute and fun, and a reminder of how hard every musician works to fulfill their dreams. Chen has also recorded a version in Chinese.\n\nIn its entirety, Gravity is a decent debut for Chen. With a powerful voice and a growing fan base, there is a good chance Chen will rise to the top one day. For now I'll conclude with Chen's catch phrase \"Music never sleeps.\"\n\nAll school newspaper content is copyrighted by individual schools and protected by copyright law.

Recently I stumbled upon The Deluxe Edition, which features an awesome cover of the Violent Femmes classic American Music.Its Similar enough to the original to feel familiar, but different enough to avoid feeling rehashed, and though I don't think Craig Finn Could sound any more different than Gordon Gano, he does a pretty good job filling the shoes.\n\nSlanted and Enchanted: Luxe & Reduxe is a double album by Pavement featuring a remastered version of the band's first studio album Slanted and Enchanted, as well as outtakes & live tracks from the same era as the original release.

I didn't add anything, I just took stuff away. So it ended up being a studio collage where I spliced tape together and added weird stuff, backwards tracks, part of one song on top of part of another song. It was a weird, chaotic mash-up of the album. They're all excerpts from the album versions themselves.\"\n\nThis may be my favorite girls track (it competes with lust for life for the top slot).

{"text":"Captain Beefheart\n\nMy entry into the amazing, frightening world of Don Van Vilet came via The Fall, who covered \"Beatle Bones & Smokin' Stones\" on an early Peel session. I didn't understand Trout Mask Replica when I first heard it, in much the same way that I didn't understand 70s Miles Davis records or Public Image Limited's Metal Box. It didn't fit into anything I would have conceived as \"music\" back then. It was all weird angles and uncomfortable shapes.\n\nYears later, I bought a nice double-disc Beefheart comp, The Dust Blows Forward, and it all finally clicked. Not just the stuff from the titanically influential Trout Mask Replica, but the later less-well-known stuff as well. Cuts from Doc At The Radar Station and Ice Cream For Crow seemed, in retrospect, to cast a huge shadow along the post-punkers and underground music of my 80s youth.\n\nIn prose form, here's why Captain Beefheart was one of a kind - his 10 Commandments Of Guitar Playing:\n\n1. Listen to the birds\n\nThat's where all the music comes from. Birds know everything about how it should sound and where that sound should come from. And watch hummingbirds. They fly really fast, but a lot of times they aren't going anywhere.\n\n2. Your guitar is not really a guitar\n\nYour guitar is a divining rod. Use it to find spirits in the other world and bring them over. A guitar is also a fishing rod. If you're good, you'll land a big one.\n\n3. Practice in front of a bush\n\nWait until the moon is out, then go outside, eat a multi-grained bread and play your guitar to a bush. If the bush doesn't shake, eat another piece of bread.\n\n4. Walk with the devil\n\nOld Delta blues players referred to guitar amplifiers as the \"devil box.\" And they were right. You have to be an equal opportunity employer in terms of who you're brining over from the other side. Electricity attracts devils and demons. Other instruments attract other spirits. An acoustic guitar attracts Casper. A mandolin attracts Wendy. But an electric guitar attracts Beelzebub.\n\n5. If you're guilty of thinking, you're out\n\nIf your brain is part of the process, you're missing it. You should play like a drowning man, struggling to reach shore. If you can trap that feeling, then you have something that is fur bearing.\n\n6. Never point your guitar at anyone\n\nYour instrument has more clout than lightning. Just hit a big chord then run outside to hear it. But make sure you are not standing in an open field.\n\n7. Always carry a church key\n\nThat's your key-man clause. Like One String Sam. He's one. He was a Detroit street musician who played in the fifties on a homemade instrument. His song \"I Need a Hundred Dollars\" is warm pie. Another key to the church is Hubert Sumlin, Howlin' Wolf's guitar player. He just stands there like the Statue of Liberty \u2014 making you want to look up her dress the whole time to see how he's doing it.\n\n8. Don't wipe the sweat off your instrument\n\nYou need that stink on there. Then you have to get that stink onto your music.\n\n9. Keep your guitar in a dark place\n\nWhen you're not playing your guitar, cover it and keep it in a dark place. If you don't play your guitar for more than a day, be sure you put a saucer of water in with it.\n\n10. You gotta have a hood for your engine\n\nKeep that hat on. A hat is a pressure cooker. If you have a roof on your house, the hot air can't escape. Even a lima bean has to have a piece of wet paper around it to make it grow.\n\nRemember seeing him on SNL when I was a very small and impressionable child and my older brother home from college saying it was the coolest thing ever, and me wondering just what the hell was going on.\n\nFew artists have had a bigger impact on rock and roll as we know it today. RIP."}

{"text":"Berberian Sound Studio\n\nReleased almost exactly two years after Broadcast singer Trish Keenan's sudden death from pneumonia, Berberian Sound Studio is the soundtrack of a film by British director Peter Strickland. The film is 1970s-set psychological horror film about the mental breakdown of a sound artist working on an Italian giallo film (a particular subset of pulpy erotic thrillers) with a title that deliberately recalls the singular art-song diva of the 20th century, Cathy Berberian; so obviously, Broadcast was fated to create its soundtrack. On their own merits, these 39 tracks -- only two of which cross the two-minute mark -- don't really constitute a traditional album. If anything, these brief, melancholy music cues deliberately recall the library music LPs (generic, copyright-free film music recorded in the '60s and '70s) that Keenan and her musical partner James Cargill always quoted as one of Broadcast's primary influences. Entirely instrumental except for some brief snatches of wordless vocals from Keenan in the style of Italian soundtrack legend Edda dell'Orso, the album sets an effectively creepy, disorienting mood.

{"text":"We Are The City's New Identity\n\nby Kirsty Chan \u2013 Riverside Secondary, Coquitlam BC May 16, 2011\n\nWe Are the City talks to Youthink about their new album and how far they've come since forming in 2008.\n\nNot many bands could go from high-school outcasts to the inaugural winners of The Peak Performance Project within just a few short years \u2013 and even fewer could have done it while retaining the integrity of Kelowna's We Are The City.\n\nSince forming in 2008, the prog-rock trio has been steadily gaining fans and stunning critics. But 2010 was a year of change for the band as they lost original guitarist, David Menzel, and found a replacement in Blake Enemark.\n\nWith the new lineup in place, in March of 2011, We Are The City released High School, an experimental concept EP that explores the band's high-school memories with the clarity of a few years' worth of hindsight. I recently got a chance to talk to drummer Andy Huculiak about the trio's latest project and what high school was like for the boys of We Are The City.\n\nYT: High School is a concept album. Can you tell us the story of how that concept was developed?\nAH: Cayne [keyboards] and I had a bit of downtime when our [ex]-guitarist, David, was not as much involved in the music. We started a band called High School and it was just us messing around and going lyrically into some places that we wouldn't have gone with We Are The City, like, some darker memories from our past. We didn't really want to associate ourselves with We Are The City so we tied T-shirts over our faces. After that we thought, \"Well, we're recording, we have this material, why not record it?\" So, that's where, I guess, the imagery and the concept came from.\n\nYT: Why write an EP about high school? What is it that you guys found so inspirational about the high-school experience?\nAH: Well, there are a lot of experiences there, positive and negative. High school is a hilarious time because you're just trying to figure out what you want to do with your life, and you've got all these people that are in this one building that are forced to coexist even though everybody is so different, you know? So that for us was just different experiences, parties that we went to, relationships that we had, be it good or bad things. It was just really easy for us to go, \"Oh, remember that time?\" and draw out lyrics from it.\n\nYT: To all those kids in high school right now, what advice do you have?\nAH: Even though there's a lot of expectations and a lot of social pressure and all that, don't let it define who you are as a person. Do what you want to do\u2026 and I would hope that's good things... I feel like a lot of times in high school being a nice person is almost what makes you uncool or something. So, maybe my advice would be to make your own path and not try and follow in the footsteps of someone who's good-looking or a football star or something like that. I guess just be yourself and be a nice person. Things get really cool after you graduate. Just continue to be a nice person and you're set.\n\nYT: How would you describe yourselves in high school?\nAH: Well, in middle school, I was very much the person that was bullied. In high school, I kind of separated myself. I didn't really fit into any groups like the popular kids or the unpopular kids. I just kind of stayed away from all that. That was Cayne and myself; we went to high school together. We were both very\u2026 kind of isolated. We still went to class and everything, but we just didn't really buy into the whole social structure.\n\nYT: How has having a new member affected your band?\nAH: In a lot of ways it's been like a breath of fresh air to have someone come in that's got new ideas and you're experiencing everything new again with them. In other ways, there are definitely some growing pains. As far as the sound goes, it will definitely affect our sound, but I feel really confident that we'll be able to write stuff we're excited about.\n\nYT: What's up next for We Are The City?\nAH: We're going to be writing for the full-length and then recording, then maybe a little bit of touring... It's kind of funny because the EP got released just not too long ago, but it's already been finished for four months\u2026 maybe a bit longer. I feel like I'm just ready to do the next thing. We're really ready, really excited.\n\nYT: Why did you decide to release an EP rather than a full-length album?\nAH: I think there was a lot of pressure on us. We felt a lot of pressure to release \"the next big thing\" like, the next full-length album. Not \"big thing\" like people were expecting big things from us, but \"big thing\" as in a full-length album. People were expecting something from us and I think we just kind of came to the conclusion that that pressure was unnecessary. We didn't need to put that much pressure on ourselves. So we decided to take these songs that we'd written without any intention of them being We Are The City songs and just thought, \"Why not put them on an EP and release that?\" So now we're going to go work on a full-length\u2026 Well, right now, actually, we're writing it. We'll be recording in the summer. It feels a little bit like the pressure's off, which is nice because we've got something out there.\n\nYT: What does the songwriting process look like for you?\nAH: I guess, it's different every time. For the first album it was all three of us: Cayne, myself, and our old guitarist, David. We'd write together and it would be a very tedious process that would take a lot of thought and a lot of working out to get to the final product. For High School, Cayne and I just went with whatever ideas came through our head. It was a very fast process and a very productive one, so that was cool. I'm not entirely sure what the next one will look like, it might be entirely different\u2026 I have no idea.\n\nYT: High School was produced by Tom Dobrzanski from The Zolas. What was it like working with him?\nAH: Oh, awesome. He's just a great guy. They're [The Zolas] great musicians. Actually, we worked with Tom on our last album so we were feeling comfortable with him. He's just great, just a great guy. We have the same goals; we both really want to make something we're proud of, and for Tom it's not just another job. He's really putting himself into it just like us. I guess he could be considered like, a fourth member, which is cool.\n\nYT: You seem to have a good relationship with a lot of local bands and artists. How have those friendships impacted you?\nAH: I'm so humbled to be even friends with some, acquaintances with others. Even, you know, friends of ours, Said The Whale, just won a Juno and I just never imagined myself to be in a position where one of my friends won a Juno. It's so awesome. It's something that, dare I say, the rest of Canada doesn't have, is like, a really tight-knit musical community. On the West Coast and Vancouver in particular, the bands are so supportive of each other, which is really awesome. In certain fields, there's a tendency to be competitive or to one up the other person, to do bigger shows or sell more CDs. [Vancouver] is a total community.\n\nYT: Speaking of the local music community, it's been just over a year since you won the Peak Performance Project. How has that cash prize of $150,000 changed your band?\nAH: Well, I mean, it definitely opened up a lot of doors for us. Things that we couldn't do before, like, say if a tour came up, we'd really have to look at things and say, \"How many seats are we going to sell? How much is the guarantee for this show? How much is it going to cost us in gas to get up there?\" So, now we don't have to do that. Now, when opportunities come up, we can just kind of do it. You know, for the next album we don't have to necessarily sign to any particular label in hopes that they'll pay for it. In that sense, it's been so awesome to have enough money to be able to do what the band wants. Which is so cool because the band, for me, is what I want to do, so, yeah it's great.\n\nYT: Beyond the money, how else has the Peak Performance Project affected the band?\nAH: Well, positively. I would say it's given us a lot of exposure and then I'd say with everything, money or otherwise, once a band gets to a certain level, there's got to be some decisions made morally about where you want to go. So, I'd say the more exposure a band gets, or the more politics and business becomes involved, the more you have to reevaluate things. In that way it's also affected the band in that we're kind of reevaluating where we want to go with things and how much\u2026 it's kind of hard to explain\u2026 it's kind of like, how much we want to let the money affect us. Sometimes when you get a lot of money, you have to get to a point where it's like, \"OK, how do I not let this get to my head?\" So, it's like a reevaluation as well.\n\nYT: You made a video for each song on the EP with your company, Amazing Factory. As both a musician and a filmmaker how important is the music video aspect to you?\nAH: Well, I think it's really great. That's awesome that you know I'm in Amazing Factory! It's something that's really cool, especially it's something kind of different about us than other bands, that we have that mind for film. I feel like us and Amazing Factory, at the same time are kind of helping each other out. So, that's really cool that we can provide a platform for Amazing Factory and at the same time Amazing Factory really helps us out by making these awesome pieces of art for us. I just think it's so cool to have that experience, you know, where you listen to music and then you watch a video and it's not just something where you paid another company to do it. You don't just have their interpretation of it; it's very much a very cohesive, tight-knit kind of thing, which is really cool.\n\nYT: For High School, was there a conscious effort to have the videos tell a story?\nAH: Well, we just had a screening in Kelowna, so after watching those all again, it's weird. When Amazing Factory started working on them, they didn't literally interpret the songs, they did their own interpretation of it, which is great that they did that. When you watch the videos, it's a progression. The music videos aren't necessarily all connected but there are things that tie them all together. I think when you watch it, it's very much like a short film or an art piece there's very much a beginning, middle and an end. It doesn't necessarily tell a story, but it does portray some emotions and themes of the work.\n\nYT: You guys interact and share a lot with your fans through social media. How important do you think that has been in your success as a band?\nAH: I think it's so awesome. I don't know how much I owe how far we've come to the social media networks, but I will say that it's just so cool. It's something that gives everybody a fair chance, instead of before where you had to sign to a label and play a few shows before people knew about you then people could connect with you. It's kind of like everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is able to talk. Now, it's more even about answering questions and talking to people rather than just playing a show or just making good music. Which is cool, because now I think you're seeing a lot more just nice people becoming successful. If you actually have a rock star attitude or a mean way about you, then the chances of you becoming successful are actually lower which I think is actually more fair that way. I just like being able to connect with people. That's what the band is about for me, just being able to connect with people.\n\nYT: Who handles the social media accounts?\nAH: That's me. Yeah, well, actually Cayne doesn't really go near the Internet. He does on his own time, but not at the band's expense. He's not the most computer literate. There's this thing where you advance shows, so what you do is you book a show and you later send an email to find out when you're loading in, the set time and all that. He was advancing a bunch of shows\u2026 that was the duty that was given to him. He must have sent out like, five to 10 different emails to people that were wrong. They had the wrong dates on them and the wrong names and everything. One guy just emailed back and said, \"Oh, you mean this show on this date?\" Then he answered all the questions and then he said \"Who or what is a Cayne?\" That was like, the end of the line. So, after that we were like \"Cayne, look, you're a great guy but maybe this isn't your thing.\"\n\nYT: You are a young band. Do you ever feel that that has been a disadvantage?\nAH: No, if anything I feel like it might be an advantage, just because we're getting started early. The older I get the more I realize that, \"Oh, one more year and we haven't done this or that.\" Then, at the same time, that kind of falls to the wayside and I start to remember what this band and what I want my life to be about. It's not how far I make it in the music industry, it's not about how many CDs we sell, or how big of a show it is, it's more about, I guess, portraying a message or trying to live out an earnest life doing this. So, I guess at any age you can do that and I don't really feel like it's a disadvantage or an advantage. It just is.\n\nYT: If you had to describe We Are The City in three words, what words would you use?\nAH: I would say, \"progressive, alternative rock.\" That's kind of a generic way to explain it. If I could use three words to describe us as people, I would say we're, \"well-intentioned men.\" That's what I'd say"}

He's written book after book on that stuff. There're also enough books to fill a bus journey.\n\nThe video for Strong Like Bull is absolutely repulsive and terrifying. Who had that evil idea?!!\n\nTwo of my brothers make videos and websites, as wetheconspirators.com funnily enough! so they help us out with all that stuff. The video came about due to budget, we had some medals and stuff lying around, went to the market with \u00a315 and bought a heart and some fish bits, i think there was some left-over pizza in there too.

{"text":"Alex: As far as new things, Tame Impala ('Innerspeaker') was the hot summer jam while we were on tour on the West Coast. We got turned onto them by Jason Finkel, who mixed the EP. It sounds a little like Cream and Led Zeppelin meeting in the Australian Outback with psychedelic light sabers. Zac Colwell, our drummer who also produced the EP, continually turns us on to some '70s gems that we missed in our parents' vinyl collection. Also the Naked Hearts ('Mass Hysteria') who are friends of ours in Brooklyn.\n\nTell us about the first concert you ever saw and any stand-out moments. Alex: A jumble of local and world famous artists at Jazz Fest in New Orleans as a kid. One of them that jumped out was Rita Marley. I immediately wanted to dance and was energized the rest of the day.\nChris: It might have been Kenny G, with my mom. Not really high up on the \"cool\" factor, but I think I remember him holding a note for like an hour or something.\n\nWhat's your biggest vice?\nAlex: The ADD information age. Smart phones, YouTube, e-mails buzzing in your pocket all day, text messages, phone-scrabble. While we're able to do more in some ways, it's also a struggle to stay focused on whatever is right in front of you. Makes us miss the '90s in some ways.\n\nWhat's the story behind your band name?\nAlex: Chappo actually means a bunch of different things: Wandering vagabond in Hungarian; phonetically, \"to catch\" in Italian; it's close to sounding like \"hat\" in French; and El Chapo means \"shorty\" in Spanish slang. We like the reference to the moon-worshipping Nordic Gypsies that lived in Greece, late in the Dark ages. \"Chapp-owe\" was the name of the drink that they used for communion.\n\nWhen you stop making music, what's the one thing you want people to remember about you? Alex:We're pretty early in the game, and I think we'll make music for a long time, but hopefully people will remember that we were pretty well-mannered young men most of the time, and that we tipped well."}
{"text":"Brody Dalle: Spinnerette\n\nWhile fans of the Distillers and other next-generation punk bands should ultimately find this transition natural and easy to follow, Spinnerette --- the new vehicle for former Distillers lead Brody Dalle -- has a decidedly more gentle rock edge as debuted on their first release, the \"Ghetto Love EP.\"\n\nWith languid, thumping rhythms and wiggling guitar underscoring Dalle's considerably quieter but no less fierce vocals, tunes like \"Ghetto Love\" and \"Valium Knights\" are the perfect comedown to a rowdy gig from the Distillers, the soothing medication to take after amped Distillers albums like 2002's Sing Sing Death House. The first Spinnerette album, A Prescription for Mankind, will emerge in June.\n\nIn a telephone chat with SG, Dalle spoke about her current project, old musical formats, and a fresh approach to creativity in light of becoming a mother in the years since the Distillers parted ways. (She has a daughter, Camille, with her husband, Queens of the Stone Age\/Eagles of Death Metal frontman Josh Homme.) In both talent and attitude, she could be in the running for Hot Rock Mom of the Year.\n\nTamara Palmer: In the few years since you last put an album out, there have been so many changes in the music industry. Have you had to take any precautions against your album or material leaking online before you could have a chance put it out?\n\nBrody Dalle: You know what? I haven't thought about it. We haven't been particularly precious about it and I think having an attitude like that totally helps. If it happens, it happens but I haven't thought about it. You can manifest things if you get too precious and scared or if you think about something too much so I'm glad that's not been a part of my mental process, worrying about whether it's gonna leak or not. I know the Yeah Yeah Yeah's [album] did and that really sucked for them.\n\nThis is under a different name so people don't really know it. I think that's one thing that we have going for us. People are probably like, \"Who's that?\" or \"Who cares?\" if they have seen it. If it was the Distillers, there'd probably be more of a danger of that happening.\n\nTP:\n\nIt can go both ways, either by stimulating sales or by cutting into them.\n\nBD:\n\nIt used to help bands. I remember when we were on [record label] Hellcat and the Offspring album leaked. And they sold 12 million fucking records, so it didn't hurt at all, you know? That was way before the downloading thing took over, when people were excited and they'd hear [the bootleg] and then they'd go get the hard copy. Whereas now, when people have it, they have it. The ADD generation, they're just -- they're movin' on.\n\nTP:\n\nThat's what I'm afraid of, that the market for the physical product might not be the same as it used to be.\n\nBD:\n\nYeah, it's true, it's really, really unfortunate. There's so much stuff out there for people to buy, we're just getting bombarded with things. I think people just either get overwhelmed or they don't care anymore? It sounds really fucked up, but people are getting really complacent, and if they can just download songs straight to their iPod, why would they need to have this extra thing laying around unless they really are a fan or they really give a shit.\n\nTP:\n\nI feel like a dinosaur because I DJ with vinyl and I've got lots of vinyl in the house.\n\nBD:\n\nNo, that's a dying art and that's beautiful. You should just hold on to that because pretty soon -- I mean, actually, vinyl's kind of had a resurgence, I'm sure you know that.\n\nTP:\n\nIt seems like it, and right when everyone seemed like they were putting the final nail in the vinyl coffin. Are you doing any kind of vinyl?\n\nBD:\n\nYeah, of course! Yeah, we're doing a single for \"Sex Bomb\" with a remix by Adam Freeland, and that's coming out in about a month. That's kind of a special release thing that we did, and we'll definitely press up vinyl [for the album]. It's just been a long process to try and just even have this record crown itself. It's been a real uphill battle.\n\nTP:\n\nWell, you've had a lot going on as well.\n\nBD:\n\nYeah, but the changes within the industry and people being so gun shy about signing new bands or something they don't know about and people having a hard time having any faith in anything. I looked in the LA Weekly the other day and there were, like, no shows, and I was like, \"What the fuck is going on?\" I know there's a recession, but entertainment, that's a leisure.\n\nAre you finding difficulties when it comes to booking shows or are you going to tour?\n\nBD:\n\nWe're definitely gonna tour, it's just a matter of raising the profile of Spinnerette. If if it were the Distillers, it'd be no problem, we could play wherever we wanted and it'd be easy-peasy. But because it's a new band, people don't know about it, but we're going on tour for sure. It starts May 29 on the East Coast and then the record comes out. Then, we'll do the West Coast and the touring will start. Because I have a little girl, it'll be spread out.\n\nTP:\n\nThat sounds way more civilized anyway.\n\nBD:\n\nYeah, and at this point in my life, even if I didn't have Camille, I don't think I could do an eight-week tour. I think I might just go crazy.\n\nTP:\n\nThat kind of lifestyle is either for you or not for you: A different city every day for months on end.\n\nBD:\n\nYeah, have you ever toured? I know you guys do the Suicide Girls tour and perform?\n\nTP:\n\nI mean, I'm not a performing . . . [laughs]\n\nBD:\n\nYou're just the writer.\n\nTP:\n\nExactly! But I have been on the road with a band, just not for more than two or three days. I have slept in the little bunks on the tour bus before and don't understand how anyone could do that for very long.\n\nBD:\n\nBelieve me, it becomes your safe place, like, \"I just want to get to my bunk! I just want to get to my bunk.\" It's like your little haven.\n\nTP:\n\nIt's a little bit too claustrophobic for me.\n\nBD:\n\nThat's what we all thought when we first started doing it, but then it becomes your womb.\n\nTP:\n\nI can see how it could be.\n\nBD:\n\nAlso the movement -- a lot of people get car sick, but I don't have that problem so it's like being rocked to sleep.\n\nSo, since you'll be doing short stints on the road, will Camille come with you?\n\nBD:\n\nNo, not to start, not until we can build a bigger profile and enough momentum. She'll be at home with her daddy. He has a break in his touring cycle, so it works out really good.\n\nTP:\n\nWill this be the first time you have been apart from her?\n\nBD:\n\nNo, we've been apart here and there. My dad died and I was gone for four weeks, which was gnarly, but it was in Australia. That was the longest; that was pretty brutal. She was about a year old, but my husband was here and his family was there so that made a big difference. That was so intense; that's not a good example because my mind was on this awful thing. Josh and I have gone to England once for eight days, he played and it was just kind of a mummy and daddy get-away. You gotta have them. But she's been on tour; she's been on tour with Queens a couple times. She's ready to be a road dog.\n\nTP:\n\nWhat's her interest in music? Is she a rock child?\n\nBD:\n\nShe has really eclectic tastes and I think it's because we do. I'm not trying to shove anything down her throat. She picks what she likes. She loves Eagles of Death Metal, of course. Basically, she loves the stuff that she hears a lot. When we're in the process of making a record, that's what she hears all the time so she's obsessed with Spinnerette. I remember one time [Distillers\/Spinnerette guitarist] Tony [Bevilacqua] and I were driving in the car and she wouldn't let us take it out and play something else. She threw a little tantrum, it was really cute.\n\nTP:\n\nShe's probably also your own harshest critic, too.\n\nBD:\n\nTotally! She will also hear the first bar and she'll know what it is. She loves Cibo Matto actually lately. She loves the Ramones.\n\nTP:\n\nKids love the Ramones!\n\nBD:\n\nThey do! But come on, how could you not?\n\nTP:\n\nSo Spinnerette is really almost as new as having a child, or are they about the same age?\n\nBD:\n\nIt's a bit younger, we've had a couple of incarnations. It started in 2006 after Camille was born. The Distillers broke up before I got pregnant and I played with a whole bunch of people including one of my girlfriends who played bass. Tony and I would just play for hours and gather people together to start something new, and then I got pregnant and put everything on hold. As soon as Camille was born, I went over to [writing partner\/member of Eleven] Alain Johannes' house and started demo'ing. It wasn't really even spoken about; it just blossomed into this thing. One of the first songs we wrote was \"Ghetto Love\" and once we had written it, we were like, \"Wow, let's do another one!\" And onward it went and then it had a title and became this thing, and the record company wanted us to make a record so they paid for it and onward and upward, that's what happened.\n\nTP:\n\nSo you didn't cook up any musical concepts when you were pregnant, it just evolved later?\n\nBD:\n\nI mean, I did have a lot of ideas, but nothing's really come to fruition until now. It's taken a long time. There's no such thing as accidents, I don't think.\n\nTP:\n\nDid you have more to do on this project than you did on the Distillers records? It seemed like that band went through a lot of lineup changes, but you remained at the core. Did you have to handle everything yourself?\n\nBD:\n\nI was very hands-on, and if you're talking about the music part, I played everything from Wurlitzer to bass to guitar to percussion. So it's a much more musical project. It's definitely what I want to be doing and is a bit more intricate than the Distillers were. I love the Distillers, but this is really just straight-ahead, easy, not much to think about - except my lyrics, I thought about my lyrics a lot. But the music was simple. And Spinnerette is definitely shooting in a different direction."}
{"text":"Dusted Reviews\n\nMy first listen of Superchunk's new album in nine years, Majesty Shredding, incited a feeling best described as moral outrage, a feeling completely out of proportion with what what an indie rock album warranted. Shredding isn't an archival recording of S.S. marching songs, so why was I so offended on a moral\/aesthetic level? This first reaction is interesting to examine because I think it's more telling than my eventual stance \u2014 I enjoy the album. Not as much as their others, and on the whole, I think it's more disposable, less personal, more broad than their other work, but still enjoyable.\n\nIn my review of their No Pocky for Kitty and On the Mouth reissues, I wrote that Superchunk's fantastic hooks \u2014 both the vocal and instrumental variety \u2014 set them apart and that Mac is an overly earnest lyric writer, a strategy that, while sometimes leading to silliness, often works because he'll hit on real, affecting emotional truths. And what carries the band through the sillier lyrics is their incredibly ability to write a hook that not simply distracts the listeners, but that tends to infuse those silly moments with true emotion. Superchunk is essentially a band incredibly skilled at merging emotional honesty with a gut-level pop sensibility, hitting the listener on every level \u2014 lizard brain and rational consciousness.\n\nWhile I like all of their albums, my real wheelhouse is Foolish to Come Pick Me Up (though I appreciate and enjoy where they were going on Here's to Shutting Up). But in that span of albums, they took the energy and effusiveness of their earlier albums and married to a more dynamic quality. Jon Wurster's drumming became more interesting without ever giving up its power, the hooks became more complicated without ever giving up their catchiness, and there wasn't a reliance on power chords to drive the songs. McCaughn became comfortable opening up and being more honest, and in general, this run of albums is strong from start to finish.\n\nWhen Majesty Shredding was announced, I was elated. Superchunk are one of my favorite bands for the above reasons. The musical landscape is filled with mostly mediocre songwriting, irritating and frustratingly tiresome chord progressions, and generally a background mood of tedium that lies behind Myspace and Soundcloud and Bandcamp, so I look especially to this kind of music to do something for me, to break through the logical layers of rationality, so I can say, \"Oh, right, that's what emotions are.\" So in my mind, a new Superchunk album was a chance for a new or a re- articulation.\n\nBut all I did was press fast-forward, track after track. When that expectation of emotional articulation wasn't met, it brought up that feeling of outrage, as if somehow Superchunk let me down. They did not.\n\nThat's the problem I encountered \u2014 expectation had framed my listening experience. It's been nine years since the last Superchunk album, and what I expected was a continuation or a response in some way to Shutting Up. That's, generally, a fairly honest way of understanding a band or an artist \u2014 how do songs play off against each other, how do albums and side projects and the like respond to each other, i.e., what is the progression?\n\nNine years is a long time though, and in reality, this is more the continuation of McCaughan's work in his solo venture Portastatic than it is a Superchunk album proper. While Wurster's drumming is fantastic, the band's dynamic as a whole is askew. Laura Balance and Jim Wilbur feel like they're missing, and the balance as a whole is tipped in McCaughan's favor: solos over hooks, bland vocal melodies designed more around the rhythm of the lyrics, the absence of interesting chord progressions and codas. This has been the problem with all the post-The Nature of Sap Portastatic albums as well. I somewhat blame McCaughan's apparent fascination with Bruce Springsteen, though it could just be getting older, having a family or any other host of reasons.\n\nSap was interesting and creative, meaningful and catchy and then Summer of the Shark began a series of albums that aren't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but are lacking a real inspired spark. There's always at least one dynamic song like \"Sour Shores,\" but then the albums tend to just be a series of fun, uninspired songs, lacking major hooks and not really being that affecting. This is essentially Majesty Shredding. Songs that don't sound like Portastatic still feel drained of inspiration, like that band is going through the motions. I'm happy they're still producing albums for sure, but one has to wonder why they decided, after nine years, to get back together if there wasn't a real need driving them. Shredding feels more like a shrug and a \"Why not?\" than it does the result of having to make this music. Certainly, there are dynamic songs like \"My Gap Feels Weird\" and good hooks like \"Rosemarie,\" but overall, that shrug is pervasive."}

{"text":"Veins\n\nMt.Wolf-Veins\n\nThough it caught me a bit off guard, listening to the vaporous and tranquil sounds of London's Mt.Wolf proved to be an absolutely breathtaking experience right from the beginning. As I became more familiar with each track on their upcoming Hypolight EP, their silky, folk laced, dream pop sound steadily became more and more adorned with a distinctive, celestial atmosphere. Being the first track that I heard, \"Veins\" definitely stuck out in all of the right ways with it's elusive yet delicate nature, but that's not to say that the other three songs don't hold their own. Hypolight offers a sense of reflection throughout it's entire duration and it deserves to be consumed as a whole time and time again.

{"text":"Grimes\n\nVisions\n\n4AD \/ Arbutus\n\nThe third release by Montreal indie auteur Claire Boucher, a.k.a. Grimes, keeps floating away. Boucher, who cooked up this music in her bedroom using GarageBand, is full of interesting rhythmic and melodic ideas. At its finest, in songs like \"Vowels = space and time\" and the sumptuous ballad \"Skin,\" Visions is like Etsy Timbaland: catchy, eerily minimalist electro soul, poked and prodded by unsettling beats. But Boucher's voice is all airy top end: She sounds like the cross between a J-pop pipsqueak and Alvin and the Chipmunks. It's an irksome, sometimes shrill sound; often, her lyrics are unintelligible. The result is an emptiness at the center of the record: Grimes isn't spooky enough to be \"ghostly,\" and not substantial enough to hold your attention"}

I heard really good things about it...\n\nIt was good. It was really fun. It was a good stage and the crowd seemed more animated then Melbourne.\n\nIt's that vibe where they like it but cross their arms and they're like 'we're not going to let you know'.\n\nThat's Portland!\n\nI've been watching a lot of Portlandia lately, how accurate is it?\n\nWell it's accurate, it's parody so it's amplifying things that exist in Portland. Why do you guys watch it? We've had people ask us about it.\n\nIt just came on TV, it just started showing in its first season.\n\nWell Brian was in the first episode. We've had a lot of friends that have been it.\n\nOh were you? What were you doing on it?\n\nIn the library doing hide and seek. I feel lucky that I got in the first episode because that's the one that everyone watches\u2026 And then they stop watching it after they see what it's about. No one in Portland watches TV anyway.\n\nThere seems like a great music scene there, like you and the Decemberists, what is the scene like?\n\nIt's us and the Decemberists, that's it. There's probably a thousand bands. There's bands on every level... Modest Mouse\u2026some huge bands\u2026Wildfire too. There's a least a hundred venues too so if you want a gig it's easy. It's good for bands starting out. We play there like once a year maybe.\n\nHow often do you get to be home these days?\n\nMaybe half a year. Well the last year and a half we hardly toured at all, so it just depends.\n\nWell you guys have cranked out a lot of music over the last few years, two albums in the last two years. Six albums in, how are you feeling about the music? It's the first time you guys let other people into the process, how did that change things?\n\nIt's always good to get other people on things but I don't want to think about it too much.\n\nI got sent the album last year and it feels like a progression. Where do you go from here (in terms of music)?\n\nThe music, I'm sure it will progress but I don't think there is any plan. I just approach it like song writing not like 'we're going to do this'.\n\nDo you write anywhere but home?\n\nNo, not really\u2026\n\nDo you think you could?\n\nI don't set out to write songs to be honest, I write a whole album. When I start writing songs I just write them. It's hard when you're touring to have energy to do anything except perform well and get to where you're meant to be. A large amount of time is taken up with driving ourselves around and then when we get to where we are we work till really late and get up in the morning and do it again. There just isn't a lot of time and there aren't hours and hours of empty blocks of time to get into it.\n\nSo how many times have you been down here (in Australia) now?\n\nThis is our second time. Contrary to popular opinion.\n\nIt's only your second time? I thought you guys were here more recently?\n\nIt's been written that way but it's not true. We were here in 2009 and this is the next time.\n\nWell it's good to see you guys back now and the thing to plug here is you have a seven inch coming out on Record Store Day?\n\nYeah! You guys have Record Store Day here?\n\nYeah, travels around and we'll probably get two record stores that will get two records of your yellow label vinyl.\n\nSo get it while you can!\n\nDo you guys have any control on what happens on Record Store Day?\n\nYeah we say 'here are some songs', and in the States there seems to be a lot of people that collect vinyl and they always seem to sell out really fast.\n\nIt's good beer money\u2026\n\nWell we don't see any of that! But it's good promo. It's a fetish item.\n\nHow do you feel your music sounds on vinyl, do you prefer your sound on vinyl.\n\nYeah sounds good. Sounds better usually. I'm usually so involved with the initial product and mixing I don't really listen to that.\n\nDid you back of a little bit with the mixing on this record?\n\nYeah well he was in Wales and every night he would send be a little bit and I'd put in my input.\n\nThat was Chad Blake? He's been doing it for awhile...\n\nHe was good, fun to work with.\n\nFor the next record do you think you will bring other people on board again?\n\nYeah I will probably have someone mix it, I like doing that.\n\nWell we can't wait to hear what comes next, how much longer have you got on the road?\n\nWe'll have little breaks throughout the year but it will be busy.\n\nYou've come at a good time, your friend Dawes is here too\u2026 are getting to see any other bands while you're here?\n\nYeah whatever we can catch. But I don't really know much of the bands besides some of the big ones. I'll try to catch Justin Townes Earle later in the night. We saw him over in Perth. He's good. I'll probably retire back to the hotel!\n\nWell wish you all the best while you're here, thanks for taking the time!"}

One side of it is the deep, intense sinister and gloomy mood that shines on through all the songs, in some of it's most intense moments particularly Petri Hannus' lead vocals are just manic. The other side are the catchy hook-lines always present in even the darkest moments. Melody-lines that won't let go.\n\nThis Product was added to our catalogue on Saturday, 27.

{"text":"Review:\nThere's something strangely dream-like about this self-titled cut from the mysterious Counterfeit. At times, the teary-eyed vocal does a good impression of Peter Gabriel circa \"Mercy Street\" (from the So album, fact fans), while the bubbling, melancholic backdrop - Germanic deep house with bittersweet synth-pop touches - sounds like something the Pet Shop Boys would have made circa Behaviour, had Solomun been producing them rather than Harold Faltermeyer. While this all might sound a bit odd, but it's actually rather lovely, coming on like a laidback version of Benoit & Sergio - which, in our book at least, is a very good thing."}
{"text":"COUGAR LEGS\n\nBio\n\nCougar Legs are strong and sadistic. They are lengthy and polar. They come clean and they come dirty. They walk on carpets and sand and they run in the fields of sour apples. They camouflage themselves in the sun and hunt at midnight. They prowl the darkest corners of the earth, but salivate over simple delights. Take them in your home and breed with them.\n\nDave Kurtz and Joshua Trinidad opened the show as Cougar Legs, with the former performing arhythmic jazz percussion in masterful time with the latter's doleful trumpet playing. With the horn looped and drawn out with languorous delays, Trinidad harmonized with himself and manipulated the texture and tempo of the layers of sound he generated. The effect, coupled with Kurtz's strong yet finely syncopated performance, evoked dark, lounge music that could have served as an alternate soundtrack to the movie Blade Runner, had Vangelis been more into bebop than modern classical."}

E\u00d8: I want to encourage people NOT to bring big cameras if you plan on being close to the stage. We prefer excited dancers up front. Our show is not a \"show.\" It is not a DVD that we play back. It's very dependent on the interaction with the audience. If the audience is boring, then the band will be boring, too.\n\nHK: What's the best and worst thing about being on tour? E\u00d8: New places, new people, new food, new audiences, new energy, challenges, work to do, the feeling of doing something meaningful, playing our songs. Bad: Queuing at airports. And all the people asking for a \"picture with you.\" Nobody wants to talk to us anymore. All they want is \"picture with you.\" Of course I wouldn't mind if it were one or two, but there is no such thing as one or two, it's either zero or 50.\n\nHK: What's the weirdest place you've performed at?

{"text":"Wednesday, February 22, 2012\n\nLeft of Center\n\nThe handful of lyricists involved in the '67 triumvirate we have been discussing were writing satires and critiques of the then-nascent counterculture, and these satires and critiques were aimed at the center of said counterculture. Elders in the West would've liked for the counterculture to remain marginal, but by '67 it was massive enough (backed by the Baby Boomers' demographics) that it was impossible to ignore. What was counterculture, taken to the nth? What types of characters dwelt in the margins of the counterculture? In New York, Pop-Art icon Andy Warhol was bypassing the countercultural center and making movies employing the junkies, speed freaks, transvestites, and deviant fetishists who were too left even for the left- marginal characters leading extreme lives. Warhol's protege Lou Reed produced a cache of songs in '67 which reflected similar concerns. The characters who populate The Velvet Underground and Nico have an inverse relationship to the Beatles' Everyman who dominates Sgt. Pepper- Reed's characters, like Jean Genet's, manifest extreme Otherness. To add \"Heroin\" as a centerpiece to the triumvirate of centerpieces I have already erected (\"A Day in the Life,\" \"2000 Light Years from Home,\" \"When the Music's Over\"), is to flip a bunch of positions at once. \"Heroin,\" lyrically, is a dramatic monologue in the first person- it is the closest rock has ever come to Hamlet's \"To be or not to be\" soliloquy. Rather than being crushed by banality because he is part of it, as in the Beatles, Reed's protagonist rebels against banality by crucifying himself on the cross of his drug.\n\nThe dynamic between \"Heroin\" and the Stones is even more intriguing- Reed's subject owns his own loneliness, is fully cognizant of the destructiveness of the society he lives in and is staging a conscious rebellion. He may be alienated, but in his self-possession he is certainly \"home.\" It's his marginal position which allows him to see his society so clearly- what's visible from the outside in isn't necessarily visible from the inside, and if you're seeing clearly there's no chance to fly off into space. The Doors and the Velvets back and forth set up a dynamic between a personal and a generalized apocalypse- Reed grants Morrison's digressions a concrete center. Reed's protagonist talks from inside \"What've they done to the Earth\/ What've they done to our fair sister?\" The rebellion enacted in \"Heroin\" is against destruction with more destruction- the degradation of the protagonist's body is a manner of elevating his soul. It's the spiritual trumping the material, and the act of ingesting heroin (which is rendered dramatically in the rise and fall of the music) a manifestation of courage and heroism, just as the Beatles' Everyman cowers behind routinized behaviors and the Stones' space cadets pretend to be enjoying their trips. The irony is that we don't have to grant Reed's protagonist the premise he presents- we can interrogate whether or not we find him to be courageous for injecting heroin. What if we find him to be merely narcissistic? He wants us to believe it's more transcendental (and spiritual) not to care, to disengage or not even register \"the dead bodies piled up in mounds,\" to \"nullify (his) life.\"\n\nLiving on the margins is a double-edged sword- you get to see the massive and imposing center more clearly, but what (and who) sustains you? What's your community? There is no \"you\" to the \"I\" in \"Heroin\"; but the \"you\" is there in the background, and Reed's audience was (and is) encouraged to put together the clues as to how this particular Hamlet became this haunted. It would be difficult to read \"Heroin\" as a satire- the lyrics are presented in deadly earnest, and we are encouraged to sympathize with the protagonist. In many ways, it's the warmest of the four centerpieces, and the most human. That's a distinguishing characteristic of Lou Reed's writing, right up until the present day and against Jagger, Morrison, and Lennon-McCartney- his characters breathe, they have an emotional life. Other songs on The Velvet Underground and Nico, like \"I'll Be Your Mirror,\" represent the joy of simple (and complex) human connection in a way that eludes the Beatles, Stones, and Doors. It's an interesting conglomerate of sensibilities- marginal characters leading lives on-edge, but still able to relate, rather than alienated center-dwellers. The fact that male and female voices alternate on the album adds a sense of androgyny to the songs- it could be glossed as simple bisexuality (as if bisexuality were ever simple) or an enactment of the communal impulse that the Beatles, Stones, and Doors skewer.\n\nIt's another irony that's difficult to steer around- that margin-dwellers are capable of maintaining closer relationships than centrists. One reason that the deviant sex of \"Venus in Furs\" is so evocative is that the roles participants play in S & M scenarios are intimate. If \"Venus in Furs\" didn't sound so intimate (and distinctive, owing to John Cale's contribution), it would be merely imposing and eerie. As is, it's also touching. There's a whole history of this kind of literature- the intimacy of marginality and transgression. But before Lou Reed and the Velvets, there'd never been anything in popular music quite like this. In a sense, the Velvets rebelled against the timeliness of the Beatles, Stones, and Doors with timelessness- naked portraits of human essences rendered in such a way that they aren't limited by the confines of '67"}
{"text":"Robbie Robertson Presents: How to Score an Audio Movie\n\nMany Clairvoyant songs talk about you being in motion: You're on a train, you're transitioning through different phases, you're reconciling certain things in your life. And since you've always been a visually oriented songwriter, I feel like I'm \"watching\" these songs unfold as I listen to them.\n\nI'm glad they came across that way, because I'm also drawn to that in other people's work. It has a lot to do with my connection to films over all these years. I'm painting pictures here. Sometimes the treatment of certain songs has to do more with scoring them, as opposed to just accompanying them.\n\nDid you think of your specific guest collaborators as you were writing the songs? For example, were you thinking that the title track would be right for pedal-steel guitarist Robert Randolph or that \"Axman\" would be good for a raging Tom Morello guitar solo? Or did those ideas evolve organically?\n\nThey did evolve organically. In the same way a scene in a movie tells you what it needs more than you can predict what it needs, these songs were revealing themselves as I was writing and discovering them. That helped lead me in the right direction and to the players.\n\nThis album is an audio movie, for sure.\n\nYes. This is a real Sound + Vision record! [both laugh]\n\nA good example of your \"scoring\" concept has to be \"Madame X,\" a track where Trent Reznor provides what you describe in the credits as \"additional textures.\" But first, I have to ask: Is the song title a callback to the character in \"Somewhere Down the crazy River\" [from 1987's RobbieRobertson]?\n\nYou're the first person who's mentioned this to me. It was just an accident that it ended up with that title. It was something between Eric Clapton [who wrote the song] and myself that we ended up calling this \"Madame X,\" and it wasn't until after the fact that I realized I had used a character called Madam X in \"Somewhere Down the Crazy River.\" [She's cited in the lines, \"You know, I think I'm gonna go down to Madam X \/ And let her read my mind.\"] So it just goes to show you: You can't escape your past.\n\nAs to the \"additional textures,\" I think it was about getting the thematic part of this song right \u2014 balancing its traditional, acoustic sense with the counterpoint of that very dusky sound. And I couldn't imagine anybody doing it better than Trent, because he has a strong cinematic connection. It was a beautiful collaboration, so I guess it was good casting on my part.\n\nI'd love to hear \"Madame X\" in surround sound, because there are so many layers to the recording.\n\nThat's a very interesting idea. \"Madame X\" seems like the kind of song that will find itself in a movie at some point, and when it does, I'm going to recommend that it be done that way"}
{"text":"JMSN, aka Christian Berishaj, is the mastermind behind the album \u2020Priscilla\u2020, released back in January. It's obvious that this guy is fearless and maybe even somewhat conceited considering the various voicemails that he sampled on this album. There's a black sheep vibe within this record that many of you can probably relate to.\n\n\u2020Priscilla\u2020 takes on a large mix of genres and techniques. There's a huge emphasis on eerie orchestral strings and classic R&B tempos which, in my opinion, is a hypnotizing combination. At certain points the album projects a spiritual conflict between good and evil, and the everyday struggles of a person who just can't get their shit together. The only difference between Christian and the rest of those people is that Christian shamelessly took those flaws and made an artistic masterpiece out of them in the form of this album. That's what makes this album so relatable; we all fuck up, but some or most of us don't want to own up to it \u2014 this album basically airs it all out for you.\n\nThere's a ton of different sampling effects throughout this entire 16-track album, which adds a touch of psychedelia to its dark and haunting vibe. The vocals are drenched in sorrow and hopefulness and other times helplessness. Either way, they're gorgeous. The layers are luscious and tasteful and there's never a dull moment; this album has a song for everyone. To sum it up, this album tends to be kind of heart wrenching but at the same time, it has the potential to draw you in due to its pop sensibility. To top it all off, Christian wrote and produced this entire album by himself.\n\nJMSN is cut from the cloth of innovative path-whackers that aren't afraid to take the reigns and push the envelope.

But you're never confronted with your garbage, unless, you know, you drive out to the dump on a regular basis, but a large percent of our population doesn't do that.\n\nAre environmental issues important to you?\n\nYeah, I think so just as a human on the planet. Having kids now, I feel responsible for my daughters. I really got into planting this weekend with them. I just remembered my grandma passing on some good ideas when I was a kid and you remember that when you become a parent. Like, there's stuff I've got to do so my kids aren't idiots!\n\nWith the theme of the album pertaining to an idea like consumption and how much we consume nowadays, do you feel pressure to constantly put out music in order to keep people happy?\n\nYes and no. I mean, sometimes I feel really stressed out about that and people always want to hear the hundreds of songs and in some ways they're just sitting here, rotting. But they're not really that good and I don't want to flood my potential audience with mediocre stuff. With Black Mold, the ambient stuff seems to be a bit easier and I wouldn't feel so bad about releasing hours and hours of that to listen to in the background while they, I don't know, whatever people do these days, play online games.\n\nWatch Chad VanGaalen's Video for 'Peace on the Rise'\n\nHow much does the opinions of others factor into your music?\n\nI have the good fortune of being close to a lot of people that I can bounce stuff off of. Usually, I'm not really good at picking what meshes well together; that was the failure of the first few records. So I just threw stuff at people and they were like, \"Yeah, the record's coming together! It sounds like a record!\" and I'd go, \"Oh, OK. Yeah it does,\" and just pretend like I know what I'm doing. My wife Sara is probably the only person that I'm kind of indoctrinating with sound on a daily basis -- but she's definitely no music aficionado which makes it perfect for someone's honest opinion.\n\nThat song wasn't supposed to be on the record at first and then everybody liked it and I felt really weird about it. She didn't really feel that weird to begin with.\n\nWhy did you feel weird about it?\n\nLyrically, I try to keep stuff sort of fairly, not distant from myself personally, but a little more accessible emotionally for people listening. I really don't like to get political or introspectively too far in there with the lyrical content ... Does that make sense? I like people to have access to the lyrics for themselves and not necessarily be pushed too far in a direction.\n\nAre you happy with 'Diaper Island'?\n\nYou're never really happy.

Hayman's ethereal guitar work merged with Cuba's complex rhythms and melodies to create a totally unique sound. Alicia Healey joined them on bass and vocals and coaxed Eileen into the studio, producing and engineering Eileen's 2003 EP \"If\".\n\nWith the 2007 summer release of her second CD, \"Simple Geometry\", Eileen's music is sinking more solidly into the alternative folk\/rock music genre, taking advantage of drums and bass to give her rhythms and chordal melodies the background they have always yearned for. Produced and engineered by Johnny Sangster, the album features her collaboration with the very talented Peter Langston. Other musicians include Alicia Healey, Mark Pickerel, Jim Sangster, Johnny Sangster, and Paul Elliott.\n\nWhat others are saying...\n\n\"Eileen's fearlessly distilled lyrics and exhilarating guitar find a jungle of sounds with Peter Langston. Sudden turns, musical adventure, not for the timid. Advanced ears take note, this is a cd worth a real listening date, embraced by excellent headphones, lyric booklet propped open, hungry for all the nuances. Enjoy the feast!!!\" long-time fan Kristina Olsen, (and international touring musician)\n\n\"What is Eileen's Cuba's Simple Geometry? A) Rock and Roll. B) Folk C) Beatific Underworld Rhythm and Blues D) All of the Above The answer is D). But to get a little more descriptive... Start with Eileen's guitar chord progressions. No more like Trigometric patterns. Then add vocals and lyrics as if Joni Mitchell had emerged out of late 70s Punk rather than 60s Folk and then took 30 years off to study Soul Physics in another galaxy and returned with a microscope in one eye and a telescope in the other and subterranean homesick messages of the heart, and accompanied by a band of other worldly heroes who had absorbed all there is to know of Chuck Berry, X, Nirvana, The Ronettes, psychedelic jug music, and angelic choirs. With Peter Langston firing as many stringed weapons he could get his hands on and producer Johnny Sangster shooting pop-rockets into unlikely places in the sub-atomic mix, this is an album that you might not know that you want, but it is what you need.\" Ed Schneider\n\n\"Cuba's songs play like beautiful indie film dreamscapes. Simple Geometry is a kaleidoscope of ferocious desire, fragile pain, simple joy, and some delicious trips to the edge. The colors and shapes rearrange incredibly between cuts. Langston's bold guitar work is a terrific addition to Cuba's rhythms, adding depth and a just right, off-kilter David Byrne sensibility. My favorites: New Math, Blue Bird, Too Close, Touchtaptwisttremble, and Frozen; which never ceases to make me cry. And you gotta love a line like: \"I close my eyes when I drive, but only at night, and only on 5\" (Truth or Dare). The songs get deeper with every listen, so listen closely and repeatedly, and be prepared to experience life through Cuba's fearless, wide open senses.\" Lee, CD Baby"}
{"text":"BAND CRUSH: PHONY PPL\n\nSomewhere in the Bed-Stuy there's a house called Casa de la Phony where the Brooklyn-based nine-piece band that is Phony Ppl reside and are starting their own mini music revolution. Not all nine members technically live at the casa--it belongs to DJ Jazzy Jay whose son Maff Yuu, is a founding member of Phony PPL--but \"it's where it all goes down and they've all got clothes there,\" Maff Yuu explained. Remember these faces (well, the ones that aren't covered by a gasmask) because this band is on the verge of taking off. They've already opened for and performed with an array of major artists spanning across multiple genres including Erykah Badu, Roots, Theophilus London, Miguel, and The Internet, which is pretty impressive for a group of 19-21 year-olds that met in high school. They joke that they met on the Internet. \"E-harmony?\" I asked. \"No, Blackpeoplemeet.com.\"\n\nHow does a band go from high school performances to opening for The Roots? In the case of Pony Ppl, it's how much they play, but more so how much they care about making music. Their music is a soulful mix of part hip-hop, part R&B, that's influenced by jazz, and heavily influenced by the '70s, '80s, and '90s (Jazzy Jay made sure of that). Since that classification is too long and somewhat broad, the group took to giving their brand of music a name of its own--that name being Brooklyn Soul. One of the band's leads, Elbee Thrie, explained how all nine members respectively invented their own genre. \"Brooklyn Soul is actually a genre that we came up with ourselves. We were playing music for awhile. We turned off the instruments and started talking about where the music came from. The word soul is very important. Soul is the most influential word of our genre. We've been doing this for so long that it's natural to us. I would hate to keep going through the rest of our lives and not knowing what to say when people ask what kind of music we make. This is our experience, who we are--our music is our souls,\" Elbie Thrie says, \"It's influenced by the people that we know, the people that we are, the accents we have, the people that live across the street, the architecture, the color schemes of the city, the slang, and how we dress. As you travel throughout Brooklyn, you'll find different cultures. Our Brooklyn culture is nine very different individuals. Phony PPL is like a new culture.\"\n\nPhony Ppl may have created their own genre and their own culture, but their music pays homage to the generations of artists that came before them. \"Don't only be influenced 100% by what is happening now because you need to understand the past before you can understand the future,\" Maff Yuu explained. \"Before you can create the future,\" Sheriff PJ corrected. \"Excuse me, create the future,\" says Maff Yuu, \"We take from everyone: Europe, Africa--you can be from anywhere and we'll listen to it and have it relate to what we do.\"\n\nWhat sets them apart isn't only the band's unique sound--they're smart enough to distance themselves from everything that's wrong about the way new artists emerge today. \"The magnifying glass is in the wrong area. And that's what people are gravitating towards,\" says Sheriff PJ. Aja adds, \"Being a musician is more accessible now due to technology. And now it's all about the visuals. I think that Phony Ppl brings back that music element that's not just about the way things look. If it was my choice, no one would even have to see us. I want the music to speak for itself.\"\n\n\"We bring a different outlook to music. It's that old-school instrumental sound in a world that's very digital. It's Brooklyn soul.\" If you're still not exactly sure what Brooklyn Soul is, watch their new video for \"I Wish I Was a Chair\"or since the band's would say, \"it's not all about the visuals\" you can listen to all of their music right here.\n\nBut if you really want to get a good visual, just use your imagination like the band does to make music everyday. Picture them sitting in their Bed-Stuy basement making beats, being fly, and looking fly. \"It's about the music, but you gotta be fly. We're from Brooklyn and people from Brooklyn is not, not fly.\" Or better yet, watch them live at Brooklyn Bowl on February 21st."}
{"text":"Dusted Reviews\n\n\"The Art of Letting Go\" is Save The World's second track and first real song. Equal parts goofy energy and stoic reserve, it's as good a summary of this collaboration between Michael Mayer and Superpitcher as one could hope for. Mayer and Superpitcher (Christian name Aksel Schaufler) have been a major force in shaping contemporary house and techno music through the conduit of the Cologne-based Kompakt label, which Mayer runs. Music fans with only a passing knowledge of or interest in electronic music are likely familiar with the label via its consistent design philosophy: its penchant for retro-futurist, largely non-representational artwork gives the impression of a unitary brand, one whose signees aren't so much artists as an expedience for transmitting ideas lodged in the label itself. So when, after the squelchy, illegible intro of \"Hey!,\" a \"Billie Jean\" aping beat announces the real start of the album, the collaboration might pass, albeit momentarily, for something like Map of Africa.\n\nIt's not a huge surprise, even for a label staked on a deep, implied groove rather than the familiar catharsis of rock; still, it's a calibration, and a deliberate and openly strategic one at that. The idea of Kompakt as a overcoding entity is pretty far from the truth, but does go a certain distance in explaining why it took half a decade for the label, or the glitch-scarred and consistently innovative form of techno that it has become synonymous with, to gain the pitch of critical admiration and subsequent backlash that, for the past decade or so, has been pretty much de rigueur for anything that feels new. The song's bass, in the context of the label's oeuvre, can only be described as \"intensely fretted,\" its unsynth bleed emphasized by an epic hammer-on bridge. This is to say nothing of the lyrics, which tell the kind of story that can only be rendered in two lines: \"Let's get to it, alright, let me go,\" goes the smarmy first half, echoed in the second by a ghostly, desperate incantation of the song's title. The attention that the voice commands is deployed deliberately here as on the album's only other narrative, vocal track, the woozy, mythlike \"The Lonesome King.\" The same formal, architectural impulse inhabits these compositions as well as the more gradual construction and subtraction of tracks like the casually gorgeous \"Please Sunrise.\" Still essentially narrative, the structure is the story: it's Neu!'s \"Leb'wohl\" melted down and smuggled into Ibiza. \"The Lonesome King\" is likewise bathed in corrupted, nostalgic light. But while the pleasure of \"Please Sunrise\" is the unaccounted-for remainder of the track's transitions between compositional elements, \"The Lonesome King\" is a productive attempt to cram as much unexpected instrumentation (saxophone, trumpet, flute, and melodica, to begin with) into a song form that, unlike much Kompakt material, doesn't make up its own rules as it goes along.\n\nThe album, taken as a whole, is less of a departure than it may lead us to believe. The deflated faces that adorn the superheroes' chests are as good an indicator as the music \u2013 SuperMayer's not just puncturing the idea of supergroup or of Kompakt-as-brand; they're very openly draining out self-seriousness in a tongue-in-cheek attempt to court and bait an audience that's beginning to take a more specific interest in them, an audience whose first musical language is indie. It's also a critical feint that's designed, at least in part, to underline the fact that Kompakt and its artists straddle several big musical fault lines. By the time you reach the end of the album, though, you'll be convinced you were overthinking it: \"Cocktails for Two\" screams class like red wine, Steely Dan, and early '90s R&B. A heavy red velvet curtain cast down, the duo slip out the back door of their own scenario relatively unnoticed."}

{"text":"The Kudzu Kings' hybrid country takes root across America.\n\nThankfully, the band leavens its approach with humor and on-stage shtick, which has helped the group gain ground across the South. \"We're like a damn comedy routine,\" Moore says. \"We've developed this rapport on stage; we're like Laurel and Hardy between songs. I have so many people ask for bootlegs that say, 'Man, please don't take out the stuff between songs.' It's entertainment, and it goes a long way.\"\n\nDespite this goofiness, Moore says the band has been lumped into the same camp as bands like critical darlings Wilco and Son Volt. He makes it clear he doesn't think he and his pals belong there.\n\nThe Kudzu Kings' humorous blend of humor and high-level playing is slowly taking over the South.\n\nMore About\n\n\"A lot of those bands take themselves too seriously,\" he says, \"and everything is so depressing.\"\n\n\"We're not terribly serious, that's for sure,\" Woolworth says. \"When you write songs, it's like an approach to life: You take the good with the bad, and hopefully, you can convey it all and still laugh about it in the end. The idea is to loosen it up.\"\n\nThat's something the Kings do nicely, and their sound is a welcome dose of greenery in the sometimes bland, browned-out genres they so adroitly straddle. That the band's catalogue is being welcomed across their homeland is making the group's name that much more appropriate.\n\n\"Let me put it to you this way,\" Woolworth says of his band's kudzu kinship. \"If you look at where we started and where we spread to, it's a natural connection. We've been south and east, but not very far north, because it's not a very hospitable climate. But where it's hospitable for kudzu to grow, you can find the Kudzu Kings, too.

{"text":"Review:\n\nThe title of Philly indie punk band Glocca Morra's new album Just Married seems intentionally ironic. Most songs share the overarching theme of getting, in the writer's words, \"fucked over\" in relationships and dealing with disillusionment and loneliness as a result. It's notable that the first word the vocalist utters is fuck -- despite a sprinkling of cliched similes and metaphors, the lyrics draw from a limited, repetitive, and often vulgar vocabulary. For this reason, each song sounds like it could be written as a self-absorbed paragraph in a teenager's diary. This might disappoint listeners looking for something more poetic, but the immaturity and simplicity of the lyrics may resonate with the middle and high school crowd.\n\nA whiny, self-serious vocalist would have made Just Married an unbearable listening experience. Fortunately, the singer uses a raw, unaffected tone, giving each track an honest and believable quality. When he escalates into screaming, it adds energy and a bit of needed silliness to an otherwise bleaker theme.\n\nSophisticated, '90s grunge-style guitar riffs and a consistently upbeat tempo add a refreshing contrast to the lyrics. As is common in the indie genre, the melodies wander around with no chorus to return to, and most of the songs blend together. I had trouble telling the songs apart, even after repeated listens. One stand-out exception is \"Me + Geniene.\" The subtle horns on this track bring back memories of Neutral Milk Hotel, and the satirical emergency phone call recording adds amusing black humor as the album draws to a close."}
{"text":"Roman&Alaina are an indie folk\/pop duo whose catchy melodies and tight two-part harmonies makes them stand out in the crowd. You could try to put their sound in a box, but it's just not possible \u2013 when you have a listen, you'll know what I mean.\n\nPerhaps this duo is hard to label because they each have such a diverse mix of musical influences ranging from jazz and funk, to country, acoustic folk, and most everything in between. Or perhaps it's because it's hard to label people that just don't stand still for long.\n\nRoman grew up in Seattle and Alaina is from the musical epicenter Toronto, Ontario and when not touring through their two countries, they occasionally pick a city to call home. They recently decided that Los Angeles was under populated with musicians and decided to move to CA to record their new release, \"Last Forest in the City\" (2011) produced by Drew Allsbrook.\n\nPeppy melodies that include a beautiful blend of instruments leave you hanging at the end of every song to hear what comes next. The lyrics are real, and discuss the beauty in the ups and downs of life.\n\nRoman&Alaina's vocal blend suggest a singing\/songwriting duo that actually likes each other, and indeed, after flirting around some fancy microphones in Nashville, TN the two instantly started writing and recording together and soon got married. They shamelessly sang their own songs at their wedding, and shortly after the honeymoon they released their debut album, \"Sounds of Prayer,\" (2008), produced by recording veteran Leonardo Bella.\n\nRoman&Alaina released \"Last Forest in the City\" in November 2011 while backpacking in Israel, It's a groovy roller coaster folk\/pop record and the theme is primarily about growing pains, pleasures, and of course insights into what others call their \"cute and quirky marriage\". The couple is now back in L.A promoting this new release and writing for their next project."}

{"text":"Fruit Bats\n\nThe Ruminant Band\n\n(Sub Pop)\n\nThe opening track of The Ruminant Band, \"Primitive Man,\" is anything but. Using a sophisticated waltz-like strumming progression the Fruit Bats start their fourth album with a quiet melody before launching into the album's title track. Having much of their lineage shared and intersected with indie faves The Shins there are moments on the album that seem to have soaked their influence into the fibers of the new tracks, such as \"Tegucigalpa,\" which is the capital city of Honduras, a country that happens to be home of many actual Fruit Bats.\n\n\"Beautiful Morning Light\" slows the pace down and strips the band bare, spending several minutes reflecting on the sunrise, before \"The Hobo Girl\" chimes in with a song best suited to a late night bar. The chorus bleeds together, sounding like a bunch of distorted drunks loosely singing and having a good time, before giving way to unintelligible ramblings. \"Being on Our Own\" sounds like a corrected version of \"The Hobo Girl,\" using a similar piano chord progression and clean vocal recordings to deliver a cleaner, intelligible version of its predecessor, although to be fair the songs are different enough to be distinguishable from each other.\n\n\"My Unusual Friend\" is the plateau moment of the album where the band seems to start losing some steam and perhaps running out of ideas. A common problem with hundreds of albums each year, the Fruit Bats shake it off like a passing train, and emerge with \"Singing Joy to the World,\" a heartfelt tune, that bears no resemblance to the similarly titled Christmas song.\n\nThe album gets rounded out with three songs all respectably solid in their performance and creation. The Fruit Bats have delivered an album that will help pave their way to a successful continuation of their career. While not basking in as much overall critical praise as their peers, they don't need to be relegated to the dark hiding places of their namesake."}
{"text":"\"Pomegranates are one of the oldest fruits on\nearth, and also one of the most unique. Appealing from the outside, they\nharbor an intricate inner fruit structure\u2014small, jewel-like seeds that\nglisten like so many quartz crystals inside a geode. Where it may grow\noutwardly like many other fruits, the pomegranate's peculiar inner\nstructure develops in secret, until the day the fruits of its growth are\nopened to the eyes of the world.\n\nPomegranates are a band from\nCincinnati that began as a fun project between two friends, Jacob\nMerritt and Isaac Karns, eventually growing into a four-piece with Joey\nCook and, most recently, Dan Lyon. Over a span of two years, the band\nreleased two albums, 2008's Everything Is Alive and 2009's TJ\nLipple-produced Everybody, Come Outside!, both of which drew the\nimmediate attention of independent radio stations like KEXP, WOXY, and\nKCRW, and critical praise from the likes of Spin magazine for the band's\nvery sudden and prodigious growth in sound.\n\nWhat is that sound?\nIf the world could lean in and hear the sound of a pomegranate slowly\nopening up to the world, this is probably something close to what it\nwould sound like. On songs like \"Beachcomber\" and \"Everybody, Come\nOutside!,\" guitars and keyboards shimmer and shine, but never in the\nlazy, hazy ways of so many bands today.\n\nJacob Merritt's\npropulsive drumming keeps a nimble pace; while Joey Cook's clear tenor\nand Isaac Karn's more forceful vocals bounce off of each other atop the\nmix. Time signatures leap in and out and jewelled tangents appear around\nevery corner, but the songs always retain an upbeat and compact\nsentiment that belongs in the same sentence with The Beach Boys, Spoon,\nand French Kicks, the latter two with whom the band has already toured.\n\nHaving notched off those tours, as well as further dates with Islands\nand Blitzen Trapper, the band recorded their third LP, One of Us, with\nTJ Lipple at The Monastery in Cincinnati. Having cited inspirations like\nSpiritualized and Talking Heads for their work so far, the band's new\n\"psychedelic dream rock\" album looks to push further down experimental\nroads, with descriptors like \"textured,\" \"unusual,\" and \"challenging\"\nentering the conversation.\n\nCoincidentally, or perhaps not, such\nadjectives also describe that peculiar fruit called the pomegranate,\nwhich even now is difficult to find and grows rarely. When allowed to\nflourish, though, a pomegranate becomes a delicacy, its inner textures\nat once alien and familiar, and it is ultimately prized for its flavor.\nWhere else can one find such a unique flavor?

{"text":"Have you ever gone camping and sat around a fire with a guitar in a non-hippie sort of way? And don't start with the creepy boy-scout-molestation ideas, either. But you know, just been out under the million stars you can't see in the city, singing songs for people you're close with, and trying to stay warm by a small fire? Well, neither have I, but after hearing the Static Films debut album on BlueSanct, I think I've got an idea what it might be like.\n\nThere's a certain intimacy involved with the above situation that you can't really fake, and on \"Force Over Distance,\" Static Films does that very well. At least, on some songs. This album is frustrating because there are moments of brilliance and then moments of over-indulgence that make you want to just shake whoever is responsible and say \"What the hell are you doing?! Just stop it! Christ!\" Well, maybe not that extreme. It?s like when your mom makes that amazing chocolate cake that she's made for you most of your life. You love this cake; it's the most delicious and moist cake you've ever tasted. Then, just because she can, she tries some other recipe that's not that great. It frustrates you because you think \"Mom! We all know what you?re capable of - we've tasted your cake! Why did you go and do this silly experiment?\" That's how I feel about certain songs on this album.\n\nThe CD opens with the lovely, albeit lengthy, title track. It's with this song that I'm most reminded of the aforementioned campfire scenario. There's something haunting and beautiful about this song, even though it's just a guy and his acoustic guitar. The vocals remind me of Simon Joyner, in a way. Lyrics like \"God is an open hand on her chest\" and \"Hope will await us there\" are sung with the most sincere honesty and longing. It is wonderful, and I feel like I shouldn't be hearing this, it's so intimate. There's one big problem with this song: it's 12 minutes long. Now, I have no problem with long songs, but honestly after 12 minutes of a guy doing solo acoustic guitar music, I want to punch him. This really is a wonderful song, but as the saying goes, you can have too much of a good thing. This is way too much.\n\nTrack two, \"Panthalassa,\" sort of suffers the same fate. The opening 2 minutes is this catchy kind of Smiths (in a very vague way) song. Then it goes into 5 minutes of droning and moaning that would be good for the a final minute and a half, but sheesh. It's especially annoying because it makes you wait even longer for the best song on the album, \"Cave Point Park.\" This song was what originally made me buy this CD. It's so delightful! It opens with some sort of instrument (I can't place it. I think it may be some sort of keyed instrument) and then an organ and\/or horns fade in with the vocals. It's really Victorian sounding, and I love it. There's also kettle drums (or toms mixed really deep) that accentuate the doubled vocals. Really, this song has this Tom Waits feeling to it that is fantastic. Harmonies, muted trumpet, sparse clanging cymbal work... this is the angle Static Films should focus on.\n\nThe rest of the album is really good, too. \"Optimism Rising\" is played slow on an electric guitar with minimal percussion and some nice harmonica playing. The vocals are sleepy in a good way, and the overall mood of the song is of someone who is at absolute bottom and realizes there're good things to come. I'm reminded of someone exorcising their demons through song just so they can move forward. \"Phosphorescent Aquatic Life\" is my second favorite song on the album and is mostly acoustic guitar and vocals, but there are some nice atmospheric sounds in the latter half and some subtle (but excellent) strings. Again, think intimacy times ten. I imagine watching someone through the window of their apartment getting awful news of some sort. There's something about this song that makes me picture someone pacing. \"Just Above Sea Level, Just Below Sea Level\" is a nice mix of \"Cave Pt. Park\" and the first part of \"Panthalassa.\" The bongos and other percussion make it even more catchy. He's beside the campfire again, but this time he brought friends to play along, too. The strings are a very welcome addition and contribute to the song's warmth. I want to hear this when I'm sipping a glass of red wine on my new balcony. \"Song for Emily\" starts off strong with the quiet guitar and sad vocals, but then it just becomes a doubled vocal track saying \"Na na na\" and other crap over and over again. This song is a good microcosm for the whole album. It's so close to being a remarkable record, but holds itself back.\n\nI learned three things from this album: 1. Static Films have a lot of promise and real songwriting talent. I look forward to his next album and have no idea what to expect (this is good). 2. I want to go camping and bring my guitar and my wife. I think it'd be wonderful and fun to record. 3. If I ever am at a show where someone plays a 12 minute song that's just guitar and vocals, I'm punching them in the fucking face. 7"}
{"text":"Early in his career, Norwegian singer-songwriter Sondre Lerch says he always tried to find ways not to sound like himself. However, now that he's released six studio LPs, including his latest self-titled effort, Lerche finally seems comfortable with who he is.\n\n\"I don't think it's a big departure, but it does feel like an extension,\" Lerch tells Spinner of his new album.\n\n\"I've come more to terms with the fact that I sound like myself. No matter what I do, I sound like myself.\"\n\n\"It's a bit more candid and lyrically more intimate,\" he continues. \"Serious sounds so boring, but lyrically it's the most concerned with what is actually going on, much more concerned with reality and not reverie in a way.\"\n\nOver the course of his musical career, which kicked off with recording his debut, 'Faces Down,' in 2000, Lerche has stuck to material that's autobiographical. Although, at times he's delved into topical subject matter, albeit subtly, writing about personal experiences and composing melodic sounds to match continues to be his forte.\n\n\"Everything I do is very melodic, harmonically pretty juicy, so that's always a redeeming factor even when the subject matter becomes a little uncomfortable or unpleasant,\" he says. \"One of the things I'm really thankful for is that you can write about stuff that is occasionally negative and not necessarily a pleasant experience, but when you turn it into a song and share it with an audience, it's usually always a positive experience or gets to be uplifting.\n\n\"I have songs that I touch upon things that go on outside of my own world, but I write a lot of songs so I always have more song than I need -- I don't know if it's a coincidence or it's maybe my instinct, but I've often ended up getting rid of those songs. There's a process of elimination there, and I guess there are a couple songs that didn't make this album that are a bit less on the introspective side.\"\n\nBecoming comfortable with how he sounds isn't the only difference between the Lerche of old and now, he's also become accustomed to keeping mum about the details regarding the subject matter of his songs and, in the process, encouraging the listener to develop their own meaning.\n\n\"The most important thing to me is that people find their own stories and their own truths,\" he says. \"That's the fun part and why I never really tell people much about the specifics of the songs, because I did that in the beginning and they'd be disappointed when they heard from my perspective what the song was about. You can ruin people's whole memory or experiences with a song, because it means something to them and it takes on completely different meaning.\n\n\"History shows us that the songs -- the myth, the experience and the emotion -- live longer the less you explain"}

{"text":"Over the years, the term \"concept album\" has gotten a bit of a bad rep. Sure, you've got your masterworks like Sgt. Pepper's and Ziggy Stardust, Pink Floyd and The Who kinda perfected the whole thing with albums like The Wall and Quadrophenia and Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral and Jay-Z's American Gangster were pretty good too. For the most part though, overzealous metal bands and certain pop punk groups have unfortunately devolved the idea with bloated conceptions, weak narratives and pretentious \"rock operas.\" Along comes an album that seeks to redeem the idea of the unified theme. Along comes an album that conveys diversity within its overall similarity. Along comes an album that transcends its perceived \"albumness.\" Along comes the NEXUS soundtrack by SOLA-MI.\n\nAccording to the SOLA-MI website, they are a self-described \"concept.\" On the surface, the simple story is that Derek did the writing, Josh did the producing and Latifah did the singing. However, even just one listen through NEXUS will show that such a seamless and complementary collaborative work is far more than just a connect point A to point B and then attach to point C kind of operation. How does a singer properly convey lyrics they didn't write? How does a living melody truly find its place within programmed beats, synthesized loops and vocal samples? How do you move from the first idea to a completed creative work? When you start asking questions like these, you're not too terribly far off from being able to delve into some of the questions presented within NEXUS. \"Where are you just before you wake from a dream?\" \"Where are you just before your first breath?\"\n\nThe concept running through NEXUS is clearly presented in the opening track \"Keynote.\" The idea of singularity and machine self-actualization is alluded to with vocal samples from the film \"Transcendent Man\" based on Ray Kurzweil's opinions and predictions on the future state of technology and machinery. As the voices end up mashing together over singular, bubbling tones, the track runs right into the opening strains of \"Mother Mother.\" The clever juxtaposition of a mechanized drum beat and what sounds like a heart monitor moving from death to life is a clever touch to convey the idea of a wakening machine. Latifah's disembodied vocals on \"Mother Mother\" change back and forth from an echoey, almost robotic delivery to bursts of emotive, melodic flourishes. The last 30 seconds or so of \"Mother Mother\" sounds like a computer transmission ticked out over an ominous sonic backdrop. It's thematic and moving to say the least. As the first movement of \"The Naming\" gurgles in, things start getting even more interesting. Broken into three sections (\"Degustation,\" \"Certificate\" and \"Selection\"), \"The Naming\" is a fascinating, mostly instrumental medley within the overall work. \"Degustation\" is quite active and agitated, \"Certificate\" is both breathy and punctuated and \"Selection\" is like an atmospheric announcement. As an added note of interest, \"Certificate\" features a cool sample of the song \"New\" by one of Derek's talented friends, singer\/songwriter Kate York.\n\nAs the album continues, \"Crowd of Silent Strangers\" implies the initial struggles faced once awake and features Latifah's amazing vocals conveying the lonely observations, \"this meaning is so meaningless\" and \"this feeling is so meaningless without you.\" I'm pretty sure those lines are meant to be multi-layered and not just specific to the story presented here. There's some great instrumentation and distorted beats on the outro of this one as well. \"The Blessing of Being Bloodless\" kicks in next with some really cool patterns and melodic lines. This is one of many downright danceable moments tucked away within NEXUS. There are also some more amazingly weighty lyrics in this one on the ideas of becoming and transforming. \"Trust Falling\" maintains an overall modern flare while having fun with some decidedly 80s keyboard tones. There are even some handclaps in this one! Who said concept albums can't be fun? The chorus on \"Trust Falling\" sounds really incredible and again, the lyrics \"I am letting go of everything, I am opening my mouth to sing\" poignantly seem to be a little more than meets the ear. Good luck getting this one out of your head anytime soon. NEXUS closes out with \"Silver Grizzly,\" a rhythmic, airy conclusion that features another huge chorus and more piercing lyrics. As the track fades out, the heart monitor beep from \"Mother Mother\" returns. However, this time it moves in the more recognizable pulses of life to death, ending the album with the distinctive monotone drone of lifelessness.\n\nNEXUS achieves what a concept album, and more importantly what a genuine work of art, should. It has a gorgeous story arc, multiple entry points, significant statements, purposeful questions and creative moments that ebb and flow within themselves and within each other. If that all comes across as a little too much or more than you are usually looking for, just know it sounds really cool and has an incredible overall tone to it. No matter the level of depth or surface you choose to interact with NEXUS with, there's something there for you. However, as good as the album sounds and as impressive as the songs are, the most mind-blowing part of NEXUS is that it is free. That's right, free. As in, click a button, wait a moment, own an incredible album. You have zero excuses to miss out on this beautiful concept album (that contains an actual concept.)\n\nSOLA-MI's debut album, the original motion picture soundtrack for NEXUS, can be downloaded for free at  or here at NoiseTrade.\n\nWhen writer Will Hodge isn't freaking out in a moonage daydream,you can find him running off at the keyboard about music, concerts and vinyl at My So-Called Soundtrack"}

{"text":"The Fray: 'Heartbeat' - Single review\n\nThe Fray divide the world in two. There's those who lose themselves completely in the band's worthy middle America rock and frontman Isaac Slade's deep'n'meaningfuls. Then there's the rest of us, who find it incredibly easy to ignore the band's earnest, po-faced records. To non-believers, The Fray come off as an ungodly mix of Creed and early Keane. Their acolytes might describe hits 'How To Save A Life' and 'Over My Head (Cable Car)' as \"inspiring\", but they're mistaking vague universality and well-meant bluster for something deeper.\n\nNaming their third album Scars & Stories doesn't inspire much hope that the band have made a radical departure, but 'Heartbeat' is actually their best single to date. Maybe it's the shift from wimpy pianos to chugging guitars, or perhaps it's Slade's previously pained warble being recast as a more throaty, Counting Crows-esque Americana growl. It's so chirpy that, for a change, we don't even mind the clumsy love-as-fire metaphors and other lyrics seemingly focus-group constructed to launch a million tumblrs; \"I wanna kiss your scars tonight\" indeed."}

{"text":"Summary:\nKevin Barnes expands his musical experimentation with the latest release from this Athens, Georgia indie-pop band, adding R&B stylings to the mix with the appearance of guest vocalist Janelle Mon\u00e1e.\n\nFantastic. The sounds are huge and organic. The lyrics are deep, enigmatic, devastating, and hopeful. The vocals are distinctly Kevin Barnes, which is frankly a great thing. The guest stars are incredible (Janelle and Solange sing with Kevin masterfully, and Nina makes a brief appearance saying something in Norwegian). The sounds are definitely more rock than usual (Coquet Coquette and Famine Affair). Even if the lyrics completely escape you, you can get quite a bit of enjoyment from the music. It really helps your understanding if you've familiarized yourself with Of Montreal's insanity, but this album shouldn't be weird enough to scare away first-time listeners. This album is great fun to sing along with your friends (especially while playing badminton), but it will really begin to show its depth after some meditation. False Priest begins to tell a story. You will understand Kevin Barnes' disappointment, resentment, devastation, and joy. There are numerous references to science (genetics, nuclear physics, etc.), which isn't too unusual. Researching mythology and science will always provide a better understanding of Of Montreal. When I began to contemplate an appropriate score for this album, I considered what I would have improved. I really could think of nothing. It's fun, deep, tragic, and can smoothly shift from euphoric to destroyed. When I hear Kevin cry out the line from Around the Way- \"getting so ****ed up trying to cure you, it's so draining. How can I help when you won't talk to me?!\" I literally get goosebumps. His emotion is expressed so fully that it hurts. This album is everything he said it would be. Salute your Busta-Rhymeness!\u00e2\u2026Collapse\n\nThe best album of 2010. A blunt statement, for a blunt album, and blunt it is indeed. Not only is it trippy and bizarre, it's also very aware. Unlike it's predecessor, False Priest knows exactly what it is, and even though it's not quite as masterful as Skeletal Lamping, it's more than just a worthy follow up.\u2026Expand\n\nI love this album! I find it so uplifting! Its just something to listen to when you just feel like sitting back and being entertained. Such a bold album by a very bold band paid off in the end. 10 out of 10 and much praise from me!\u2026Expand"}
{"text":"Fresh off Earth House Show, Ishmael Talks New EP\n\nIshmael is busy these days. Invigorated with new material after recording an EP in the dead of night in New York's Tarbox Studios, the band reemerged at Earth House this past Saturday for a triumphant, proggy whirlwind of new tracks (like the infectious, rhythmically-baffling \"Feet Stomp\"), well-worn older jams, and...an impromptu Tool cover?\n\nAnyways, I caught up with the vastly gifted Wes-based four-piece, which includes familiar faces Jordan Lewis '13 and Andy Werle '12, as well as McGill's Nick Otte and NYU's Aaron Silberstein to talk about new material, legendary engineer Tim Palmer, and the pros and cons of Katy Perry's \"Part Of Me.\"\n\nThe Argus: Tell us about the new EP.\n\nIshmael: The songs are only a small portion of our original repertoire, so we were just trying to get all the colors of ourselves across as effectively as possible, and we think these songs were the right choices for that. I'd say we jumped at the chance to experiment a bit more with the toys at our disposal.\n\nA: What influenced you most while recording it?\n\nI: We were actually listening to the 24-track master tapes to \"Killer Queen.\" You can hear Freddie breathing.\n\nA: How did you manage to get set up with Tim Palmer in the first place?\n\nI: After we were finished with all of the actual recording and we were finished with nearly all of the \"production\" work, it was basically just a matter of doing our research about who we wanted to mix the record. We always knew that we wanted someone \"professional\" to do the final mixes and it just came down to finding someone that we trusted who would also agree to do the project. Luckily, Tim was very responsive to the music and really liked the rough mix that we sent him of \"Kansas 1943 (In The Future).\" He basically agreed to the project after hearing this first song.\n\nA: What was it like working with him?\n\nI: Getting the songs mixed was a weird experience because Tim lives in Austin, Texas. After we sent him the files on hard drives, we would suddenly get an email every couple of days with a mixed song that sounded a hundred times better than what we'd sent. The process basically consisted of sending him songs that were \"at the mix stage,\" and him starting with an initial pass at the song, and then two or three more mixes of each song that would be refined based on our comments. Throughout the entire process, Tim was really receptive to our input and was a pleasure to work with. Obviously, given his experience, we wanted to give him creative latitude. Sometimes, like with particular delays and reverbs, he made decisions that surprised us when we first heard them. We had gotten so used to hearing the songs sounding a particular way that when we first got them back we had to really allow ourselves to re-hear the songs like a first-time listener. It was a very interesting process to be involved in.\n\nA: Why record in the dead of night?\n\nI: The initial plan was to record it using our own gear in [bassist\/singer] Nick's basement. We went out to buy all this crazy shit and even borrowed a mixer that had been used to record Paula Abdul from Sugarbox Studios where Jordan was working. But by then Jordan had been working at the studio long enough that his bosses were cool with letting us record when it was free, which was basically from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. So we basically recorded in the dead of night because we had to, but in retrospect we're happy it happened that way. There was something indescribable about being so creative, and loud, while most of New York slept, and it freed up our inhibitions so we could try some weird stuff.\n\nA: What exactly went down with the Eclectic \"bureaucratic bullshit\" last semester?\n\nI: We were all set to play there, but at 8 p.m. on the day of the show we heard through the grapevine that nobody had registered the show with the school and PSafe would shut it down if it went on at Eclectic. Luckily enough there was a show going on at Psi U the same night, and the organizers were extremely cool in letting us get a great slot at the last minute.\n\nA: How did you get those ridiculous rhythmic parts down on [first single] \"Feet Stop\"?\n\nAndy Werle: Well, our drummer Aaron tells us it's based on an Afro-cuban Bata rhythm that we excerpted. From there it was a matter of literally taking the first thing I played over it. Sometimes we fiddle with a song forever, but \"Feet Stomp\" flowed.\n\nJordan Lewis: I can't really comment too much on \"Feet Stomp\" since my part isn't actually that complex, but I would say that in general the more complex rhythmic stuff is approached usually by us asking, \"What could we do here that would really shake things up in a cool way?\" Rhythmically, what we're doing is not really that crazy, it's just that we try to put things together in ways that sound unique to us and hopefully to our listeners.\n\nA: What was the strangest part of playing at Earth House this weekend?\n\nI: Trying a bunch of new stuff. We went against our usual setlist scheme, played new tunes fresh, and learned a cover hours before (\"Stinkfist\" by Tool). Jordan took over on bass for \"Stinkfist,\" and Nick grabbed the mic and went to mosh in the crowd. It was heavy.\n\nA: If you could play a concert anywhere on campus, where would it be?\n\nI: Probably in the four-way intersection of High and Church on the back of a parked pick-up truck.\n\nA: What are some other Wes musical acts you especially admire?\n\nAW: Gamelan with Sumarsam.\n\nJL: The music grad students are doing some really cool stuff here. Nice and quiet.\n\nA: Which Wesleyan professor would you invite to an Ishmael concert?\n\nJL: [Assistant Professor of German Studies] Ulrich Plass.\n\nAndy: [University Professor of Music] Sumarsam.\n\nA: What's the best record of 2012 so far?\n\nAW: Technically not 2012, but I'm still listening to the \"The Hunter\" by Mastodon, which came out in September."}
{"text":"Interview: The Viliets\n\n\u200bMusic today is obsessed with producing the craziest electronic bleeps and blurps you can come up with, but what happened to the tunes of yore? Not that we don't absolutely love and appreciate that kind of music, but you know, when people could just lay back, roll up a j, and listen to an entire Pink Floyd, The Beatles, or Yes record... the type of music that's not just a fleeting moment drunk by some hyped and farsed fad. It was a time when artists produced albums and not singles, when sampling was frowned upon because it wasn't considered original and therefore not creative enough for commercial release, when what you could do with a guitar completely overshadowed what you could do with a computer. Where the fuck did all those bands go?\n\nEnter The Vliets. This four-piece band from Dallas, Texas was first introduced to LFTF by our main man Skrause. They make music we wish people could still make by pulling from elements of classic rock, psych rock, and psych folk to the point that their music doesn't belong in this era and is timeless.\n\nTell me about you guys.\n\nOur band name The Vliets (pronounced 'vleets') is in reference to Don Van Vliet aka Captain Beefheart, one of my all time favorite musicians and artists. I started this band about 2 years and we've had many different members. Right now the band consists of myself, Daniel Gonzalez, Luke Ferrell and John Solis. I play guitar, bass, synthesizer, piano, drums. Daniel is on bass, drums, synthesizer. Luke is synthesizer, piano. John is drums. Our dynamic is unique, as in we don't get together as a band and jam and write and figure things out. If I write a song, I will write it in it's entirety and record each part as well, and the same goes for Luke and Daniel. After the songs are recorded, we then know how all of our parts are intended to be played, we learn them, and play them live. I have 5 or 6 new songs I'm in the process of recording right now that the rest of the band hasn't even heard, and I know Luke has been working on a few that no one has heard yet either. I used to desperately want a band that could get together on a daily basis, be best friends, all be on the same page, and just make good music. But I found after trying to write with many people and be like that, that being a band is a very delicate thing with lots of ego's involved, and I hated it so this situation is perfect right now.\n\nI love your writing style of everyone kind of doing their own thing and then learning each tune from each other. Do you think this hinders your process though? Has it ever been the case that you just really do not like a tune that someone else wrote or someone doesn't like your tune? What do you say in a situation like that?\n\nIt doesn't hinder my process, I usually write most of the parts on the spot during recording and I have to be completely alone when doing so. It's difficult for me to write with others, and I've found that when I have collaborated it never turns out right and there's always something about the song that will bother me. Anytime a song comes to me, it's when I'm on the piano and my mind is blank with zero influence on what I'm actually playing, then something comes. I have to be alone while I'm doing this, anyone there is a distraction. Any song that I've written that I really like has been done that way and it's what's most comfortable to me.\n\nThere have definitely been times when one of us hasn't liked someone else's song, and it's a pretty awkward situation when that happens. It hasn't happened lately, but it did a lot in the past. Everyone who's been in the band is pretty passive aggressive though, sometimes when situations like that would arise, I'd start hearing about things others members had said about me to other people who weren't even in the band..So it's definitely a delicate matter. Sometimes feelings are hurt and people get pretty pissed off and will talk shit about you behind your back. But it's the same as if we were all writing a song together and someone didn't like a specific part someone is playing, rather we're all writing an album together and the songs are the parts, if that makes sense.\n\nTell me about your writing process.\n\nTo me, the process of writing music is a spiritual experience and\/or communication with inter-dimensional spirits. I've never sat down and been like 'oh I want to write a song that sounds like this..' it doesn't work that way, and comes through in the music and feels contrived. Anytime I've written something that I actually like, it's come from somewhere else. It's a meditation of sort, your mind goes blank and you're playing your instrument, and then something is coming out of you that took no prior thought, it's just a thought, idea, image, or feeling that is being transmitted through you from another dimension, and you're just the instrument to pull it out of one dimension, and into this one. Then it's my job to take these messages or thoughts or whatever you want to call it, and arrange them and make sense out of them. I usually achieve that state by playing piano or synth, then once I figure out the basic chord structure of the song, I record the keys, and gradually add the guitars, bass, drums, vocals, etc.\n\nI agree with you that writing music is a very spiritual process. To emulate is to not be true to yourself. At some point though all ideas have been recycled and an attempt to make it your own becomes less apparent to the listener. So I guess my question is how do you know when you've been inspired? How do you know it's coming from your spiritual base and not from merely a combination of other sources? Could a combination act as a vehicle through which spiritual insight emerges? Does all that make sense?\n\nThat's a good question. You're right that ideas are definitely recycled, which can be good or bad. The act of listening to music and being greatly affected by it is the same sort of spiritual connection as if it presented itself to you and directly made it your song. For example, the other day I was listening to Radiohead and there was a way that Thom sang a line that invoked so much emotion that I immediately had to go write music and it wasn't because I wanted to write something that sounded similar to what I had heard, it was the feeling I got from it that made me excited to create. The way I think about it is that you're not inventing music, time or sound when you write a song, you're simply manipulating things that are already possible. I didn't invent the specific chords or notes I use in a song, I try to connect to the spiritual realm to find the feelings to translate through a recording with my instruments.\n\nThere will definitely always be an influence from artists I listen to and love, but I think that's more of a style thing than the actual writing, and hopefully it's not such an influence on my style that I'm just a knock off of others. I'm certain that all of my writings have come from a purely spiritual place, even if the inspiration was stemmed from another song, I believe that's just as communicative with the spiritual realm if the inspiration is the feeling, not the actual notes and melody being used. So to answer your question directly, yes a combination would definitely act as a vehicle for spiritual insight.\n\nHow do you know when you've finished a song?\n\nThere's a point when the song just feels right, and if it doesn't, it's not done. Sometimes I end up with a lot of instrumentals, because I believe that was the best way to get the emotion across, and adding lyrics and a melody would've been contrived therefore ruining the true nature of the song.\n\nYou seem to have a very calculated approach to writing music. You know what works for your style and what doesn't. With that said, what do you think is missing from modern music and why is it missing? Do you feel like some artists are really forcing artistic expression?\n\nAs far as what's missing, I'm not sure if it's the case for every city, but in Dallas it's more about acting like a band and doing things on stage that bands are expected to do or what you've seen bands do before, and that's not conducive to an artistic environment. It's kind of like I have friends that I'm super comfortable around and I know I could say anything to, like if I cried listening to a beautiful song or something and they wouldn't make me feel weird about having an emotion like that. I have other friends who would think I was a pussy for saying that because that's not typically socially acceptable. I want to feel like I can do anything on stage and experiment and fucking jam sometimes, and unfortunately Dallas isn't wired for that. Maybe other cities are different. So other than the live aspect, I don't really think that there's anything missing from music today, I'm excited about a lot of the new sounds coming out. Especially in electronic music.\n\nYes, definitely. Having a band and wanting it to make money or be popular basically means starting a small business. I think more times than not, bands will have a target audience and that really comes through in the music, it sounds bland and contrived. I don't like to talk negatively about bands, but The Black Keys are one who fit that description and they are everything that's wrong with modern music, in my opinion. It's just a style, with zero artistic substance and is totally forced. Besides, why not just go all the way and listen to The White Stripes, right? I think John Frusciante is the best example of everything that's right with modern music. The guy really does it for pure artistic expression. He's quit the Red Hot Chili Peppers twice after making them famous because he felt he was compromising his artistic integrity. Apparently right now he has the better part of 300-400 songs that he may not even release because he doesn't want it to become a product and I really admire that. Don't get me wrong though, I'm not saying it's wrong to be famous or make money off of your music, but you can easily separate the artists from the suits.\n\nWhere do you want your music to take you?\n\nI'm not sure. I don't know what I would do if a label wanted sign us and release albums and go on tour and all. I would only do something like that if it made it to where all I had to do was focus on writing music all day. That would be the best case scenario. Otherwise I'm completely happy recording songs on my own and releasing them on the internet.\n\nWhat do you think about social media?\n\nI think social media is great. It's how I've gotten my music out there. Among Twitter, Facebook and SoundCloud I've been able to reach hundreds of people with my music and have made friends with other artists in the process. We're based out of Dallas, and play in Dallas but no one really knows about us here. We have more people listening to our music in other countries than we do in our own city, and that's all due to blogs like LFTF and social media. Otherwise, I doubt anyone would ever hear our music.\n\nWhat's in store for The Vliets in the future?\n\nWho knows. In the immediate future, I have probably 20 new songs that are pretty much done and need to be recorded. So we'll play some shows here and there and hopefully release a ton of songs over the course of the year."}

{"text":"Deerpeople\n\nEverything, pinballing at warp speed\n\nSeveral times a set, the lead singer of Deerpeople will descend into the audience, contort his body so that his shoulder is aimed at the audience like a battering ram, then throw himself at people. It looks bizarre, because it is far more calculated that most moshing: it looks a lot like a drunken stagger, but it's done for a very particular result.\n\nIt's a perfect analogy for Deerpeople's music. Their music encompasses piano-pop, dance-rock, indie-rock and acoustic instruments (violin, accordion) into an ever-evolving mishmash that attacks the audience. The stops and starts of Deerpeople's songs are jarring, but intentionally so: the vocals are often harsh, but for effect. Deerpeople is in the business of making wholes out of things that are usually not whole. This conceptual framework is what the best bands do today: they don't just mash up genres, they make consistent things out of lots of pieces of other things. Deerpeople doesn't have a genre, and that's to the better for the listener. It's way more fun to listen to them, because there's a turn around every corner.\n\nIt also helped that the Buffalo Lounge was a hometown crowd, and Deerpeople are on the brink of major success. (The band has somewhere between 7 and 12 shows to play this SXSW, and that's an easy indicator that a lot of people are listening to what Deerpeople's doing.) This was a victory lap before the hard work of SXSW comes, and they enjoyed it for all it was worth. The band interacted with the fans, the fans sung along, the band smiled. It was a festive atmosphere, which only enhanced the jubilation of the tunes.\n\nDeerpeople are onto something big with their ideas: you should check them out before they don't play around here that often anymore. They're from Stillwater, so I'm putting them in the Other Lives\/Colourmusic category at the moment: Band Most Likely to Not Have to Play SXSW Next Year Due To Being Famous."}

We're writing 10 songs,\" say the five guys. \"We're probably not going to record until December. We got plenty of time but we're gonna be writing for a long time. We're gonna be writing August, September, October, November, just writing this record. Making it the best we can make it, and we're really excited.\"\n\nFor five local high school students, having a record label pay for mass production of a CD and merchandise too isn't a bad gig.\n\n\"What the record label told us is they found our music to be really driving, which is like the biggest compliment we could get,\" they said. \"We want to write passionate sound and that's what we're trying to go with. The fact that they liked it and they think it's worth putting on a big scale is awesome.\"\n\nThey still say though that putting out a CD and having people hear about them isn't the best part and it's not why they do what they do.\n\n\"We wanna play constantly. I'd like to play a show every night as long as I can. Nights like this are the best. The feeling people are really being effected by your music, cause that's why we like music, because it's music we can relate to.\""}
{"text":"Tennis serves up pop style that bloggers love\n\nFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Tennis is a band that never was meant to be a band, playing music that was never intended for other to hear.\n\nThe fact that the duo \u2014 husband and wife Patrick Riley and Alaina Moore \u2014 is even touring and performing is a testament to the power of music blogs.\n\nLike a new-age FM dial, today's music blogs introduce new artists to a music-listening public that passes around MP3 files like people once shared cassette mixtapes. Bands of the moment \u2014 like Tennis was this summer \u2014 are introduced weekly. Some hold on, some don't.\n\nTheir success is an example of one or two small bloggers sharing a song, and the big taste-making blogs (Pitchfork, Stereogum and the like) jumping on it and co-signing them as a band everybody should like.\n\nThe band's actual story is much more lo-fi than that, though. They were just two people making music that reminded them of a special time together. In their case, it was vintage-sounding pop songs that made them feel like they were at sea again.\n\nFirst up was the song \"South Carolina,\" which got them some attention, then came \"Marathon,\" the song they're best known for. Now, the band's full-length debut album, \"Cape Dory\" is due Jan. 18.\n\nWe talked to Moore to learn more about the band's background, the effects of the Internet and, of course, tennis.\n\nQ: I've read a bunch of stuff about the band's genesis, most of it involving a sailing trip and you two only playing music less than a year. I'd like to hear you tell the story.\n\nA: Patrick and I decided to do an experiment and try living on a boat and sailing for as long as we could afford it, living as simply as possible. We did that for eight months, then we needed to find work again. We moved back to Denver.\n\nIt was really hard leaving the boat and leaving the ocean behind. It made us very nostalgic for being on the boat, so we started writing all these songs as reminders. It was just for fun, something we did at home. We both had 40 hour-a-week jobs. We really liked them, so we started writing more songs.\n\nAll of the sudden, we were a band, I guess, playing shows and sharing our music with people. It kind of happened spontaneously.\n\nQ: When the blogs promoted the music, was it one of those things where it just took off one day and completely blindsided you guys?\n\nA: We in no way tried to share our music with anybody. I actually didn't even understand music blogs or how they worked.\n\nI had a really good friend who contributes to a really small music blog. He asked if he could post one of our songs (\"South Carolina\"). It wasn't even mastered. Then some other blogs started pulling it from his website. Then all of the sudden this unmastered song was all over the Internet. We gave (\"Marathon\") to one friend who posted it in one place, then four days later it was on Pitchfork.\n\nQ: \"Marathon\" took off over the summer with its sort of surfy, vintage pop vibe. Is that what people should expect from the album?\n\nA: The album definitely has that kind of feel. That's the style of music that we associate with being on the sea and being on a boat.\n\nQ: It seems like there are a lot of couples music duos these days. I could see that being great, and I could see it getting messy. What's the best thing about it and what's the worst?\n\nA: It's awesome because we didn't decide to get married until after we lived on the boat first, so it absolutely forced good communication. We know we work really well together. We've been through harder things than being in a band and playing shows. Actually, being in a band is really easy.\n\nThere is one bad thing \u2014 (being a couple) is one little fact that allows people to make little assumptions about you. I think it's really easy to see it as a cliche. It's one more way for us to be lumped into a group that we don't necessarily fit with.\n\nQ: Silly question: If you guys played a tennis match, who would win?\n\nA: Patrick would destroy me in a tennis match. He used to play tennis a lot growing up.\n\nWriting about the best indie-pop seems inherently an individualized, personal experience -- but that is fitting for a type of music that on one level seems more person-oriented than mass-movement-oriented.\n\nIt's not like Young and Old is exactly an example of a difficult second album or a sophomore slump, but the album does find Tennis going through the growing pains that come with the maturation process."}

{"text":"Posts tagged Fragrant WorldDuring a recent conversation I had playfully discussed the kind of music that you would want to hear as you \"die on the dancefloor\", we were mentioning a few bands, but none came as close to the harrowing, oft-brazen sounds of the latest from the Brooklyn trio, Yeasayer. With their patented off-kilter percussion and saturated bass, they have created an album for the end-times, without much preamble. Their previous records\u2014 the freak-folk All Hour Cymbals, and the playful Odd Blood\u2014 poised them as an experimental, even progressive synth pop outfit, engaging in more lofty ideals than their counterparts, artists like HEALTH or Miike Snow. On Fragrant World, they have neglected some of their better attributes for a more aggressive, eerie journey. While it remains rambunctious as ever, they've replaced the charming disorder that they became known for with dreariness, resulting in a much harsher listening experience. It fares relatively well for them, but doesn't make for their best work.\n\nUpon my initial listen, it was difficult to point out any \"single ready\" tracks, unlike the immediate \"2080\" or \"Ambling Alp\". However, after revisiting it over the past few weeks, it has redeemed itself continuously, reverting back to a more primal ambiance. The crunching, EDM tribal beats are perfected in most of the selections, most notably on \"Fingers Never Bleed\" and \"Damaged Goods\", but it's when they slow it down in the burner,\"Henrietta\" that they make the best work. Despite the album's desolate nature, there are some truly inspiring moments, most effectively in the song \"The Devil and the Deed\", with is juxtaposed title; it is the closest thing to a dance anthem on the entire record. Again, with constant listens, \"Blue Paper\" could also be deemed as a possible single, its handclaps making it a slightly more fun affair, not to mention the homage to Lionel Richie in its end.\n\nPessimism is dripping off this album, lyrically and thematically, slaving over everything from bank closures to environmental weariness. Yeasayer are anxious for the not-too-distance future, nervous for their livelihoods and those of their friends, and while they express it in a denseness unlike anything they've produced to date, it is the reflection of their past that keeps them grounded. When immortality seems more of a reality over time, by the album's end, they are closer to embracing it. The final track, \"Glass of a Microscope\", reminds me of Radiohead's Kid A; it's a creature born out of sterile and austere conditions, desperately trying to break the surface. It's not the grandest of ideals, but it's definitely hopeful.\n\nAs the Summer progressed it became evident as more albums were announced that August, September, and October would be three of the most impressive months for new albums in recent years.\n\nFor me to list them all would take too much time, but close to the top of this list is Yeasayer's highly-anticipated third album Fragrant World, an album with a lot of ground to cover if it's to match the critical acclaim of its predecessor Odd Blood.\n\nEarly reviews of the album seem to suggest that they're onto something with tracks such as \"Longevity\" and \"Henrietta\" generating a good amount of buzz, and showing that they haven't lost their experimental electronic quirk. I'm making my way through my first listen of it now and where Odd Blood had some huge tracks that could propel the band onto mainstream radio, Fragrant World seems to have replaced the \"hits\" with more in-depth songs that you can lose yourself in for weeks.\n\nFragrant World is released on August 21st via Secretly Canadian, and thanks to NPR you can listen to it in full below, nine days before it's released.\n\nThis morning Yeasayer made a boo boo. They dropped the video for their new track \"Longevity\" even though it wasn't supposed to come out until this afternoon\/evening.\n\nIf you were one of the ones lucky enough to have caught it before it was removed, you'll know that it's got Yeasayer's off-the-wall brand of electronic indie-pop written all over it, though it's not as frantic and fizzing as some of their older tracks.\n\n\"Longevity\", along with \"Henrietta\", is taken from their new album Fragrant World, out on August 21st via Secretly Canadian."}
{"text":"Athlete: Black Swan\n\nSouth Londoners Athlete followed their likable quirky debut Vehicles & Animals with two albums of solemn pop that sold almost a million copies combined - so it's no surprise that that's the route they continue to tread here. Having left EMI for Polydor imprint Fiction, Joel Pott and co hope to follow fellow Fiction emigres Elbow in going supersonic on a self-made record. Whether they will depends on the public's appetite for earnest melodies and lyrics that talk a lot without actually saying anything. Chris Martin's made a career out of it, so who knows, but Black Swan's generous servings of crescendo-and-strings guitar music are so all-encompassing that any charm is suffocated. They seem like a nice lot - but that's the problem, there's no edge. This is music for a Hollyoaks montage, or for waving mobile phones in the air to at V festival. It's hard to love."}

While the Devlins don't really have the most consistent release schedule (1993, 1997, 2002) the do manage to keep quite a fan base. Consent is an album full of emotion and quiet melodies. I have heard their music referred to as \"Night Rock\ufffd and that's exactly what emanates from Consent. It's the sort of music that you listen to at the end of a day. Almost like a downtempo rock. They have much in common with a lot of the British bands like Starsailor & Travis but for some reason they are more sought after on this side of the ocean. You will find that Consent basically needs your consent to enjoy. The more listens that you give, the more it will grow on you. It's quiet and subdued but the vocalist is bloody amazing and the band orchestration works amazingly well. The Devlins require multiple listens to gain full satisfaction."}
{"text":"Fred Avril - That Horse Must Be Starving\n\nAlbum Details\n\nThe Paris-based Fred Avril is a electro-pop musician that is making some very interesting and future looking pop music. I'm not sure how long he will be able to go by the name \"Avril\" because of the blossoming fame of Canadian Avril Lavigne but we'll see just how far he gets. As for his futuristic pop music, this should get him some well-deserved recognition. That Horse Must Be Starving has already won this year's Prix Constantin (the French version of the Mercury Prize). What's all the fuss about? Well, the music is left field, that's for sure. The album starts off with the spastic \"Double Mind\" that sounds like it should be on a Ninja Tune album. Then there are some tracks like \"Global Headphones\" that remind me of Grandaddy, the same sort of ethereal pop but hummable and immediately interesting. \"The Date\" is more along the lines of some of the electro-clash sounds we have heard recently from the likes of Ladytron. In his bio they state that Avril is something like a deranged synthesis of Serge Gainsbourg and Aphex Twin. This is indeed a correct analogy of Avril's music. It should be said that he sings in English and it sounds like it is quite easy for him. While That Horse Must Be Starving is not the sort of album that normally gets nominated for a prestigious prize, but it does offer music in a bit of an unconventional manner. It's fresh and that's what those people are looking for."}

{"text":"Review : Do Make Say Think - Other Truths\n\nWhen instrumental rock bands get tapped for soundtracks, it can be kind of a gut-check that tests how a wider audience may view their music. Sigur R\u00f3s' folkloric melodrama and emotive language made sense as a backdrop for Vanilla Sky, itself a sort of sci-fi fairytale about misplaced and unrequited love starring someone prone to over-excitement. The charged music of Explosions in the Sky fit the open expanses and crushing blows of Friday Night Lights' take on Texas high school football culture (hell, guitarist Munaf Rayani sometimes bends over his instrument like a lineman crouching down into a three-point stance). So it seemed odd that a track by Canadians Do Make Say Think was chosen for the oil industry drama Syriana. Not to say the Toronto post-rock band doesn't make the kind of mesmerizing music suitable for a film score (or that the more tense, overtly politicized music of Godspeed You! Black Emperor might have been a better fit). But DMST can sound so pastoral-- the music was literally recorded in a barn, in some cases-- it may seem to lack the bite for a blood-for-oil flick.\n\nWhile Do Make Say Think can project a gentle, laid-back vibe-- member Charles Spearin did just finish The Happiness Project-- they're far from spinning their wheels and rehashing post-rock clich\u00e9s. Other Truths doesn't roughen up the band's jazz-steeped aesthetic. But it does add more dimensions and sharp textures to their songwriting, which continues to get tighter yet wider in scope. Spread across a suite of four lengthy tracks and titled with the same string of verbs as the band's name, the album isn't about momentum as much as it is about transitions. Opener \"Do\" starts with crisp, intertwined guitar lines playing off one another. As the track morphs and unfurls-- cue the slow-build and crescendo-- the themes reappear more charged, parrying with horns and descending into static. \"Make\" quietly delays the payoff, slowly ratcheting things up and marching toward a climax with a floor of tense bass, echoing chants, and sinewy, stretched string notes. When a warm motif of horns and fuzzed guitars begins to cut through the dread, the song's color noticeably shifts. \"Say\" strikes a grandiose yet road-weary tone, as a lonely slide guitar melody gets echoed and expanded by trumpets and churning drums, while \"Think\" may be its companion and comedown, a slow trail set forth by a quivering, reverb-laden guitar line....full text\n\nStrangeglue\n\nThroughout their recording history Do Make Say Think have maintained a bewitching musical na\u00efvet\u00e9. At times you can hear them struggling to keep it alive, at others it gushes out unimpeded. Other Truths starts with the latter, bursting out of the door with 'Do' (yeah, you know what's coming, three tracks to follow\u2026), but touches on the former throughout. Apart from their unique guitar interplay, mystical brass and ecstatic percussion this is the contrast that keeps them going. They're pretty much one of the only instrumental rock bands I still listen to.\n\nOr is it naivet\u00e9 after all? We're in at the deep-end now, but I promise we'll be swimming to brighter waters soon enough, it's inevitable. Do Make Say Think seem very aware that music and everything could mean fuck all, but they have a firm-rooted conviction in mirth, beauty and ploughing on through whatever obscures that without losing their shit and taking it personally.\n\nThe twelve minute 'Make' starts out with one of the most addictive odd time signatures I have ever heard. A guitar, sounding for all the world like wood and electricity personified, sets up a brood. The drums make a seamless transition from tight and insistent kick\/snare\/high-hat cascades to heavier, more emotional rolling over the toms. These details are exquisite, and exciting to discover. A brief passage of distant chanting emphasises the slight tribal undercurrent (perhaps courtesy of the Akron Family and Lullabye Arkestra, who are credited with a vocal presence on the album).\n\nThe guitars then ascend with some subtle chorus effect adding new colour, eight minutes later and a surge of horns is bringing out the Pioneer in all of us. Post-Rock has been so verbally dogged by the word cinematic that even citing the overuse is a longstanding clich\u00e9, but listening to this record has inclined me to suggest that these guys have the skill of true cinematographers. They know how to shift one scene to another without predicting themselves in the transition. They have an intuitive understanding of colour and media: blending ragged and worn tape with blissful processed washes, while pristine clarity hovers in the distance.\n\nI could go on, but that would mean going on, so I'll wrap it up by quoting Nick Cave, speaking yesterday on Radio 4's The Today Programme:\n\n\"the worst thing that can happen in a film is when you feel over manipulated by the music\u2026 all music is manipulative, it's whether it's overly-manipulative or not\"\n\nI find bands like Explosions in the Sky overly manipulative, whereas I feel that Do Make Say Think achieve a real subtlety, which makes their bombast all the more rewarding. The moods are frequently hard to classify and although much of Other Truths is buoyant and sprightly, recalling most recent full length History in Rust, it surpasses that grand but not great album by incorporating more of the rough, jazz inflected transitions that made Winter Hymn, Country Hymn, Secret Hymn my favourite DMST record. The last two minutes of 'Make' blend Yanqui U.X.O era Godspeed with my memories of playing Christmas carols with a brass band in the town square when I was ten years old. Add a touch of Sufjan-esque honest-to-goodness warmth and you have somewhere very intriguing, colourful and life affirming for the imagination to inhabit. Manipulative, but not\u2026\n\n'Think' leaves me adrift in foreign lands, vibrato bends country chords down through the soil and up through the sky, and Other Truths has reminded me that every time I listen to a Do Make Say Think record I come out feeling rather fortunate to be making my way through things....full text\n\nTheskinny\n\nAs one of the leading reasons for Constellation's impeccable reputation, Toronto's Do Make Say Think somehow make being brilliant look and sound infuriatingly easy. The eight current members mix multiple drum kits, guitar, bass, violin, percussion, brass and woodwind into a vibrant nebula of jazz meets post-rock meets folk. Improving on the wobbly sound quality of some earlier releases, Other Truths is thankfully a relatively hi-fi recording, beautifully communicating the subtleties of this inspirational octet's lavish music. Opening track Do is the most urgent of those on show (the others unsurprisingly titled, Make, Say and Think) with an uncharacteristically prominent use of guitar, yet it never lapses into the delay-heavy arpeggiation of lesser contemporaries like Explosions In The Sky. Perhaps thanks to their folk background, DMST also hold onto a natural, airiness; avoiding fussy arrangement or heavy compression, allowing room to breathe and providing this album with a freshness on repeated listens....full text"}

He would have these crates and crates of records that were all '80s club hits, as well as more obscure stuff -- everything from Taylor Dane to Human League and Tears for Fears and Depeche Mode and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.\n\nGrowing up in D.C., I was into the post-punk stuff like Fugazi and Minor Threat, and there was a big kind of music in D.C. called go-go, which never really made it out of D.C. I started playing guitar and I was playing punk, but I was also playing more hip-hop, go-go kind of stuff, too. I think a lot of that stuff plays in well with the Small Black, which kind of has a hip-hop influence, but also a punk influence and also, like, and '80s kind of shoegaze-electro-dance-pop-ness.\n\nAfter you moved to New York to attend school, when did you start playing around the city and eventually join Small Black?\n\nI played in a bunch of bands with Jeff [Curtin], who is the drummer in Small Black, in college. When we graduated, me and him were working on a bunch of stuff, and then Ryan [Hener] and Josh [Kolenik, vocalist] were working on a bunch of stuff , and we got together on a band called Slowlands. It was folky with dance beats, but it was a rock band with actual guitar and bass and drums.\n\nThen Slowlands broke up, and we all started trying new kind of sounds. We were getting sick of guitars, and then, I'd say a year or two after Slowlands broke up, we got back together and starting sharing demos again.\n\nWhy did you get fatigued with a guitar-based sound?\n\nPersonally, I've been playing since forever, so I was glad to stop. I'm also kind of a producer; I do other productions than Small Black. I always wanted to play bass, because I think as a producer, it's one of the most important things to understand bass and how it moves around in a song. I was really excited to not play guitar, finally, after 10 to 15 years of playing guitar. We were all just sick of it. Ryan played in a hardcore band in Long Island for years and years, called Silent Majority, and it was one of the big punk bands there.\n\nWhy do you think Small Black resonated so much with people from the beginning?\n\nIt just was the right sounds at the right time -- a lo-fi, DIY bedroom project sounded good to people. Then there was the twist of it being kind of electro. People would say it had a homespun New Order kind of thing going, and that seemed to really resonate with people. They wanted dance-y, electro stuff, but they didn't want it to be all polished.\n\nWhen we started playing live, it seemed like we had this energy that people like. We've gotten cleaner in our sound, and some of the new stuff we're working on is a bit more mature-sounding. But there's something romantic about emotional dance music that not a lot of people do, I guess. When you think of dance music, you think of four-to-the-floor disco or '80s cokey stuff. We kind of tried to do dance music with a personal twist.\n\nYou mentioned that it was the right sound and the right time, and since you guys have come out, you've been lumped in with bands like Washed Out. But you don't sound like Washed Out. How do you feel about being lumped into this \"chillwave\" tag?\"\n\nWe got lumped in there because at that time, anything that was a lo-fi dance beat seemed to be \"chillwave.\" If it was at a reasonably slow tempo, between 80 and 110 BPM, and it was a little lo-fi and kind of swirly-sounding, it would just be chillwave. We're actually really good friends with Washed Out. We did a tour with them and played with them and remixed each other. We love them, but we all think it's funny how we get lumped together, because we don't see that much resemblance.\n\nHow has your newest material that you've written since your last album, 'New Chain,' evolved?\n\nFor one, we've been gravitating towards sort of more danceable, uptempo stuff. Also, we're really expanding the production on this new record. I felt like 'New Chain' was sort of trailing off our EP and was a little bit different but still had a lot of the same techniques. Now we're trying some new guitar, and I would say the new sound is faster, tighter, more minimal, more pop. Instead of having 40 keyboard tracks whirling into a swirling kind of haze, we toned it down a bit and brought the vocals up a bit. We still try to focus on the songwriting but let a more minimal production tell the story."}
{"text":"Nueva Vulcano \u2013 Split\n\nThe band composed most famously of Shiner's frontman has been kicking around for a few years now. The Life and Times have a worldly philosophy, releasing music everywhere and touring overseas since their inception. This split contains three tracks from both The Life and Times and Nueva Vulcano, a Spanish band (you probably guessed this already) from Barcelona. I'm actually partial towards the band I was unfamiliar with, even though I'll never be able to comprehend Spanish.\n\nA remixed song off The Life and Times' full-length is the first thing to come off this split. \"My Parade\" is actually \"Muscle Cars,\" but the name change signifies a Freeman Moxy remix. No, I cannot tell you what the hell that means. I compared it with the original a few times and the remix is pretty much a waste of your life. The most noticeable changes are some added twinkles and volume distortion. In essence, whoever was behind the wheel on this operation screwed the song over. Someone please tell me why there needs to be a \"remix\" of a Life and Times song in the first place?\n\nAnyways, the next song is more like what I wanted to hear. It's a subdued instrumental running about three minutes in length. I have a strong feeling that \"The Silent Take\" could be perfectly placed in a movie soundtrack as introspective fodder. The atmosphere is spread out and the mood settling. Typical of The Life and Times material, it's also very bittersweet in retrospective.\n\nNueva Vulcano brings some much needed focus back into my attention span. Out of the gates, they sound like early Appleseed Cast, but more disjointed. The riffs are bright and vocal melodies uplifting, but in terms of recording quality it's lacking. \"Palo Rosa\" has one of those bombastic build-ups or what I like to call \"cool parts\" when I'm not writing a review. If Nueva Vulcano writes more songs like the previous one, that are complete rather than unfinished thoughts, I'm all for it.\n\nThis split is out now on a Spanish record label, and if you're looking for it you can purchase it online. I know for a fact that The Life and Times' official store has all versions in stock. In any case, it's worth checking out, at least for a couple songs."}
{"text":"Archive for February 6th, 2011\n\nThere are thousands of free albums on Bandcamp, so how does a person decide to actually download and listen to one of the many? For me, it was easy. At least in this case. I saw the name Hasan Salaam and hit the link as fast as possible. Salaam's \"Children of God\" was one of the top 10 albums of 2008, and he's earned my ears in a major way. True, he's only one one of the cuts of One Eyed Kings' 5-song EP, but that alone is worth the price (free) and time it takes to cop a listen. How does it rate?\n\nOverall, Colorado's One Eyed Kings are a little clunky, but their spirit and lyrics have to be appreciated. Any rapper who can spit about the war in Iraq and the Tea Party Movement making him \"ashamed to be American\" warrants a shout-out. This kind of hip hop is never easy to write\u2013it's intensely political and conscious, lacking street-machismo or humor, so it's playing against the strengths of the genre\u2013but they do it pretty damn well. At least enough so I'm curious to hear what else these guys can do."}
{"text":"It's been about 12 years since 'The Books' began, and less than a year since we ended. Now that it's over it's time for me to jot down as much as I can about the project, the places it lived, and it's odd life, before I forget it. As sad as I am that it's over, it was an amazing thing to be a part of, and I'm grateful to everyone for their support and unbelievable kindness through the years. For those of you who are interested in the back-story, here it is\u2026 feel free to ask questions, I'll try to answer them.\n\nIn order to revisit the beginning of 'The Books' I've got to summon some pretty worn memories. Like anyone, there have been so many phases and places I've been through since then, that my cursory memories of that time have become somewhat cartoonish. I think a great quality of music, like with smell, is it's ability to conjure up deep-seated memories from the more unworn parts of the mind; places where the acidity of everyday thought has not melted and reformed them into oversimplified pictures. So I think the best place for me to start is by listening to the first track 'The Books' made (well before we had a name):\n\nIt's been almost two years since I remastered this track and I haven't listened to it again until now. And, once again, my memory of the sound of this track is flat compared to the re-experience. Something about the un-glossy crackle of the surface of sound that snaps me back into the feeling of those days in the spring of 2000, in 'upstate Manhattan'. We lived at 30 Seaman Avenue, Apt. 4H, just north of 200th St (Dykman Ave) on the A. I was living with my girlfriend, Julie Wolfe, and I had only lived in the city for a short time, having recently moved down from North Adams, MA where I lived during college. Julie and I met at the Williamstown Art Conservation Center; she was (and still is) an 'objects' conservator, and I worked in the 'analytical' department, mostly doing microscope work and identifying pigments and binders in paintings, for the purpose of helping to restore them, or rooting out fakes.\n\nI studied chemistry in school, with the original intention of having a career as a biochemist. When I realized that biochemistry, in practice, consisted of mixing one extremely dilute clear solution with another, I quickly hopped over to organic chemistry, which was more my speed with its colors and smells and occasional ether fires. I was drawn to organic chemistry also for the pictures: 3d diagrams of molecules smashing together extremely quickly in microscopic space in vast numbers. Which leads to my first (of many) digressions\u2026 (bear with me).\n\nIn 1996 I got a summer job in a lab that studied liquid crystals, a branch of materials science that studied compounds that are both ordered and fluid at the same time. A contradiction really\u2026 a rule breaking state of matter that had properties of both solid and liquid, the most famous application being the LCD (liquid crystal display) you're likely looking at now. Mostly my job was synthesis\u2026 taking two molecules and intentionally making a third, then purifying the desired compound away from all the junk I created by accident (a necessary inefficiency in chemistry, as in life, is the unintended consequences). When we had a candidate for a material that would show liquid crystalline properties we would throw it under a polarized light microscope and heat it up until it melted. When most crystals melt they go totally dark under the microscope (like water), but liquid crystals do this:\n\nThat's right! Fuckin' amazingly beautiful! And the pattern moves and flows as the temperature changes. Which leads me to digression 2:\n\nArt. What a stupid word. Sounds like a painful turd. When I was a kid I would try to paint like Bob Ross. It took me until my first year in college to realize that Art gets a lot more complicated when neurotic self-consciousness gets involved. Pretty becomes ugly and vice versa. Your mind becomes a battle ground for conflicting belief systems, and you tighten a tourniquet around the part of your spine that connects your brain to your body. Every thought becomes a high stakes experiment. Language becomes pure manipulation. Everything becomes relative. For or against. In parallel with my study of chemistry I took a lot of art classes at school. I always thought visually, and being in the studio alone at night was relaxing, so kept taking classes despite the impending existential nightmare. I remember going out to dinner with a teacher of mine, named Sheila Pepe. I attempted to take solace in chemistry. \"There's Truth in chemistry\", I would argue, \"Chemistry is real, stuff is real. It's made of chemicals.\" She would look at me, roll her eyes in a loving way, and say \"Nick, chemistry is just another way of looking at things.\" A chink in the armor. This feeling tore me up; that my view of science and it's values were na\u00efve, and my innocence was becoming a hindrance to my education. I think the biochemical term for this is 'denatured'. I was becoming denatured. Then digression number 3:\n\nI got cancer. In the winter of 1997 I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease\u2026 a relatively rare form of lymph cancer that was slow growing, but required immediate treatment. I was 22 at the time. I dropped out of school for the spring and moved back home to the Boston area to start radiation therapy to my neck and chest. This news made me numb and stupidly idealistic at first\u2026 I felt fine, and was actually in good shape at the time, so it all felt a little abstract, except it derailed me, narrative wise. I expected a straight shot through school into a lab job, but all of a sudden there was this time to sit and notice stuff. Given my shift in perspective on mortality, noticing stuff became somewhat of a consuming job. Then there was the radiation. Imagine the worst sunburn of your life on both the outside and inside of your body. That's what it was like. Beyond that I lost my sense of taste. Eating candy, which I always enjoyed, became like chewing asprin. I couldn't swallow anyway, so my attention shifted to walking, listening to music, and making stuff\u2026 mostly painting with an airbrush I bought leading up to the treatment. I was making terrible abstractions of the natural world, mostly, and listening to 'The Police' box set and Primus.\n\nIt was the first time in my life (that I could remember) that I was not in school in March, April and May. In this liminal place, sitting on the side of the tracks as it were, noticing stuff was getting easier. Like listening to a bell ring to silence, it was not as if the bell was getting quieter, it was as if the background was getting louder and overwhelming the tone of the bell. Everything became brighter and more mysterious; ordinary things became strange and scary. The namable parts of things were overtaken by the phenomenon of them, everything having a history that was ultimately untraceable. As the fatigue from the radiation kicked in, those days sprawled into each other in a dreamlike way. My relationship to my body was interrupted in a way that made me look at myself like a specimen. I was disembodied. Again, denatured. Like a fried egg.\n\nGoing back to school that fall, I had what most people with a life-threatening illness have: an overdeveloped sense of urgency: as if life was running out and everything had to be done to the utmost. Since medical technology had given me a 'second chance' it somehow meant that I had to do something 'important' and fast. I threw myself into a chemistry thesis, working long hours in the lab, trying to succeed at making a molecule that, it turns out, was quite difficult to make. I quickly became exhausted and frustrated and short on temper and friends. Things were already losing their brightness, dampened by my own designs for them. My chemistry professor pulled me aside one day and said that I was the type of scientist that would have been better off in the 1800's when the frontier was more open, and being 'mad' was still a useful trait for a scientist. I felt embarrassed by this, but I knew she was right. I was never going to be satisfied working under florescent lights, striving for research money, publications, tenure or any of the necessary trappings of being a modern scientist. I quit my chemistry thesis right then. Feeling defeated, I started spending all my time in the art building.\n\nFor my first project I shaved my entire body, divided it into sections and took Elmer's glue casts of every square inch of skin. It was a trick I had learned as a boy, and somehow I had no choice but to take it to its logical extreme. All the peeling felt apt given my recent experience with radiation burns. In fact, I developed an obsession with peeling of all kinds. Removing the surface. Having tried and failed as a chemist completed what cancer had started, which was essentially a flipping of foreground and background. The periphery seemed a whole lot more enticing than the center. The great thing about innocence is that it gives you a place to rest. This place was gone, and still is gone. But Art, for all it's stupidity and pretense, feels like a genuine frontier (at it's best). A place where being restless is valuable.\n\nIt's at this point I moved to North Adams, MA and lived on my own for the first time. I'll continue the story from here, moving to NYC, meeting Paul, and making that first track in the next entry\u2026"}
{"text":"Friends: 'Shoot us if we ever change'\n\nFriends, the Brooklyn bred band that are a mixture of indie pop and mutant funk, have just released their alternative video for their new single 'Mind Control', which is full of influences from old movies and the camp eighties. The band's success has recently blossomed and with their debut album finally here, we decided to talk to band member Nikki.\n\nAt the start of their heavy line-up of festivals and tours, we caught up with a very fragile Nikki Shapiro to talk to him about their inspirations, if they would ever alter their originality, how they made the change from colleagues to friends and his best and worst festival experiences\u2026\n\nGigwise: How are you feeling?\n\nNikki: Erm, Are you on loud speaker?\n\nNo\n\nI can hear you in my ear. I'm not feeling so well. Yeh we played Primavera last night and yeh we didn't get much sleep.\n\nOh is it cool to ask you a few questions, up for it?\n\nYeh\n\nOk, so it's almost time for you album to be released, are you all pleased with it?\n\nErrr, pleased with it\u2026 er yes I am but I want to move on to the next thing, it feels good to be finished.\n\nThere were rumours that Samantha wasn't quite happy with it, how true is that?\n\nErm I don't know, feelings change from day to day.\n\nAre you happy with the album? Are there any changes you would make if you could?\n\nErm, no changes.\n\nYou're becoming more and more recognised, would mainstream success be you ultimate goal?\n\nEr, no.\n\nHow do you see the future for the band?\n\nIt would be cool to get some sleep in the future, yeh that's our aim for the future.\n\nWould you ever alter you image for success?\n\nAlter you image for success\u2026\u2026.if I ever do please shoot me.\n\nWhat are your inspirations for the video for your new single 'Mind Control?\n\nEr, well old movies, and the eighties those are kind of campy. That's what we wanted and that's what we were shooting for. Nothing else, I don't watch television, it's terrible.\n\nYou are playing and played a range of festivals including Primavera last night and Field Day, what has been best festival experience?\n\nErm, probably yesterday.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nJust had a really good time, with people, beside the water.\n\nDid you see any other bands you wanted to see?\n\nI, I kinda just erm listened to the music. I saw Chairlift the night before, that was nice.\n\nSo what has your worst festival experience been?\n\nErm, not sleeping and having to interviews the next day.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nNo, no it's my fault.\n\nSo the band all originally worked together in a vegan restaurant, how was the crossover from colleagues to 'Friends'?\n\nI feel that we kept the same dynamic that we already had. The only thing that has changed is that we can't relax at the end of a shift and we can't go home anymore.\n\nAre there any arguments?\n\nNah, not really.\n\nHow do you feel about the food on the road?\n\nYeh, it's really hard. The amount of junk food, all these venues have this snack food, junk food and alcohol. This is not good.\n\nSo what are you hoping to achieve by the end of 2012?\n\nErmmm, I guess finish our shows and then relax, put our feet up and take a few months off before 2013 and re-evaluate who we are.\n\nSo where do you see Friends in five year's time, what are your aspirations?"}
{"text":"Given that Sigur Ros seem to be going to increasing lengths with each record to seem less abstract and more human, a collection that unbinds itself from those constraints is, it turns out, a justifiable and often awe-inspiring exercise.\n\nA very interesting ambience collaboration between the Sigure Ros man and his boyfriend Alex Somers. Unlike Jonsi's solo record, this bears little resemblance to the Sigure Ros sound. It's the kind of music you can immerse yourself in if you were meditating or relaxing somewhere. It really takes you away. It doesn't really have any traditional songs but is made up of a series of sprawling tracks. I'd recommend for pre sleep listening or listening to while in the bath - that's not saying it's boring, its saying its a chillax album.\u2026Collapse"}
{"text":"You are browsing the Blog for rock.\n\nSome bands find a niche they are good at and just to earn more money, they keep doing that same thing over and over again until they run into obscurity. Muse is nothing like those bands. After listening to their newest album, I now understand why being dynamic could be a musician's biggest friend or enemy. In the case of Muse's new album, being dynamic is their best friend. The album took everything I loved about Muse (the Queen-esque power stadium rock, the soul-driven guitar solos, Dominic's and Chris's basic yet moving beats and rhythms, and Matthew Bellamy's haunting lyrics and guitar) and added a new flair to it that made me realize why I listened to them in the first place. The album starts off with a bang. \"Supremacy\" sounds like what would happen if you took Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\" and changed it to be a James Bond theme song. With haunting melodies and dark chords, this incipient portion of this album takes you to a dark place deep in the recesses of your mind full of chaos yearning to be free. The second song \"Madness\" feels like a funk jam, with deeper lyrics and deeper bass. It's like a techno song with soul. When the guitar eventually comes in, it feels just right, as if it had been there the whole time. Once the distorted guitar comes in for the simple yet incredible solo, you can just tell that Matt Bellamy took extra special care in orchestrating this. With particular notes lasting just long enough to leave you wanting more. This song feels like an epic multi-person band's attempt and success at a powerful song with a message, but instead it is only three supreme musicians. When \"Panic Station\" first came on, I thought Chris Bellamy had completely read more\u2026"}

As a flamenco dancer, her influence has led the band to explore new rhythms.\n\n\"Flamenco could be my favourite non-North American music,\" says Whiteman. \"Just because, in itself, it's a blend of a whole lot of things, from gypsy to Arabic music, to Spanish courtly poetry.\"\n\nIt's this awareness of the music around him that Whiteman thinks contributes to Apostle of Hustle's sound. Though they started out playing covers of PJ Harvey, Carlos Jobim and Tom Waits in dive bars in Toronto, much of Apostle of Hustle's genesis is linked to Whiteman's time in Cuba. But Whiteman is resolute in the fact that there isn't a specific Latin sound to their music.\n\n\"We're not purists or anything,\" he says. \"You're not going to hear anything traditionally Cuban in our music. It's more so anything that catches us, really . The tone of someone's voice or the rhythm will often do it. I like to follow music down a path.\n\n\"My whole discovery of Cuban music initially came from me getting really turned on to Bo Diddley.

And then followed it further to Cuban music.\"\n\nAs a self-professed music junkie, Whiteman is self-effacing when it comes to his knowledge. According to Whiteman, it's a matter of constantly listening, researching, questioning and ultimately following the music where it leads.\n\n\"The world-music scene is in a state where you really have to search for something that sounds dope,\" says Whiteman. \"A lot of it sounds super homogenized. They sell it at Starbucks, you know, and it's not inspiring.

And what a debut it is! I do believe that the guys in the band were 15 when this album was recorded which makes this album all the more fantastic! On first listen, you wouldn't guess that Daniel Johns was 15, but he is. So, a buch of kids let loose in a studio with musical instruments, what are they going to sing about? How bad their life is? How poor daddy is? How crap school is? No. Silverchair sing about everything but themselves. My favourite song is \"Israel's Son\" cos it's just so great! At first, Silverchair were dismissed as a \"Nirvana is pyjamas\". After all, they are a three piece and the lead singer does have bolnd hair but that's where the comparisons end cos Silverchair are a breed of their own.

{"text":"In honor of last night's benefit for the National Lawyers Guild at Shea Stadium, the letters \"OWS,\" for \"Occupy Wall Street,\" were haphazardly applied to the wall behind the stage in black tape, the \"O\" specifically incomplete. The PA played radical punk, metal and hip-hop that was socially recognizable\u2014communal, even. When Rage Against the Machine's \"Bombtrack\" trickled out of the speakers, a horizon line of mutual unconscious headbanging sprang up.\n\nTitus Andronicus frontman Patrick Stickles looked gaunt and crazed as he walked across the stage, courting the unselfconscious space between complete wild engagement and weird sensitive coiling. He encouraged the crowd to go wild but within responsible terms, quoting Bob Dylan's \"Absolutely Sweet Marie\": \"To live outside the law\/ You must be honest.\"\n\nTwo minutes into their first song, which grew inexorably from a slow acoustic shuffle into unearned, linear bombast, Stickles yelled \"Fuck!\" The crowd surged. The crashing was big and incredible, a mass of pink chemical aggression, but it had been also weirdly manipulated. Later, to induce a calm moment, Stickles moaned over a keyboard figure for a few minutes; there were two lighters in the air. \"This isn't a Fugazi concert or anything\u2014we're all adults here,\" Stickles said at one point. (His digression emphasized safety from destruction of property and other human beings, which are paramount at Fugazi shows; you are never less of an adult then when you are allowed to inhabit an ecstatic irresponsibility.)\n\nListening to and experiencing Titus Andronicus is like observing from within the ribcage of a dead and stripped giant animal. It is impressively empty, and there is an inarticulate prehistoric distance that is impossible to bridge. The band seems to want to assess tremendous American lore (in their specific case, the Civil War) in the microcosm of New Jersey, which would be a fine idea if it felt like they did any of the work to realize it.\n\nNear the end of Titus's set, someone requested a drinking song. \"This is not a song about fucking drinking,\" replied Stickles, agitated. \"This is a song about fucking justice.\" Titus launched into a brash and unsubtle cover of \"I Fought the Law,\" and then invited Ted Leo and So So Glos vocalist Alex Levine to play Billy Bragg's \"To Have and To Have Not,\" the chorus of which was exchanged among the frontmen: \"Just because you're better than me\/ Doesn't mean I'm lazy\/ Just because you're going forwards\/ Doesn't mean I'm going backwards.\"\n\nIdeas about Occupy Wall Street were in the air, foremost among them the political idea of consistency. In occupying a specific location for a lengthy period of time, protesters effectively buried themselves in a national conversation and physically articulated their willingness to stick to their guns. \"You know how old I am?\" Leo rhetorically asked the crowd. \"You know how many marches I've been on? I get home and I feel great and two days later any media presence evaporates.\"\n\nThe stability of the movement seemed at odds with the instability of the show; Leo's set was loud and unhinged, a predominantly tight band combating sickness and wild sound. \"How are you guys doing?\" Leo asked at one point; \"I'm not at 100 percent tonight,\" he later admitted. Regardless, there was a charm in the loose, untangled way Leo's set hinged on anomie. The bass frequency hummed from what seemed at that point a blown speaker.\n\nLeo had completely degraded vocally but regardless returned for an encore that included songs about the marginalized working class, among them Uncle Tupelo's \"Whiskey Bottle\" and Chumbawumba's \"I Never Gave Up.\" Between songs, he further assessed the Occupy Wall Street movement, and its ideological successes. \"A lot of people have been singing and talking about a lot of issues for a long time,\" Leo said, bright and tired. \"It's great that we finally found that modality.\"\n\nCritical bias: I may or may not have been in the pit for half of Ted Leo's set.\n\nOverheard: The sad-looking punk with toilet paper in his ears can probably double as a sign of how hard it was to hear people.\n\nRandom notebook dump: Shea Stadium is a reminder of the weird unpopulated air that prevails in some desolate and extinct Brooklyn sections. Inside is loft with punk basement pretensions\u2014hard, unyielding floors, a conscious wear in everything from persistent disuse, a tremendous amount of space that is quickly peopled and forgotten. There are also significant ideas about the Mets here\u2014the name, the logo painted on the wall. It feels like a lost, admired space.\n\nive seen titus four times now and 5th for the glos and second for the great ted leo and this was by far THE BEST concert i have ever attended, nothing can even compare to the feelings and frustration at the world and pure joy a titus show can invoke. and buschwick is DEFFINITELY not extinct, its a totally different vibe than yr insencere hipstermall could ever hope to achieve\n\nYeah we're all entitled to our opinions -- this is just one individual's observation of a band he was unfamiliar with, taking notes during their live show, recording his opinions along with some correct info, some wrong info. It's not his opinion on Titus that bothers me (I personally think their music & lyrics are great), but his \"random notebook dump\" on the venue.\n\nThat strange East Williamsburg area is relatively \"extinct\" in terms of thriving industrial activity, but many of those warehouses have been converted into lofts, studios, galleries and in this case, a music venue\/recording studio. The best part of the show was the atmosphere -- a casual DIY venue as opposed to a corporate club with overpriced drinks, strict regulations, a sterile environment, and enforced separation from the performers. This show could have easily been housed in a larger \"proper\" venue in Manhattan or Williamsburg, but that wouldn't have embraced the community-oriented spirit that is inherent in the Occupy movement.\n\nPlus Shea Stadium's sound is superb. Great place to see an artist you like perform. And speaking of....this blogger has no opinions on The So So Glos? They always put on a good show, and there was no mention of their set in this write-up.\n\nI think the sound in Shea is terrible. I mean, short of an efficient PA system, it has the acoustics of a unfinished basement. Which is great for certain shows (okay, seeing a band you forgive because it's such an intimate setting) but I wouldn't really go there to \"check somebody out\".\n\nAs for the Taint of Brooklyn, Meadow St is in a pretty desolate part. Much like Gowanus, the streets are sort of empty, but I do know there is life behind those foreboding walls. The problem is there's nothing to *explore* out there. It's not like Dumbo or the Village. If you're out there, you're going somewhere. Or you're buying drugs.\n\nI've just read now more then I would ever like to read about Titus Andronicus. I mean, I \"get it\" of what they're about, or what their sound is. And it's not my thing. There are plenty of other things. But did I really miss out on a show in what is effectively some dudes loft apartment in taint of Brooklyn? (T'ain't quite Williamsburg, t'ain't quite Bushwick) I'm really happy that people have \"opinions\" about \"things that are rather important\" but honestly I couldn't give a flying fuck about a band derivative of the first 4 years of the early 90s. So sensitive the fandom get when a less than favorable review gets out of the hog pen. Perhaps it's just a subterfuge for people with terrible taste trying to feel something real... But if I speculate any further, I suppose I won't be much different from y'all.\n\nYou need to be familiar with a band's work prior to reviewing them live. You've clearly never listened to Titus Andronicus; if you had, you would know that Stickles yelled \"Fuck You\" and that the song is called \"Fear and Loathing in Mahwah, NJ\". Beyond that, you would understand that the Civil War imagery was a major part of the band's second album The Monitor and that it has more to do with an existential crisis than New Jersey.The irony of claiming that TItus didn't do the work to assess American lore when you didn't even take the time to research the band before reviewing their live show is pretty great.I'll take a cue from Stickles and quote Bob Dylan; \"Don't criticize what you don't understand.\"\n\nWOW you couldn't be more wrong. this was one of the most fun and most communal shows I've ever been to. How dare you say listening to Titus is like being inside a dead animal? And call the industrial part of brooklyn \"extinct\"? In fact it's probably one of the few places left in brooklyn where NYers are earning a living wage!!! And MAKING THINGS rather than selling beer! I am at a loss for words. Why were you sent to a punk show?"}
{"text":"Let's start this one with a sweeping yet thoughtful statement. Derbyshire-based electro-rock-pop duoCrushing Blows are extraordinarily hard to describe. Put it this way, they descrive themselves as 'noise-pop'. That's not even a thing.\n\nThere's so much in their music, it's impossible to listen to it all in one go without missing something. In fact, their latest EP, a self titled record is only four songs long, and yet it seems like they've managed to pack so much into it that they're almost impossible to put into a genre without missing out a huge chunk of the music.\n\nIt might sound from this that Crushing Blows are too technical and too complicated for their own good. Cries of \"it's too complex and overpacked, it'll sound a mess\" would be well reasoned, justified arguments. But they'd also be dead wrong. Opener The People You Will Never Meet sets the tone for the rest of the record \u2013 it has a slow, plodding and yet peaceful feel to it, but there's still elements from thrash (trebly sounding, distorted guitars) to psychedelic funk in there that mix up the sound nicely, don't sound too complicated and make the music hard to classify. It's really talented, and really well done, because this style of music is something that could be quite easily ruined if not properly paid attention to.\n\nThe rest of the EP continues in this fashion, I Dream of Becoming a Girl is a psychedelic, trippy masterpiece of crystallised sounding synthesizers and dance-track-esque basslines that have the capacity either get a listener lying back and relaxing, or on their feet bounding up and down like a loon. In some ways, the music is quite scary.\n\nIssues \u2013 really not many at all, but there's a couple. As a sound, the fact that it's hard to classify(whilst a good thing when it comes to originality) means that some listeners might shy away from it (their loss) because it's not what they're used to. Going deeper into this idea, those who do dare to listen to it might find that it's just too strange to listen to. In Lehman's terms, the music is almost post-modern.\n\nOverall, then a great EP, if a little bit weird and trippy. Nothing wrong with this, though, it will just take a bit of getting used to if Crushing Blows are to make it into the mainstream. Nobody is denying that the guys have songwriting talent, though, they're really onto something that could make them very successful, as well as very expressive. Keep it up, it'd be great to hear more.\n\nTexan music maestro and electro-pop sensation Matthew Dear returns with his new release, tentatively entitled Beams. His fifth studio effortis an easy listen, but it still remains true to the dance-music roots that Dear has made so much effort to stick to.\n\nSpending a few years in Detroit, well known for its contribution to techno music, Dear's retro electronic influence is clear. His is an available yet nostalgic brand of music, certain to appeal to a wide audience. This ease of access has apparently held Matthew Dear in good stead over the years, and Beams is set to be no exception. It's a dynamic and psychedelic record, with a lot of strange sounds in the background that might raise an eyebrow or two on first listen, but in the long run, it's definitely a grower. Beams doesn't really know where to sit \u2013 there's music not unlike to club and dance tracks, vocals not unlike David Bowie or even Marilyn Manson,and percussion in the background that wouldn't sound out of place at a Stomp show. Despite all of this, though, Beamsis on the whole quite pleasant to listen to.\n\nThe 70s and 80s influences that Dear is so famous for relaying are clear. Uplifting synth sounds are used in conjunction with some great padded bass lines that make tracks sound not unlike Eurythmics, darker Vangelis or any similar 80s electro-pop act. It's a throwback; nostalgia for anyone who was in their teens in 1986. It's also an interesting, new direction for the younger listener open to new genres. Above all Beams is an accessible, reflective album that has both clear influences and clear talent.\n\nThere aren't many issues. This is the kind of music that is very clear on what it's meant to sound like: the 'does-exactly-what-it-says-on-the-tin' kind of approach. That's all very well, but if the music is no good the plan is irreparably flawed. Happily Matthew Dear's music is good, so this approach only helps his success. The only real problem is that the nostalgic techno might be dismissed as 'unoriginal' by more cynical listeners.\n\nOverall however this is another success for Dear. It's not like he isn't used to it, but apparently it's not gone to his head, because he's still making great music. In terms of this album, it's just as catchy and just as accessible as it would be if it were to come out in 1985, and that, it seems, is the point.\n\nWith a tagline like 'a savage colossus of sound', anyone in their right mind would be eager to listen to the new single from electronic\/rock artist 'Hooray For Earth', entitled 'Never'. Released on September 24th, first impressions are that it's going to be filling dancefloors everywhere the minute it's released. But is that really the case? It's certainly not David Guetta type music, put it that way.\n\nIt's an uplifting, synth-heavy release, with a catchy vocal line and electronic-strings in the chorus that wouldn't sound out of place if a listener was surrounded by a lot of people, flashing lights and lasers. But it's not necessarily a club-anthem just yet. The drums don't pulse almost painfully in the ears, as is the standard for a lot of dance music, and the focus on the vocals is higher than in a lot of club music, which focuses more on bass.\n\nProblems \u2013 it might not actually be popular with the clubbers among listeners, purely because it's not pure club music. That's a bit unenlightened, though, and for every listener who dismisses 'Hooray For Earth', there will be ten who fall in love with them.\n\nSo it's slightly different, but still fits into the dance scene. The most important thing is that it's good. It's like club music without the headache, and rock music with an added electronic twist that makes it slightly euphoric. It's got a little bit of everything, and certainly does fit into that tagline \u2013 'a savage colossus of sound' very well.\n\nWell Muse havebeen quiet for the last couple of years. 2009 saw the release of their last album, The Resistance, and since then? Not a lot. Not until now, because they're back. The band first made an appearance at the London 2012 Olympic Games Closing Ceremony, which pre-empted a resurfacing from them, and now the British supergroup are releasing a single ahead of their sixth studio album, entitledThe 2nd Law. Entitled Madness, this song is the medium through which Muse have chosen to rear their heads again, and it has to be said, it's very different.\n\nThere was a bit of a scare a couple of months ago when listeners got a preview of the new Muse through YouTube and were worried. \"Oh no!\" came the cries, \"Muse have gone dubstep!\" Well, it looks like those claims have become a bit of a reality. Madness is slow, electronic, pulsing, thudding dance\/dubstep. It does, however, have a lot of redeeming features. It is very, very progressive and yet somehow very classicMuse. It's definitely catchy, it has a great, pulsating beat to it, and vocally it gets listeners singing along with the endlessly repeated \"m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad\" (it looks daft when it's written down) even if they don't like the song.\n\nThe best thing about it, though, is that Madness builds up in a very satisfying way. It sneaks up on a listener and manages to explode into an epic finale section at about three minutes in, without anyone listening actually noticing it's coming until it happens. It's clever, and from then on until the end, the song becomes fantastic.\n\nIt's well titled too because it does seem to epitomise feelings of madness (especially if listened to through large headphones) in musical form. The drums pound very heavily on listeners ears, and there doesn't seem to be any guitar work that isn't smothered in chaotic-sounding effects so much it no longer sounds like a guitar, except for a brief (and well played) solo. As always with Muse, the bass work is phenomenal. Hats off to Chris Wolstenholme, again.\n\nThe vocal work sounds very familiar, very typical Muse, which obviously it would do. But, it also sounds suspiciously like a bit of an ode to Queen. This reviewer wonders if that's deliberate. Do Muse fancy themselves a bit of a new Queen?\n\nBy releasing it ahead of, The 2nd Law, an album due for release on October 2nd 2012 (clever.), Muse are playing a dangerous game, because this is a very love\/hate kind of song. Fans of the old Muse, where the main instrument was a guitar rather than a synthesizer (Origin of Symmetry) aren't going to like this song. At all. But that's not the point, is it? Muse are moving on, experimenting with new sounds, and expecting the true fans of their music to come along for the ride. As well they should. It's different from the Devon rockers, but not necessarily bad. Muse are drawing a line under their older material and beginning a new phase of their musical career. And we as listeners should all watch with interest, these guys aren't done yetIt seems like the trend these days is to create rock\/electronic music, a fusion of two very different genres. This is something that Israeli club duo Rendezvous seem to have unwittingly managed quite successfully with their latest release, club\/electronica compilation Another Round Please. Recorded in the midst of violent conflict in the middle of Israel, it's a euphoric electronic release that's set to soon be successfully occupying club dance floors everywhere.\n\nFrom the off, there's no element in particular that's special about the music that Rendezvous have made; other than that it's all just really rather good. It's got plenty to keep the listener occupied \u2013 it starts off with a pulsating bassline and sparkly-sounding electronic sounds that have the power to catch the attention of the unsuspecting listener and draw them in within a matter of seconds, and this theme continues throughout the whole album. The use of synths is excellent, not too over the top and not used too sparingly so that it's too rare, it's just right.\n\nIt's definitely not your everyday, run-of-the-mill club music, though. It has salutes to some of the lighter artists of the electronic persuasion, not just thudding basslines and bass-drums, like Kraftwerk, Jarre or Vangelis. It's not as heavy-sounding as normal club music, it's a lighter, more trance-esque sound that gives it a club feel without the pounding on the eardrums. It's a more uplifting, euphoric mix than general dance music. The rock elements mentioned earlier take a slight backseat as the album progresses to make way for the electronic sounds at the forefront, but there's some band-like elements in there for good measure to keep up the rock-side of the music, such as the use of an acoustic drum kit on Prisoner which keeps it sounding 'real' despite it being mostly electronic. It's very well done, and a good word to describe some of the synth sounds would be 'sparkling' or 'glittering'.\n\nLimitations \u2013 repetitiveness is always an issue with this type of music, and Another Round Please is no exception. Rendezvous have found their formula on this album and stuck with it. It consists of a catchy bassline, drums to match and electronic synth sounds over the top, and this is the format that remains for almost all the songs on the album, which can get slightly 'samey' as the album progresses. Once a listener has heard one song on this album, there's a tendency to say that they have heard the rest, although the melodies differ enough for each song to be easily distinguishable from the others, so this might be a slightly cynical view.\n\nOverall, then, it's a crystalline fusion of electronica, club and a small amount of rock music that's sure to inspire the dance scene into taking notice. It's ambitious and yet the same as what's already been done at the same time, which is no mean feat. Recorded under intense pressure, Rendezvous seem to have kept their cool and produced something innovative and pleasing to the ear that is sure to set them apart from some of the other dance artists of today. In fact, it might even inspire a reformation of the old electronica classics watch\n\nThe obvious comparison one could make with this release would be to Jean Michel-Jarre. It's got ghostly, haunting electrical sounds that have the capability to make the hairs stand up on the back of one's neck. This comparison to Jarre, whilst not completely incorrect, might be a bit unfair, however. Lovelorn sounds like a lot of thought and effort has gone into it, and to generalise it like that immediately wouldn't really be reasonable. It's fresh sounding and has a very 'sparkly' feel to it. 'Sparkly' isn't exactly a technical term but it's the word that describes the sound best. Arnstr\u00f6m uses his instruments and synths very cleverly to create something very atmospheric, not pretentious and uplifting. It's 'bassy' without weighing on the listeners' ears', which is no mean feat. This sets it aside from dance music or drum and bass, releasing it from the shackles that would otherwise tie it to these other genres. It's free to breathe easily and along the same lines is extremely easy to listen to.\n\nThe first track on the EP, Free Agent, doesn't really set the tone for the rest of the tracks; it's much more upbeat and has more pace than the rest of the songs, reminiscent of a disco (it even speaks slightly of the Bee Gees in some ways). Though some might see this as a bad thing, it's really quite misleading and it could be said that the rest of the album is a slight let down after this promising opening. The other tracks are much more melancholy, a lot slower and deeper. The 'sparkling' sound doesn't go away either \u2013 it's prevalent throughout the whole EP, giving it a vague feeling of entirety. It makes very good background music and wouldn't go amiss at a party either, making it an accessible and potentially very popular release. It caters to a very wide audience in a variety of situations.\n\nBecause of its accessibility, consistency and obvious talent that it took to create this release, it deserves a very good 6\/10.\n\nLondon's dance scene gets a refreshing boost with the release of Around the Sun, the debut offering from Monarchy, popular Techno\/House artists. New, dedicated techno music has been thin on the ground in recent years, so Monarchy have taken advantage of a lack of competition and broken their way onto the scene in a big way. They put their name into the history books forever in June 2010, broadcasting the first ever live show directly into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Monarchy have also remixed tracks by some very upmarket artists, such as Ellie Goulding and Lady GaGa, to get their proverbial foot in the door, and so their first studio release was very anticipated. Said debut album was released on July 11th 2011, and, on first listen, it lives up to its expectations.\n\nMonarchy have a unique method of blending constant, band-esque lead vocals with soulful and uplifting, synth based pulses of music, and to be honest, it's really pleasant to listen to. It works on this album extremely well, and it's very good to hear a new take on the genre, which some could argue is tired and stagnated. Some house and dance music pulses very heavily and weighs a lot on the eardrums, eventually becoming an unpleasant experience for the listener. Not so with Around the Sun. It's uplifting, epic sounding dance music, and without the vocals, it could even pass for trance music. The vocal part of the music is ever at the forefront of it, it's constant, verse-to-chorus and back again singing, an unorthodox trait for dance music, which has always heavily focussed on the beats and synths. It's a refreshing change, one which makes the music much easier to listen to, and which makes the music itself much more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nThe only problem I would find with this album is its relevance to the scene that it aims at. Dance music is more often than not found within bars and clubs, and the absence of pulsating bass-lines and ear-throbbing punches might make it hard for this type of music to fit into that scene if it were ever to go into the mainstream. This might make it less popular with the masses. This could be a small problem though, as Monarchy have already played several open-air festivals and countless shows, including The Big Chill and at top venue XOYO. Overall, this album is a respectable and experimental first release from the ambitious Monarchy, an experiment that has paid off for them. It's a sensual, uplifting and trance inducing dance experience, and for what it is, I won't hesitate to give it a very good 7\/10."}
{"text":"MGMT\n\nby Wendy Ding: IllustrationAt last, my illustration of MGMT is complete! I captured the band in a visual fashion akin to the sound they're famous for: kaleidoscopically psychedelic.\n\nI've been meaning to illustrate in a format other than the standard square or rectangle. The circle felt perfect since it's representative of the kaleidoscope viewfinder and it's the shape of a vinyl record so there's an added tie to the music theme. I gave each band member a plethora of colours scattered with geometric shapes and a prism for the kaleidoscope effect. Also in the mix are corresponding music instruments!\n\nThe most fun and challenging part was fitting the funky shapes and instruments into the prism while looking like a kaleidoscope and not overshadowing the band members. I practically lived in a kaleidoscope for a week rearranging and tweaking the opacity, tilt and size of each shape. It was certainly a labour of love! Now, back to fondly waiting for their third album\u2026"}
{"text":"Cloud Nothings\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Dylan Baldi was an 18-year-old college student studying saxophone and sound recording at a small college near Cleveland, OH. He had played in bands around town since he was old enough to hold a guitar, but recently he'd been putting his solo music on record through the magic of home recordings. He titled the solo project \"Cloud Nothings,\" made a myspace page, friended some bands he liked, and sat back to wait.\nThat's when a certain NYC show promoter known for putting on shows in unorthodox venues emailed asking if Cloud Nothings wanted to play with buzz bands Real Estate and Woods at the Market Hotel. This happened to be the same date that Dylan had to play a mandatory performance with his college band or end up failing the class, which put him in the awkward position of having to decide if it was worthwhile to drop out of college to play a very first show with a non-existent band that had only been written about on a couple blogs and heard by a few people.\nWe are most grateful for his decision."}
{"text":"MWE puts a modern and eclectic twist on Turkish and Balkan folk music. This acoustic wind ensemble plays traditional songs with the rarely paired clarinet and the double-reeded zurna. Add some clarinets and a Davul, a shoulder slung marching drum, and you're about the closest to heavy metal you can get without amplification. Their shows are loud, wild and raucous affairs known for drawing entire audiences on their feet in one song or less.\n\nTrue Life Trio weaves sumptuous vocal harmonies and sultry rhythms from Eastern Europe, the Americas & beyond. TLT explores the creative possibilities of cross-fertilization of different traditions with unlikely timbres connecting Bulgaria to the Bayou.\n\nTLT's improvisation-laced repertoire includes original songs and folk tunes from far-flung lands such as Macedonia, Louisiana, Albania, South Africa, Ukraine, Mexico, Poland, Italy and Georgia. The trio delves deep into the vast array of folk music that lends itself to three-part vocal harmony, massaging and expanding the boundaries of these traditional styles. The result is a sweet, sonic explosion that melts in the listener's ear."}

Glen Hansard is the leader and primary songwriter for both of these acts, and he's now put out a long awaited solo album, Rhythm and Repose, that plays out many of the characteristics that made his work with The Frames and The Swell Season so powerful while still adding just enough new sounds to make for an album that stands with the rest of his works.\n\n\"You Will Become\" opens the album and sounds exactly like a Swell Season track and it has Marketa Irglova on backing vocals and piano. It's a very good way to open the album, but like most of the fist half of Rhythm and Repose there's too much familiarity with other Hansard work. \"Maybe Not Tonight\" cries out like many Frames songs and \"Talking To The Wolves\" also goes down the same road, although the percussion keeps the song moving and interesting.\n\nHansard isn't the strongest songwriter, the thing that's always made his songs work are the way he delivers his powerful vocals. And that talent is on full display on many of these tracks. \"High Hope\" is a paper thin song that would have fallen to pieces in anyone else's hands. The same criticism can be made on the slow ballad, \"Bird of Sorrow\". The song is filled with strings and an odd mixture of optimism and sadness that showed up frequently with The Frames.\n\nWhile the first batch of songs on Rhythm and Repose doesn't much to add to Hansard's catalog, most of the songs are forgiven by the remarkable set of songs that comes afterword, starting with \"The Storm, It's Coming\". Once again, Hansard's lyrics are quite see-through, but with such a compelling voice that sounds so sure of it's message, you can't help but be moved. The song is filled strings that bring the mood of dread that something bad is bound to happen even closer, although Hansard doesn't bring anything direct to the song that makes it close enough for the listener.\n\n\"Love Don't Leave Me Waiting\" is a very upbeat song that might be the best one on Rhythm and Repose that brings to mind Van Morrison's Moondance with Hansard's voice and the horns. The dread of \"The Storm, It's Coming\" rears it's head again on \"What Are We Gonna Do\" that's almost even darker with some very slow guitar with haunting strings in the background. And while the song starts off very compelling, it carries on for too long and loses it's feeling towards the end.\n\nThere's more than just acoustic songs here that bring The Swell Season to mind, there's several moments where added instrumentation makes all the difference. \"Races\" adds in some organ and banjo that keeps the song from being weak. \"Come Away To The Water\" also has banjo, and it almost comes out like a country song but Hansard's style of songwriting keep the song out country territory. \"Philanderer\" has some very rapid piano at the beginning with Hansard going into a very soft delivery that's reminiscent of Peter Gabriel.\n\nPeople already familiar with Hansard's previous work will find plenty here to enjoy, yet it might not be the best place to start for people who aren't as knowledgeable with Hansard's other groups. Rhythm and Repose has Hansard doing what he does best, and having a few missteps along the way. But there's just enough emotionally engaging tracks to keep this album from being a bland solo venture."}
{"text":"Dusted Reviews\n\nCulture Shock\n\nThere is a human tendency to fear that which is totally foreign, hence most of the sociopolitical problems in the world. However, if the foreign is combined with the familiar to make it more palatable, the opposite is true. It becomes \"exotic,\" and we praise ourselves for our tolerance and understanding of other cultures. Ultra Fuckers come from Japan, home of the delightfully quirky (the broken-English slogan \"We are psychedelic warrior\" is emblazoned across the cover). Their aesthetic is not particularly foreign, as the desire to play guitars really loud and piss off old people apparently transcends culture. But they seem perfectly willing to hide behind willful inaccessibility, content to be \"exotic\" instead of good.\n\nI refuse to spend more time writing about the music of Ultra Fuckers than they spent writing and recording it, so I've got about fifteen minutes to summarize. The songs straddle the line between the traditional and the experimental. They are structured like garage punk numbers, verse chorus verse chorus, but whereas punk depends on immediacy and directness to grab the listener, the music of Ultrafuckers seems vague and formless, hidden by a miasma of poor production (more on this later) and a total lack of dynamics. The overall effect is a constant blare, an almost ambient drone of distorted guitar, flailing drums, and hoarse shouts. They are straining to be loud and obnoxious, but the music is almost impossible to pay attention to. It begs to be ignored. Things pick up slightly in the middle, when the tempo slows and the singer shuts up for a few minutes. \"German Rock Radio II\" adds keyboards, \"Lets Go Space Beach\" features surf-signifying reverb guitar, and \"Long Number #2\" is essentially the guitar player teaching himself how to use the delay pedal. The sonics of these songs are an improvement over the frantic monotony of the rest, but since Ultra Fuckers still neglect to write any actual songs, they're just fancy frosting on a sugar-free cake.\n\nBeyond the Fuckless contains some of the most truly awful production I have ever heard in my life. Not in a gritty, in-the-red kind of way, but in a $20 boom box wrapped in a blanket kind of way. The album sounds like every piece of equipment used in the recording process, from instruments to microphones to tape to vinyl, was made of cardboard. It takes either a tremendous effort or a complete disregard for the process to make a recording sound this bad, and since Ultra Fuckers took the trouble to get their album released, I'm inclined to believe the effect is intentional.\n\nThe whole thing stinks of a scam, a lure for those who believe that if it's Japanese, \"psychedelic,\" loud, on a tiny label, and sounds like crap, it's inherently good. From the minimal packaging to the primitive music contained within, this album by Ultra Fuckers seems tailor-made for those indie rock fans who fetishize the obscure and unpleasant.

{"text":"Speech [EMI]\n\nAlbum Review\n\nSpeech disbanded Arrested Development after the failure of Zingalamaduni, the band's second album, embarking on a solo career. As it turned out, it wasn't dissimilar from his former band at all. Speech, his eponymous 1996 debut, followed the same peaceful, soulful vibe that informed Arrested Development's two studio albums in a more tempered fashion. Where his former group sounded rootsy and gritty even at their most laid-back, Speech's record sounds slick, generally lacking in funk or dirt. Speech is not as immediate or infectious as 3 Years, but it is certainly more focused than Zingalamaduni. That sense of direction is a welcome relief after the confused mess of Arrested Development's farewell but Speech needs to write more shots of energy like \"Ghetto Sex\" in order to win back his audience. [EMI also released a version of the album.]"}

{"text":"Review\n\nThe Magnetic Fields head honcho Stephin Merritt has commented that Distortion's peculiar aesthetic\u2014purposely feeding back every non-percussive instrument on the record, including pianos, strings, and accordions\u2014is an attempt to \"sound more like Jesus and Mary Chain than Jesus and Mary Chain.\" Why Merritt would choose to mimic the sound of a lesser band whose day in the sun was 20 years ago and who took most of its cues from earlier, greater artists (Phil Spector, Velvet Underground) may have something to do with the relatively lukewarm reception to his post-69 Love Songs output. The subdued i was wonderful but underappreciated, the Gothic Archies and Future Bible Heroes projects were often excellent but perhaps too jokey, and I don't think anyone actually bought Showtunes. So what's a mad genius\u2014or a grouchy genius, anyway\u2014to do except pull a Dylan at Newport and make some noise?\n\nThe problem is that Merritt's more of a Sondheim than a Dylan. Any arrangement of his songs that obscures rather than stresses the lyrics or melodies seems to be self-defeating. For that matter, the Magnetic Fields are no Jesus and Mary Chain (or My Bloody Valentine or Ride, for that matter), and rather than craft the feedback into elegant walls of noise the way great shoegaze bands did, the instruments on Distortion just clang together cacophonously. It's a strange and far from successful motif for a Magnetic Fields album, but it's also why the Fields sound livelier than any of Merritt's projects have for years. It really is like as if Sondheim tried to replicate the Jesus and Mary Chain; he wouldn't get it quite right, but he'd get something right.\n\nAnd Distortion gets a lot right. First, these are taut, concise pop songs of the '60s girl-group and surf-rock variety, and they're all well served by sticking to a strict three-minute limit. Second, Merritt's frequent collaborator Shirley Simms, whose reassuring alto handles Merritt's quirky lyrics better than anyone, sings about half of the record, and Simms's coo rises quite wonderfully above the din, illuminating Merritt's greatest strength: his compositions (I doubt anyone will write a more gorgeous melody than the refrain to \"Drive On, Driver\" for some time). Breakup duet \"Please Stop Dancing\" is similarly addictive and \"The Nun's Litany\" encapsulates just how incredibly dense Merritt's songs are: It's an erotic laundry list that's sexy, hilarious, sad, coy, cute, and probably a dozen other adjectives too. \"Litany\" is the highlight of a record that no one will mistake for the highlight of Merritt's discography (that's still 69 Love Songs), but which is nonetheless a welcome addition."}

{"text":"Few would have thought that one contestant on Canadian reality show 'Star Search' would have become a global musical giant. Few could have seen what Alanis Morisette would become though.\n\nBack in 1995, with the release of game-changing alum Jagged Little Pill, Alanis became a worldwide sensation, selling over 33 million copies of the album and collecting more platinum discs than a most giant artists get in their lifetime. She continued to sell millions of records over the next decade, until deciding to take a bit of break after 2008's Flavours of Entanglement.\n\nNow she's back with her new album Havoc and Bright Lights and we got to chat with her about the new album, being brave in songs and what it was like at the centre of the music world in the nineties.\n\nSo, what does it feel like to be back on the music scene?\n\nIt feels great, I liken it to coming out from under a rock and getting out of my sweat pants and putting my 15 inch heels back on. It's great!\n\nWhat can we expect then from Havoc and Bright Lights?\n\nAs always, it's a snapshot of this particular time in my life. I'm a Gemini by trade, so I'm always obsessed with the dark and the light aspects of human beings and of life itself. So I comment on the under belly and the addiction and recovery, disconnection and suffering but I also comment on empathy and connecting, feeling and exaltation.\n\nHow does it feel having come back to a sold out tour and the album being so keenly anticipated?\n\nIt's awesome! I just think of different climates. I've just continued to do the same thing for twenty years basically. I show up and I make sure I write a record that's a great indicator of what's happening in my life to the point of when I'm 108 years old on my death bed and my records will be markers of time. So, there are different contexts as well for what people want to hear. I think in the 60s and 70s people wanted to hear about social and political commentary.\n\nThe 80s were about entertainment, the 90s were about emotional commentary through imagery especially. Then the 2000s were about entertainment again, the economies were booming, so people just wanted to check out and have fun. Now I'm happy to say that I think there's more emotional and spiritual commentary that I think people are looking for in music.\n\nWhat's the reaction been to the new tracks so far?\n\nGreat! We opened up in Europe with Woman Down. Nobody knew it, but it felt really good.\n\nBack in 1995, what was like when Jagged Little Pill became a smash hit?\n\nIt was overwhelming. But it was also connective in some instances that I saw it as often as the case may be when people are in pain they think only they're going through it. I know I did when I was young. When I found out that so many people related to my human experience I felt les lonely, which was nice. But as I said, I was overwhelmed. The nineties was an intense time to be selling records and to be really famous.\n\nDid you feel under massive pressure coming off that album?\n\nYeah, yeah I did! It got to the point when I couldn't go to the grocery store or anywhere outside of my house without people saying 'When are you putting your next record out!' So I went to India and tried to escape it as best as I could. The odd person on a train would recognise me, but for the most part I was pretty anonymous again, which was lovely.\n\nI was and still am a people watcher. So, all of a sudden everyone's eyes were looking at me and I thought 'Wait a minute, this isn't my favourite direction.' Apart from when I'm on stage being a ham y'know. I like to sit on park benches and just watch. I still have some sort of PTSD from it or sure.\n\nWhy did you decide to go to India?\n\nI just wanted to step away and to be honest I'm an empath, I'm highly sensitive temperamentally, introverted in that I'm very enquiry minded but with enough extrovert in me to get me out on stage and have me be a very brave, cape-wearing girl. It's probably the Gemini thing. I needed to get away and calm my senses and get away from the overstimulation that was my life. Frankly, it still is.\n\nYou started off as a dance-pop artist, what triggered the shift in musical styles?\n\nIt was more of me not knowing I could integrate all of the styles. That's what I love about this record is that there's the hip-hop, technological loop aspect, there's the rock and roll, sweaty, earthy, fire aspect. Bringing Joe Chiccarelli in producer wise with Guy Sigsworth let us blend and integrate them all.\n\nWhereas when I was a teenager I thought, I can only write a pop record, or a dance record, or the more autobiographical singer-songwriter stuff. Everything was really compartmentalised, whereas my dream was to integrate them all. I feel this record is a nice culmination towards that end.\n\nYour songs have always worn their hearts on their sleeves. Have you ever been tempted to pull back a little?\n\nNo, there's such freedom in art for me and my main goal was to take the same courage that I applied in my song writing process and apply it to my day to day relationships. For a long time if I had had conflict or trouble, then I'll just write a song about it so I didn't have to talk to the person about it. So there was a cowardice that was permeating that whole time. Even though people were telling me how brave I was, in my actual relationships I wasn't very brave at all.\n\nSo that's what's been going on over the last few years too, me being a little bit more direct with my anger and authenticity in my actual relationships. The songs are always going to be authentic and direct.\n\nSo in your time off, you've entered the jungle that is motherhood. How's that been for you?\n\nIt's a hormonal rollercoaster. It's thrown me back into my body, before I had a tendency to be lofty and a little other worldly in some senses. This slammed me back into my body, as there's no more animal an experience than having another human being come out of you. It's pretty surreal and a wild ride.\n\nYou've sometimes described yourself as an alpha female, do you think that's helped you?\n\nIt's definitely helped me. That tomboy quality has always helped me. Y'know that whole Joan of Arc, cape-wearing quality. At the same time patriarchy was and still is what it was and is. Writing songs like Woman Down and continuing to connect with women and have sort of commentary on what our world is looking like is still really important.\n\nSo, what was it like when Kevin Smith asked you to play God in the film Dogma?\n\nWell, I've always believed that we're all piece of God anyway. So, I just asked him what direction he had for me and he just shook his head and said 'Just go be God, don't worry about it. Just do whatever you want.' So, God would definitely have to have a sense of humour, be whimsical and be really, really sweet and kind.\n\nAnd lastly, how many times have people been annoying about the irony in Ironic?\n\nMany times, but there's been some really smarty pants people in New York especially who come up to me and say 'The sweetest part of Ironic, the greatest irony is that it's not filled with irony.' You can blame me and Glen Ballard about that until you're old and grey!\n\nAlanis Morissette's new album Havoc and Bright Lights is out on CD and download on August 27th."}

{"text":"Reel Big Fish \u2013 Candy Coated Fury Review\n\nHappiness is easily achieved when soundtracked by ska. It's a long proven fact. Add sunshine to the mix and who needs Prozac?\n\nUnfortunately for most of the world though, Summer comes but once a year and ska doesn't make all that much sense when the Heaven's are pissing on your parade in a cold South Westerly direction. Unless.\n\nUnless beer is involved. Cue a montage of me, my friends and I skanking our little hearts out on a sweat drenched dancefloor at 4 in the morning, smiles from ear to ear and inaudible belly laughs when someone eventually pushes the skank to slippery floor ratio.\n\nAlcohol aside, don't worry it's not out of reach-just not the main focal point for the moment, it's sunshine that really sells ska. You can believe in brass when there's an enormous ball of gas burning brightly in the sky uninhibited. So it's with perfect timing then that Reel Big Fish make their long awaited return to original material. This being their first studio album of new material in five years.\n\nPerfect timing to the week even, this having just been the most gloriously sunny week in some time, and despite a forecast of rain that was lived up to during the small hours of this morning, it's a sunny week that seems to be welcomely overstaying. Shortly after writing this review, I shall be making the most of the finest beer gardens the Valleys have to offer. Then regret it when I have to wake at an offensively early time tomorrow and put up with shit from people like you on the phones.\n\nSeven studio albums in and 20 years down the line. Reel Big Fish are a little long in the tooth now. Line up changes aside, listening to Candy Coated Fury you could so easily be listening to band's follow up to 1998's Why Do They Rock So Hard? Not their seventh album, fourteen years later.\n\nThis is something the band know themselves; so says founding member and principal songwriter Aaron Barrett, \"We're finally just doing what Reel Big Fish does best, and that's what we did on those first two albums.\"\n\nNow, that could be taken a little the wrong way; writing off their discography since then, trying to perhaps recapture former glory, living in the past. I'll be honest, there's a little bit of that. There are moments that sound overly familiar, or 'fresh' from the tail end of the 90s. That's the thing about ska though, and punk for that matter, they have their sound and they're sticking to it. Reliving their youth or not, there was a strong possibility of some sameyness.\n\nWhat the key point to note is, that they have actually managed to recapture that youthful energy. Past glory, that's another story, but that energy and bite, definitely. Opener Everyone Else is an Asshole displays this straight away, boasting woahs, staccato brass and some genuine punk pace. Add into that some contrarily snarky and bitter lyrics by way of genuinely catch vocals, this could sit so easily aside Sell Out.\n\nSome tracks stand out more than others; the bittersweet though catchy as Hell She's Not the End of the World, the almost college rock bitter break up song I Know You Too Well to Like You Anymore, the standoffishly Summery I Dare You To Break My Heart, the essentially instrumental classic ska and two tone referencing Don't Stop Skankin' that sounds like Madness and signs off with a nod to The Specials and then the riff driven PS I Hate You.\n\nAs said, there are more than a few intentional or unintentional nods to the past, the faint whiff of familiarity, some songs just don't hit home and there's a concern these boys are consciously trying sound like and relive their first two albums. In other genres that could be a real problem, but whether it's the case or not here doesn't matter.\n\nThis isn't the deepest meaning of genres, no, what it is though is fun. It's that party animal you love to invite barbecues, because they just get better when they're around. That's what ska-punk is, and for that this album does its job. It's fun, and what more could you ask for? So quit bitching, pull on your board shorts, grab a beer and get outside. It's Summer."}

{"text":"Listen Here: Heroin in Tahiti\n\nListen Here: Heroin in Tahiti\n\nCowboys, Italian radical design and surf rock - welcome to the world of Heroin in Tahiti.\n\nThis Roman noise\/experimental duo first came to my attention early this year with the release of their debut LP, Death Surf - a soundscape of stormy guitars and crashing waves punctuated by percussion straight out of a spaghetti western. Their sound suggests a grainy recording of a Gidget movie over Alexander Jodorowsky's El Topo. Full of contradiction, it's peaceful with an air of impending danger, equally blissful and threatening.\n\nThe artwork shows no band members or live photos, just a deeply unsettling and powerful image of picture-postcard Polynesia with faces distorted into ghostly blurs. Everything appealed to my love of the morbid and surreal, so I decided to delve into the mind of its creators.\n\nWho is Heroin in Tahiti? Where do you come from and how did you get started?\n\nHeroin In Tahiti is Francesco and Valerio. We live in Rome and we used to play in other bands\/projects in the local noise\/weird\/underground scene. Nowadays, Francesco still plays with Opium Child, while Valerio is half of Thetlvmth and the videolabel AAVV. We also do a sort of gathering called Rainforest: we ask bands to play in Rome and to propose a collection of pics, images and ephemera related to their own universe. These pics are collected in a series of 'zines released by our friend Massimiliano Bomba from RawRaw Editions.\n\nIs there a healthy music scene in Rome at the moment then?\n\nIt seems so. Last year, our friend Toni Cutrone from No=Fi Recordings released a compilation LP called Borgata Boredom, a sort of manifesto of the so called \"Scena di Roma Est\" (East Rome scene). A lot of our friends and neighbours do music, and usually it's the kind of music that we like: noisy stuff, abstract electronics, garagey shit, experimental beats and so on. For example The Away Team\/Polysick, Trans Upper Egypt, Grip Casino, Hiroshima Rocks Around, Wolf Anus, Bobsleigh Baby, System Hardware Abnormal. Lots of different sounds, but the attitude is more or less the same. They're among our best friends, and we're among their biggest fans.\n\nWhat was the idea behind the name 'Heroin in Tahiti'?\n\nYou know, it's just a stupid name. We had this track called Death Surf, and basically Heroin in Tahiti is in the same vein. It also has a sort of Mondo-Movie flavour, the kind of 'obscure things happen in a heavenly place' vibe. Actually, we've never been to Tahiti.\n\nHow is your music influenced by your city?\n\nHard to say. You know, Rome is a very dirty, fucked up and decayed city. There's ruins (both ancient and modern) everywhere, but if this affects our music is up to the listener. Also, Rome has an impressive history in music and weird sounds \u2013 think of Morricone, Nuova Consonanza, Le Stelle di Mario Schifano, the whole library music\/soundtrack thing. And of course you have cinema, Pasolini and so on.\n\nWhere does the interest in the surf rock sound come from?\n\nYou can't resist a twangy guitar.\n\nHow does your interest in Italian radical design fit into your music, if at all?\n\nSuperstudio, Archizoom, Ettore Sottsass, Mendini and the whole radical architecture and design of the 60s\/70s was a very interesting product of a specific era, when Italy was filled with suchexperiments. Same years when Piero Piccioni wrote his proto-industrial\/techno score for Francesco Rosi's The Mattei Affair, or Italian TV broadcast disturbing hallucinatory programmes such as Il Segno del Comando. Of course, back then we weren't even born and we actually grew up in a totally different era, but somehow those elements are part of our cultural background. It's not about memories, it's just living in a place where you can still face those signs everyday.\n\nIf Death Surf was a soundtrack, who would be directing the movie and who'd play the main character?\n\nIt would be a Luigi Bazzoni movie with Florinda Bolkan as the main character. Exactly like the marvellous Le Orme (Footprints on the Moon)."}
{"text":"Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke describes this song as his most political work. \"Harrowdown Hill,\" is part of Yorke's solo album, \"The Eraser,\" which released in August 2006. After seeing the short films of Chel White, Yorke sought him out to direct his next music video.\n\nWhite, who is co-founder of Bent Image Lab in Portland, OR, chose to incorporate an innovative technique that he and the rest of the Bent artists had been researching previous to this project. Dubbed Smallgantics, the technique takes footage of large objects (rivers, factories, city skylines) and makes them appear as though they are actually miniatures. In \"Harrowdown Hill,\" Chel used aerial footage from the pacific north west to be miniaturized using Smallgantics.\n\nThe process involves splitting the footage up into several vertical planes that move back over the perceived z-axis, or into the image along its perceived depth. These planes are then affected with varying degrees of blur to simulate a shallow depth of field. If done right, the amount of blur increases smoothly as it moves along the planes of the image. Next, these levels of blur are animated to simulate a change in focus or to compensate for the forward movement of the camera"}
{"text":"Kevin Devine is in the prime of his life. Having cut five studio albums and numerous EPs, the 31-year-old New Yorker is getting ready to release 'Between the Concrete and Clouds,' a mature record that's chock-full of political allusions and osmotic experiences. Spinner caught up with Devine in the days after Osama bin Laden's death to discuss his reaction to the news, the album and the gentrification of his New York City neighborhood.\n\nYou've often been described as having political lyrics. Have you been inspired within recent weeks and days on anything happening in the news?\n\nHa! Like what? Whatever could you mean? I haven't written anything about that -- yet. You know, I don't know that I will or wouldn't. I tend to write about social issues or my feelings about certain political ideologies, kind of more in a respective way than a reactionary way. It also tends to crop up in the context of discussing it and about, I don't know, life in general.\n\nListen to Kevin Devine's 'Part of the Whole'\n\nThat story's so big, so complex. It would be really hard to avoid being oversimplified or trying to find something clever to say about it for the sake of saying something. I have my thoughts about it. I have my feelings about it. But so does everybody alive who's aware of it right now. I mean who really gives a s--- what everyone thinks about stuff like that? I don't know what I have to say about it is any more important than a 17-year-old girl who wants to write on her Facebook wall about it.\n\nWhat's the concept behind 'A Part of the Whole?'\n\nI was reading about [this] big condo that went up on Ludlow street and Houston street [in New York City], the gentrification, for lack of a less blind word. But what's happened to that part of New York and New York in general [is it's] becoming something more out of 'Gossip Girl' than what it was for a really long time. Places like the Pink Pony and Max Fish, they were probably seen as gentrifying agents at the time when they came up around the early '80s, but I would go to those places because they had a personality and they were part of a neighborhood that felt like something and didn't feel as whitewashed and homogenized. Those places closed down or are closing down because they can't afford to keep the rents open because the landlords can charge whatever they want.\n\n[That's what led to] the part in the second and third verses, \"While you're waving goodbye, crowds group with white flags\/Prospectors lined up in cuffed jeans and messenger bags.\"\n\nWatching these places close, watching these kind of cultural memory artifacts get sent out to sea felt like it gave the song a focus. I don't write really pointed [and] political. I write more about what it means in a person's emotional life, dealing with those discrepancies and being a person. You are somebody who has got to try to let go of the stuff you can't change, but also acknowledging that things do have to f---ing change. I don't know how to make it seem peaceful in my head sometimes. The song was about that. Then it [took on] a more specific shape as an example of that war inside yourself -- about watching all that stuff happen. Well, what am I supposed to do? What is anyone supposed to do about watching these places close down and watching the city change and become this playground for rich people? Because I also like to have these cool little cafes in my neighborhood, and so does everybody else.\n\nIs this a major theme on the upcoming record or is it comprised of several themes?\n\nThe major difference stylistically is it's the first record I've ever made that is a full-band record. There's no song that's just me and an acoustic guitar. Some of the thematic differences are more apparent musically. There's definitely going to be some stuff that branches out and is more kind of spacey and atmospheric.\n\nI wanted to make a really listenable record that teams up with the kind of lyrical content I deal with. I wanted to make something that was a 40-minute, 10-song record -- the kind you finish and want to start over again, like a Ramones record or a Strokes record or something. Not that the songs sound anything like the Strokes or the Ramones.\n\nIn terms of the lyrical content, I feel like that's what I've been writing about to varying degrees of sophistication and success and varying levels of specificity and at times intentionally avoiding specificity -- I feel like these are the kinds of things I've been writing about forever. They change as your experience personally changes. It changes when you get older. I've always written about what it's like to be a person and about the relationship between hope and despair and the relationship between the impulse to say \"f--- it\" and the impulse to say that I want to take on more responsibility of being a person in the world. So, iin a kind of loose way, I've been writing a new record for 10 years. I don't really write about a blind kid who plays pinball or something.\n\nThere are songs on the record where I kind of branch out a little bit. There's one song called 'Awake in the Dirt' that's about 'American Pastorol' by Phillip Roth. There's a character there, Mary Levov, who's the main character's daughter and she's kind like this prism through which he was writing about the change in America through the Civil Rights Movement to now -- some of the mutation and some of the darker parts of our collective consiousness. I wanted [to write about] that character who fascinated me.\n\nI'm not like Colin Meloy or something. He reads these Japanese poems from the 16 century and it makes him write a whole concept record of songs. I don't do that. I was moved to write my perception of what this woman was, how she saw activism and terrorism. I thought it was a really direct parallel between this fictional character and those things in the current climate -- what activism and terrorism look like to one person. There are also love songs, and about lost love, and \"when am I gonna get my s--- in gear and get my life together?\" songs -- which are what I think a lot of people feel when they're writing.\n\nYou're playing residencies in L.A. and Portland over a three-week span. What do you have planned for them?\n\nI've been doing it for an fair amount of time now. I still like to play music. I have a weird relationship with it at this point, where like the last long tour we did was last summer when we opened for Thrice. We left the tour in Edmonton to drive to play at Bonaroo, which is like a 38-hour drive or something like that, and we had two days to do it. I'm f---ing weird because I really like that. I like the insanity of parts of it, these bits of endurance that don't sound like fun but you end up having these really amazing conversations at 5 in the morning because you're wide awake and passing through some landscape that you've never passed through before, or stopping as the sun rises somewhere in Montana and going to some weird lake in Arkansas after you've been in a van for 22 hours.\n\nAnd a residency that's just like ... cake. The coolest thing about doing a residency is that you can do something totally different every night. That's one of the things I'm most excited about about these shows. The first night I'm playing semi-acoustic with Holly Miranda, who I used to do a lot of shows with. Jealous Girlfriends, I haven't seen or played with in a long time, we're doing some of each other's songs. I'm playing the whole new record with Morgan [Kibby] from White Sea and M83. Stuff like that you can do in a residency because you have time to rehearse, you have time to make each show stand alone and be this special thing.\n\nThe second week I'm going to play with a full band of people I don't usually play with ever, and do a collection of songs from across the catalog. The last week I'm going to have some guests I'm not going to announce yet. But the oppourtunity to get to express your music in three completely different ways over the course of three weeks and have them kind of feel \"lived in,\" have these special occurences that are only gonna happen one time is really rare, really something you don't get to do."}

{"text":"Taking a Psychadelic Journey with Centipede\n\nAnimal Collective's highly anticipated eighth album, Centipede Hz, explodes through the eardrums of indie music lovers with tracks pulsating with electronic bliss and catchy melodies. Full of the Baltimore-based band's signature weirdness and fun sound, Centipede is a breath of fresh air in the current music scene. Every track's energy is contagious, driving its neo-funk, psychedelic-folk sound. It's an album to keep handy while choreographing an interpretive dance.\n\n\"Moonjock\" begins the album's futuristic escapade with pounding beats and motivational harmonies characteristic of Animal Collective, are a bit hard to follow. At first listen, you aren't sure where the track is going, but its melody carries the band to a climax of intergalactic sound.\n\nThe second track, \"Today's Supernatural,\" is screechy, and at points there are so many sounds that you feel like your eardrums might explode. However, the track does come together, and Panda Bear, the band's lead singer, somehow makes sense of the cacophony. \"Rosie Oh\" and \"Applesauce\" are playful tracks full of Animal Collective quirkiness. Is that a frog croaking? I hope so.\n\nThe fifth track, \"Wide Eyed\" is a bit dry but serves its purpose as mid-album filler. Its composition may not be as impressive as the rest of the album, but a closer listen to the lyrics evokes feelings of self-doubt and insecurity. Venturing through Centipede is like bouncing from arcade game to arcade game with endless amounts of tokens. The track \"Pulleys\" is an adventure all on its own \u2013 it has an intensity that pulsates through hardcore beats and gyrating vocals.\n\n\"Amanita\" finishes up the album with pounding bass and lyrics like \"What have we done? Fantasy is falling down.\" The album ends with passion as the pace of \"Amanita\" builds and then suddenly comes to a halt, leaving the listener speechless and craving more. Each track throughout Centipede has a different feeling but the same amount of energy, melodic awesomeness, and berserk sound.\n\nAnimal Collective manages to stay fresh while maintaining a unique charm on Centipede Hz. This is an album I will definitely have on repeat, whether I'm partying or studying in Lau."}
{"text":"Word of the Day: Spoonerism. The definition? What Com Truise is to Tom Cruise, verbally.\n\nBefore I started listening to this brand spankin' new album from Com Truise, I looked at the ever-instrumental itunes genius recommendations, and I thought, oh, I like most of those people. Among them: Justice, Digitalism, Holy Ghost!, Chromatics, YACHT, blah blah, music that you probably like too, because it's good.\n\nAll of his summer tour dates are in Europe, with the exception of his stop in Chicago, where he will be playing North Coast Festival. If you've been to Europe recently, and you went to a festival or a dimly lit underground club\/dance floor with a cover, then that might give you an inkling of what this music is about before actually clicking that play button. And if you haven't done that rather obscure activity (this is more likely) then the music will give you an idea of what the European dimly lit underground dance floor is all about\u2026it works both ways.\n\nMy mom or yours might say, \"that just sounds like noise to me.\"\n\nSeth Haley hails from the electronic music hotbed of upstate New York, where he has been, as he says on his website, \"De-thawing in the Jersey sunshine, I compute mid-fi synth-wave, slower-motion funk.\" Is that not the most unnecessarily specific-sounding description of one's own creation that ever happened? Well, to put it simply, no, it's not. It is not only not overly specific, but it's right on.\n\nSide note: he is the second person I have ever heard (or read) use the phrase \"de-thaw.\"\n\nAs his description might indicate, Haley knows exactly what he is doing, or making. Only seconds after thinking how the aptly named opening track, \"Open\" is perfect videogame music, he there came a sample straight out of a video game. This music is the golden age of video game music, where you still got to pick in the settings page whether you wanted mono sound or stereo. Megaman would jam. And I, like Megaman, jammed.\n\nCom Truise brings disparate parts of the sound spectrum and jams them (like Megaman and I) together to make something where the synth waves and the percussion is spotty but there when it needs to be. Each segment of his production feels like a reaction to the last, and the amalgam is so harmoniously chaotic that those actions and reactions kind of make sense.\n\n\"Alfa Beach\" could have come from an 80s movie, with that electronic drum kit sound and the funky Jim Belushi-on-a-mission high synth high-synthing away, but then it breaks down into something jazzier, with a splashy cymbal. Then, like a reaction to the breakdown, Belushi is running again.\n\nYxes: It's \"sexy\" backwards. It confused me for a while, I kept trying to pronounce it in French, like Yves. The sample that goes SEXYYYY in the song pretty much gave it away.\n\nHaley is an artist for a very specific ilk, and if you are within than ilk, you will appreciate this music immensely. On the other hand, this is not pop. Com Truise is not a people pleaser, at least not in this day and age. It is playful but serious in a way that walks the line of nostalgic and envelope-pushing. Keep on de-thawing, Truise. I have some Megaman to play."}

{"text":"Floating Action's Seth Kauffman spills some 'Fake Blood'\n\nThe Shuffle clan converted to Seth Kauffman's music mere minutes after his 2007 solo LP Research landed in our mailboxes back in the day when music still took corporeal form. With its raw, outsider art-production values, and its musical echoes of Memphis, Trenchtown and Motown, there was a lot to recommend what Kauffman called \"lo-fi Carolina funk.\" The arrangements were loose and the riddims tight, and with Kauffman's creaky falsetto and just opaque-enough lyrics you knew immediately you were listening to the work of a true iconoclast.\n\nNow, as leader of Floating Action, Kauffman's turned out three full-lengths and captured the imaginations of some heavy hitters, including Band of Horses' Ben Bridwell (who helped name one Floating Action LP) and My Morning Jacket's Jim James. The latter's boutique label, Removador Recordings & Solutions, will team up with Asheville-based Harvest Records to release Kauffman's latest, FakeBlood (release date TBD), now that Kauffman has severed ties with Park the Van, his label home for the first two Floating Action LPs.\n\nKauffman's honored to have his peers believe in his music to that degree, but bristles at the unspoken \"musician's musician\" tag that comes with it. In fact, Fake Blood is, in part, a lament about a risk-averse industry that concentrates on flash-in-the-pan trends in the hopes of striking it big. It's also a Floating Action record through-and-through, done almost exclusively by Kauffman in his home studio. Shuffle Managing Editor John Schacht exchanged emails with Kauffman about the genesis of his new LP and some of its themes, his unique (and lonely) recording process, and what he's learned not to do after his years on Park the Van Records.\n\nShuffle: Fake Blood \u2014 didn't the last record, Desert Etiquette, have this title briefly? What's the story behind that?\n\nSeth Kauffman: Yes, I was like, 'Fake Blood is going to be the next album title' even before I made Desert Etiquette. I'd been using a lot of face paint, and even drew up the album art (which we didn't end up using) using red face paint. But none of the songs pre-date Desert Etiquette. That title came up, and I liked both of them equally. (Band of Horses frontman) Ben Bridwell ultimately made the call on using Desert Etiquette. Then for the new one, I started to ponder titles, and Scott McMicken from Dr. Dog would always say how he missed the Fake Blood title and that he wanted to use it if I wasn't going to (jokingly). So basically that title had to get used, and fits this album well.\n\nShuffle: What's the genesis of the title in any case? What kind of faux blood are we talking about here, anyway?\n\nSK: There's the Wayne Coyne side of fake blood, tapping into whatever that primal feeling is that it conjures when people see a bunch of blood, then using fake blood to easily get the same primal emotion. A lot of the subject matter in these songs has to do with my frustrations about making things that are pure and original (real blood), and no one seems to get it. Then there are a lot of Sleigh Bells type bands, where there's little soul and real content (fake blood), that blow up and a lot of people pay a lot of money to see them. So the title Fake Blood is kind of sarcastic, like a joke idea that it takes branding your legitimate art as non-legitimate gimmickry to get people to see it as legitimate.\n\nShuffle: Did you record this one similarly to the records you'd done in the past, where you did virtually all of it at home on your own? Or did you go to a studio, and if so, which one? Anything notably different about the recording this time? Is that a synth I hear on \"Ensnarement\"?\n\nSK: Yes, I recorded this one at home, it's just me on everything. Then I got Brian Landrum to add keys on a couple songs, and bolstered my own faux black woman background vocals using my friend, the great Maxine Gwynn, of Winston-Salem. \"Ensnarement\" is real strings, violin and bowed bass. That interlude was improvised on lap steel, with no meter, kind of leading the way, and everything kind of following it. It's funny, 'real strings\/fake strings confusion' has plagued me for years. I remember when Tom Petty's Wildflowers came out, I thought he used synth strings, but they were real. And every record I've made, I always actually take the time to play the damn instrument, and everybody thinks it's fake! Maybe we're uncovering all these secret hidden meanings to Fake Blood!\n\nI've always been a staunch supporter of capturing ideas right when they happen, on previous records; but I'd say on Fake Blood, that's notably different. Like a way stronger presence of that. Records are often boring to me when it took months and months in the studio, and everything has been smoothed out to perfection. I think there's a special magic that shines through, and is extremely exciting, the rare occurrences when someone actually hits 'record' for that first pure moment of a song being made up. Snatched out of the heavens. The fearlessness and vulnerability that you expose when you're stepping out on a limb and trying something that may not work. The track \"Not What I Came For,\" what you hear on the record is this actual MOMENT, it's the moment of creation, captured on tape, and it's wild and uncertain. In my mind at least. You can probably tell that I'm obsessed with it.\n\nShuffle: Are there any themes you touch on here that tie the songs together, either implicitly or directly?\n\nSK: Yes. Tons of themes. The thing that's great about a song is you can write one line that takes two seconds to say, yet if you actually explained it in normal language, you're looking at an eight-page dissertation. That's the mystery of it that I love, you can jump around and it doesn't have meaning on a surface level, but it clicks and explains all of life on this transcendental level.\n\nShuffle: Tell us something we don't know about a couple songs\u2026.\n\nSK: \"Matador\" does have a ribbon synth in it. The classic scenario of, it was just a weird off-the-cuff jam, no melody or words. But I found myself drawn to it, wanting to listen to it a lot \u2014 so I made the executive decision to manhandle it into a 'real' song. I'm a sucker for rhythms that push and pull so hard they're basically off.\n\n\"Harshness of the Blow\" is about a friend who was sexually abused as a child. Some of it's to the dude who dished out the abuse, and some of it's to the abusee. It explores the idea of the extreme amount of power you have, and that you can take away from someone else, and what an enormous, lasting effect it has on that person.\n\nShuffle: What about \"Seized?\" How often do you get seized?\n\nSK: \"Seized\" and \"Alpine Shadow\" are companion pieces. Part of the same thought. I get seized all the time, little moments, where the sublime beauty of life hits you, and for a second, you fully understand it. Flying down a trail on a mountain bike, and you glance up for a second, and see another mountain range across the valley, and it's in slow motion, you get seized, almost tear up.\n\nShuffle: \"Complete the Myth\" \u2014 what's the myth?\n\nSK: The music industry? The idea of how knowing too much can make you not be able to know. I know what needs to happen, and I know how it happens, but there's still some piece of the puzzle that you can't get, that you need to complete it. And you also know that if you didn't know about what you needed, it would probably come together. Being trapped by having an understanding of reality.\n\nShuffle: And \"Remorse Code\" \u2014 what's the most common trait in people's remorse codes?\n\nSK: That's kind of a companion piece to \"Complete the Myth.\" It's my life on the road, working hard, not taking musical and creative shortcuts even when you could probably be more successful by doing so. Standing by your art, and knowing that most success stories you hear are when people stood by their art. But I'm just confused at how to unscramble it and lay it out clearly. Like an undecipherable Morse code for expressing regret and frustration.\n\nShuffle: You've been at this now pretty hard for the last five or six years \u2014 how has your songwriting changed in that time, if it has? How does the positive feedback from your peers and critics help (in lieu of actual gold records!)?\n\nSK: I don't know if it's changed. Music is the best thing ever. Nothing gets me more pumped than creating something new and beautiful. I used to make up a song and be like 'this is what it is, this pure little guy just got pulled down out of the universe, so I don't give a fuck if anyone else hears it or likes it.' And now that there's some 'reputable giants in the rock world' that dig it \u2014 it doesn't really change my stance, just maybe gives a little more confidence to be bold, and also some kind of supportive dude camaraderie and hope \u2014 that while it's still a secret and you're never going to make any money, some part of the population is down with your vision.\n\nShuffle: You've had some personnel changes \u2013 Michael Libramento is playing with Grace Potter, and Mark Capon replaced him on bass, and Evan Martin, your old drummer, is back in the fold. How do they fit in with the Floating Action aesthetic?\n\nSK: I just try to capture this weird unique thing, this vibe that happens when I play all the instruments. It's not a control thing, it just is what it is. If we recorded albums as a band, it'd sound great, but it would just be something else. I'm not necessarily comfortable with that. I really just want to play in someone else's band. But something weird and unique happens when I do everything myself, so I'm just chasing that, like some uncharted route that might not even lead anywhere, but I have to follow it. Lately I've come to grips with that more; to just roll with it, not worry and speculate about other people maybe feeling bad, left out, whatever. Life is short, so just work your ass off and pump out as many jams as you can. Even if it means having to record at home, and never having or making any money.\n\nShuffle: Finally, how'd the Jim James label connection come about? What did you learn from your time on the Park the Van?\n\nSK: The guys from Dr. Dog were trying to help me come up with label ideas and solutions. They're buds with Jim, and suggested his tiny label Removador Recordings and Solutions. I sent him Desert Etiquette a lonnnnng time ago; never heard back for at least a year. Then he wrote back and loved it. He's really stoked on it, believes they're classic records, and (he's) bent on doing whatever he can to make the world aware of it, which is extremely above and beyond. He's dedicated, but also very busy. So with the help of Harvest Records, and me, we've kind of got this weird, grassroots team, trying get Floating Action to the masses in this pure honest way \u2013 it's kind of the anti-model of 'how you should do it' in the music industry. It's hilarious. It's really cool, and really exciting. We're like explorers, blindly charging forward with only the goal of getting something we believe in out there. Kind of continues the themes of the songs on Fake Blood. Should be interesting.\n\nWhat did I learn from PTV? Don't believe anybody, and don't wait to put records out. My experiences have culminated in our aforementioned 'anti-model.' I really don't have anything negative to say about PTV, they believed in me and took measures to help me out. But it seems like every success story, every band that blows up, is always in some unique way. I think most labels and bands try to borrow a page from those playbooks of what has already worked. In some ways that makes sense. But, if anything, we should be realizing that we don't know what's going to work; that there's no set way to make a band blow up. We have no idea what people are going to latch onto or why. Sometimes quality wins, and sometimes it doesn't.\n\nAlso \u2014 don't promise people money and other things you don't have or can't deliver. We got sent out on a lot of death-missions. I've gotten wiser about death-missions. A poorly put-together tour that has no strategy, where I end up losing A LOT of money \u2014 which is fine, if it's smart and bolsters the bigger picture. But if it doesn't, it can actually be worse to do it. The promise of some well-paying gig on the other side of the country that would financially justify the whole tour, only to find out the gig was just kind of a big 'maybe' that never really existed? Not good.\n\nLabels and booking agents will often run you into the ground without even a second thought. I'm so dedicated to the cause, I'm gullible and will travel anywhere for negative money. But I've learned to step back and recognize when that has no benefit and you shouldn't do it.\n\nI was lucky enough to travel with Floating Action across the country as their \"manager\" selling merch and occasionally driving the van\u2026 I just wanted to say, and I'll keep things brief because I'm going to play tennis with my girlfriend (who I met on tour with F.A.), that in our short amount of time together, I learned so much from Seth. He is a tremendously talented musician and a genuinely kind human being. His music alone is frapping impressive, but when mixed with those lyrics, it's another ball game. No wonder he's getting praised by the guys from Dr. Dog, Jim James, and all folks who are still making music. He deserves it. You can tell the guy actually has interesting thoughts going on up in his head. I always love reading his interviews\u2026. Somehow, he comes off as sounding like a wise man, maybe Gandhi or Tolstoy, mixed with Andre 3000. In other words, (if I had not yet made it clear), I think he's a badass and I wish for him the best. I greatly enjoyed the article (thanks shuffle)\u2026 Please let me know when Fake Blood comes out so I can pick up my copy."}
{"text":"Santogold: L.E.S. Artistes\n\nNov 30, -0001 \/ \/ 23 Views\n\nIt is a very difficult task to attempt to condense what exactly Santogold's music sounds like in a two paragraph synopsis. If pressed one would say she's part Karen O, part Debbie Harry part M.I.A. But that would be far too simple a conclusion not to mention far too safe, and would be ignoring the unique sound she brings to a stale pop landscape as of late. What's not in contention here is that Santogold was obviously influenced by Dub music, 80s Electronic, Indie Rock, New Wave and Punk. However, these past influences do not sonically make the music feel outdated. In fact her soaring catchy choruses and her firm grasp on solid song writing seems to be spearheading a new musical trend that combines pop melody with indie sensibilities. Santogold's newly released self titled first album is gaining momentum with critics and listeners alike.\n\nSantogold's first single \"Creator\" released in late 2007 was almost a shock to the senses. Listeners either loved or hated the electronic dub hybrid. The impact was immediate as the tune was featured in several commercials and fans began to pick sides. However, it wasn't until the young songwriter released her second single \"L.E.S. Artistes\" that the public got to see exactly what she had in store. The song is a scathing attack against pretentious NY hipsters and poseurs who inhabit every nook and cranny of downtown. Musically the track is driven by muted guitars that sounds like a cross between 80s pop rock and new millennium garage rock. The remainder of Santogold's album is just as hard to define and just as enjoyable."}

Nothing short of amazing--and you should expect nothing less--due to the twenty month recording process that took place.\n\nThe album does open weak, with \"Macroscopic,\" but uniquely, it's not due to it being a bad song, it's just not an exceptionally powerful start.\n\nBlacklist does pick up with \"Decompression,\" which introduces you to the intensity Jason Dodge can elevatw his vocals to. Lyrics like \"I get some\/some of the time\" are clever and also add to the excellent feel to the song.\n\nThrough the album the keyboards and drums astound you--the astonishing intro into \"Oil & Water\" use the keyboards to great effect. Todd Crayton's horns on \"I, Claudius\" are an amazing contribution to the song.\n\n\"Stalker,\" easily my favorite song on the album, show guitarist Jared Rushton strumming the power chords with Jason Dodge exercising the same intensity mentioned before.\n\nThe album has amazing lasting power--not only that, but it's so enticing to the ears, you will play again and again, and not get bored. It's that good, that intense.\n\nReview:\n\nDebuts are tricky things. New bands trying desperately to find their place in the musical world, to gain a larger audience and possibly even pick up a bigger record label. In many cases this makes a band's first CD jumbled and confusing, touching on a variety of different musical styles, trying to reach out to a variety of different listeners. Withdrawal's debut album, \"The Perfectionist Blacklist\", is guilty of this trait.\nRising out of Fullerton, California, the alternative quintet is certainly unique. Their songs all have impressive moments, little climaxes and melodies where the guitars swell and the symbols crash and a chill goes down the listener's spine. \"Oil and Water\" is a good example, it begins with a breath-taking guitar solo. Fast, driving, complex, it grabs the listener's attention. Added in is a fast repeated vocal line, that sounds more like another instrument than someone singing. The song fails to impress however, due to the length and the chorus vocals. The song dives into a slow, somber sonic mush that loses the attention that was gained earlier in the song. In addition, the chorus vocals are delivered in an annoying way, with a whiny fall off after every line. While this is emotion-filled and expressive to be sure, these vocal falloffs lose their effect when they are added to every line.\nThis is a consistent problem with the album, the band has just added too much. The majority of songs are over four minutes, and do not stay consistent in tempo, volume, or theme. Too much musical wealth has been forced into one song, and the result is a confusing, uninteresting mess. Withdrawal has potential, they just need to find their sound, and stick with it. Songs such as \"I, Claudius\" and \"Oct 23\" are worth listening to, but they could be so much better. Withdrawal is unique, has potential, and could be blockbusters if they trim back everything but what is truly necessary.\nRating: 9\/10"}
{"text":"Warpaint:The Fool\n\nIf CMJ's Music Marathon is still a way to detect trends, then it seems a big one this year is moody, reverb-heavy, female-led bands. While Warpaint's hypnotic slow burn puts them in the company of Zola Jesus, Tamaryn, Young Prisms and Lower Dens, The Fool scrapes the vocals clean of murk, leaving pristine harmonies to swirl through echoey synths, post-punk basslines and intricate guitars\u2014the collective sum being too delicate to venture into drone. As singer\/guitarist Emily Kokal (her low tones strike the earthiness of Cat Power's, her highs sound like Bjork, and her middle ground recalls a top-40 pop star) leads the atmospheric sprawl through shades of darkness and light, it sounds quite pretty, but ultimately Warpaint leaves something to be desired: melody."}
{"text":"Egypt Central won't be releasing their new album, 'White Rabbit,' until May 17. But Noisecreep has the exclusive early scoop, and we're thrilled to premiere the title track from the album. It's a crunchy, radio-friendly rager that makes lyrical references to 'Alice in Wonderland.' It's an anthem frontloaded with driving rhythms, razor-sharp vocals and a melody that just won't quit. You can listen to 'White Rabbit' only once, and it will continue to come back and haunt you.\n\n\"The song 'White Rabbit' is all the bottled-up angst of years of a bad relationship finally spilling out,\" the band told Noisecreep. \"This person had burrowed their way into lives and was trying to eat us from the inside out. We wouldn't let it happen and triumphantly moved on from that relationship. The song is a reflection of that journey but has grown to be so much more.\"\n\nListen to 'White Rabbit'\n\nThe Memphis-based band -- who borrow their name from one of the toughest roads running through their hometown -- also view the song as a rallying cry of sorts, saying, \"The 'White Rabbit' serves as a metaphor for anyone or anything trying to get in the way of our dreams. We won't be pushed aside. We will be heard.\""}

{"text":"Born and raised in Tennessee, Boxer Rebellion singer\/guitarist Nathan Nicholson didn't find musical success until he moved to England and joined up with his British and Aussie bandmates. The unsigned quartet found success with 2009's critically acclaimed 'Union' and an appearance in the rom-com 'Going the Distance.' This February, the band released 'The Cold Still,' a sleeker collection that shows how much they've come into their own. Spinner spoke with Nicholson about his Tennessee upbringing, his love for Oasis and his awkward run-in with Noel Gallagher.\n\nHow did growing up in Tennessee influence you musically?\n\nMaybe there's a better place to join a band. Growing up, I didn't know anybody in a band and in England, everyone knows someone in a band. I don't know if it's because it's smaller or there's a richer tradition of that kind of thing or what. In east Tennessee, there are not a lot of people that are trying to break out and write music. It's quite conservative. It's a great place to grow up, I had a great time, but I don't think it influenced me musically.\n\nI was more influenced by my parents' record collections or what I was hearing from England than I was by what was around me in Tennessee. It's the quintessential place where there's a rock station but they haven't added anything to the playlist since 1995: It's like Soundgarden and Nirvana and Pearl Jam and they'll throw in some Creedence every now and again. The music I was into in Tennessee has a much richer tradition in bluegrass and country music, which is excellent but it wasn't what I was into when I was 15.\n\nWhat kind of music did your parents listen to?\n\nThe Beach Boys and the Beatles and stuff like that, stuff with really good melodies. My dad's really into his blues as well, like Stevie Ray Vaughan. While that hasn't directly influenced me I guess it's inspired me because it's good music.\n\nWhen did you start playing music, and when did you feel like it was what you wanted to do with your life?\n\nI started really trying to play guitar and write when I was about 16 or 17. That's when I really started, my little pipe dream. Certainly when I moved over to England and Todd [Howe, guitarist] and I met, it was pretty soon after that that we really wanted to go for it and try to write music and somehow make a living out of it. It took us a long time but the desire was there.\n\nWere there any artists that imbued you with that passion for music?\n\nFor me, when I was 16, it was Oasis. Their first two albums especially were really big for me. Melodically, they were great. I got into their influences like the Stone Roses and Smiths and T. Rex and the Beatles and the Stones. It started from there.\n\nWhat's your favorite Oasis song?\n\nThe song that got me into them was 'Wonderwall' as it probably did for like 15 million other people. That was the first song I learned [on guitar].\n\nDo you have any musical heroes that you would love to meet?\n\nUsually, I would say no in the sense that I don't want to be disappointed by people. I've gotten to meet some cool people, but it was very quickly, like I met Robert Plant a few years ago and that was kind of cool.\n\nAfter our first album came out, I worked in a shoe shop for a couple of years when we were recording 'Union' and one night, some guy needed help. I had my back turned, I turned around and it was Noel Gallagher. I started helping him with his shoes and he wasn't very nice. Maybe that's just the way he is. That kind of shattered the dream a little for me.\n\nWas he being rude?\n\nWell, there was no one in the shop and he was walking around and I was just being stupid. Instead of saying something like \"We were signed by Alan McGee and you were signed by Alan McGee, isn't that cool?\" or \"I'm in a band\" or something like \"I like your music,\" I said \"Busy, isn't it?\" meaning the shop. He said, \"What, me?\" and I said, \"No, the shop,\" and he said, \"No, it isn't.\" That was the extent of our conversation. The man who got me inspired by music and I just said that [laughs]."}
{"text":"Interviews\n\nPoolside\n\nAccidental Splash\n\nIt seems appropriate that Poolside has sunshine on the brain. The Southern California-based duo (DJ Jeffrey Paradise and Filip Nikolic, formally of Junior Senior and Ima Robot) created their debut album Pacific Standard Time in the most regionally appropriate of settings: over drinks in their poolside studio, before literally stepping out the door to air cuts for a few friends. The result? A lackadaisical, lush blend of Balearic beats, shiny synths, and UV-baked posturing that they call \"daytime disco.\"\n\nUnder the Radar joined the duo at their Los Angeles studio space to discuss the art of defining one's musical identity, the joys and pains of releasing an album without a label, and the possibility of producing music in some very Shining-like conditions.\n\nLaura Studarus (Under the Radar): Has music always been an obsession for you?\n\nJeffrey Paradise: I had always been doing music since I was a kid. The idea of going to college, I was scared to do music, because you have to take it really seriously. I'm not very good with people telling me what to do. So I thought being ordered to play an instrument would just be unfun. I didn't know if I wanted my talent to be that I'm good at a particular instrument...I went to school for clothing design and textiles. Pretty much my last semester, I was like, \"I hate this. I'm never doing this as a job!\" Well, I didn't despise it, but the idea of it. It didn't translate, the actual craft, into a profession very easily. You either have to sell really generic stuff to the mainstream, or sell to rich people-both of which seemed not exciting.\n\nI guess that's how music is different. You can market to anyone.\n\nFilip Nikolic: I watched a cool documentary last night called PressPausePlay. It's about how the digital revolution has changed the whole music\/film\/art industry. Just pros and cons. It's super awesome. It proves that everything we did with this album is the right thing.\n\nHow did you handle releasing your album?\n\nJeffrey: Well we didn't give it away for free, but we had a lot of labels wanting to put it out. But it was going to be like nine months. \"You're going to have to owe us three records.\" Stuff like that.\n\nFilip: We just don't have the patience. We have so many friends who make music, and they have their album, and it takes them a year and a half to two years to put out. It's so slow nowadays! It's crazy because it should be a million times faster. But the record industry still goes in cycles of when you're allowed to put things out.\n\nJeffrey: There was one label where we said, \"OK, we'll take all your rules.\" Then at the last minute they changed their mind. We said, \"We need it out in three weeks.\" That was our thing. It has to come out in three weeks. It has to come out digitally.\n\nFilip: It came out a little late because we almost reconsidered and went with a label.\n\nJeffrey: We pushed back our deadline by two weeks for them. Then they were still pressing for more time. We were like, \"Forget it.\" Then, two days prior, they were like, \"OK, OK! Let's make the deal!\"\n\nFilip: By then we were stoked to not be working with them. It's so awesome to have full control.\n\nJeffrey: Complete autonomy. It's so cool.\n\nFilip: You can buy the album as a digital download on our web page for five bucks. But people still buy it on iTunes for $10! As soon as it came out it was widely available as an illegal download. But people are still buying it. I think if you approach all your stuff as being for the fans and create some kind of connection with people, people will want to support you. They don't want to support a big label.\n\nI think the industry is going to have to evolve to a more artist to fan transaction.\n\nJeffrey: We're happy to give people who like our music the album for five dollars. We're stoked to not have to add extra costs.\n\nFilip: I remember a couple years ago Radiohead let fans pay whatever the wanted. Everybody thought that was really cool and stuff. But if you're a new band, you're dependent on more stuff. We're lucky that we didn't consider this band our living. It was just a hobby. Every time we made money we just put it in an account. We had some cash to spend on this release. If you're a new band and you want to put out a record, it costs money. We were lucky to be able to do it that way. If we didn't have some cash up front, we would have had to go with a label.\n\nJeffrey: If we were 21 doing this, our first band, we would be locked down.\n\nFilip: Essentially a label is a really shitty bank. I've been thinking about it a lot. Even if you are a broke band, if you have somebody in your family who is eligible for a bank loan, the interest rate is way better and you keep control.\n\nJeffrey: It's like a bank loan, and then the band decides, \"You need to spend this much money on your house! And you have no real say on the matter, and you owe us that money back.\" When record labels controlled the whole distribution of everything, they could make all the rules they wanted. Now that they don't, none of those rules make any sense. It's an exciting time to do music.\n\nFilip: One thing that you get out of a good label is a strong brand attached to your name. That's important. A lot of people, if a label that they like puts out a new record, they're going to check it out. So it's not all bad when it comes to labels. But I think in our situation it's good because we're not ready to have pressure from a label either.\n\nBut how many people, like, say the average music fan, says, \"Oh I have to go pick up the new 4AD release?\"\n\nFilip: I know a lot of people who do that. Depending on the brands. I don't think people say, \"Oh, there's a new album out on Capital!\" [Laughs] But I think there's a bunch of brands nowadays that have a lifestyle connected to them. I think that attracts a lot of people as well.\n\nJeffrey: Like Kompakt. Awhile back I would buy anything on Kompakt, because I knew it would be good. And if it wasn't good, I would find a way to find something good about it.\n\nFilip: When you're young and scared to trust your own instincts in music, you want to listen to what the cool dude listens to in high school. Creating your own style is scary as fuck! You can't say, \"Oh I like Ace of Base, and I don't care what people think!\" That doesn't exist. But a lot of people secretly liked Ace of Base in high school.\n\nJeffrey: I did.\n\nI kind of feel like with the younger generation\u2014oh wow, I aged 10 years saying that\u2014but I feel like they can now. So much is available to them that high school kids 10 years ago didn't have.\n\nJeffrey: Kids these days when you ask what kind of music they like, their answer: \"Everything.\" That's the stock answer. Before, you defined your whole personality based on the kind of music that you like. And the kind of music that you hated.\n\nFilip: But when you're high school age, you don't do it based on your own instincts.\n\nJeffrey: No! Of course. Your mentors or whatever.\n\nFilip: You always had the guys that were a little older who you looked up to. They'll fucking tell you what to listen to and you'll get into it.\n\nJeffrey: I DJ at parties for kids who are like, 18. You ask them what they like, and they're all just like, \"Everything.\" Come on! Tell me who stands out, and they're like, \"Everything dude!\"\n\nIsn't that also code for nothing?\n\nFilip: Yeah, it's also bad. All of a sudden it's not music for the individual or something that you put time into. Music is something that's just present.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah, it's become functional.\n\nDo you both come from producing\/DJ backgrounds?\n\nJeffrey: I've made music with others in the studio. But Filip is the producer.\n\nSo you're more on the DJ side of it.\n\nJeffrey: I had been in a bunch of bands. I found DJing, and I was like, \"OK, I like this a lot.\" I want to spend time getting good at this. It felt like it employed the way I think about music. It was really cool to be able to make these sound collages. These tapestries. Or whatever. That's how I thought of music, so I took to it really fast.\n\nGoing into Poolside, did you come into it with a musician's mindset? Or did you approach it like a DJ?\n\nFilip: None of those!\n\nJeffrey: That's a good question. We started anti-DJ and evolved. We were like, \"Fuck DJs! We don't want this to be for the club.\"\n\nFilip: But we didn't want to play live either.\n\nJeffrey: We were just trying to make music we wanted to hear while chilling out.\n\nFilip: Not even. That came way later. It started out with us just getting drunk.\n\nJeffrey: Well yeah, that's how it started!\n\nFilip: It took awhile. Even when we got signed with our first song, we weren't taking it seriously. It wasn't supposed to be our serious project. We were just trying to hang out and swim. The first idea was, when there was interest and people wanted to put it out, that we could create this thing where we'd DJ and only play daytime pool parties.\n\nJeffrey: Never nightclubs.\n\nFilip: There was even an idea\u2014just to show how loose it was in the beginning\u2014our idea was to go to a DJ gig, and have pool chairs. Then we'd hire my roommate Dave to be the actual DJ, and we'd write down lists of songs. That would be our performance.\n\nDid you ever pull that off?\n\nJeffrey: No. All our early ideas we threw away. We started getting more serious offers and thought, \"Maybe we should rethink this!\" Originally we had no ambition to do anything with the project. But it kind of took on its own life.\n\nFilip: I think that's the best thing about music in this situation. We're not worried about what other people think. I've been doing music since I was a kid. In the beginning you always want to be cool. You want people to think that you're cool. People think it's good, of course. And then that tends to take over your mind, and you're worried about if people don't like it. At some point, after doing it for so many years, all of a sudden it's like, \"I don't really care.\" The process of making this music is a way shorter version than when you're doing something that has to become something.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah. Like, if you want this played on the radio, you've got to think this way.\n\nFilip: I think the most fun part of making a song is coming up with ideas and putting it together and making it into something. With the digital revolution, it makes it a million times worse. You can edit everything, you can get into details. You can overthink it. You can recall every mix; you can keep mixing the same song. And then you go crazy because you lost perspective. All my friends do that all the time!\n\nIt sounds like you're speaking from experience.\n\nFilip: I've never been because I get so annoyed. That's why this project is cool. It's like, \"This sounds like music!\" Boom! Out.\n\nSo you were drinking, you were mixing, you played it outside, it sounded good, and so you called it a day.\n\nJeffrey: Pretty much!\n\nFilip: We made the album incredibly fast. It's a problem these days. When you do music by recording into a computer, back in the days you were limited to a tape machine and a mixer. If your mix is not good, you have to start from scratch. All the settings are going to be different. You don't have the option of, \"I'm going to rest on this for a week, and then I'll come back.\" The thing that is really interesting to me is that you have to decide. It's done now. That takes courage. It's scary. You can always change something. The whole magical part of making a song happens pretty fast. And then you have this stage where you keep working, and you have to say, \"This is done.\" We got lucky. Our first song that got us signed, I wasn't supposed to sing on it. It was a demo. When this demo got picked up and this label wanted to sign us, first of all I was like, \"I'm not a singer. I've never sung in my life.\" It was a weird thing. Then we were also thinking, \"Do we need to finish this thing?\" It's called a demo. What does that even mean? If these people like it, why isn't it finished? So we've been following that principal since then. We want to skip the frustrating parts of making music.\n\nJeffrey: I feel like that's the part that people like about it. It isn't perfect; there is looseness to the songs. It's refreshing to a lot of people. It's not overproduced. That's rad.\n\nFilip: We've been talking about this for a long time. The flaw with computers is that you can make perfect songs, and perfect songs don't have personality. We need mistakes in music because humans make mistakes. We're not perfect. When music is perfect, there's nothing human about it. Stay away from overediting!\n\nYou're touring behind this. Are you playing it live or is it a DJ set?\n\nJeffrey: It's evolved. It started as DJs only. Then we were a two-piece band. Then we got a four-piece band with a percussionist and a keyboardist. Now it's a live band.\n\nOver time you're going to start looking like Edward Sharpe on stage.\n\nJeffrey: [Laughs] That's funny.\n\nFilip: We're not really against it. The thing is, we're considered electronic music, but it's not really. It's maybe 20 percent electronic, the rest is instruments. We're awkward about the fact that we don't have a guitar player. We have guitar on the backing track. It already feels weird. But if it were a purely electronic band it wouldn't feel weird. We have the urge to have that these real instruments in the backing track should be played, but we're also really cautious about not becoming a 10-piece right away. Touring is really expensive and we don't have tour support by default.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah, that's one of the problems of putting out your own record. If touring was cheap, we'd have a six-piece band with percussionists and guitarists and all that stuff. We can't put it into reality just yet.\n\nFilip: The weird thing is that it's not as weird anymore to have a small amount of people in one band. In some people's minds, us as a four-piece is like, whoa! It's a full-on band. It's cool, but I wish we were in the 1970s.\n\nJeffrey: Totally, three semi-trucks carrying gear.\n\nWith the rush to put out this album, are you two constantly producing new material?\n\nJeffrey: Not really. We wanted it to come out this summer. We've been planning on it coming out earlier, or even at the beginning of summer. Filip got majorly busy with other production projects. We were like, \"Fuck it, it has to come out this summer.\"\n\nFilip: Also if this were our big chance, we probably would have been a lot more careful. But this was like, \"Hey, we think it's done.\" Why would we wait? The normal thing is to wait, but this doesn't have to be like that anymore. When most of the sales are digital anyway, it takes a couple of days to set up a situation where you can sell digitally.\n\nJeffrey: For us, a lot of people liked us already, so who cares what's smart? These people want this album for the summer, and it's basically done. So let's give it to them.\n\nWell if your mission statement is about creating soundtracks to pool parties, what better time, right?\n\nFilip: That's the other thing. It was the fear of it coming out in the winter.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah, it had to come out this summer or next. Waiting a full year seemed ridiculous. It could have come out this October, which was the soonest it could come out, people were saying.\n\nThe only place people are still having pool parties in October is here in Los Angeles.\n\nFilip: [Laughs] Totally.\n\nGrowing up, did Los Angeles or Southern California carry with it a certain mystique?\n\nJeffrey: I think L.A. for both of us.\n\nFilip: Oh definitely! Coming from Denmark? The whole rap scene, the whole beach scene, all these things. Even Hollywood. It doesn't mean anything to me now, but it was this place, that you have ideas of how it is. It's a lot different, but still awesome. I hated L.A. when I finally got here the first five times I was here. I couldn't stand it! I was only on the Sunset Strip. That was the only place I knew about. We didn't know any people, so we had our management tell us, \"It would be good for you if you went to this party.\" It was all crazy networking situations!\n\nAt that point, did you decide to move here?\n\nFilip: Basically what happened was we toured with Ima Robot. I became really good friends with him.\n\nJeffrey: We met during Junior Senior.\n\nFilip: Yeah, about nine years ago.\n\nI imagine coming from San Francisco to L.A. wasn't quite as much of a culture shock.\n\nJeffrey: I have a lot of connections to L.A. But I love San Francisco, so I never thought that I would leave. But it's a very small city. You don't realize that. At a certain point you've done everything there is to do. So I moved to New York for a little bit and came here.\n\nSo given that you met years ago, when did you realize that you should work together?\n\nFilip: I guess we've always been doing it for fun when he's in town. We made some really stupid songs together.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah, some silly songs.\n\nFilip: It's never really been about the music, but somehow the music always happened.\n\nJeffrey: Yeah, there was never much planned, but we had always been jibbing around somehow.\n\nFilip: He just wanted to make music, so he came over. Him, me and Timmy [Anderson] from Ima Robot worked for a couple of days. It was just all these small tiny weird projects. Mostly as a basis to just hang out.\n\nIs Poolside your main project at this point?\n\nFilip: I guess it is, which is insane!\n\nJeffrey: It's kind of become that. We still both do other stuff. This is taking up a lot of time. It's almost like it has to be. We just finished a month tour. We've got a bunch more. But it's going so much better than I would have thought, and it's a lot more fun than I thought it would be.\n\nDo you have any idea how you're going to approach your next album?\n\nFilip: I was camping a couple of months ago in Big Sur. We thought about renting a house for two months and bringing all this stuff [gestures around the studio] and take it to the house. Big Sur is so beautiful but so useless. You can hike for days, but it's too cold to swim. It's this vast nature that's just present. It's an awesome feeling. Rent a house, and go on hikes in the daytime, and make an album from scratch in those two months. It has to be done by the time we drive home. We've even considered not having Internet and phones, which would be really weird.\n\nJeffrey: I'm pretty much for that. I think it would be really disorienting in an awesome way.\n\nI have a vision of the two of you reenacting The Shining.\n\nJeffrey: [Laughs] It could happen! I think it will be awesome though. Just be up there cooking, making music, hiking, just all things that we like doing without distractions.\n\nFilip: What if after day two we just hate each other?\n\nJeffrey: Hopefully we have enough life skills to not do that. You never know, I guess.\n\nFilip: One thing that's interesting with that project is that it's not summery out there. We'll probably be there in the winter. That could make the next album the complete opposite. I don't think we really care. It would be interesting for it to be the winter album.\n\nJeffrey: I'm into the idea. It would be so easy with the Poolside concept to regurgitate Pacific Standard Time Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4. It's rad to think that each album could be totally different from the last."}

Fix Me\n\nCatch my interview with Josh Head of Emery talking about the album here.\n\nMIKE HRANICA and CHRIS RUBEY of the Devil Wears Prada take AP track by track through their new album, Dead Throne.\n\n\"Dead Throne\"\nHranica: I love that \"Dead Throne\" ended up opening the record, because lyrically it really explains a lot of the questions about the title and everything. You'll know exactly what Dead Throne means when you hear the first song on the album. Song-wise, it's short; it's really easy to follow. It really never goes anywhere too far from the beginning. It sticks along the same track [of] just [being] pretty relentless and aggressive.\n\nRubey: \"Dead Throne\" was one of those songs that was written in demo form right around [the time of the Zombie EP], and it was intentionally written as the opener to the album. We knew we wanted to start with a fast, heavy song, and we were okay with having some shorter songs around two minutes, two-and-a-half minutes [in length]. It's the first song on the album that I do vocals on\u2014I just do some backing vocals, which is pretty cool. It is kind of hard to tell which ones are me and which ones are Mike, just because he does a lot of his yells [and] a lot of new vocal stuff on this album as well. I just do some backing yells\/scream type things.\n\n\"Untidaled\"\nHranica: \"Untidaled\" is kind of a bridge into the rest of the album. I wrote it a little bit differently than I've ever wrote anything else; [I wrote it] like a poem and then put it to the song rather than building off the song too much. \"Untidaled\" lyrically is one of my favorites. I feel like the way it breaks into the singing part later in the bridge\u2014it's very Prada-esque. The way we recorded vocals for the choruses was an interesting process, and I'm really glad how it sounds. \"Untidaled\" starts with the lyric \"back for the fourth time around.\" We were thinking about opening the record with it, but instead we did the second song, which still works as far as the fourth full-length.\n\nRubey: I think a lot of [band members] forget to mention [\"Untidaled\"] when they're saying what songs are their favorites, just because it sits as second on the album. I really like all the breakdowns with the bass where it drops out, the bass guitar and everything like that. The one singing part in it Adam [Dutkiewicz, producer] made a whole bunch better. That part used to be really different\u2014I think Adam actually took a few breakdowns out of the song just to keep everything flowing. The chorus has lots of fun guitar parts to play. That's one of my favorite songs on the album.\n\n\"Mammoth\"\nHranica: [Producer] Adam D. really took [\"Mammoth\"] and transformed it from a bunch of parts into a verse-chorus song. It opens with a really beefy part, but at the same time it has a very moving air about it, which we all really like. It feels like it goes from sounding like one band to sounding like another band\u2014and at the same time really being us, though, not a rip-off song by any means.\n\nRubey: \"Mammoth\" interestingly enough was the last song that was written for the album. Adam went through and he actually removed the main riff from the song that was in the demo version. He basically cut it up and was like, \"The song is going to start here.\" And where the song starts is a minute into the demo version. I love how it has a punky thrash feel to it the whole time. The middle section of the song where everything stops and Mike says, \"Pick it up,\" and goes back into it\u2014Adam says it makes him feel like he's playing Need For Speed or some racing videogame. I'm kind of pulling for it to be a single at some point.\n\n\"Vengeance\"\nRubey: As the main songwriter, I view [\"Vengeance\"] a lot differently than people who hear the song do. People that I've showed the CD to tend to say that \"Vengeance\" sticks out to them as a song that they really like. It's honestly one of my least favorites, just from a guitar standpoint, because the song is simple. \"Vengeance\" is actually a song that we wrote [as a] full band. Normally, I write a good majority of the songs on my computer sitting by myself. [But] we do some time-signature changes and some tempo changes in [this song] that I normally wouldn't have been able to come up with on a computer. The only reason that I'm not the biggest fan of \"Vengeance\" is because the song is composed of the same three root notes the entire song, but if you listen to it there's so many layers. Maybe that's why people think it's so catchy.\n\nHranica: I feel like anyone who hears [\"Vengeance\"] and knows that Jeremy McKinnon helped us out on the record would be able to tell that he definitely had a part in [the song]. The chorus is bouncy and very singy. Lyrically, it's something that McKinnon and I both collaborated on, basically an experience that we've both been through. It's just super funny that we actually did it, because it's something I would usually never really write about\u2014but it's something that Jeremy would always write about. It'll always be a memory getting to work with Jeremy like that.\n\n\"R.I.T.\"\nHranica: \"R.I.T.\" was a Jeremy McKinnon idea as well. When we were naming the song, he was like, \"Let me name it, let me name it.\" It's super cheesy, but \"Rest In Torment\" which is what \"R.I.T.\" stands for. The song itself is probably one of my favorites from the album. If someone said, \"Alright, pick the heaviest song from the album right now,\" I'd have to say \"R.I.T.\" Lyrically it means a lot, too; basically, the idea of the song is taking an angle of depression in the form of a female. It's definitely one of the darker songs.\n\nRubey: I'm assuming that people are going to think \"R.I.T.\" is closest to the Zombie EP. It's got the same aggressiveness and heaviness as the Zombie EP, but I wasn't trying to make it scary. The chorus has a really nice groove, the intro riff is just groovy and weird. It's all meant to be, I guess you could say Devil Wears Prada a little bit techier, but still understandable for our fanbase. If we went too math metal or technical, we would lose a lot of listeners, and I didn't want to [do that]. I do some backing vocals on that song. That's probably my favorite song, backing-vocal-wise. I think the only thing people won't like about it is that it doesn't have too many elements of melody in it. It's more of a shredder.\n\n\"My Questions\"\nHranica: Funny enough, when we wrote \"My Questions,\" I thought it was going to be the first single, my favorite song [and] the best first chorus song to put out. Honestly, it just ended up blending in with everything else. \"My Questions\" is definitely one of the more love\/lost songs definitively and intentionally. It brings back very powerful memories for me, and it has some of my favorite lines from the record.\n\nRubey: This one is more of a test of the melodic side of our band. The lyrics and the vocals, even though I didn't write them, tend to give me chills if you read along with the lyrics and you know what [Mike's] saying. It's a really emotionally driven song, since it's so melodically driven. It's got the longest bass slide the Devil Wears Prada has done, right smack dab in the middle of the song\u2014like, a two-measure-long bass slide in it. \"My Questions\" was actually one of my favorite songs before we recorded it, and then we made some changes that made it a little less this and a little more that, and I'm not sure if I like the album version more than I like the demo version. That's the only song [on Dead Throne] I feel that way about, from going from demo to album version, but I still like the way it came out.\n\n\"Kansas\"\nHranica: I am really proud of the song, and I really like the way it turned out. Everyone does a ballad song or an instrumental song to break up the record, and we did \"Louder Than Thunder\" on With Roots Above [And Branches Below]. \"Kansas\" sort of does that as far as breaking up the album, but at the same time, we hope it doesn't come off as, \"Okay, they're slowing it down, now they're going to pick it back up again.\" I had the idea to do an instrumental song, and I know we very well could write an instrumental record as fast as a vocal record if we wanted to, because we always write these jams and interludes during our sets between songs. Basically, that's what we did with \"Kansas.\" That song probably had the most effort go into it even though it doesn't have any vocals on it.\n\nRubey: \"Kansas\" was written full band. There's a sample that plays that's a voice speaking, and it's that portion of the song that I had written super, super long ago. Some of the riffs I took from songs that I was writing a long time ago for some solo project I had that never happened. It was kind of like Minus The Bear, Pelican-y influenced guitar-driven stuff, so that's why we decided to put those parts in an instrumental.\n\nWe intentionally wanted an instrumental, and when we were conceptualizing the whole album, the album definitely needed some breaks. You can't just give full-blown metal the entire time. We didn't want to give the fans something we made in GarageBand. It turned out to be a three-and-a-half minute track, so I think it's something that the fans haven't really heard from us. If we ever play that song live, I think Mike is going to play guitar on it because there's so many layers.\n\n\"Born To Lose\"\nHranica: I really like the way \"Kansas\" kicks into \"Born To Lose.\" The reason it is the first single was because we thought it was the song that was like the middle ground. Lyrically, it follows the no idols thing. It has a pretty non-extreme perspective at it.\n\nRubey: It's got a good groove, but it's not too different; it was a safe song for us to put out first. We didn't want to alienate any of our fans that like the sound that we have already. [But] it pushed what we've been doing a little bit already, and it lets people know what the new album is going to sound like as best as you can from one song.\n\nAdam took some breakdowns out of it. A lot of what he took out of Dead Throne was where we would change tempos for a specific breakdown and then we'd have to do some weird tempo change back up. A lot of bands will just do that and not think twice about it. There's such a thing as good songwriting that flows, and we try to adhere to those basic guidelines. Adam made sure of that. There's a part in the middle of the song where all the guitars cut out, and it's basically a breakdown with no guitar. The only reason that even happened was because before the song was even recorded, he muted the guitars there and was like, \"This keyboard part is so cool that I don't even want the guitars to be here.\" There's no way we would've written a breakdown with no guitars, but working with Adam in that scenario, that's how a lot of the parts that are considered creative came about on the album.\n\n\"Forever Decay\"\nRubey: We wrote that one, like, \"Alright, guys, we need a metal song. Let's make a super-metal song.\" It's kind of a sleeping giant, you could say. When I listen to it, it definitely pulls out a lot of emotions in me. I would describe it as a very aggressive song, a very in-your-face and emotional [song with] lots of rewind-worthy moments. \"Forever Decay\" and \"Vengeance\" are two of the only songs that we have in the tuning of drop C.\n\nHranica: \"Forever Decay\" is very love\/loss theme. It's super-dramatic\u2014I'm not afraid to admit that, but I like it. There's a part, it's the second pre-chorus of the song, that's this big, driving progression with this lyric: \"She fell in love with the city line.\" It's super emotional, and it just drives. That's definitely my favorite part of the song. When we finished the song all I could really think was, \"Wow, this is so old Prada.\"\n\n\"Chicago\"\nHranica: I love that song. We wrote \"Kansas\" when we wrote the first half of the album in Lawrence, Kansas, and we wrote \"Chicago\" when we wrote the second half in Chicago. I'm excited, because I like a lot of post-hardcore bands and that's kind of what Chicago is for Prada. It's the love\/loss theme. It's always going to hit me in a very particular place emotionally. It's something very memorable to me and reminds me of a specific time in my life. When we did \"Louder Than Thunder,\" it had a much bigger reaction than we thought. People would like us to do the same thing again, but we're not a band that does exactly what is going to sell. We do exactly what we want, and \"Chicago\" is exactly what we wanted to do.\n\nRubey: Whenever we get into band practice, we don't sit down and jam metal, we sit down and turn on our delay pedals and put on the clean channel. \"Chicago\" was a song that was all of us sitting there. We played it exactly like that on the first take, and then we were like, \"Go back and do exactly what you did again. Just try to refine your parts and remember what you did.\" Mike put his vocals on it and made it into what it is. It kind of defines a new sound that we possibly could explore in the future. I really like that song.\n\n\"Constance\"\nRubey: \"Constance\" was written along with all the songs on Zombie EP, and we didn't use it because we were like, \"This one is good, we have to use it for the fourth full-length.\" We toy around with playing major notes over minor notes in the chorus, and I really like the feel that gives to the chorus and the melody. That's the song that has our guest vocals from Tim [Lambesis] from As I Lay Dying.\n\nHranica: \"Constance\" turned out to be one of my favorites, but the other guys hear the song and they're like, \"Eh, it's not the greatest.\" The song is about insomnia and not being able to sleep. I think if I were to ever go to hell, it would be not being able to sleep. To me, that sounds like the absolute worst thing ever. So \"Constance\" is about sleep. When we wrote the song, it was always called \"The Egyptian Song\" because the pre-chorus is this octave part that is just super winding. There's a riff in the middle that's hands-down my favorite riff of the album; it's just the most insane thing ever. That's one of my favorite parts of the song.\n\nMy other favorite part of the song is the guest vocalist at the end. I got ahold of [Tim Lambesis] to ask if he wanted to do the album. He said yes, and I sent him over the parts. He was adopting a child from Ethiopia, so he comes back to me and he's like, \"I'm super busy with this, but [if] we have some time\u2026\" [The] whole time I kept telling him, \"Don't feel like I'm trying to obligate you into doing the record. I know you're busy, and obviously your new child is much more important.\" I was down in Ohio visiting and listening to it and taking notes, and the part comes on in \"Constance\"\u2014and he was on it. I wasn't expecting it at all. The way I describe it to everyone is that it's blatantly evil, which is funny for the people that know who he is and what he stands for.\n\n\"Pretenders\"\nHranica: Lyrically, the song is bitter. It's aimed at bands I don't like, bands that are super unoriginal and have no substance, [and] people that jump on trends\u2014which is why it's called \"Pretenders.\" All the songs have a very personal identity, which is why I've been able to rant about them for so long, but \"Pretenders\" has a very specific identity to me personally as far as having ideas. It definitely has that power and strength behind it. It's also one of Jeremy's favorite songs.\n\nRubey: I play \"Pretenders\" on a seven-string guitar. We kind of went through and picked the heaviest [songs] and said, \"These ones are going to be the heaviest ones, let's tune them the lowest.\" \"Pretenders\" is just supposed to be the heavy song. It has a slower vibe to it, a more chill vibe, but it's definitely supposed to be super, super, super heavy. I would say it's our breakdowniest song, our moshiest song. I rarely hear people say [it's] their favorite [track], but it's definitely one of mine.\n\n\"Holdfast\"\nHranica: When Chris wrote \"Holdfast,\" he actually had it called \"Radio,\" because it was a song that he wrote similar to when we covered [Big Tymers'] \"Still Fly\" as far as a very understandable verse-chorus-type structure. I love its purpose in the album. Lyrically, it's the most positive song. I thought it was cool to end the record with optimism, which is weird, because in retrospect I've always thought you end the record super heavy and super angry and leave people on that bitter note. To me, Dead Throne is very depressing. The end of the song is cool as far as just absolute vocal chaos.\n\nRubey: That one truthfully was written right after Branches came out, and we were like, \"Well, let's write a song that if it ever was to be our radio song, would be our radio song.\" \"Still Fly\" on that Pop Goes Crunk [compilation], that's still our number one song on iTunes, and I was just asking myself what makes people like songs like this. Because to me it's just kind of repetitive; I broke down the song structure and it's just chorus, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, verse\u2026\n\nSo I used the same structure as \"Still Fly\" but tried to write a way better, more metal song. I was telling myself when I was coming up with the riffs and everything, \"Write harder Killswitch, more metal Killswitch.\" I think it's the most different song. It doesn't necessarily sit with the rest of the album. I think it's the most With Roots Above-esque song on the album, but I think there [will be] a lot of people that are going to desire that, so that song is for them.\n\nThis is another reason to jump on the Spotify bandwagon if you haven't yet. Mark Hoppus did a track by track commentary for the new album Neighborhoods. Yep, hear his thoughts on the new record, but you have to have Spotify and if you don't have it by now\u2026.I just don't even want to be friends with you.\n\nAfter the VMA's I went to twitter and asked what was one thing you were surprised about with the VMA's. Most people's reaction was that the fact they still exist. I can see why the majority of people would say that, and let's be honest VMA's are practically a chance for major music pop\/rock stars to put on a show to congratulate themselves and peers to collect a shiny statue. Couple that with the fact that MTV hasn't played music videos in what 10 years? Well Bon Iver took to his blog to practically say what was on everyone else's mind. Summed up, the VMA's are pointless. However, that doesn't mean people won't watch them. As a matter of fact 12.4 million people tuned in to watch the VMA's. Justin Vernon you can rant my friend but I don't think things are going to change anytime soon \u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nAUGUST 30, 2011\nFOR TODAY SIGNS NEW ALBUM AND PUBLISHING DEAL WITH RAZOR & TIE\nNew Studio Album Slated For Release In 2012\nFor Today Confirmed On Fall\/Winter Tour With The Devil Wears Prada (Also Featuring Whitechapel and Enter Shikari)\n\n(New York, NY) \u2013 Razor & Tie is pleased to announce the addition of Christian metalcore juggernauts For Today to its expanding label and publishing rosters. The Sioux City, Iowa based band will hit the road this fall\/winter with The Devil Wears Prada, Whitechapel and Enter Shikari for a national U.S. tour. The band is already in the writing stages for its forthcoming new studio album which will be released in 2012.\n\n\"We can't even begin to explain how excited we are to join the Razor & Tie roster. The label has shown tremendous confidence in their ability to continue developing us as a band, and to build on the foundation we've set,\" said For Today lead singer Mattie Montgomery. \"Anyone who follows our band should know, this changes nothing about our commission or our passion. This means that, as we continue to proclaim the nearness of hope for the nations of the earth, from this point forward, we will do so with greater force, presence, and prominence than ever before.\"\n\nJohn Franck, Senior Vice President of Marketing for Razor & Tie comments, \"We're thrilled to welcome For Today to the R&T family. The band's incredible energy and positive message is a well needed breath of fresh air.\"\n\nFor Today formed in 2005 and has since released one EP and three full-length albums: Your Moment, Your Life, Your Times EP (Self-Released 2006), Ekklesia (Facedown Records, 2008), Portraits (Facedown Records, 2009), Breaker (Facedown Records, 2010). Having played over 1000 shows in five continents, For Today has toured with Emmure, We Came As Romans, Winds of Plague, The Devil Wears Prada. The band headlined the Scream The Prayer Tour 2010 with Maylene and The Sons of Disaster and also was on the Motel 6 Rock Yourself to Sleep Tour with We Came As Romans this past year. To date, For Today has sold over 65,000 albums in North America.\n\nThe hardcore-influenced metal band is known for their non-stop touring, high energy live performance, and unrelenting message. As forthcoming about their faith as they are about their musical prowess, For Today have become widely known as one of modern metal's most technically proficient bands. For Today is Mattie Montgomery (lead vocals), Ryan Leitru (lead guitar\/vocals), Brandon Leitru (bass), Michael Reynolds (rhythm guitar), and David Morrison (drums, percussion). The band is managed by Shawn Keith of Sumerian Entertainment and represented for touring by Matt Anderson of The Pantheon Agency.\n\nFor Today is the latest addition to independent label Razor & Tie's expanding rock roster that includes such artists as All That Remains, Norma Jean, Chelsea Grin, Attila, Saves The Day, and many more. The New York City-based label is one of the fastest growing independent record companies in the United States, and has garnered both Platinum sales and Grammy awards in its 20-year history.\n\nThe video, from the song, from the band that helped define a generation of alternative music. Nothing will compare to the RHCP. I liked the song when I first heard it but then saw the video and felt that it was fitting especially after reading the story behind the song.\n\n\"When I first heard ['Maggie'], I didn't know it would be a single. [But] I knew that I loved the jam,\" Kiedis explained. \"My first recording of that, I don't think it had many vocals on it. It was kind of mostly instrumental, about an hour long. Flea brought it in as a very specific exercise to write a classic bass line. He woke up, had his tea, sat down: 'I'm going to write a classic bass line. You can't stop me.' Played his bass line until he felt it was cooked into a classic, brought it to us and said, 'This is Classic Number One.' On a good day, you just know if there's music to wrestle with and get with, and it was one of those moments. I took it home and it felt so fun to listen to at length that I literally left it on in my driveway, opened the door and danced with the tree next to me for quite a while,\" he said. \"I had no idea that it would even be a song, I just thought, 'Oh, this is a great dance track. Let's put it on as a B-side, [an] hour long.' And then, as fate would have it, people heard it, and they were like, 'Oh, that's your best thing right there. That's your best thing.\"\n\nThe song inspired by an hour long bass track from Flea got me thinking. I don't really remember any interviews that Flea has done and it got me searching and then I found this vintage clip of him visiting Conan way back in the late 90\u2032s"}
{"text":"It's the Skeletonwitching hour and there's a new song from the total badasses with whom I was late in familiarizing myself. Not late as in today, but they'd already released two albums before I heard them. But, they rule. The new song is on Soundcloud (and below). The intro is really reminiscent of post-Liberate Zao. Chance Garnette's vocals have always had a Dan Weyandt feel to them, but this song really has a lot of Zaoish qualities. I'm fine with that because Zao fucking annihilates\u2026or, they used to. But, Skeletonwitch is on the upswing and the new album, if this song is a basis for judgment (which I'm pretty sure it should be)."}

{"text":"'ve never done it!\" he laughs. \"People seem to think I have because of everyone around me! The stuff that I do usually happens all at the same time so the percussion is built into the guitar part while you're playing everything else. It's more technically challenging in that it's much harder to get to the same point [than using a loop station] but it also gives you a lot more freedom further down the line because you can speed up and slow down and change things as you go along, which you can't when you're looping. But yeah, I've never done it. I felt like I'd missed the loop train when I saw KT Tunstall do it. I was like, 'She's nailed that!'. I was kind of doing my own thing by that point anyway. It's more of a playing style than an equipment usage thing with me.\"\n\nSo it's essentially a case of being too damn good for your own good?\n\n\"I guess so!\" he laughs. \" t sounds bad but I can make a lot of noise and people do get confused. There was one lady in particular who came up to me after a show and told me she thought that I was using backing tracks and I was like, 'Okay, just hang on two seconds', and I went and got a guitar and played one of the guitar parts from the gig, just right in front of her, not plugged in\u2026 and she went very quiet, looked a bit sheepish and said, 'Can I have a hug?' It's a weird thing in that it's not something that many people do. It's definitely never been a part of popular culture so people are still getting used to it as a style of music. I know people that are really into the songs and have no idea what I'm doing on guitar and actually don't really care! They just think it sounds nice. But for the hardcore guitar people, it's quite an extreme area.\"\n\nFaulkner has something of a personal relationship with his hand-crafted Nick Benjamin guitars, warmly noting that he's \"known them all since they were bits of wood\" and often lining a row of them up onstage at gigs, provding both a nice visual and quick access to different tunings. The live show played a huge part in the formation of Write It On Your Skin, with Faulkner keen to bridge the gap between the studio and his audience"}
{"text":"Summary:\nOften compared to Doves and Radiohead, Manchester-based Elbow is yet another new alternative band to emerge from the British music press hype machine. This debut album was shortlisted for 2001's Mercury Music Prize.\n\nAbsolutely beautiful album. Its filled with eerie and melancholy sounds mixed with some sweet riffs and effects. Definately worth a listen. Slow, moody, at times melancholy, but by no means boring.\u2026Collapse\n\nLow key debut that lays out the blueprint that Elbow went onto develop and expand on. It's got a very strong first half but I feel it tapers off a bit in the 2nd half. That said, the closer \"Scattered Black and Whites\" is one of the albums highlights. Overall, it's a soft and gentle record with some really beautiful songs. Garveys vocals are perfect for the delicate instrumentation and like the records the produced afterwards, it's a record that just makes you feel warm inside.\u2026Expand"}

{"text":"Gregory Alan Isakov Sings the Plains | Q&A\n\n[Editor's note: This Q&A previews Gregory Alan Isakov's concert with Classes and Gerardo Meza on Saturday at the Bourbon Theatre. Show starts at 9 p.m., and cover is $8 advance, $10 day of show.]\n\nby Michael Todd\n\nFor years, Gregory Alan Isakov lived on a farm outside of Lyons, Colo. He'd look out his window and wouldn't see anything but a cow pasture. It's an empty vastness that we Nebraskans know all too well, and it's a void Isakov helps to fill with his full-bodied folk songs.\n\nThis college-educated horticulturist's songs are something like good-natured farmers themselves, with weathered faces of their own, calloused fingers and a collection of off-to-the-skies looks. Isakov sounds comfortable using both his should-be-a-good-friend voice and a more distant, radio-broadcast tone. Considering his background \u2014 and that his latest album is called The Empty Northern Hemisphere \u2014 it seems almost fitting that every other word is lost to bad reception at the start of our phone interview.\n\nAs he and the band drive through Illinois on their way to St. Louis, we hang up and wait for the bars to show up. Isakov pulls off the road where he finds an oasis in the emptiness, and he answers a few questions about his friend in Sargent, Neb., who gave him his favorite guitar, about watching his garden grow while on tour and where his songs come from. See Isakov in concert Saturday at the Bourbon Theatre with Classes and Gerardo Meza.\n\nHear Nebraska: Tell me about your favorite instrument, what is its story?\n\nGregory Alan Isakov: I have a lot of favorites, but I have a Gibson I play a lot from 1967. My friend brought it to Vietnam and back and later gave it to me. I also have this $75 Silvertone I found and never had a case for it. I've been writing on it a little lately, but yeah, the Gibson is my standby.\n\nHN: Do you like guitars with a story, with character?\n\nGAI: I do. A lot of older guitars just sound so much better, and a lot of the time they do have a history. I've never liked the sound of new guitars for some reason.\n\nHN: I've read that you wrote the album That Sea, The Gambler while driving in a truck to and from work on a farm. Tell me how that worked; did you record yourself singing while driving, or did you remember everything?\n\nGAI: I never recorded it. I'd pull over a lot to scribble stuff down every so often. It was about a four- or five-song drive, where I'd just go through those songs in my head and work them out. Most of the songs happened that way.\n\nWhere was the farm?\n\nGAI: It's just outside of Lyons, Colo.\n\nHN: From your website to some of the clothes you wear, it seems you like an older aesthetic rooted in simpler times. A good number of artists today also seem to be pining for an era past. Why do you think that is?\n\nGAI: I don't know. I'm not sure. I do like to help out with the people who do our artwork and website. But yeah, I don't know where that comes from.\n\nHN: You say that you don't know where your songs come from. As you come to know them through recording and live performance, is it like getting to know a person?\n\nGAI: Yeah, I feel like I never really know where they come from, but I feel like when they're finished, they're finished. I'm in a different place from where the song starts. It's like a ride or an adventure. Hopefully, you kind of end up in a different place.\n\nI write a lot of words and a lot doesn't make it into a song. Some of it does, though. And I heard someone say once that you walk around eating up poetry and one day you just throw up a song. It's a lot like that (laughs).\n\nYou have all these experiences, and some of them come out in songs. And some of the songs, I throw away right after I finish them. I never know which ones are the ones that last.\n\nHN: I'd say you have a better idea of the openness of this region than most touring artists. Is there something about the relative emptiness that influences the music written in states like Colorado and Nebraska?\n\nGAI: I do. It does make it into the music. I write a lot on the road. It's funny the first time I went to California, I had my first record out. I felt funny when I was playing among palm trees. I remember waking up in the place I was staying, and I just felt funny. I remember that being weird. I think that where we are makes in the songs, though.\n\nHN: As a Coloradan, what do you think of your neighbor Nebraska?\n\nGAI: I love Nebraska. My good friend is a rancher up there in Sargent, he's a great songwriter and the same guy who gave me my Gibson. I've driven through there a lot, it feels like home. His name's Bruce Cofler, and I just produced his record: a lot of war songs, cow songs, but really good.\n\nHN: Since you went to college for horticulture, I'm wondering if you have friends tend to your garden while you're on tour, or do you wait to plant till you get back home?\n\nGAI: My neighbor is sending me pictures of it. We've had a super nice spring this year. We didn't have the normal frost that we do (laughs). You probably know just as well as I do about that.\n\nWe were just talking about trying to time our trip to get back when it's not dark. Let's try to get there during the day to see how everything's doing.\n\nHN: I have a question about \"Dandelion Wine,\" a metaphor in that song, but first I just want to know what dandelion wine is.\n\nGAI: We used to make it out on the farm. It's really good; it's fermented, and you take the dandelions and make like a honey wine. It has that quality of a certain place, which kind of came out in that song. People relate to that song because Ray Bradbury wrote a book called Dandelion Wine, but I've never read that actually.\n\nHN: You describe the summer in \"Dandelion Wine\" and a certain \"you\" in \"Big Black Car\" as magazines. Could you unpack those metaphors?\n\nGAI: The first one in \"Dandelion\" is kind of inspired by sitting in town, in Boulder in the summer. It clears out because everyone leaves town. It becomes quiet, and it feels like a lazy afternoon: the hot air, times going by slow. Then in \"Big Black Car\" it's talking about someone who's fancy and out of reach like a magazine.\n\nHN: All right, I guess that's about it for questions. Since we're a website focused on Nebraskan musicians, though, could you tell me a little more about your friend Bruce?\n\nGAI: Yeah, he just put out a record. My producer and myself produced it, and it's a great record. (Isakov asks his bandmates) What did Bruce call the record? I think we have it in the van (pause). It's called The Road Back Home.\n\nHN: Cool, thank you. That should be it then. Do you have anything else to add?\n\nGAI: Oh, just that we're excited to be back in Nebraska. We haven't played in Lincoln, so we're looking forward to that. The last time we played in Omaha, that was really fun. We've heard great things about Lincoln, so it should be a good time.\n\nMichael Todd is Hear Nebraska's managing editor.

What does this have to do with Stockholm, Sweden's Hanna Hirsch? Hanna Hirsch is bridled to a similar undeniable pop sensibility\u2014like a river of silver\u2014pulsing in the heartbeat of these undeniably contemporary punk songs. The recording sounds icy; shatteringly icy, like it was done in a vacuum, in space. It's that infinity that gives the entire record a stretched-out, palpable desperation. Bladerunner android vocals, stainless steel-sounding synthesizers, organic, thudding drums, and glistening, serrated, barbed-wire-of-the-future guitars crash and crunch together. Even when they slow down and get quiet, it's tense and pretty as all hell. Excellent. Well worth a long hunt.\n\u2013Todd Taylor (Diskret F\u00f6rlag"}
{"text":"According to interviews with The Johns, the resemblance of instrumental TMBG tune \"Minimum Wage\" to Frank Sinatra's \"Downtown\" is no accident. The swining tune kicks off with the exclamation of the title and dives straight into the big band feel. All that's missing is a decent Rat Pack.\n\nThe future holds hope for humanity. Some people think robots will become intelligent enough to overtake their organic masters, but fear not - They Might Be Giants has it all figured out. They've used the track \"Robot Parade\" on the kids album No! to help the small ones realize that, one day, they'll build a giant cyborg that they'll control with their angelic voices:\n\nOK, this one's actually for children. But how jealous we are that today's kids get to enjoy educational lessons disguised under the facade of top-notch rock n' roll. Just remember to remind them that \"West Xylophone\" is not a real country.\n\nJohn Flansburgh touts that he can hit any of the notes in their a capella gospel song \"O Do Not Forsake Me,\" but instead, TMBG subbed German harmonists Hudson Shad to take the reigns. It's very much a They Might Be Giants number, funneled through the commanding bass vocals of a couple of Deutschens.\n\nTim Burton and They Might Be Giants have something in common: the innate ability to turn the macabre into enjoyable piece of pop art. \"Dead\" is about just that - a funeral procession and not living up to life's expectations. It would be a tough concept to swallow, if the song weren't so damn snappy:\n\n\"Boat of Car\" might be the Andy Warhol of the They Might Be Giants collection. The song lifts Johnny Cash's haunting titular line from the song \"Daddy'll Sing Bass\" and continues to creep us out with the suggestion of following the \"traces of your fingernails that run along the windows...\"\n\nNo, the song doesn't have any connection to Nancy Willard's children's book, but we're sure if you read the book and listened to the track at the same time, you'd have some sort of eye-opening experience.\n\n\"Nightgown of the Sullen Moon\" isn't a drug trip, nor necessarily a space walk, but it will take you to the moon. How many songs can promise that trip?\n\nThey Might Be Giants' Mink Car took a severe 90 degree turn when it was released in 2001. The album toys with electronica, processing and a experimental techniques - and it works. \"Cyclops Rock\" turns up the amp and puts the emphasis on \"rock.\" It's loud, it's energetic and it makes references to Child's Play."}
{"text":"April 2011\n\n20 posts\n\nYellow Bird\n\nThis mix is by Tiffany and is about teacups and lost love, seemingly.\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: Since I didn't post anything yesterday \u2014 I gotta take some days off, you guys \u2014 here's a two-parter for you. \"We were two kids acting tough, then we grew up \/ Well, me not so much\" pretty much sums up this blog's arrested development and the mix highlights some of my favorite artists from high school and college. (\"My Girlfriend's Boyfriend\" by Her Space Holiday remains one of my favorite songs of all time.) But what I really like is the flow: pretty delicate with a few yearning bursts of energy here and there. Good for welcoming wandering thoughts about lost loves\u2026 when you should be writing a paper.\n\nThis mix is by dearoldcharm and is about how I wish I was a little bit taller. Additionally, a baller.\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: I usually like to stream mixtapes before I download them, but a quick perusal of the tracklist made me download this immediately. You guys. Every song that it was inappropriate for me to love in the 90s is on this mix. It brings up strange memories. Listening to \"Can I Get A\" while sitting in the back of my aunt's car, driving away from Mass. Hearing \"No Diggity\" in my 675th viewing of Dunston Check's In. Pretending I didn't just sing \"go go Jason waterfalls\" to my uncle. Staying in the cafeteria for an extra three minutes and 34 seconds so I could define a scrub and inform the masses why I would prefer to do without one via song. Wait what?\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: I don't know if you've heard, but Moovers and Shakers reached its goal on Kickstarter. To celebrate the fact that I'll soon be driving around Nashville selling milkshakes via truck, I'm posting an hour of happy, bouncy, dance-y, twirly POP. It's all about the moments: the can-can line breakdown in \"Come on Eileen,\" the surprise solo at the end of \"The One You Want,\" the handclaps and the lovestruck sincerity in \"Always On My Mind.\" This is the happiest mix I've ever made, and only a fraction of how I feel right now.\n\nSide note: If you're interested in winning my love, just tape \"The Idea of Growing Old\" followed by \"The Promise\" for me. I WILL LITERALLY FALL INTO YOUR ARMS.\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: As you can tell, none of my mixes in high school were allowed to have short names. (This is probably because I listened to a smidge too much Fall Out Boy, Panic! At the Disco, and of Montreal\u2014 aha! One of those is not like the other.) So the real title of this mix is Reinvent Love: Melodramas of Colored, Speckled Eggs. Obviously it's about Christ rising and vanquishing sin from the world. JOKE. It's basically about rabbits and candy. Happy Easter everyone!\n\nThis mix is by quarterwhipped and is about David Bowie. JOKE. It's about people who like David Bowie.\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: My dear friend Sarah pointed this mix out to me the other day and I promised I would post it today\u2026 and then I forgot until right now. This is extremely shameful, on account of, DAVID BOWIE. You guys. David Bowie is my idol. You know who else is my idol? Morrissey, obviously\u2014 and he's featured here doing a cover of \"Drive-In Saturday.\" Vivian Girls, Mates of State, M. Ward, and Au Revoir Simone also make the cut. Unfortunately, Big Surr did not, even though they have one of the best Bowie melodies ever. For shame!\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: There are two things I loved in school: zombies and convoluted apocalyptic theories. (Okay, also, X-Men.) So I think it's fair to say that this mix is my jam. Most of the mix comes from dark and rumble-y orchestral tunes off soundtracks from mind-bending movies, but there's also a track from Godspeed You Black Emperor! I never listened to Godspeed You Black Emperor! in high school, but I did like yelling their name while running and pouncing on people's backs.\n\nWhy it's Pretentious: Look, if you're gonna be pretentious, you better have a lot of alternate versions of songs lying around. You better collect unreleased Smiths demos and bootlegs. You better yell \"when you kiss me\u2014 I sing it back\" when you're listening to \"Sweetness\" by Jimmy Eat World and change the entire ending of \"Round Here\" by the Counting Crows during your weekly ironic karaoke. You better refer to \"Mathletics\" as \"Neu Funk Aum,\" a double whammy since Foals didn't even release either version on a full-length. Takin' things to the next level, you know? Anyway, this is a mix of songs that sound better than their actual releases. Respect\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: Because festivals are pretentious. And rock magazines are pretentious. And Spin Magazine is doubly pretentious. (Quadrupably? You betcha.) Mostly because Morgan Swank works there. And it features !!! and any band that's impossible to Google is definitely pretentious and misguided. But what I really like about this mix is the fact that it would have been really impressive when I was in high school, but now it's very \"PJ Harvey? Remember when she was on Gilmore Girls?\" HAGS, Spin Magazine, Don't Ever Change.\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: Sometimes I look back at mixes that I made for people and notice little subconscious things. Like, I probably should have known that including a song with the line \"What do you mean I don't love you? I am standing here, aren't I?\" on an anniversary tape meant the relationship was a little strained. (Or that when he didn't appreciate Klaxons covering Justin Timberlake, it was definitely not mean to be.) I don't listen to this mix much because that incidental foreshadowing is a bit strange to hear, but I do think it's a sweet little jumble of songs. Makes me smile.\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: Because I feel the need to obsessively catalog and track my interests (I've had the same last.fm account for six years), here is a mix of fifteen favorite songs from the first quarter of 2011. It features comeback tracks from the Kills, Architecture in Helsinki, and MSTRKRFT, as well as clever pop culture-referencing raps from future collaborators Das Racist and Childish Gambino. I know that all of this is pretty pretentious, because I'm a music journalist who trades having a real social life for spending too much time on the internet, thus living in a weird digital cavern of mp3s and arguments about microgenres. However, you should listen to this anyways; \"Love & Lust\" by Arveene & Misk is a great electro banger and Oberhofer is one of the best live acts I've seen so far this year. Also, I'm just going to confess now that I wish there was a mash-up of both songs called \"Hot Mess\" from Chromeo and Cobra Starship. Does that make me sound any less pretentious? No? Fine. Just go listen to all of Zonoscope by Cut Copy, because it is phenomenal.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Vaguely Radical Behavior (Side One: The Night Bleeds Into Day)\n\nThis mix is about the end of the world.\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: Since I've been posting a lot of middle school tapes lately, I thought I would overcompensate with another convoluted epic. This one has a ridiculously long title that I obviously stole from David Bowie and is based off Foals' \"Electric Bloom.\" Basically, this kid keeps having nightmares about the end of the world, so he tries to warn people, but no one listens to him. He's waiting and waiting for a sign to show people that his visions are real, but he just gets angrier and angrier until he snaps, goes on a rampage, and single-handedly destroys the world as we know it. Self-fulfilling apocalyptic prophecies, you guys!\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: I originally had a guest post from one of my friends planned, but it's getting late and I wanted to do it justice, Facebook-pimping-wise, so quick switch! I've been listening to a lot of 50s and 60s pop to get in the soda shop mood, and I stumbled upon this mix of cover songs of Sam Cooke, The Everly Brothers, Bo Diddley, and more stellar oldies-but-goodies. Definitely worth a spin on the ol' record player.\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: In middle school, I had a very long playlist called \"Theme Songs\" that features songs that were CLEARLY WRITTEN ABOUT ME YOU GUYS. Since it's from middle school, it a) doesn't follow the theme of this blog and b) is even more angsty and bad than usual. (Please note how it starts with a song that is slightly sad and then jumps straight to a song about how I'm so much more awesome than you.) Obviously \"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\" makes an appearance, but strangely, there's no Jenny Owen Youngs or Taking Back Sunday, which I find to be an incredibly inaccurate representation of middle school me.\n\nSide Note:Moovers and Shakers has their Kickstarter up! If you read this blog and you're like, wow, her taste is music is spectacular and I'd really love to help her dreams come true and maybe get one of her mixtapes mailed to me, THIS IS FOR YOU.\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: I once made Sarah a mix based on the dictionary word of the day: idioglossia, or the unintelligible, secret language between twins, or two people who are otherwise inseparable. This mix is based around the word lucifugous, which means shunning the light. It features music from Yeasayer, Bon Iver, and Blind Pilot, and is whatever the dark-version of stellar is.\n\nSide Note:Moovers and Shakers won a $2000 grant today! One step closer to getting this truck on the road."}
{"text":"Friendly Foes | Born Radical\n\nSongs get stuck in my head for two reasons. At best because they are good, inspiring songs that I can connect to on an out-of-body-experience level, and at worst because they are catchy songs. And even the worst reason isn't bad.\n\nWith its first full-length release, Born Radical, the band Friendly Foes brings the worst to the table \u2013and I mean that in the best way possible. Am I confusing you? Well, if your brain has trouble handling what I just said, then it will have no problem digesting the music.\n\nThe toe-tapping, finger-snapping tunes of this punk-infused power-pop band provides uplifting and fun music but with their simplistic lyrics and basic song structure it is evident the band threw the music through their speakers and into our ears. This album didn't require much work from the band and in turn, doesn't require any work for the listener. The songs aren't complicated, and they don't pretend to be; with their catchy but basic song structures, they pull off their intentions of just getting out there and writing some songs together well. Friendly Foes is having a blast and playing music without thinking too hard. With songs like \"Breakfast Burritos\" and \"Get Ripped,\" the band makes this fact obvious. In a time when bands are using off-beat and bizarre tactics to gain attention (see Of Montreal), Friendly Foes takes the opposite approach, and it seems to be paying off.\n\nSinger\/guitarist Ryan Allen took a break from post-punk rock band Thunderbirds Are Now!, picked up bassist Lizzie Wittman and drummer Brad Elliott, and just a little over a year later, Born Radical was born. The first song on the disc, \"Full Moon Morning\", tells a story of how they came together. \"Got an amp with some chords\/ try'na sing 'til my throat bled\/ start a band we were bored\/ not sure of what's ahead.\" The album goes along with a similar tone, and in my opinion the best song on the disc, \"Get Yr Shit Together\" (\"One day I'll get my shit together and if you don't, you'll blame it on the weather\"). There is not a lot of variety in terms of style on this album until you come to the sixth track, where Allen gives his bleeding vocal chords a break and Wittman takes the mic for \"Get Ripped.\"\n\nIf for nobody else, I recommend this band to those out there struggling through winter climates that are getting the best of them. So to all those SAD sufferers, get out your fluorescent lamps and \"pop\" in Born Radical. You'll be sure to brighten right up, jump out of bed and dance around to the radical, uplifting tunes that Friendly Foes provide"}
{"text":"Garage\/Indie: Butchercons consists of singer\/guitarist Neil and guitarist Jose Tolentino, alongside bassist Paolo Bernaldo and drummer Bobby Padilla. The band formed in mid 2009 thru the initiatives of Neil. After several line-up change, they went to the studio immediately to record several tracks. They've been going in and out of the studio, like rabid hounds, recording and re-recording tracks exploring and pushing their sound. Structures are topsy-turvy, often done intriguingly. It's punk and unafraid to pepper their tracks with grime, gore and guttural screams. It's a demolition derby played out on city streets at night. For all its righteous fury, the trade-off between texture and song writing balances beautifully. Sublime as they are surreal with a sound loaded with hazy nostalgia and a fiercely experimental pop palette.

{"text":"Anyone who approaches this album having heard the band's more recent work might initially be in for a surprise: it sounds ragged.\n\nIt's disconcerting to say the least and not entirely erased on repeat listens. 'A Shrug And A Fistful' feels a bit weak, 'The Wheel' goes on for about 6 minutes too long and 'On My Pillow' really is all over the place.\n\nHowever, after a few listens (which takes a while, bearing in mind the album is over an hour and a half long) it all (well, mostly) works. 'Kill Some Day', 'Beautiful Sister' and 'Now It's Time To Skate' provide CD1 with some VERY solid songs, but it's CD2 that caps it all. While, as mentioned, 'The Wheel' is far too long, it's still pretty good, but ends up being eclipsed by 'Sungravy' (which should not be played near any glaciers), 'Grindstone' (the heaviest song on the album) and 'The Golden Core' (simply awesome) which not only demonstrate the breadth of Motorpsycho's musical base, but how good they can be.\n\n5.0 out of 5 starsA classic, and finally available to les Anglo-Saxons25 Nov 2004\n\nBy Jonas Sebasti\u00e9n - Published on Amazon.com\n\nFormat:Audio CD\n\nMotorpsycho is by far the most inventive, respected and influential force in modern Norwegian music and \"Timothy's Monster\" won't leave the listener wondering why. Chronically impossible to box into a genre, and producing albums \"quicker than most people change their underwear\" (at least according to one of the band members), their ever-changing musical expression has gained them cult-status in Norway and the better part of Western Europe.\n\n\"Timothy's Monster\" is their '94 lo-fi adventure, and possibly the most radio-friendly and commercial of their classic 90s work (although its commercial potential and radio friendliness only exists in comparison with other parts of their discography). The album is part of what I would call the golden era of Motorpsycho - the time when the band in the course of a few years produced classics such as \"Timothy's Monster\", \"Blissard\", \"Angels and Daemons at Play\", \"Trust Us\" and - under the claim of making the soundtrack to an obscure German western movie they released \"Tussler\", a country-music adventure done by an extended Motorpsycho for the occasion named The International Tussler Society. (Originally released in a very limited edition, it was re-released last year and is now available to the broader audiences).\n\n\"Timothy's\" has often been described as the entry ticket to the wonderful world of Motorpsycho, a description that is quite accurate. The album is spread over two CDs, the first one consisting of 11 \"short\" tracks (in the world of Motorpsycho, anything less than 10 min. is considered short...). The form of the music indicates a break with the band's heavy metal past, drawing more from the band's love of Sonic Youth and Pixies, yet still managing to create a soundscape so original it is impossible to describe by the mere use of references. A light, fuzzy and noisy lo-fi sound mixed with melodies that are at times interrupted by noise-filled breaks, and at times repetitive in the Sonic Youth interpretation of the word, the album not only defined the sound of Trondheim, but has also been of invaluable importance to the city's music scene.\n\nStaying true to the term lo-fi, the first track, \"Feel\", is recorded in band member Bent's own living room, with four track equipment and questionable quality of sound. However, the rawness of the recording adds to the beauty of the melody and the simplicity of the arrangements, making it a gorgeous opening to an even better album. \"Kill Some Day\" is the closest one comes to a radio hit from this album, but with the exception of Norwegian radio's legendary \"Roxrevy\", it hardly made it to the broad masses. The two last tracks of the CD, \"Watersound\" and \"Giftland\", are longer, more repetitive and telling of what is to come once you switch CDs.\n\nThe second CD of the album at first appears as somewhat of a B-side. Four tracks, some of them very long, display a distinctly different and more heavy-inspired Motorpsycho from the one presented on CD one. But as the music of Motorpsycho is of the kind that tends to grow on you, you'll find that after a few listenings you're digging the 20-minute long \"The Wheel\" or any of the other tracks at a much more frequent basis than the 11 tracks of CD one.\n\nWhy Motorpsycho hasn't sold in the American market might seem a mystery, but the explanation may be quite simple. Through the better parts of the 90s, when the band was at the height of their creative powers, Motorpsycho achieved underground success in most European countries. But their music was far too progressive to be accepted by the hype-machinery in Britain, and the lack of success there, combined with limited resources for promotion, effectively hindered the band from being released in the US. It was actually not until the bands 'revolver' album, \"Let Them Eat Cake\", a sort of suicide and rebirth of the band into a much more jazz and pop oriented pack that Motorpsycho decided to try their luck across the pond. Sadly, their new music wasn't as adaptable to the indie-market as their previous works, and their refusal to ever play old songs in concert might just be part of what's hindering them from selling as much as they should do.\n\nFor anyone caring to read this, and who have an interest in progressive rock, lo-fi and the works of Sonic Youth, Pixies and others, I'd highly recommend this for an introduction to the world of Motorpsycho. I promise you that it will change your entire conception of music.\n\n11 of 13 people found the following review helpful\n\n5.0 out of 5 starsDeprived Americans.10 Dec 2000\n\nBy Ivar Dale - Published on Amazon.com\n\nFormat:Audio CD\n\nOk, here it is, once and for all - it is miles beyond my comprehension why this band isn't available in American music stores. I've played it for some Americans with a decent taste in music, and they've all been very excited, having me send them albums from Norway. Now, there's one other band also called Motorpsycho, an American heavy metal band of some sort, don't mistake this band for that one. This Motorpsycho is probably the most highly respected rock band in Norway, they play everything from country and western and indie to psychedelia and epic hard rock and death metal. There's no use in trying to describe them. Just believe me, and try and get a hold of one of their albums. \"Timothy's Monster\" is a definate winner, but the others are compulsory in any record collection as well. They've released a long list of beautiful albums and EPs. Just check it out. They're incredible. And if you're still not sure, ask my friends John and Doug. They're American. Like you. And they love it.\n\n2 of 2 people found the following review helpful\n\n5.0 out of 5 starsmotorpsycho's best album6 Mar 2002\n\nBy torstenkuhnlein - Published on Amazon.com\n\nFormat:Audio CD\n\nivar from norway is just right. Everyone knows Led Zep. Almost no one knows mp, which is a shame. They truly stand out among all other rockbands of today, and I mean all. Their sound is inimitable, songs that are ten or 12 mins long (for good reasons), 100% cinemascope-spacerock larger than life, not less than the soundtrack of the genesis of the earth (The closing song of the album: The golden core!). Maybe Mogwai and Godspeed you bl. emp. were considerably influenced by this fantastic norwegian band. There are really no words to describe adequately the effect of mp-music."}
{"text":"Review\n\nReview Summary: While it might be far too inaccessible for many, for those who pay attention to Torture Garden will be rewarded with a thrilling, arty experience - a classic.\n\n8 of 10 thought this review was well written\n\nTorture Garden is one of those albums of incomprehensible beauty, complete with a creative brilliance that very few men have been capable of reaching for several eons. Perhaps this ethos (the constant will, no, the requirement for John Zorn and Company to innovate to completely irrational degrees) is the sole origin for the original scope which this album covers: it's not an expansive look at beauty itself, but rather a diverse array of the darker sides of human nature. Its ability to build something so wondrous off something so inane is beyond transcendent; it begs one to ask how the application of so many emotions and thought processes, which have been untouched by the world of music in such a way as this (beauty achieved by unreasonable, dysfunctional, and hostile terms), can be translated into an auditory vision. It also begs the question, \"how can it be so good?\"\n\nIt's not a question we can answer yet, but Naked City's approach to this sound, and the emotions which come from it, bring their listeners closer to a complete understanding of its answer. As previously stated, the outfit's beauty is not achieved by any conventional standards, but, if this is so, then how exactly is this beauty achieved? On a musical level, Zorn's latest project, and perhaps his zaniest, is one that atomizes all sorts of conventions for all sorts of genres. When they traffic in rock scenes, they don't focus on riffs, they practice \"dronology,\" and they use ethereal notes. They're world-conscious, slipping (for a short time) into various forms of tribal music and reggae. But the focus of their sound is the intellectual combination of grindcore and jazz, each component just as irrational as the other. They infuse the rapid hostility of the former genre with the saxophone tactics, syncopation, and techniques of the latter; it's all done in such a way that, to the casual listener, it seems completely disconnected. The dissonant musicianship, Yamatsuka Eye's visceral and inane vocal tactics, and the genre-fusion seems unsettling. No, it's off-putting. The way that Naked City defy what were thought to be boundaries is magnificent and challenging, but this is one of Torture Garden's most glorious achievements: it's so enigmatic.\n\nAt first, Naked City's masterpiece seems almost disconnected, but his transitions are there, albeit minuscule and obscure. Tracks like \"Punk China Doll\" use sneaky pieces of jazz to connect one idea to the next, which, subsequently, shows all the layers of these tracks. And trust me when I say there are many. In the hands of this Zorn-project, fugues of noise aren't heaps of nothing, or even heaps of everything; they're intricate compositions, just as important as, let's say, his growling tremolo sax exercises. Under planes of oscillating buzz, the band sneaks in a quiet guitar riff, portentous of what's to come. On \"Osaka Bondage,\" that intricacy seems to have transferred over to the vocal department. Eye's technique strikes unfamiliar territory, specializing in unadulterated shrieks, grunts, howls, moans, and the like, but on this track, he weaves in and out of intriguing instrumentation - more specifically, an arrangement of saxophone, cymbal, and guitar notes. His dynamics, his innovation, and his ability to work with the music, rather than overpowering it, makes his performance one of the most memorable, but to rank one member of Naked City as more important than the other is immoral beyond all comprehension; that's because Torture Garden, though fronted by one of experimental music's most prominent figures, is a collaborative effort.\n\nJoey Baron's performance is noteworthy, consisting of frenetic, jazzy drum work, precise cymbal tapping, and quaint fills; Bill Frisell alternates between a slew of hardcore riffs and that of jazz, proving to be a master of both styles. Similarly, Fred Frith's contributions on bass guitar keep in touch with the band's experimental, arty nature, and Wayne Horvitz's work on the synthesizer gives the band a more diverse sound. Indeed, all the members of the band show their talent at various points throughout the album, but it's not done with solos and other solitary movements, rather, the compositions as a whole require these performances at all times.\n\nTake for example, \"Bonehead\" where Eye's strident grunts, hollers, and moans combat a single, high-pitched saxophone squall. The best parts here aren't from musical proficiency; they're from the band's talent at demolishing any conventions they come across. This carries over to \"N.Y. Flat Top Box,\" a highly comical track that also allows for some technicality, as well as large heaps of inane eclecticism, to shine through. \"Speedfreaks\" is a more adept and serious cut, blasting through different genres every other few bars as \"N.Y. Flat Top Box\" does, but it's not kitschy or humorous. It's like the rest of Torture Garden: bestial, challenging, and highly entertaining. It's not just music (fret not, it's very fun to listen to), but it's an experience as well. It's one that deals with extremes, maneuvering around genres left and right, meshing talent and intelligence together into an enthralling masterpiece. If nothing else, you'll wonder how this band could go from the most vigorous onslaughts to tranquil beauty.\n\nlike \"the band's talent at bending the physical limits of sound\". i mean srsly\n\nlike too pretentious? like the noise and the squeals and such.\n\nand the last line is pretty ugh\n\nI couldn't think of a better way to close. Is it better without anything at the end, just with: If nothing else, you'll wonder how this band could go from the most vigorous onslaughts to tranquil beauty?\n\nbut it's well-written and whatever. you have cut down on being so unnecessarily wordy, too, so that's a good thing. also first naked city album is so much better but opinions and shit"}
{"text":"REVIEWSFern Knight, 'Fern Knight'\n\nPhiladelphia hosts a booming community of psychedelic folksingers, and much like locals Espers (whose Greg Weeks produces here), Margaret Wienk is as influenced by the spacey thrills of the Incredible String Band as by the down-home mumbles of the Folkways catalog. Predicated on a certain preciousness, her group's third full-length features loads of spectral harp, violin, acoustic guitar, and high, sinister vocals (the record closes with an apocalyptically minded three-song cycle, \"The Magpie Suite,\" which borrows lyrics from Milton's Paradise Lost). Regardless, Fern Knight is a delightfully creepy homage to Celtic-Appalachian tradition, and a compelling subversion of traditional folk structure."}
{"text":"Lars Above\n\nThe Intelligence's Rock Smarts\n\nTools\n\nThe Intelligence\n\nw\/Dead People, StabmasterArson\nSat Nov 19, Comet, 9 pm, $5, 21+.\n\nThe Intelligence's music tricks you into thinking you have too much blood in your alcohol stream. Led by Lars Finberg, A Frames' hell-raising drummer, they wreak havoc with your equilibrium in a looser, more squalling manner than that band's scathingly bleak dynamos.\n\n\"If anything, the Intelligence are ripping off [Erin Sullivan's] and Min [Yee's] old band Bend Sinister,\" Finberg modestly states. If that's so, then Bend Sinister must have ruled. The Intelligence's 2004 debut, Boredom and Terror, abounds with hooky garage rock that's filtered through the dusty post-punk lenses of the Fall, Swell Maps, and Devo rather than following the dog-eared Nuggets manual.\n\nStranger Personals\n\nBy contrast, the Intelligence's new full-length, Icky Baby (which is split between solo Finberg songs and full-band efforts featuring drummer Matthew Ford, bassist Calvin Lee Reader, and guitarist Nicolas Brawley), sounds much more aggressive than Boredom and Terror. While the first album was instantly accessible in a wonderfully weird way, Baby takes more effort to discern the tunes beneath the clamor. \"As far as the songs that I recorded by myself, I just got better with the eight-track and the mastering is a lot louder, something I really regret about the first record.\n\n\"The songs with the band, though,\" Finberg continues, \"naturally make stuff gnarlier than it would be if it was me recording everything in my living room. Brawley and Reader come from this great band Popular Shapes that was fast and noisy, and I think at times it sounds like me playing with their band rather than the other way around.\"\n\nBoth Intelligence albums flash by in 25 minutes. Finberg's songs concisely, pugnaciously make their exhilarating points, then vamoose. \"I think all our songs need is verse-chorus-verse-chorus-done, at least when I'm writing them,\" Finberg says. \"And we've had complaints about them being too short, but I feel like I'm bullshitting [by] putting more stuff in sometimes. Plus, I'm really lazy and if you come up with a bridge or a third part, that can just be another song. Or maybe I'm insecure and just want to get out of there.\""}

{"text":"As pretentious as it seems for Akron\/Family to title their latest album Self-Titled II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT, it begins to make sense once the enormous peaks and valleys of their music unfold widescreen in front of your eyes. The band has spent nearly a decade experimenting in folk, psych and sampled soundscapes, but Cosmic Birth explodes like the landmark record every band strives to make. It's a sprawling epic that finds the trio creating from one unified and concentrated mind. During their amorphous live shows, it's not uncommon for Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and Miles Seaton to constantly switch roles between the myriad instruments littering the stage. In speaking with Seaton, it's apparent that Cosmic Birth was recorded with much of the same communal execution.\nWhile Akron\/Family was once thought of as merely understudies to Michael Gira (Swans), or maybe a poor man's Animal Collective, the new album should debunk any preconceived notions regarding the group's mission. There's plenty of evidence that Cosmic Birth was a clean slate for the trio or a reset freeing them to be overly loud, increasingly complex with their arrangements, and wildly ambitious. Unfortunately, in this day and age, ambition is often seen as indulgence. But while Cosmic Birth's ingredients reflect the prog pomp of King Crimson, the mellifluous intricacies of British folk and the boho-mysticism of the Grateful Dead, not a decibel or note seems wasted on the record. If more bands were to adopt the exercise Seaton and the band refer to as \"groupthink,\" the world would be a much better place and ambition wouldn't be such a dirty word.\n\nSo why have you chosen to title this album Self-Titled II? Is this a continuation of your very first record or of the same spirit?\n\nMiles Seaton: It was more a desire for us to get back to the intimacy and the recording principles that we established with the very first record. It felt like we were starting fresh and having this new experience with one another and our music. There was a level where it felt magical and like the first time we ever recorded. Plus we actually sampled a lot of stuff from our first record.\n\nHave you recorded with Chris Koltay before? What did he bring to the table? The sound on this record is louder and more intense than anything you've done in the past.\n\nMS: We did the last record with him, so we knew what to expect and what we wanted to do. There was a conscious choice on our part to use a lot less layering. There's a lot more space that's been pushed a lot harder as far as volume is concerned. There's a whole lot of distortion that comes with everything being smashed. It created a lot of color and harmonics in the overtones of the record. We knew that Chris was the guy who could get that sound for us.\n\nDid being in Detroit provide any kind of inspiration in recording the record?\n\nMS: Oh yeah, it's an incredible place. There's a lot of fantastic history there. The feeling of that city is almost Mad Max. It's got a post-apocalyptic atmosphere with nature reclaiming the landscape through the bones of the crumbling architecture. It's a very poetic place in my opinion. It was summer then and very beautiful, and we were riding bicycles on the interstate.\n\nIn the press release it claims these songs are \"relics of a new tomorrow\" and that \"these are new beginnings.\" Can you elaborate any more on the meaning of that?\n\nMS: All of us are in a place where we're starting to discover a new stride in the future of our music. This record\u2014the process of envisioning it and the feeling around it\u2014we discovered a lot about ourselves and how exciting music can be. That wording is part of the whole mythic, poetic language of how we are describing our music and how we engage with it. All of us have made a conscious effort to not drain the magic out of the process of creating music together. We are honoring that, not worrying about being cheesy, and realizing how precious this musical process is to us. We don't want to be the guys who just say, \"Yeah, play in a band.\" That's fine if you want to write your story like that as a musician, but that's not the story I want to live in.\n\nSo then is there an overarching concept to Cosmic Birth? Is there a story that aligns it all that needs explanation?\n\nMS: Not particularly, but it is the story of us becoming super inspired and envisioning a truly wild and boundless way of creating music, which all of us strove to accomplish. When we were planning the record there was a lot of writing, sending pictures, recording strange sounds and sending those things back and forth between us. We were making huge dream boards where we were trying to tie all of those things together as a \"groupthink,\" as Seth likes to call it. Some of it comes out abstract and poetic and then some of it is more just imagery and the idea of rebirth. The character of Shinju TNT, he kind of represents that idea and he just sort of appeared to us out of the ether one hyper-caffeinated afternoon.\n\nThe record is certainly an ambitious undertaking. I'm curious to know how you will take Cosmic Birth out on the road. You are well known as a particularly enthralling live band, so how will these songs affect the shows?\n\nMS: We've always tried to keep the music moving in the concept of a tour. The top-half of the show has been the rock stuff from this album, and it has been pretty rocking, pretty heavy. We're trying to be more high energy and trying to be more concise. We're also trying to incorporate some of the really early stuff into that mix. But I feel like this time around, with all of the rock stuff we've been doing, it's almost punk because there's a very excitable quality to what we are doing currently."}

Are all the guys in the same room with the drummer so you have the same ambience?\n\nDG: It was 16 bit ADAT in the studio. The drummer and I were in booths with Brad (Jones, the bassist) behind partitions. The horns were in another room and there was a main room where the piano and the organ were. I picked the studio because it was a nice room, acoustically, and everybody could see each other visually. It's important to have the band thing. It's pretty much all live...you know.\n\nAAJ: How long did it take? Like a second, right?\n\nDG: We tracked basically for two days..\n\nAAJ: Man, you guys are unbelievable...\n\nDG: I went back into the studio to do \"Confluence , because Imani (Uzuri-vocals) couldn't do it at the time. Actually, we aborted a previous session in January...I had James Genus instead of Brad on bass...the studio just didn't work out...the piano was out of tune...I had to pull the plug finally. I did have a finished version of \"Confluence from that session but I ended up throwing it out. We rerecorded it as a trio-bass, guitar and vocals.\n\nDG: Actually, she's on Herbie's new record, Future 2 Future. She wrote some lyrics for one of those tunes. I only heard parts of that cd so far. I met her a couple of years back through friends of mine. I just always loved the quality of her voice. She doesn't do \"jazz gigs..I heard her on her own gigs...drum'n'bass. She has a really rich deep kind of voice. At that point I wasn't thinking of her for my stuff, but as it turns out we collaborated and she wrote lyrics to \"Confluence . That date wasn't easy for her, but she certainly managed to pull it off.\n\nAAJ: How'd you get the rest of the band ?\n\nDG: Like I said, Brad was a sub. Now Brad has turned out to the better choice for this kind of music. I mean I love James but Brad has this looseness from playing with Ornette.\n\nAAJ: Ornette?!\n\nDG: Oh, yeah. Ornette, the Jazz Passengers, Marc Ribot. So the core band was there. The sidemen made sense. I mean part of it was just that I knew guys who were willing to do me huge financial favors for the music. I knew Rodney ( from Wayne, and he has this jazzy jazzy, but funky, other way of playing.\n\nDG: I think I met him through Binney ( who's also on the cd.\n\nAAJ: And Ravi and Ralph Alessi are through Steve Coleman?\n\nDG: Yeah.\n\nAAJ: And you're on Ralph's new thing?\n\nDG: That's not out yet. Check RKM for that ( I've got some space on that one, but I was disappointed with the amp I used for the session. That's some hard music too. Don Byron's on it as well as Nausheet Waits and Drew Gress.\n\nAAJ: Your record seems like a natural progression from Coleman to Lost Tribe to Trilok to your own thing, as opposed to some other directions you've gone in with other folks.\n\nDG: I guess it comes out of all those experiences...you know, playing with Steve and Trilok...though osmosis it's crept into my system. But even before I met Steve and the whole M-Base thing I had an attraction to odd meter music or whatever you want to call it. I was into Return to Forever and Mahavishnu and all that stuff.\n\nI was introduced to playing jazz when I first started taking guitar lessons at age 15, with John Baboian, a teacher at Berklee School of Music. Then I kind of worked my way backwards into straight ahead jazz. But I was always into that type of music. The stuff I'm doing now, at least the Ritualism thing, has got the odd meter stuff. I just find there to be a lot of unexplored territory, you know, with rhythms as it relates to modern jazz harmonies and melodies. I mean jazz in the rhythmic sense has been pretty much in 4:4 with the occasional 3:4 and that's...\n\nAAJ: That's it! That's what I really want to touch on with you. This is what Steve is known for and now you. You are one of the masters regarding this aspect.\n\nDG: Well, there are other people, but a lot of them come at it from a different angle, like Brad Shepik with Pachora and the Commuters (AAJ interrupts)\n\nAAJ: Yeah, but they're coming from ethnic rhythms.\n\nDG: Well, they're using things in 11 and 21 or whatever. Steve's thing has evolved within his own projects. Like it used to be \"this tune is in 5 and \"this is in 7 , but around \"Rhythm People it evolved into polymetric tunes. It went further with \"Black Science where the pianist was in one meter, the bassist was in another and I was in another and the parts would intersect at various points creating cross-rhythms.\n\nAAJ: Well, this is the wonderful complexity of your music.

{"text":"Electric Wire Hustle\n\nElectric Wire Hustle\n\nBBE\n\nsoul\n\nFresh, Challenging, gracious and profoundly moving, Electric Wire Hustle is a modern day classic.\n\nI would like to think Mara TK, Tayy Ninh and Myele Manzanza left the busy-ish metropolis of New Zealand's capital city Wellington for some small, hidden place within the greenery, situated amongst changing warm pacific breezes and glittering rays of sunshine to craft their stunning debut album. A self-entitled masterpiece, such is the feeling of dedication to beauty; the backdrop surely couldn't be anything else.\n\nRealistically though, it was produced over the course of a year and half, in various studios with borrowed equipment and a lot of love and patience from friends and family.\n\nTayy, multi-instrumentalist and co-founder of the group, orchestrates a 13-track, complex but guided journey through modern hip-hop, soul and psychedelia.

Just lend an ear to romantic 'Again' or horn-led swing throwback 'They Don't Know' if you think the comparison is too dear.\n\nOther standouts include electronically cosmic 'Thank You Steve' and aggressive 'Burn,' highlighting the bands strong moral beliefs with marching style."}
{"text":"Artists:\n\nFind it at:\n\nMusic from this release\n\nThe realization that a great band has made a terrible record marks the point of pivot where you stop thinking about what's happening as a listener and turn into something like a forensics expert asking, \"what happened?\" The best case scenario is that an outside pathogen is to blame, a failed genre experiment, an ill-fitting producer, drugs. These are the things cult classics and critical reclamation projects are made of. The inside jobs are far more painful to endure-- records such as Travis Morrison's Travistan, Weezer's Make Believe, the Smashing Pumpkins' MACHINA\/The Machines of God and the Streets' The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living that clearly couldn't have been made by anyone but their creators, but where the same qualities responsible for such individual and affecting works of art have completely turned on their owners. Mumps, etc. is of the latter variety, an often unlistenable album from WHY?, a group whose music is often excellent.\n\nIt might sound counterintuitive to claim that restraint would've worked to WHY?'s benefit here. A large part of the appeal of records like Alopecia and Eskimo Snow was that they let Yoni Wolf run rampant lyrically and emotionally, all while his band exploded the boundaries that would have kept them in either indie rock, hip-hop, or even \"indie rap.\" No matter what Wolf was going on about-- masturbation, his bowel movements, any number of ex-girlfriends-- his extremism was tethered by relatable emotions and strong hooks. Whether it was the result of taking an unusually long time off between records or not, Wolf has sunk even further into himself, but not to discover some sort of deeper truth about the human condition. Instead, a sizable portion of Mumps, etc. turns out to be a longform rumination on what it means to be Yoni Wolf, Lead Singer of WHY?.\n\nDoesn't matter if it's The Wall or from the perspective of a guy who admits, \"I make decent cash, I'm a minor star,\" as Wolf does on \"Sod in the Seed\"; the \"lot of the touring musician\" album has a great track record of establishing the frightening point when an artist feels entitled to a listener's empathy despite having their most distorted sense of self. Yet it's not unthinkable for Wolf to find pathos in this scenario, since at WHY?'s level of success, \"how can I keep this up?\" is more a crisis of relatable age and economic concerns rather than that of a poor lil' rich boy in a gilded cage. But it's nearly impossible to find Wolf's situation interesting because I'm not sure he thinks it is either.\n\nHe repeatedly references the end of his \"rap career\" as something of a given and bemoans its terrible mundanity-- \"I can't sleep in rental cars or airlines\/ Yo, and so I keep the deck of cards for downtime.\" Either that, or he gets lost in impenetrable metaphor as a means of distracting from that mundanity. During the sickly mariachi lurch of \"White English\", Wolf engages in impressive verbal gymnastics in order to avoid saying what he actually means, and it's summed up by its diffident hook: \"Lost in translation.\" Same for \"Thirst\", which introduces potentially loaded metaphors about black cowboys and discarded porn-stuffed G4 motherboards without delving far enough into their symbolism; when Wolf pleads, \"He will always thirst like that\/ He will thirst like that always,\" it fails to register. He might thirst like that, but how the hell are we supposed to know what \"that\" means?\n\nBut when really getting to the bottom of why Mumps, etc. often sounds like it wasn't subject to outside QC, it isn't so much about Wolf's lyrical inscrutability but rather that long stretches of the record are just really fucking hard to listen to. Musically, it's perfectly fine and a logical dovetailing of Alopecia's sharp hybrid of hip-hop and indie rock with Eskimo Snow's forays into post-rock and folk, if maybe sidling a little too close to the sort of Danger Mouse-style pop-hop it knows it can't be.\n\nAnd that's because Wolf has completely lost a grip on judging his own vocals. They've always been an acquired taste for sure, and on Alopecia and Eskimo Snow, Wolf showed a canny command of his various modes of monotone, staggered rapping, heartsick crooning that packed unorthodox pop smarts. As Wolf attempts a more perfect union of those various modes, he ends up with a hybrid that somehow manages to bring all of his most grating qualities to the fore, to the point where the actual words of a line like \"when I got better from the mumps, yes-- my swollen nut and neck shrunk\" are the least objectionable thing about it.\n\nCombatively nasal, all jagged edges and botched notes, Wolf makes an irreversible, disheartening slide into Borscht Belt jokes about his advancing age (\"I'm in decline\/ But women like be jockin' still\/ 'Cause I rhyme with skill and talk so chill and youthful\"), retreating hairline (\"Girls used to fawn over my locks-to-kill\/ Now the girls are gone and I'm on Minoxidil\") or inescapable whiteness (\"Rockin' soccer socks and sandals like, 'yeah, bro.'\") . Technically catchy but irritating all the same, \"Jonathan's Hope\" and \"Strawberries\" are the inexplicable singles, and as Wolf sings brutal rhymes such as, \"Slow pitching like a Vatican priest to be pope-- what? Dope,\" or, \"Your mom she sits while her hair is in curlers\/ Smokes weed and listens to that Garrison Keillor\/ That's how I'll live when I quit my rap career,\" there isn't so much of a melody as a curdling effect taking place in Wolf's mouth, like he's having an allergic reaction to his own lyrics. There too are remnants of Anticon.'s willfully arrhythmic approach to hip-hop on \"Jonathan's Hope\" and \"Paper Hearts\", the latter of which might be the most unpleasant song of 2012. A noxious merger of topic, content, and delivery, Wolf cruelly describes a failed romantic encounter in flagrante: \"She's cute with little titties and a sense of humor\/ But to tell you the truth sir, I pity the poor fool-- her,\" and, \"During sex I might put us in some joke positions\/ But it's scary always how we end up in mission...airy like the daring men who fight to submission,\" aren't even the half of it. While there's no such thing as TMI in WHY? songs, it's nigh inconceivable to imagine someone listening to this for enjoyment.\n\nAt the very least, Mumps, etc. creates a new wrinkle in discussing what \"career suicide\" can really mean. It's usually attributed to albums so off the grid that fans will inevitably refuse to follow, yet those always strike me as a cry for help, a need to trigger a reaction. But I don't think that's the case here. Mumps, etc. does have its moments that remind you how WHY? have always been a trial by fire that demands and often rewards intense loyalty that can't be shaken easily. On the contrary, Mumps, etc. sounds like WHY? reading their own eulogy. Sure, Wolf claims, \"I'll hold my own death as a card in the deck\/ To be played when there are no other cards left,\" on the closing song, but \"Exegesis\" ended Alopecia making the same exact threats, so make your own \"cry Wolf\" joke if you must. It's just that so much of Mumps, etc. thinks of itself in the future tense, having already given up the fight. Even beyond Wolf's decidedly pessimistic take on his current occupation, most of the songs on Mumps, etc. just seem to opt out of delivering hooks when they could or should and meekly tap out before three minutes.\n\nBut to really get to the heart of Mumps, etc.'s despondence,you have to look at \"Distance\", paradoxically the most musically accomplished and lyrically affecting song here. The sighing strings are a bit manipulative when Wolf says, \"I gotta keep my distance to withstand the silence of you missing when you're not there to listen to this nonsense,\" yet it's a real moment of resonance, and you're just left to wonder why such a typically candid lyricist took so long to get to the point. The structure of \"Distance\" would lead you to believe \"men and women might yet quote his modicum of the truth\/ But never will they get right close to Jonathan Avram Wolf\" is the money quote, but it already happened. Because while Mumps, etc. expresses that Wolf is too in touch with his emotions to not potentially have great art left in him, it's just that I'm not sure even he believes WHY? is the best place for him to work it out anymore."}
{"text":"One of my recurring jobs over the years has been to meet and interview famous people from various fields - music, art, architecture, you name it. Most of what I record and transcribe is, of course, surplus to requirements and is accordingly left on the cutting room floor. This blog is the cutting room floor with, of course, the 'golden quotes' that I took out for my articles left in, with, as an added bonus, all the ticks, hums, sneezes, dumb questions, fluffy answers, and 'y'knows' as well.\n\nArcher: Yeh, so that should be quite exciting. We're in Belgium for the England game. So, there you go. You can't complain.\n\nCBL: Well, wish them luck. Anyway, I'd like to say I was really impressed by the album and I consider myself a fan now.\n\nArcher: Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nCBL: Right, so, it stood out a lot from a lot of the other records I've been listening to and it sounded quite different at first.\n\nArcher: There are some great British bands out at the moment but there isn't much of a sound. It's like a guitar band. Sometimes you can hear a real comparison to Libertines to Arctic Monkeys, there is a common thing. Whereas we were always more dance music, reggae, so we would never try to be part of a scene or anything like that. So we sort of stuck out because of the music and that's been the continuing of the result.\n\nCBL: I get the impression that a lot of the other bands are very historically aware of the music, like Franz Ferdinand, there seem very. clear references to 1980s bands like Magazine and so on. You're music when I heard it - at first - it was very hard to pin down, then, of course, I started to figure out the reggae, dub, ska thing, but its not so obvious.\n\nArcher: We sort of sat there - thanks very much - we sort of sat there and didn't want to kind of like this, \"Let's do a ska number.\" It was more like the spirit that influenced it rather than... Why try to recreate something like that because you're never going to be able to better it. It's kind of like a moment in time....so we kind of listened to a track and said, \"Woah, that'll work...but just because we might use a reggae-type bass line, it doesn't mean that we have to have a reggae drumbeat. Why can't we play it over a drum and bass feel or something like this. At the time our plan was to release a record on our own very small label - Necessary Records and we weren't really thinking\u2026\n\n[untranscribed segment]\n\nWe weren't sat there thinking \"What's hot at the moment there in London, and what's going on?\" Rather we were doing what we liked, trying things out. We try out a lot of things. A lot of them are rubbish. A lot of things don't work. But occasionally you come up with something that sounds really cool.\n\nCBL: I also got the impression that a lot of the quality of the music comes from the lyrics I mean\u2026you alright there?\n\nArcher: I think we were just then writing songs about what our own lives, and what we saw around us, what we saw in our friends lives. What we saw on the TV. \"Middle Eastern Holiday\" was written back in the day when the Iraqi war had officially finished and six military policemen were murdered by a mob in Basra. People say, \"You know that could be me. That could be my mate.\" And it starts making you think in a different way. You stop seeing it in black and white, and start thinking, \"What if I was out there? I would be scared shitless.\" Both sides should be at home doing what you are doing going out, washing your car.\n\nCBL: Especially the circumstances in that particular case. I remember reading about that. It was a real cock up by the British army as usual.\n\nArcher: Yeh, yeh. That was where we were at. We were trying to take it from thinking about people just like us. We've never seen ourselves like\u2026 You do get certain people, especially in the music industry thinking like they've got a superiority thing, where they think they're better than other people, to say \"You don't read the right books, you don't wear the right clothes, you don't hang out at the right places, you don't know the right people, you ain't got the right haircut.\" We've never been like that. My thing is you're cool because you follow your own path and you do what you want to do and you don't let other people influence you in doing what they think you should do. We've always tried to reach out for the ordinary people, the people who are just like us. Most people are just ignored. They are just sort of force fed what people want them to have, and they have to take it, and that's wrong. If people are not like the front page of the latest style mag or whatever, they're still the same to us....We've sold a million records and we've done five nights at the Brixton Academy, which no other band has done except for The Clash, Bob Dylan, Massive Attack and the Prodigy, and we've done all those things and yet we've never had an NME front cover, and like the NME's always cool with us but we were never one of those charming [around] with the press, so it always surprised people that we have been as successful as we are. We've bypassed those people and reached the real people out there.\n\nCBL: I think the way it works is because you don't follow the crowd\u2026and so you're different. If you're different, you stand out and people notice you more. That seems to be working in your favour. Most bands are a bit arty farty aren't they?\n\nArcher: Yeh, yeh. Always amazes me. What's so arty, what's so cutting edge? All these sort of art school bands that ever appear, they're so cutting edge: \"Check this out - we've got drums, guitar, a bass, and a singer and we're going to play music that sounds like it was written 25 years ago.\" Why is that so much more new and groundbreaking and cool, because you know it isn't. It's just like rehashing something.\n\nCBL: I kind of see that in class terms, because that kind of attitude that you're describing there is a kind of a middle class thing and your music's much more of a working class thing. It's gritty and natural and saying what it means.\n\nArcher: Yeh, I think so. It's always a kind of weird one when you start talking about class. We want to appeal to everyone. We don't want to appeal to just the working class. But a lot of people can identify us with that. But at the end of the day that's where we come from. We've never sat there ... That's the way it is. [to waitress] OK, thank you.\n\nCBL: So, anyway, have you been to Japan before?\n\nArcher: Yes, we have actually. We were there in November for a flying visit. We were there for a week. Had a great time, actually. One of those things where - we did a show in Tokyo and we did a show in Osaka, and. amazing, it was like another world, but similar in many ways. But a lot of people were saying that the crowds would be very polite, y'know, and they'll clap between the songs, and be aware of that. When we played Tokyo, the moment we hit the first chord the place erupted, it went crazy - quite like [gatrbled]\n\nCBL: Yeh, it's quite different from the UK, anyway. For one thing there's not so many CCTVs hanging around spying on people.\n\nArcher: Yeh, that's one of the things we've kind of found as we've been around lately is that people don't actually know what we're talking about in that respect. It has become a massive part of their lives. I'm sure it will at some stage. [garbled] That's our guitarist jamming in my ear.\n\nCBL: In the wider social content. what do you think the advent of the CCTV camera symbolizes? ...Did you get that?\n\nArcher: I think for me, it's always been about saving money. It's cheaper to get someone to look at 20 screens in a room than it is to actually say, \"We're going to get enough policemen. We're going get them out of their fast car, and we're going to get them to actually reintegrate with the community to be\u2026to go out there are talk to people and have a relationship with them. Rather than be like this kind of distant authoritarian force. Maybe you can stop things before they happen, rather than look at things on tape afterwards. But that costs money and takes time and it's easier to put up new cameras and then deal with it later. The UKs always been about saving money, kind of a cheap fix.\n\nCBL: Yeh, cutting corners. Yeh, one of the reasons they don't need to do that in Japan\u2026 Japan has much less crime and a lot less violence for sure. One reason they don't have to do that is because a lot of people share the same values. It's all soft power. In the UK, everybody's a bit different, right, and that creates a lot of aggro, and everybody's got their own agenda, and so society can't use that kind of soft power to keep everybody gently in line like what they do in Japan... did you hear that?\n\nArcher: Sorry, I lost you on that last bit.\n\nCBL: Yeh, I'm just saying that the main difference that I've detected is that in Japan they use a kind of soft social power. People usually share more or less the same values and so on, and in the UK it's much more diverse, and so that creates all these\u2026 Nobody really knows what's right and what's wrong anymore. You know what I mean?\n\nArcher: I can see that. We kind of noticed that when we were there. Everyone has a lot more respect for each other, and so a lot of the situations don't arise. It's funny how one of the most technologically advanced nations on the planet doesn't need to rely on technology for keeping the streets safe or whatever.\n\nCBL: So far you've been writing your songs very directly from your experience from where you've lived, and now with the success, you're lifestyle's changed a lot...\n\nArcher: I'm still living in the house I've been living in for a lot of my life actually through various circumstances.\n\nCBL: Yeh?\n\nArcher: The thing is to try and remain in touch with the people who are your audience, your fans. A lot of what we done has always been out and about [garbled] People are so made up. It sort of gives them hope. It shows that it can be done. A lot of the songs were written while we were still trying to get this record out. It took so long to come out We did it ourselves but it was a lot of hard work.\n\nCBL: Yeh.\n\nArcher: I was writing all that time.\n\nCBL: So, you're going to stay in Staines? You're not going to do a Billy Bragg and move out to some mansion in the country, are you?\n\nArcher: Well right now, I'm still Staines. It's handy for the airport.\n\nCBL: Yeh \u2013 aha!\n\nArcher: It just takes 10 minutes. You're home in 10 minutes. No plans to move yet.\n\nCBL: It fits in quite well, then.\n\nArcher: Yeh - all my life I'm trying to get out of it. Now, when I'm away, I miss it and realize that it's quite convenient.\n\nCBL: I was reading a piece in the Guardian about you opening pubs with the mayor and giving beer to a horse. Is this a kind of anti-rock star kind of thing?\n\nArcher: Pub near the producer [garbled]\u2026 I had to jump on a plane and go and do a TV show in France, but all my mates could get drunk. There you go. Those are the breaks.\n\nCBL: OK right, It's been very nice speaking to you Richard, thank you very much. That should be plenty to work with. Thanks.\n\nArcher: yes thanks mate, I'm sorry it's been a little bit noisy cafe.\n\nCBL: Yeh, hopefully I'll remember most of it if the tapes a bit dodgy. OK cheers.\n\nArcher: I'll hopefully see you. I think we're in Japan in September.\n\nCBL: I'll be here. I'll be back from my Summer holidays. It's so bloody hot here.\n\nArcher: Wow, I bet.\n\nCBL: It's the wrong kind of hot. It's humid. You're coming at a good season. September , it's a good time to come here."}
{"text":"Widowspeak \u2013 Almanac\n\nWidowspeak's second album, Almanac, begins with the lushly detailed, surf-tinged 'Perennials'. The song is in line with the pristine jangle pop Widowspeak's label, Brooklyn's Captured Tracks, has come to be known for, but its canyon-wide spaciousness immediately announces that the band has freed themselves from any expected lo-fi trappings.\n\nFollowing 'Perennials,' the rip curl guitar of 'The Dark Age' and 'Locusts' offers a rougher-edged variation on this sound, the latter a sort of smoky waking dream of a '60s soul song. But elsewhere, songs like 'Sore Eyes' ditch the shoreline altogether, instead conjuring the dramatic shifts of colour, light and shadow seen in the endless skies of the American southwest.\n\nMeanwhile, 'Minnewaska' is pastoral psychedelia in the sense that it actually sounds as if it was recorded in the middle of an open field, with the low buzzing of insects providing ambiance and golden acoustic strums rounding out the vast, woozy mix.\n\nThis open-air feeling speaks to the primary difference between Almanac and its predecessor; Widowspeak's self-titled debut played like a dusty book populated by faded watercolour depictions of distant locales. Despite its title, the fuller Almanac suggests a three-dimensional take on the flatter Widowspeak LP. This time around, the more vivid songs are almost like actual places that listeners can inhabit. Listening to the wheezing 'Thick as Thieves', a track which channels the haunted melancholy and nautical atmosphere of Beach House's first album, is akin to taking a lonely walk through a cobwebbed and decrepit seaside mansion.\n\nFor all the variance in tones and textures, each song on Almanac is a unique scene from a distinct world; importantly, it's a world that belongs solely to Widowspeak. Despite a backward looking quality that even permeates the album's folksy, faux-vintage artwork, Widowspeak don't sound especially reminiscent of anyone in particular. Sure, there are shades of aforementioned Baltimore duo Beach House, as well as Fleetwood Mac at their most expansive and enigmatic and Mazzy Star's spacey, majestic gloom, but Almanac is about as intoxicatingly strange and difficult to decipher as smoke signals cast on a windy day. This ensures that Widowspeak are mining their own territory, but it also makes the album a little more distant and less transporting than totally immersive experiences like Teen Dream.\n\nThere's a general brooding feeling that underlies each song, but this is second to a dreamlike remoteness that prevents us from getting too close or understanding too much. Some will perceive this as iciness and give up on Almanac, others will be drawn in by the mystery of vocalist Molly Hamilton's bewitching, beckoning presence and the album's malleability. It's psychedelically inclined in a way that feels tailored for directionless road-trips and desert holidays. But it's also windswept and forlorn enough for solo, late-night listening sessions, and swooning and alluring enough to beg inclusion on romantic mixtapes. If you're willing to spend some time in Widowspeak's headspace, chances are you'll find yourself wanting to roam Almanac's enchantingly surreal landscapes a little longer each time you visit."}

{"text":"Author Archive\n\nThere are three types of bands who can prominently feature relatively unknown album cuts in their live set lists and have it make sense to me. The first are bands that are in relative infancy. They don't have a large discography to draw material from, so they wind up performing most of the songs they've recorded. Their fans aren't let down because if they didn't like the one or two albums that the live material draws from they wouldn't be there. When I see Titus Andronicus this summer, will I be upset if they play every song from \"The Monitor\"? No! That's why I'm there.\n\nBands with devoted, cult-like followings should also feel free to play just about anything they want. In fact, Phish heads would hold an eternal grudge against Trey Anastasio if one of their live sets resembled a greatest hits collection. What would they brag about on the Phish.net forum if not hearing \"Corina\" for the first time since 1998?\n\nThirdly, great bands that have built a career out of meticulously crafting albums (as opposed to staying afloat with decent records that feature a couple memorable tracks) should play whatever they want. If Wilco wants to delve deep into \"Summerteeth\" or Radiohead wants to play eight songs from \"In Rainbows\", no one should feel cheated if they didn't hear \"Jesus, Ect\" or \"Creep.\"\n\nGuster, who performed in front of 900 laid back fans at Northern Lights Wednesday night, doesn't fit any of those criteria.\n\nSome bands are just pros. While I will concede that there is something electric about seeing a band when they're first breaking out, some veteran acts combine a safely guarded spark with a wealth of experience to continue delivering the goods live. Guster is one of those bands.\n\nI was lucky enough to see their command of pop song craft on full display at Union College's Springfest last year, and their jangly guitars, propulsive percussion and sweetly blended harmonies will be sure to delight the crowd at their May 4 show at Northern Lights, a high energy venue located in nearby Clifton Park."}

As such, the audience that gathered to see her was more curious than anything else. One concertgoer, while ordering a drink at the bar, referred to her as Hannah \"gor-gas.\" Someone else nearby insisted on repeatedly saying \"Hannah George.\"\n\nIt's probably pretty safe to say that those people aren't going to be making that mistake anymore.\n\nOpening with 'Bang Bang You're Dead,' Georgas and her band kept the chit-chat to a minimum while pounding through much of the album's excellent pop nuggets, including spirited performances of 'Let's Talk' and title track 'This Is Good.'\n\nSurprisingly, Georgas didn't play either 'Dancefloor,' her most instantly addictive song from 'This Is Good,' or 'Thick Skin,' otherwise known as \"the song with the video where a naked Hannah Georgas crawls through mud.\"\n\n\"We didn't have enough time to do it!\" Georgas told Spinner afterwards. \"We got cut. 'Dancefloor' was coming and we didn't plan 'Thick Skin' into the set tonight just because we wanted to keep it really rockin' the whole time. But 'Dancefloor,' that happened because somebody came up and said 'You've gotta go.'\"\n\nDespite being given the hook, Georgas, originally from the GTA, was genuinely exuberant having played her first show at Toronto's famous Horseshoe Tavern.\n\n\"I've seen so many great shows here,\" she said. \"I was so looking forward to this, so excited.\"\n\nShe's also excited about being nominated for the Polaris.\n\n\"I follow Polaris and it's a huuuuuuuuuuuge honour to just be in the caliber, and to be with these artists and to be recognized [for] something that's positive and people are digging.

Love the band name and love the track. Indie pop rock with attitude. The main hook is particularly infectious.\" - Sarah Champion, Absolute Radio\n\nIC1s are a London-based indie rock group that have built up a huge fan following as well as rave industry reviews. They have shared stages with The Cribs, The Charlatans, Bloc Party, and Buzzcocks to name just a few.

How about that? Or as our vocalist Dan puts it \"Reacquainting you with the hairs on the back of your neck!\" Modestly put.\n\nWhat makes your music unique?\n\nNowadays, there aren't a lot of bands who are, everything's been done so unless you are playing a sitar with 1 string upside on your head and sing in latin it's hard to be unique in its true definition. It's not generic and we aren't trying to do something fashionable, I think we are fairly unique when we look around at what other bands are trying to do.\n\nWhat inspires you to write songs?\n\nOur lives and experiences, the real things. It's strange, a lot of popular music at the moment is about glorifying money, so you have all these people singing along about their 'Benz' and their bank accounts, when they don't drive or have anything, I find that quite funny. We certainly sing about more realistic things, our song 'Not Perfect' is about a girl who isn't good enough for you, but she will do! and 'Whack Jack' is about a stalker!"}
{"text":"One of the best online music resources to emerge in the last couple of years has to be The Hype Machine. For the uninitiated, The Hype Machine is an aggregator of MP3 music blogs that allows punters to search for blogs and websites that have both written about a particular band and also made an MP3 available 'for evaluation purposes'.\n\nType in the name of a band and it returns a list that you can plough through and listen to right there on the page, or alternatively follow the links to the original sites and read more. Think of it like a Google that returns nothing but music and reviews, and to understand how comprehensive the service is, how deep it digs into the lonely corners of the internet, you can even find reviews on and music by Friends of the Stars.\n\nA statement such as 'it's an aggregator of Mp3 music blogs' would have made absolutely zero sense as little as 5 years ago, so we're very much not in Kansas anymore, and it hasn't taken long for savvy folk to cotton on to the fact that blogs are a great way of reachinga wider audience. Equally, it hasn't taken most music bloggers long to realise that there is a living to be made and free music to be had by producing a regular and trustworthy source of new music and comment. PR and Record Companies are now desperately cosying up to the very people they recently wanted to shut down and it seems even your Grandparents could explain to you what a Tastemaker is.

{"text":"Kinky\n\nAtlas (Sonic 360\/Nettwerk America)\n\nThe release of Kinky's sophomore album, Atlas, perpetuates Mexico's domination over the rest of the Latin American rock scene. It reflects the band's determined search for an organic dance rock sound that feels way more vivid than the original set of loops, samples, and prerecorded songs it presented on its 2001 self-titled debut. Yet bilingual lyrics again play a crucial role in its crossover to a Western audience. The optimistic first single, \"Presidente,\" is a perfect example: \"De qu\u00e9 color es nuestro presidente?\/Verde, rojo, blanco es el presente\/You paint everything in color\/Instead of black and white,\" sings Gil Cerezo, who wonders what color defines President Vicente Fox. He's breaking down the three colors in the Mexican flag while wondering which would best suit the leader (\"Is he Green\/Greedy?\/Red\/Pro-war?\/Or White\/Pacifist?\").\n\nConceived on an isolated ranch in Mexico and completed in Los Angeles, Atlas unveils several exciting gems. John McCrea, who leads the Sacramento altrock band Cake and toured with Kinky last year, is one of their believers. McCrea sings a Colombian cumbia called \"The Headphonist\" with Cerezo, one of the album's highlights. Equally remarkable is \"Snapshot,\" rooted in an old Mexican style known as quebradita that's very popular on both sides of the border. The rest goes easily with the flow."}

In addition to exploring squirmy subject matter in their lyrics, Bellhaunts can just plain blow your ears off, as with the achingly sweet track \"Herd of Fake Spiders.\" What's next? A new four-song EP and some gigs at Tropics Lounge and Alex's Bar.\n\nAdrienne: I would sing Dion's \"The Wanderer\" around the house as a kid. He was my official vocal coach.\n\nWhat's it like working together as siblings in the same band?\n\nAdrienne: I bug him a lot. It will be after midnight, and I'll say, \"Hey, do you want to play this for me right now?\"\n\nJoshua Santellan: It's different when we argue because we're related. If we fight, she'll just tie me up to a fence with her bicycle chain.\n\nAdrienne: Are you still mad about that?\n\nJoshua: It was a rolling fence! There is no other band where you can be like, \"Yeah, we just ran our lead singer over with a bike, and she was totally cool with it.\"\n\nYour lyrics are so personal; is it difficult to sing about such emotionally charged material?\n\nAdrienne: No, but I do cry a lot. I'm really sensitive.\n\nJoshua: Anyone can bitch about his or her girlfriend onstage for 30 minutes or some bullshit like that. She's able to explore her feelings through her songs and lyrics that have a deeper meaning.\n\nRobert Ramirez: Our song \"Party Time Genocide\" is really disturbing, but it's a satire.\n\nAdrienne: It bothers him because it's about mutilating genitalia.\n\nRamirez: I'm a dude, and it hurts.\n\nAdrienne, where do you get inspiration to write your songs?\n\nAdrienne: Jesus [laughs]. A lot of my music is pretty dark. My mom worked at a mortuary, so as a 5-year-old, I'd be there with dead people, watching my mom comb their hair. She would show me where they pulled out the blood and put in the formaldehyde.\n\nSongs like \"Abortions for All\" seem more political. You sound pretty pissed-off.\n\nAdrienne: I was watching this Morrissey documentary. The first thing I heard was \"Morrissey thinks the human race is disgusting.\" I get angry at things I can't change. I can't destroy what's going on in the world, but I can sing a song about it."}
{"text":"Discovery of the Week: Doc Dailey and Magnolia Devil Doc Daily and Magnolia Devil, who you should really be listening to already. Now.\n\nAll the music I love the most has an indescribable element to it. It's not the notes or the lyrics or the groove: it's something deeper underneath. It's a quality of the soul and emotion in a song that can't be described in words, which is a beautiful thing, but also a real kick in the pants if it's your job to describe music with words.\n\nThere's a lot of Americana and indie folk out there these days, but Doc Daileyl sets himself apart with his ability to truly, emotionally connect the listener with the stories he's set to song\u2013 again, it's that indescribable thing. Doc sings with such an empathetic spirit that the specific people and stories he tells transcend to the universal.\n\nSad songs are hard to do right. Sure, plenty of people have made a career out of them, and scores upon scores have tried, but there is a fine art to telling a sad story that people actually give a shit about. There's a very small sweet spot between the vast polarities of the typical, petty, woe-is-me, overly affected list of unrelatable, personal f*ckups and music that's so depressing that it leaves you catatonic, balled up in the corner, shirtless and sobbing into a bucket of on sale ale and fear by the time you get to track three.\n\nDoc Dailey hits that sweet spot. Doc and company make sing along sad songs. It's a tradition as old as music itself, but not may people do it any more.\n\n\"Picture Frames\" could easily be the postmortem written by the now grown baby in George Jones' \"The Grand Tour.\" It's an absolute heart breaker, but the story is told with such a reflective, peace-making point of view that all you want to do is hug your family or even the random family standing next to you (proceed with caution if they have kids\u2013 or, you know what, just skip it if they have kids. Could get creepy. Hug an old person or something\u2013 they're always down for it).\n\nThe songs aren't all tear-jerkers. \"She Has Her Moments\" is a scorching tell-off that probably makes the most spiteful use of the lyric \"Buttercup\" that's ever been in a song. You can download that track right here:\n\nYou can stream and purchase all of Catch the Presidents in the widgetbelow, and you should.\n\nThe album's given the band a nice lift on their listening trend here on Last.fm since its release, but undoubtedly once word continues to get out about it, we'll see those numbers grow even more."}
{"text":"NEEDTOBREATHE \u2013 The Reckoninig\n\nThe Reckoning is the fourth album to be released by Southern Carolina rock\/alternative band NEEDTOBREATHE. In the past they have peaked on mainstream charts with their uplifting music. However, they have topped more charts within the Christian music sector making it hard to forget that they are not a Christian band, but simply just Christians.\n\nThe album is made up of fifteen tracks which unfortunately fail to excite. Each track is up to, and sometimes over, four minutes long which makes the songs slightly tedious and long winded. After the chorus has been repeated for the sixth time listeners may find themselves wanting to hit the skip button. Given one track seems to run into another because each song sounds the same as a previous song on the album this makes for difficult listening. They all hold the same kind of instruments, the same sort of lyrics and the same kind of messages.\n\nOpening song, Oohs and Ahhs, lasts for five minutes and is very repetitive which doesn't express much optimism for the rest of the album. The song does get a little heavier about a quarter of a way through with the introduction of a drum beat and an electric guitar which making it comparable to some of Maroon 5's old tracks. However, because the song lingers on for so long listeners could find themselves getting bored and wanting to turn the album off as soon as the song finishes.\n\nThe two tracks that really defy away from the majority of the album are Drive All Night and Keep Your Eyes Open. Although they both sound similar you get the feeling that they hold a lot more emotion than previous tracks. Drive All Night is a softer more uplifting song; the drumbeat echoes a heartbeat and paired with the undertone of the piano and Bear Rinehart's distinctive voice it bleeds inspiring lyrics and urges listeners to turn it up as the crescendo increases. Keep Your Eyes Open also screams inspiring lyrics, telling listeners to stay strong and move on. It's a song you could put on during a sadder time and it would rejuvenate any kind of mood.\n\nThis album is definitely not one of the best works of NEEDTOBREATHE and they may find it hard to shake their 'Christian band' image as a lot of their songs sound spiritual. Leaning towards boring and repetitive, it's not something that you would be able to listen to without pressing skip once or twice."}
{"text":"Find me on\n\nGiven that several of its members worked on the music for the hit Broadway musical \"Fela!\", it's no surprise that Brooklyn's Antibalas sounds newly energized on its latest album, the group's first since 2007's \"Security.\"\n\nNot that Antibalas needed any further instruction in the force of nature that was the late Fela Kuti, but the group's new self-titled album is the kind of taut statement of purpose that could come only from a band eager to get back to the business of being one of the finest U.S.-based Afrobeat ensembles working today.\n\nFor further proof, see what happens when you put the ferocious album-closer \"Sare Kon Kon\" on at your next party. Anchored by a racing bassline that feels capable of pushing the song further ahead until sometime next week, the song is a delirious blend of twisting, hard-hitting horns and call-and-response vocals that might merit a warning label as a fire hazard.\n\nAlways key to Afrobeat's propulsive energy, the group's seemingly effortless, air-tight rhythm anchors the galloping drive of \"Ari Degbe,\" which features a gritty keyboard melody, while tracks such as \"Dirty Money\" and \"The Ratcatcher\" honor Afrobeat's roots as the music of social protest. Fela Kuti may fade from glitzy playhouses, but Antibalas will make sure his spirit stays on the streets. - LA TIMES"}
{"text":"The Birthday Massacre are an oddity, and believe me that is a compliment. A perfect mixture of Alice in Wonderland and the stuff that nightmare's are made of. The Birthday Massacre are the thing that hides under your bed when you sleep at night and takes great delight in scaring the hell out of you.\n\nThe band's last album \"Pins and Needle's\" was a deliciously dark slice of guitar driven goth rock, that could single handedly soundtrack the entire Tim Burton filmography, however such is the way with The Birthday Massacre they have taken a trip even further down the rabbit hole with their latest album \"Hide and Seek\" and things taken a turn for the creepy.\n\nThe first song to be released from the album 'Down' showed signs of the harder edge that the band had previously displayed, but that may have been misdirection on the bands part, as that is the only track of that ilk on the album. This in turn makes it a standout. With this album The Birthday Massacre has taken all they have accomplished up until this point and refined it into a more layered and mature sound, without losing any of the elements that made them so popular in the first place.\n\nThere are more textures and indeed more depth to the songs on \"Hide and Seek\" that makes it less immediate than its predecessors, but also means that the songs need to be drawn out more and gives you as listener something to work for. it will leave you with a more rewarding listening experience. The synths which has always been the bands trademark have been toned down, leaving the soundscape with more of a wall of sound, and in some places a Nine Inch Nails during The Fragile era presence to things.\n\nWhilst on the lyrical and vocal front Chibi appears to have toned down the crazy and delivers a more vulnerable and honest approach on this which gives the album a deeper emotional resonance than normal, lyrically the album is also more personal and stripped back than normal, as the band usually relies on story telling through disconnected or metaphorical lyrics whereas this time things seem to be more out in the open.\n\nWith \"Hide and Seek\" the band has created their most mature and intriguing album to date, an album that shows where the band has come from and hints at where they may go in the future. They have finally come of age, and now finally know who they are and what they are capable of. With this release The Birthday Massacre have proved that they are unstoppable."}

The old warehouse next to PigPen studios worked pretty well and the rain drops complimented Drew and Dylan's song nicely. It was a song we'd heard them play in clubs around town, but the surroundings gave it a slightly different charm.\n\nWe liked the idea of the guys standing on top of a box car, but none of the boxcars had roofs and nobody wanted to walk around on a mound of wet sand for the duration of the song. In the end we still were able to use the box car, and the guys' energy gave the soundie more life than we could have hoped for in such a seemingly restricted space."}
{"text":"Tristan Prettyman\n\nCedar + Gold\n\nTristan Prettyman wrote Cedar + Gold after her breakup with Jason Mraz. The album weaves a tender storyline that is emotive every step of the way.\n\nIt crosses a heavy beat with sweet female vocals and lots of instruments. It is artistic and emotional, but feels like it was twisted and manipulated by record executives, resulting in a pseudo-artsy album.\n\nThe meandering guitar of \"I Was Gonna Marry You\" (she was engaged to Mraz) chasing the violins is reminiscent of a free jazz form, but with a sexy beat and familiar melody. The bouncy banjo and happy vocals of \"Quit You\" give a random, yet oh-so-catchy bluegrass twang halfway into Cedar + Gold. \"Bad Drug\" includes a seagull soundscape, electro-mixing, and several faux-dubstep drops\u2014and it feels more like a soundscape than a straight song. The mainstream guitar-drums-bass tune \"Come Clean\" makes for the strongest song she has to offer, or perhaps it's the Katy Perry meets Taylor Swift sound-alike track \"When You Come Down.\"\n\nCedar + Gold feels like a collaboration between a group of very talented musicians\u2014but musicians far too diverse for their own good. The vocals are smooth and emotional. The instruments are played and mixed skillfully. But musicians just cannot have an experimental soundscape on the same album as a happy-go-lucky bluegrass tune, next to a Florence + the Machine wannabe track and heavy bass over half of it. Cedar + Gold is a tender story with pretty melodies, but that doesn't make up for its scattered-ness"}
{"text":"ABOUT THIS ALBUM\n\nAlbum Notes\n\nFormed in 1997 by Canadian musicians Chad York and Mike Peacock, Odd-time signatures, thoughtful lyrics, dissonance, and improvisational solos, the constraints of traditional pop music are eagerly shrugged off as this tight little band attempts to break as many rules as they can while still creating a vibe that is as accessible as it is thought provoking. \"It's like a game you play with yourself. You stretch the boundaries as much as you possibly can and still try to maintain that accessibility, to have that 'catchy sound'. We've found our way of challenging ourselves to simplify! We aren't rebelling in the traditional sense, we don't bite the heads off bats, we are just two guys trying to write and produce music of substance\"."}
{"text":"Review: Low continues to soar 20 years on with new album, 'The Invisible Way'\n\nThe husband-and-wife team of Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker form the core of the Duluth, Minn.-based group Low. Their latest studio album, \"The Invisible Way,\" is a glorious culmination of 20 years spent honing a slow-tempo, melodious sound with arresting male-female harmonies and cerebral lyrics.\n\nProduced by Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy and engineer\/producer Tom Schick, the album's overall sonority is an almost mesmerizing union of sparse and lush \u2014a dichotomy of sound similar to Radiohead's marriage of bombast and sublime.\n\nLugubrious and wistful, Low's music may come across as too melancholic for some. But while plumbing the infinite store of human sadness and broken-heartedness, Low does so with a poetry so rare in popular music, it's exhilarating.\n\nThe album begins with \"Plastic Cup,\" a haunting, exceptional tune that references the affliction of substance abuse, replete with both irony and mourning.\n\n\"Just Make it Stop,\" sung by Parker, is absolutely gorgeous songwriting and the record's standout. It's gut-twistingly beautiful.\n\nListeners please note: There is beauty and soulful enrichment in melancholy. Take it"}

Something Fierce don't sound anything like above-mentioned, although it is undeniably pop-punk. Instead of ugly haircuts and high-pitched vocals, think about The Buzzcocks, The Clash and The Undertones. But then experimenting with popmelodies. And the end result is just really cool. For fans of: The Buzzcocks, The Undertones, The Drums, Male Bonding\n\nOf course, we couldn't forget the metal-fans amongst you. Alcest's new album came out, and may be somewhat of a shock for the black-metal fans. Because on this album, Neige (the brain behind the band) pushes the black-metal elements to the background, making way for progrock and melodic metal elements. And if a song bursts open, it mostly does so in a shoegaze fashion, instead of a black metal cascade. So yeah, it's pretty different from Alcest's last outings, but is it any good? Well, yeah, actually! For fans of: Ghost Brigade, Agalloch, Anathema, anything with Neige playing in it\n\nIn essence, Mark Van Hoen (an Englishman, not a Dutchie) is an ambient artist. But he always balanced on the line of ambient. And this album seems to cross it. Take 'Don't Look Back' for instance. It's more a dark eclectic avant-techno, than ambient, isn't it? It's pretty indescribable what music Van Hoen does make here, but what would you expect from a founding member of UK electro-shoegaze pioneers Seefeel and, later, Locust and Scala?\nOh, and the pretty awesome album-art is by Stephen O'Malley of Sunn0))). For fans of: Autechre, AFX, Deepchord\n\nWhen we write these blogpostshings, we're always looking for things that differentiates each band. Let's not do that now. There's no big producer here, no well-known special guests, no anonimity for promotional uses, no weird gimmicks. This is just a simple indie\/folk record. From a 20 year-old guy, who sounds like he's seen the entire world already. Rob St. John makes beautiful songs with an assignable head and tale ('Your Phantom Limb') and songs in which he's looking for the experiment ('Stainforth Force'). And he gets away with it all.

{"text":"Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks: Fixin' to thrill\n\nStephen Malkmus and the Jicks: High five for the lo-fi Photo: Leah Nash\n\nWith a new Beck-produced LP under their belt, Stephen Malkmus and his Jicks continue to thrill\n\nAvailing of his days in 90s underground indie sensation Pavement, Stephen Malkmus is still regarded as one of those musicians to be spoken about in hushed, reverential tones. Following Pavement's acrimonious breakup in 1999, Malkmus threw his rather high-profile eccentricities into Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, making meandering, and frequently ingenious, post-rock and pop(ish) albums with titles like Real Emotional Trash. Yet for the band's fifth full-length, Mirror Traffic, Malkmus has stepped away from the producer's desk, offered the reins to Beck and, in his own words, tried to make something \"relevant.\"\n\n\"I guess the marketplace determines how relevant something is, or just how people relate to something, if they can groove with it,\" says Malkmus, reached at home in Berlin. \"That's still a process that is being figured out, but people that write blogs about music like it. They like most things though. People are going to be mostly positive about most things, I think, it's not a really hateful world out there. I don't really know what I'm trying to achieve. You hear it when you know it on some songs by other people, if they've got the good spirit to them and good quality rock and roll that we love. We hear it in others, but you probably can't hear it in yourself because you're deluded by the effort or hope.\"\n\nThe influence of Beck on Mirror Traffic is unmistakable, and represents an inspired, if not somewhat unconventional, fit. For Malkmus, long the producer on every Jicks record and single, stepping away from the boards was actually easier than he thought.\n\n\"I didn't really know what [Beck] would bring to it and what his sound would be,\" reveals Malkmus. \"As it turned out, he went for a clean, slightly lo-fi sound, like I wouldn't call it hi-fi in terms of being wet and big, like somebody who was being fancy would be. Sometimes he wanted things to sound thin and small in a way, in an old-fashioned 60s way. You never really know what you're going to get when you work with somebody. We just went in and started, and then it was the sound coming out of the speakers. There was no effort to reprocess things like a big rock band or whatever. He's not into tricks and big, blown-out sounds. He's coming from a musician's side first, and I reckon that's comforting. You don't come away feeling worked into something you're not.\n\n\"Mirror Traffic is kind of weird within its parameters. There are some standard chord progressions, but if you combine it with my lyrics and voice, and the way the Jicks are playing around them, it's still kind of like pop punk or something. All the harmonies and melodies together\u2026 I wouldn't call it sophisticated, but it's really heady at times.\"\n\nStephen Malkmus and the Jicks Pop Montreal at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Corona September 23"}

It's full of the same quirky lyrics, infectious tunes and banging beats that'll keep you dancing along, but the more you listen, the more you'll find.\n\nThere's a lot of thought behind the words, and right from the get-go you're introduced to the message, that we need alternative news sources to be able to see through the information politics that M.I.A. asserts stops us seeing the full story behind everything that's going on in the world; and you know, she may well be right.\n\nPerhaps the most unexpected side to Maya is not the mesmerizing message, but how much M.I.A. actually sings; from heart-felt interludes like \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Space,\" and even in the sassy pop catchiness of \"XXXO.\" As with any surprise, it's the things you didn't know you were missing that make you open your eyes. And that's how these tracks are: fiercely juxtaposed with the hard-edged rap electronica and the incessant industrial backdrop that pervades the rest of the album; like poetry in a war zone.\n\nSo you're going to find a lot of what you expected and a lot of what you didn't. M.I.A. is as individual as ever in this brilliant and well-produced release, but don't go thinking it's an easy listen \u2013 it's clearly not intended to be.

Contrarily, if the name \"Jane's Addiction\" is less about the serialized sound of a band and more about a cadre of musicians constantly looking to experiment and broaden their aural horizons, then \"The Great Escape Artist\" is perfectly adept at carrying the umbrage of the title \"Jane's Addiction.\"\n\nIt's been nothing short of an odyssey for Jane's Addiction, winding their way through breaking up and reuniting, hiatuses and activations, albums and tours.

{"text":"This' an interesting label, I've been tasting a couple of their releases and I find they've an exciting roster above all if you're into experimental music if names like Francisco Lopez, John Duncan or Tetsuo Furudate still mean a thing, well you don't need any other comment. This release is quite warm and with that I mean releases like \"Commonwealth\" are in some ways severe but humane, not just for the most of the sound sources\/instruments used, I think it has to do much more with the audio essence of the music. Basically this cd consists of a forty-nine minutes suite evolved around something that sounds like an organ drone which reminded me much more of some La Monte Young than of Xenakis but yes it also brings somehow very close to some compositions of Elian Radigue as you can read in the press sheet accompanying this release. I know many would be tented to compare the sound source to some Pauline Oliveros and I don't think that would be completely wrong, but believe me, for the first twenty minutes it's really monolithic and it takes time before it starts softening changing note and giving the ambience a more relaxed atmosphere, but don't worry this softening will leave the \"non-indulgent\" nature of the record untouched. Thought I don't think this work has been exactly meant to be a dark ambient suite, it goes from massive to crepuscular, infact if during the first half the drone is brawny with the first part of the final decreasing the music becomes really obscure while also inexpressive while approaching the end. \"Commonwealth\" by some means is a classic work you if you're into \"single drone oriented\" release that's for you."}

{"text":"Five albums into a career that's taken many sonic twists and turns along the way, the Hidden Cameras' musical mastermind Joel Gibb keeps pushing the boundaries of his artistic vision, drawing on the vast and varied talents of the small army of contributors who drift in and out of the indie collective at any given time.\n\nDespite establishing the Hidden Cameras as a vital part of the close-knit Toronto indie scene over the past decade, Gibb decamped for the artistic hotbed of Berlin in recent years, splitting his time between both cities as he pieced together what would become the band's ambitious new release, 'Origin: Orphan'.\n\nGiven that the Hidden Cameras is a benevolent dictatorship -- Gibb laughingly prefers to think of himself as the \"musical director\" -- revolving around Gibb's theatrical, melodic tunes, one would imagine it might have been tricky to corral the troops to record new material when their ringleader was halfway around the globe.\n\n\"Well, I never really went away,\" Gibb tells Spinner during a trip back home to Toronto. Trim and dapper in a pale trench coat, he's fighting exhaustion even before embarking on a lengthy North American tour in support of 'Origin: Orphan,' but perks up when discussing the album.\n\n\"The record was recorded over many different times, so the earliest sessions would have been during [previous album] 'Awoo.' 'He Falls To Me' and 'Colour of a Man' were done then -- and they were worked on over the following years,\" he explains, noting nearly all the songs on the new album were written long before his move to Berlin and fleshed out during the recording process.\n\n\"Some of them were recorded without the band, too. 'Underage' was all done by sampling little licks that I would play and then the horns were overdubbed in Toronto. Same with the title track -- it was all just my guitar and this one tiny little keyboard. You don't need 20 musicians and a big string section to get a big sound.\"\n\nThat's somewhat ironic coming from a man who led the trend towards sprawling indie-rock collective. The Cameras' elastic membership has seen several notable artists come and go from the ranks -- including Gentleman Reg, Laura Barrett and Owen Pallett of Final Fantasy -- and the band's albums still continue to feature whoever's available.\n\n\"You don't have to be on the record to be 'in the band' and you're not necessarily 'in the band' if you're on the record. It's really just about what the song needs,\" Gibb says. \"I have certain limitations, too, but that doesn't mean I want my music to be contained by my own inabilities. I'm sort of an okay musician on a lot of different instruments -- so the studio is a way for me to play different instruments, because live I don't really get to do that.\n\n\"But even though I write the songs, everyone in the band brings something unique to them.

The paint faded scenes of wasted life, where people would rather sit in front of their laptops than talk to each other, teenagers who travel by bus and get away and dead malls.\n\nThe fact that people often sit in the car when they want to escape everyday life and the financial crisis means that many songs are purely thematically and reminiscent of some of Bruce Springsteen's most beloved, gasoline-powered night ballads. Sometimes it feels like Arcade Fire has parked rock hymns like \"Stolen Car\" and \"My Hometown\".\n\nThe difference is that Springsteen's characters have less money in their wallets. And Arcade Fire's lyrics are never as vivid and as close as the popular short stories from New Jersey. But they compensate their textual deficiencies through a long and colorful parade of brilliant pop melodies.\n\nArcade Fire comes from an indie scene in which \"less is more\". But just as in the two previous albums, \"Funeral\" and \"Neon Bible\", more really is more. The songs are just as magnificent as David Bowie's serenades \"Teenage Wildlife\" and \"Because you're young\" from \"Scary Monsters\".\n\nOr as one shoegazerband recording a CD with Queen. Arcade Fire does not fit in small clubs. They want to drown the audience in the world's largest arenas and festival scenes."}
{"text":"Dr. Frankenstein: The Cursed Tapes\n\nREVIEW\n\nIf you've ever wondered what rockabilly music was like from a country like Portugal, then Dr. Frankenstein can give you a pretty good idea.\n\nThe Cursed Tapes is a collection of tracks inspired by the sun and sand. Of course, coming from someone who calls themselves Dr. Frankenstein, you can expect a hint of darkness enveloping the tracks as well.\n\nYou'll find 5 tracks in this short but punchy compilation. Officially kicking things off is Necrofago; this fast paced 5-minute number combines strummy guitars, steady drums and some good old surfer vibe. It's a really good way to start the record.\n\nIt's followed by O C\u00e9rebro do Morto, which sounds like it belongs in a James Bond film from the 70s. This same retro feel makes the song easily likable as it makes the listeners feel as if they've known the song since before. Emergency Exit, and Theme for \"The Mad Thinker,\" continues this vintage vibe. The record is capped off by a slower track, Have You Seen It? Although this is quieter, it doesn't diminish the energy from the previous cuts. It seems to be the right song to play as you enjoy that special sunset by the ocean side.\n\nThe Cursed Tapes would make great company if you ever find yourself heading out to the beach to catch some waves. It's a compilation filled with funky surf rock and a tad hint of gothic flair. You can grab the album as a free download. Simply hit the link above and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've heard quite a bit about Magic Magic\u2013 from their Phoenix accolade to their international praise from press giant The London Times, they've gained significant recognition with the release of their self-titled LP. They've got the theatrics, harmonies, and infusion of orchestral detail like pop-glam band of Montreal, and have been consistently compared to a band actually from Montreal, Arcade Fire. The Baroque pop edge of Magic Magic make them an easy comparison to these bands, and groups like The Decemberists, that make a dramatic production of each song. However, in the way Brian Wilson used the theremin to create a dark and haunting mise-en-sc\u00e8ne to the sunny \"Good Vibrations\", Magic Magic is able to produce generally cheerful melodies aided by the xylophone and seemingly upbeat vocals while still beautifully chanting lyrics with a gloomsday glow.\n\nI slip in the 9-track disc, and I find myself immediately confused by the very first track \"Over Your Heart,\" that begins like the opening to a Wes Anderson flick. Then, I'm entranced by the androgynous voice, pairing masculine words with a siren-like coo. I can't skip ahead to the second song because I want to hear what will happen next. The narrative, for me, is not in the lyrical glaze, it's in the poeticism of the orchestral layering. The glittering effect of what sounds like a sitar and bells with the melancholy of the strings, tell a story of grandeur.\n\nThe album continues with the theatrics, and I am only getting more invested as I continue to listen. They are self-defined as having a lounge style, but I'd say the cabaret is more in line with a variety show. While I do understand the importance of lyrics, my interest is held by the moving picture show in my head inspired by the sounds. I applaud any band that can use the creative talent of a painter to take me somewhere other than the ordinariness of Boston in 2009. While each of their songs gives me an appropriate dose of escapism, my personal favorite is the particularly dark and alluring \"Jellyfish.\" Without knowing the name of the track, I envisioned soldierly slaves marching in chains chanting \"We've got the best of you\" on a decrepit ship\u2026in the middle of a storm, of course. But even after I learned what Track 6 was on my iTunes, I felt like this song moved like the free-swimming jellyfish (no, please, not to reference Jack Johnson), mimicking the movement of the gelatinous umbrella as it dances through the dark sea with chain-like tentacles. Though not all tracks seem to be as seriously ominous as \"Jellyfish\", there is a great fluidity to the debut album released by the five-piece storytellers.\n\nWith Magic Magic I'm guided through a fantastic continuum of dark magic and space, war, and the romantic overtones of John Murphy's desperately hopeful voice. If Wonka did, in fact, sell his candy company to Charlie for the price of a chocolate bar, and decided to open a music factory, I'm sure Magic Magic would be the sweet product."}
{"text":"MS MR are the latest edition to the Chess Club family. Can't tell you much about them other than that they are from New York and were recently the Guardian's band of the day or week or whatever accolade it is.\n\n'Hurricane' is described by the band as 'tumblr glitch pop' which is an excellent example of a band defining themselves in completely retarded terms. They basically make modern grandiose laptop pop music like pretty much everyone else does nowadays. 'Hurricane' is an attempt at soulful electro-pop but it doesn't really hit the spot. The female vocals aren't up to much and the tune is tasteful enough but a little bland for my liking. It just doesn't stick with me.\n\nFlip it and we get a demo of 'Bones' which I assume will pop up again at some point. It's a piano led power ballad that brings to mind Florence And The Machine due to its synth minimalism making way for grand, string led choruses with rolling kettle drum samples and the like. It's a more cohesive, memorable tune than the A-side but it's still a bit dodge Hurricane by MS MR"}

{"text":"When we were introduced to the infectious and innovative fusion of New Wave, dub and electronica four years ago on Santogold (as she was then known), Santi White struck a nerve with critics and crowds around the globe.\n\nThe concern with creating a genre is that your next step is crucial, which is probably a worthy explanation of why Santigold took an Olympics lapse between her debut and its successor. How does one tread the tightrope without falling into either hipster wank or selling out? The answer on Master of My Make-Believe\u2026is effortlessly.\n\nMOMM-B is every bit as creative as its predecessor, but this time provides more consistency. Producers Diplo and John Hill have been retained, but this time aided by Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Foster The People, Sia, Ladyhawke.) This time, the record sounds more like one unified genre, as opposed to songs from different genre songs shoved together.\n\nWe've already been treated to the Karen-O (Yeah Yeah Yeahs) featured GO! and album highlight \"Disparate Youth\" as singles, but the gems are a dime a dozen here. Kurstin works his production magic on the catchy God from the Machine, while This Isn't Our Parade could be Santigold's best song to date. Swinging madly between solemnly gothic and proudly pop via calypso, it is percussion heavy and seductive. In the wrong hands, it would have been a hot mess.\n\nThe only problem MOMM-B faces is the absence of a sure-fire hits like Lights Out and L.E.S. Artistes, the latter which won my Song Of The Year in 2008. \"Santigold catapults iPod immediately after it finishes.\"\n\nDespite this, MOMM-B is fresh, polished and further indicative that Santi White is more than the Master of her Make-Believe, she's the Master of Modern Pop. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Okay, I don't think I actually need to spend any time writing about how this band sounds, as you can probably hear it in your head before you even press play with a name like that. Except of course, for the fact that there is also apparently a metal band under the same moniker.\n\nSeriously though, it's not exactly surprising that they're ridiculously cute and sound like they're smiling through their teeth while recording, but sometimes that's exactly the sort of thing you need. Perfect for when you need to cheer up a little."}

Since their site is short on bio info, I don't know much else about them. However, they seem to have a damn good sense of humor.\n\nMusically, they bang out infectious guitar-driven rocking numbers. The hook to them is that all of the band members sing at once. They aren't necessarily harmonizing but it still lends a very layered sound to the vocals. I'm also loving the drummer. The guy seems to be all over the kit at once.\n\nFrom what I can tell, they aren't signed to a label. However, they recorded an EP last fall that they aren't selling yet. The two tracks below are from that recording session. Hopefully, they'll be selling it soon though because I'd love to hear the other three songs."}

{"text":"Interview #657: Team Me\n\nThu, 2011-04-14 16:39\n\nPop dreamscapes, boy-meets-girl harmonies and star-gazing orchestration driven forward with jaunty percussion - the self-titled EP from Oslo six piece Team Me prompted a little further research from the I Like Music team, resulting in a spate of questions fired across to the band. Here's what they had to say...\n\n\"I Like Music because\u2026 music likes me!\" Team Me\n\nILM: We really liked the Team Me EP :) For those yet to hear its wondrous sounds, how would you describe it?\n\nTeam Me: Thank you, we are really happy with the EP! It's basically five pretty straight forward pop songs with pretty weird and quirky instrumentation. The arrangements might be a little odd as well... ;)\n\nILM: Your artwork and design is great! How did that come to be? What's the ethos behind it?\n\nTeam Me: Our keyboard player Simen made it together with Synne, our female lead... :) They have their own little art collective called APPARATET. They basically listened to the songs and the lyrics for a while, then they came up with it. I think the idea was sort of like an introduction to some sort of a world, a different kind of world, some kind of reality escape I guess. A team me-bubble in a way. That's why there is a kaleidoscopeish pyramid, the door, the little boy and the pond.\n\nILM: What's the story behind Team Me. How did you meet and when did you get together?\n\nTeam Me: It all started with this Demo-competition back in Norway about a year ago. Team Me (Team Me being a solo project at the time) was selected as one out of ten finalists and I basically had to get a band together and perform a couple of songs during the demo-competition-show. I simply phoned up some of my friends and asked them if they were interested in doing one show, one show only. That didn't happen, hehe.\n\nILM: Is there a shared vision for the band?\n\nTeam Me: The idea and the fact that music should be something positive and constructive.\n\nILM: How would you describe your process of making music together?\n\nTeam Me: It always starts with an idea, a verse and a chorus, a melody and some lyrics. The songs are finalised by all of us, together in the rehearsal room.\n\nILM: What's the music scene like in Oslo?\n\nTeam Me: There are a lot of really nice things going on in the underground scene in Oslo, that's basically where we belong or at least that's where we feel like we belong. Here are some really hot tips: Twin pines mall, Einar Stray, Kr\u00e5kes\u00f8lv, Ludvig Moon, Uno M\u00f8ller, Bel Senna, Moddi, Bendik, Truls and Trees, Mount Melody.\n\nTeam Me: The new Radiohead record, The King of Limbs, and the first Rockettothesky album has been frequently played on my iPod.\n\nILM: Out of all the live shows you've played so far, which have been some of the most memorable?\n\nTeam Me: We actually did a showcase at KOKO in London a month ago, that was pretty sick.\n\nILM: Who \/ what are your biggest inspirations?\n\nTeam Me: Since we are six individuals in Team Me, as you can imagine, it's really a lot of different things that inspire us. I think we inspire each other and the fact that a lot of things are happening with the band at the moment makes us really inspired as well.\n\nILM: What are your future plans?\n\nTeam Me: PLay more shows, record our debut album, smile, enjoy and hopefully do even more shows... :)\n\nILM: Anything else we should know about Team Me?\n\nTeam Me: Team me fun fact: Our drummer Bjarne started playing drums at the age of three. He is now really into curling and 90`s Norwegian black metal"}

{"text":"Men\n\n(Sick Room; US: 7 Nov 2006; UK: Unavailable)\n\nForm of Rocket: Men\n\nThe guitarist of death-punk outfit Form of Rocket is named Peter Makowski. There is a song at the end of the album titled \"Peter Makowski Has an Aneurysm\". I'm not sure what his father, Ed, thinks of this. Ed is a classical music guru. Why is this important? Because I've been working with Ed for years in music retail, and he kept talking about his son's band, and now their long-gestating debut is in my CD player. Strange, huh? Though it's doubtful that Ed would dig the song about his son's aneurysm, he can still appreciate that if you're going to do a rock album as dark as this, you might as well go full out. Song titles like \"Teapot Dome, Bitch\" and \"Dogfucker\" give you an idea of the contents inside, and even with the dry production and uninteresting guitar flourishes, their sense of melodicism is undeniable. The aforementioned \"Dogfucker\" is, in fact, a gut-wrenching and tragic ballad about loving a woman so much\u2026 until she commits the act mentioned in the title. \"You'd Look Cute in the Trunk of My Car\" is Blood Brothers on a budget, and they don't sound half bad. Though someone needs to throw a professional producer their way, it's still a stronger-than-it-has-any-right-to-be debut. Good job Ed\u2014you should feel proud."}
{"text":"Pages\n\n29.6.11\n\nThe Vaccines - What Did You Expect From The Vaccines?\n\nThe Vaccines are an indie rock band from the UK, formed in 2010, the band have already gained success after their debut album, What Did You Expect From The Vaccines?, reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nOpening track Wreckin' Bar (Ra Ra Ra) begins with a drum and feedback combo that projects a potentially loud energetic sound from the band, but the sound is sadly a fraction of that potential. The guitar is quiet, and bares a typical trebled to the max effect to produce the traditional indie sound that we've been familiar with for years. But aside from what the song could have been, it features great vocal harmonisation from the band which helps create a very catchy start to the album.\n\nThe vocals really drive each track forward, frontman Justin Young's voice is naturally similar to other artists, which I suppose makes it perfect for this record, as it sounds like a mixture of Julian Casablancas, Joey Ramone, and even a touch of Morrissey on the track A Lack Of Understanding.\n\nThis album has a borrowed feel to it; The Vaccines haven't produced any tracks that sound original, but tracks that are heavily influenced by bands such as The Strokes and Ramones, without building anything new to them. It may not be original, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable, it's full of the basics of rock n roll and little else, which means it's practically impossible to hate it. But what makes it so likeable, also prevents it from becoming a must-listen because everything has been done already, especially the chorus on track Post Break-Up Sex, as the chord progression on its chorus has been used in many many different songs before, such as Justin Bieber's Baby. (At least, that's what my sister told me\u2026)\n\nDespite its lack of originality, What Did You Expect From The Vaccines? is a very accessible album that is full of fun, energy, and has a sunny quality that makes it perfect for the summer weather we're experiencing. It's full of straightforward bursts of rock n roll which has been missing in 2011's discography lately."}

But there are also a lot of well-intentioned meaningful things that appear amongst his projects.\n\n\"I get emails all the time from people, 80% of them being jokes. Like, I can't give you advice on your actual sex life.\" Sometimes there's so much emphasis in roots on the wisdom of life experience and hardship, but artists like Shiplett are still young and the advice he's giving is more like what someone would get from \"their cool, drug addict older brother,\" he laughs.\"Terrible advice\u2026 I try not to take music so intensely. I love music and it's been a long journey for me. There's times when I want to write a sad song and there's times when I want to have fun and getting people dancing.\"\n\nHis comparably sincere lyrics are thought-provoking and he's helped people get involved with music through past efforts like The Hus (Daniel Huscroft) and Banger (Shiplett) Society, which gave kids access to good quality instruments. \"It's like hockey, kids don't play anymore because their parents can't afford to pay the fees.\" The music programs in schools are also falling apart and many studies have shown that the tangible progress and excitement of creative outlets raises grades in other areas.\n\nShiplett's bio describes him as a \"songwriter in every situation\" and I ask him to elaborate. \"Well, I spend a lot of the day making sure I'm always singing about anything that's happening around me. I'll be driving and I'll have road rage and I'll just sing the person a song: 'ASSHOOOLE,'\" he chimes. \"It's not something that you turn on and off, it's something that you do all the time, it's who you are.\" When he's with friends, they make things up on the spot and \"most times they end up pretty country. Sometimes we freestyle rap, depending on the mood.\"\n\nHe filled the Ironwood last time he played and, this time, he'll be backed by the five-piece Red River Rebellion, sharing a bill with Huscroft and playing his more upbeat songs. \"Daniel's a really good buddy with a lot of the guys in my band, so it'll be a fun night \u2014 might get a little bit out of control at times.\"\n\nCatch their show on the 11th at Palomino, and check out Huscroft and Shiplett's side project Cowboys and Indians' destructive music video, \"It's a Wonderful World.\""}

{"text":"Featured Articles\n\nThe Sleepy Jackson: Black Steele in the Hour of Chaos\n\nThe Sleepy Jackson: fewer members, more tracks\n\nDressed all in black \u2013 pants, shirt, cravat, jacket and scarf \u2013 with a plume of equally dark hair, Luke Steele cuts a figure that matches his reputation. Joined by drummer Malcolm Clark, the other surviving member of The Sleepy Jackson, Steele is a genial, if not altogether focused, presence during this interview, which occurred two days after the Melbourne leg of the brief national tour to launch Personality: One Was a Spider, One Was A Bird, the group's long in the making second album. If the show was a muscular riposte to the Perth band's previously questionable live reputation, the record is obviously intended to suggest intimations of greatness. Per his obvious interest in duality, Steele is ambitious yet unconcerned about how his work is received. Most of his answers meet their query at an oblique angle.\n\nLuke: The plan for this tour was to play somewhere that wasn't the norm for bands. With the record being majestic we wanted to get Australia going some more, have shows with a compere and comedians. Australia has the musicians, but we don't take it seriously.\n\nDid you know you were making a majestic record?\n\nLuke: From our last record we went into the '30s and films and everything. I had to write a bit more and I had more control. Last time was harder in a way, but [producer] Jonathan Burnside taught us discipline. But this time we'd paid our dues and we wanted to throw ourselves into the deep end musically and produce it.\n\nHow many tracks did you use on various songs?\n\nLuke: 80 or 90 on some.\n\nMalcolm: All to tape to keep that nice analog feel.\n\nIs that addictive?\n\nLuke: Yes. We were doing pre-production and I was engineering as well, so when these guys went to dinner I'd put down 20 or 30 vocals and that was the starting point. You get used to hearing that, so when we tracked it we had to re-do the vocals, but we doubled the amount and really pushed the boat out. It became a bit of a monster.\n\nWhat does hearing 40 versions of yourself singing together do for your self-perception?\n\nLuke: It's not me. It's not Luke Steele.\n\nMalcolm: His voice is just another instrument.\n\nThe departure of Justin Burford and Rod Aravena for End of Fashion is well documented, but Malcolm why are you the one person still working alongside Luke?\n\nMalcolm: Most of the people who've been in the band haven't had to do it really hard like Luke and I have over the last 10 years. I've been in other bands where you'd tour and three people would rock up to a show gig after gig. We're used to doing it really hard, so that all the things we get now are really cool. They hadn't been through the hardships so when we'd be on tour they'd be saying how hard it was and that there wasn't enough money, but we'd travel around the world, hotels paid for, and just have to play music for an hour. That's the best job ever, but there was always something to complain about. I just don't understand that.\n\n\"God Lead Your Soul\" was the first track written for Personality. Did that set the tone?\n\nLuke: Pretty much. After the Cortez Brothers left it was pretty bizarre. It was like a dream come true for everybody. Lovers sold just enough to establish the band, but we weren't chasing our tails. Then that happened and it was a shock, but it transmitted this record into being a record about truth and the lies and how it got to that point. That's where all the references to The Devil come from. I'm not saying those people belong to that school, but the attributes of that world have corrupted their minds, through drug, through women, through temptation.\n\nHow did you deal with temptation?\n\nLuke: Yeah. We all did.\n\nMalcolm: We went to a really dark place. It happened to me as well. We had to be strong to get through it because there were other people stirring the pot.\n\nLuke: Confusion \u2026\n\nMalcolm: We had a problem with previous management and things that weren't true were being said. We'd read stuff like Luke's sacked everyone \u2013 Luke's never sacked anyone in his life. Justin and Rod wanted to do their own thing and we let them.\n\nWhen you use terms like The Devil is that a reflection of your blues heritage, or a more literal usage?\n\nLuke: It's from the blues. It's from everything. Relationships is the main thing and what's always cut me is that you're playing music, something spiritual, something from your heart \u2013 it's not hairdryer music that blows around when you turn on the switch \u2013 so how someone can demolish that in a second by lying to you makes it pretty evil.\n\nYou lyrical metaphors are quite direct, there's no irony or prevarication or references to contemporary culture in your work.\n\nLuke: I'm at the point where it just needs to be finished once and for all. I got given a lot of mis-interpretated comments at the time. When we play music we're trying to inspire people and show fire and bring new melody. There was so much confusion in the band. We didn't have a companionship with the members. It wasn't a band, just a rolling project. Having been through that we've got stamina. Just went to London and New York on a promo thing, did these shows, and it's the time for us as a band to show what we're made of. It's my time, our time, to be direct and stop the confusion. The whole digital world is going mad, bidding on E-bay and weird people getting rich. People get a song, or they get 20 songs for eight bucks, we got to keep the music strong. Music has to be important \u2013 we're playing at halls to give people entertainment. It's going to happen now because the band's ready.\n\nIs the language of Personality \u2013 the massed tracks, the opulent design \u2013 a way of telling people that it's an important record?\n\nMalcolm: Sort of. We put a lot of stuff in there, but at the same time you can sing along to it.\n\nMy favourite Sleepy Jackson song is \"Sunkids\", which appears to represent an entire compositional path that you've abandoned.\n\nLuke: There are so many paths. A lot of American reviews [of Lovers] tore strips off everything so I was like, \"Cool, I'm going to make a record with a sound that will smack you in the face.\" We've got hundreds of songs, so we did this record and we'll cut another one in March next year. It's the time for us now.\n\nWhat interests you in regards to the band's design? Even your press shots are elaborate constructs.\n\nLuke: I see it as art. If your mug's going to be in a mag better make it look good. It's the influence of Hendrix and Bowie. You can use it as a vehicle. We had a lot of time off and people thought the band was deceased, so we wanted to come back with this massive fire of a fresh start and pump everything and make it crazier, more art.\n\nMalcolm: There were rumours we'd broken up.\n\nLuke: Stories we'd spent too much money selling the records.\n\nDoes that stuff bother you?\n\nLuke: No. [EMI's] been really good, they've shown a lot of faith in the band. We went to America and mixed with Dave Fridmann [The Flaming Lips] and that didn't work out, so we remixed it.

{"text":"Pages\n\nThursday, September 9, 2010\n\n[artistdirect.com] If there's one thing that Blood Into Wine proves, it's that Maynard James Keenan is no slouch.\n\nIn fact, Keenan may have very well replaced James Brown as the hardest working man in show business. Blood Into Wine shows Keenan up-close-and-personal as he and his winemaking cohort Eric Glomski turn grapes to vino over an involved, intensive and intricate process in Northern Arizona.\n\nThe final product, \"Caduceus,\" is the triumphant fruit of all this labor. Keenan unveils it at Silverlake Wine in a revealing, sharp and funny sequence in the middle of the film. Filmmakers Ryan Page and Christopher Pomerenke interview him everywhere \u2014 even the bathroom\u2014making candid conversational vignettes that propel the documentary along at light speed. Ultimately, Blood Into Wine is as poignant and poetic as Keenan's lyrical prose with Tool, A Perfect Circle and Puscifer.\n\nThe film's soundtrack, Sound Into Blood Into Wine, features some unforgettable and unique re-imaginings of Puscifer tracks that'll no doubt stay etched in listeners' psyches. The soundtrack's available now HERE and you can find out more about Blood Into Wine HERE. We're quite positive that James Brown wouldn't want you to miss either\u2026\n\nMaynard James Keenan sat down with ARTISTdirect.com editor and Dolor author Rick Florino for an exclusive interview about Blood Into Wine, Sound Into Blood Into Wine, collaborating with Milla Jovovich, the philosophy behind winemaking and how making wine isn't all that different from creating music in this exclusive interview.\n\nDoes Blood Into Wine exemplify the creative collective idea you've had with Puscifer? It brings the wine, the music and the visuals altogether.\n\nYeah, to be honest, I'm really thankful that they've included so much of the Puscifer stuff in the film. In this day and age, it's definitely a challenge for people to get their heads around what it is. Puscifer's not a band; it's a troupe. We don't have concerts; we have performances. For them to actually give us that much screen time, I was pretty gracious. Being completely independent, we're paying for everything. It's hard to get on the map\u2014especially with the way that the old record industry has worked with its tail and backroom discussions amongst managers, lawyers and agents. We don't have those things.\n\nBlood Into Wine has a maverick aesthetic reminiscent of '70s films with the way the music and film come together. Would you say that's the case?\n\nYeah, I think so. That's a pretty accurate description.\n\nThe music, the philosophy behind winemaking and the journey you embark on converge seamlessly in Blood Into Wine.\n\nNot to get all Buddhist on you, but I think it's got that mentality where these things are not separate events. They're all integrated. When you see Brad Pitt or Kathy Bates doing something on screen, it's such a presented \"thing\" that you think it's one-dimensional and there are no others. You don't ever see them going to the bathroom [Laughs]. They're all integrated. There's more to it. Like you said, I think [the filmmakers] were accurate in connecting the whole life\u2014everything going on around the situations\u2014rather than just showing a slice of the story that you want to present.\n\nDo you feel like making wine and making music follow a similar creative process?\n\nAbsolutely! There's a little outtake on the DVD where Eric talks about Sensualism. Although there have been some negative connotations attached to that Sensualist movement having to do with gluttony and over-indulgence, I think the essence of it is more about you as a conscious being and becoming more conscious as you grow by paying attention to your senses. It's an awakening to those things that you're experiencing in the world. I guess that's where \"artist\" comes in. As an artist, you're paying attention to patterns, noticing things, cataloging movements and recognizing them as a conscious being. Whatever it is\u2014cuisine, painting, music, winemaking, architecture\u2014there are all of these things that you should be paying attention to as a growing artist.\n\nWith complexity of the grapes going from seeds to wine, it mirrors the evolution of a mind given the abundance of intricacies.\n\nI could see that.\n\nIt's an inspiring film because audiences very rarely have the opportunity to see how intense the winemaking process is.\n\nIt's been removed from our culture. Prohibition pretty much interrupted the whole appreciation. It's odd. That was such a huge move. Prohibition, The Great Depression, World War I and II, there's this thing that happened on our soil that removed a lot of that appreciation from the table for us, quite literally. Now, we're catching up with it. There are all of these celebrity chefs and cooking shows. More wine is being appreciated by people and not to the point of indulgence. You don't drive down the highway and see corkscrews and bottles along the side of the road; you see Budweiser cans. It's not like it's that kind of growth. There's an appreciation for art and a consciousness that's attached to it.\n\nThe film's not portraying the classic imagery of Dionysian excess. The artistry comes through with Blood Into Wine.\n\nWe're hoping! The more we can explain that to people, the more they can get on a path themselves and learn some things.\n\nWell, it's done very cleverly. How important is a sense of humor to this film and the soundtrack?\n\nI think you can't really have one without the other. It's very Shakespearean. You have to have the comedy with the tragedy. There has to be the friction with the release. It all has to be present, or it's out of balance. To tell some of these intense stories and see some of these struggles, if you can't tell a joke along the way, it just sounds like a brooding, self-involved documentary. In that case, it might as well be a PBS special.\n\nOn Sound Into Blood Into Wine, \"Sour Grapes Legend\" is truly hilarious.\n\nThat's Puscifer. It's funny, on this soundtrack, people have complained that a bunch of the songs are previously released tracks. At the same time, in the last year or so, I've had people come up to me about those very same tracks and go, \"That song's awesome! Why didn't you release it on the first album?\" I'm like, \"It is on the first album. You didn't listen.\" [Laughs] Also, I can't really sell an album called V Is for Vagina in my tasting room, to be honest. My own sense of humor came back to bite me in the ass on that one. For people who haven't really discovered Puscifer yet, it's a perfect little segue into the dark sense of humor to get into that. A live Puscifer show is a performance. We're a troupe. We're not a band. That night, \"The Legend of the Mix,\" is a whole country set that Puscifer does. There's a whole story that goes with it and all of this video that accompanies it. It's something different.\n\nThese songs feel like they were always open to evolution from their first release on V Is for Vagina.\n\nIt's definitely going to be an evolving project. Most likely, the next thing you'll see from it is a DVD. We're going to probably work on it next year. It'll be Puscifer Season 1 \u2014 Episodes 1-10 or 1-12. It's a show. Some of the shows segue into the others. I guess it has more in common with Adult Swim or Saturday Night Live than it does with Led Zeppelin."}
{"text":"BBC Review\n\nFresh out of school and into the glass-filled sandpit of the real world, Those Dancing Days arrive proffering a much-anticipated debut. A parping fanfare announces the invasion of chirrupy Swedish girl pop - and the weight of frenzied expectation. Their Myspace tracks generated oodles of plays, singles Run Run and Hitten tickled the hype machine - so was the rest worth waiting for?\n\nImmediately spirited away on the swift drum rolls of Falling In Fall, and carrying more than a few of Nina's 99 Red Balloons, it's clear we're headed to a far-off kingdom. It's a land where it's possible to be happy and sad at once, and where early promise doesn't fizzle into disappointment. Run Run is its national anthem - a homage to freedom that feels like pelting down a really, really steep hill before bouncing off into the unknown on a giant drum skin.\n\nThroughout the album, prancing, synth staccato leads the way as Linnea J\u00f6nsson's vocals flutter around - in turns tremulous and forceful but never shrill. Hitten is her sugary flirtation with therapy, a journey to ''make things easier for everyone including me''. Elsewhere, their naivety is played to knowing advantage and Actionman is a delightful, deliberately childlike goodbye to a relationship.\n\nThe tomorrow-never-knows sentiment of Shuffle typifies an art for tender contemplation amidst the hand-claps, but also marks a boundary to their range. While each track is a perfectly-tuned bittersweet blast of youthful exuberance, songs on the latter half - like Kids - suffer from a touch of 'OK, we get it'.\n\nHowever, no sooner does doubt set in than Those Dancing Days takes a hammond organ to the disco and unleashes a glittering track that's a fitting tribute to the quintet. As Space Hero Suits prepares for departure from the kingdom, you're by their side donning the astro helmet. Leaping aboard and rocketing into the orbit of clever pop it's clear that wherever they're going next, it's worth going along for the ride"}
{"text":"These guys have been listening to a little too much Arcade Fire and Modest Mouse, as \"Pax Futura\" often feels like a tribute to a lot of popular indie culture. Of course, this accusation comes despite the lack of listing Arcade Fire or Modest Mouse as influences on the group's MySpace page. Otis Redding my ass!\n\nBut how much can you expect from a band that adopted its name \"from a car accident between Olivia Newton John, and the future prime minister of Rangoon?\" Huh? Did that even happen? Google isn't pulling up anything. But that's not really a surprise by again glancing at the numerous amounts of absurdity infesting Oliver Future's MySpace profile.\n\nThe band's music isn't all bad. They know how to play; they're just posers. \"Happiness Machine\" is catchy, with hip-swaying and sing-a-long goodness and \"Stranger Than Strange\" rekindles the good vibes I would feel from listening to a Sam Roberts record. They're rocking some heavy bass lines and some fuzzy guitar that treads on the style of The White Stripes.\n\nBut while listening to \"Pax Futura\" I had somewhat of a revelation. Not that Oliver Futura is so amazing that it caused any such revelation, but it was more like \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" type of revelation. The third song on the record, \"Signing Off,\" is a general tirade about the insolence of Americans' voting behavior and political education. Usually, I would just write this crap off as another preachy ballad from a bunch of nobodies, who are only paying lip service to such issues, and I hate that sort of thing (unless it's Rage Against the Machine). But I realized that, of the last 20 albums I have listened to, 75% of them have made the same error. It has become apparent that the corrosive environment that is the United States is so ingrained in our skulls, that it has become the second largest cultural zeitgeist behind music today, right behind love and loss. After all, those two are forever and the current situation is not.\n\nSure, you're saying, \"Politics in music? NO WAY!\" But outside of punk rock, politics have always taken a back seat to other such emotional phenomenon. Now that they have become so overbearing, music has actually become an accurate reflection of a mass of people, instead of whatever wacky political agenda the artists may be toting. Not only that, there is also a growing sense of need in personal accountability and maturation, just as \"Sign Off\" suggests. Something that Americans haven't put a lot of stock in over the last two decades and we're all guilty of it. It's not, \"Let's just blame the government anymore.\" It's, \"We need to fix ourselves before we can fix our world.\""}
{"text":"Kindness is easy to love, hard to Google. The fast-rising British artist, aka Adam Bainbridge, makes modern disco-funk with irresistible pop hooks, including his new single \"That's Alright.\" The song introduces itself with a languid saxophone solo before kicking off into a genuine stomper, with Bainbridge stepping back to let female vocalists take the spotlight. Over the next four minutes, somber and jubilant elements are blended to make a song not quickly forgotten. The B-side to \"That's Alright\" is a live rendition of the song, recorded at BBC Radio 1's Maida Vale studios. It's a drier, punchier take that pushes the bassline up front."}
{"text":"Interview #266: Mystery Jets\n\nSun, 2008-03-09 11:50\n\nOne of the less orthodox bands spawned by the post-Libertines London music scene, the Mystery Jets started at the end of the last century when Blaine Harrison and his dad, Henry, formed a band together. Soon joined by Blaine's schoolfriends Kai and Will, the band recruited drummer Kapil and started staging gigs in a crumbling hotel ballroom on Eel Pie Island. A new scene rapidly grew up around the Eel Pie shows, giving artists like Jamie T an opportunity to play their first gigs.\n\nAfter two years on a world tour and another year in the studio, their new album, Twenty One is out March 24th and sees the Mystery Jets spread their wings in style.\n\nI Like Music caught up with Kai from the Mystery Jets to talk about the new album and single, working with Erol Alkan and meeting Flea at Fuji Rock.\n\n''I Like Music because\u2026 music makes me smile.\" Kai, Mystery Jets\n\nILM: Young Love is out on 10th March. . Please describe the track and its whole vibe?\n\nKai: It's a track that I wrote with Will. We wrote it at the beginning of last year. It had been a couple of other songs and then it became a new version on it. I don't think we had any particular thought before starting to write it. It was just coming up with this slightly Motown loopy bass line and it just went from there. We wrote it an afternoon, we sat down and by the evening it was done: all the vocal parts and the lyrics. It was one of those really fortunate songs.\n\nSome songs can come together like that in a few hours and some songs can take months and months. It was so final that when we went to re-record it we used all the backing vocals that we'd done in my bedroom as the actual backing vocals on the track, because we wouldn't have done it better in the studio. So it was really fortunate.\n\nILM: It's kind of a very Spring time track I think and it features Laura Marling, how did that collaboration come about?\n\nKai: The idea of getting a girl singing on it came from the lyrics we'd written. We wanted to write something really fresh and not think about it too much. We just sat down and came up with some ideas and some lines and then after we'd written that first verse and the chorus and it was in writing the second verse we thought it'd be great to have the other side of things. We had the boys' perspective, wouldn't it be great to have the boys' perspective, just to shake it up and also it's something we'd never done, to get someone to guest on a track and to have a girls' voice.\n\nWe didn't know who to ask to sing it. As we were writing it we thought it'd be great to have a girls voice and then during the recording process, we thought lets try Laura out. We played a gig with her at a little gig down Elephant and Castle and she was really cool and she had a really lovely voice and quite a unique voice; you couldn't pin it to a London scene or whatever. There's something quite folky in one sense but she carries a lot of weight when she sings. So we tried it out and it fit really well and everyone was really happy with it.\n\nILM: You write harmony driven, edgy indie pop. Please describe the Mystery Jets music making process. Lyrics first or melody or random?\n\nKai: Most of the time there's some kind of music there which is generally written on the guitar, so one of us will have some chords or an idea with a melody on top of it and it'll work from there. Some tracks like Hideaway, it's the first track on the album and people have picked up on it live, and it's the only electro sounding thing on the album. That was written from a bassline and the drum beat and then everything else got written afterwards.\n\nIf it's more Blaine's song he'll often have the lyrics the melody and the guitar line and then bring it to the band and we'll chop up the structure and give it a different vibe in places. Will and I wrote a lot together on our second album, so we'd do a lot more with the music and arrangement and some melodies and then Blaine might come after and put down some lyrics. So it's quite open but it's definitely found its feet a lot more in terms of the songwriting process compared to the first album, which was a bit shambolic.\n\nILM: Twenty One is out on March 24h.Which track did you enjoy laying down the most and why?\n\nKai: That's a good question. A track which was great to record is Flakes. Its just live, what you hear is just what we played, it wasn't tracked or anything. We were just together in a room with the lights down really low and it was midnight Erol probably lit some incense or something and we played it a few times and picked the best take out. To record a song in that way, live and you're all vibing off each other, it's great. It's asking a lot more of you because everyone has to get it right all together. Other songs are built up more. We recorded every song in a slightly different way depending on what the song needed.\n\nILM: Twenty One sees Erol Alkan in the production seat - his first complete album. What did you learn from the almighty Erol?\n\nKai: He's the biggest music lover I've ever met. He's a DJ but he's so much more. Some DJs just do the dance stuff and aren't into bands, whereas he's like the other way round. He grew up with that Britpop period and he adores music, all sorts of it. He's got a room in his house that's just records filling a whole room, every wall of it. It's amazing, like a history of music. We'll be working on a track and he'll say this really reminds me of this band and he'll talk about them, so there was a real education.\n\nAs a band we really like to know about music and Uncover new things and older stuff as well. But compared to him, we're a good few years behind. In the studio, he's a lot different to your standard producer, because he's not had much experience of being in the production seat and that's given him a real freshness to it. He felt like one of the band, it felt just like another musician there rather than a producer, which made it sometimes really hard and, other times, really incredible. He's now a great friend of ours as well as someone who's done an amazing job with production and I've certainly learned a lot from him.\n\nILM: Erol 'Music Library' Alkan we shall now refer to him as.\n\nKai: Yeah, definitely.\n\nILM: You recently played London Astoria with CSS, and London Electrowerkz plus an iTunes Festival one. How was the Astoria gig?\n\nKai: It was great. We were really excited before it. Walking out on London Astoria stage is always good. We played there a while ago with The Futureheads. It's such a great venue, it's the perfect size, there are enough people to feel like a big event but also with 2000 people it's got an intimacy there. I really like that size venue. When you move to places like Brixton it's vast.\n\nWhen you're playing a support gig you never know how many of your fans will be in the audience until you step out on stage, but it was great. There were hardcore pockets of Mystery Jets fans scattered around the audience and, even people who weren't our fans, I think they really enjoyed it. And just to be out gigging again after recording all of last year and learning how to play all these new songs as a four piece. We've got a different stage set up so the whole thing is quite different, and that's something we felt was important to move it on for the second album, so we're just learning how to do that.\n\nILM: How come Henry is no longer in the line-up?\n\nKai: It happened quite naturally in the period between the first and second album. In one sense we wanted to go and do something the four of us. And for Blaine, the album is all about 21, that age between youth and adulthood and those discoveries you make and finding your own feet. It would be strange if that was what the album was about and yet he's still playing in a band with his dad.\n\nBut he's still very much there writing and still part of the band as much as he's ever been. But also with the live thing\u2026 he's a busy architect as well. He has got a lot of young energy, but with this second album, it just seemed the right way to go. I don't think he wanted another few years of gigging and touring.\n\nILM: What's the craziest thing that's happened to you on tour so far in your career?\n\nKai: Fuji Rock, which we played in 2006 (and we're going back this year); that was incredible. I remember standing on the stage watching Yeah Yeah Yeahs, standing next to Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I was really drunk and I was like, 'Flea\u2026. How you doin'? Alright man?' And he was there with the bass round his neck, warming up with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, so that was surreal seeing this living legend. The whole of Fuji Rock was a bit like that.\n\nILM: You've followed your dreams. What advice would you give to young people on following their dreams to get the career they want for themselves?\n\nKai: The problem is a lot of people haven't yet found what they want to do. I think once you have an idea what you're passionate about and what you're naturally good at. Everyone has something they can naturally do; everyone has something that they're naturally inclined towards, whether it's helping people or listening to people or instruments or languages or whatever\u2026 once you've got a good sense about what you're passionate about you've got to do it. A lot of people haven't found that yet. Maybe that's because they haven't tried enough things.\n\nIf you go away and travel for six months and fall in love with something\u2026 that's a good idea. If you don't know what you want to do traveling can be great. If you do know what you want to do, you've got to start doing it. If it's a creative job it might work differently to something you need to go and get a degree in, but finding like minded people and working with others, because I don't think you can't do anything on your own in this world. So finding others who share that passion and doing it with people who are on the same wavelength and then it's going to develop and grow.\n\nILM: If you weren't a musician, what would your second career choice have been\/what would you be doing if you weren't a musician?\n\nKai: I had this kind of sixth sense from a young age of about 10 years old or so that I'd be doing something involving music or film. That was just how it was going to happen. So if I wasn't making music, I'd probably be making films. I still try and do as much film stuff as I can in the little bits of spare time that we have, and I'll never stop doing that.\n\nI had quite a lot of involvement in our music videos at the beginning, but it's not the same as making films, it's not as satisfying. And also it's good to keep things apart so the band thing is the band thing and the film thing is something else. But I made our very first music video which was pretty crazy"}

{"text":"Tools\n\nThe pedal steel guitar is music's accent mark: In country, it sighs and moans, matching a singer's despair with notes that hang in empty, desolate space. Or it can shoot up in quick little licks, dousing a bucolic beat in flammable spirits. In rock, it's a gilding texture, filling space with a tone that's less blunt than an organ and more nuanced than a six-string's predictable moves. The well-played pedal steel is often sterling, rarely the star.\n\nTyranny is more of a surefooted first step than an innovative introductory leap. Subtly arranged and exquisitely played, it proves that this quartet has both the skills and the smarts to push steel-led instrumentals beyond curio status. Elkins' lines are as memorable as they are elegant: \"Daylight Dies\" sits coolly in the distance, for instance, its lean melody as comfortable surrounded by a glow of electronics as it is gliding through Donohoe's late-arriving beat. Alternately, \"Crispy Hexagons\" is wiry and anxious, Elkins' steel canvassing Donohoe's manipulated drums and a keyboard's icy washes with mercurial variations.\n\nThough there's nothing wrong with these 47 minutes (perfectly enjoyable, without qualification), the presiding placidity makes for a listen that feels a tad circumscribed. You want Starmount to push the driving parts harder or to dive deeper into their drift (which they do on the pharmaceutical closer \"Bud\"). Perhaps those noise bursts on \"The Battle of Brentwood Creek\" could fight a bit more vigorously, or perhaps \"The Constable\" could capitalize a bit more selfishly on the climax that slips past its grasp. Or perhaps Starmount could just make another record, since, on their debut, muted and subtle wonders intrigue so often."}

{"text":"Bloc Party, 'Four' \u2013 Album Review\n\nIt's just a shame. It could be worse, of course. You don't have to be a cynical muso to anticipate for a band to be a bit uninspired after a four-year hiatus. It's expected, right?\n\nIt would be silly to expect another 'Silent Alarm' from the band who, let's face it, has been getting more and more disposable with each new album. 'A Weekend in the City,' Bloc Party's sophomore album, and 'Intimacy,' their third, represented two gradually worse creative crap-outs for the band.\n\nBut something about 'Four' just seems more than disappointing. At times it seems downright disdainful, like going out to dinner with an old friend you haven't seen in years and them not even making so much as an attempt to be engaging. Just going through the automatic motions, expecting you not to notice and not caring whether or not you do notice.\n\n'Silent Alarm' represents the best, most fully realized album of the early '00s Brit boom. It still sounds great and relevant seven years after its release. But 'Four' barely stands up under its own 43-minute running time.\n\nAnd the legs that support the album \u2014 those brief bursts of music which make your head tilt a bit and give you a bit of hope that the album may just be a delayed grower \u2014 those legs are usually just, ahem, liberally borrowed from other songs.\n\nSurely the band isn't trying to hide the fact that the hook of their new single, 'Octopus,' is lifted directly right out of a certain song about diseased rabbits from 'Hail to the Thief.'\n\n'V.A.L.I.S.' might as well directly sample '1901\u2032 by Phoenix. 'Real Talk' is a pretty good Blur song. And we're not the only ones who heard the riff from the opening track, 'So He Begins to Lie,' and double checked to make sure we didn't slip in a wandering 311 CD.\n\nDuring the times where Bloc Party does sound like Bloc Party, it's so weighted down by post-punk sprechgesang cliche that you can't wait for the band to get back to sounding like Muse again.\n\nSo, yeah, it's just a shame. 'Four' is just a formless mess, half-baked at best and seemingly thrown together last minute.\n\nThere was once a Charlie Rose interview with David Foster Wallace where they dismiss a movie as being \"so bad it doesn't even have charm.\" There you go. 'Four' is just that. It's an album so tepid and bland it doesn't leave so much as an aftertaste"}

{"text":"'Interventions + Lullabies,' The Format\n\nAs far as teenage pop music goes, there isn't a whole lot that can transcend and speak to older age groups. Characterized in recent years by elementary chords, immature lyrics and male singers still waiting for a voice change, the whole category of music sells out from the get-go. Teen pop seems to just produce and reproduce the terrible music of bands before them (see: Blink 182, A Simple Plan, Sum 41).\n\nThough they're few and far between, it's always refreshing to find that there are youngsters out there producing reasonably intelligent and thoughtful music. The Format is groundbreaking within its genre, but the duo still has a long way to go before it can cater to a wider audience.\n\nTheir debut is a page ripped from the journal of a teenage boy -- or at least it seems to be. Nate Ruess and Sam Means have vocals similar to Ben Folds, but with the immaturity of Ben Kweller. They couple their ballad-like songs with synthesizers, drum machines and acoustic guitars, unfortunately emerging with an awkward, unpolished product.\n\nThe first single, aptly named \"The First Single,\" is hardly representative of the rest of Interventions and Lullabies (Elektra). It's an excitable, drive-with-the-windows-down song, with Ruess and Means practically laughing out the lyrics.\n\nBut the happiness stops there. The rest of the album takes on the attitude of a spoiled teenager wanting to run away from home. While it's OK to vent those feelings through a few songs, the Format makes the mistake of singing about their angst on every single song on the album. It gets old fast, and I spent the rest of the time listening to how many times the words \"leave,\" \"leaving,\" \"gone\" or \"alone\" popped up on the album.\n\nWhile I commend the band for exploring new instrumental combinations, they often cram too much into one song. On \"Tune Out,\" the duo starts the song off slow, creating a nice conversational tone with the listener. But it's completely ruined when the song lurches into a hyper chorus and hammered-out chords. It's like striking up a nice conversation with someone, then suddenly yelling at them and sprinting away in mid-sentence.\n\nThe Format has a fair grasp on how to create decent music, but they don't really get past musical adolescence here."}
{"text":"Introducing Matthew De Zoete\n\nYou know when you play a song for a friend that you think will blow them away and they have a face like you've just farted at their close friends funeral? It's disappointing isn't it. But then again, that special something that clicked with you may get completely overlooked by them.\n\n'Colour Film', the d\u00e9but album by Matthew De Zoete is a personal record that has moments of absolute beauty and thoughtful musicianship. It is one to listen to privately.\n\nIt's observant words could be as immortal as Simon and Garfunkel or as modern as Sufjan Stevens' mini-epics. The reason for it's open minded nature is the production it went through. Rural Ontario native De Zoete wrote quickly and expressively on a, acoustic guitar before experimenting with sounds and textures with his band and producer Les Cooper to make something very unique and spontanious.\n\nSongs like \"Mexico The Free\" and the title track \"Colour Film\" combine reverberated country and folk with modern pop and synth sounds which give it a certain poignancy that you can only get in the 80\u2032s chorus' from artists like Annie Lennox.\n\nThis isn't an album only of interesting little ballads though, tracks like \"Who Do You Think You Are\" is a punk track that has been renovated into an avant garde, harmonising classic, keeping its backbone and simplicity but adding layers of atmosphere to complete it's meaning.\n\nThe great thing about this album is really how simple it is. There aren't sounds or styles of which sound out of place or that smother the songwriting but at the same time, the backdrops that the music is painted on are rich in creativity and style.\n\nThe opening track \"The Good Life\" is a great introduction to the album and evidence that Matthew De Zoete's d\u00e9but is emotive and open to where the creativity takes him. This is one to listen to at midnight, by yourself and as loud as you can.\n\nShare this:\n\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, June 5th, 2012 at 5:35 am"}
{"text":"3OH!3 - Want\n\nEmerging stars of the horrifically named crunk-pop genre...\n\nIf you're yet to come across 3OH!3, they're the emerging stars of the horrifically named crunk-pop genre and 'Want' is their second album proper. The Boulder, Colorado, two-piece make tunes that mix the best (and some of the worst) elements of hip-hop, pop and punk with surprisingly pleasing results. The summer anthem 'Don't Trust Me' may be the strongest track here, but there's a thumping energy in 'Holler Til You Pass Out' and 'I'm Not Your Boyfriend Baby' that we cant deny. There's a fair amount of filler on 'Want', but when 3OH!3 get it right, they're a dance party in their own right."}
{"text":"Angels in America play the most fascinating music. They also have an obsession with potato chips. We met them a little before they gig in Athens and we coaxed out of them their second interview. Ever.\n\nAngels in America is one of the most fascinating new lo-fi bands in the US. Their music build a unique atmosphere, drawing many elements from trip-hop. When Thurston Moore first listened to their demo, he immediately signed them to Ecstatic Peace! They are coming to Greece as special guests of the party for the tenth anniversary of the fanzine\/indie label Phase!Records. We catched up with Lingerie Jack and Iked-Out Jezebel right before their trip to Thessaloniki and talked about their brand new names, their addiction to potato chips \u2013which in their opinion are the main indicators of cultural differces between countries- and Georges Moustaki. This is their second interview. Ever!!\n\nWhen did you start the band and why?\nLingerie Jack: In 2007.\nIked-Out Jezebel: We were living together and it was winter time and we were kind of bored.\n\nWhat kind of music were you listening then?\nLJ: A lot of different styles. Nothing specific.\nIJ: There wasn't something specific ever.\nLJ: What we could do with what we had. We had a guitar and effects. That dictated it more than anything specific.\n\nWere you always involved in music?\nLJ: This was the first real, real thing\nIJ: I always went to shows but more punk shows and stuff like but I wasn't in bands like in a serious way and even this when it started it wasn't like serious.\nLJ: It was something to do like recording and we didn't worry about it and how it would be like and we didn't care if anyone would like it. It didn't matter.\n\nWhere were you living at the time?\nIJ: In Montreal, Canada.\n\nWhere is your base now?\nLJ: We live all over.\nIJ: We don't really live anywhere now. It's kinda up in the air right now.\nLJ: It's hard to say where the band is from or where is located. That's why there's a lot of different information out there that says where we live.\nIJ: Every time we play a show they say that we are from a different place and we haven't lived there for a year.\n\nHow would you describe the music that you are playing?\nLJ: I think the best way to describe it is as just what happens when we are together. It's like an experience of a private thing.\nIJ: And a sort of mixture of surprise. We don't really think in terms of genre.\n\nDo you improvise on stage?\nLJ: Not usually. Sometimes\nIJ: It's different, what we do. We don't do improvisation in a normal way like when I'm singing and a lot of the times I sing differently. The way that I perform on stage is always different and that part is more impro but the instrumentation isn't.\n\nHow did you choose the name of the band?\nLJ: Not from the TV series. It's just a name.\nIJ: I don't remember actually. We had a joke about it but I don't know what it was.\nLJ: It can be anything but there is a space there.\nIJ: It's kind really meaningless in a way that is good.\nLJ: Most people know that there is a show or a play but it doesn't really matter what our intentions were.\n\nTell me a little bit about your European tour. Was it the first time you are playing in Europe? How was it?\nLJ: Yeah! First time playing in Europe.\nIJ: It's been really good.\nLJ: It's really nice to try all these food and snacks and watch movies but also see these places.\n\nWhat's the best thing you ate in Europe so far?\n\nIJ: Besides what we ate today [traditional Greek food]. I went crazy about a Belgian waffle that we've had.\n\nLJ: We tried to see if they had a waffling eating contest so we could be in but no one knew what we were talking about. Some potato chips in Italy were pretty interesting. I don't know if they were the best but they were exciting.\n\nIJ: We had these potato chips called virtual. Pretty like sci-fi.\n\nLJ: They were sci-fi chips. They were three dimensional. They were like cones. But it was more about the hunt. We wanted to track them down. They were more important than music for a couple of days.\n\nIJ: We heard about them and then we looked for them in every store we went to for three days. And finally in midnight the night we were leaving, we found them at Auto-Grill.\n\nLJ: They are visually beautiful and taste beautiful as well. We found them outside of Milan, that's where the magic event took place.\n\nWhich artist would you like to collaborate with and why?\n\nLJ: I would only really like to collaborate with dead artists or the friends that we have now and they are available I would really like that. But, if it's like a dream or something that would be really amazing.\n\nIJ: Probably we would like to collaborate with an historical figure like Abraham Lincoln.\n\nLJ: Or like a Greek one too. Wait, like George Moustaki, my dad really likes him.\n\nIJ: Or Neil Diamond!\n\nI think Georges Moustaki is still alive.\n\n-Oh yes! So, we can still do it.\n\nSo what about your next plans?\nLJ: It's not really an Angels in America release but it's in the angels verse. It's called Angels USA VH1 Drunk but it's like a radio play. So, it's a recorded story with music and characters and we do all the voices except from one.\nIJ:There is one guest appearance from a collaborator friend. A friend that we have never met actually.\nLJ: But he's a true friend. He sent us a transmission and we included it in the story. It's going to disappoint everyone who wants a music album but it might be good anyway. It's the most ambitious thing we've ever done.\n\nWhat's the story about?\nLJ: It actually ties everything that we were talking about before. It's about the world getting really excited.\nIJ: It's about a new invention that the people would like to purchase. It's being installed in their mind by surgery. When it's implanted in your mind you can download flavors into your mouth while you eat chips. So, there's an unlimited flavors of chips that you can eat.\nLJ: So there are commercials for the different chip flavors, like jingles. We wrote a lot of songs for the different flavors. They're really good.\nIJ: Weirdly we recorded that and then our life kind of became like that.\nLJ: Because we found about the virtual chips and all these different chips but that was after. Immediately it just took over our actual reality. So that's how you know it's an important work for us. It's invaded our lives.\n\nDo you want anything else to add?\nLJ: We don't really have good stuff to say about music. We can say our new names.\nIJ: Yeah, we have new names. It's Lingerie Jack and Iked-Out Jezebel"}
{"text":"Big Awesome is a young three-piece rock (indie\/emo) band from Bluffton, SC. This song is the single from their new EP, which is also titled Birdfeeder. This track caught my attention because on first listen I knew nothing about the band. The intro bass line sounded like The Breeders and then the drums kicked in like Shellac. Then, finally, the guitar and vocals kicked in exposing what the rest of the EP sounds like, which is basically 90s emo. This generation will liken them to Algernon Cadwallader, while older folks like myself would link them to Cap'n Jazz or American Football. In any case, I enjoy the energy of this song and the places it took me. Birdfeeder is out now and was self-released by the band."}
{"text":"Tom Waits' newest album, Bad As Me,\n\nTake moment of twangy banjo and sax, the REAL horns come in with a blast. The drums start shuffling, and Waits comes in with a bluesy growl in his voice. The lyrics are bluesy, too, all about leavin' home and moving to the big city of Chicago.\n\nA few tracks later, the song \"Get Lost\" comes on with a clap and thud. Remember how I said this album was everything but Rock & Roll? This track is the exception. However, the \"Roll\" is necessary for accuracy; this song brings to mind early 50\u2032s-style rockabilly, with a fast beat and lots of jazzy playing. Tom's lyrics could be sung just as easily by a teen with slicked back hair wearing a biker jacket, and that's how they're written. This song screams of teenagers' hormones, and how Tom just wants to run off and \"get lost\" with his girlfriend. It's easy to forget the guy singing this is 63, there's so much energy.\n\nOf course, the whole album isn't just potent blues and jazz songs; there are a few beautiful ballads, like \"Pay Me.\" A mournful reflection on the trials of touring as a musician, this song shows that Waits has been tried and pushed to the limits by his career touring. This is a song about the pain and exhaustion that comes with touring, and how it ends up being unsatisfying. \"They pay me not to come home,\" he sings, and their money keeps him on the road until he's nearly finished. Musically, \"Pay Me\" is quite diverse; a finger-picked Spanish guitar leads the melody for most of the song, with an accordion and violin holding the harmony in the distance. At the end, a piano comes in and takes over his vocals with a few twists and turns. It has to be twisty to match his vocals, because otherwise there's no way a piano could match the contours and inflections of his voice on this track.\n\nThere's one track, \"Hell Broke Luce,\" that's just terrifying. It's a song about war, and how horrifying it gets for those on the front lines. The tribal-sounding drums, distorted bass riffs (as played by Flea from RHCP), and growling, demonic vocals add up to create something extremely unsettling. The lyrics also contribute to the uneasy feeling, with some disturbing imagery painted out for the listener. However, the song keeps bringing me back to listen again and again. It's just another example of Waits' ability to play any style, and to play it well.\n\nDirectly preceding \"Hell Broke Luce\" is the song \"Last Leaf,\" coming in with surprising beauty. It's a ballad, with Tom reflecting on how he's managed to survive this long when so many of his peers haven't. What makes it noteworthy is that Keith Richards plays guitar and sings backing vocals on this track, someone who certainly knows what the song is about. Both Waits and Richards have been playing music and abusing their bodies for a long, long time, but are still alive and surviving. Now it's their duty to introduce new artists to the job, and their influence on culture is beginning to show \u2013 something I imagine would be slightly unsettling to someone who's still alive to see it. This song sums their feelings up nicely, and feels very modest \u2013 almost like a confession.\n\nOverall, this album is an eclectic and exciting collection of all the things that have influenced today's music. Each track is drastically different, but somehow they manage to sit with each other nicely. When I listen to Bad As Me, I feel like I'm listening to a timeless Classic Album: one that music snobs and casual listeners alike keep hearing about, like Dylan's Blood On The Tracks or something by Miles Davis. When I read about music like that, I get an idea of what such a Classic Album should sound like. When I put on Bad As Me, I hear that quality in it. I know it's (mostly) not Rock & Roll, but I like it"}
{"text":"No related\n\nOf all the neo-flower children strumming acoustic guitars and lumped together under the \"freak-folk\" banner, Alela Diane might be the most grounded. Sure, her warbly alto twang is a tad on the theatrical side, but she marries it to full-bodied folk arrangements of a decidedly retro nature, more closely resembling outfits like Pentangle and Fairport Convention, which roamed stages 40 years ago, than contemporaries like Joanna Newsom (a childhood friend) and Devendra Banhart. Prior to her performance at the 7th St. Entry on Wednesday, Nov. 18, Diane talked with The A.V. Club about her musical dad, small-town roots, and why her fans shouldn't be too surprised if she ends up chucking her music career to be a log-cabin mother.\n\nThe A.V. Club: Much has been made of the fact that you and Joanna Newsom both hail from the same small town\u2014Nevada City, California, population 3,000. How did Nevada City shape your artistic perspective?\n\nAD: Growing up in a town like Nevada City definitely opens the gateway in terms of pursuing a life in art and provides a very nourishing creative environment. A lot of that has to do with the fact that there's not a lot going on. As a kid I would be out in the yard building fairy houses with walnut shells. [Laughs.] We entertained ourselves by doing things off the beaten path, and there was a lot of open space in which to do it. It also helped that our school had really good art and music programs. All of the kids were encouraged to be creative. Even just the setting was inspiring, being surrounded by pine trees and rivers. It's much more inspiring to me than urban and suburban places.\n\nAVC: Living in Portland now and touring cities most of the year is probably quite a change of pace.\n\nAD: I think about this almost every day now, just because of all of the touring. Today was a perfect example\u2014just spending most of the day stuck in traffic. To be honest, being in cities every day is not the way I ever imagined I would be living my life. All of the experiences I've been inspired by and written about, those things aren't really happening in my life right now, and that worries me. To be sure there are moments of beauty here and there but being on the road is mostly just draining. For that reason I've already decided I'm going to take about six months off at the end of this tour to just try to become a regular human being again. All of that has pretty much fallen by the wayside the last couple of years, which definitely has me concerned\u2014not just in terms of being grounded as a person but also creatively. If I'm going to be an artistic person, I also need to have the time and space to actually live.\n\nAVC: You can always tell when songwriters have spent too much time on the road. Their new songs all end up being about what it's like to be a performer.\n\nAD: That's so true. Touring constantly disconnects you from the people who are listening because all of the sudden you're writing about things they don't understand. These days artists aren't really given the proper time and space to be creative. I'm going to demand it because if I keep working this hard on the road I won't have the space to make the music and I'll end up quitting altogether and having children that I'll raise out in the remote wilderness. Those are my more extreme thoughts on tough days. [Laughs.]\n\nAVC: Your lyrics mix imagery of nature and everyday rural experiences with elements that are more dreamlike. How do your songs reflect your real life?\n\nAlela Diane: Almost all of my songs start with a tangible story based on something specific that really happened. The songs still have a dreamlike aspect to them, because my dreams are really tied in with my reality. I also write a lot about stories passed down from my mom about people in our family's past. That's my way of pursuing fantasy rooted in something real. Reality and fantasy in my songwriting are always recklessly intertwined.\n\nAVC: So far your father, Tom Menig, has been your most consistent musical partner, producing both of your records and playing lead guitar in your band on most tours. Is it ever awkward having your dad in the band?\n\nAD: It's really all I've ever known, and over the course of time it's just become so obvious that the partnership works that I wouldn't ever want to change it. My dad is an amazing guitar player and I don't think I could find someone who is both as talented and easygoing as he is. He's easy to travel with and always has a positive attitude, and ultimately that's really more important the musical side of things. When you're on tour, it's togetherness pretty much all day every day so things like being able to get along become the most important thing pretty quickly.\n\nAVC: Is it fair to say your parents are your biggest musical influence?\n\nAD: Definitely. Growing up with musical parents, the only music I really heard as a child came directly from them. They liked to sit around and play together; my mom would sing old bluegrass tunes and my dad would play guitar. We didn't have a big record collection, because at any given moment my dad would have a guitar in his hands so that would be the sound you heard. I'm sure my mom sang while she was pregnant with me so I think a preference for simpler, more traditional music was instilled in the womb."}

I was sensing that a lot of what was in pop music was very perfect\nand manufactured\u2014not manufactured but room\u2014everything is in its place sonically\nand in time. This record is messy. It's a little bit gritty. We brought in Holy\nF*ck and Shad\u2026 to bring in beats that would dirty it. I thought naturally I\nprogress towards pop and soft melodies, so the combination of two different\nthings could make that even better.\"\n\nTCEC: \"Where\nthere any events or people that really influenced your writing on this album?\n\nLights: \"The\nwhole vibe of the record was a bit of a struggle to get to\u2026 like figuring that\npart out because I've never made a second record before, obviously. And by\ntalking to a lot of people, it's a complicated thing. 'Cause suddenly you have\nexpectations of how your music is supposed to sound\u2026 You can do whatever you\nwant. It's tough because even you have expectations of what you want to bring\nto your fans and suddenly you really have to shed everything, reinvent yourself\nas an artist, and pretend this is the first time the world is hearing you. So I\nwas struggling to find a place\u2026 I began listening to a lot darker electronic\nstuff like Crystal Castles and went to a DJ in Montreal and it was all Dubstep.\nI was really enjoying some of the elements of Dubstep, which is really a\ncombination of a lot of stuff about music I love. It's got like metal\nbreakdowns, slow hip-hop, and electro. I thought, 'this is such a cool\ncombination; it's so gnarly.' It's heavy but simple\u2026 I call it a download\nmoment; I figured out that was what I needed to do on this record, so that was\na big one for sure. Then I had a conversation with my manager, who has been\nworking with me for ten years and has been on the same level. I was telling him\nabout the new way I wanted to go with this record\u2026 he's like 'why don't you try\nsomething else?'

It was one of the\nfirst songs written for the record. It was written before that download moment\nso we actually ended up re-recording it later, but it was the transitional\nplace between the first record and the newest record in terms of content. The\nfirst record was kind of sad, ironically sounding a lot happier that it should.\nThis one's a little darker, but it's a really happy record. 'Toes' is one of\nthe first songs, along with 'My Boots,' which is a one-off single, that I just\nwanted to write something light, about something that just makes you happy. 'Toes'\nis just about a situation or a person that is so influential in your life, no\nmatter what is going on around you, you could be going through something crazy,\nand that is ironically, what is keeping you on your toes.

I mean there are\noften times when, if you make a great video, it enhances the song\u2026 I had a song\ncalled 'Second Go;' it wasn't my favorite song on the record, my first record,\nbut once we made the video for it, it happened to be one of my favorite videos\never.\"\n\nTCEC: \"Your\nwebsite is very interactive.

Obviously you don't understand irony and I have taught you nothing. 2. Let me throw some names at you: The Shins. DeVotchKa. Regina Spektor. The Weepies. Mumford & Sons. Explosions in the Sky.

Or Disney films, rather.\n\nromanticized concepts\n\nThis mix is about wandering.\n\nWhy It's Pretentious: I'm spending most of my Valentine's Day on a plane. LA to Denver to Nashville. I always thought planes were strangely romantic, probably because every film from Casablanca to Love Actually has a plane scene, or because for a few hours, you're getting a glimpse into the lives of complete strangers. I always wonder who people are, where they're going, if they're meeting someone or coming home. The possibilities.\n\nThis mix is called romanticized concepts, for short. Although it's named after a Woodpigeon song, it's actually based on Quadron's \"Tone\" and Elizabeth & the Catapult's \"Everybody Knows,\" two of the most sultry songs in existence. I originally wanted to make a playlist consisting of sparse pop songs, but it sounded too empty, so it evolved into a mix of wandering atmospheric (and often electronic) pop. Lots of sighs and strange instruments, repetitive beats and sprawling melodies. I think I was actually going on a winter flight at the time, so it's very fitting. Very good for watching landscapes change and drifting through clouds. It's maybe not the most traditional Valentine's Day mix, but there's a lot of love in it, in a lot of different ways, and I think that's enough."}

{"text":"Dividing his time between Down and Corrosion of Conformity, guitarist Pepper Keenan has little time for anything else, save a few causes that are dear to his heart. With Down back in the studio and preparing for a sold-out tour of South America \u2014 where he plans to \"hit the streets and shop!\" \u2014 Keenan is solely focused on making music with his guitar partner, Kirk Windstein, bassist Pat Bruders, drummer Jimmy Bower and vocalist Philip Anselmo.\n\nShortly before taking the stage in Texas during a recent string of Down dates, Keenan called to talk about the band's upcoming EP series and share his uncensored opinions about the music industry, the state \u2014 as in environmental state \u2014 of Louisiana, and the real meaning of tone.\n\nHow has your relationship with Kirk grown and how do you continue challenging each other?\n\nWe know each other's playing styles and we're pretty different guitar players. Kirk is more finesse-oriented and I'm more ham-fisted, pretty much of a hammer, downpicking kind of thing, so we play off of those things. I'll come up with a riff and Kirk will come up with a melody or harmony behind it or on top of it. As we've gotten older, playing guitar together, we use it as a starting point where the songs launch. Kirk comes up with riffs all the time. There's no leader; we're more focused on the song, the end product, rather than the sum of its parts. In the studio, generally I'll do the rhythm tracks first. Kirk goes after me and we double things that way. On this particular new stuff, we want to do Kirk in one speaker and me in the other speaker and try it super old school, like the NOLA record was. Whatever it takes to make the song do its thing. What we hear in our heads is what the end product is going to be.\n\nDoes he ever surprise you by taking a song in a different direction?\n\nNo, not necessarily. Sometimes we've come up with pretty cool stuff, like \"Ghosts Along the Mississippi\" and things like that. The song is never done until it's gone to the mastering plant. Sometimes Phil does something that gives me a whole new idea, and I'll go back and change the riff after he's already put the vocals down \u2014 either get out of the way more or let it breathe more once I've seen what he's done.\n\nOver the course of twenty years, have you ever come close to calling it a day, especially with the current state of the industry?\n\nI don't know. I'm so underground that I'm oblivious to it. I don't Facebook, I don't do any of that s--t, so I just keep trucking along for the love of playing music, and in the Down world I can't really notice a difference. I think people appreciate a real band like us. I don't think we've been as affected as some other bands because we have a loyal following and we're true to them and we expand. Each time we come through there's younger kids at the shows because I think they're tired of the bulls--t too. They want to see something real and they know they can rely on a band like Down. I think that's helped us out. It's probably hurt some bands that weren't in it for the real reasons, but the ones who really enjoy what they do and have a love of music are the ones who remain unscathed because they're not affected by something like that. But the fly-by-night bands who are trying to make something stick to the wall by networking or whatever the f--k you do, put s--t on the Internet and just rely on that instead of getting in the f---ing van and starving to death for the love of your music, that's the ones who say the industry sucks!"}

{"text":"Posts Tagged 'Isobel Sollenberger'\n\nLovingly pinched from Soundblab: I missed a chance to see Bardo Pond live recently and I've got to say listening to 'Fallen', their side of this split release with fellow psychedelic troubadours Carlton Melton, doesn't help. An incredible, sprawling, 20-minute monolith that reaches those deep down, psychedelic regions that Jefferson Airplane just can't reach anymore.\n\nThis is dense, disorientating music; thick with drones, fucked guitars, flutes (yep, flutes) and distant, spacey vocals from front woman Isobel Sollenberger. The vocals don't appear until about 15 minutes into the track, so don't go expecting any sort of recognisable song structure. Bardo Pond make roaming, immersive and trance-inducing pieces that could quite happily go on for hours. It's an intense and all-consuming ride through the noise-rock underground and one I can't recommend enough.\n\nAs Bardo Pond's track gradually subsides it's followed by the equally epic Carlton Melton piece, 'Slow Growth'. The track fades in with slowly building electronics and a dusty, wind-swept drone; the title couldn't be more apt. At once soothing and mildly unnerving, Carlton Melton make music for your mind. It's around the five-minute mark that crunching, doom-rock indebted guitars come in, perfectly balanced with the rather pretty instrumentation now going on in the background. If I were to draw comparisons I'd say there's something of the Vibracathedral Orchestra's hypnotic, circling majesty in 'Slow Growth'."}

Unconventionally-named band members Yelle, GrandMarnier, and Tepr make up the popular French band and consistently create incredible pop music that skews dance and electro. It's virtually impossible to listen to their music without swaying your hips and flailing every single one of your limbs. Their beats are irresistible.\n\nMy skills in the French language are considerably lacking, which allows me to ignore the actual lyrical content and focus on how hardcore I'm dancing. Previous online research has led to the discovery that Yelle's lyrics are RIDICULOUSLY dirty and provocative\u2026I have no issues with that.\n\nAfter the release of their 2007 debut Pop Up, the band fell off the radar for a bit. Their widespread popularity throughout Europe was accompanied by a notable following in America, but it faded as several years passed with no new music. FINALLY they've released their second album, Safari Disco Club, and it lives up to everything I could have hoped for. Here's the double-music video they released last month for the album's first two tracks, \"Safari Disco Club\" and \"Que veux-tu.\" It's highly amusing and beautiful and colorful and amazing.\n\nYelle plays Royale Boston on April 29th, which I'm ridiculously excited for.

{"text":"music, politics, art, Elvis apologism\n\nI had a blast at 3 Clubs last night, drinking tons of liquor and watching scores of rawkers do America-themed covers, some of them solo on them there acoustic-type instruments, as part of the Christof Certik curated \"1st Annual Preindependence Day Musical Extravaganza\". Whilst Darren Grealish's anti-Bush tune and Sara Melson's folk sing-alongs inspired a lot of hoots and hollers, by far the best portion of the night was when Winter Flowers (just a trio this time\u2013Astrid, Gavin, and Christof) got on stage with a banjo and did a cover of Schoolhouse Rock's \"Preamble!\"\n\nTheir performance was so amazing, I woke up in my car at six in the morning in a Hollywood parking lot!\n\nI took a lot of flak from certain friends and girlfriends of mine, for my suggestion yesterday that Winter Flowers' \"reach exceeds their grasp.\"\n\nI want to go on record and say that Winter Flowers is one of my favorite groups in Los Angeles. Their concept alone, of bringing back the elven folk of gentle people in the spirit of Pentangle, has always wowed me. I've seen them several times throughout the years, as they slowly evolved from a longhaired duo with mandolins to adding a glockenspiel, getting a girl singer, and plugging in some guitars and keys and things. Their songs are awesome, I'm glad they have a strong, clean male vocal in the lead, and when they mix up a little rock into their medieval pudding bree, it has a Dionysian boogie that sounds wonderfully reminiscent of the experiments going on with early Fairport Convention, the Byrds, Donovan, or Roy Harper, without ripping off any of these greats.\n\nBut here's the caveat. While musically and conceptually they may be great, vocally they just do NOT have the chops to pull this thing off like it needs pulling off. I mean, listen to this vocal of them performing at Houdini's castle:\n\nThe song starts off pretty damn good. But notice that when the group vocals come in, they warble in and out of pitch? There's no way else to say it\u2013these guys are not together at all, and this is fairly consistent with how they sound every time I see them.\n\nTheir vocal execution can only be compared to the musical execution of W.A.C.O. a couple years back\u2013an orchestra just sounds like bad band class rehearsal when they squawk along with tinny brass and flat oboes. And a small folk choir sounds like amateur hipsters when they can't get the harmony buzz going demanded by their medium.\n\nBack in the real folk sixties, people were doing spot-on four and five part harmonies in their sleep. Listen to something like Soft Sounds for Gentle People, and you never ONCE hear a group of people committing things to record that they could not fully pull off. I know, from being in bands and trying to harmonize, that it's very, very difficult to be good at singing with people you didn't grow up singing with for years. But then again, I also would never get up with a horn and try to blow like Charlie Parker. By committing themselves to the folk ideal (and playing on bills with flawless singers such as the Chapin Sisters), Winter Flowers are stretching themselves past their talents and exposing their own shortcomings. They need to spend a little more time in a room together, singing and listening, until they get it right."}
{"text":"After OK Go performs on 'The Tonight Show With Conan O'Brien' on Friday, Jan. 8, the band will jet off to the UK to launch a European tour on Jan. 11, the very day the Chicago power pop quartet's latest album, 'Of the Blue Colour of the Sky,' is released there. Singer Damian Kulash tells Spinner that the record, which is released in the US one day later, was deeply influenced by heavy touring, which caused him to take stock of his song writing.\n\n\"We toured for 31 months without stopping,\" he says. \"I came home and tried to write a big blammo chord. Like, turn the amp to 11 and write a big power chord that tears your scalp off. The thrill of that after 700 days of shows in a row didn't do much. I was like, well, that's boring.\"\n\n'Of the Blue Colour,' which doesn't sacrifice OK Go's characteristic bristling hooks, also reflects personal and worldwide gloom, he says. \"We were all going through a tough time personally and globally. Firstly, the presidential campaign, the chaos. Then the recession. The world seemed so f---ed.\"\n\n\"It's a very dark record,\" Kulash continues. \"It is more introspective feeling, but that also comes from the way we made it -- sort of from the ground up rather than the top down. Ten years ago, I sat down and said 'Why doesn't the world make stadium rock anymore?' So, I wrote a song like that. Now, I can't work that way.\"\n\nIn short, Kulash was power-chorded out. \"Having expended that particular thrust, we sort of got back to how we listen to music, rather than how we learned to make it. There are a lot of '80s Prince influences on this record. You can almost hear exactly what I was listening to when I was 12 years old. There's a little bit of jangly on-the-porch Led Zeppelin, a bit of spacey electro Depeche Mode and there's a lot of Prince's 'Purple Rain'.\""}
{"text":"Between the unexpected Jawbox and Black Star reunions, the Yacht Rock superjam, and the Roots subbing as the best backing band in late night (see: Elvis Costello, Monsters Of Folk, Paul Simon, the Lonely Island, Zach Morris), Jimmy Fallon's music department's did everything right in '09 to vault from newcomer to reigning king of late night music. But what cemented Late Night's status had less to do with gimmick than with consistently daring booking. And Jimmy started 2010 right last night with Japandroids \u2014 the exuberant and punky garage-pop duo that's probably sold less albums than Fallon's studio holds people \u2014 giving a relatively underexposed band a shot at winning some fans that don't read blogs or have the legs for CMJ. The Canadians brought \"Wet Hair,\" a song they Dropped on us last summer, punning in tandem on Bikini Kill and french kissing. When we first heard it the weather matched the wordplay; last night was likely on par with the Vancouver chill they suffered while writing it. So, a jam for all seasons:\n\nthis is a decent song for a 12 year old that just got his first guitar, learned three chords, and came up with three lyric lines with his friends that he thinks are witty.\nprops to fallon for bookin little indies but as far as the music on this one goes- ehhh\n\nJapandroids are passionate musicians; this song is a fun one and they rocked it. Yes, their lyrics are simple and their songs aren't too complex, but they're making music that they love to play and (some) people love to hear. Jimmy is indeed daring to host these guys, I just wish he would let those people standing behind them dance like they should at a real Japandroids show.\n\nYou should check out music where the artists actually have talent, you may dig it.\nDon't worry about what poseur friends\/bloggies\/urban outfitter salespeople tell you- trust me when I say technical musical ability and original creativity can still be cool.\n\nhi uhhhh\u2026.i'm 17\u2026.read pitchfork daily\u2026.uhhh\u2026\u2026my fav bands are japandroids and the pains of being pure at heart and cymbals eat guitars. japandroids are just so emotional you know? french kissing some french girls\u2026..they rock so hard\u2026.\n\nHey there\u2026 my name is dane\u2026 I am too hip for pitchfork and music in general\u2026 so instead i come on to this blog and troll people who only got into animal collective after MPP was released\u2026 I like own Spirit They're Gone before anyone like knew about them\u2026\np.s. I am on match.com under the name Dane LennonByrneWilsonLennoxCoxOberstSmithRingo\n\nall it takes is a guitar effects pedal or two and that suspended chord he's playing\u2026obtainable by any talentless hack with relatively functioning fingers.\ni don't think the stab at urban outfitters was to say there's something wrong with music snobber, but more that there's something wrong with music snobbery based on hype and fashion over real musical talent and content.\n\nThe performance wasn't terrible, it just wasn't anything interesting or impressive to me. It is a fact that the song is very simple in construction, requires little skill to play, and the lyrics are very elementary. That's not an opinion, it's like stating that playing tic tac toe is very simple in structure, requires little skill to play, etc. No big deal, the song and performance are just not that impressive.\nBlogs like this exist so that people can comment on posts\u2026so it's ridiculous that you're suprised people have negative things to say and assuming that it's the same person posting them just because your feelings are hurt is also absurd.\n\nYou're right it is absurd, so why are you doing it? There's so many things you said just now that just gave you away, crazy troll.\nTo me, it was the fact that you start new paragraphs like this. And then you go on blathering about \"SKILLZ\". Fuck off. Those are two guys making better music than full lineup bands. They aren't dfa 1979, but I like them. Its the sound I enjoy, and even if its talentless, simple chord progression that a child could play, they gave a great performance. I like garage rock, I like the simplicity. Go masturbate to Van Halen douchebag.\n\nIt's fine for what it is but you guys getting bent out of shape over the criticism are taking it too seriously. Normally I'm fine with \"just go with it\" fun time music. But this was annoying to me. The lyrics are not witty, I'm sorry. As for technical proficiency. . . so what. It all depends on what you're going for. They're not trying to impress anyone (obvs) and guess what? I'm not impressed. I'd rather see Times New Viking but hey, good for Japandroids. btw- can bands stop with the Japan puns please? Japandroids, Japanther, Japancakes. That's enough already!\n\nYes, exactly. Japandroids are great to see live because they get so into it and their songs are just lively and fun. I like them a lot, but I also like bands that are more \"serious\" or complex. I don't understand what about them could possibly make people so offended and hostile unless they're the kind of person who hates any band that happens to gain some commercial notice.\n\nThis band is great \u2014 definitely a record for the summer though. And since when is it requisite for punk (indie punk or otherwise) to have complex chord progressions or labyrinthine lyrics? It looks like you're looking for something that is distinctly at odds with the tenets of this genre.\n\n\"these guys are out there having fun\"\n\"they are great to see live because they get so into it\"\n\"making music because they want to and playing things they might like to play and do fun stuff\"\n\nGreat points, kids! All it takes to make good music is having some fun and getting into it. Nevermind having real originality, technique, vision, skill, and all those other annoying things that are ruining today's popular music.\n\nbands like japandroids annoy me. don't get me started on beat happening, or those television personalities. THEY MAKE MY BLOOD BOIL. brb guys, I need to calm down and listen to some dragonforce; those guys know how to play their stuff.\n\nHave you ever thought that it takes some balls to play punk. to stand out in front of everyone and give it all you got. The songs may be short but that's the point of punk. It's short and to the point, and say what you want however you want. Hasn't anyone ever listened to how goofy some ramones lyrics are, but they those songs are still great.\n\nthe balls it takes to play punk?! that's pretty funny. being a clown for kids' parties takes about the same amount of balls and they're both pretty fucking lame. i'd love to hear what makes punk more \"brave\" than say, getting in front of the same amount of people and playing some completely different music while \"giving it all you got\"\u2026\n\nThey are a band that bears watching. Their record is pretty nice \u2014 Wet Hair is the simplest song, to be sure. But to bash them because on one song last night they didn't display technical proficiency to your satisfaction last night is to bash the Ramones and Costello and the Pistols and dozens of other great bands that found that you didn't have to be Jimmy Page or Eric Clapton to advance music (and Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton agree with me, btw).\n\nI think Japandroids are a decent band but putting them in the same sentence as the Ramones and Costello is a joke. Costello is so versatile and wrote so many original and intricate songs.\nYes, the Ramones and the Pistols played short, simple punk songs but they innovated and had a lot more character and raw heart put into it. There's not much original about Japandroids, but they're fun enough.\n\nWhat did the Ramones innovate? They shamelessly pilfered from '50s pop music, '60s gargage, and early '70s proto-punk like the Dictators and MC5, and they even acknowledged it. Joey Ramone admitted half of what the band did was image and hype. That's what half of fucking rock n' roll is: image and hype.\n\nSeriously though, sometimes you want fillet mignon and sometimes you just want a greasy burger. Unless your vegan, at which point I don't know how to make an apt comparison you can relate to.\n\nThe technical proficiency dude probably has 30 different versions of the same Phish song on his iPod and is just now exploring indie rock because he's only been listening to one band since he was 15 and smoked pot for the first time. Now it's 15 years later and his 17 year old Pitchfork reading cousin was like \"Dude, Wilco has guitar solos too, you need to branch out\" at Christmas dinner and so he downloaded Sky Blue Sky and now all of a sudden he has opinions to share on a blog.\n\nMy friends who are into \"technical proficiency\" as a condition for quality in music? The ones who wear their suits from their work day to go see Widespread Panic more than one night in a row? The ones who basically dig Trey Anastasio for the same reasons they dig Lebron James or Roger Federer or Tony Hawk (alpha-male domination via technical prowess and virtuosity)? I don't even try to turn them on to music. Most closed-minded \"music fans\" on the planet.\n\nsounds like you think the only bands out there with proficiency are jambands\u2026that's stupid. i won't even get into how bizarre and off the mark that alpha male comment you made was\u2026yikes\n\nalso- the proficiency dude that brought up dragonforce was probably being sarcastic and you missed it. i think he's on your side, dude. everyone knows dragonforce blows.\n\nno one said japandroids need guitar solos or techincal proficiency to be good, they just need some redeeming quality to justify the hype and tv spot. ya know, besides being a sloppy two piece band that sings mediocre power chord songs with three lyrics.\n\nRockin out and proficiency are not mutally exclusive btw- Ever watch footage of Jimi Hendrix? Dude was off his nut freaking out bu It was amazingly skillful. Also Man Man are amazing musicians that are also total goofballs on stage. Don't get me wrong I love a one note guitar solo (Neil Young). There's room for the whole range of amateurish to virtuoso. Both can totally loose their shit and rock out. So pointing out that Jdroids are a bit lame doesn't make you a snob or a hater, it just makes you someone that prefers something with a little more to chew on.\n\nIt looks like all the Superfandroids that are getting bent out of shape are missing the point. I'm pretty sure Needsmoarchords that brought up \"proficiency\" was being satirical\/sarcastic whatever. And the people before him commenting negatively on the performance weren't saying that you need profiency to make good music\u2026they were just saying this performance wasn't great. I think the point is that you should have some unique vision, technique, and or skills of some kind to create good music and not just some blah shit that will come and go.\nLook at bands a band like Radiohead- I can't think of a song of theirs that takes \"proficiency\" to play but it took some real talent to creat them. How about one another personal favorite- Pavement? They sucked at their instruments when they started and their songs aren't hard to play but they have a vision and real creative originality. Those bands are special, along with many others. I can't recall any other Japandroid songs so I'm not judging them overall but this song posted here is pretty unspecial. Don't be angry.\n\nFor real Steph, you need to go back and listen more closely to both Radiohead and Pavement. I know this isn't really the core of the discussion here but your examples of bands that are lacking in technical ability are just profoundly incorrect.\n\nI didn't mean Radiohead songs are easy to play and I didn't say they're \"lacking in technical ability\", they take a ton of ability to play. I just mean you don't have to be a PROFICIENT guitar, key, drum, bass, player to perform the songs, necessarily. And when I say \"proficient\" i mean it as \"Expert\", like a techincal pro. I'm not a stellar guitar player but was able to play (and figure out) most Radiohead songs by the time I was in college\u2026I'm no pro. The point is that Thom and co. have a ton more going for them and what they create\/write is spectacular. They don't need to be shredding guitar gods because they have so much more going on.\nSame thing with Pavement. I'm sorry but if you think their songs are hard to learn\/play, you don't know much about musical instruments. Does that matter? No, they have so much more going on and the genius behind the writing is key. It's raw, noisy, and loose\u2026great shit. That's why they're as iconic as they are so many years after they were releasing music. I doubt anyone will be talking about Japandroids next year. Best of luck to them, though.Sorry for the long post, didn't want to be misunderstood.\n\nI see nothing interesting or new here. A two person band is a big statement, and usually only super talented mega stars pull it off unless you're a guy\/girl combo act. In this case, I don't see the talent that DFA, or the White Stripes, or Black Keys possess \/ ed. They have some personality. That's always good, but the music seems a bit contrived.\n\nIts funny to see the extent to which people will try to degrade a band just because they don't like them. How about you go and argue about things like politics where something can be argued about. People like the music and the techniques of how its played aren't going to change how it sounds to them. If what entertain's me doesn't entertain you then be a little more considerate and shut your mouth. Music is an abstract art it only exists in the time its played and listened to, so you can analyze it all you want but it mostly depends on how it sounds to the individual while they are listening to it.\n\nBob Seger says simple is good, but Japandroids is just okay. Reminds me of some of them them bands I saw in Katmandu. But whatever, man, good luck to them. I am happy for them kids that can remember their phrases enough to repeat em. Ted Nugent is a badass. You guys should check him out.\n\nI used to have the 'Cat Scratch Fever' LP. It went well with my Black Oak Arkansas, Johnny Winter and Charlie Daniels Band LPs.

I'm not buying it.\nI don't care for this band at all but don't think that all of the people that love them are ignorant and\/or stupid.

Too bad that people think certain bands are products of blog hype, personally I enjoyed this record immensely long before pitchfork and stereogum sunk it's teeth in.

Or, \"art\" and not \"kitsch.\"\n\nI dont think the lyics are aimed at 12 year olds, actually. i feel like this is more of a nostalgic sort of band\u2026 they're good with evoking memory through a simple sound and set-up. The entire album is kind of that way. And no, I don't read Pitchfork, NME, and honestly don't read stereogum all that often.\n\nAlso, people claim Buckethead is technically proficient, but have you heard any of his solo work? BORING. AS. HELL.\n\nI lol'd at some of these comments.

{"text":"Dusted Reviews\n\nTimeless, in all senses\n\nMythology has a strange power to reinvent itself constantly. Its characters are broadly drawn archetypes and its dramatic action takes place in a sort of pre-anything non-time, and it's exactly this formlessness that allows stories older than written history to stay relevant each time humanity burns another temporal bridge. It's also very likely why M. Ward's music is enchanting in such an inexplicable way: his third (or fourth) full-length, Transfiguration of Vincent, doesn't seem to belong to any particular time. The lyrics teem with kittens and killer whales, lovelorn fools and dying heroes, the instrumentation sounds neither modern nor overly antiquated, and lord knows the songs themselves could have been around for generations.\n\nThe first thing you hear is crickets. To the extent that you can imagine M. Ward sitting at a campfire somewhere in the middle of the eternal summer night, staring down at his guitar and ignoring everything else, they offer the perfect introduction, as does the rest of \"Transfiguration #1.\" The first of a few thematic instrumentals, it acts as the album's exposition, previewing each native element one by one \u2013 the neatly picked guitar, a hint of organ, whispered drums, harmonica, barroom piano \u2013 but it's not until the first proper song, \"Vincent O'Brien,\" that the introduction concludes with Ward's inscription: \"He only sings when he's sad \/ And he's sad all the time \/ So he sings the whole night through \/ Yeah, he sings in the daytime too.\"\n\nAs Transfiguration continues, it settles into an innocent, soulful meander, trading shades of quiet now and then without ever rising much above a whisper. The difference between the slow melancholy of \"Undertaker\" and \"Involuntary\" and the restrained excitement on \"Helicopter\" is usually the instrumentation; at his simplest, Ward says enough with only the guitar and his throaty croon, but the well-placed bout of faint organ or rudimentary drumming helps to create the occasional moment of low-key frenzy. Now and then some of the sparser songs recall the earliest of Ward's fellow Portland native Elliott Smith (especially on interludes like \"Duet for Guitars #3\"), while the dry, windblown sound of California friends Giant Sand and Grandaddy appears in the fuzzy distortion of \"Outta My Head.\" Though the most specific reference to geography is \"I am somewhere in the city,\" the west coast influence is at least palpable.\n\nBut even if you can nearly tell where it's all from, Ward never lets on when. If anything, Transfiguration is more old than new; you might swear that \"Sad, Sad Song\" and \"Dead Man\" (just to name two) were word-of-mouth folk spirituals \u2013 considering ever-repeated couplets like \"Dead man, dead man, don't cry \/ When you die it ain't the end \/ It ain't the end when you die\". What you have here is the exact opposite of a period piece: it's new but it feels old, it's here but it's nowhere, it's now but it's forever. Whatever, wherever, and whenever it is, though, it's lovely."}

Alexander Lewis seems keen to maintain a low profile, but A Luminous Veil is one of the most striking debuts in the field of industrial electronics we've heard in some time. Supposedly created using only synth, microphone and pedals, and apparently recorded in one take with minimal computer processing or post-production, it's a varied set from start to finish; opener \"The Third Room\" and \"Figure Moving\" both sound like synthesized power metal, while \"Mirror Fragment\" creates a foreboding drone landscape; \"She Demands Attention\" meanwhile places what sounds like a short wave radio monologue amidst squalling guitar feedback. With shades of the material coming from Dominick Fernow's Hospital Productions and the more extreme ends of Editions Mego, A Luminous Veil is essential listening.\n\nReview:\nPerhaps the most minimal Spectrum Spools release to date, The Sincere Interruption is Eric Lanham's first release under his own name after several ears of performing as Carl Calm and Palmetto Moon Electronic Group. Recalling the precision of early 00s Mille Plateaux and Raster-Noton, The Sincere Interruption clicks with glitches that sound like scrambled MP3 fragments, albeit held together with an invisible matrix beneath.

{"text":"Here's a question I hadn't really considered until just now: Does TV on the Radio constitute a supergroup? There's some obvious evidence to the contrary, specifically that none of its members were famous before the band. And the term \"supergroup\" is so loaded that it shouldn't be applied liberally. But all of its members have robust solo careers\u2014since 2008's Dear Science,Kyp Malone and Dave Sitek each released solo albums. Even more illustrative, though, is how each member seems to refer to the band in interviews: Malone, Sitek, and Tunde Adebimpe seem continuously shocked that they are still together, as if TV on the Radio werea side project that kept growing.\n\nThis week's release of Nine Types of Light should make fans very happy that the band is still together. Despite the broad tastes and styles of the band's members, TVOTR hasdeveloped a coherent sound that is uniquely itsown, which its memberswould be unable to match without one another. Indeed, the band's different sounds have blended together so well that I often can't eventell who is singing on a particular song.\n\nOn past albums, the multitude of styles that TVOTR comprises has led to songs that tend to change on a dime\u2014like \"King Eternal\"\u2014or that tend tosound frenetic, like a lot of songs being played at once\u2014like \"Dancing Choose.\" Nine Types of Light, on the other hand, has a more relaxed, deliberate sound. The differences are clear from the very beginning. \"Second Song,\" the first song on the album,* begins slowly, with just Adebimpe's voice over a lone note, before adding a crisp, simple drumbeat.

{"text":"Share\n\nReview\n\nBarely a year after Amos released \"Strange Little Girls\", her first attempt at creating a conceptual album, Amos released her sixth studio album, \"Scarlet's Walk\". Just as it happened with \"Strange Little Girls\", \"Scarlet's Walk\" presented us with another attempt at crafting an album around a concept, in this case the main idea being the story of an alter-ego of the songwriter, called Scarlet, who went on a road trip around the United States and along the way found herself learning about life and about herself.\n\nClich\u00e9d as the concept might sound, \"Scarlet's Walk\" is actually the one album by Amos where the concept that drives it truly shines, and where it becomes actually easy to understand it, allowing the listener to comprehend the voyage Scarlet goes through and empathize with her along the way. The proper reason for this is hard to find, maybe it is because the concept is much less abstract than the concepts she touches in her other albums, or maybe because Amos indeed went through an US trip while she composed and wrote the lyrics for the album. In either case, this is Amos' strongest conceptual work, and one of her best musical productions to date.\n\nAlbum review\n\n\"Scarlet's Walk\" actually has one of the slowest, less characteristic openers of Amos' discography; that being the sweet, yet somehow not too memorable \"Amber Waves\". It isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, considering that a book rarely ever starts the story with the most interesting part, instead most stories starting up slowly, with the first chapter usually being the hardest to get through, with it being barely a set up for the rest. That's pretty much how I believe the whole of \"Scarlet's Walk\" should be seen, like a book, a whole story told by songs instead of written chapters.\n\nOnce the opening song is done, the listener is thrown straight into Scarlet's adventure, with the beautiful \"A Sorta Fairytale\", which actually sets the stage for the rest of the album, which contains a pretty big set of different musical styles, all of which seem to blend together just fine under the general theme of the album.\n\nMusically, this is one of Amos' most varied albums, since there isn't a musical base set through it \u2013 There is a small part of the arrangements and writing of the songs that keeps them tied together as a piece of work, but besides that each song is its own world, and no genre seems to repeat itself over. This is an album where each song has an identity and that is actually what keeps the album up and what makes Scarlet's story so interesting overall. If there's a musical genre that actually rules all over the album, it would have to be the shades of country and folk music that can be found on many songs \u2013 None of them can be properly considered either of the genres, but there are shades of them in most of the songs, something that's pretty understandable considering the album is telling us about a voyage through the US.\n\nLyrically, the album keeps up with the music. Just as every song is a world of its own musically its own, each song tells its own story, which can be looked upon either separately or together \u2013 All of the songs in here work just fine both ways, and no song depends on the storytelling of the album to shine, there are no proper interludes (Although if you had to choose a song as one it'd be \"Wapum Prayer\"), and even lyrically the songs are independent. The themes touched here range wildly too, showing how the lyrics of the album tells us more about Scarlet's thoughts than what physically happens through the album. Some of the songs where the lyrics shine the most are \"A Sorta Fairytale\", which is also one of Amos' best known songs, \"Strange\", an unusual breakup song and \"I Can't See New York\", a song loosely based in the events of 9\/11 (It is said its based directly in it, but Amos has repeatedly stated she had already been working on the song by when 9\/11 happened, and that even when it affected the song greatly, a part of it existed long before then), which is possibly Amos' most haunting song ever, sporting a strong piano, changes in the tempo of the instruments and extremely deep lyrics that, no matter what Amos might say, do seem to refer to 9\/11 almost directly (\"Thirteen thousand and counting, swallowed in the purring of an engine\", \"But I can't see New York, as I'm circling down through white clouds, falling out\", \"In the end all we have; soul blueprint\u2026 But did we get lost in it? Do we conduct a search for this?\").\n\nAll things said, I believe \"Scarlet's Walk\" to be a true masterpiece, and one of the two albums I believe anyone who wants to know at least a bit about Amos has to go through \u2013 Where \"Little Earthquakes\" proves she craft timeless songs that manage to enthrall you twenty years later, \"Scarlet's Walk\" manages to show any audience why Amos has, and should keep on working around concepts, since out of all her conceptual albums (That being anything since \"Strange Little Girls\", since \"Abnormally Attracted to Sin\", though not presented as a conceptual album, does manage to pull out a particular atmosphere where the album may as well have been a story told through the eyes of a 1930s mother intersected with the same story through the eyes of a 2000's mother, much like what was done on film with \"The Hours\").\n\nFinal review rating: 5\/5\n\nAvailability: The album is currently available on physical and digital form from Amazon.com\n\nBuy Physical Album"}

{"text":"After being forced to turn to south Michigan Avenue for salvation, thousands of festivalgoers slowly filed back into Grant Park post-Apocapalooza. With the two-hour jump in lineup serving as a healthy intermission, the Tallest Man on Earth was put to the test of inaugurating Saturday's second act.\n\nBut as Kristian Matsson put on a brave face and an air of optimism for his set, the crowd was audibly restless, still feeding off the evacuation-induced adrenaline rush. With a reassuring calm, Matsson graciously thanked the audience repeatedly for taking the time to listen. While those in the front showed the necessary reverence for his well-crafted folk, the masses continued to loudly exchange tales of their brush with the apocalypse. But Matsson played on, strumming the hell out of his guitar and delivering that heartfelt croon he's known for. He played a healthy mix of songs from his much-loved EP The Wild Hunt and newer songs from this summer's There's No Leaving Now, but it wasn't until he unleashed the instantly recognizable \"King of Spain\" that the crowd united in enthusiastic clapping. While singer-songwriters don't always register as exciting, Matsson kept things earnest and upbeat, providing a great segue into the remainder of the day."}
{"text":"Cult indie band Yo La Tengo has been around since 1984, and even if you haven't necessarily heard a song of theirs before, you kind of have. Yo La Tengo is often referred to as the \"quintessential critics' band\" and has paved the way for all indie pop\/rock bands to follow. Their wide range of sound and use of lo-fi to violins is their staple that is the groundwork for so many bands today.\n\nThrough their 13 albums the band has bounced around and experimented, some albums more successful than others. I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One, their eighth album, is home of the song Autumn Sweater and is what I will always like to remember Yo La Tengo as being. Autumn Sweater is perfectly chilled, and is one of those songs that can transform any moment to make you feel you are in the triumphant closing scene of a feel-good movie.\n\nBut don't get used to the sound. If I didn't know any better and I listened to Autumn Sweater, then a song such as Ohm off the new album, I at first wouldn't think it was the same band. But, after a closer listen, the subtle details tucked into each song create a consistent thread that makes all the separate songs seem not so different after all.\n\nEach song on Fade has a soft hum, or muddled drone, layered in, especially Two Trains. The lo-fi vibes mixed with acoustic guitar gives Yo La Tengo the likeable haziness that keeps the listener at ease; perfect for studying when it is best to fill the mind with easy sounds.\n\nThe meadowy guitars and flowery, gentle vocals are pleasant, nothing to rave about, but there is nothing to criticize either. This band, named after a baseball anecdote about players yelling, \"I've got it!\" in the outfield, is a legend and an example of a strong and steady force. I mean, not many bands can say they've lasted 30 years. If you find yourself needing to relax and release some stress, this band's good energy is contagious and will get you feeling serene, like everything will somehow work out and be okay in the end."}

{"text":"El-P\n\n(April 2007)\n\nInterview by Adam McKibbin\n\nHopefully, El-P will be a gateway drug for rap haters (hot topic on the Metacritic forum this week: \"Does rap suck or what?\"). The 32-year-old rapper has been distracted from his own music in recent years by his other gig: running Definitive Jux, one of the most-trusted names in underground hip-hop (Aesop Rock, Cannibal Ox, Murs). With I'll Sleep When You're Dead, he makes a triumphant return, sounding like he's been bottling up a lot of shit for the years since 2002's Fantastic Damage, and now he's ready to unload. He's a dominant personality, but also a team player\u2014the record is well-served by verses by Aesop Rock and Cage, as well as appearances by hip-hop staples like Cat Power, Trent Reznor, The Mars Volta, and Yo La Tengo's James McNew.\n\nAs El-P explains in this candid interview with The Red Alert, he set out to make an album documenting the human condition in modern times. The result is an inspired whirlwind of emotion and narrative, built on reliably premium beats and a Dennis Miller-like barrage of referenced pop culture and current events. There are some laughs, too, as when he asks for (and receives) The Dramatic Intro Machine on \"Smithereens (Stop Cryin).\" Mostly, though, I'll Sleep When You're Dead hits hard and lingers long, as on the brilliantly dense and bruising \"Tasmanian Pain Coaster,\" the fiery, anti-war declaration of \"Dear Sirs\" and the dystopian fiction of \"Habeas Corpus (Draconian Love).\"\n\nHow hard is it to strike the balance between artist and businessman? Is it unavoidable that the captain has to sacrifice personally, artistically speaking, for the good of the crew?\n\nYeah, I think it is. It's a different type of artistic existence. Somewhere along the line it stopped being all about me. Most artists exist in a world where it really is all about them all the time. That's just not the way it is for me\u2014but that's something I've grown to love. I like the selflessness of being involved with other people. But, yeah, I've had to push my career, to a degree, to the side in order to work with those other people. That's a choice. At the same time, you know, it's become part of my existence, and I can't imagine another way. I am incredibly excited to be doing my music again.\n\nDoes it affect your ability to be a fan, too? Even as a journalist, I find that it's pretty rare that I'm doing completely no-strings-attached listening anymore.\n\nYeah, you know, people always ask me \"What are you listening to right now? What's your Top Five of the month?\" It's like, \"Dude, I don't fucking know.\" (laughs) Once you've involved in the industry, it changes. You have an insider perspective\u2014you're a part of the machinery, to a degree, and it's much harder to see it from the outside. One of the things I look forward to is touring, because that's when I do my most hardcore music listening. That's when I get to zone out and be a fan again, because you've got hours and hours of driving and I'll just sit there and listen to my iPod for eight hours.\n\nDo you burn out on music altogether sometimes?\n\nUm\u2026sure, sure. No doubt. And I burn out on myself, definitely. But then I stop and I fucking splash some water on my face and I try to remember that this isn't that serious. This is something to enjoy and love, and it's a ridiculous gift to be involved in this.\n\nI think when you get to a point where you're involved in something that centers around the creative\u2014whether you're a professional journalist who covers it or a musician involved in it\u2014if you get to the point where you're not even open to being moved anymore, then maybe you should stop. You're not doing anyone any fucking good\u2014and you're just punishing yourself, because there's nothing more painful than being involved with something you used to love, but don't anymore. It's kind of like hanging out with your ex-girlfriend. (laughs) You know? Move on. That's kind of my attitude about it. There are a lot of journalists, even, who need to move the fuck on, and there damn sure are a lot of musicians. If I ever get to a point where I get that jaded or exhausted or am taking it all for granted, I just try to get inspired again, you know?\n\nI spend a lot of time bouncing between progressive political circles and indie\/underground music circles\u2014and there's a lot of bitching in both of those worlds that nobody is writing any protest music anymore, nobody is plugged in to all the things that are going on, and so forth. Obviously they haven't heard a track like \"Dear Sirs.\" Do you think, though, that there aren't enough musicians stepping up to that plate, or is that misguided criticism?\n\nFirst of all, hip-hop is the only form of music that people are ever mad at for not being political. For some reason, rock music can completely exist outside of the pantheon of anything that's happening at any given time.\n\nBut I think punk rock falls into that category with hip-hop, too, though.\n\nWell, the criticism that gets leveled at hip-hop from all directions is that we're not supposed to take ourselves too seriously, but, at the same time, we're supposed to say serious things. We're not supposed to be violent, but we're not supposed to be soft\u2014because if you listen to emo hip-hop, then that means you're emo. We're not supposed to be political, because if we're political, then we're the \"political rapper.\" (laughs)\n\nTo me, my answer to the whole thing is \"Fuck all of you.\" I'm just one fucking man, trudging through the muck and mire of everyday existence. I have no intention of writing political records, but if my job is the eloquent translation of the human experience and I have half a brain about me and I'm taking in my surroundings, you're going to hear that in my music regardless of whether you consider me a political rapper\u2014you're going to hear it in a love story. My inspiration is these times, and that's the canvas I paint everything on.\n\nIn this record, what I wanted to do was if there were politics, they had to come from the personal, and not from some bullshit geopolitical perspective that I have. Who needs to hear about that from me? I really don't think that anybody needs to hear that El-P thinks that George Bush is an asshole. (laughs) I think it's pedantic and annoying when people stand on a pedestal. What I would rather do is eloquently document the psychological state of someone who is alive right now. If you can listen to that and take something from it without it being shoved into your face, then I'm doing my job. If we're not tuned into whatever it is\u2014love, pain, frustration, joy\u2014if we're not putting these things in our music, then we're not doing our job.\n\nBut I don't think that the burden is naturally put on any genre of music to be political. I think the burden should be to matter. If we're making music that doesn't even matter to us, then we may as well be put up against the wall when the revolution starts and shot in the back of the head because we're a fucking waste of resources, a bunch of assholes who walk around and don't have jobs, you know what I mean? Our only job, the only thing anyone is asking is to think a little bit more about your existence, think a little bit more about the experiences you're having, take a little bit more time to say something beautiful so you can translate it for us because we don't have the fucking time. You know? That's the only burden I feel.\n\nIt's interesting, too, because when these people talk about the good old days when people were making protest music or whatever, they often mention people who didn't even see themselves as political artists, like Bob Dylan. I've heard from a number of bands and rappers who essentially say \"Hey, I think you'll love my record because I hate George Bush.\" Well, great, but your songs suck!\n\nYeah, exactly! Any asshole can pick up a pencil and put it to music. We need to be connected to the human spirit, not the human politics. At our best, maybe we can affect the collective consciousness. I personally am too smart to try to waste everyone's time telling you things that you know more about.\n\nTo feel your album 100%, do you think the listener has to know New York, to have New York in their bones the way you do?\n\nI look at it like this: do you feel that way when you watch Taxi Driver?\n\nSure, a little bit.\n\nThen the answer is \"Yes.\" When I watch Taxi Driver, that shit reminds me of my childhood, so I have an extra perspective on a film that was so native to New York. When I watch Boyz N The Hood, I think it's a powerful movie, but I'm a little bit disconnected from the culture out there. I'm not making pop music, so my job is not to make everything for everyone. But that's the minutiae. The way I figured out how to make a record that connects to the most people possible is to make a record with complete disregard for trying to connect to anyone else but myself. (laughs) Because I don't think any of us are unique. We all understand pain, we all understand love, we all understand the human existence. The details may change, but the sentiment is the same.\n\nIn the early days of your career, what do you think paid off most for you? Because it isn't always a given that talent is going to rise to the surface, and nowadays the industry is even more oversaturated.\n\nIt's a combination of a complete, blind arrogance\u2014don't let anyone tell you that you suck, even if you suck\u2014and ridiculous amounts of energy and overstated ambition. That's it. If you have those things, just keep fucking going until you can't. If it changes or you don't like it anymore, move the fuck on. Until then, just write and be passionate and do the thing you believe in, period. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't."}

{"text":"FEEDBACK: A.C. NEWMAN\n\nThe New Pornographers' frontman talks about glockenspiels, his new solo disc and those easy, breezy '70s sounds.\n\nThere's one thing you need to know about A.C. Newman's new solo album, Shut Down The Streets: It's not a New Pornographers record.\n\nMaybe that's obvious to some given the absence of his fellow porn buddies (although Neko Case does make an appearance), but it wouldn't have been out of bounds for fans to expect the singer to retreat into the warm confines of the band's pumped up brand of powerful, indie pop. Instead, Shut Down The Streets is Newman's most meditative and orchestral record to date, washing itself in the low key sounds of '70s pop rock radio.\n\nSorry Twin Cinema fans, but, you know, deal.\n\nWe caught up with Newman prior to his upcoming show at Brighton Music Hall on Oct. 23 about the '70s, following his musical muse, and drawing the line between his solo work and the Pornographers.\n\nSo you just did a record release show, right? It went really good. I only played, like, six songs, so it was a short teaser. But it's as really awesome because it was the first time we were able to get the band together to play the songs live, and it was really tight. I think it sounds really good.\n\nYou've played countless shows, but is there a special energy or feeling to unveiling those new songs for the first time?\nYeah, yeah, It's very interesting, especially because you're playing new songs with new people. And I'm trying to be faithful to the record, so we've got a glockenspiel and flutes and clarinets. I'm just trying to make sure I have everything I need.\n\nIs it more difficult to prepare for a tour with so many moving pieces? No, not really. Luckily there are a lot of musicians in Woodstock (New York) where I live, so it wasn't that difficult.\n\nIt was actually pretty easy.\n\nThe record is a lot more ornate and textured. Was there something appealing about putting together a record that was more elaborate and orchestrated?\nI think I knew I wanted to do something that was a little more seventies, for lack of a better word, you know? I was listening to a lot of Gerry Rafferty and stuff like that, a lot of seventies Gordon Lightfoot. I just liked the combinations of sounds they brought into their music.\n\nDid you come up with a lot of that stuff as a kid? Not that much. I wasn't actively listening to it, but that stuff was on the radio and I heard it. I don't know. I think a lot of times I just start writing songs and start accidentally moving in a certain direction. At the start when I'm writing songs, I'm not trying to write in a certain genre. The first song on the record, \"I'm not Talking\", that was just an idea.\n\nI just thought, \"Hmm, I like this.\"\n\nThen I thought about what would be the best setting for the song, and I just felt like I should go for this ornate, really breezy feel.\n\nI just think it's a slight nod to a lot of those old record that I've always loved. Like, I've always liked Glen Campbell and stuff that has a nice, light and easy feel to it. I just tried to make a record that i sort of had been hinting at for years.\n\nAnd this is it all coming to fruition? Yeah. I don't know if it's come to fruition yet. Maybe by the next record it will have come to complete fruition. But yeah, this is me moving toward something I've always wanted to do. When I talk to people about this record in the context of all my other records,\n\nI always say I just try to be honest in what I do.\n\nI've always just done what I feel like doing in that moment.\n\nYou knew what kind of record you wanted to make and what sound you were going for. Was it hard going into recording the record with such a concrete plan?\nIt can be. I don't follow a very exact plan.There are definitely songs and lyrics where I thought \"This really fits.\" But then there are songs like \"Encyclopedia of Classic Takedowns\", which was more like \"I have this pop song, and I want to record it.\" All the other stuff is very wistful,\n\nbut that was a song about how in the middle of all these tumultuous things in your life, sometimes you don't want to deal with all the bullshit of making music and all the absurdity of it.\n\nThese songs have a more personal lean to them. Did that make them a better fit for a solo record as opposed to tracks for a New Pornographers record? They're definitely a little more personal, or what I'd call more singer\/songwritery. To me, they just didn't seem like something I would do in the New Pornographers. And that's why I thought it would be ok to have Neko (Case) on it, because it still wouldn't sound like the New Pornographers. I think although there are personal songs in the Pornographers, we're more of a rock band.\n\nIt's more collaborative, whereas this is more of a reflection of you as a songwriter.\nYeah, you could say that"}

{"text":"Cranes\n\nBestival are pleased to welcome along shoegaze legends Cranes.\n\nHailing from just across the Solent in Portsmouth, the band spent much of the late eighties and early nineties producing a prolific number of albums that never compromised on quality, producing a unique sound based around Alison Shaw's ethereal vocals backed by a razor sharp, metallic wall of sound.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus in the late nineties the band returned with a lush new ambient outlook in 2001 and have been steadily releasing material every since, which while a world away from their early gothic roots still revolves around Alison's wondrous voice."}
{"text":"I used to have a bit of obsession with the Magyars (the people, not the band). They settled what is now Hungary and have roots that trace back to my favorite figure in history: Attila the Hun. While I realize Attila did some pretty awful shit, he is also responsible for some pretty amazing things as well. The fact that he had Rome on its knees is impressive. Granted this wasn't Julius Caesar?s Rome, but that takes little away from what he did. When I think of the Huns and their conquests, I picture ragged and rolling green hills, sparsely populated with trees and rocks. There is a cinematic quality that suggests gnarly barbarians on horseback piercing the horizon in slow motion with spears in hand. Sounds dramatic, eh? One listen to \"Kings of Time\" by Finland's Magyar Posse and it makes perfect sense.\n\nRather than labeling this post rock, I prefer to think of it as past-post rock. What the hell am I talking about, you ask? While elements of big, orchestral post rock are the overriding theme in most of these songs, there's this aspect to them that harks back to hundreds of years ago. \"Kings of Time\" is filled with chant-like vocals that give these songs a classical feeling. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the 11-minute epic piece, \"Single Sparks are Not Spectral Fires.\" Opening in Godspeed You! Black Emperor fashion with minimal amp hum and guitar feedback, it slowly builds into a dense, machine-pounding fever pitch. To say this track is intense is a huge understatement. Strings climb and fall while a piano punches out each chord, before descending into a chaotic mess at the end of each bar. It's unbelievably good. Once the walls of screaming feedback hit, it's like a bomb going off in the middle of a crowded street. This should be the anthem of Attila the Hun. It's all at once majestic and raucous. I love this. But just when it seems like too much, just when it feels like the piece is about to physically assault you, it comes to a complete stop. It's like being launched into a midnight blue sky full of stars. As you grab onto the wings of a low flying bird, you are whisked away to another world that is free of blood-soaked fields. Soothing vocals chant above music that is equal parts Tortoise and some kind of traditional Finnish folk music. It's like being lost in the Tampere forest 100 miles outside Helsinki.\n\nThis song is such an adventure that one can easily get lost; it's really like three connected pieces. Each is their own entity, but they can't survive on their own. What is most impressive is not how good each part is, but how they are connected. The transitions are abrupt but perfect. It's as if one movement is swallowed by the next. By devouring itself, the song stays together and keeps things firmly on track. When the second part slows down, the listener is fooled into thinking the song is over. But it's not even close to it. Whimpering guitars are paired with whistling (yes, whistling!) and now you're stuck in the middle of some Western desert. The only thing on the horizon is a ghost town, it?s getting dark, and wolves begin to howl. It's stark. Strings tease of the coming night. More chanting is eventually overtaken by loud, distorted guitars. This is the finale; this is the part where they set off all the fireworks. For one song, \"Single Sparks are Not Spectral Fires\" is an album's worth of experience. It's absolutely brilliant.\n\nThere's an overall dark tone on this album that plays perfectly into the Hunnic mindset I have when listening to this. Minor chords are the preferred form of attack here, and they waste no time in delivering the final blows. \"Lufthan\" closes the album with grandeur and poise. Synthesizers are the leader here and they pull the instruments into battle with each other. Like the rest of the album, this track has an epic feeling to it. Each instrument is constantly chasing the synth; it is as though by killing it, they'll win, and this whole mess will be over. Midway through, it seems as though they've succeeded as the song practically disintegrates. But just when it seems it's down for the kill, it rises from the ashes and wreaks more havoc. In the end, the synth wins out and this upbeat track is the perfect end to one hell of a listening experience. I was sad that it was over, since I wanted more.\n\nIf Magyar Posse were from Montreal, they'd be huge in indie circles. They take an already proven formula (apocalyptic post rock) and turn it on its ass. This is a sprawling album that takes everything Godspeed You! Black Emperor has done and gives it a decidedly European twist. It has old world trademarks all over it, and I couldn't be happier. In that distant world, this is the soundtrack to Attila the Hun's siege of Rome. If Attila was a king then \"Kings of Time\" definitely deserves some kind of crown. This album is a masterful achievement"}
{"text":"More About\n\nIMAGINE IF LIZ Phair couldn't write, sing, or play...if Kate Moss's \"brain-dead tadpole\" persona (as Greil Marcus once referred to it) were transmuted to the audio realm...if Cat Stevens were somehow even more dunced-out and felt even sorrier for himself than usual. Then say hello to the wonderful world of Chan Marshall, a.k.a. indie-pop sensation Cat Power.\n\nTo be fair, Marshall has given the world one hell of a catch phrase. The name \"Cat Power\" promises something: It's sharp, sexy, menacing. It's light on its feet and it keeps you on edge.\n\nUnfortunately, upon playing the records, listeners immune to Marshall's hype soon figure out that \"Cat\" is short for \"catatonic.\" The singer doesn't usually raise her voice above a whisper. Occasionally, when she's feeling feisty, she cultivates a hollowed-out bellow that seems meant to convince us how deeply she's hurting inside. (It mostly serves notice that she needs to get out of the house more often.)\n\n\"Power,\" meanwhile, would seem to evoke Marshall's stubborn refusal to cultivate a mood other than petulant crabbiness. Neither pissed off at the world nor brokenhearted--\"She plays the difficult parts and I play difficult,\" she once sang--Marshall's is the voice of the trust-fund brat who has forgotten to take today's Prozac and is making you, the innocent bystander, pay for her misery.\n\nBeing unable to leave well enough alone is the mark of a true passive-aggressive, and Marshall now moves on from her own bad compositions--dumped on 1996's What Would the Community Think and 1998's Moon Pix--to foist her shtick onto the works of others. In truth, The Covers Album (Matador) does find her sounding far less agitated than usual: There are even moments, such as her zither-accompanied take on Phil Phillips's golden oldie \"Sea of Love,\" where her tongue is far enough inside her cheek to make the joke hum. But the rest of the new album feels like a conceptual exercise hinging on Marshall's uncanny ability to make every song she sings sound exactly the same, from the folk number \"Kingsport Town\" to the Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\" One and all, they sound like Mazzy Star arranged for bad folk guitar, like Low stripped of ideas, like a broken humidifier.\n\nThe tone is set by \"Satisfaction,\" a double-whammy of an opening number that's both emotionally and sonically stunted--Cat Power's trademark--by a vintage performance-art-style trick. See, Marshall's version--wink wink, nudge nudge--eliminates the song's signature riff and chorus! And given that the vocalist's entire style rests upon her sucking the air out of everything she sings until it's as flat as a crepe--boy, can't you just smell the sacrilege? Isn't the whole thing just clever as all hell?!\n\nNo, it's not. It's so obvious it's embarrassing. And Marshall's retooling reveals nothing about the song. Sure, she makes it sound callow and savagely mocking; so did Mick Jagger. But who needs \"Satisfaction\" when you're already as self-satisfied as Cat Power? On that song and elsewhere, The Covers Record amounts to a declaration of Chan Marshall's superiority to everything she touches. Why sully herself by actually attempting to do anything with these songs when she can just play the same two chords for all of them and moan distractedly?\n\nFor all the reverence Cat Power receives from disaffected art students, her posture as an artist whose soul is so fragile that it threatens to break in front of her audience may be the most purely showbiz conceit alt-rock has produced in years. Eat your heart out, Marilyn Manson."}

{"text":"Christ, Pylonesque EP [Benbecula - BEN 016, 2002]\n\nWicked stuff from Christ on the benbecula label. This, the latest seven-track EP entitled \"pylonesque ep\", is a structured piece of work, very much on the down-tempo side of things and with a melancholic touch. Starting of with \"dream of the endless\", a track that compels you to listen and making it impossible to miss the unique soundings of the strangely named artist in question. Beats, bass accompanied by among other things what could very well be a gently treated guitar. A tempo change creates a dramatic effect in this down-tempo track with an abundance of sounds. It is followed by \"arctica\", a short beat-less track with a fitting vocal sample that works as an interlude and connects the first and third track nicely. The third track \"spengly bendly\" features massive bassline alongside echoed distinct percussions and chorus sounds out of this world, the carefully crafted beats builds the track and pushes it forward, it is hypnotising and extremely beautiful. I can't say I ever heard anything quite like it. It is simply brilliant! \"pylonesque\" features a rather interesting choice of sound for building the melody. Does it work? The answer is, yes it does, another good minimal track on this intriguing circular piece of plastic. First engraved on the b-side is \"fantastic light\" and what a fitting track title it is, it is like watching the sun shining through heavily clouded skies and thereby creating a mood change in the overall sound picture. It is followed by \"perlandine friday\" featuring more of those strong melodies and reinforcing the mood change. The EP is concluded by \"absolom (for lucy)\", a track with light treading beats, clear and distinct vocal samples and melody. It is striking how well the tracks fit together and Christ's \"pylonesque ep\" is clearly benefited by a continuous and sequential play. The conclusion: a really nice benbecula release."}

But something lets it down. That something tends to be the lyrics. They have none of the punch of great pop lyrics and though they strive to be clever, they're never quite clever enough. The Bixsexual is a case in point. It's a story about Arabia being angry with another man who he thinks is trying to steal his girlfriend, only to realise that it's not the girlfriend his rival is interested in. It's a neat conceit but the lyric doesn't really manage to do much with the set-up. It's a story without a punchline.\n\nAh but the music is pure joy.

{"text":"Imagine Dragons is a study in contradictions\n\nThe guys in Imagine Dragons just can't figure out why their touring vehicle\u2014a 1953 Chevrolet pickup truck with no headlights, taillights, or brakes\u2014keeps getting pulled over by highway patrol officers.\n\nOn a purely sonic level, \"It's Time\" couldn't be more celebratory. Built on a foundation of multilayered percussion and coloured by such unlikely bedfellows as ringing mandolin and soaring synths, it has the type of chorus that pushes a song into instant-anthem territory. And then the bridge hits, and you notice that what Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds is singing about is the futility of trying to stay still in the face of life's inexorable forward momentum: \"This road never looked so lonely\/This house doesn't burn down slowly\/To ashes! \/To ashes!\"\n\nIf that seems to run counter to the song's chorus, on which Reynolds asserts \"I'm never changing who I am,\" then so be it. The Las Vegas\u2013based Imagine Dragons deals in contradictions and is often at its most triumphant-sounding when the subject matter is bleak.\n\nReached at a Boise, Idaho, tour stop, the quartet's guitarist, Wayne Sermon, says it's all by design. \"No human event is ever just one thing, you know? Each person can run the gamut of the human emotional scale. We want to represent all of that, not just one part of it. So that entails times when you feel dark and you have demons inside of you, and songs like 'Radioactive' that just pump you up and make you feel energized. There's a lot of different ways to inspire and to make music, so we try to explore all of them as much as we can.\"\n\nHe's not kidding. The band has its signatures, such as Reynolds's emotive singing and the use of multiple rhythmic elements (often handclaps and sequenced beats layered over the standard drum kit), but the songs on Imagine Dragons' debut LP, Night Visions, are eclectic. \"Underdog\", for instance, snakes buzzing synthesizer lines through a pulse reminiscent of warm-heart-of-Africa dance music as played by droids. \"Demons\", on the other hand, is a soul-searching ballad anchored to the kind of epic breakbeat that OneRepublic would trade its platinum records for.\n\nSermon explains that the group's proficiency with different styles was earned the hard way, through night after night spent playing covers of everything from the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to the Cars and the Cure in bars and lounges on and off the Las Vegas strip. Although he, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer-violist Daniel Platzman all studied at Boston's Berklee College of Music, the guitarist insists that it was their time as a cover band that was their real education.\n\n\"There's things I learned at school that I'm very grateful for, and the connections I made while I was there were invaluable, because that's where I met the bass player and the drummer. I studied a lot of jazz music, and the other guys did too. That's all there. I don't really think about it as much as I did. I'm sure it's influenced my playing. I'm sure it's influenced the other musicians that went to school. At the end of the day, learning the songs of the masters\u2014I think there's not really any better education than that.\""}
{"text":"Ever heard of the band Broken Bells? I've recently discovered them, and I was relieved to find out that they've only been around for about 10 months.\n\nIt's a duo of guys who had previously been associated with other acts: Brian Burton (aka Danger Mouse) and James Mercer, who is\/was the lead singer and guitarist for The Shins. They met at a Danish music festival back in 2004 and clicked ever since.\n\nTheir debut album, Broken Bells, was released on March 9, 2010 in the United States and Canada, and was actually pretty well-received, peaking at #7 on the Billboard 200. It seems, though, that the band is starting to pick up speed these days. I've seen their music floating around the internet over the past couple of weeks, and I have to say, I like what I'm seeing and hearing.\n\nI'm listening to the album and it absolutely sounds like an exact mixture of both of them. You can hear a little bit of The Shins in there, but not so much that they seem identical. Their first single, \"The High Road,\" was passed around the internet back in December to fans and subscribers as a free download, so it ended up reaching as high as #21 on the Billboard U.S. Rock charts.\n\nThe current single, \"The Ghost Inside,\" is equally good. It's so unique that I'm not sure I can put a label on it, in terms of genre. You just have to check it out, and the rest of their music, too! I'm excited to see more from them."}
{"text":"Popular\n\nMUSIC REVIEW: Dixie Chicks\n\nGiven the backlash, boycotts, and even death threats they've had to endure in the three years since Natalie Maines made the unfortunate mistake of exercising her right of free speech, you can hardly blame the Dixie Chicks for wanting to distance themselves from the country establishment. Taking the Long Way, however, doesn't seem to be the right answer. Submerging their main strengths - especially the dazzling instrumental interplay of sisters Emily Robison (banjo) and Martie Maguire (fiddle) - under Rick Rubin's kitchen-sink production, the Chicks sound more like average L.A. pop-rockers than a Texas bluegrass-based trio. There are moments: The high-flying \"Lubbock or Leave It\" and the uncluttered pro-peace anthem \"I Hope\" are as good as anything they've ever done. Let's just hope they aren't completely abandoning their inner Dixie; that'd really be throwing out the baby with the bathwater."}

It's a great reminder that there are real musicians behind the music that inspired all those hipster dance battles I was mixed up in all summer. Tickle that ivory and tell me you're mine."}
{"text":"You can practically hear the waves on This Is How We Swim, written while singer-songwriter Lisa Bozikovic was living on the Toronto Islands. Produced by Sandro Perri, Bozikovic's follow-up to her 2009 debut, Lost August, sounds like it was recorded in an air bubble underwater.\n\nBut if you're looking for a Best Coast\u2013style romp in the sand, keep moving. The album's cozy warmth and Bozikovic's gentle but steady voice belie a melancholy that slips around the corners of her twisted melodies and vocal runs. The album's darkest song, the wonderfully gloomy lead single, \"Into the Waves,\" perfectly evokes the walking-dead state of a post-breakup depression.\n\nFrom start to finish, the album is an exercise in restraint; Bozikovic displays a powerful control over her voice, switching from deep murmur to lovely falsetto with complete ease. \"I roll with the waves,\" she sings on the title track; after a few listens, you'll feel the same.\n\nPlaylist picks: \"Into the Waves,\" \"This Is How We Swim,\" \"No Monument\"\n\nLisa Bozikovic plays a CD release show at the Music Gallery (197 John St.) on Sept. 7."}
{"text":"Post-rock is pretty hip these days, but many people think only at Sigur R\u00f3s or God Is An Astronaut when they hear \"post-rock\". So lets see a bunch of other post-rock bands that are not that famous, but that cool!\n\n1. Maybeshewill (United Kingdom)\n\nThis is the main reason that made me write this post. A brilliant five piece band from Leicester, active since 2005, with three albums in the pocket. Their sound features lots of piano and keyboard, although their keyboard player Matthew Daly is a full member only from 2011 (the band used samples for live shows until then). However, their song \"The Paris Hilton Sex Tape\" from their 2006 release \"Japanese Spy Transcript\" does not contain any moan by Paris (youtube that, but don't forget to include \"maybeshewill\" in the search field). The band tours pretty often in the UK, Europe and Asia, sometimes opening for bigger acts like God is an Astronaut. They run their own non-profit independent record label called \"Robot Needs Home\".\n\n2. Russian Circles (U.S.A.)\n\nA very powerful and original trio from the States, featuring a sampling\/effects\/looper-loving guitar player, a gay bass player and a 4\/4 drummer, (where 4\/4 does not stand at all for a measure, but for a 4 piece drum-kit with 4 cymbals). The term \"russian circles\" stands for an excruciating drill exercise used in ice hockey. So does the band actually live their band name? The Circles tour with Coheed And Cambria and Between The Buried And Me. Puck them on their Facebook page, they opened for Tool in the U. K. in 2007!\n\n3. Yndi Halda (England)\n\nPronounced YIN-dee hal-DAR, the band also features a violin player, which confirms their modern classic status. Active since 2001, the band started playing live only in 2007, switching from mostly electronic instruments to acoustic ones. They played only two shows in 2012, they sell their amps on Facebook and have a great EP released in 2007. \"Yndi Halda\" is Old Norse (a North Germanic language) for their self-titled debut called \"Enjoy Eternal Bliss\".\n\n4. Mono (Japan)\n\nOk, they have over 50k likes on Facebook, but this is probably because they have a girl on bass! Playing since 1999 with the same line-up, they just released their 6th album for their parents. Mono loves Iceland, the glockenspiel, reverb, distortion and delay. They play in stereo all over the world and you can find them on their official website.\n\n5. Tides from Nebula (Poland)\n\nPolski zesp\u00f3\u0142 post-rockowy utworzony w 2008 roku w Warszawie. This means that they are from Warsaw, formed in 2008 and they post-rock. Considered as one of the best \"export goods\" in Poland, the band released \"Aura\" in 2009 and \"Earthshine\" in 2011. Their latest single \"Hollow Lights\" was sold out in 4 hours and, of course, they use twitter and instagram, and they have no English Wiki page"}
{"text":"THE SEMINAL TEST\n\nRocket from the Tombs meets the strict requirements. Do you?\n\nTags:\n\nRocket from the Tombs circa 1974\n\n\"Seminal.\"\n\nThe word gets thrown around like fists between inmates. And you're bound to hear it this week, when Cleveland protopunks Rocket from the Tombs--among the first originators of classic Midwest punk back in 1974--hit the city on a reunion tour. But what does \"seminal\" really mean, and, more importantly, how does an artist like RFTT get fitted for the honorary title?\n\nAt its core, seminal means influential, the first of a series that notably affected subsequent generations. Chat up any trivia-thumping supergeek, however, and it becomes obvious that a band's obscurity is also crucial. Even if Nirvana rearranged the face of contemporary rock music, you're not bloody likely to hear Joe Record Collector admit it. But Rocket from the Tombs? Pure seminal mid-'70s punk, a thermometer-bursting stew of acidic guitar basheroo and boiling nihilism--made all the hotter by the fact that the original RFTT didn't even last a full year in existence.\n\nIf you extrapolate the concept that Seminality (X) = Influence + Obscurity, you can properly rate a band like RFTT by using this fun and quasi-scientific formula:\n\nHere M = Number of Members who went onto more famous pursuits. RFTT featured David Thomas and Peter Laughner (of Pere Ubu) plus Gene \"Cheetah Chrome\" O'Connor and John \"Johnny Blitz\" Madansky (of the Dead Boys). A grand slam of punk-rock royalty! Thus M = 4 points!\n\nR = Royalty-free cover versions. Although the Dead Boys and Ubu may have popularized them later, \"Sonic Reducer,\" \"Ain't It Fun\" and \"Final Solution\" are all RFTT originals--and who knows how many times they've helped expand nascent punkers' setlists ever since? R = 9 points!\n\nHRI = Horn Rim Index. Or, the number of times per week a band is \"casually\" mentioned by a record-store clerk, zine columnist, bartender, barista, vintage slacks retailer, etc., to prove his\/her hipster IQ. Hell, RFTT's Pere Ubu connection alone gets mega-cred in the music-nerd demographic. And if exasperated eye-rolls result when you accidentally mention 1990s San Diego band Rocket from the Crypt instead, score a bonus point! HRI = 4 points!\n\nCMJ = College Music Journal. Count how many collegiate radio playlists the band makes; look for RFTT spins on those smug old-skool shows with names like \"The Roots of Cool\" or \"Back When It Mattered.\" CMJ = 6 points!\n\nE = Number of Entercom (or Clear Channel, etc.) radio stations who've actually aired songs by said artist. Everyone knows those corporate playlists are compiled by \"accountants instead of music fans\" (as Dead Kennedys once noted), so RFTT wouldn't even make a dent. E = Zilch!\n\nSo there it is. Now we simply do the math and see that, um, well...who really cares about stupid scenester points anyway? As a 1970s American punk progenitor, RFTT can be proud merely for its contributions to underground rock history: songs, musicians and a whispered cult reverence that have outlasted many lesser mortals. It's seminal. Just because."}
{"text":"Reviews\n\nThe xx - Coexist\n\nUntil The Mercury Music Prize, a lot of folk didn't really give an fXXk about The xx and only their critically acclaimed self-titled debut see them catapulted into the stratosphere. All of a sudden, 10,000 people had seen them play at their early gigs in grotty pubs.\n\nSpeak to some people and they'll tell you that The xx aren't the most accessible of groups to get into. Musically, they are still ahead of most British bands and have churned out another unique album that sets them apart from standard indie albums with big guitar licks and electronic albums with all sorts of bleeps and wobble.\n\nWhilst pressure will already be heaped on previous acclaim that The xx picked up, band member Jamie XX already has a high profile name for himself with solo material and remix work. It's not as if the likes of Florence and the Machine, Adele and Radiohead would ask a novice to rework their efforts. So will this follow up see too much of his involvement and transform the album into a more dance-orientated affair?\n\nFans of The xx's won't find themselves faced with a dancefloor stomper. Once again, they are bringing back the calm with the occasional stuttering of drum machine that brings up the tempo, but not enough to really get a real buzz generated. But then, why should everything make you dance? The underlining musicianship in tracks like 'Sunset' really stand out. More dark and moody tones set the tone for a more negative space but deliver it without bringing all of your emotions down.\n\nPeople who are firm fans of the band won't find any issues with 'Coexist' though outsiders may still find it slightly isolating in parts. Songs sometimes feel like they could develop and go elsewhere, but the minimal tones have already won The xx enough fans and praise. So why change"}
{"text":"Though the melodies aren't quite as instantly memorable, the album is in many ways superior to its predecessor. The band's multi-part harmonies function more as a piece of the wide-screen arrangements rather than the dominant feature. The voice of Robin Pecknold is more out front and lyrically direct; against an intricate web of counterpoint melodies, he plays the troubled narrator wrestling with his place in the world. Employing everything from woodwinds to Tibetan singing bowls, with finger-picked acoustic guitars sailing atop rumbling timpani, the band makes a wonderful sound: rich but not overstuffed, intricate but not labored, virtuosic without sounding like anyone's showing off. The songs don't stick to verse-chorus formula, they're more like mini-suites that turn and twist without drawing attention to their complexity.\n\nIf there's a shortcoming, it's that the band is almost too subtle for its own good; all that beauty and detail is rarely played for dramatic effect. When Pecknold's pristine voice rises and finally cracks on \"The Shrine\/An Argument,\" followed by a free-jazz freak-out, it's the type of musical jolt the rest of the album lacks.\n\nBut such outbursts probably wouldn't make sense in fleshing out the album's central theme. \"Could I wash my hands of just looking out for me?\" Pecknold sings on \"Montezuma.\" On the title song, he declares his desire to \"be a functioning cog in some great machinery, serving something beyond me.\"\n\nIn striving for more self-less version of self, Pecknold and his excellent band have made an album that embraces modesty. Which is why it may take a few listens for its rarefied combination of beauty and anxiety to hit home. In this case, another virtue that Pecknold extols -- patience \u2013 has its rewards.\n\n\"You may need to spend significant time questioning and even disliking Helplessness Blues before it reveals its gifts to you, but given that its creation is forever connected with human suffering, that price is only fitting"}
{"text":"Tinariwen - Aman Iman: Water Is Life\n\nAlbum Details\n\nBy mixing blues and hard funk with traditional North African folk rhythms, Tinariwen manage to ease you into new sounds while keeping you grounded in those you know and love. It took these former freedom fighters about twenty years to be able to record these tracks and those on their first two records; many are decades old and have been carried around and polished by the band all these years, befitting the nomadic nature of the band and of the people whose lives and struggles they celebrate in song. This is real rebel music, made by men battle tested in the fight for freedom; and it rocks too!From blues and funk jams like \"Cler Achel\" and \"Assouf,\" the psych dub of Toumast,\" to straight-on rockers like \"Matadjem Yinmixan,\" Tinariwen sing and play with abandon and a sense of purpose. English lyrics are provided; singer Ibrahim Ag Alhabib's plaintive yet defiant delivery is universal\u2014it is the sound of real experience and wisdom. File \"Water is Life\" with your blues or your Dylan or even your punk records. Water Is Life is brave, and as respectful of the traditional as it seeks to move beyond it into something raw and new.\n\nReview:\n\nWhen faced with an album such as \"Aman Iman\" you have to tread very carefully. The tendency is always going to be there to slip into some cliched statements about music returning to its West African roots, or jabbering on about how the band have melded western instruments with traditional rhythms and themes to bring a truly vivid blah blah talk guff guff pretentious blah bull guff blah shit blah blah.\n\nTake this extract from a review (not on this site): a classic piece of kaftan-wearing, free-trade-organic-frappuchino-drinking, Hampstead-chattering-class, organic-sun-blushed tomato-cooking-on-an-antique-aga, pompous wankery\n\n\"When you hear this music clan...a listener can hear the calm of the desert night air and the serenity of the musicians who live there. The Taureg (sic) people truly seem to be of the land and never more so than here.\"\n\nPseuds who write nonsense like that in a music review need to be slapped. He can't even spell Tuareg!\n\nSo let's get a few things straight. What this is, pure and simple, is a flexibly sized group of Tuareg guys, with a core of five or so at the heart, writing songs in a style familiar to them, and playing them on whatever musical instruments they see fit. It is a not a musical bridge across cultures: it is not a unique statement; it is not a reason to go all orgasmic about the purity of Tuareg culture. It is, nothing more nothing less, music. An electric guitar is an electric guitar. It doesn't sound inherently different if a Tuareg guy plays it than it would if a Papuan tribesman did. Each may bring their musical heritage to the table, and this will show in the arrangements of the chords and the pace of the rhythm, but it does not become a different instrument, better or worse, depending on who's playing it. Similarly with the vocals. If you are a Tuareg looking for vocal backing for a song, it is not surprising that the female ululating voice will feature.\n\nWhy then, do some people try to convey the impression that this is something different to what it actually is - music? What makes some pretentious poser describe the guitars, as I read in one magazine review, as \"dusty\"? For God's sake, dusty can be used to describe its colour, its physical appearance or the condition in which it has been kept, not its sound! This kind of description does no credit to the music. Some will jump on this as a cultural bandwagon as if this is some sort of politically correct requirement: others will shun it because they detect too much pretension. Neither appreciates it for the music it contains.\n\nSo, what is the music that it contains? And why is it worth listening to, and possibly getting into if you like the sound of it? Well, at its heart lie traditional Tuareg musical structures. The percussion consists of small drums, tambourines and a good deal of clapping. There is quite a bit of call and response vocals, with the response often delivered by a chorus of male and female voices. Sometimes, there is ululation which can be a bit disconcerting to those of us not used to that particular vocal technique.\n\nWhat makes this though, without doubt, are the guitars. Their starting point is a light, almost funky rhythm reminiscent of Carlos Santana. The rhythm guitar provides a solid funky foundation which never threatens to overpower. The combination of percussion, vocals and rhythm guitar thus forms a musical canvas over which the lead guitar chatters, writhes and spins in and out of the sound. Sometimes in the background, sometimes coming to the fore, the lead guitar really makes the music stand out. In spite of what you may read elsewhere, the guitars do not sound any different, they are just used in a sometimes unfamiliar way to create a sound which is both recognisable and unfamiliar at the same time.\n\nIt would be pointless to describe individual tracks, because together they comprise a suite of music which is its own reference point. Just listen to the sound, enjoy the way the guitar draws you into the heart, and put aside any prejudices, preconceived notions or inappropriate pomposity about the nobility of the Tuareg soul, the purity of the culture, the ethereal beauty of the desert (ridiculous cliches all). Just take it as it is, like you would any other music, and decide for yourself whether you like it.\nRating: 7\/10"}
{"text":"The Underground Man - Knows Me Better\n\nWhen this EP came through the SYFFAL pipeline (music submission bro, not an euphamism for gay sex bro), I was apprehensive about listening to it because it seemed a bit on the tame side. That all changed when I saw the 50s reference.\n\nI'm a fucking sucker for nostalgia when it's related to those specific decades where shit was simple, dudes wore pomade, paranoia was spread via word of mouth, and no body talked about masturbating to a vacuum cleaner ad because it showed a lil' freckled ankle. The EP for The Underground Man was specifically successful in transporting me back to a place in time when one could fear incineration from a Russian nuke at any time, feel safe from said incineration in hiding under one's grade school desk in an assumed position, and the canning of fruits was an acceptable hobby due to said potential for said incineration.\n\nThe Underground Man sounds like the shit you hear over the loud speaker in old school department stores, it's half romantic, and three quarters fucking creepy, evoking an image of Chris Isaak toting a tommy gun. The opening and title track Knows Me Better sounds like a song you'd hear over a handheld radio turned on just after the blanket was spread out over the grass at make out point, which I hear is a dumping ground for a handful of different serial killers these days. Seriously, this shit is adorable and crime novel sassy at the same time.\n\nIf you're looking for a throwback, cool out, smoke a filterless cigarette, wear a trench coat and fit in, solve a murder mystery in San Francisco that's 77% more entertaining than an episode of Alcatraz on FOX, give The Underground Man and the Knows Me Better EP a spin bro bro."}

{"text":"Oyster #98: Cut Copy\n\n\"I like the idea of being a fan again.\"\n\nEven though they were robbed at the Grammys (by Skrillex!), I still love Cut Copy as much as the time I first heard 'Saturdays' late one night in a taxi. Heads and hearts halfstuck in another time and place, they make music for the perpetual nostalgic and the hopeless romantic. We met up to talk about the sounds of the past, present and future \u2014 so it was only fitting that the car-turned-timemachine from Back to the Future turned up and nearly distracted us all into oblivion.\n\nEmily Royal: What's your earliest memory of hearing music? Dan Whitford: My parents were endlessly listening to jazz records. So, for the first 20 years of my life I couldn't listen to jazz; I couldn't disconnect it from my parents. In terms of pop music, it would've been Michael Jackson. Tim Hoey: I joined a Michael Jackson fan club. I would take a picture of him to my hairdresser \u2014 from around the Bad era, when he had the Jheri curl \u2014 and I'd ask for her to cut my hair like that, but she never did. Whitford: You could probably almost do it these days. It was too straight back then, but now\u2026 Hoey: Well, I couldn't understand what the problem was. My parents listened to a lot of country music, so it just became background for me. My sister was really into INXS. I think Kick was the first album I ever bought, or maybe she bought it for me, but that was the first time I really started taking notice of music. Mitchell Scott: I have an early memory of watching Jesus and Mary Chain playing Sidewalking. I also remember my brother and I listening to the Top 40 and making mixtapes. At this point a DeLorean drives past. Whitford: Holy shit \u2014 that's a DeLorean! I have never seen a DeLorean in the flesh before. Hoey: That's insane! Whitford: What the fuck?!\n\nIt's got brand new plates! Whitford: I didn't know someone in Melbourne had a DeLorean. Scott: That's wild. Whitford: I've got to get a photo. Scott: [Focuses] Anyway, we were making tapes of the Top 40 countdown\u2026\n\nAnd you'd edit out the ads? Scott: Well, we'd just choose certain songs. Like, we'd always start recording each song, and then if we didn't like it we'd stop and rewind. It was a bit of a process.\n\nIt's an art. Hoey: [Still staring at the DeLorean] We should have that car for the photoshoot. Whitford: It's OK, I got a shot of it. Scott: The driver's on the wrong side! Whitford: It'd be American, I guess. I don't know if they made them anywhere other than the States. Hoey: I don't think there's a factory in Collingwood. Whitford: Sorry, this is blowing my mind right now. Continue!\n\nWait, what does the driver look like? Whitford: You mean, is it Michael J. Fox?\n\nNo, is it just someone? It's just some dude, isn't it. Whitford: Usually people in crazy cars like that are just someone normal. It's not, like, Usher.\n\nIt's never Usher. Speaking of major megasuperstars, who do you like? Is there anyone who you think is actually pretty good, even though their music is everywhere? Whitford: It's hard to pull someone out, at least for me. I think we're going through a bit of a period \u2014 or have been for a while now \u2014 where good music and popular music are divorced from one another. In the seventies you'd have this bubblegum-pop stuff, but then you'd also have these big-name artists doing their own thing \u2014 like Bowie, who was hugely popular but also wrote a lot of his own songs, produced his own records, worked with interesting people and was experimental as well. Now record companies are less likely to put their faith in people to make interesting pop records. They'd much rather get someone to write the song, get a hot-shot producer, and then find someone with the right look to represent it, instead of saying, \"Who's that weird British guy who looks like an alien? Let's take a chance on him.\" Hoey: Really mainstream stuff today has lost that subversive quality that it once had back when songs were kind of crossover. Whitford: Like, Lady Gaga is sort of subversive, but the actual music doesn't measure up. If the music was amazing I guess I'd be all over it. That's the disappointing part \u2014 the subversiveness is there, but it's lacking any real substance. Scott: And you're not going to find it from other mainstream pop acts like Chris Brown.\n\nWhat about rap and hip hop? Hoey: I'm not into it as much as I was in the nineties. Hip hop took over punk in the eighties and went for gold \u2014 like, instead of staying underground it sort of went for a broader consciousness, especially with groups like Public Enemy and NWA and then in the nineties Wu-Tang Clan and Dr Dre; people like that, I was really into. But I'm sure there are still really interesting things out there \u2014 Gonjasufi is someone who we've really gotten into in the last few years; he took hip hop and made it psychedelic. But, as far as really mainstream hip hop and R&B \u2026 it just washes over me, I don't get excited about any of it.\n\nWhat about someone like Lana del Rey? Scott: I've just heard the hype. Hoey: It's like the dubstep thing, for me. I don't really know what it is, but I hear a lot about it. Whitford: There's a bit of a phenomenon right now with pre-packaging indie stars the same way you'd do with a pop star. She's obviously someone who is talked about in those terms. I've heard it talked about in relation to Foster the People, but I think they are probably a genuine band that's benefited from having a major label push and having everything working for them; people are suspicious of their quick rise, though. But, specifically about Lana del Rey, I don't know \u2014 mainly because it's just not really the sort of music I listen to. Scott: You don't want to feel like you're being lied to. I think people can appreciate things that are manufactured, but people start to feel weird when they come across something that is manufactured but presented as though it's completely genuine.\n\nIt's like they think we won't know better. Scott: Exactly. Hoey: You're always going to be skeptical of something that's being pushed down your throat.\n\nWhat about new music? Hoey: For me, Connan Mockasin's Forever Dolphin Love was definitely a record that sounded like something from the future to me. That record has really blown me away \u2014 to the point where I actually had to track him down and write to him and tell him how much I thought it was really beautiful and amazing and something new. I like the idea of being a fan again \u2026 Now I make a really conscious decision to try and find new and interesting music, and he's probably been the best example, for me, of someone doing something really new.\n\nIs there a sound that defines this era? Like, today? Whitford: Dubstep? Hoey: [Laughs] Whitford: I don't think so. There are a few things that are kind of definitive, but we're in a weird time; trends have become so fragmented because of the internet. There are a million little sub-genres happening all at once. Animal Collective has been something we've followed for a while. Since their last record it seems like there's a whole bunch of post\u2013Animal Collective bands around doing stuff that sounds reminiscent of their sound and style. You can tell the influence that they've had. Hoey: And it comes back to great songwriting as well \u2014 not necessarily sounding like one thing or another. The craftsmanship is something that we really appreciate. Whitford: The challenge for a lot of modern musicians is to find an angle that sets them apart more than fitting in to the latest trend. People are hungry to hear something different to everything else. Like, if punk was big, people would want to hear something that has punk references in it but also sounds different. I guess that's the weird thing: we're in an era where music sounds really referential. Scott: And people are so aware of what their contemporaries are doing, because it's so much easier to be across everything that's going on currently. So, people used to be aware of what was happening in music, but more so in their town or country, which would lead to more of a Melbourne sound, or a Seattle sound, or a Dunedin sound. Now the same sort of thing exists, but there's no real barrier on it. It's not just a matter of going to the pub and seeing a band play, it's about being able to access it through a million other means. Those tight geographical scenes don't form the way they used to.\n\nTheoretically, then, what's going to happen? Whitford: To me, the fact that everything's so fragmented means that it's breaking down the way that major record labels run the music industry. Someone was saying that around a third of the Grammy winners this year were independent artists. So, it seems like the hold that major labels had over the music industry \u2014 and we're distributed through major labels, so we're part of this as well \u2014 is loosening. I see the end point, hopefully, as being a shift back to the importance of making good records and good music, rather than pre-packaging and making music on a production line; actually turning it into something where artists make music. If you like the music then you listen to it, if you don't then you'll listen to something else. To me, that's the way the industry should work. Hoey: And at the time it's tough to be aware of what's really making an impact. A lot of it comes from hindsight \u2014 a lot of great records don't become big until ten, fifteen years later. There's an idea of being desperate for something new, but disappointed with anything but the familiar \u2014 \"We recolonise past and future,\" which is actually a JG Ballard quote. At the time you don't think about it too much; it's always in retrospect that you go, \"Oh wow, that was a really important scene in music.\" Whitford: People are always trying to figure it out. I guess if you knew it at the time you'd be going out and making those records yourself."}
{"text":"Music Review: Toro y Moi\n\n3\/5 stars\n\nOne of the pioneering forces behind the chillwave movement, Chaz Bundick has set out to make his third record pop. Yes, literally, pop music. It's a head-scratching move for someone who was at the forefront of an underground music movement. Pop has a kind of disdain attached to it, especially within the chillwave community. It's synthesized music in the way that chillwave musicians are often trying to challenge and nuance.\n\nSo why is Chaz Bundick moving to pop music? If we take him at his own word, Bundick hopes he's refined a sound that his \"girlfriend can dance to.\" If that's what he was going for, a few tracks on Anything in Return are sure successes. Opener \"Harm in Change\" begins at a hurried pace that's reminiscent of his past singles, but when the electric organ comes in, the track moves in the direction of art house music. The song's sampled vocals, from an unnamed female soul singer, are the kind I'd expect from The Weeknd, not Toro y Moi. Likewise, \"So Many Details\" benefits from Bundick's seductive croons. His voice is louder, clearer and more confident than it has ever been. Both tracks are more accessible than most chillwave and much less aloof. Maybe Bundick, the 26-year old, has started to move away from the somewhat-apathetic instincts of his earlier works. In its place is a sound that's catchier and more lively, if less obviously polished.\n\nWhile Bundick succeeds in making his pop record, parts of the album feel forced, regressions from his typically effortless productions. \"Touch\" and \"Cola\" sound essentially the same, with droning beats and unimpressive, borderline lazy, repetition. The droning might have worked in the context of a chillwave album, but in a record that is so noticeably pop, the tracks feel tired and out of place. \"Cake\" and \"Day One\" have the opposite problem. They're reminiscent of the sugarcoated songs I'd expect to hear from cheap mainstream pop. That is, they sounded more or less like Toro y Moi trying to imitate pop, as if he wanted to honor the return of Justin Timberlake. And with lines such as \"I'm all right \/ she's all right \/ we're all right\" and \"Imma be her boy forever\" Bundick's lyrics also leave something to be desired.\n\nThe best tracks on Anything in Return balance Bundick's electro-pop with the more methodical pace of his earlier work. \"Rose Quartz\" is the most expertly crafted track on the album. Unlike most of the pop songs, \"Quartz\" shows Bundick the minimalist. The loops build slowly and the vocals are quiet enough to not overwhelm the backdrop. \"High Living\" is another song that benefits from its relaxed pace. Its funk-inspired percussion and high-pitched melodies are catchy, and it's one of a handful of moments on the album when Toro y Moi successfully incorporates tropes from other genres. Elsewhere on the album there are influences from darker versions of disco, some R&B and even, occasionally, jazz\u2014all arranged in the midst of his characteristic lo-fi haze. Though it's clear that Bundick wants to makes danceable music, the best tracks on Anything in Return reconcile pop with his older aesthetic."}
{"text":"Ikara Colt - Modern Apprentice\n\nAlbum Details\n\nIt seems like in the last couple years, the world has had the big rock 'n' roll revival that they've been waiting for since the early 80's. And while it's a good thing that the music is reaching the mainstream once again, it's really just getting a little tiresome by now. A lot of these bands, such as Jet, are just (blatantly) ripping off songs of the past (\"Lust for Life\"), so the new movement of rock really doesn't have the force or longevity of the 60's and 70's culture.\n\nIkara Colt, who hail from the UK, released their first album Chat and Business in 2002. Critics seemed to like it, and the band developed a small fanbase during this time, although they still aren't really a mainstream group. In many ways, they've just remade their debut album with Modern Apprentice, although there's one major difference: it's faster, louder, and more violent and aggressive.\n\nThe opening track, \"Wanna Be That Way,\" kicks off with the bass pounding dents into your brain while guitar feedback drones above it, leading up to the predictable snare drum smack that signals the start of the blazingly fast opening riff. By the time lead singer Paul Resende comes with the vocals, you could swear that you've heard the song a thousand times before.\n\nThat's really Modern Apprentice's only fault; none of it sounds new. Whether it's the dance-punk of \"Modern Feeling\" or the straight-up fuzzy rock 'n' roll of \"I'm With Stupid,\" it all recalls the tunes of too many bands that have come before it. And herein lies another problem with this new rock 'n' roll revival - it's hard to separate the bands who truly breathe and feel the music from those who are just jumping on the bandwagon to try to hit it big and make a couple dollars. While Ikara Colt definitely lets the listeners know who their influences are, the band doesn't really have enough enthusiasm to belong to the former category."}
{"text":"Ted Joyner and Grant Widmer (no relation to Charles, we're assuming, because that dude is fictional), following the dissolution their previous band, Louisiana stalwarts and media darlings Eames Era, hunkered down and recorded a new record, packed to the brim with deeply catchy and hook-laden pop-influenced rock tracks. Immediately following the mastering of the album, which they'd intended to release on their own, they serendipitously bumped into a Park the Van exec; after the label heard the album, Con Law, Generationals quickly joined the PTV roster. (I'm not employed by a record label, but I assume you don't let a pitch this fat sneak by without taking a big cut at it.) The album will be released sometime in July.\n\nFor a limited time, the album streams live here; a couple of clear highlights are the slinky guitar line and cacophonous, explosive chorus on \"Bobby Beale,\" and the hand claps, classic rock keyboard riff, funky horns and kitchen sink percussion of \"When They Fight, They Fight,\" both of which are going to have you chomping at the bit for the album's release. Catch a listen before the stream goes down. It will give you something to look forward to in July.\n\nWe're not going to hit you with a full-scale review right now. We want you to wrap your brain around it without our input first. Listen to the stream, form an opinion and then let it simmer in the back of your brain until the summer. We don't doubt that you're going to be hearing a lot about Generationals in the immediate future.\n\nWe assure you that it's good, but that's all that we're going to say.\n\nWe're also pleased to release a track into the ether. \"Angry Charlie\" is a Citizen Dick premiere. I walked on a red carpet to my computer this morning, wearing a tuxedo for this momentous event. It's a song that's going to stick in your craw for a bit, so reserve at least seven minutes where you're unoccupied. You're going to want to hear this one twice in a row"}

What I noticed right away is that her fifth (not counting worship outings) release is full of musical punch. Crunchy guitars, escalating choruses, and synth-happy riffs you might find at a Trans Siberian Orchestra concert permeate this record. It's outstanding. Just like Jaci Velasquez was not going to sit around and get obfuscated by the din of over-coverage and replaceable melody lines, St. James wants to challenge herself."}

{"text":"Soltero: You're No Dream\n\nIn the liner notes to his fifth Soltero album, You're No Dream, Tim Howard writes that he wanted the album \"to be slight and unsure, like a novice pickpocket.\" The album definitely has an air of uncertainty to it. With none of the rock trappings of his previous, equally excellent Hell Train, You're No Dream actually does carry some of the atmosphere associated with dreams: a strangeness both pretty and mysterious. The mood is richly defined and vague, crystal-clear and open. Ghosts of pop music past mingle with the musical perspective of one wandering would-be folk singer. The album sounds like we're inside one man's head. And the songs themselves fit that as well, with unsteady journeys of the heart a major theme. Even the most seemingly direct songs\u2014the marriage-pondering duo \"Wedding Song\" and \"Sinkhole\", the creepy maybe-stalker song \"Prick on the Prowl\"\u2014carry a lot of questions and confusion. At one point in the album, Howard sings, \"Everyone thinks that we're OK \/ because they don't hear what we don't say.\" You're No Dream seems filled with those things unsaid, and with the sounds and silence that echo around inside our heads."}

{"text":"I Need a KILO Tonight! \u2013 [Kilo Kish Interview]\n\nThe Florida native's current stop is Atlanta, GA- the home of Peachtrees and sweet, sweet, sweet tea. Clad in all black with sunglasses on deck and custom cutoff shorts that match (boy, you know what comes next\u2026), Kilo Kish effortlessly captivates her audience as she floats her way to the stage and grasps the microphone. The last act of the night, her performance begins just like her EP does- melodic and mellow.\n\n\"Your head is on my pillow\/ I'm thinking of where this could go\/ I'm slowing down the tempo\/ your eyes so black, they're like the universe to me\/ I think that what I'm trying to see\/ Is if you have enough to be\/ every part of every thing\u2026\"\n\nDuring down time of the current record, she surprises spectators by placing the microphone in front of a random fan's face. \"Say whatever you want.\" \"I love you\u2026\" Is all he can muster up.\n\nGreedmont Park: I'm going to do something similar to what's done during your set- blurt out phrases, and request that you unveil the first thing that comes to your mind once you hear these words. No over-thinking, no filter!\n\nColor. Kilo Kish: Turquoise.\n\nRosetta Stone. French.\n\nPatterns.\nAwesome.\n\nWinter Park.\nFlorida.\n\nMeow Mix.\nKitty.\n\nThe Lottery.\nLose.\n\n\"I'd like to begin again.\"\nFashion.\n\nFate.\nBelieve.\n\nWhat's the funniest thing that's been said to you after sharing the mic?\n'I like dinosaur dick.' It was awkward. Me and [DJ] Cash looked at each other like, what the fuck. We need to get a drop that goes 'what the fuck' just for times when people say something stupid!\n\nIf you ask God for bread first, what do you ask him for second?\nSecondly, I'd just ask Him for happiness.\n\nWhat was for breakfast?\nWe have bagel shops in New York that make really, really good bagels. I had egg whites on an Everything Bagel\u2026toasted. It was delicious!\n\nWhat would I witness if I opened up your fridge tonight? [Kish places me on a brief hold as she makes her way to the refrigerator.] Water, garlic, corn on the cob, carrots, apples, Sweet Leaf iced tea, teriyaki sauce and vegetables!\n\nSurely, most recent graduates of the Fashion Institute of Technology don't expect to spend their first unbound summer exploring the real world whilst touring the country and performing original records alongside a percentage of the Odd Future collective, The Internet, consisting of Matthew Martians and Syd tha Kyd. Fine arts enthusiast Lakisha Robinson, however, has never been like most people. According to her, she's simply \"a person who likes to make stuff, design things and be busy. I just like to make a bunch of different things and see where it goes.\" From creating a custom denim bracelet business in high school to concocting ideas for visual treatments, concert invitations and album covers, Kish is a modern day renaissance woman- solely guided by her unbound imagination and secure grasp of how imperative it is to simply do it- yourself.\n\nWhat's your favorite flower?\nThe daffodil.\n\nIs that what you painted when putting together your portfolio for FIT?\nMy portfolio was so bad. I literally forgot I had a portfolio meeting, so I just put together a bunch of shit that I had in my room. Mine wasn't mounted, mine wasn't all the same sizes\u2026 Everybody came with finished drawings, and I just came with all the shit I could find in my room. I brought it to them, and they were just like, 'This is really good stuff, but could you not put it in another school's envelope next time?' Needless to say, I got in the school. It's really easy to get into FIT\u2026\n\nWhat makes up your wardrobe?\nI basically wear the same thing every day. Cutoff shorts or black jeans, and a really comfortable t-shirt. I have these T-shirts from John Varvatos that I really, really, really, really love that are super thin. Jeans, I usually just buy from Rag & Bone. I buy the exact same pair of jeans every year. They're always black. Then I wear Dr. Marten shoes that don't ever break, so I just keep wearing them. Sometimes I wear Converse\u2026white or black\u2026 I make my own cutoff jean shorts. Unica has the best denim because they're cheap jeans that you just cut and they're always perfect. I buy them to cut them\u2026\n\nYour natural, wild hairstyle seems to conjoin perfectly with your image. Could you see yourself branding an alternate version of Kinky Curly instead of typically investing your music money into a clothing line or liqueur?\nWell, I'm not really into hair and beauty stuff. I really suck when it comes to stuff like that. I wouldn't make an urban clothing line ever, but I do think that I'd enjoy designing apparel. I really like designing menswear and home products, actually. Those are the two things that are most important to me. I can see myself doing that, or making a lot of weird shit like mugs, candles and rugs. I'm building a loom in my house, so my friend and I are going to start making rugs. I feel like people aren't inventive enough when it comes to the stuff they'd like to make. They just make T-shirts and that's it. I made a merch tee, but that's just because people like t-shirts. I'm trying to find a way to make all of my prints so that people can actually see that I'm actually good at designing. I'll definitely be making a lot of things other than music, always.\n\nDo you have any hair styling advice that you can offer women who'd like to give the natural look a try?\nDefinitely don't shampoo your hair everyday. You can condition it every day, though. I don't really comb my hair that much, but I definitely try to get the knots out when I'm in the shower. I also put olive oil [from the kitchen] in my hair a lot. It makes your hair super light in the summertime\u2026if you like that kind of thing.\n\nSo you just venture out to the kitchen, grab a bottle of olive oil and\u2026\n- and I just put it in my hair, yeah! In the shower. It also makes your skin really soft, too- if you just let it drizzle down\u2026\n\nI usually just put it in boiling water when making spaghetti.\nIt's really good for your hair and your skin- in the summertime. I tried the same during winter and it just made my hair clumpy and gross. Also, I have separate groups of hair products that change with the seasons. It's good to switch it up sometimes so that your hair doesn't get used to one thing.\n\nKilo Kish's original plan was to take a stand against everybody deeming themselves an \"artist.\" Unfortunately fortunately, her efforts are the exact reason she's standing on stage at this moment- imitating those she loathed. Pursuing a musical career began as a joke amongst friends that led Kish to the creation of her first EP, Homeschool, which naturally became the catalyst that spiraled her smack dab into a life of subtle stardom and high demand. Within months of its release, many began to seek out the soft-spoken songstress, inevitably leading to alliances with acts such as Childish Gambino, The Internet, and Flatbush Zombies.\n\nIf you could be locked in the studio with 3 people for a week- dead or alive, who would you choose?\nI'd probably kill myself if I were locked in the studio for a week. I hate being in there. It's like a hospital to me. I don't ever want to go to a place where musicians go to work and hits are made. I don't like being in places where I feel pressured. I prefer to work in a smaller space. I like to record all of my songs at home first so that when I go to the studio I already know exactly what I have to do when I get there. I can just knock it out without thinking about it\u2026Just get in and get out. I don't mind going to the studio for other people, though\u2026\n\nHow does one get on a record with Kilo Kish?\nI'm super interested in people's vibes. I'll do a song if I like it for whatever reason. It may be the beat, it may be this, it may be that\u2026I might not have ever heard any of your music before that point, because you may not be the most popping person- or you might be the most relevant person ever\u2026it all depends on if I actually like the song, and if I actually like you as a person. Even with Donald, we hung out a lot before we worked together.\n\nWhat's your most memorable moment with Donald Glover?\nFirst of all, when I performed at Prospect Park with him the entire crowd just scowled at me. His fans are insane. They were just giving me the worst looks ever as we performed our new song [Make it Go Right]. The people that I actually made eye contact with did not fuck with me. After our performance, he looked on his Twitter and some girl sent him a message calling me a \"basic bitch.\" We died laughing, and he just kept calling me a basic bitch for the remainder of the night. It was hilarious!\n\n\"I'm going to have a seat with you guys.\" Midway through the performance, Kilo Kish lowers herself to the ground and sits Indian-style amongst her front row viewers before she begins the next song. Though her first time gracing Atlanta's narrow, uneven streets, Kish displays a calm, comfortable demeanor as if she were returning home for the second time. Formerly introduced to signature ATLien bass infused booty beats by her best friend and manager Justin Scott [A.$.A.P. Snacks], Kilo Kish is no stranger to the city's bounce. She's even admitted to her music and moniker being slightly influenced by the city's own Kilo Ali. She tells MTV, \"I just listened to [Organized Bass] the other day because I was thinking of different drops and what I wanted to play if I had a DJ set before my show, and I'm like 'We have to play Kilo Ali,' so I was finding different Kilo Ali songs and I was like 'Wow, it actually goes with the set, which is crazy.\"\n\nWhat would be your perfect 90\u2032s band reunion concert?\nI'd love to see the Spice Girls reunite, but that's not really R&B. I'd really like to see a trio of Tyrese, Ginuwine and Carl Thomas. I just want to hear him sing Emotional\u2026 like twice. I really, really, really would like to see a B2K show\u2026 and Pretty Ricky. Together. I've never been to a Scream Tour, because I wasn't into it as much then, but I miss boy bands so much. I saw 'NSync when I was little, though. That was good. We had crazy seats that were really far away, but it was amazing to see Justin Timberlake when I was younger. We kinda have the same hair\u2026\n\nWhat's your favorite Micheal Jackson video? Leave Me Alone. Wait, that's my second favorite! My favorite is Speed Demon- the one with all the clay figures. The whole entire Moonwalker movie also amazes me. I have them all taped. I have an entire catalog of old VHS tapes that say 'Kish's Micheal Jackson Tapes' in my 9-year-old handwriting.\n\nI hear that you just recently obtained a passport. If given a chance to finally travel anywhere outside of the country, where would you go first, and what 3 things would you HAVE to bring?\nI'm so bad at Geography. I want to go to Australia- minus the really, really long plane ride. I'd bring J. Scott or Cash, because I don't like to travel alone. A camera. Or a notebook or sketchbook. Oh, and money!\n\nSetbacks can sometimes become the befitting set up for a comeback. Approximately a year ago, Matt Martians was forced to reside at Justin Scott's apartment due to the loss of his wallet during an Odd Future concert. It was there where Kish first met Matt and was able to randomly play a couple of her songs for him. Though she can't recall the exact song that struck his interest, she realizes that this night may have been the prelude to her musical successes. She also realizes that if it weren't for a couple of perfectly imperfect unplanned inconveniences, she would have never been in the wrong place at the right time in the first place.\n\nWhat was the catalyst to your hiatus from college, and what prompted your return?\nI never wanted to take a year off, but my financial aid at Pratt [Institute] was screwed up during my second year and I didn't have a chance to fix it in time for school to start. My mom asked if I wanted to come home or stay in New York, and I told her there was no way that I was returning to Florida. So, I decided to just I take a year off from school and stay with my manager [Justin Scott] because he had an extra room in his apartment. That was the same year that I met Smash Simmons and started making music. That entire year I was searching for something because I was so angry that I couldn't be in school doing what I wanted to do. Instead of designing, I was working these regular retail jobs that fucking sucked. When I came home, I'd just do music to escape. After that year my financial aid was back in order and I went to FIT instead. I always wanted to be in school, but had I not taken that year off I wouldn't have ever met Smash or even started making music. I guess it was a good thing\u2026it was actually awesome. Now I definitely recommend people taking a year off, because it kinda gets your head straight on what you actually want to do.\n\nWhy did you stay in New York? Many people would have taken the easy route and fled!\nI hate quitting. It's a really big pet peeve of mine. I will never quit anything. Ever. Even if it sucks really bad, I just won't quit. I mean, I quit jobs if I have another better job and things like that. But I don't quit things because I don't like them or because it's hard. I also like being independent and being on my own. Once you're on your own, it's kind of hard to go back to being in someone else's house and stuff. It's like when you're dating a dude with a car, you can't really go back to dating a guy without one because you got so used to it. Or, like a dating a guy with his own apartment for the first time. You're like, Oh my God, this is awesome. You just can't date a dude that lives at his mom's anymore.\n\nWhat kinds of lessons are included in the curriculum of Homeschool?\nIt's kind of creepy how much time I spend by myself. I really like to sit at my house- that has no television, and I just write, think about things, listen to music, make art and design stuff. I spend a lot of time alone. It's really comforting for me while being in New York- which is such a big city that can potentially eat you alive if you let it. I kind of take being at home as a place to regroup and think about my next move, and what people have texted me that day. It's kind of a place that I can figure myself out and what I'm doing. Homeschool curriculum consists of life lessons taught by yourself.\n\nDon't you ever get lonely? Bored?\nNo. If I don't spend enough time alone, I get really weird. I need a lot of alone time. It's crazy. People are like, 'Hey\u2026what are you doing? 'And I'm like, 'I'm at home.' They ask what I'm doing and I say, 'Oh, nothing.' Then they ask me to come over, and I decline. I'm the queen of skipping out. I'm just like, 'Yeah, okay\u2026I'm just going to go\u2026and do this,' but I just go home and be by myself. I'm giving away all of my lies right now! I get bored easily, but it's very rare for me to become bored with myself. I'm weird and anti-social, but when I'm out I'm really social. I just need a certain amount of time to myself.\n\nCan anything you learned while studying textile design be applied to life?\nLife is kind of like a puzzle. You're trying to make stuff fit. Fabrics or prints are supposed to essentially go on forever without repeats or mistakes or anything like that. You have to do a lot of drafts before you get things right. In life, you have to try things more than once before do them correctly sometimes\u2026\n\nCan we expect a new Homeschool visual or EP by the end of the year?\nYep yep yep, you can! I've been debating about putting out the Homeschool visuals because I'm moving on to new projects. I'm kind of anti-video in general, because sometimes you see things in your head that you can't translate to people who is supposed to be helping me make videos\u2026\n\nKish closes the show with BusBoy- an ode to the wants of girls and women alike, produced by The Super 3 (Hal Williams and Matthew Martians). \"Girls hate it when you don't respond\/ Girls hate it when you live with mom\/ girls hate it when your phone don't quit\/ girls hate it when you're on some shit\u2026\" As surrounding ladies began to smirk in unison, gentlemen shift uncomfortably. This isn't Kish's first display of emotional vulnerability. She shares a tale of heartbreak, deceit and comedic revenge on Julienne, and also frees herself from the confines of denial and self-blame on You're Right, concocted by Syd Tha Kyd.\n\nOn Boy, You gave us a long list of things that girls hate, and reasons why they don't call. Can you enlighten us gentlemen on an age-old inquiry that has stumped us for decades- what DO girls like? What DO girls want?\nWe want everything! Girls want everything. Like\u2026everything. There's no better way to put it. We want you to call, but not too much. We want you to be around, but not all the time. We want you to pay attention, but not too much. Girls want everything. It's just finding the perfect balance of\u2026everything. I'm sure girls can say a lot of things that they don't like. It's easier to make a list of what we don't like. I couldn't write a song about all of the things I did like.\n\nWas You're Right inspired by true events?\nThat was probably one of the only songs that actually had something that inspired it. I actually wrote that song the day that my boyfriend and I broke up\u2026in my room, and I recorded it at my house. It's the only song on the tape that I actually recorded at my house while everything else was recorded at a real studio. It was kind of like our situation. All the other songs are a little more spacy, introspective and thoughtful, but that one was most to the point. It was actually a quote from him. He used to be like, 'If we break up or whatever all I have are my friends\u2026I really don't consider you one of my friends\u2026or the people that I have\u2026' and it kinda just went from there. That relationship was one of those where the guy really considered his friends super super important, and kind of put his girlfriend as an afterthought. I guess you were right. We're not together, and your friends are all you've got. Some of my songs are really all over the place- like Navy, but when I write songs that are more relatable it comes off as if it's more from the heart.\n\nWhat are the top 3 things on your FuckIt List?\nThe first thing on my FuckIt list is trying to keep up with hair, nails and beauty routines. I tried once before, and I'm so bad at it. Women who have time to make sure that they look good all of the time amaze me. I tried, but I can't. A week will go by and I'll think about going to get my nails done, but\u2026won't. For a while I was doing it, you know- getting my hair cut all the time, doing my eyebrows\u2026but after a while, I'm just like\u2026fuck it.\n\nThe second thing on my FuckIt list is entertaining stupid conversations. I actually don't like networky conversations when it's only about gaining something or another from each other besides conversation and friendship. My DJ [Cash] is really, really good at entertaining people's bullshit, but I'm not. I'll just walk away in the middle of the conversation. If you'd like to talk to me about random stuff like what's going on in your life, that's awesome. But if it has anything to do with work, I don't want to talk about it. I spend a lot of time by myself, so when I do make friends- they're genuinely friends\u2026and if we happen to work together, we just happen to work together.\n\nThe last thing on my FuckIt list is being nice to cab drivers. I get really, really annoyed when cab drivers don't want to take you certain places. Like, that's your job, dude! That's one thing that I can rant on forever about. I've met some that are amazing, and I've also met some that have literally cursed me out in the street to my face- like screaming in my face, and we're about to fight. Cab drivers\u2026fuck you if you don't want to take someone where they need to go when they want to go there. Especially when you're on a late shift!\n\nWhy wouldn't they want to go?!\nSometimes they just don't want to be bothered. I remember one time I wanted to go to 147th street, but they just dropped me wherever. They're like, 'Actually the traffic is bad on that street. I'm just going to drop you like four blocks away from where I said I would. It's a short walk. You can walk, right?' I'm like, 'No! Fuck you!' Luckily, I live in a good place where it isn't really an issue for me anymore, but I remember when I lived a little bit deeper in Brooklyn and it was tough. Especially on Saturday or a night where you work late.\n\nWhy don't you just bolt on them?\nNo, no. Even if I fight with them, I leave the fare. Actually, I've told them to let me out of the cab before if they're being super assholes by screaming at me and talking shit, I'm like, 'Let me get out.' And they're like, 'No\u2026I'm going to take you where you need to go.' I'm like, 'No get me the fuck out of the cab.' And they're like, 'No, I'm going to take you. I'm going to take you where you need to go.' And I'm like, 'No. Let me out now. I'll pay you for where we've gone, but if you don't let me out now, I'm just going to jump out of the cab.' I definitely pay- even if it's not where I need to go. I feel like everybody deserves to be paid for the jobs that they do.\n\nIt's last call and you're down to your last $10. Whatcha' drinking?\nI can't really drink sweet drinks because I just get sick. I like to drink Patron on the rocks with a lime, or a vodka and [club] soda. I also drink white wine. I like some beers, too. Like Stella [Artois]\u2026\n\nDo you have any inspiring words for anybody who may aspire to be in your position?\nJust do you. Do whatever works for you. Don't copy others, just stay in your lane without worrying about what others are doing. Stay true to your own personality. Do what you want when you want to do it. That's what I've done thus far. I'm not concerned with putting out a different song or mix tape every day. I don't want to put out songs just to put them out, or just to make people listen to them. I want to put out songs because I want to put them out. I'm definitely taking my time with things- even if that means not being the person that everybody's looking at every two seconds. I don't need all the attention all the time. It's cool to do things on my own, like doing shows when I want to do them- instead of doing them because I know people would come.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nCurrently you have JavaScript disabled.

{"text":"Gorillaz Break Up\n\nWhen Damon Albarn went on BBC2 last week and told an interviewer that he wouldn't be making another pop album with the Gorillaz, he only really proved one thing: Damon Albarn is a fucking idiot. I never particularly liked the Gorillaz' two albums, but I had to admire Albarn's unlikely coup. A lot of aging pop stars gradually grow deeply uncomfortable with the spotlight and look for ways to disappear from the attention that mass adulation brings. It's a cliche. But Albarn managed to figure out a way to disappear that somehow allowed him to sell more records than he had when he was an actual pop star. In the UK, Albarn had spent most of the 90s as a bona fide celebrity, feuding with Oasis and enduring a drawn-out tabloid-fueled breakup with Elastica's Justine Frischmann; he led the sort of life that could understandably make someone want to drop out of the pop-culture game for good. In America, though, Blur were culty imports who managed to go gold once on the strength of \"Song 2,\" a fluke accidental jock-jam. So it's pretty amazing that Albarn's self-consciously goofy and deconstructionist pop-art project managed to go platinum in America with its self-titled debut album, and it's even more amazing that that Demon Days, the second Gorillaz album, managed to go double-plat here at a time when nobody was buying music. Albarn pulled off a rare trick: he took his pop-star alienation all the way to the bank. And now he's giving up on it. Maybe this guy doesn't know how good he has it.\n\nIt's a little implausible to talk about the breakup of an imaginary cartoon band, especially since Albarn is apparently the only actual full-time member of the Gorillaz and he can revive the name anytime he feels like it. Albarn worked with a completely different set of musical collaborators for the two Gorillaz albums, though both of those albums ended up functionally sounding pretty much the same. Tank Girl illustrator Jamie Hewlett, who draws the ugly-ass Gorillaz mascots, has been around for both records, but given that he doesn't seem to write or play any of the music I'm not going to call him a member of the group. Instead, Albarn has taken advantage of the project's general anonymity to scrounge his rolodex for wish-list collaborators: Del, Ibrahim Ferrer, Shaun Ryder, Ike Turner, Neneh Cherry. He hired Dan the Automator to produce the first album and Danger Mouse, the updated 2005 version of Automator, to produce the second. And he stayed off in the wings the entire time, never appearing in Gorillaz videos and only occasionally taking the stage with\/for the group. Rather than actual humans, Gorillaz live shows had the band's cartoon likenesses playing on big movie screens while the real live musicians hid behind them and played their music in the dark. A while ago, there was some talk of a Gorillaz arena tour featuring holograms, and I can just imagine what a glorious mess that might've been. I saw the Gorillaz last year at the Apollo, and their big movie screen was busted, but Albarn still stayed hidden, singing his parts off on the wings of the stage and only allowing himself to be glimpsed during the final song of the evening.\n\nAlbarn did pretty much everything he could to deflect attention from himself, including inventing a long and tedious backstory for the cartoon band. It was a cheesy hook, certainly, but it snared a lot of record-buyers and resulted in some weird culture-clash moments, like the time the Gorillaz and De La Soul gave the opening performance at the Grammys last year, immediately disappearing when Madonna took the stage afterwards. Both Gorillaz albums are full of lazy, stoned, half-finished songs, each album only boasting a handful of decent hooks, so it seems pretty likely that the project's gimmicky image and backstory are what sold it those millions. Last year, Nick Sylvestercalled Gnarls Barkley \"a fascinating instance where the publicists and publicity engines and all the mechanisms of the business of music are more artistic than the music itself,\" and it seems fair to say that Danger Mouse must've picked up a few tricks from his time as Albarn's hired gun.\n\nAnd so now Albarn's sick of it, or maybe not; he never likes giving straight answers in interviews. But here's what he told BBC2: \"There won't be another pop record.\" Instead, he's working on a film score for the full-length Gorillaz movie, which will apparently somehow involve noted loon Terry Gilliam. I can't imagine anyone ever wanting to go see a full-length Gorillaz movie, but then Albarn has managed to make hard sells pay off before. In any case, he's beginning to sound like the Beastie Boys' Adam Yaunch around the time he discovered Buddha and decided he wanted to quit rapping. And after all, money isn't everything. Maybe Albarn is having too much fun with his new band, the Good, the Bad and the Queen, which wastes the fantastical rhythm section of Paul Siminon and Tony Allen on a depressive song-cycle of drizzly, beatless pub-rock chamber-hymns. Maybe he wants to get back to writing actual songs; I'm not convinced he's managed to finish one since Blur's \"Tender.\" Or maybe he's just sick of the whole Gorillaz enterprise. He wouldn't be the only one.\n\nMore About:Ndl3\n\nI would tottaly like to see a Gorillaz movie :) <3 I love their stories and I think that it could be a cool and popular film, the Gorillaz are actually very popular ;) I can't say that I am a fan of this cartoon band, but I think that it is an original and really really cool band! :) I like the characters and their life story, I especially like 2-D :D <3\n\nDude ur review is lousy. You have a good knack of saying the bad parts of Gorillaz and never mentioning one good aspect.\nIf the Gorillaz are so lousy then why are they extremely popular? Their albums are incredible if u actually pay attention. Demon Days would have to be my most favorite of albums.\nPersonally, i would love to see the Gorillaz movie, both virtual and the real life members.\nBad review man, try to know Gorillaz a little more b4 u do something like this\n\nnooo they just can't im nothing without the gorillaz !!!!:( they mean my whole fucking world to me Damon Albarn fucking a total hater without the gorillaz im not going to live !!!! i'll fucking kill myself :( :( :(\n\nI appreciate that you've got your reasons. But here's the thing- I'm beginning to think he might actually be more of a producer than a beatmaker.\n\nAs a beatmaker alone, wins That says something about him.\n\nI appreciate that you've got your reasons. But here's the thing- I'm beginning to think he might actually be more of a producer than a beatmaker.\n\nAs a beatmaker wins There's something to be said for that.\n\nI will certainly continue to keep an eye out for him, I think its clear, despite my language, that I don't dismiss things outright, I had \"reasons\". Making hits songs doesn't necessarily make you good though, very odd logic. Has Dangermouse made anything as good as 'The Listening'? We can always compare and contrast.\n\nFor me, all the projects listed do indeed sound like DM, I wouldn't pass their success off as not being related to him, I just find all of those projects similarly weak-sounding and safe. He just seems more like a beat-maker than a producer, you know?\n\nGive Dangermouse time. He could still wind up being a big force in music equivalant to timbaland.\n\nHe isnt an instrumentalist, he relies on a lot of samples, and he works with a lot of talented people that people can throw the success of his projects on...but his track record is really consistent. Even that dangerdoom album was good if kind of boring.\n\nThe Grey Album...ehh..it's like Gnarls and the DangerDoom stuff, all cutesy gimmicks, basically bullshit. He's this gimmicky producer that, on top of the gimmicks, makes really soft, light-weight beats; I think the 9th Wonder comparison I made is pretty dead-on. I sort of like 9th Wonder it's just...they aren't any thing special.\n\nI will meet you half way on the Gnarls thing; most of the album is a joke. \"Crazy\" would probably still be great without Danger Mouse, but I think he makes it better. I was definetly being hyberpolic about comparing Danger Mouse to Timbaland, you're right. But third rate? I would say he's definetly in the top rung of DJ\/producers. The Grey Album speaks for itself.\n\nI would say 'Crazy' would be a really great song if not for Danger Mouse's boring, borderline trip-hop drums he lays over it. Otherwise, the song would be a cool, Thom Bell-esque soul throwback. There's a live version I saw on youtube that KILLS because you can only hear the strings and stuff, it ends up just being like a Cee-Lo solo track which are...pretty good, nothing great. As for the rest of that Gnarls album, its a joke in every way.\n\nKudler-I don't drool over 3-6 I just think they are good. Dangermouse is third-rate though, really, only someone whose ear is broken would think otherwise. Comparing him to Timbaland? Not even close on any level, he's closer to 9th Wonder or something.\n\nI have no idea how anyone can call Gnarls Barkley \"awful.\" \"Crazy\" is a great song anyway you slice it, over saturated, yah, but great non-the-less. I don't understand how you can drool over 3-6 and call Gnarls Barkley awful; is it just because non-music snobs love them for the \"right reasons\"? I don't want to be a dick, but it seems like a big factor in picking your tastes is who else likes them. As for Danger Mouse: man is a genius, straight up. Same way Timbaland is --not of the same caliber but in the same fashion. I mean that Sparkelhorse album would've been weak without him, but it was awesome; Gray Album, amazing, Gnarls Barkely solidly great. The man has his hands in so many projects and most of them are really good. Just admit you like Gnarls Barkely or at least \"Crazy!\"\n\nCome on now, Brandon. \"Awful\" kinda smacks of critical backlash. You're right that sincerity isn't really what either, umm, artist (?) is going for, but I don't think I want to know where a sincerity-contest leads. I don't ever find myself reaching for any of the three albums in question, but I'd say they're functionally mediocre. They go over well in mixed company and I can at least tolerate (and occasionally enjoy) them. That counts for something.\n\nI agree that Albarn is a frustrating songwriter, but I feel that you're insulting Danger Mouse just for the sake of it. I thought the first album was quite inconsistent, but the second album is a near perfect pop record, which is almost completely due to Danger Mouse's production. Also, do you really think Gnarls Barkley was a product of marketing more than quality? Compared Gnarls to Ashlee Simpson, or Avril Lavigne. How many other underground rap, neo-soul alternative rock bands do you see going gold, or bands that could write \"Crazy,\" \"Necromancer,\" and cover \"Gone Daddy Gone\" on the same album (and do a better job on that song than the Violent Femmes). I admit to getting upset at hype more than the product as well, but you seem to let it get the best of you here. Granted, it's why your blog is named what it isYeah, Tom! Right the fuck on! An artist who's always (for better and worse) followed his creative muse, who's consistently split his attention between multiple projects, and who had made boatloads of money a decade ago is a total fucking idiot for not churning out another Gorillaz record now that it's a cash cow.\n\nAnd good on you for shitting on his body of work for the past decade (though points for condescending to admit your admiration for his artistic concept\/marketing scheme), going so far as to (half-jokingly? let's hope) blame him for Danger Mouse's \"keep it interesting for 2:10 and I'm out\" approach.\n\nRough post. Luckily, I hear Timbaland farted last week. I look forward to your breakdown of the remix tomorrow. Maybe he can get Bjork to Bjurp on it???\n\nWow. I'm guessing you didn't actually listen to the second Gorillaz album if you're willing to say they both ended up \"sounding pretty much the same.\" The first was a lot more of mood piece. Sketchy tracks with dub beats. The second was a really polished piece.\n\nAnyway, calling one of the most creative musicians of the past 15 years an \"idiot\" because he refuses to keep himself tied to one thing does nothing but make you look foolish."}
{"text":"Black Eyes and White Lies\n\n(Howler; US: 7 Feb 2006; UK: 13 Feb 2006)\n\nThe Witnesses: Black Eyes and White Lies\n\nRock and Roll is Dead, All Praise Rock and Roll!\n\nI was strangely disappointed, upon learning that the band the Academy Is (formerly known as simply the Academy) were going to be showcased on M2 as a hot, new band. Of all the artists that I've reviewed, I think they might have been the most forgettable, a generic emo-rock band incapable of coming up with any melody or idea that hadn't been done a thousand times before.\n\nAs this knowledge sunk in, I began thinking about those rare occasions where I had the pleasure of reviewing something that I felt was truly great, and how those releases never seemed to pan out. Marianne Faithfull's Before the Poison failed to reach a single year's best list, and Robyn Hitchcock's gorgeous alt-country album Spooked came and went like it never even was released. Where was the iPod commercial featuring Jennifer Gentle's bizarre and brilliant pop oddity \"I Do Dream You\"? Why hadn't even the general indie press given any notice to Nanook of the North's The Taby Tapes or even given a shout-out to Postal Blue's melancholy bossa-nova inspired ballads? For the first time, I wondered if some strange prejudices were deceiving me about the quality of the music I was listening to, and I began to wonder if I were giving people inflated impressions.\n\nIf there's one band that I've found myself liking and praising more than my head tells me to, it's New York City's Witnesses. I praise their every release like it's the second (or sixteenth) coming of straight-forward rock and roll, even though a part of me tells me that they really aren't any more imaginative than the Academy Is. Sure, there's some great rock songs on Black Eyes and White Lies, but are they really that good? Aren't they just another New York rock and roll act with a female singer and a barrage of old school riffs? On my third evaluation of their talents, shouldn't I just lay low and damn them with faint praise?\n\nFortunately for me, Black Eyes and White Lies is such a powerful record, an incredible leap from their debut Tunnel Vision, that it dispelled any of my doubts about the Witnesses' worth. While commenting on their early releases, I think I liked the Witnesses because I wanted to like the Witnesses. On the new album, the band takes their glam\/grunge sound and applies it to material that matches its image, and even occasionally works a little outside their relatively narrow niche. \"Be Straight with Me\" starts with a long, ecstatic guitar solo designed to piss off anyone who was looking for a punk\/post-punk band, as the extended song goes into refreshingly uncool classic rock detours. Better still is the terse, keyboard driven \"Stockholm Syndrome\" where Bonnie Bloomgarden switches tone from high speed rawk into beautiful, midtempo paranoia. Her vocals also fuel the similarly moody \"Rocks\" and \"Dead Wood\", which provide a more varied pop landscape for the Witnesses.\n\nStill, the Witnesses, at their heart, are all about pure rock and roll, which is aided by the fact that they have a male\/female vocal pair with Bloomgarden and guitarist Oakley Munson that somehow survives comparisons to John Doe and Exene Cervenka. The Witnesses debuted \"Hard Up\" on a limited edition eponymous EP last year, but the track works even better as the zero-to-a-hundred opening blast, the lyrics are standard boy-girl stuff, and I'm sure you could name thousands of other songs that followed the same basic pattern, but when Bloomgarden and Munson come together on the chorus, the song becomes so big and powerful that it can't be written off as old hat.\n\nIn fact, to call the Witnesses \"old hat\" would be tantamount to calling rock music \"old hat\". Then again, that may be an apt phrase to use in describing rock music. I don't think I've had a single conversation about music when I didn't mention that rock and roll, as a popular media, is dying, and that fairly soon it will mainly be listened to by devoted followers, much like jazz is today. I don't want to believe it, my heart doesn't believe it, but I fear that it's due to happen fairly soon, perhaps within a decade or so. Certainly rock music will transform into something else, and survive in its mutated form (much like what happened to Rhythm & Blues, although hopefully not as sad and pathetic). Again this is what my head believes, but when the Witnesses start it describing a \"Summer of Blood\", my heart refuses to believe it. My heart tells me there's still something vital about listening to a group of young people play electric guitars and scream into a microphone about love and partying, but mostly nothing in particular.\n\nAm I allowing myself to be duped again by the Witnesses? Should I just concede the remaining history of rock music to the freeze-dried, tuneless, and unforgivably ignorable likes of the Academy Is, Fall Out Boy, and All-American Rejects, like how the jazz lovers just frowned and turned off the radio with the advent of smooth jazz? I don't know right now, and I don't care. \"Summer of Blood\" is blasting from my speakers and I absolutely love it, and that, not Billboard chart positions or mentions in Rolling Stone or Magnet or even PopMatters, is what matters, when it comes down to it."}

{"text":"Art of Dying Premiere Acoustic Version of \"Die Trying\"\n\nHard rockers Art of Dying released their debut, Vices and Virtues (Intoxication), earlier this year. The group, which will be heading out on the Rockstar Uproar tour in August, plays a special acoustic version of the album's first song, \"Die Trying,\" below. Frontman Jonny HetheringtonDie Trying\" about? JONNY HETHERINGTON \"Die Trying\" is really the personal story of our band. Starting from nothing, following our dream, and doing whatever it takes to get where we want to be. It's about never giving up. Figuring out what you want and fully committing yourself is very powerful, but it's a lot harder than it seems. I mean, it's easy to say \"I'll do what ever it takes\u2026 I want this,\" but actually living the struggle day by day, year by year is another thing. It's not a 90-minute film with a montage, it's real life. You sacrifice so much to truly put everything you have into your dream and it's fucking hard\u2026 but I think it's worth it. Even if you don't get there, you died trying, and I think that's a pretty killer way to live.\n\nWhich part of it did you come up with first?\nGreg brought the riff and the meat of the song to me and we worked on the music together on acoustic guitars. The lyrics came to me pretty quickly in the following days. We had a former manager pass away around that time and I wanted to honor him with a song. His name was Jeff \"Ffroe\" Roe and he was truly a dreamer. I always remembered his email signature and mantra which was, \"If you don't try, you'll never know.\" And that really inspired the pre-chorus line \"I'd rather fail than not know.\"\n\nHow did you come up with this acoustic arrangement?\nI do a lot of my best work on the porcelain throne. You'd be surprised at the number of songs on Vices and Virtues that were originated in the can. I love messing around with different acoustic versions of our songs in different tunings. I play in drop B, so I've got a lot of room to jump up the frets with a capo, which is exactly how this version of \"Die Trying\" came to be. I threw the capo on the second fret and rediscovered the song in a new key. It's a really nice place for the vocals to sit for an acoustic version. It's actually higher than the original version which allows me to sing the chorus in a lower register but still with some juice behind it. I took it to the guys and we worked together on it in the studio in Chicago with engineer Matt Doughrety. It came together really naturally and we nailed the tempo, allowing it to sway a little more than the plugged-in version. It kind a makes you want to drink rum.\n\nWhat sort of feedback have you gotten on this song so far?\nWe get a lot of mail saying it's become a personal theme for people which is pretty amazing. There's really nothing more rewarding for me as a musician than to have a song actually resonate and to feel that connection.\n\nWhen's the last time you thought to yourself, \"I'm going to get this done, or die trying?\" What were you doing?\nThere are the big battles in life, but there are the little ones too, the daily ones.

The group's latest album, Seeds, doesn't break any new ground, but its simplicity in making music sets it apart. Each video up on YouTube has views well into the hundreds of thousands, but production values teetering closer to the hundreds of dollars. Instead of making Hey Rosetta look bush league, this lo-fi aesthetic comes off charming and likable. Even the videos that look professionally made have an inviting nature, which is an underrated quality in this age of streaming video and instant judgments. This is a rare case of a band's personality making it infinitely more noteworthy."}
{"text":"Youth Lagoon Exposed in Pitchfork Interview\n\nYouth Lagoon Exposed in Pitchfork Interview\n\nTrevor Powers was barely 20 years old when he recorded his Alternative record \"The Year of Hibernation\" under the name Youth Lagoon. The album was well received as a masterfully crafted indie success, and Powers went to Pitchfork to discuss his upcoming sophomore album \"Wondrous Bughouse.\"\n\nPitchfork: Judging from the song titles on the record, like \"Daisyphobia\", \"Attic Doctor\", \"Mute\", and \"Sleep Paralysis\", a lot of it seems to be about either death or frailty of the body.\n\nTrevor Powers: Definitely. \"Dropla\", for instance, is about the idea of watching someone close to you pass away. We never think that kind of stuff happens; we just kind of live in disillusion.\n\nPitchfork: Are those songs more about your own worries about mortality or seeing what's going on around you?\n\nTP: Even with the name Wondrous Bughouse\u2013 the \"bughouse\" is an old term that refers to an insane asylum, so the title is just welcoming the beauty of the idea of being conscious of our mortality. I really got consumed with the idea of how people who are deemed crazy or insane often have a firmer grasp on reality than normal people. The average person goes through life thinking it will go on forever. We say to ourselves we won't live forever, but I don't think that thought ever really sinks in until the day comes. A lot of it is me being scared that one day I'll die, just realizing that. Even during the recording of the album I had this anxiety of thinking I was going to die for some reason. I kept trying to push it off but it kept coming back. It was super overwhelming.\n\nPitchfork: Listening to the new songs, one thing I noticed immediately that carried over from Hibernation is how the tracks really open up at a high volume. Is it a conscious decision for you to make records that sound better loud despite their hermetic nature?\n\nTP: It's mainly because music is often put off as a background thing nowadays. So the whole concept of having something really in-your-face that you're forced to listen to is beautiful because I think music should be an event and not something that's just dismissed.\n\nPitchfork: Who are your inspirations in terms of people that make confrontational music that isn't considered typically loud or abrasive?\n\nTP: When I first started writing this record, I started listening to a lot of This Heat's Repeat\u2013 it's so drawn out that a lot of people would just dismiss it as background music, but for me it had this whole otherworldliness to it. As far as music being something that's not background, it doesn't mean that it's loud, it means that it's instantly something to dwell on and process and swallow and regurgitate. I've always been a big fan of Brian Eno and Harold Budd, too.\n\nPitchfork: Do you think being from a place such as Boise as opposed to Brooklyn or Los Angeles leads to the possibility that music is seen as more of an important social experience because of its rarity?\n\nTP: Yeah. When friends and I go to shows around here, everyone goes for a purpose rather than just going to hang out. In a lot of cities there's music so often that none of it really sinks in, which takes the whole event factor out of it. When bands come to Boise, you really want to listen to them.\n\nCheck out the video for the song \"Montana\" from Youth Lagoon's first album \"The Year of Hibernation\" below.

Dee Dee has a very pleasant voice; the sweet pop harmonies and fuzzy vocals and guitars played well together, putting them somewhere between The Shangri-Las and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Dee Dee stared straight ahead most of the time and there was minimal banter with the intimate crowd, and the group tore through almost all the short songs on their album (the average length of the songs are about two and a half minutes). The 'Girls don't move around on stage much, but overall it was a fulfilling live show filled with a great pop-punk sound and delicious, ethereal harmonies.

{"text":"The first time I listened to the new album by Norwegian Sondre Lerche, I was unimpressed. I thought it was a cheesy, overdone pop record. I was reminded of so much of the bubble gum crap that Scandinavia has become infamous for producing. It was a disappointment. It really was. For some reason, though, I persisted. There were hooks on the album that kept me coming back. I'd think, \"You know, I don't really think I like this album, but it's weird, I want to listen to it again.\" The first time you put this album on, it latches onto you. Songs get stuck in your head and rear their ugly heads when you least expect it. Next thing you know, you're singing along. It's infuriating.\n\nThis is a talent, though, and after giving it many more chances, I've concluded that Lerche's second album is actually good. It's pop music. Pure freaking pop music. I am not a huge fan of most pop music, but some of it is so intrinsically good that you can't help but get into it. It's amazing that he is in his early 20s because he has a grasp of melody well beyond his years. It's not easy to take music that is simple like this and dress it up enough to make it interesting, but Lerche does.\n\nOn tracks like \"It's Over\" and \"Maybe You're Gone,\" the drama of his life slowly unfolds. \"It's Over\" is based around his voice and simple piano chords. It's been done, right? But Lerche's lyrics are top notch and his voice is like a lullaby. It draws you in and wins you over. To increase the drama, violins and horns are added to give it an almost soap opera feel as he sings, \"We know the stars go out one night.\" Orchestrations flow in and out of the background like extras in a '40s love story. There are many film-like qualities on this record. \"Maybe You're Gone\" plays out like a person writing a Dear John letter to their now distant lover. \"I may turn around \/ to see if you're still there \/ but as for now it's just not safe,\" he sings as \"What if?\" scenarios creep up in his head. Additional instrumentation from horns and harmoniums accent his voice and electric guitar. There's remorse here, but not enough to change his mind.\n\nBut Lerche is at his best when he's sticking to upbeat, pop songs. \"Track You Down\" was the first track to weasel its way into my memory. I was lying in bed one night and just started humming it after only hearing it twice. That's how catchy it is. It sounds like it was recorded in the '70s, and it wouldn't have been out of place on the \"Boogie Nights\" soundtrack or on a Nick Drake album. Which brings up one of the most audible influences on this album. Drake had a whimsical nature to him, and Lerche has it too. When I listen to Nick Drake, I feel like I'm floating around in the clouds. It's like I'm supposed to space out. I get that same feeling from \"Two Way Monologue.\"\n\nThe title track is the best. There's a lot of energy on this song, albeit in subdued form, and when the distorted electric guitar drops in on the chorus, the song explodes. Baritone saxophones and synthesizers layer the song even more as Lerche weaves his way through a maze of wonderful lyrics. The arrangements are complex and rich in texture and tone. Never has he sounded like he's having so much fun as he does here. I would love to hear this song performed live; I imagine this scraggly Norwegian hopping around onstage like he's got an alien inside of him that he must get out. This song is the best, though, because it takes an unexpected turn in the outro. It slows down and lets the listener take a breath. Acoustic guitar and piano lull the track into near sleep state before exploding again into the chorus. The song is full of a thousand hooks, and once you really get into it, you can't help but love it. It's these moments that made me realize Lerche isn't some mediocre hack riding a huge wave of hype. He's extremely talented.\n\n\"Two Way Monologue\" trumps everything else he's put out. This is an album that artists hope to make after an already long career. It's an album that someone makes when he?s in his mid-to-late 30s, has a wife and kid, and has an epiphany one day that inspires him. It's unfathomable to me that someone younger than me wrote this, and for that I tip my hat. From the Sgt. Pepper-ish \"Days That Are Over\" to the Beach Boys-drenched \"Wet Ground,\" Lerche has created a wonderful pop record. This is someone that's truly wise beyond his years"}

{"text":"Informationen zum Artikel: Digipak CD! It's probably not the wisest commercial decision for a band that's been relevant for over 30 years to stray from the tried-and-true form that has helped them maintain their fanbase. Yet that is just what The Fuzztones have done with their newest release, Preaching To The Perverted. The Fuzztones are globally recognized as the progenitors of the Garage Rock movement, and could easily continue retreading the same ground for many years to come, but they continually choose to push the envelope. Their last album, Horny As Hell, for instance, introduced a prominent horn section, black female background vocals and a hammond organ, adding a deep Soul element to their patented Garage-Grunge. While Preaching To The Perverted continues to explore the realm of Garage Psych - and adventurously engulfs every sub genre within (Psychedelic Soul, Garage Blues, Folk Rock, Psychedelic Lounge, et al), it dares to go beyond musical proficiency and experimentation. This album contains a message - a wake-up call to the \"perverted.\" One look at the cryptic cover art and it's immediately obvious that it's not sex that the 'Tones are referring to. Lyrically, the songs (all original compositions) address many political and social issues with music that drives the message home with the urgency required. Yet while Preaching To The Perverted is, by far, The Fuzztones most mature offering, it still maintains reverence to the Garage sound the band helped to re-introduce in the 80's. Possibly the most important album the genre has ever produced."}

I am so convinced of their great purpose and leadership that I eagerly look forward to joining them in pursuit of the next Dodgers championship.\"\n\nIt's hard to believe that almost ten years have passed since The Wrens so graciously dropped The Meadowlands on us and shocked a small (at the time) generation of Pitchfork readers. As a whole, the record is a stunning achievement; a bracing, introspective look into the perils of entering your thirties with no money, no job skills, no career prospects and a dim outlook on love and friendship.\n\nReleased in 2003, The Meadowlands predates the almost overnight shift of the musical landscape by what seems like mere seconds; a shift from artists relying on major record labels to provide exposure for them to a world where artists create their own exposure and build their own hype from the ground up. But despite the record's advancing age, the songs themselves and the ideas that are formed within them feel more relevant now than ever before.\n\nIt's a miracle that a song like \"Everyone Choose Sides\" can even exist. Each line adds an angrier, more prominent \"fuck you\" to an ever-growing list of grievances. The dead-end nine to five job. The town you grew up in. The record label that dumped you. The money. The guy standing right next to you in the band. But through all of it's expressed exasperation, the song reveals the personal triumph that can arrive with examining your doubts, expressing your anger and focusing your pursuits.\n\nWe don't know how to tell you this, so we're just going to come right out and say it: Next week is going to be Police Academy Week on The A.V Club. Interviews, retrospectives, you name it. Police. Academy. Week. We're still trying to accept that this is a real thing that is happening instead of just a joke in an edit meeting.\n\nI really hope this is really real because the Police Academy movies are important to me in a way that I can't explain to anybody without them making a disgusted face."}
{"text":"Kindness: An Artistic Undertaking\n\nIt of his debut album, World, You Need A Change of Mind, under the moniker Kindness.\n\nIn the video for \"Gee Up,\" the first single off of World, Bainbridge sits on the set for the production of the video. Assistants make awkward sexual advances. A francophone Exec rants. Bainbridge himself even steps out of from behind his artistic fa\u00e7ade, holding up the record and announcing its release date. In doing so, he acknowledges the murky line between art and consumerism.\n\nBut that's not the strangest moment of the movie. As two men talk on the set, one states, \"I kind of like it. Lo-fi with hi-fi values.\" \"Would've been better two years ago though, wouldn't it have?\" the other responds.\n\nThis is notable because Kindness' music doesn't relate to a specific genre or sound\u2013-lo-fi or hi-fi-\u2013nor does it harken to any one time period. For an album that lasts only forty minutes, World, You Need A Change of Mind covers a lot of ground. There's the funky disco of \"Doigsong,\" akin to Toro y Moi. There's a cover of the Replacements (\"Swinging Party\") and the EastEnders theme, \"Anyone Can Fall in Love.\"\n\nDespite such concrete references, as a whole, World, You Need A Change of Mind works incredibly well as a singular piece of music. The album floats by like a hazy Spring day lost somewhere between coffee and joints. Bainbridge effortlessly transcends genres and eras with a wide range of sounds and ideas from the ironically gentle thwomp of the bass on \"House\" to the catchy female hook of \"That's Alright.\"\n\nIt can be frustrating when artists such as Brainbridge and Kindness lack an easily identified style or objective. Like a rock climbing wall devoid of any holds or a roadmap with no roads, a direction may be unclear. Sometimes though, it's better to step back and admire the piece as a whole, such as with World, You Need A Change of Mind, an album so lush and beautiful, yet so short, that it takes you on a ride and delivers you exactly where you want to be, whether you know it or not"}

This 2012 dark ambient release from British duo, who have been experimenting since 1981, drones and mutters and almost feels magickal in intent. Nurse With Wound, Altar of Flies, Coil, SPK. Most unsettling. They had synthesizers, and other things; a magician never reveals his secrets, huh? Sometimes it's melodic (chords recur throughout), sometimes it drones, sometimes it's a barely-there foreboding. At one point near the middle (the title movement, in fact) there's a period of rhythmic Swans clanking and death-growling.

{"text":"Eugene McGuinness 'The Invitation to the Voyage' (Domino)\n\nEugene McGuinnes returns with his second album, 'The Invitation to the Voyage', a collection of swaggering, vaguely unsettling glam-pop songs.\n\nAlbum opener 'Harlequinade' is the perfect example of that; McGuinness croons over the hook-heavy synth and strings, talking menacingly about MDMA, Zippo lighters and 'going for the jugular'. We also get our first look at McGuinness' lyrical prowess; \"It's a hoedown, a showdown, a shindig and a knees-up, too.\"\n\nWhen you look at who produced the album, it's easy to see why 'The Invitation' carries its crooning rockabilly disco sound; Clive Langer has worked with icons such as Elvis Costello and Morrissey, and Dan Carey helped electronic stars M.I.A. and Hot Chip along their way. So McGuinness' brand of vaudevillian electro swing comes as no surprise.\n\nAs Plan B did with his 'London Soul', McGuinness is taking UK pop music in a new direction. His voice holds a familiar Alex Turner arrogance, and it floats over thumping synth and occasionally grungy guitar. There aren't a lot of people making this kind of music, and that's a great sign for McGuinness. However it does seem as though it's too dark for the mainstream, and too rich and verbose to ever be really 'cool'.\n\nOn 'Videogame', McGuinness slows everything down, and rather than picturing the image of his slick, pool-hall villain, he channels a much more welcome Jesus and Mary Chain-esque sound. If The Horrors had written the soundtrack to Juno, it would have sounded like this.\n\n\"I wanted to do a record that just reflected positivity, that feeling of coming out of a difficult period and looking forwardm,\" he says. McGuinness has certainly done this, and there is a tangible sense of rebirth, but it does become a little laboured at times. Musically, the album is generally engaging, and it's all very lush, but at times (such as on 'Lion') you get the image of middle aged men in waistcoats playing 'really funky' music to a similarly aged parochial audience.\n\n'The Invitation to the Voyage' is a nifty collection of hyperbolic swing, but only two or three of the tracks really stand out. For the most part, it all seems half finished, so the sinister tone it craves is too round edged, and it could be razor sharp. Oh, except for 'Japanese Cars', that's great and ready for airplay and stadiums alike."}

The only variation of his vocals that I didn't enjoy was his falsetto ('Happy in Love') when I thought for a moment I was listening to a whiny Chris Martin. It's also nice that his voice is never overpowered by background music.\n\nHis vocals would be nothing without the emotional and melodic lyrics, which are pleasant to actually listen to, or just to catch the occasional word of.\n\nFavorite song: The opening 'Oh No!,' a slow, winding and warm song featuring laid back guitar and drums. Enough to make you immediately stop wondering about the band's name\u2026"}

Most dramatic are the Thurlow's voices, which are airy, in an almost religious manner, which effectively juxtapose their harsh guitars. They achieve the aural feeling of a subdued School of Seven bells.\n\nOn the eve of their release, and while preparing for their biggest headline show to date at Scala, we managed to catch up with Collette for a Londonist Q&A.\n\nWhat do 2:54 sound like in a sentence? Dark, menacing, feminine.\n\nWhy did you want to start making music together? We've played music together since our teens, it naturally evolved into 2:54.\n\nWho are your influences music and non-music? Doolin Point in Co. Clare, Ireland where our album cover was shot, a place we spent our childhood summers. Also, soundtrack music, Angelo Badalamenti, Trevor Jones.\n\nHow exciting is to be releasing your debut album? Incredibly! We're very excited for it to be out in the world.\n\nHow was it written and recorded? Hannah and I completed all the songs at home, when we finish a demo at home, they're finished. We then took the songs to be recorded at Monow Valley in Wales with Rob Ellis, which was a great experience.\n\nWhat area of London are you based and how has that area influenced 2:54's music? Hackney, for nigh on 11 years, it's a great place to live but it hasn't influenced the music I'm afraid.\n\nWhat's your favorite London venue and why? Scala, it's a wonderful, warm sounding room with a great stage. We're really excited to be playing our own show there in June.\n\nWhat's the London gig circuit like for bands starting out and is it good to grow in and gain exposure? We've only played a handful of shows in London, but I think all gigging is beneficial in the development of a band, no matter where you are in the country or the size of a venue.\n\nWhere would 2:54 like to play if you could play anywhere in London? I wouldn't mind checking out the reverb in Battersea Power station.\n\nWhat's your favorite\u2026 \u2026London monument? Anything in Trafalgar square because it still feels like a movie when I go there. \u2026tube line and why? Central, hands down the quickest. \u2026place to hang out? Soho, it still has a glamour to it, for me. \u2026Area for food? All over, that's the beauty of London.\n\nYou've constantly been receiving critical and blog attention. Has this created any pressure for you, if so how have you dealt with it? We just concentrate on making the songs and developing the live show, learning how to tour, those things.\n\nWhat's been 2:54's career highlight so far? Everything, being able to play music everyday with the four of us, with Alex and Joel our amazing rhythm section, is a dream come true.\n\nWhat are your future plans? The release of our album, our Scala show in June, America and festivals."}

The three have known each other for years\u2014Stewart and Dillon are cousins, and Shell has been their friend since their teens.\n\nThe group came together after playing in different bands to experiment with their own unique sound, and a trifecta of artistic views sparked the development most recently heard on their third album, \"beehives.\"\n\nStewart chatted with The Chronicle about the struggle of writing lyrics, creative processes, friendship and the importance of\ninstrumental differences.\n\nThe Chronicle: What bands inspire your music, and were you able to learn from their dynamics to work better together?\n\nScot Stewart: All three of us have pretty similar tastes in music. We really like Radiohead, but I feel like everyone in the world does. And then I really like The Beatles. I wouldn't say we sound anything like either one of them, but they're both such diverse bands. You take a lot of things out of listening to either one of those bands because every record from [them] is different.\n\nYou say these groups inspire you to play music, but you come up with an entirely different sound. How do you think\nthat happens?\n\nWe all have our [inspirations] that come from somewhere, but we never wanted to be a super pop-rock band or anything like that, playing something [that] would [belong] on a pop radio station. I feel like the sound of our music comes more from our personalities than our musical influences. We're all kind of weird people, I guess. Maybe that comes across in the\nmusic somehow.\n\nYour sound is a combination of folk and country, and it has a fun, cartoonish quality. What was it like creating such a unique representation of\nyour work?\n\nThis new record, \"beehives,\" is way different than our last two. It's a very different sounding thing, at least to us. We want it to sound basically like a documentation of our live show.\n\nRegardless of what happens live, let's just make a cool sounding record. We just had a different mindset about it this time.\n\nWhat are you trying to convey when you write lyrics?\n\nIf you end up writing a whole page full of stuff when you only have four lines for a song, it's kind of picking and choosing. Sometimes the music is first, and I'll end up placing vocals in there, and other times I'll have an idea for a melody or something I want to say, and I form the music around it. It's a pretty\nrandom process.\n\nDo you think you've perfected your sound and are able to say things on this album that you weren't able to say on\nthe others?\n\nI wouldn't say we have ever perfected anything. I feel like we're always striving to be better. That was one of the main things we went at going for this [album]. We really wanted to challenge ourselves. I think that's part of the reason this one is a lot different from the last two. The goal from the start was we all wanted to try something different on our individual instruments that we've never done before. At first, when these songs were written, we couldn't even play them. We had ideas we wanted to happen, but we were all pushing ourselves in a way that we had never done before to create something that sounds even crazier. Everything's a lot faster and upbeat. Everyone has different ideas. No three people are going to create the same music.\n\nFor more information, go to InFlewAnts.com.

{"text":"Review : ROGUE WAVE - Descended Like Vultures\n\nThe temptation is to start name-dropping. We could start talking about how Zach Rogue's vocals split the difference between Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff Mangum and the Shins' James Mercer, how the guitars twinkle and spark like Radiohead's glory days, how Rogue's tunes have the plasticine sheen of Death Cab for Cutie and the same weepy sincerity, and how naming your band after your last name is kinda lame.

Most of my all-time favorite albums have a sense of grief hidden between tracks; not emo and all its (mostly) petty theatrics, but the John Lennon\/Plastic Ono Band sense of grief.

{"text":"2012: the year of the supposed apocalypse. News media and pop culture thrived on an \"end of days\" mentality, and it was all given weight by things like the election, the environmental catastrophes, the ignored inequalities, and the Tupac hologram. The end did, indeed, seem near. In this dramatic atmosphere, a lot of great music was released, but none felt more relevant than Grimes' Visions. Visions is a confluence of culture, technology, music, and personal experience, together forming something that feels, like very few other recent cultural artifacts, truly futuristic.\n\nI first heard Grimes when I downloaded a mixtape from the always great blog Disco Na\u00efvet\u00e9 in fall 2011. On the tape was the soon-to-be-viral hit \"Oblivion,\" which I listened to obsessively. The album really became meaningful for me when I finally looked up the lyrics to \"Oblivion,\" and realized it wasn't just a great pop song, but a testament of sadness and struggle, and a battle cry against the parts of us that get in the way of our success and happiness. The album, for all its catchy hooks and beats, has a sense of ghostly loneliness, and on \"Oblivion,\" Grimes explains how even her success can be alienating (\"when you're running by yourself, it's hard to find someone to hold your hand\"). But, as she puts it, \"I will wait forever,\" a statement I find empowering rather than defeating. She's not about to give up. Maybe the world isn't ending.\n\nBut why did Grimes' music and persona enrapture critics, electronic music fans, and teen bloggers alike? Maybe because it felt \"new\" in a way that has been noticeably lacking in recent years, and that part of that newness came through in the way it acknowledged that the social Internet is here to stay, and it is profoundly changing the way we live. This technology is transforming how art is created and consumed, the way human interaction occurs, and our perception of ourselves as a species.\n\nThe generation with no name yet \u2014 the kids who populate Tumblr and TinyChat who will succeed the much-discussed (and derided) \"millenials\" \u2014 have found their icon. The songs off Visions, which Grimes herself has described as \"post-Internet,\" sound like how we connect and experience the world online. There's a webby, networked aura to the echoing, trippy beats and layered vocals. The songs can feel both overwhelming and sparse, human and inhuman, easily distractible and addictive. Her lyrics hint at a future where everything is seemingly up for grabs, with culture opening up in a way it never has before. Previously rigid categories of gender, sexuality, subculture, and cultural history are all accessible simultaneously, allowing for a playground of self-representation in which anyone with Internet access can participate. This is what meme culture is building up to, and this is why so many young people identify so strongly with Grimes. Her music and aesthetic doesn't feel like a static masterpiece, but something any creatively inclined person could emulate, tweak, and expand on \u2014 a Meme Generator for art.\n\nGrimes' popularity can serve as a window to a subculture, in the same way that Nirvana was an indirect path to riot grrrl bands for a generation of '90s kids. She can lead young people to the the world of subversive Net artists like Ryder Ripps, gender binary-dismantling rappers like Mykki Blanco, or less accessible female electronic artists like Laurel Halo. The Internet-based music and art that Grimes' rise to fame gives points to is full of people who have rarely had the privilege of the spotlight and who fully deserve to be discovered by a wider audience.\n\nGrimes is important to me because she provides an alternative narrative for what the future holds and a constantly evolving relationship between humans, technology, and art that would scare Bill O'Reilly shitless. She makes me believe that apocalypse or not, there are still amazing possibilities for art in this absurd and endlessly complex world of ours, and thanks to the Internet, we may all create it together.\n\nSophie Weiner is a 22-year-old Brooklyn resident who spends way too much time thinking about culture and the Internet. She has written for Flavorwire and MTV and is in a performance art group\/Lynchian pop band called Silent Drape Runners Grimes sounds like someone who grew up listening to her mom's Cocteau Twins ( CD's\n2) Meaningless lyrics are \"new\" now they way they were \"new\" when REM came out with Swan Swan Hummingbird. They were \"new\" 1916 when the Dada movement started. They were \"new\" the first time a kid who didnt know the words to a song tried to sing along. Not that new.\n3) anything that \"would scare Bill O'Reilly shitless\" gets bonus points for effort\n4) Grimes doesnt come off as all that pretentious. The article does a bit though.\n\nAhhh\u2026.this article was cute.I remember when I was 22 how earnestly intellectual I got about music as well. Except I wrote about it in my journal instead of posting it online - largely because the internet didn't really exist then (I was a teen in the 80s to give some perspective).I do agree that Grimes Visions (along with Crystal Castles III; Light Asylum Light Asylum; Jon Convex Idoru; and LA Vampires collbaborations with Octo Octa and Maria Minvera) is one of the best electronic albums of 2012.The article is a bit much, but the music itself is pretty awesome. Then again, I've always had weird taste in music.\n\nI find it quite amusing listening to how people (inadvertently?) brand, then bind, themselves. I prefer viewing a much wider horizon over experiencing life wearing blinders so constricting that the ever-shrinking vista eventually turns so far inward that all I see is myself.\n\nWas this article meant to be ironic? I thought the music sucked but whatever, to each his own. However, I really don't think it warranted the hyperbolic tone this article took on. I mean, did her music really give you hope that the world wasn't ending? Ugh\u2026I must be getting old\n\nI'd say you're grafting too much social import onto Grimes's music and aesthetic than it warrants. Ultimately I think she's gaining popularity 1) because she has a beautiful voice, the type that very rarely stays out of the mainstream bubblegum pop arena for long, 2) she's latched onto this sort of quirky art school dropout naivety that still feels very genuine and 3) with the latest record she's balanced on this uncorrupted razors edge between avante garde electronica and pop that I think people find novel. The suggestion that her lyrics are some sort of generational calling card I find bizarre, considering that her lyrics are such simple \"baby baby\" lines and so deeply swamped in reverb and delay that they're a practically indiscernible as sonic texture gibberish. If there's some sort of message in there no one's going to understand it. I've listened to \"Visions\" probably 30 times now and I have no idea WTF she's singingIf her art is supposed to have some sort of impact I don't see it either - while the Oblivion video was really beautiful visually it didn't hit on anything particularly new as a theme and her other work just seems like an art school graduation portfolio. There was some sort of commentary in the Genesis video that hints a reaction to lady gaga's pop masquerading as avante garde but I would say its nearly as shallow (and certainly more boring) than the Die Antwoord take on the subject. In reality think the most groundbreaking part of Grime's success today is just the fact that she's a female solo electronic act that's making a real mark - there's actually been a bit of a glass ceiling there that I don't think most folks are totally aware of. If you look at other popular female-fronted electronic acts, all have a man in the background on stage pushing the buttons, but Grimes seems generally in 100% control of her production and performance which is a pretty big deal. She makes pretty music and broke some feminist boundaries, but the voice of a new generation? I doubt it"}

{"text":"If there was ever a reason to start up a musical side project, pioneering a far-out sub-genre like \"doom-wop\" would be it.\n\n\"I guess I coined the term sort of facetiously. I'm not sure how much doom metal will actually shine through,\" Islands frontman Nick Thorburn tells Spinner of his new outfit, which falls sonically somewhere between low-frequency drone and classic doo-wop.\n\nStill in its early stages, the currently-untitled project is a collaboration between Thorburn and Ryan Kattner -- otherwise known as Honus Honus, frontman for Philadelphia's Man Man. The new partnership isn't intended to eclipse the pair's respective day jobs. \"We're just trying to make each other laugh and enjoy each other's company creatively,\" Thorburn explains.\n\nThe group's repertoire may still be limited -- two or three songs in Thorburn's estimation -- but it's quite an achievement when you consider the cross-state commute Kattner has to make every time the duo feels like working on what the the New York-based Thorburn calls their \"old-timey beats.\"\n\nWith news of doom-wop's debut sparking interest throughout the blogosphere, you'd assume that Thorburn and Kattner would do their best to capitalize on the hype with a quick bout of releases. According to the ex-Montrealer though, that's not how they're going to play it. \"We won't release a proper record necessarily,\" Thorburn says. \"We're probably going to release all the tracks on the Internet at the same time, do something forward-thinking.\"\n\nThat's frustrating news for those dying to get a sense of what doom-wop is all about, but by the time we actually get the chance to hear the duo's tracks firsthand, they might be dealing with an entirely different genre, if Thorburn's free-flowing attitude is any indication. \"One of the completed songs has more of a 'doom-reggae' feel than doom-wop,\" he says, \"but we'll see.\""}

The album is an elegy to a life lived for the benefit of humans and raises complex questions about our relationship to these often-maligned and misunderstood creatures.\n\nThe album is made entirely out of sounds from the pig and its surroundings - the first squeals, the sound of it being alone for the first time, and the dripping of its blood after being butchered. The result is a delicate, beautiful, and occasional terrifying musical composition with a profundity rarely heard in electronic music.\n\nThe live show is a performance of the album with a five piece band, using keyboards, samplers, drum machines, and a brand new custom instrument - the \"Sty Harp\", built and performed by Edinburgh-based artist Yann Seznec.\n\nAfter touring around the world from London to Berlin to Tokyo, One Pig now comes to Scotland for seven shows.

{"text":"For folky songwriter Jack Milas and electro-pop producer Oli Chang, what began as \"mucking around\" in a recording studio in Sydney, Australia, has blossomed into a serious project, High Highs. Now based in Brooklyn, the duo makes ruminative, dreamlike pop, rich with falsetto harmonies and nuanced electronic glaze. High Highs built significant buzz last fall around their debut single, 'Open Season,' and are now working on a full-length. Spinner talked with Milas about moving halfway across the world, the luck of having his bandmate follow and why someday, the band's sound might be described as \"church wave.\"\n\nOli and I met in Sydney, working at the same recording studio, and we started mucking around. I was bringing songs. He was making this dance music but pushing himself in a new direction. We only did two gigs in Sydney. It wasn't that serious. It slowly grew a bit serious. I suppose that's how all bands start, really.\n\nHow did you end up in New York?\n\nIt's a boring story. We were here working. It was lucky we both came over here so we could pick the project back up. We both work for the same company. First I had an offer to come and then Oli did, too. I was doing my own thing, enjoying the city, writing as well, then when Oli came over, we thought, \"This is an incredible opportunity to keep working on High Highs.\" We were lucky to find a drummer, Zach [Lipkins]. It's definitely gotten more serious since we've been here.\n\nWas there a culture shock, coming from Australia to New York?\n\nI was just in Sydney, and coming back here, for one, it's absolutely freezing. New York is a special place to be, but also an intense place to be. You have to fight for rehearsal space. It's very crowded. [Oli and I] both live in Brooklyn and are surrounded by so many musicians everywhere. It's really motivating.\n\nCan you compare Sydney's music scene to New York's?\n\nSydney has a lot of amazing stuff going on, but it's true that it's a long way away from everywhere. That sense of being far away from where the majority of exciting stuff is happening in the world, that can be daunting. There's a lot of really great music in Sydney, but it's hard to break out sometimes. It's tricky.\n\nHow did you make that transition to a serious band?\n\nWe both realized there was almost an album written in Sydney. Then when Oli came over to New York, we figured it was too lucky to not take action. We both moved halfway around the world -- we had to give it a bit of a stab. I kept writing songs, and you sort of have to do something with them. Otherwise, why write songs? We had to keep going with them. We've only put out two songs, and that's the story of it so far.\n\nYou've received quite a bit of attention for those songs. Does it feel overwhelming at times?\n\nIt's pretty weird, for sure. It's that old thing where we're so close to the music that it's hard to know what people are going to think. You put it out and remember why you started doing it in the first place, and it's so amazing to us to see that people like it. People so far away from my home, people in New York, they like High Highs.\n\nSo far, you guys are unsigned. Is the DIY approach intentional, or are you waiting for the right opportunity?\n\nWhen you start a band, you learn how important it is to assemble a team around your band. Every step is so crucial that we don't see a reason to rush. You really have got to be sure. We are talking to labels, but it's too early to commit to anything there, and too early for them as well. We're going to put out an EP, and we'll do that mostly ourselves. We're holding off because we're handling it fine at the moment. It's mainly because we're trying to be really careful to surround ourselves with people we really like.\n\nHow do two guys who come from very different musical backgrounds write together?\n\nI write a song and bring it to him. Oli has an amazing ear. He knows how to write dance music, but he's also a great producer, great at producing beautiful, warm sounds. Often I'll just bring something in, and we'll record electric or acoustic guitar and sing on it, and he'll work on it for a day, and I'll listen to it and think, \"Wow.\"\n\nAs a songwriter, what are your influences?\n\nI love Neil Young. We both love Boards of Canada. Oli is particularly influenced by their sounds. He has a laptop setup with these really textured sounds he's been working on for ages.\n\nHow long have you been writing music?\n\nI'm only 22. I haven't been writing a long time. I certainly haven't been writing anything good for many years. High Highs is the first thing I've ever done that isn't terribly, shockingly bad, or the first thing that wasn't played for my mother when I was living at home.\n\nDid you always plan on becoming a musician?\n\nI thought I always wanted to be involved in music somehow, but I never thought I would be a singer of a band. I remember joking with my mother about if I were singing in a band and how ridiculous that would be -- and I'm actually doing it now. I was the worst singer in my group of friends at school. I always thought I had a pretty terrible, or limited, voice. I didn't know I would be a singer of a band. It's still weird.\n\nWhere did the band name come from?\n\nHigh Highs is the name of song by a band called Viva Voce, who are great. But actually, I didn't know them when I heard the name. My dad -- I consider him to be a cool dad -- listens to the radio in Sydney and recommended the song. The song was great, but I was struck by using the name for a band. I said it to Oli one day, and he said, \"Yeah, cool,\" and it stuck. It's also a bit literal for our style. It sort of describes us. It works well.\n\nHow does it describe you?\n\nI sing high. I sing in falsetto some of the time. Even when I don't, I still probably sound like I'm singing pretty high. I find it easy to write songs in that register, easy to hear melodies. It's a literal name, as well, for our style of music.\n\nOur PR agent, she wanted to insist that our genre of music is \"church wave.\" I find the whole \"wave\" thing really funny, in a good way. It works. It's not music that's religious in any way. It would just sound good in a church. Maybe we're on to something.\n\nCatch High Highs' SXSW Set on Saturday, March 19 at The Velveeta Room (521 E 6th St.) 12AM."}
{"text":"Friday, November 27, 2009\n\nThis week, I'm highlighting an album instead of just a song... because I can.\n\n\"This is Not a False Alarm Anymore\" is the debut album from Toronto's moody electronic guy, v01d. The maturity and contemplative nature of the songs (not to be mistaken for \"boring\") is a testament to the years v01d's Joseph Byer has spent working with music, and forming his sound. Anyone that heard earlier v01d will hear the difference right away. These songs are not meant for a dancefloor... but are building, growing, evolving experiences.\n\nHighlights of the album include the sort-of-title-track \"Feel Me Fade\", electro waltz \"Resurrected Upon Landing\", the MC 900 ft Jesusesque \"Gods Look Down\", and sexy-but-depressing \"This Moment is Over\".\n\nThis album also has a companion album, \"Burnt Upon Re-Entry\", available digitally or as a part of a limited 2-CD set. It offers up some new tracks (including the seemingly out of character rap track \"End of Life\"), some remixes and alternate versions of album tracks.\n\nTo end off this post, we have the video trailer for the album... BUY IT NOW!\n\nFriday, November 13, 2009\n\nI can't quite reconcile the sound that comes out of this tiny girl's mouth with her appearance. Doesn't quite mesh, does it? Yet she somehow manages to go from a growly cookie-monster voice to a fun girlie metal voice. I think that's a thing that's baffled Kittie fans since they first appeared many years ago. Hard to believe, considering how young they *still* are.\n\nFor years, I have had Brackish in my playlists, and now I've got some new songs to add. The new single, Cut Throat, is pretty wicked. They are a great band, who just happen to be made up entirely of girls. Pretty sweet. Plus, Canadian.\n\nCheck out their new album, \"In the Black\". Highlights include Cut Throat, Die My Darling, and Now or Never.\n\nSaturday, October 10, 2009\n\nThis video is pretty cute. Alice in Videoland is an electro-punk-pop band from Sweden, on Artoffact Records (for North America). Their songs are usually pretty short, extremely fun and pretty much insane.\n\nThis song is from their third album, of the same name, \"She's a Machine\", which also features a duet with Maja from the Sounds (\"We Are Rebels\") and a cover of Guano Apes (\"Open Your Eyes\"). Pretty wicked.\n\nBlerg! Why is my newest favourite metal band a cartoon!?? Yeah, it's one of those weird things where I'm not really into the genre so much anymore, but I still like the stuff I liked before and also plus I watch cartoons. In walks Dethklok (from the show Metalocalypse) with their weirdo bad accents, insanely unlucky fans and incredibly armed goons. Yeah, and also some apocalyptic prophecy involving the band."}

{"text":"Front Page Reviews & AIR\n\nMumford and Sons - Babel\n\nBabel is a perfect album. If taken on Mumford and Sons' own terms, the album has no flaws to consider; the band achieved everything they wanted to on Babel. The only thing left to discuss is one's individual reaction to it.\n\nThis is a different kind of perfection than the type that earns perfect tens from critics (see Kanye West's artistically-minded My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which earned max numbers from critics who also acknowledged the album's flaws). But on Babel, the exact same elements that will be beloved by one camp will be excoriated by another, and none of that rhetoric will have anything to do with how well or poorly the members of the band achieved their own songwriting and performance goals.\n\n***\n\nSome goals of Mumford and Sons on Babel:\n\nCreate an album that does not upset previous fans of the band.\n\nMove the lyrical conversation from questions of grace to answers about grace.\n\nCraft at least one melody per song that can be sung along to.\n\nWrite in as many moments of screaming catharsis as possible.\n\nWrite another ubiquitous hit (or several).\n\nHave as much fun as possible while playing songs.\n\nSome goals that Mumford and Sons do not have on Babel:\n\nCreate \"artsy folk,\" as determined by the examples of Fleet Foxes, Grizzly Bear and The Decemberists.\n\nWrite cryptic, Dylan-esque poetry for lyrics.\n\nWrite dark, depressing tunes a la everyone else.\n\nObserve nuance.\n\nExperiment with song structures and instrumentation.\n\nCourt critical approval.\n\nIn short, Mumford and Sons made the most obvious record they could. It is good-hearted, easily digestible, fun to sing along with, and completely devoid of sinister ambitions. Nothing is hard to understand whatsoever. As NPR's Ann Powers so neatly noted, this drives elitists nuts. On the other hand, consumers love that stuff. Let the rhetoric ensue.\n\n***\n\nAs far as I've read, the reviews of Babel that go beyond a simple song-by-song analysis have focused on two main themes: the lyrical emphasis on religion and the lack of musical progression from Sigh No More. I have sought the opinions of critics and friends, and the thoughts of players from both categories form a sort of Punnett square:\n\nIn other words, Babel is an aesthetic Rorschach test on two fronts: How do you feel about people singing through religious themes in a secular pop music environment? How do you feel about bands that don't even try to change from album to album?\n\nAgain, it takes a fully-realized album to crystallize an argument this concrete. If Babel failed at one of its own goals, it could be easily demoted from thinkpiece creation as a \"sophomore slump.\" But because it succeeds at all of its goals, there is no shortcoming in execution to hammer. The goals themselves are the divisive elements; therefore, what some will adore, others will hate. Liking Babel forces you to explain to yourself and others why you like it; hating Babel does the same. You can't just say, \"Oh, you know, the thing everyone hates about it,\" and leave it at that.\n\nTo wit: the band features four-part harmonies on almost every song; fans say it's leaning on their skills, critics that it's fear of stepping outside them. All the songs but one draw their power from a quiet\/loud tension; either it's mature craft or lazy repetition. Love it or hate it: the songs all operate at the same level. Gripe or grin: Mumford delivers his earnest lyrics vigorously.\n\nThe only truly objective thing that can be said about Babel is that it is a collection of songs composed mostly for vocals, guitar, banjo, bass, kick drum and piano that all sound very similar. Any judgment placed on that frame needs to be explained in full, because you can't say that Mumford and Sons don't sing well. You have to explain why you don't like how they sing well. You can't say that Mumford and Sons are ambitious in their songwriting structures; you can only explain why you think it's a good thing that they are not.\n\n***\n\nSince I just explained away the section where I talk about how I feel about the album, I'll make my two cents quick: I love the album, because, according to the aforementioned Punnett square, I'm both pro-lyrical themes and pro-lack of progression.\n\nA. I'm a Christian, so I enjoy hearing some Christian theology in popular music. I'm under no pretensions that this album is high exegesis, nor am I expecting any second Jesus Movement. I just like hearing about Jesus on the radio. If nothing else, it's a nice change of pace. How Babel relates to the sociological phenomenon of Christian music is another article entirely; let's just say that Christian music suffers from a lack of artful lyrical expression. And though Babel does not display masterful prose on par with John Darnielle (The Mountain Goats), it's an upgrade compared to most music about Jesus in this respect.\n\nB. Why did Mumford and Sons need to progress? They play folk songs, which to me means \"can and should be played by anyone.\" And by that measure, the fact that I can learn \"I Will Wait\" quite easily makes it a great folk song. What's so wrong with a bunch of simple, boisterous, bellow-them-around-a-campfire folk songs? If in 100 years no one remembers the author of \"Lover of the Light\" but people still play it all the time, that would be a perfectly fitting fate for the tune. In fact, someone else could pour time into an arrangement of \"Whispers in the Dark\" and end up with the definitive version of the tune, because there's really not that much of an arrangement around Babel's version of that or any other song (with the exception of the excellent \"Below My Feet\" and \"Broken Crown\"). Making sophisticated art is just not the point of this album.\n\n***\n\nThis sort of obvious, earnest, no-background-needed album resists traditional rock criticism, and (of course) Marcus Mumford knows it: He bellows, \"I leave no time for a cynic's mind\" in closer \"Not With Haste,\" which functions both as a great thesis statement for this album and one of the most admirable sidesteps ever. \"You don't like it, eh? Well, it's not for you, critic! Begone!\" It's a perfect line for a perfect album. They know they've got what they've got, and if you don't like it, the burden of explanation is on you. What do you want to believe about Mumford and Sons? You can support that opinion with Babel. You won't be wrong."}
{"text":"After the forest had stopped burning, Babel decided to walk back to where the monastery had stood to take inventory, with only the glockenspiel that he had saved from the flames as supplies. All the trees and any hunter's huts had been reduced to low laying burnt stuff, so he could see the blackened, but still standing ruins in the distance. It had been a frantic flight from the fire, but now, with everything gone, and all quiet descended, time took its time to get him there. Then the bellbirds began to return. Slowly at first, but as the rising sun caught the metal bars of the glockenspiel, more and more began to circle. Babel fond that if he held his metallophone to his ear he could understand their gongy tones, and that if held it sideways to his mouth, not only did it turn his frown into a tin-man's maniacal grin, but he could control the bellbirds movements. Not that he asked them to move that much, but sometimes he did, and if there had been anyone around to hear it, they might have thought a traveling symphony, or the annual Philip Glass Percussive Parade had been passing though.\n\nTranslation and Epilogue:\n\nBabel is the modern-classical outlet of Jakob Rehlinger, who can also be heard as the lonely guitar (that sounds like a peyote trip in the desert) called Moonwood, and also the owner of the great, Etobicoke based, experimental\/freak-folk label Arachnidisks Recordings. One of the most prolific musicians in town, this is his third release this year on his own label, and his second as Babel. Glockengeister finds him in a quiet, minimal mood, experimenting with a recently acquisitioned glockenspiel that acts as a centerpiece for the album. Joined only occasionally by sparse percussion, that is similar to the backing bells of his Moonwood work, these pieces take all the time they need to mature, lasting anywhere from one and a half to thirteen minutes. There's a real feeling of exploration on this disk, as if his new fond instrument were a huge cathedral he had just inherited, and he was wandering threw all the rooms, discovering their particular personalities. Some require more attention than others. Some are busy with bells. Some are barely there. Overall, it's a very soft, spiritual atmosphere that should be your next soundtrack for falling asleep into lucid dreaming."}
{"text":"Mugison: Little Trip\nIn the wake of Bjork, Goldfrapp, Sigur Ros and other Icelandic electronica acts, the record biz is dusting off some of the second tier of recent electronica albums from the volcanic island nation of 280,000. Given that the entire population of the country is only two thirds that of Fresno, California, one has to start wondering just how deep the trough can run. Mugison, a former sailor from the northwestern corner of the island, almost a stone's throw from the north pole, has released three albums over the last few years, and appeared at Scotland's Triptych festival in 2004, which gained him international interest. He tours with all of his equipment in a single suitcase; he and his family hand-stitched the elaborate packaging for 10,000 copies of his 2003 debut, Lonely Mountain.\n\nLittle Trip, the soundtrack to Baltasar Kormakur's 2005 of the same name, has been given a new push in 2006 by Ipecac, and offers a handy jumping-in point. So, is this another boldly innovative Icelander who will teach the continentals a thing or two about the possibilities in music? Well not really, but he keeps some conventions in circulation, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Half of this album is ambient balladry, featuring romantic vocals (sung in English most of the time) like on the fairly irrestistable \"Little Trip to Heaven,\" which boasts a tranquil, almost Pacific Island-affected slide guitar, and gentle brushes on the drums. Elsewhere, like on \"Alone In The Office,\" we get a somnambular chillout groove with muted horns that sounds a lot more like conventional British electronica. On still other pieces, mostly on fragments under two minutes, we have abrasive white-noise constructs as on \"Mugicone, Part 2\", where the disc really does sound like movie music. Those expecting something to grab them by the lapels will greet this with a big yawn. However, it's certainly inoffensive, and if nothing here is really new, it reshuffles them into a likeable sleepy-time collage.\n\nMemphis Slim: I Am The Blues\nMemphis Slim (born John \"Peter\" Chatman, 1915-1988) was a piano player extraordinaire on the Memphis circuit following World War II, where he largely inherited the crown of Big Bill Broonzy as Memphis' most respected ivory tinkler. His rich, earthy, always in-control voice was commanding, and he was a gifted songwriter as well, penning classics that were covered by Lowell Fulson, Joe Williams, and B.B. King among others.\n\nArticle comments\n\nOne of the best concerts I have every gone to was Rita Lee's first concert in Brasilia after being censored\/banned by the government. That was 1983. There was a cyclone fence between the crowd and that stage was pushed down pretty fast. When the police started hitting people who were trying to get close to the stage Rita stopped singing and lambasted the police. They backed off."}
{"text":"Dusted Reviews\n\nThe nine songs that comprise Parisian quartet Cyann & Ben's Spring, if translated into visual form, would probably look something like the swarm of insects on the album's cover: although they ultimately work together to create a unified mass, they seem to be swirling in all directions at once, never quite settling down into a comfortably identifiable form. Despite the fact that most tracks employ guitar, analog synth, and vocals, Cyann & Ben certainly aren't a \"rock\" band, nor are they comparable to other lo-fi synth-driven ensembles. If anything, they recall the slow-building post-rock of Mogwai and Godspeed! You Black Emperor, but in a more rustic and psychedelic form. Like many of their songs, they seem to be many things at once, but ultimately transcend any recognizable influences to create a sound that is genuinely novel and intriguing, and very hard to pin down at times.\n\nSpring's disorienting quality can probably be attributed to the fact that while most of the tracks suggest a traditional song structure (vocal melody line, a discernable pattern of repeated sections), they don't end up fulfilling it: instead of going from point A to B to Z, as we might expect, the music seems to spread out like a pool of oil on the ground. \"I Can't Pretend Anymore,\" despite commencing with a simple synth arpeggio and melody line, eventually melts into seemingly random bits of ambient sound, which in turn segue into the following track, \"Siren Song.\" Probably the most effective piece on the album, \"Siren Song\" combines an arpeggiated electric guitar figure that recalls The Bends-era Radiohead with synth bass and jazz-inflected drumming, and climaxes with a doubled guitar and synth melody that could have been lifted from a Morricone score. On the whole, however, particular song structures are less important to the album's success than a sustained mood or atmosphere. Spring is invariably downtempo, creating a sense of melancholy and meditation that finds a comfortable counterpart in the almost exclusively minor-key melodies.\n\nDespite their prominence, the vocals add little to the overall effect, given that they're rarely intelligible (due to strong French accents). When the words can be made out, they tend to seem incongruously unrestrained and fanciful in contrast to the music (\"the wind unicorn is waiting for you in the light of the moon!\"). This however, matters little, as the vocals serve more as instruments than as a means for verbal communication.\n\nSpring can be a frustrating listen. Its sprawling, structurally-convoluted songs can seem a bit arbitrary at first, and often times sound as though they could be pared down to a more conventional form. Repeated listens, however, reveal an underlying flow that has little regard for immediate accessibility and gratification. Prostrate headphone listening may be the best way to take in Cyann & Ben; Spring will ultimately reward those who can assume the same reflective and attentive mindset with which it was made."}
{"text":"Animal Collective - Water Curses EP (Domino)\n\nUK release date: 5 May 2008\n\nLast year's Strawberry Jam saw Animal Collective's atonal, droney folk sound mellowing into something smoother. The title track from the Water Curses EP initially picks up where this left off, with the familiar swirling electronics and giddy hurdy-gurdy organ, buoyed up by Avey Tare's helium-voiced whimsy.\n\nThis doesn't mean it's easy listening, just that it's listenable. Not a word is distinguishable, and within two minutes we have a cacophony of synthesised violins and flutes, tinkling noises, and what sounds like a Soviet military march played backwards. Though it trips along with no discernible verses or choruses, there's the nagging suspicion that there's a pop song in there somewhere: albeit one that's been stripped apart and molested to oblivion.\n\nMuch the same is true of the remaining (and much more downbeat) tracks. No-one expects an easy ride with Animal Collective, but nothing quite prepares you for the synthesised screams - or possibly demonic laughs - that intersperse the sparse, spacey and otherwise engaging Street Flash. Cobwebs is a soulful cry across the savannah in the Foals \/ Yeasayer vein; but wilfully hamstrung by a queasy sonic heat-haze.\n\nSeal Eyeing, with its watery ambient swirls and tinkly piano, is prettier; so why the sounds of cutlery being dropped in the background? Interesting tunes, but too much treatment."}

{"text":"Dusted Reviews\n\nKnots of Sound\n\nA fuller release than the sparse, but intricate Unithematic:, Untied is at times a sloppy, yet pristine mix of the distinct sounds Languis makes home. Composed of bleeps, blops, and acoustic knocks, Languis' music is frequently compared to \"post-rock.\" If anything it's post-rock's Latin American cousin, but it breaks from the frequently stunted moods that post-rockers never seem to grow out of, plus it's not dependent on guitars.\n\nLanguis can be calm, cool, and collected, a little wild at times, and even sweetly romantic. It's a bad stereotype to say it's the Latin blood, but something is telling these guys to throw a few songs in for the girls and run from all out melancholy or Wagnerian builds of romantic joy. What's here instead is tightly composed beats that intertwine with texture, complemented by swoons of guitar, voice, and keyboards.\n\nThe guitars are drawn out drones that emerge and then fade slightly around the songs' centers. In the audible buildings of Languis' world, the electronics make up the mass of the structure with the acoustics adding flair. If anything, this is more IDM than rock, but IDM with a pop sensibility that borrows from Terry Riley's keyboard workouts and a little 80's formula of fluffy soft-rock romantic tones.\n\n\"Orange Grove,\" can't keep away from a lovely acoustic guitar that gently overlays a procession of distorted beats, which fades to a soundfield that invests itself in casio chimes, that leaps from a moog bass line, that returns to glitchy Latin percussion, that finds itself in the midst of a real drum kit, while a psychedelic blade runs its course up to the front before breaking with a gentlemen's flair to let another iteration of these elements play it's course.\n\nYou get the point: this shit is complex.\n\nSuch abuses of multitracking aren't difficult, but here it's not an excuse to throw some extra instruments over what would otherwise be a drab song. Languis design interconnecting segues that can be refashioned and put together in any such way. So built are these songs that they're audio paintings: each sound is a hue and when overlain they make a new color, drawing you further into the composition. On \"Dishes,\" strokes are comprised of pleasant feedback tones, a little conga, a background of chime-like electronics, and tones compressed to dulled knives of sounds. These tone paintings shift, never giving away their secrets while drawing focus to their central medium of moogs and keyboards.\n\nAll this said, I still prefer Unithematic's aspersions of guitar, piano, and electronics. Untied is a little too much; a wall of sound that doesn't allow you to ever fully see the wonderful things these guys are capable of. I know that Languis can accomplish great things, but here it sounds as if they threw everything into the mix at once. While that formula works when all you're assembling are simple phrases, with these cats even the most thread-bare numbers are woven from inventive tapestries. It's a fine and compelling release, but Languis' strength comes in their ability to keep you on your toes, jumping from hummable melody to melody, and not by compressing all their sound into one dense cluster, thereby losing their identity."}
{"text":"My Chemical Romance has released the second set of their Conventional Weapons project. So far, each release makes it puzzling as to how they only ended up as B-sides to Danger Days: The True Lives of Fabulous Killjoys. \"Ambulance\" embodies that of the rock orchestra that the group constructed in The Black Parade. With a powerful choir introduction that carries through to the chorus, the theatrical side of the band becomes polished by Gerard Way's impassioned vocals and glitzy guitars. The quartet went more Queen than punk on this one, and it pays off tremendously. It's a play piece to the dysfunctional circus aspect that the band displays often and is a true gem in the pile of unreleased material."}

{"text":"On the Newfound Subtlety of the Arcade Fire\n\nSo let's get a couple things out of the way up front: No, Regine Chassagne was not used nearly as much as she should have been. And yes, it's really long. Too long by a quarter, probably. This is either its fatal flaw or not a flaw at all. It's hard to say. We'll get there, though.\n\nWith the very obvious exception of Radiohead, there's not a band in the world that inspires more impassioned fandom than the Arcade Fire, and it's not terribly difficult to understand why: they've long operated under the principle that the weight of the world hangs in the balance of every note they play, every word they sing. They're good enough songwriters and bombastic enough performers that we buy into their plight and adopt it as our own, either because it was always ours, or because there's beauty in those struggles, we're sure of it. Then we thank them for offering us glorious, if also temporary, relief from them, through cathartic, explosive choruses and celebratory crescendos. It's a curious and exceedingly rare type of relationship that's been at the core of successful alt-associated bands from Nirvana to Bright Eyes. The Replacements, even.\n\nWin Butler and the rest of the Arcade Fire struggled through family issues and death on their royalty-affirming 2004 debut, Funeral, and through bouts with organized religion and other institutions on 2007's slightly disappointing Neon Bible. With The Suburbs, the struggle is between young and old, between long-haired kids and short-haired kids, between lost kids and kids who never knew enough to be lost in the first place. In a nutshell, it's an album about the quiet virtues of small town life versus the lofty ambition of city-life, and about how neither of them are ever quite what we think they'll be. But for the first time, they've released an album that's almost all struggle and very little release. It's an interesting approach, but it poses a few problems.\n\nFor one, it can make getting through it from start to finish feel like something of a chore. There's not enough variation from song to song, let alone within songs, in terms of dynamic shifts or the theatricality that's characterized their best work. The band sounds restrained and borderline uninspired on mid-tempo tracks like \"Modern Man,\" \"Deep Blue,\" \"Half Light I\" and \"Wasted Hours,\" none of which feature much in the way of their carefully honed specialities. Even \"City With No Children,\" admittedly one of the album's potential centerpieces, is essentially a single musical thought that comes to a sudden and surprisingly unceremonious end after a tidy but uneventful three minutes. The excellent but confounding \"Suburban War\" does the same thing\u2014it builds slowly and intently, then never exactly exhales.\"Ready to Start\" almost does, and \"Rococo\" definitely does, but it still feels minor in comparison to what we know they're capable of. Regine's \"Empty Room\" is non-stop, perfectly executed catharsis from the word go. It's the exception, though.\n\nThe lack of musical resolution\u2014or at least an obvious one--extends to the album's themes, too. Even though The Suburbs goes on longer than it needs to be (maybe, unless it doesn't\u2014more on that later still), the album still somehow manages to feel incomplete. Whatever it is you're waiting for all along\u2014for one side or the other to come out of those struggles victorious\u2014it never quite happens. Much of the album exists in what is, I guess necessarily, a gray area. It turns out the art school kids in \"Ready to Start\" were right to warn against blood-sucking businessmen, but the narrator of \"City With No Children\" wonders if he's any better off than the bloodsuckers (\"I used to think I was not like them, but I'm beginning to have my doubts\") and even warms to their Real World pragmatism (\"When you're hiding underground, the rain can't get you wet\/But do you think your righteousness can pay the interest on your debt?\/I have my doubts about it\"). In \"Suburban War,\" one character loses touch with a friend who cuts his hair short, signaling a change in priorities, the pursuit of a straight life that stands in opposition to the one they'd agreed to, the one they'd dreamt of. Years later, though, the still-long-haired narrator finds himself back at home, peering into car windows looking for his friend. These situations pop up all over the record, and it's frustrating. Butler recognizes the conflicts, understands both sides, then seems almost to throw his hands in the air and walk away. It's disappointing, but it's understandable. This shit is complicated.\n\nFor much of the record, Butler speaks in general terms. These aren't Springsteen songs, and they don't try to be. Characters don't have names, and they don't have particularly detailed back-stories. For the most part, we don't know how old these people are or what really makes them tick. There's a lot of talk about \"the kids\" and \"the suburbs\" as universally understood entities, and while it never quite comes off as condescending or disrespectful, it can at times seem lazy. But then there's something else to consider.\n\nThe Suburbs could have been a record that told 16 distinct stories about 16 distinct people who learn 16 distinct lessons in 16 distinct neighborhoods, and it would have been an admirable, time-honored approach that could have paid great dividends. Instead, we get a record where the stories sort of bleed into one another, where a series of talking points are repeated, quietly, over and over again, with only slight variation from scenario to near identical scenario. We got a record that simply refuses to end, a record that sometimes seems like it will never actually reveal anything to us. And it feels right. The album works the way real suburbs work: affecting change not through flashy, story-book epiphanies, but by gently tapping you on the shoulder and saying the same things day in and day out, forever, to the point where most people don't even pay attention. The Suburbs is a record about, and for, the people who do."}

{"text":"MUSIC - World joins Two Door Cinema Club\n\nThat's where the Irish trio \u2013 singer Alex Trimble, guitarist Sam Halliday and bassist Kevin Baird \u2013 holed up to work on new songs, far from where anyone could hear them, before heading to Los Angeles.\n\n\"We did the initial writing for the album in Cardonald, where we lived for a bit,\" explains Kevin, who heads back to Glasgow next week for a gig at the Barrowland.\n\n\"It was like we got all the pieces of the puzzle in Glasgow, and then put them together in LA. We have a lot of friends who left Ireland to study in Glasgow and then stayed there, so we have a lot of friends in the city.\n\n\"We also aren't able to write in London very well, there was too many prying eyes and people wanting to hear everything so we wanted to get away from our label, our agents and our managers. We love the city and Sam's girlfriend lived there, so it was pretty good for him!\"\n\nThe result was Beacon, another dose of high energy indie dance pop that went into the charts at No 2. Such a high chart placing showed how things have changed for the trio, who saw debut record Tourist History eventually go gold, but only after touring across the world.\n\nThe shows paid off, but at a cost. Kevin says: \"We've lost a lot of close friends and girlfriends, there's been a lot of casualties along the way, but we're still loving it.\n\n\"Distance has ruined a lot of romantic relationships, and in terms of friends there are people who would call you up for a chat and not mention Two Door, they just want to chat to you personally, which is great.\n\n\"But then there's the ones who you never hear from but they ask for guest-list all the time.\"\n\nThe band have clearly had some growing up to do. Yet when it comes to feeling the pressure of being pop stars they seem mature beyond their years.\n\n\"Being in Glasgow and away from London helped us avoid feeling pressure,\" explains the bassist.\n\n\"As much as the first album was successful, it wasn't a massive instant success and we weren't the band that everyone was talking about.\n\n\"We were doing well and selling records but building our fan base steadily, so we didn't have that massive hype that other bands get.\"\n\nWhat's also unusual is how the band have cracked foreign markets so well.\n\nThey are stars in America, Australia and throughout Europe, while a tour of South America is slated for the spring. It's a contrast to many bands who struggle for success beyond their home turf.\n\nKevin says: \"Musically we're very accessible.\n\n\"People can listen to our music and they won't know where we're from, whether that's America or the UK or Ireland.\n\n\"Secondly it's because we've gone to these places. A lot of the time bands will say other cultures don't get it but that's because they've not built a fan base there by gigging.\n\n\"If you keep coming back to those cities then you can build a relationship there, whether it's Paris, Sydney or Rio De Janeiro.\"\n\nAnd next up on their worldwide jaunt is the Barrowland.\n\n\"It's one of those places where it feels big, but is so intimate at the same time.\n\n\"We've always had a great time wherever we play in Glasgow but Barrowland is special"}

{"text":"Tuesday, July 22, 2008\n\nAlice Cooper-Along came a spider\n\nSPV 2008\n\nTo say Alice Cooper's career has been varied would be an understatement. He has never been afraid to take chances as far as changing musical styles. That approach has worked out with albums like \"Welcome to my nightmare\" and \"Raise your fist and yell\" but he has had far more disastrous results on efforts like \"Lace and whiskey\" ,\"Special Forces\" and others. So with a track record like this you never know quite what expect although the last few albums have generally been decent. As a whole \"Along came a spider\" is actually not all that surprising in the musical approach that it takes. That's not to say it's restrained though it's just that Cooper taps into some styles he has tried before. Tracks like \"I know where you live\", \"Killed by love\" and \"I'm Hungry\" actually have me thinking of \"Welcome to my nightmare\" and \"Goes to hell\" era Alice. Other tracks take more of modern hard rock approach or well, modern as in the last twenty years. The concept behind the album is that it is supposed to be about a serial killer named \"spider\" and follows what he does and his ultimate fate. The music is fairly varied and a brisk pace for many of the tracks helps. Alice's previous album \"Dirty Diamonds\" tried a similar approach of mixing earlier sounds from Cooper's career with newer hard rock. However \"Dirty Diamonds\" struggled because it seemed very forced, but \"Along came the spider\" has Cooper and his band sounding very natural and even more confident than he has in some time. Whether it's a heavy track or a ballad Alice just very much seems logged into his comfort zone here and that's very key. Talking about killers and murders is something that not every singer could do in this context without it sounding like total cheese. Yet Cooper has always had a knack of taking dark topics and pulling it off because that whole horror aspect (rather real or movie type horror) has always been a part of his identity. A few songs are a little more typical music wise than I would liked, but overall this release goes into Alice Cooper's stack of good releases"}

{"text":"\"Making this album was a pretty painful process,\" admits Forms frontman Alex Tween when asked about the band's follow-up to 2004's incredibly well-received, Pitchfork-approved debut Icarus\u2014and, to be honest, his comment is a bit of an understatement. Recorded consecutively over a 50-day period in Illinois with Steve Albini (Nirvana, the Pixies) at Electrical Audio and assisted by Greg Norman (Built To Spill, Pelican) at Great Western Record Recorders, the process tested the New York act's limits of the band's sonics and sanity in ways that most of us couldn't even begin to imagine. \"We couldn't afford to take one day off because we'd already paid for the studio time; all for 30 minutes of music, which works out to 35 seconds a day,\" frontman Alex Tween explains, \"but we're really proud of how it came out.\"\n\nIndeed, despite (and listening to the lyrics, maybe partially because of) all the physical and financial struggles the band- which also features guitarist Brendan Kenny, bassist Jackson Kenny and drummer Matt Walsh- endured during the recording, the disc takes the band's unique brand of post-hardcore to indescribable new levels. Fading in and out of each other like a series of dream sequences, The Forms evokes the classic Dischord roster such as Shudder To Think and Fugazi as much as it does underappreciated '90s acts like Slowdive and the Dismemberment Plan, but puts things in a more accessible pop context that will appeal to record store nerds and NPR listeners alike. \"We've always felt like we've never fit in anywhere, especially in New York,\" Tween explains.\" But things seems to be changing; people seem to be open to something a little more challenging and different,\" he continues, adding the band feel a kinship with peers such as Battles, Deerhoof and Dirty Projectors.\n\nAbove all The Forms are perfectionists (Albini himself admitted he'd never worked with a band that had gone over the same piece of tape 58 times, as The Forms did on their debut) and if anything, that attention to detail is amplified on the band's latest disc. >From the hypnotic opener \"Knowledge In Hand\" to the alternately driving and droning (in a good way) \"Red Gun\", all of the songs on The Forms are distinctively different without compromising the band's unique vision. In fact, if the album's ethereal closer \"Getting It Back\" doesn't completely captivate you, well, we don't know what to tell you. \"With this new album we really didn't want to take the easy way out and instead tried to make our ideas work as songs by having parts work with each other organically and actually make sense,\" Tween explains. \"We still tried to mess with the idea of what a song is every chance we could get, but I think the end result is a lot more cohesive and refined than the first record.\""}
{"text":"Chemako\n\nChemako\n\nUltra Sound\n\nBluesWax Rating: 2 out of 10\n\nCategorize Under WTF Blues\n\nThere are several different styles of blues albums; this one lands under \"confusing.\" It's not that you can't label it with a certain style, it's just that it is so inconsistent from one song to the next you don't know what you are listening to. The vocalists even change from male to female almost from song to song. There needs to be some sort of a foothold to steer this ship and bring the listener somewhere.\n\nThe album is a project of three friends getting together and putting an album out. Sounds innocent enough until you have to sit through it. The odd part is that most of the album has these women singing, yet they aren't pictured in the album jacket. The two songwriters are, but three women who make a large portion of the album don't get pictured at all. I guess they missed press picture day. Overall somebody had to take the lead and make this project smooth. It's one thing to have fun with friends, but remember that it's a dog-eat-dog world out there and you may be wearing Milk Bone underwear.\n\nOne of the better songs here is the Lightnin' Hopkins-ish \"Dry Your Tears.\" It's a loose blues piece with Jimmy Ragazzon on the vocals and harp. It's a lazy song that you could just lay back to and not have a care in the world about. The opener, \"Red Diamond Train,\" is a strong song with the banjo plucking the way and Shan Kowert's dark vocals leading to a swampy run of rail. Annie Acton brings her \"Tears for Breakfast\" and it's a soulful tune you could easily listen to on this album.\n\nOn the other side you have to dig through songs like \"Let It Burn Wild,\" which sounds like Kenny Loggins' \"Return to Pooh Corner.\" Loggins' song will forever give me nightmares. Why record a song that sounds so similar?!? The lullaby song of the disc goes to \"Save the Moon.\" Someone thought to put it in the middle of the disc at song number six. Not a good choice. This song makes you stop the disc quickly. Already two tragic songs in the first six! Not good odds boys.\n\nAgain, it's been said before, making an album is a privilege not a right. Focus on what you what to say and say it, 'cause the only statement that this album left me with was \"umm\u2026\""}

{"text":"We Were Promised Jetpacks: In the Pit of the Stomach\n\nScottish quartet We Were Promised Jetpacks have the intriguing ability to simultaneously pound your eardrums with a massive, speaker-shattering fury while still retaining an air of playful ambiance. The band's second studio album, In the Pit of the Stomach, is no exception. Filled with rapid-fire drums and deep guitar swells, Jetpacks' latest release isn't anything you haven't already heard from the band, but that doesn't mean it's any less entertaining.\n\nWith tracks that seamlessly transition from quiet, single-string lines to a flurry of high-gain distortion, it can be hard to keep up with the pace. Tracks like \"Through the Dirt and the Gravel\" exemplify this sonic dichotomy, with an easy-going, breezy chorus reminiscent of The Strokes. However, the verses switch it up to distorted mayhem, with drummer Darren Lackie pounding along with lightning-speed rhythm.\n\nThe band does bring it down on some songs though, such as \"Sore Thumb,\" which somehow comes off relaxing in a weirdly distorted way. While some songs like album opener \"Circles and Squares\" focus in on the group's heavier style, the band never goes over into the realm of metal. Even at their heaviest, the guitars still sound spacious, allowing tracks to breathe more and not sound like a storm of electrified rage.\n\nThe album isn't without flaws, though. The reverb-rich guitars can border on monotonous after awhile, especially when songs like \"Act On Impulse\" begin with a two-minute instrumental that repeats the same melody over and over. With the exception of the tiresome nature of some of the tracks, In the Pit of the Stomach surrounds you with billowing sound waves and will perhaps make up for that pesky lack of a jetpack.\n\nIan Birnam is the lead music critic"}

{"text":"08 January 2007\n\nHARDHITTING MUSIC CRITICISM IN 2007\n\nThis Canadian writer Robertson Davies, I just finished his 1985 novel called What's Bred In The Bone, which tells start-to-finish the life of one Francis Cornish, a rich guy who does low-level spywork for his dayjob but what he really loves is painting. Part of his comeup is mimicking the Old Master works stroke for stroke, figuring out their techniques and then applying them to his own paintings--so he's practically an Old Master painter, but living in a post-WWI art world sent into shock by cubism and friends. There's this one scene (and this is starting to sound like a Status Ain't Hood post I know but bear with me) when Cornish exposes what's purported to be Hubertus van Eyck's heretofore neverseen \"Harrowing of Hell\" as a forgery, and all the art critics who were previously praising \"Harrowing\" for its transporting beauty and its emotional depth suddenly changed horses, \"If it's modern, then whatever, fuck this painting, etc.\" Sort of like a reverse Mike Jones, or an upside-down Yung Joc.\n\nAnyway I finished this book the same day Dan Balis from Brooklyn disco band Escort sent me his latest release, \"A Bright New Life.\" My support for this band is well-documented, and \"Starlight\" was my favorite song of 2006, though I know I was living cognitively dissonant. I've struggled a bunch both publicly and privately with the point of semi-fascist throwback acts-- Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, Metro Area, Earl Greyhound, Escort, Jamie Lidell, Nomo, Antibalas, that \"Spanky\" band Joe Tangari likes, the list goes on-- and normally I said something to the extent that \"we can enjoy this semi-fascist throwback stuff but we can't reward it critically, it's not of this age, it's riding the coat-tails of certain stylized nostalgia X [heavy funk, disco, Motown, Led Zeppelin, etc.] which has had decades to accrue meaning over time, etc\" which is super-silly and insider because really all it has to do with numerical ratings and topten rankings. My bit was normally met with arguments of \"I listen not for novelty but for craft, and reward well-made songs, so fuck off\" or that brand of \"I like what I like!\" anti-critical bullshit that has no business masquerading as definitive review. Rootless music is impossible, but at least try to do something new, was my understanding; I point to my LCD Soundsystem interview as a good starting point for moving talks of \"innovation\" from composition to production, or rather understanding music's vertical space as fertile, unbroken ground.\n\nBut Christ that's a lot of work just to say, yeah, I like what I like, isn't it. This new Escort 12\" is fantastic: \"Bright New Life\" thumps steady in octaves while the singer rambles moodily and uncertainly, strings drag then get cagey as the chorus nears, then BAM all that empty space in the verse is filled with this huge horn-heavy chorus and performative \"a briyut newww life.\" It's smart songwriting, the stylized diction is perfect, all the instrumental buildups are taut, not a note out of place, no smirk in sight.\n\nI remember hearing this song both times I saw the band live and thinking to myself that they really love playing disco out--love the acrobat-like thrill of playing such soulful music so note-for-note, so tightly wound. There's such an energy to that restraint, maybe the reason I'll always prefer James Brown, who micromanaged like a motherfucker, over George Clinton, who just let it all hang out. Beside the point. What I'm tasked with once again is making it OK for me to like this song. Without being all fuckitall about it, or just ridiculously pedantic, it's really tough.\n\nSo Davies. There's this part where the guy who forged \"Harrowing of Hell\" gives this whiny but basically hardhitting semi-extended monologue that calls, basically, for absolute criticism, criticism without heed to context--and from there, calling for absolute art, art that needs no context to be understood. Again, it's all impossible, but what my good friend The Internet has done is afford more opportunities for contextless artmaking and appraisal, which brings up the usual questions: Why do genres die? Was it who, or what, that killed disco? I mean to an extent I wonder how much of it is supply\/demand, and from there how much of it is merely supply, access, presence. I'm sure one of those new books about disco has an answer too. But how much of this is a function of industry machinery? Out with the old, in with the new, etc.?\n\nIn other words, if we pretend criticism can help or hinder the newness of new music (it can't; for another time), the reason it's OK to reward semi-fascist throwbacks critically is because positive appraisals doesn't impede new music from coming along. I can see how it would have gotten pretty annoying if everybody kept drawing the same fucking Nativity scene over and over again, and there's limited space in museums and art galleries and so on, and the voraciousness of music consumers and art buyers in general all but demands the new, but all's to say I'm relieved not to be such a crank about this stuff all the time now.\n\nroughly, fascist anachronism re an aesthetic (here late 70s\/early 80s highly stylized disco boogie, with no acknowledgement of the present day) but self-actualized, not topdown (i.e. this sort of fascism is a choice)\n\nthe semi- is misleading, you're right. i should left it as fascist-like or sorta-fascist. also i owe you a sonic youth email"}
{"text":"Blog\n\nElectronic rock has never felt so much like cyborg rock as on Lower Dens' new record, Nootropics. It's an aesthetic as much as a concept, a delicate and subtle mingling of synthesized or processed or programmed sounds with a rock scheme nodding heavily to krautrock, the original cyborg rock music. And, like Michael Rother's \"Fuerland,\" the result is a strange, seductive dream, delivering more and more on every listen. Nootropics also happens to be about our post-human future, where humans live within the terror of a perpetual identity crisis: \"open fire or evolve, mutate\" goes \"Nova Anthem\". I recently talked to Jana Hunter, front-human of Lower Dens, about the growing fear of a future that's already crept up on us.\n\nCan you talking about \"brains without names\"? I think as a lyric that's about the most reduced snapshot of the ideas behind Nootropics.\nIt started as something as a lyrical placeholder. I knew I wanted the song [\"Brains\"] to be about anxiety over technology, like the very modern kind of anxiety over artificial intelligence. I'd be listening to some NPR stories and reading elsewhere about Cleverbot and other AIs that were starting to defeat the Turing test, or approaching that line.\n\nTo me, it's kind of a goofy lyric and it was much more goofy when it was the only lyric in the song. It is the simplest reduction of that idea, that around the corner there are entities that are nameless and unknown and that's what makes them terrifying. They're not us; they're something else. Maybe something better and more capable than us, and maybe less human. Obviously less human, not having the characteristics we associate with humanity. Just more unknown. Those uncertaintities are what are frightening about them. I did know that I wanted to start with that idea, but the lyrics needed to go a bit farther than that kind of silly catchphrase.\n\nHow different do you think these new beings will actually be?\nI think that that very much remains to be seen. I think that human beings have a tendency to create things to suit their environment as much as possible. I imagine that if we maintain control of artificial intelligence, it will be as much in our likeness as possible.\n\nThere's some talk about escape and sort of re-primitivization in the record's lyrics. There's a lot of dread of what's coming. Is this how you feel?\nIt wasn't so much my dread as an observation of dread in others. I tend to be more on the enthusiast side of technology. I hate that my phone and my computer sometimes seem to control my life, seem to have more of a leash on me than I do on them. But I believe in my ability to find ways to manage that. I think humans are generally capable of finding ways to incorporate new technologies into our lives that are only beneficial. Obviously, a lot of people don't feel that way and that is kind of what I am more fascinated by \u2013 that tension, a kind of very primal tension between the fear of the unknown and the future.\n\nIt's ultimately about not wanting to let go of animal nature. Wanting to strike a balance between that and endless possibilities."}

{"text":"Thursday, 21 June 2012\n\nCassette Culture in the 80s\n\nYou know what it's like now: a lot of exciting bands are getting their first release on tape. Things were a little different in the late 80s.\nThe photo shows some of the tapes I bought (and, in one instance, was sent free) between 86 and 89. In the indiepop scene then, there was a format war. This centred on 7\" singles being idealised both aesthetically and economically, with a concomitant hatred of 12\" singles.\nThis skirmish manifested itself most playfully in the Sha-la-la label, who released six-and-a-half-inch flexidiscs so the listener couldn't use a record player's auto-return and had to physically interact with the record for each play.\nThe cheap and disposable ethic of flexidiscs was an extension of the tape scene,\nwhich was an incredibly important part of the post-punk DIY movement. Tape culture embodied punk's ethos of being cheap and easy, only more so: they were even cheaper and easier to record and release than vinyl.\nThat episode in cassette history was strongest in the early 80s. From about 1986 onwards, compilation tapes became really useful in hearing those bands you'd read about in fanzines or kindred spirits to bands you already liked.\nIt was incredibly difficult back then to hear unreleased bands or even bands who had a record out. Unless John Peel played a demo tape or you stumbled across a new band at a gig, or you lived near a cool record shop that stocked the pop underground releases, you just couldn't hear a lot of new music.\nCompilation tapes were vital in the indiepop scene back then. Look at that photo. There's Like Flies In The Face Of, an essential round-up of the Australian pop underground; there's Akko-Chan's Anorak Party, compiling the Japanese scene; and there's Something's Burning In Paradise, which had hit after unheard hit.\nThen, like now, there were new bands with cassette-only releases. Keen I found out about from a compilation tape and bought their own tape. They later released two records. Similarly, Emil I discovered through a compilation tape. They released one tape ep and that was the end of that.\nThere's a collection of St Christopher demos there. I bought that on mail order from the band. All money went their way. At that point they'd released three (self-funded) singles and a flexi in four years. Maybe that's something for downloaders to think about next time they grab music they could otherwise buy.\nPrimal Scream? There was a stall in Camden Market that could meet most of your bootleg needs. It was the only place to find Tomorrow Ends Today. Of course, if then were now and it had been uploaded, then I'd have rather bought a download from the band than line the pockets of a market stallholder.\nThe Cannanes had a catalogue of records and tapes. An album-length tape could be had for less money than an import 7\". It made sense to the 13-year-old me.\nThe Shop Assistants? It was in the sale. The last tape I bought when there was a vinyl alternative. Again, this was economic.\nThe Telescopes? Their first demo and some live recordings. I used to correspond with one of the band members because she wrote a fanzine. She sent me that free, along with some pointers to music new to me.\nWhy am I describing each of these tapes? Because tapes tell stories; MP3s don't.\nNaturally, I'm delighted that in 2012 there are so many great new bands getting their music out on a physical format. I'm not calling out any of these bands or their labels as hipsters; though I don't doubt that's the motive for some, I don't believe it's the inspiration for any of the music I buy.\nRecords are expensive to buy. In the past decade, the price of 7\"s has rocketed, not least due to the unfortunate ebay culture and some labels marketing them as fetishistic objects with inflated collectors' prices.\nI know some people who run record labels are losing money hand over fist by releasing records to a dwindling record-buying public. The audience is there, but the money from that audience isn't.\nI don't expect that a tape release will ever sell as many as a record would, but a tape sure as hell won't lose the label or band money like a record would. Economies of scale dictate that the smaller the pressing run, the more expensive the record. The more expensive the record, the fewer potential buyers and the more money the label loses.\nI don't love tapes. But if it's the only way for bands to get a physical release without them or their label going bankrupt, then I'm onside"}
{"text":"Outside anything found on a Greatest Hits album, a definitive Smiths song. Musically, lyrically, attitudally. It's one of the first songs Morrissey and Marr wrote together, one of the first to be performed and recorded, and one of the first to become controversial for absolutely no good reason. Musically it's a perfect example of The Smiths' odd and instantly memorable sound, a combination of bouncy melody and distinctly unbouncy front person performance.\n\nThe tune is, according to Johnny Marr, \"a Mancunian anaemic Patti Smith Group,\" an homage to Ask the Angels. Not a connection I would have made, but if Johnny Marr says so. Either way, it's extremely boppy and can be danced to. At the same time, in typical early Smiths manner, Morrissey is singing from his own corner of the universe, seemingly unaware of what anyone around him is playing, sounding flat and completely off-beat. Morrissey is in fact one of the least musically inclined rock stars, never having mastered any instruments and possibly a bit tone deaf, and in the lifelong habit of composing his songs on the typewriter, as opposed to at the piano or on the guitar like most songwriters do. He's gotten immeasurably better over the years both at singing with the musical accompaniment instead of on top of it, and writing songs with some built in sense of rhythm, but his early songs were peculiarly unmusical and sung in a deliberately amateurish manner. All of which is precisely the charm that makes The Smiths still relevant and beloved. Because they didn't sound like anything else before or since.\n\nHandsome Devil contains a fistful of classic and oft-quoted lyrics, including \"let me get my hands on your mammary glands,\" and \"a boy in the bush is worth two in the hand.\" Even though the subject is addressed as a 'handsome devil' it sounds distinctly like the subject might be a female, not least in the reference to mammary glands. By the references to exams and things bookish and 'scholarly' it sounds like this handsome mammary-gland-haver is involved in higher education of some kind. Perfectly rational things to write songs about, all that. Why the English press flew to the conclusion that child molestation was the topic, I can't imagine. There are other Smiths songs that are definitely about child-related unwholesomeness, like Suffer Little Children, which is about a real-life kidnapping and killing spree. Or Reel Around the Fountain, which is more ambiguous, but decisively sleazy all the same. Handsome Devil seems pretty innocent by comparison \u2013 it's only about chasing after someone who, since she's old enough to have mammary glands 'eager to be held', is presumably not a child. How anyone could come to any other conclusion is beyond me, but it did lead to Morrissey having to take a public stance against child molesting \"and anything that vaguely resembles it.\" Pretty absurd."}
{"text":"The Bishops: The Only Place I Can Look is Down\n\nA lot of people wish that there were still truly innovative bands out there, like the Beatles, changing their sound with every release. Some bands have decided that the best way to overcome this problem is simply to imitate the Beatles whole-heartedly. Hell, it worked for Oasis, so why not a scrappy young British trio calling themselves the Bishops? Yet what that group doesn't realize is that Oasis managed to capitalize on the Lennon-McCartney dynamic and make it wide-screen and cinematic, perfect for their peak late '90s alternative audience. The Bishops are doing nothing more than trying to re-write \"Help!\" over and over again. Their debut American release, The Only Place I Can Look is Down has not a single original note, idea, or second that's worth mentioning. Sure, the chord changes of \"In the Night\" could have been replicated during an Ed Sullivan broadcast, but the throngs of screaming girls wouldn't have been very impressed. No band is ever required to be innovative, but it doesn't hurt if they try at least something relatively inventive. A better idea? Go see a Beatles tribute band\u2014it'll sound more authentic."}

{"text":"Related articles\n\nIn February of 2004, Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly appeared on the cover of Spin alongside his counterparts in The Distillers, The Darkness, and Interpol. The theme of the accompanying article was \"Next Big Things\"\u2014and Thursday was painted, for neither the first nor last time, as \"emo saviors.\" At the time, emo was just breaking through to a larger audience, which only compounds the irony of Thursday's uneasy career arc; when the band formed in New Jersey in 1997, emo was still an underground, nebulously defined offshoot of hardcore that encompassed everything from gentle, melodic songcraft to screaming, atonal chaos. Thursday synthesized all those elements. And its sophomore album, 2001's anthemic Full Collapse, thrust Rickly and crew into the spotlight just as emo was seeping into the mainstream, thanks to bubbly contemporaries like Jimmy Eat World and Saves The Day.\n\nAfter leaving indie Victory Records and signing to Island Records for 2003's scathing War All The Time, it became clear that Rickly wasn't interested in becoming anyone's savior. Nor was his band desirous of being the next big thing. As the decade progressed and emo became even more of a punchline, Thursday seemed to retreat into itself, choosing to record a string of challenging albums that incorporated everything from prog complexity and post-rock texture to lit-major Easter eggs and Situationist sloganeering. 2008, though, saw the band reach a crossroads; after leaving Island, Thursday began recording its most elaborate, accomplished album to date, Common Existence, with famed indie-rock producer Dave Fridmann. Before the album was completed, Thursday signed to stalwart punk label Epitaph. At that point, with the waning trend of commercial emo about as vital as the music industry at large, it would have made as much sense for Thursday to dissolve and fade away as it would have for it to continue.\n\nBut Rickly, keyboardist Andrew Everding, bassist Tim Payne, drummer Tucker Rule, and guitarists Tom Keeley and Steve Pedulla weren't ready to be the next casualties from the class of '04. With Fridmann again at the dials, they wrote and recorded the entirety of No Devoluci\u00f3n\u2014the group's sixth full-length\u2014in a spontaneous session unlike any Thursday had tried before. The album shows it: Cracked, caustic, and somehow ethereal amid all the corrosion, No Devoluci\u00f3n is an about-face from the note-perfect intricacy of Common Existence. It's also one of the most brutally emotional pieces of music from a band once pegged as the most of emo of them all. And yet, No Devoluci\u00f3n falls far outside the mall-punk paradigm, drawing from a broad sonic palette even as it sinks into a withered, world-weary heartache. But, as Rickly tells The A.V. Club, there's a lot more to No Devoluci\u00f3n than meets the ear.\n\nThe A.V. Club: No Devoluci\u00f3n is the first album Thursday has completely written and recorded since returning to an independent label. Did that have any effect on the whole process?\n\nGeoff Rickly: Yeah, I think that having Epitaph support us so strongly, especially relative to how many records we sell compared to some of their other acts, really helped. They stand by us so firmly. When we were on Victory and then on Island, there was a lot of talk like, \"We stand behind these guys. They sell a lot of records.\" But it was also sort of implicit that [if] we don't sell a lot of records, they don't stand behind us anymore. Having the support of a label that really cares and really loves the records and is going to provide a home regardless of how many records we sell, that made a huge difference. It's a very stable environment for us, emotionally speaking. Which is good. We're a six-piece band, and we're from the New York\/New Jersey area, so we're pretty neurotic. [Laughs.]\n\nAVC: What about on an identity level? Even though the divide between major-label bands and independent bands isn't as sharp as it used to be, Thursday came up in a DIY climate. Did you feel more like yourselves again after leaving Island?\n\nGR: I think that nails it. With all the labels we've been on\u2014especially the major label, which is weird\u2014I never felt like we weren't free. If anything, we weren't really encouraged to do what we wanted to do. It was kind of like, \"Yeah, you guys can do that, we guess. We were kind of hoping you'd be this band, but you want to be that band.\" [Laughs.] Being with Epitaph has made a lot of our choices, which we'd second-guess on a major label, easier. Now we don't have to worry so much about the ramifications. Like, we'll be shooting around the idea of giving away a record for free, and Epitaph will say, \"Yeah, that would be fucking awesome. Cool, let's do it.\" It's really weird for a label to say, \"We'll pay for you to give something away.\" It makes me feel a lot more like when we started the band. We didn't have any expectations or a career to think about. It's very freeing. Epitaph is excited about music instead of just crunching numbers all the time.\n\nAVC: Speaking of expectations, Thursday fans have a lot of them when it comes to your music. And yet, the band always seems happy, even driven, to undermine those expectations.\n\nGR: You say \"undermine,\" but we always used to say \"subvert.\" That was sort of our catch-all word. We've always been like, \"We can give people what they ask, but at the same time give them the opposite of what they ask.\" Or at least that's what we've tried to do. But we kind of got ourselves in a position where we became adversarial toward everybody. That was sort of our natural inclination. For a while there\u2014for years, actually, through Island and even past that\u2014if anybody got the least bit heavy into giving us a suggestion, we'd become reactionary and just go the opposite way, I think at times to the detriment of the band.\n\nAVC: How so?\n\nGR: Well, for example, War All The Time is such a pissed-off-sounding record. It's so dark and claustrophobic. The album before that, Full Collapse, wasn't like that at all. It was a big, hopeful, young-sounding record. But that was all gone by the time we put out our first major-label record. We knew Island was expecting something more like Full Collapse, something the kids would love. We were like, \"Fuck them, and fuck the kids.\" We were just on a \"fuck this, fuck that\" rampage, I guess. [Laughs.]\n\nAVC: What about now? No Devoluci\u00f3n doesn't feel that way at all.\n\nGR: The new record is the first one we've made where I feel we didn't try to play off of expectations too much. Which is weird. While we were trying to be subversive, we thought we were doing our own thing. Like, \"This is us. We're out making our own identity. We're not following anybody's rules.\" Then you start to realize that once you've gotten yourself into an opposition stance, they're still dictating the terms of what you're doing. You're not making any real decisions for yourself. You're just going against the grain for its own sake. That's sort of fatiguing for a band to do for a bunch of years in a row. Luckily we got ourselves into a better situation now. Without the expectations, all of a sudden we have to make positive choices and directions for ourselves. There's no negative pushing back at us. We're not defining ourselves in terms of the other. I guess that would be the postmodern theory of it all.\n\nAVC: There are also the scenes and trends Thursday has been associated with over the past decade. You've influenced a huge number of bands\u2014some of them good, a lot of them terrible.\n\nGR: [Laughs.] That's almost exactly how I would say it. There are some good bands out there that love us, and that is awesome. But there are a lot of bad bands out there that love us, too.\n\nAVC: That said, the whole mall-punk thing seems kind of pass\u00e9 in 2011, a relic of the last decade. It's not a relevant way of looking at things anymore.\n\nGR: No, not at all. It's really weird. I think a lot of those bands got really careerist for a while. I remember hearing this popular phrase at one point in the punk or whatever you want to call it community. You'd be at a basement show, and there would be some loudmouth saying, \"I don't even care. I think it's more punk to just want to sell a million records.\" When I'd hear people say shit like that, I'd find it totally annoying. All these bands followed the guidelines about how to make it big by dumbing things down and making them more immediate and being more pop, but that's not how you sell records, at least not in the long run. That little formula that they had going just isn't relevant anymore. So now you have bands left that are still playing in that sphere\u2014something that grew out of punk that isn't punk anymore, but not post-punk\u2014and they actually love it, and they try to find something to do with it that's worthwhile. It's not a way to get famous or have girls after you or whatever anymore. It's kind of interesting that way. The bands left now are the ones that actually care about the music. A lot of the bands that came in and had hit records and took all the money out of it have disappeared, and it's become a little obvious what they were up to the whole time.\n\nAVC: Between this shift in the scene and your signing to Epitaph, it seems you had a blank slate to work with going into No Devoluci\u00f3n. Did that have anything to do with how much of a departure the album is?\n\nGR: It's really hard to say if it was as premeditated as you might think. The truth is, we didn't really have songs ready to record when we were supposed to. We tried to cancel the session with Dave Fridmann, and he kind of called our bluff. He was like, \"Fuck you guys. You usually spend a year writing a record, and you over-think every little thing. And by the time I'm recording it, you guys are already moving on past it. No, you don't get to reschedule. You're coming up here. I don't care if you have one song written. You're going to come and make this record. Just trust me on this. If you blow it, we can try again later. But just come and do it.\" Basically we were seven days into writing, and we had a record. I'd finish writing lyrics literally right before walking into the control room and singing the whole song. From the beginning of writing lyrics to having a finished song would take four hours.\n\nAVC: How did that work out?\n\nGR: I think that kind of spontaneity made a lot of difference. In the past we've had some similar ideas to what we did on this record, but I would usually say, \"Let's think about it. Is it going to be fun live? Is it going to have enough energy? Does the chorus hit? Let's make it more angular. Let's make it more juicy-sounding.\" I would manipulate the song until I thought it was a good extension of what Thursday was doing. I think that was a little heavy-handed. So this time, I backed off. I didn't write any guitar parts. I didn't go in and try to dictate to the rest of the band what things should sound like. I let them be a band, and I just wrote lyrics for them. I think that was a huge leap forward. There was no musical director. The strengths in every player were just allowed to come out in different ways. I wasn't in there trying to say, \"Oh, that doesn't sound like Thursday.\" Those guys are all really capable players. They're so good. I just love to watch them in a room and not sing over it, just to see them do what they do. A lot of the album was just letting go of what we thought we should be. It's funny, because I hear people say, \"I knew they would make a change, like Muse or something.\" We've toured with Muse, but we don't sit around and listen to them. We've been listening to Kate Bush and old 4AD stuff. I guess it's not what a lot of people might picture the guys in Thursday listening to. When we remove a little of the identity of what Thursday is supposed to sound like, and we go with the music that actually does influence our lives on a day-to-day basis, this is what comes out.\n\nAVC: The influence of early 4AD bands is definitely all over No Devoluci\u00f3n. It's very atmospheric, and your vocals wander around and get buried in the mix a lot.\n\nGR: That's funny, because half the kids who listen to Thursday will probably think, \"These songs are great. Why did Dave Fridmann ruin the mixes?\" That's so crazy. They might not realize that Dave is a total genius. None of this stuff is a mistake. We know how much we're compressing the drums. If you have great headphones or a great stereo, and you're listening to it from the real CD, the drums sound unreal. And they're not sample-replaced. They're not fake. They're real. Every mix, we would even watch it on the oscilloscope. Everything would be interplaying so much. It was like, \"If you turn up that keyboard and this snare drum and then put the vocals here, and all three of them hit the same note on this chord, they all kind of blend together. You can't tell what's a voice and what's a drum and what's a keyboard.\" We started getting into these complex arrangements of chord-stacking between the instruments. We were using the overall compression of the mix as harmonic distortion, using the studio basically as another instrument to play new chords and new voicings. If anyone says these songs would sound better if someone else had recorded them, I'll say, \"These songs wouldn't even be these songs without Dave's recording.\" He was a part of the band making this record. Someone might think that, compared to a Muse record, No Devoluci\u00f3n sounds shitty. But Dave could have made us sound like Muse if that's what we'd wanted. We'd do mixes that were super clean, and we'd be like, \"This sucks. This just doesn't move me.\"\n\nAVC: There's also a lot of friction there, too, between that ethereal feel and how raw the album sounds. Just because something is atmospheric doesn't mean it can't be\u2014\n\nGR: Abrasive.\n\nAVC: Right. Was that contrast something you were going for?\n\nGR: I never really thought about it that way. If we'd had more of a premeditated idea of what this record was going to sound like, then yeah. Maybe Dave did. I know he had a bunch of ideas about how this record was going to be, how it was going to be different. He usually records, like, the Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev and MGMT, and those bands all work within the same area, just different sides of it. We're pretty much the only band like us that he does, so he likes to experiment each time. Once we got into the studio, he said, \"Oh, I see what you guys are doing this time. You're not trying to push it into the post-hardcore-whatever territory.\" We were just going with a certain flow, with a certain feeling we were trying to get. I think he just saw what we were doing on that first day, saw where we were going, and he got it. So maybe he was clear about that atmospheric-yet-raw sound more than anything we were consciously going for.\n\nAVC: You mentioned a certain flow or feeling you went with while recording. Is that how you normally work?\n\nGR: No, it's the opposite of how we usually work. I used to put up slogans and ideas for lyrics all over the studio. Wherever you went, there were these little notes stating the theme of the record, so that everyone was confronted with that all the time. This time, I just waited until the mood was there and kind of picked it out of the air.\n\nAVC: Did that have a bearing on the lyrics?\n\nGR: Yeah. I mean, I knew what I was going to be writing about, no matter what. I just had a few major life changes happening at the time, and I knew it was unavoidable that I'd be talking about those things. I just didn't know how I'd be talking about them. And then the record sort of decided that it was going to be more subtle, that I wasn't going to go full, exploratory confessional, where I'm painting every little detail of every little picture. I realized I was going to be doing a lot more subverting story formats. Like, \"A Darker Forest\" has the clich\u00e9 about taking two different paths, but then it turns it upside down and says basically, \"No matter which path you take, you're still wandering around the fucking forest. Whatever moral you want to get from that story is a false moral. You're going to be lost forever.\" What does that make you think of? [Laughs.]\n\nAVC: It made me think of The Cure.\n\nGR: Yeah. [Laughs.] After I wrote that song, a friend of mine was like, \"Oh, 'A Darker Forest,' like 'A Forest' by The Cure. Only darker, right?\" And I was like, \"Shit, that's funny.\" I was born a Cure fan, always will be.\n\nAVC: Back to the lyrics, what were some of the life changes you were going through while working on No Devoluci\u00f3n?\n\nGR: Well, I think there are a lot of pretty obvious allusions on the record to a marriage on the rocks. That was a pretty huge source of inspiration. While this was all going on, I really didn't want to write, like, part two of Cursive's Domestica. I didn't want this to be this heart-wrenching record about breaking up. I mean, I love Cursive, but I knew I didn't want to do that. It's just such a thing, you know? The breakup record. I hardly ever hear a breakup song and think, \"Yeah, I know what you mean.\" Most of the time I just think, \"You sound like a self-absorbed douchebag.\" Domestica is one of the few records that gets it. But this isn't Domestica. This record is about devotion. It's like being in a desert and writing about water. Even if it's make-believe water, I'd rather have some of that around than just write about sand. A lot of the songs are about how incredible devotion is, how incredible all the things we care about are. It just became this huge theme for the record. It's a huge love letter. It became so much easier to write once I realized that. I think I was about four songs in before I realized what the album was about.\n\nAVC: But it isn't all about the positive side of devotion.\n\nGR: No. It's like a prism, and we're dropping devotion into it. We're going to get all different colors from it. There's a bar in Fredonia, New York, that one of Dave's friends owns, a little rock 'n' roll bar called BJ's. We were there, and I started telling Tom [Keeley] about what the record was about, and he was like, \"Yes, that's perfect. Now I don't feel scared about making this album.\"\n\nAVC: It's interesting that you just made a thirsty-in-the-desert analogy, seeing as how one of the album's standout tracks is \"Empty Glass.\"\n\nGR: Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.\n\nAVC: Of all the songs on No Devoluci\u00f3n, it's the one most blatantly about the breakup of a marriage. But even then, you're subverting what's expected of a song like that.\n\nGR: Right, the two different ways of losing a wedding ring. I like that. Somebody who heard the song asked me, \"Did all those things actually happen to you?\" And I wanted to be like, \"Well, obviously not.\" You either lose your wedding ring or you sell it. I wanted the listener to be off-guard. Is this real? Or is this just a song about what it feels like to go through this? I didn't want people to know whether or not they could take it literally. Like you said, it's subversion. I wanted to subvert the form of the narrative. You can't trust the narrator. Those things excite me as a writer. I love it when you're listening, and you're right in the palm of someone's hand, and then all of a sudden you're given a reason not to trust them anymore.\n\nAVC: It's also the quietest, sparsest song on the album, so most of the attention is on your vocals.\n\nGR: It's like you were saying about how the vocals get buried sometimes. But other times, like in \"Empty Glass,\" they're so loud, it's insane. To me, it's all part of the story. I said that this was a record about devotion more than a breakup record, and it needs to have all the parts of devotion in it. Going through those rough spots, that's all part of devotion. I couldn't just leave that out because I wanted to tell a different story.\n\nAVC: You've written a lot of songs in the past about religion. Is that one facet of the devotion you're picking apart?\n\nGR: Not really.Devotion really is such a weighted word that way, though. But I also think real love\u2014the kind that's far beyond infatuation\u2014is religious in every way. Whether or not I'd say I was a humanist, I've always agreed that every person is about as sacred as it gets. I've always loved Kurt Vonnegut and Mark Twain and that whole viewpoint of humanity being a church unto itself. That's something that probably comes across most on this record, at least as far as a religious aspect. I was raised Catholic, so a lot of our other records have issues with faith and guilt and all kinds of stuff you grow up with when you're Catholic, all tangled up with sex and death and whatever else. This album is a little less concerned with that. I'm not really thinking about that right now.\n\nAVC: You've never been shy about dropping literary references in your songs. In fact, each new Thursday album seems like a chance to see what Geoff Rickly has been reading the past couple of years.\n\nGR: [Laughs.] That's why I like Twitter now. I know a lot of the time bands use Twitter for, like, \"Here's a good review. Here's a link to a song.\" It's used as a promotional tool. I love Twitter because whenever I finish a book, I can be like, \"Go read this. It's great.\" To me, that's cool. For so long, I think I was unsure about my voice, so I just dove straight into the literary and lyrical side of things. The written-word part of it was more important to me. If you could read the lyrics and get it, that was always a big thing for me. I didn't want it to be like, \"He's just singing about some shit.\" I wanted people to be able to sit down the lyrics and read and listen.\n\nAVC: Has that changed as you've grown as a singer?\n\nGR: I don't know. I still love the written word just as much.\n\nAVC: Are you cutting back on the overt literary references?\n\nGR: Yeah, definitely. There are more nods than actual references. I think \"A Darker Forest\" uses details the way Cormac McCarthy might. The lyrics focus on little things that change the movement of what's happening. The plot or whatever. That's my favorite part about McCarthy's prose, especially something like All The Pretty Horses, where there's seemingly nothing going on. But everything's happening right under the surface. And \"A Gun In The First Act\" is obviously a Chekhov reference. I was also reading Richard Powers' The Echo Maker. I really love how it talks about symbols, how they have the tendency to break down the true value of what they represent. Everything becomes a symbol for something else. A leaf falling from a tree means mortality instead of it just being this beautiful leaf. There were a lot of things like that that went into the writing of this record. It's weird, though. I think I've gotten to this place in my life where I'm not pushing that stuff in our music anymore. I don't think about it so much. It just naturally comes out in what I'm doing, whereas I used to see something that got me excited, and I'd want to write a song just so I could put some of those ideas into it.\n\nAVC: As for musical nods on No Devoluci\u00f3n, the end of \"Turnpike Divides\" sounds like a tribute to \"X-French Tee Shirt\" by Shudder To Think. Was that intentional?\n\nGR: Yes! You totally got it. That's what I was going for with the vocals. I wanted to do this really long, really complex repeating melody, this kind of up-and-down arc. Just like the end of \"X-French Tee Shirt.\" That's always been one of my favorite vocal lines. The crazy thing is, I was in the studio, and I started singing it, and Dave goes, \"You're kind of doing like a Shudder To Think thing, aren't you?\" And I was like, \"Yeah, man!\" And he said, \"That's really weird. I was just recording OK Go, and he was doing that, too. He was trying to rip off the end of 'X-French Tee Shirt.' But the ways you guys went about doing it is completely different. You'd never hear your song next to their song and think there was anything in common. It's just funny that these two records I've worked on in a row reference the same 15-year-old song, this song that nobody knows.\" [Laughs.] I love Shudder To Think. They were so on their own kick. They had this way of being so apart from even the cult of Dischord Records. They were the weird band on Dischord. Even if you liked Dischord in the early '90s, you probably didn't like Shudder To Think because they were too weird for you. [Laughs.] But once you tap into that wavelength, you're like, \"How did these guys comes up with this shit?\"\n\nAVC: In contrast to all the atmosphere and allusions and experimentation on No Devoluci\u00f3n, the next-to-last song, \"Stay True,\" is pretty straightforward. It even feels a little like a pep talk. Is the album less dark and heavy at heart than it might seem at first?\n\nGR: Definitely, yeah. To me, there's a lot of joy on this record, especially in comparison to what we've done before. Some of our old stuff is dark, and there are songs on No Devoluci\u00f3n that are just as dark. But I think this one is more representative of the whole range of emotions. There's longing and joy and determination and all kinds of things. Puppy love. Whatever. There are so many weird things we're trying to fit together on the record. I love the cover art being all white. To me, the idea of white as the combination of all colors is what we were going for. While they were working on the cover, they reversed it so that it was all black, and I was like, \"Wow, that looks like a Depeche Mode record. But no. That's not what we're going with. That's not this record.\" We've been talking about it, and we don't want to write another record anytime soon. I don't know what happened while we were making this, but something went right. Usually by the time a new record of ours is ready to come out, I'm already thinking, \"What's the next one going to be like?\" [Laughs.] But I just want to keep playing this record for a long time."}

However, Salad's lyrics are more mainstream (and make sense) and the music is less pyschedelic and more vaudevillian (in the same way as Jon Brion, Liam Hayes and Wings stuff - but filtered through indie rock).

The song titles of each parallel track go together, forming a sentence or in some cases two words that relate to each other and to the story. Overall, the point of this album is not to prove the existence of fate, or to disprove it. It's a discussion of life, of loss, of trial and error, of success within failure, of failure within success, of the struggle between your actions and your feelings, and how those don't always go together. This Is How The Wind Shifts is a journey that jumps around but stays cohesive, with underlying meaning and stories that have a real human meaning and cater to the soul. \" \u2013 Vocalist Shane Told"}
{"text":"One of Germany's rock pioneers, Achim Reichel founded the beat-era Rattles, Germany's answer to the Beatles, with Herbert Hildebrandt in 1960. Military service drew Reichel from the band, but upon discharge he continued his musical career with the pop group Wonderland. However at the start of the '70s, his interests in Eastern philosophies coincided with the burgeoning progressive trend. Teaming with lyricist Frank Dostal, first up was the just plain weird Wonderland Band. The story really begins in 1971 with Die Gr\u00fcne Reise (The Green Journey), the first album under Reichel's new moniker, A.R. & Machines. Billed as a \"soundtrack to the intended motion picture\", the album is certainly a trip. Reichel recorded the album by himself, adding voice, percussion and electronic effects (Dostal provided the lyrics). Of course \"Machines\" refers to the tape recorders that made up Reichel's signature \"echo-guitar\". He layers guitar line over guitar line into a very hypnotic effect, and effectively predates just about everyone that came after (Fripp, G\u00f6ttsching, Schickert, etc.). \"Sch\u00f6nes Babylon\" for example is truly resplendent; it's a completely different take on the kosmische. There's also a hippie vibe throughout the record that could be seen as strength (\"I'll Be Your Singer\") or not (\"Come On, People\"). Yet twangy, mantric and certainly psychedelic, the album is Reichel's own progressive twist on rock-n-roll, culminating in the whacked-out \"Truth and Probability\", where Reichel now layers his voice through the tape machines! The album saw release on Polydor, as did the following year's double-album opus, Echo. Produced again by Reichel, the album enlisted the services of Conny Plank as engineer, and a host of guest musicians. With the \"Machines\" hypnotic echo-guitar in full force, it's mostly augmented with acoustic guitar and tabla rhythms, and Reichel's deep baritone croon, however Lucifer Friends' Peter Hecht's orchestration is sublime. It's an unprecedented set, certainly one of the most massively amazing albums of the era. Reichel then setup his own Zebra imprint with Polydor, releasing a variety of artists, including Kin Ping Meh, Ougenweide and Randy Pie. He would release a few more A.R. & Machines albums, including the excellent IV in 1973; however by mid-decade Reichel's involvement with the progressive would be limited to that of a producer and label head, as his (very successful) solo career would pursue more commercial grounds."}
{"text":"Searching For Luke's debut record \"Lock Inside A Key\" contains 12 tracks that is shining from both rubies and stars. The melodies linger like seaweed and the nylon stringed guitar is murring on in a kind of early Leonard Cohen-drive. A ringing harp is lighting small lanterns in contrast to the singing voice that's crispy, dark and moist. Sometimes a cello lay in the back round and the strange, sliding sound of a saw appears like a daydreaming housewife whose husband gone to sea.\n\nThe album feels like it's marinated in seawater and there's a lot of rainy songs in there to. Searching For Luke's lyric fills your head with pictures and the melodies do often flow into a dark lullaby chorus with shades of romantic cynicism. \"Lock Inside A Key\" is a cottage, warmed up with crackling timber, to enter a crystal clear autumn night. The songwriter periodically paints and therefore she decorates the album with her own artwork.\n\n\"The instrumentation which is mostly acoustic guitar, cello, harp and saw begins to make sense as they chorus together adding an elemental feel to everything, a slightly unhinged undercurrent. She is at her best when throwing on the black robes - 'Trees of Misery' draws everything towards it, instruments swirling with a negative energy, her vocals world-weary; like Heathcliff mourning Cathy calling across wild moors, it is certainly the diurnal desires that she is interested in.\""}
{"text":"The Bewitched Hands\n\nFrance's radio quotas require that thirty-five percent of music on young stations be sung in French. Unhampered, countless French indie rockers press on proudly in broken, illogical English. The Bewitched Hands don't have that problem. They've mastered the English language, as well as a particularly anthemic blend of indie rock.\n\nThis six-piece, which originated in Reims, has been playing together since 2006. The members had been friends for years playing in multiple projects, but ever since they inaugurated the Bewitched Hands they haven't been content to hunker down within the city limits. They've moved beyond the Champagne province to tour the US and UK. They're directly informed by the Pixies, Arcade Fire, and Supergrass, and they're a living lesson to French acts looking to get noticed by the world at large.\n\nBut that's not to say they've abandoned Reims. They're still around as much as they can be, playing out with friends in the Shoes and Libelul. We went to see a hometown show at the 106, and ended up discussing the burgeoning local scene and the stroke of luck that brought them together."}
{"text":"The self-titled debut album from Puerto Rico's Los Vigilantes doesn't do them any kind of justice. Don't get me wrong. It's a completely vital piece of garage punk en Espa\u00f1ol. But you do not know what you are dealing with until you've seen the San Juan quartet live. I'm talking about Carbonas\/Oblivians levels of sonic annihilation.\n\nA salient piece of biographical information here is that their drummer Rafa has spent most of his musical career in hardcore bands. But it also helps to know that guitarist Jorge Mundo played lead guitar for fellow PR garage punks Davila 666 on their first tour of Europe and their second (and rockingest) album Tan Bajo.\n\nSome time after you've seen them play, when you are asking yourself what happened and if it was real, pick up the album, preferably on vinyl, and the true face of the band will be revealed. Tumbled into their snarling organ-laced swing is a touch of rockabilly, a whisper of surf, and some sweet, sweet doo-wop meant for slicking back your hair and cruising around for the kind of action you know you'll have to explain to someone later. So, like, they have a sensitive side, you know?\n\nFew bands today are as burly and yet shamelessly cornball in their songwriting as Los Vigilantes. On \"Ven Vamos\" they're a bit of both:"}

{"text":"Loney Dear \u2013 Dear John\n\nLoney Dear mastermind, Emil Svanangen, does not want his voice to overwhelm you, offend you, or make you uneasy in any way. His vocals are practically padding, meant to cushion any of the harsh edges of his multi-layered brand of synth-pop. Listening to his latest, Dear John, one gets the feeling Loney Dear could probably record his vocals with a sleeping baby in his arms if he were so inclined. This approach to singing would not be so noteworthy were it not belied by his seemingly antithetical approach to instrumental arrangement. Dear John is full of songs that are almost obsessively packed with sound. It is as though Loney Dear made it a mission to fit every synthesizer setting available into this album.\n\nThe effect of this dichotomy is initially quite unsettling, especially considering that the beginning of Dear John is quite frenetically paced. \"Airport Surroundings,\" with it's speeding drums and dramatic minor key synths, is obviously designed to immediately capture the listener's attention, but Svanangen's sings as though he has little desire to be heard. A similar method is employed on the second track, \"Everything Turns To You.\" Even as Loney Dear displays that his voice has greater range than you may have suspected, the synthesized orchestral strikes command the listener's attention with much greater ease than the effete vocals. It's almost like watching a hectic car chase with Jeremy Davies at the wheel.\n\nThe rush of Dear John's first two tracks is a bizarre precursor to the sweet-natured melancholy that follows. This is not to suggest that the album suffers for the lack of frenzied synth-pop beyond that point, but \"Airport Surroundings\" and \"Everything Turns To You\" will likely give you the wrong idea about Dear John's direction in the remainder. Appropriately, the song following begins with the line, \"I was only going out to catch my air,\" as if to mark the moment of the album at which Loney Dear relaxes the pace, which is a relief. It's doubtful that Loney Dear's voice could keep up with the tempo established at the album's outset, and likely that listeners would find that approach tiresome.\n\nIn fact, Dear John's finest moments arrive when Svanangen accepts the fact that there is little to no danger in his voice. Of course, no one would want to describe their singing as docile or glum, but down-tempo weariness simply suits Loney Dear, as songs like \"I Was Lost\" make plain. Dear John has any number of songs that would make fantastic singles, but the album suffers as a whole for Svanangen's countless attempts to overdress his music in melodramatic synths and effects. \"In A Silent Sea\" simply does not need the vocoder that irritatingly trails the melody, but Svanangen's desire to establish Dear John's modernity likely drove him to include the effect. Conversely, \"Summers'\" anthemic highs benefit from a more patient approach to arrangement. If Loney Dear can tone down his impetuousness and let his melodies breathe a little, he might fully realize the potential that is obvious throughout Dear John."}
{"text":"Categories For This Article: 5 Reasons Why You Should Buy..., Columns\n\n[With the new release of Live At Stubb's, Volume II, reggae\/rap artist Matisyahu breaks down the Top 5 reasons you need this live album in your collection.]\n\n1. Lover's Rock\n\nThe first reason why you should buy Live At Stubb's, Volume II is because the music is pretty unique. There's a very unique sound. I think one of the draws that my music has had is that I grew up listening to multi-genre sounds like so many of today's youths. We grew up listening to hip-hop music but we also listened to rock music and reggae music. So the style that developed from what it was five or six years ago to where it has gone, it's just the continued evolution. It's still a blending of the different styles but I think if you're a reggae lover, you're gonna love it. If you like hip-hop, electronic music, rock music, it just has all those different aspects to it.\n\n2. Scoops Of Variety\n\nIf you're someone who likes pretty much any style of music, this is really a cross-genre form of music. I think if you're a music lover, someone who likes music, you'll really dig it. One of my favorite moments on the record is during \"Two Shot, One Drop\" which is a song that was released on an EP I put out but never released on a full-length. It's one of those moments during the show where I just remember sticking it. I was right in the pocket, right in the moment, in the words, in the music, listening and just really there. I think that's a good song.\n\n3. Dubble-Up\n\nAnother reason you should get the album is because the band that I'm playing with is called the Dub Trio. And they're amazing. Dub Trio is a Brooklyn-based group. They started out as a dope reggae-rock group. They were a very heavy metal band and they also do hip-hop, programming beats. They use dub in sort of whatever genre they're playing in. So we really incorporate the dub sound in the main element of the music we make. Regardless of what genre it is. It's pretty unique because dub is something that's mostly used in reggae music only.\n\n4. Back Where I Belong\n\nThe fourth reason why you should buy the album is because it takes place at the world famous Stubb's Bar in Austin, Texas. When I first started out, I was in a religious school in Brooklyn and I had left the area and started doing shows. I got an agent and booked a tour. During that first tour, I signed a record deal and we recorded our first record at Stubb's, which was sort of an unlikely place to record the record. But at the same time, in a sense, Austin is a real city that seeps in music and music culture. And Stubb's is a great venue, it's been around for a while and so in a way it made a lot of sense. It ended up doing really great. I think to this day it's one of the highest-selling live records of all-time. So we wanted to revisit and go back to that place.\n\n5. Blow Your Horns\n\nThe final reason this album is worth buying is because it starts off with a shofar being blown. A shofar is a ram's horn that [is played during the Jewish New Year]. The Holy Day. A friend of mine came and blew the shofar on the album."}
{"text":"The Duke Listens To The Cure's Self-Titled New Album - Page 3\n\nIf there's anything here to surprise the listener, it's the fact that it all hangs together so convincingly. As for the actual A to B of how it sounds, well, that's not much of a surprise at all, to be honest. Of course it was going to sound like this. Throw Robert Smith and Ross Robinson into a studio and this is the kind of nonsense you would assume they would create.\n\nIt's an album that grows somewhat upon repeated listening, like the new record by Jesse Malin what The Duke waxed so eloquently regarding a few days ago. The difference is that Malin's record eventually appears much more straight-forward than the production would initially suggest. Here, it's the opposite sort of shindig, with what at first appears to be all stripped-back, raw and so on, actually being something of a fa\u00e7ade, masking the wealth of intricacies that eventually pop up in the mix.\n\nIt's like one of those magic eye pictures, except instead of getting a headache and seeing a donkey after forty hours, you get some brilliant tunes revealed to you. You might still end up with the headache, though. I mean shit, this gets pretty loud at times.\n\nThere are nods to the indulgences of old, most notably in the ten minute finale, The Promise. Sure, maybe it's all the musically ingenious in the world, but I'm fucked if I could remember much of a damn thing about it after it was finished, other than that it was very long, and sounded like something from Wish, one of the tracks you skip past in order to get to Friday I'm In Love, but what you still put down as one of your Favourite Cure Recordings Ever if anyone asks.\n\nFriday I'm In Love? Fuck off, man, you wanna hear some of those ambient b-sides what stretch out for twenty-two minutes, is what. I mean, really, man, what kind of sheep are you anyhow?\n\nThe Cure isn't really a return to form, since the band have never really been especially far from The Form in the first place. It certainly sounds more passionate than the last few releases, up to and including liberal spatterings of fuck-words here and there. It's less indulgent, some of the stuff even hinting at a kind of brevity. It also makes those claims about how Goth The Cure are sound even more ridiculous. The songwriting wonderments on display here and throughout their back catalogue are beyond anything ever attempted by, I dunno, The Merciful Sisters or whoever. All those other folks what sing about the despair, medieval England and so on."}
{"text":"BBC Review\n\nSingles charts Suede's rise from mesmerising indie newcomers to guitar-pop veterans - and demonstrates that the band have always been one step ahead of the competition.\n\nIn 1992, Melody Maker proclaimed Suede \"The Best New Band in Britain\". At that point the band hadn't even released an album. Heck, they hadn't even released a single! Now, it wasn't the first time the music press had got a little bit over-excited about a band, and it certainly won't be the last - but how many of those bands are still going strong 11 years down the line? Not many, that's for sure. Suede aren't your average band, as this Singles anthology testifies.\n\nThere are some quite brilliant tunes here; \"Beautiful Ones\", \"Animal Nitrate\", \"Trash\", \"The Wild Ones\". The list goes on, in fact this album sounds like an authoritative lesson in how to release singles. From the very first, \"The Drowners\" (released in 1992) to current single \"Attitude\", Suede's chart offerings have always oozed a kind of sexy suburban charm.\n\nLyrically, there's not a lot to get excited about; mainly sex, fashion, and suburbia, but this does create a cohesion that's often lacking in compilations such as these. That's not to say that Suede's music hasn't evolved over the years. On the contrary. New tracks \"Love The Way You Love\" and the aforementioned \"Attitude\" sound like a band in full creative flight, exploring new ideas, and looking to the future.\n\nToo often bands release compilations that don't really reflect the quality of the material they're picked from (Manic Street Preachers, take note). By releasing Singles Suede have done exactly the opposite. Reminding us how great they were, how great they still are, and promising greatness yet to come. What more could you possibly ask for"}
{"text":"ABOUT THIS ALBUM\n\nAlbum Notes\n\nVocalist Lisa Huffman takes you into her world with powerful lyrics and her unique, captivating voice. She shines equally bright on raw, gripping songs such as \"Sinking In\" and and on more ballad-esque songs such as \"Fly\" and \"Beautiful Day\".\n\nDeathpop is the band's most collaborative songwriting effort to date. Scott Dippel's strong guitar work continues to drive the bands unique style, and Greg Coan's bass work sets the foundation while allowing intricate guitar lines to flow in harmonious spaces. Scott Nickell continues to lay down the driving drum tracks which provide the engine that drives each song. Lisa Huffman shows off her multi-talents, for the first time providing keyboard and synth tracks that texture songs, play off her wonderful vocals, and take this Panic Attack release to the next level."}
{"text":"Music Review: Loreena McKennitt - A Mediterranean Odyssey\n\nIt doesn't happens very often (and too bad for that!), but there are times when you hear a piece of music, a guitar, or a voice for the first time and the whole world seems to drop away for that moment. During the days of radio, this had the tendency to ruin the music obsessive's day: if the timing was just right, a wait of up to an hour or more in the car would be required. Before things like satellite radio, we had to rely on the DJ to back-announce the previous set.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to me the first time I heard Loreena McKennitt. During the last few minutes of my morning commute, a local college radio station played her version of \"She Moved Through The Fair\" from Elemental. Those slightly ominous bells and that angelic voice sent me off to another world, one where informative disc jockeys didn't wait too long to fill in the missing information. Well, the kids from Emerson College radio came through, almost 30 minutes after I had parked my Toyota pickup in my company's parking lot. Hey, they don't actually enumerate all of the 'legal' uses for flex time!\n\nI can't quite remember if I went right out looking for a copy of Elemental that afternoon, but it wouldn't surprise me if I did. When a new sound enters my ear parts in such a manner, I'm driven to alleviate that tension.\n\nAlmost 20 years later, I'm brought right back to that moment with the release of A Mediterranean Odyssey. It's not often that I recommend box sets to the neophyte but in this case, McKennitt has produced a spectacular collection that serves to illustrate the scope of her back catalog while shining a bright light on the current state of her career"}
{"text":"Posts Tagged 'dr. gonzo'\n\nWith their latest album 'Dr. Gonzo', they bring back the big club vibe with a bunch of heavy kick drums and random weird shit that they do best. The release follows on from their last album 'Tons of Friends', which seemed to get a lot of negative feedback EVEN THOUGH it wasn't that bad. I guess when you're at the top of the game, people just expect you to always do better than the last effort. Having said that, Dr Gonzo is what Crookers fans such as myself have been waiting.\n\nMost of the album was already released in separate EP's, however there are a few gems that make it worth buying the entire release."}

The rest of the quartet involves drummer Deantoni Parks and keyboardist Nicci Kasper.

{"text":"Review\n\nComadre is a local band from San Carlos, CA, which is on the Peninsula of the Bay Area, about 30 minutes south of San Francisco. Like the diverse area they come from, Comadre's music is scattered around the world of emo, post-hardcore, and indie. When I articulate this mixture, I don't mean the generic Thrice copies from Southern California. Comadre sounds like Saetia if they didn't take themselves so seriously, with the dancey, sassy stylings of The Blood Brothers. Am I digging the scene points hole bigger and bigger by drawing these comparisons? It'd seem so from this apparent name dropping but Comadre is definitely above that. Their sound, which is still gawky and goofy like an immature 14-year old, holds great promise.\n\nThe Youth, as an album title sort of describes the eager and awkward sound Comadre holds onto. Saetia was a band that was really into making a huge artistic statement. Pretentious lyrics, dramatic dynamic shifts, and insane emo screaming helped Saetia leave their legacy as a respected band. This description fits Comadre but for different reasons; they are young and make fun music, as opposed to the tortured-artist pieces Saetia put out. Their song titles are pretentious because they are funny, not poetic and dramatic. One, \"Are You Guys Telling Jokes? I Like Jokes,\" is a quote from the Family Guy episode where Peter becomes a feminist, and \"City Slickers Part 6\" is an apparent ode and mockery to Billy Crystal's \"City Slickers\" movies. Sure, these are done by other bands, usually in the grind category, but Comadre adds a little more flair to the style by having music that is incredibly upbeat and dancey for being emotional hardcore at the endgame. The band jumps all over the map with dynamic shifts, but instead of going from the repressed arpeggiated melodic sections to the chaotic, frenetic screamo sections, Comadre will go balls out for half a song, and then finish the song with chanting and drumming only. The most notable chant, \"It wasn't gravity \/ It was the witches\" is ridiculous, but ends up being one of the most memorable and lovable parts of the album. They've turned the melodrama and hyperextension of typical emo and screamo dynamic shifts on their head by doing it their own way. And the screaming. The screaming is the exact same as Saetia's. Juan, the singer lets it loose like there's something gnawing on his grundel. My only gripe with the vocals is the recording quality. The vocals were mixed awkwardly or recorded with a bad microphone or something, leaving the vocals limp compared to the other tracks. I understand the intention of using the strategy of mixing the vocals to a lower volume, but I think it's done poorly here. They just don't cut. Good thing Juan makes up for the lack of production value with some balls out screaming.\n\nAside from presentation and construction, the instruments are pretty cool. They are varied enough from song to song to keep the CD flowing and even stand out at a few moments. It's not overtly technical or anything like that but the guitars have tasteful flares and prominence. The bass is pretty cool. It spends a lot of time adding density to the sound. Other than filling in harmonies, the bassist does a lot of minor and major 2nd hammers and pulls, leaving a sort of undulating rhythm underneath it all. Good choice. The drumming is decent. The drums do a good job of pacing the songs and I like the straight forward beats in the chant sections but like I said, there's no freak out factor. Comadre doesn't try to be technical. In fact they don't \"try\" to do anything (other than rock?). That's where their appeal lies. They're fun. They manage to pull off emo with a sense of humor. Few bands can do that well. Comadre does, excepting the poorly chosen cover of \"I Think We're Alone Now.\" I just don't dig covers. I'll admit, it translates well into a live show. Comadre brings the rock and doesn't stop live. They mostly play in Community Centers and the like, so it's a really personal show, and there's a lot of group chanting and fun for all if you catch them anywhere near the Peninsula. Comadre has a chance. Their style has promise, but is still incredibly youthful. With maturity though comes, better mixing, better musicianship, and better choice for covers. How about some K-Ci and JoJo style slow jams? I wouldn't mind hearing these guys cover \"All My Life.\" I wonder if they take requests.\n\nRecommended Tracks: Mess With the Best, Undress Like the Rest; Remind Me Never Stick My Hand Out the Window; Are You Guys Telling Jokes? I Like Jokes.; The Trials; I Sleep With My Eyes Open\n\nI finally found a picture that represents the album online. The CD doesn't have a formal cover or anything so the CD itself is used. Anyways, these guys' knew CD is coming out soon. It sounds more punk these days.\n\nI'm from NorCal too and know these guys. They played a cafe down the street from my house a year or two ago, and me and my group of friends were the only ones there. Ever since then, we've been going to a lot of their shows in both the bay and Sacramento and have come to know them.\n\nComadre has always been one of those bands that has no real peer. Their music is so unique and creative, it never gets old. And, as to having \"not enough emotion\", go to a Comadre show and tell me the emotion isn't there. Comadre shows have been some of the most crazy shows I've ever been to, simply because of the energy and emotion they pump out.\n\nYa whatever. Carlmont. But for real, I've been to a bunch of shows and I think energy is very different from emotion. They're fun, intense, and exciting but they're not hella skramz. They're just fun. My favorite song by them has become \"Sweet Thing.\""}
{"text":"The Favours\n\nThe Wrens\n\nAttendees\n\nThe key to **The Wrens**' success is probably patience, though perhaps by 'the key to their success' I really mean 'the reason they're still together'. Their refusal to change from their emotionally-charged indie-rock roots and go radio friendly after a label buyout in the mid-'90s led to them being dropped, and by the time they'd found a new home and written and recorded a third album, seven years had elapsed, and almost another four have passed since then. Tonight they discover they haven't been forgotten.\n\nBut first: The Favours, fronted by Sara Sanchez, for whom the phrase _\"butter wouldn't melt\"_ was seemingly invented. They might look innocent enough, and the first part of the set is somewhere between The Cranberries and The Cardigans on the sugar-coated pop-rock scale, but the Hull quartet soon raise the volume with some crunching power chords and big choruses, though the prominent harmonies and big smiles still leave a syrupy layer sitting on the surface. The four mild-mannered musicians end the set in a hail of feedback and instrument slinging regardless.\n\nThey don't stand much chance of competing with the headline act tonight though, although you wouldn't know it from The Wrens' first four minutes. The two guitarists play at each other over looped effects from opposite sides of the stage, once they've both finished playing with the mass of pedals in front of them, and all is sedated until bassist Kevin Whelan takes centre-stage just as the song kicks in and the wall of noise gives way to frequency-filling rock.\n\nSome more on Kevin Whelan: he's completely bonkers. Only a minute after he picks up his bass guitar he stops suddenly and slings it face-down across the stage towards his guitarist brother and wrestles his jacket off as the song continues, now bass-less, around him. One song later and he again sheds his bass as, screaming at the gawping audience, he runs to the front of the stage and flings his instrument towards them. He might still have hold of the strap, but the first five rows of people in front of him don't know that, and as they duck they're buying into everything The Wrens have to offer tonight.\n\nAnd they do have a lot to offer. Soon 20-plus people are plucked from the audience, handed drumsticks and invited to pound the floor, microphone stands, anything in time to the song as the band sit amongst them. After that, the band invited a 'fifth Wren' onto the stage to help them out with 'Hopeless', and the 6Music competition winner still looks wide-eyed, petrified and dazed when he emerges in the crowd come the end of the night. This isn't just a band playing to an audience; to some these four 30-slash-40-somethings are heroes, and the respect involved is almost palpable.\n\nElsewhere, the stomping riffery of 'Everyone Chooses Sides' packs even more punch live than it does on record, a perfect fusion of old-school emo and rock, whilst 'She Sends Kisses'' chorus soars effortlessly. Vocalist Charles Bissell continues playing with his effects between songs, joining them together with little touches of prog, and having gotten bored of tuck-jumping across the stage and subsequently climbed the speaker stack a few moments prior, Whelan takes time out from hurling things at people to sit in solitude at the piano and solemnly deliver the brief 'Propane' alone. Come the second encore, Bissell sings the first verse of set-closer 'I Guess We're Done' from backstage, phoning guitarist Greg's mobile, who in turn aligns it with his guitar's pickups, Bissell barely audible through the buzz of static and radiation.\n\nI entered the ULU tonight armed only with the knowledge of their history I gleaned from their Wikipedia biog, but I left with the desire to purchase everything The Wrens have ever released. I want to hug them and I don't know why. Perhaps this is a message for any band that.\n\nYeah! And that's exactly what I did the first time I saw them (erm, last year was it?). The Wrens were selling Secaucus and their other 90's releases homemade style. Oh, and they invited all the clubgoers to an afterparty which was kinda cool, eh?\n\nBut at first you're thinking here's a bunch of over the hill\/past their prime rockers, and the first song isn't at all convincing....but then somewhere shortly thereafter you realize you're watching one helluva great show. My young buddy had never heard the Wrens and he quite possibly was more enthusiastic about it than I was. A 10\/10 might be a tad generous but I'll not be the one to quibble; fine review."}
{"text":"British Alternative Rockers\/Electronic collective Breton have released a video for their single, Interference. The song features a prominent, recurring vocal loop, over enthusing beats. Originally formed as a group of filmmakers, the outfit turned to music to write their soundtracks. The combination of audio and visual elements is tantalizing, yet relieving. Keep an eye and ear out for these guys, there's a lot of potential brewing in Breton."}
{"text":"The Long Tangles - Silver City (Overhead)\n\n\"Matrimony rock.\" Hmmm. As a music critic, I'm down with all sorts of genre hybridizing (i.e. chamber-pop, glam-pop, jazz-rock, etc.). It's part of our job to make up those descriptors to give music some sort of mass understanding, so I've seen a lot of bogus combinations, but the first time I came across the term \"matrimony rock\" was on the Long Tangles' Myspace page. It seems to me that the word \"matrimony\" would contain certain connotations that act against the word \"rock\", thus neutralizing the whole ordeal. The same way your best friend becomes a kitschy version of his former badass self after taking the plunge, the Long Tangles sound soft and comfortable on their debut LP, Silver City.\n\nThe central elements to this band are the drums, synthesizer, and the nice vocals of Courtney Hans, which outline all nine songs on the album. Given that this duo is a two-piece and spent some time on the road last summer, it's probably safe to assume that the tunes on Silver City were road tested and then pretty much left unchanged when it came time to record. But the things that musicians rely on during performance \u2014 such as atmosphere, audience, and sheer volume of sound \u2014 don't necessarily translate onto record so great. It's an aesthetic choice on the band's part to spice things up for the record, or leave it in its true form. Unfortunately for the Long Tangles, their lack of studio flourishes leaves much of their would-be catchy material sounding flat.\n\n\"Hey, Silver City\" is a bright album opener of pretty piano pop and while it has certain redeemable qualities, such as the staccato chord plunks at the end of each bar (which you just don't hear enough of), it all sounds conveniently mechanic. The same sentiment runs through \"100 Years Ago\", \"Creases & Folds\", and \"Ask Her\", which also have some questionable lyrical choices. For example: \"You've gotta know that it's something you're built to do\/ a bomb's not a bomb 'til it goes off like it's built to do,\" from \"100 Years Ago\", and \"You won't even answer\/ so maybe you should ask her\/ if it is okay to give me a call,\" from \"Ask Her\" don't really wiggle and shake with deep emotional sustenance. It doesn't matter how good you can sing, if you don't feel the lyrics, the audience won't buy it.\n\nIf the Long Tangles struggle to remain interesting on the indie rock side of things, they've at least got the \"matrimony rock\" down. The standout tracks on Silver City give themselves more to the idea of \"matrimony rock\" \u2014 whatever that would be (I think of UK electro-pop group, the XX). There's tension there, and when the Long Tangles are creating that tension is when the listener tunes in. \"Dry Room\" contains the first bit of songwriting that sounds organic and natural. \"Ode to the Wrecking Ball\" and \"Falling\" both relish in a swath of keyboard swells and breaks, while lead singer Hans elocutes about relationship failures and successes. Real stuff.\n\nThe Long Tangles have a lot going for them. They've got catchy material, they sound good live, and at the very least, they have a wave of hype after a very successful first year as a band. The fact that they have pumped out an EP, Blueprints & Maps, pulled off a brief summer tour, and managed to record and release their debut LP all within the span of a single year is amazing. Having formed in January 2010 from other disbanded groups, that's a lot of progress for a short amount of time, all of culminating the release of the delightfully poppy, yet reserved, Silver City."}

{"text":"The Bureau files.\n\nThere's a pretty wide range of styles on the album. There are uptempo, danceable tracks, but also some rockers and a couple melancholy ballads.\n\nCracchiolo:Well, I write in phases, and I always try to write a crop of songs that's different from the ones that came before. For me, the post-punk time is so apt because this really is just more complicated punk rock. If I hear a band and it's straightforward and uptempo...I mean, I'm not talking about bratty, screamy punk-rock shit. I'm talking about stuff that's a little smarter and more mature than that. That's the stuff that gets me really excited, but by no means is it all that I listen to. And it all finds its way into the writing at some point. I mean, Jamie loves Steely Dan.

[Laughs] The way Jamie and I joined the band was that we worked at a comic book store together, and between the two of us and our manager at the time, the place was basically like a non-stop rock opera. It was ridiculous. Like, parody lyrics to Rush and Queen and the Doobie Brothers constantly."}

{"text":"Ellie Goulding's got a new album out and to help promote it her label organised some interviews in a reasonably swanky hotel so we went along to have a bit of a chat with her about panthers, popstar hair and Skrillex's tea-making skills. Perhaps you'd like to have a read of it below.\n\nQuestions: Michael Cragg\nAnswer: Gouldo\n\nShall we have a chat?\nYes.\n\nIf your first album 'Lights' were an animal, what animal would it have been?\nMy goodness. Erm. Oh my god, I was not expecting this. I don't really know, no one's ever asked me that\u2026 It was a cat. Because cats can be vicious and cats can be really powerful. I've seen cats jump off really tall things and land fine.\n\nWhat animal is 'Halcyon'?\nLion.\n\nNot a panther?\nOh I like that more. I used to have nightmares about panthers. Once someone told me that the forest next to my house had a panther in it, or a black cat. From that day I started having nightmares that I was being chased by panthers and from then on it sort of ruined everything because I didn't like going walking by myself or cycling or anything for fear of something \"grrrr\". Apparently you're supposed to do this (lifts coat up over her head like she's making a sail). It's to make yourself look really big and scary.\n\nWould you actually do that if you saw a panther?\nNo, I'd run for my fucking life.\n\nThis new album of yours seems full of emotional wreckage. Was it difficult to make and write?\nNot really. For this record, I don't know whether it shows or not, but I felt like I had a much stronger vision for it. In the sense that even though I sort of had no idea what I was doing but at the same time, I did. A lot of people have been asking me about whether there was a lot of pressure, and there wasn't really. Even though 'Lights' did well and I'm really proud of it, it's also really na\u00efve and sort of thrown together. It wasn't something I ever really intended to release as an album in the sense that I was writing it even before I had a record deal. It's a mix of things I've written since I was really young, but with this album I felt like I was much more focused and committed to things. On the first album\u2026It's like when I did my first essay at Uni and I thought 'this will be amazing, I'll get a first for this' and it came back and it was average and I was really like 'wow' and taken aback, and I realised I needed to put a lot more work in than I did before. I don't know why I think of that comparison but I think I remember that feeling of being na\u00efve and thinking it was a lot better than it was.\n\nWas there extra pressure because you'd won the BBC Sound of thing and a Brit award?\nYeah. I think there probably was but at the time I didn't really notice because so much was happening. Then one day it was like 'the album's coming out next week, yeah? Cool'. (Laughs) That was all just an intense time for me. All of a sudden my album was being reviewed by people I didn't know. I think it was the personal aspect of people talking about me as if they knew me and that kind of threw me off a little bit. I found it very hard to take in. Reviews are a funny thing.\n\nDo you read them?\nYeah, I read them, but mainly just out of curiosity. I find it quite amusing when people are so so wrong. Just so far away. Talking about where I grew up and they get little facts wrong. I'm really intrigued by some people's interpretations of what I do.\n\nWas there any pressure from your label to work with Dr Luke or RedOne or anything?\nNo no no.\n\nHow do you think that would have worked out?\nWe probably could have made some good songs. That was never really my thing. I think my label knew that.\n\nYou're on Calvin Harris' new album aren't you? Along with just about every other popstar.\nI think it's one of the first songs he's written with someone. He's written a lot of songs by himself. I mean, he's really really clever. I've always been a fan of him and we used to have the same management, ages ago. He's done well for himself. We wrote that song in his flat about a year ago now and then we sort of scrapped it and came back to it and re-recorded it and there was a bit of confusion around that song for a bit. A lot of artists have to write an album, do promotion for it and then it comes out and then you do things for a bit and then another album, but he's got to the point where he can just say 'I can do what I want'.\n\nWas there a turning point where you thought 'I'm getting rid of this mousey blonde hair arrangement and dying it pink and wearing black mesh trouser and cornrows'? Or did it just come with growing up and getting more confident?\nWhat were you wearing two years ago?\n\nThe same as today, to be honest.\nYeah? Quite similar. (Sighs) I don't know, I change what I wear all the time. When I was younger I was a bit of a goth, then I went through a point of rebelling against the rebel or whatever I was and became quite girly and dyed my hair blonde from black, which took about four years. And now I'm kind of a mixture of that really. I genuinely feel for the first time in ages really comfortable with myself. I went through a point where I was super skinny and I felt like I had to be I don't know, that I had to\u2026 It was actually more convenient to be fit for touring and stuff. I just feel really comfortable with myself and I feel like I don't have to be anything.\n\nThe cornrows caused a lot of fuss didn't they?\nCornrowgate! I don't know what the big deal was really. I've always had this mane of hair everywhere and then all of sudden it's gone and I'm practically bald, maybe it just looked a bit odd for everyone. But it was very convenient because I didn't have any hair in my face, I didn't sweat as much and it was a delight. I think people are very eager to talk about my reappearance and stuff.\n\nBut you did say that the Active Child cover was a turning point for you and a new direction, so people were primed for that.\nIt's definitely the first new direction people heard, but I've been doing side projects with other people for the last two year that people haven't heard yet. Ever since I put out Your Song, that was the point where I was like 'right, time to do other stuff'. So I went and worked with Billboard, who produced 'Hanging On', and I've made a bunch of stuff with him, made stuff with Skrillex, made stuff with people that I met through him and I've just been having the time of my life as a singer because my voice is so much fun and I can do so much stuff with it. I'm singing on stuff that people don't know is me because it's been manipulated so much.\n\nThe American success of the single 'Lights' is a bit of an odd one, isn't it?\nI don't know if I should tell people that it broke the Billboard record for the slowest climb up the chart. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. I remember when we sort of started to talk about America and it was quite daunting for me. But it was never 'we're going for the big push, we're going to America and we're going to break you, raaaaaar'. We did a very small show in New York and one in LA and realised that they were absolutely jam packed and then we realised it was just from them hearing about me from the UK. Then it built up slowly and I was doing big shows and then I sort of left and came back home to write the new record. Then out of nowhere 'Lights' started climbing the charts.\n\nDo you think it was helped by the Royal seal of approval? Americans seem to love that lot.\nI think I definitely got attention around that and people were like, 'Ellie who?'. Then I did SNL and stuff from that. But it just made people go 'ah, cool, she's nice'. But it really was a very slow process. I think people were predicting that I would blow up in America [after the Royal wedding 'gig'] but it didn't happen like that. The last year or so has been going between doing stuff in America and doing my album.\n\nHow was the wedding? Was it the most surreal thing you've ever done? Or was it just like any other kind of wedding? A bit of over-the-dress fondling on the dancefloor and everyone avoiding the creepy uncle?\nNo comment. Here's the thing, I know everyone wants to know about it, but I don't want to talk about it. I didn't sign anything [to keep quiet], but I just want it to be the one thing that I can keep to myself. We did have a lot of fun. My band were there and they let us stay afterwards. I played some covers and played some songs from the new album and that's quite daunting you know, especially with songs people don't know.\n\nDoes Skrillex make a good cup of tea?\nHe does! He actually does. He knows I love my tea. He tries to make me drink coffee and I don't drink it. I love the smell but I can't bear the taste.\n\nA few years ago Popjustice ran a cruelly-ignored-when-it-came-to-awards feature in which you unpacked a vacuum cleaner. In the feature you are sporting a 'Skrillex' atop your head yet people assume you've copied him. Does that annoy you?\nI invented it! (Laughs) I mean, when I first met Skrillex it was a bit awkward. Loads of people are getting it now. I've decided to grow this one side out now. I've had it really short for the last year or so because I'm starting to miss this side of my hair now. It's been a while you know. That picture is really old. I tried a wig on the other day for a laugh and it had hair on both side, obviously, and I was like 'ah, I miss it'. (Mimes stroking imaginary hair)\n\nPopstar hair is confusing. Who has hair? Who doesn't have hair? Is it a wig, is it extensions\u2026\nYou'd be surprised. It's really difficult because you have to have so much maintenance with your hair when you're on the road and your constantly doing stuff with your hair. You're always having to put product in it and glue hair extensions to it.\n\nAnd Marina's hair broke off!\nYeah that's what she said to me. Actually, here's the thing, before she dyed her hair blonde she had this beautiful brown hair and we have the same hairdresseer and I saw her and asked her what she was doing and she said he was dying it blonde. I said to her, 'I just want to let you know that dying your hair blonde, from experience, will make your hair fall out' and she did it and it looked amazing and then apparently it snapped off. So kids, don't bleach your hair.\n\nDid you send her a text just saying 'I told you so' perhaps with a sadface emoticon? (Laughs) No, that's mean. But yeah, it does damage your hair a lot.\n\nCan we talk about 'I Know You Care', which is really rather beautiful, and paired with that new video is basically one huge blubbathon.\nI know. That film [Now Is Good, which is about a teenager dying of leukemia] man, have you seen it? Even I can't watch that because I relate it to that film. It is a good film so do see it but don't go if you're feeling depressed. I wrote that song about my dad but people have been interpreting it in different ways and I've had quite a lot of tweets about it. People saying 'oh, it's just like when two people break up and they don't want to but they know it's for the best' and this mutual sadness, but there's a valid reason why two people have to break up. I wrote it with Justin Parker who wrote 'Video Games' and he's a really clever guy and sometimes people just bring out that really sad thing in me. It really depends on who I work with.\n\nDo you think secretly he just wants to write a big banger and everyone keeps turning up in tears wanting to exorcise some demons? (Laughs) Yeah. The thing is, on a serious note, when I used to talk about my dad in interviews I wasn't very nice and I was quite bitter and still very angry because he sort of just stopped\u2026 I mean, I don't even know where he is. It just frustrated me a lot, but now I'm sort of over it.\n\nThe title is quite generous isn't it? Was the working title 'You Massive Arsehole'?\nIt's sort of a denial thing. When you're constantly saying to someone 'I know you care about me' or 'I know you still love me', and a lot of the time that's not the case, sadly.\n\nDo you think knowing what the song is about is important or matters? I am in a similar position where I haven't seen my dad for ten years and when I first heard that song I thought it was good but didn't connect with it in the way I do now.\nSongs like 'Anything Can Happen' are open to any kind of interpretation. The reason why I did that video is because I think that song is either about jumping off a building in euphoria or waking up and thinking 'today I'm going to start a new life' or whatever, but songs like 'I Know You Care' and 'Explosions' are way more specific. But then again the film that it's in is about someone who falls in love right before they die, so the people who chose that song obviously interpreted it in a certain way. I suppose, I don't know, if that song makes people feel better, like if it made you feel better or feel like you're not alone or whatever then that's good. I like the idea that it helps someone out. That's what music does for me.\n\nDo you ever worry about exposing yourself, emotionally? (Laughs) This is why it makes me laugh when, like, Popjustice said I was the least controversial popstar. I thought that was hilarious. If only you knew!\n\nWhere do you think this perception's come from?\nBecause I'm a good liar. No, I don't know. Now people think I've changed into this different person and I don't think I have.\n\nPart of it's you just going out with someone new isn't it?\nNo, but he's not my boyfriend just specifically for that. Aside from the music he makes, he's my best mate. He's my favourite person. It's quite simple really. It's not complex.\n\nBut from a public's perception and people looking in these are the sort of things that can change people's opinions.\nOh yeah, totally. But yeah, exposing myself. I feel like if I started censoring my own songs it wouldn't work. I have to be honest. I don't think anybody would ever say to me, 'I don't want you to write about that'. No one's ever said that to me. But maybe the next record will be a bit more cryptic or maybe it will be even more honest.\n\nCan you talk everyone through the time you fell off a Segway? How is that even possible? (Laughs for ages) I'll tell you the story. We were in Miami and I was performing for Richard Branson actually. He wanted me to go and sing for him at the Versace mansion and it was nice and lovely. Then we had a rare day free so it was my manager's idea to go on the Segways and I was a bit worried because sometimes the more confident you are the bigger the fall is. So I had these paps following me around so I had that pressure and then someone said we should ride out onto the beach. So I'm riding along and Chris my guitarist was in front of me and Segways are quite shit; you can't go uphill, you can't go downhill and all you can do is ride forward. On a more serious note, the person who invented them killed himself on one. So I saw Chris start to fall and I burst out laughing and I lost control. People have lost fucking limbs on those things, they're that dangerous. And the paparazzi knew it was going to happen as well. We carried on and then we got to these rocks and I fell off again! My head was about an inch away from a sharp rock and my manager was white as a sheet and he didn't talk for about an hour."}

{"text":"They share their name with a typically riotous Marx Brothers movie, but Portland's Horse Feathers are a rather more sober proposition. Centred on the light tones of songwriter Justin Ringle, Horse Feather's breezy folk tunes are generally pleasant without ever reaching out to really grab the listener. Much of 'Thistled Spring', their third album, rattles along prettily enough, all trilling piano, flowing violin and rolling banjo, as Ringle's paper-thin vocals float over and alongside. There's the occasional curio in the arrangements, such as 'Cascades' deployment of faint musical saw, or the buried backing vocals sunk deep beneath 'This Bed', with only the occasional grand swell or silent ebb to disturb the album's mood. For the large part, however, 'Thistled Spring' sticks to an attractive but limited palette. Ringle's soft, sometimes murmured, lyrics are primarily succinct, poetic sketches of pastoral or domestic scenes, although 'Vernonia Blues' sits itself firmly in folk traditions with its description of the perils of the flood-prone Oregon town. The one thing that always makes Ringle and co's releases a worthwhile prospect is the musicians' ability to create a reflective or almost saddened tone. This record is no exception; in fact it builds upon the un-rushed progression the songwriter has been demonstrating through his back-catalogue. The absence of any clear, stand-out tracks on 'Thistled Spring' marks it down as an album for serious students of contemporary American folk bands, rather than one with much hope or desire to break free of genre or attract casual fans into its stream. Yet this record, like all the band's material, is a slow burner that may not barge through your consciousness, but rather sit back in the corner and gradually unwind. SH"}

They exist between modern rock and 'modern rock gayo,' between indie scene and mainstream, between popularity and commerciality, between possibilities and establishment, between well-made music and well-made-only music, between fresh and deja entendu, between borrowing of the foreign and creatively appropriatiing it, between sharp sensitivity and over-self-indulgence, and finally between boys and girls.\n\nIn other words, they stand at the point where Korean musicians, who are now regarded as \"creative,\" have been through or have stepped back. The difference between Nell and them is that the former has stayed at that point since they debuted. This might be a reason they have brought about extreme reactions, either praises or abhorrences, from fans and critics. All of this happened despite the fact that their music itself is not controversial at all in nature. It is a guitar rock with tidy melodies made by boys that what Nell's music is all about.\n\nBetween here and there, the choice\n\nThus how you judge Nell's fourth album (sixth including ones from their indie era) depends on they make their choice about the betweens. Will they break through, will they step back? They choose neither. They occupy. They cling. They seem to choose to be an \"inbetween.\" Thus they make a \"inbetween\" their identity. Compared to their previous albums, they put a lot of energy in fusing electronic and acoustic music. But they are still making \"non-controversial controversial\" music. It means that this album sounds great, is made with delicate care, and is worth receiving attentions and affections. It sounds afloat a half step above earth. Pretty rock music.\n\nP.S.

{"text":"Latest creation by reclusive master Burial. I don't really have any words for this song, it's self-explanatory. Mellow, deep, caresses yer soul. one of those songs where you realize that analysis and extraneous explanation are unnecessary and you can just sink into the lush embrace of these good vibrations\n\nnormally Thom Yorke's voice gives me the creeps in a bad way, but it works here. The last two minutes\u2026mmh\n\nThis song magnificently combines Burial, Four Tet (who makes stellar remixes), moths, 2-step, and minimalism.

Many other genres have stonewalled or become caricatures of themselves over the past decade, an example being the absurd amount of metal subgenres, which nobody can collectively define to a satisfactory degree and creates a whole lot of ill will.\n\nWhat this music is doing, besides transporting you to a somnambulistic land where forests float in the sky and amiable robots hand you bouquets, is reminding listeners of the ludicrousness of attaching labels and creating categories. We are so eager to pin a label onto a song and then shove it into a drawer, complacent with our success, that we miss out on a significant portion of the listening experience. While it is good to differentiate music to a certain extent, the boundaries between musical genres must be blurred and toyed with, interwoven, even transcended\u2014an admirable feat demonstrated magnificently by both Burial and Four Tet, two of my own electronic darlings.\n\nOr, perhaps I'm overestimating the implications of this music, and should simply enjoy the lovely electronic musings tickling my eardrums.

{"text":"Grey Hairs\n\n14\/11\/2011\n\nEx-Reynolds, ex-Skull Tanker, ex-Harvey Half Devoured and ex-Nervebomb members have turned drunken late-night talk in to reality and have formed a band. Ahead of their first ever gig Paul Klotschkow caught up with them in, where else, the pub.\n\nWhose idea was it for you all to form a band? Chris: I just thought there's a lot of stuff you have to think about when you are making music and you can get too involved in that. You forget that you can just have a target which is to get through two minutes and thirty seconds of a song and it be alright. There's nothing wrong with thinking like that, and it has been ages since I thought in that way.\n\nHow did you all meet? D: Just from going to gigs in Nottingham. C: I've known James and Dave for ages and I met Bod in London really randomly. She was like, \"you should come and see my band.\" I tried to get out of it by saying that I didn't live in London and she told me that she lived in Nottingham. It turned out that she lived one street away from me. I thought that's a good omen to do something. B: I've been doing a few different projects here, but I've been meaning to do something that is just plain fun. Fonda 500 is my main fun thing, but I need something in Nottingham that is fun and simple.\n\nSo are the songs all simple and straightforward? C: I thought they were, but they aren't.\n\nWhat's your longest song? James: The one that we cut from the set, which is currently titled Depressing.\n\nWhy is it called Depressing? J: Probably because it's five minutes long.\n\nWhat does the band sound like? J: I guess it's music from a certain time. C: Actually music stopped after 1994. D: We are trying to found out why. C: It doesn't really have any dynamics. It's just as loud as it can be all of the time.\n\nWhen did you start rehearsing together? B: About three months ago. J: It didn't originally go that easily. Chris had these riffs and they were slightly awkward, because it was noisy hardcore music with strange structures. From doing stuff with Fists previously, our stuff is structured in a way that I understand. Chris' songs are structured in a way that is totally non-understandable to me. So when we initially started rehearsing I was quite nervous... B:...And drank beer... J: Yes and I drank beer. With gentle encouragement I started singing. Then I started shouting, going over the top and putting everything in. We were recording those rehearsals at the time and when we listened back it was just awful. A terrible, terrible thing.\n\nHow did you ask James to be in the band? C: I think I was quite drunk. J: It was after a Part Chimp gig. We were really pissed... B: I'm sensing a theme here. C: We didn't do anything for ages, it was just pub talk. I just wanted to go out a get leathered with people from my own age group.\n\nWhen was the moment when you started to feel like an actual band? C: The thing that made it feel like a band was that I had a riff at home that I could imagine Dave drumming on. As soon as I played it, Dave played the drums exactly as I imagined they would sound like. That was the first song that James came up with vocals for that were fully formed and really good. It's dead easy to play to, every time we play it it is a total breeze, even though it's actually one of the harder songs.\n\nHow does the songwriting work? J: Initially Chris had a demo of 16 songs, we got together and worked out bass and drums and I worked out vocals. Then there were a few newer ones that Chris brought in and then it all came together. C: A lot of other bands that I've been in work on details for quite a long while. With this band though, if you have something new you play it for ten minutes, leave it, then go back to it next time around. There's no real laboured point. We go to the rehearsal room, play the things that we can play quite badly, then James says, \"I'll go and get some cans\" and then it starts to get a little bit better. J: Our rehearsals are 10% thinking about volume, 10% getting psychological about not being able to meet the requirements of the song, 10% drinking, 10% getting Chris to play classic rock riffs, and then 60% going deaf. C: What we are worried about is that we don't really know what 'this' is and we are going to need somebody to tell us what it is. We thought that it would be a good idea to get our friend Andy who makes films to come down to our practice room and just film us, but from a deeply unprofessional standpoint. He gave us the film back and it was pretty illuminating (see video above). I've never done that before, I've always done a demo. I've not been in a band with a bass player for years and what amazed me about that video is that it just sounds like it's got just one big sound, because you forget about the bass player being the bass and you can get on with doing other things. B: Basically he just gives me all of the difficult riffs to play. J: Watching the video was a massive epiphany to Chris because he realised that the whole sound was complete because all he could hear was his guitar before that.\n\nAre you ready to finally present your music to the world at you first gig? J: It swings between 'absolutely' and 'fuck'.\n\n\"You can just make an entire band out minor knee-jerk reactions\"\n\nHow do you think people will react considering the other bands that you play in? C: I reckon in theory it represents something that we all like musically, a common ground. If you were to put together all of the bands that we have been in, you will pick up on the fact that we have shared common interests, but maybe that has never been completely obvious. B: It's just really healthy to have a big range of musical interests and I think that is why we are all in more than one band. D: You can't do all of the things that you want to do in one band.\n\nDo you think the band will change once you start playing shows? C: Yes. As soon as people start calling us \"bollocks\" we will probably stop. J: For me personally, it's the band that I've always wanted to be in. It's like a school boy fantasy band.\n\nIs this a record collection band? C: If your record collection only has five records in it. D: We are going back to our youth and the stuff we listened to when we first started getting in to music, so it's kind of exciting. C: If I'm sitting at home watching Top Gear with my guitar and not thinking, I'm not playing riffs that'd fit my other bands that often. I'm playing stuff that sounds like Nirvana, basically, because that's what I suppose I naturally do. You think that you can't do the things that are really obvious to you. This band feels that it's really obvious to me.\n\nWhat was the first band you were in? J: My first band started in a garage in Corby in about 1992. We went through many name changes in a short while. We were called Morphine for a while until we realised that the band Morphine already existed. All we did was drop the 'i' and replace it with an 'e', so we were M-O-R-P-H-E-N-E. Rather than doing a fusion of hardcore and jazz we did Pantera's Walk. In fact we didn't even do covers of Walk as we couldn't even play that. What we did do was that the hard kids from over the road overheard us rehearsing and started banging on the garage door and hurling abuse at us. We then turned on the ghetto blaster to play Walk and pretended that was us playing. We then changed our name to Jesus Killing Machine. Cemetery spelt with an 'S' was also one of our names. We had a song called Cruel Existence and we had a song about the horrors of animal testing. D: I'm not going to mention all of the crap blues bands I was in as a teenager. The first proper band that I really enjoyed playing in was Skull Tanker. It was in a mates garage. He got pissed up one night and decided to buy a drum kit off Ebay. We moved a few amps in to the garage and made a horrific heavy metal\/punk rock noise. We did really well until we got a complaint and then the Council stopped us from playing. C: Don't say the Council, say \"The Man\". D: Then I made Pissy Leg with the lead singer from Skull Tanker, which was drink as much as possible before going in to a studio and make a horrific noise. J: What are you know as in Grey Hairs? D: I'm known as Pissy Leg because I got my mate to tattoo 'Pissy Leg' on to my leg. B: I would say that my first band was with my sisters when we used to sit in the back of the car. We were a covers band and used to sing to Duran Duran. C: My first band was Reynolds. I didn't started making music until pretty late. I was really into music and would go to gigs, but I didn't realise that I could do it as well. J: What was the first song that Reynolds wrote? C: We were called Fu Manchu, but obviously like Morphene we had to change the name. I don't remember what the first song was called, our drummer wrote it but he didn't stick around for long. We had a song called Being Elvis. The comedian Mark Thomas has this thing about being drunk and becoming Elvis because you die on the toilet. J: That was your first band? Your entire credibility stays intact. You didn't do any funk-metal? C: I just didn't realise that you could. It's hard growing up in the The Fens, nobody plays anything. J: Put that one on the record. Summerlin's sub-culture cool is still intact. John Peel favourites Reynolds was his very first band.\n\nHow many bands do you think that you have all be in between you? C: 10 probably, for me. D: I think it's 12. B: 13 I reckon. C: The great thing when you get a band together, and with this band, is that when you get together and that first moment when you cover a song or something it's really exciting. When you are 18 you are full of the pent-up energy about music, and people are in to that energy, but what you actually turn out is pretty bollocks usually. You get to our age and you are better at doing what you do, but no one is interested in you anymore because you are past the point of being 'cool'. You get better at as you go along, and more to the point, you get angrier. When you are 35 you are angry that you don't know how to get rid of the red button thing on BBC when you are watching sport. Or you know, you get fed up as you don't know how things work in your house like your boiler. I don't think it's pathetic just to concentrate on those minor things. You can just make an entire band out minor knee-jerk reactions to stuff.\n\nIf you are going to sell yourselves to the readers, what would you say you sounded like? J: We kind of sound like solid music. C: Ha, that's the kind of thing Noel Gallagher would say about a new Oasis album. I think that there is a lot of positivity around Nottingham at the moment and we sound like a slightly pathetic shoulder shrug in comparison. I usually don't like going on tour with bands, but I think that this would be great. J: I think that the great thing about us is that just whatever happens will dictate itself. It's just pure expression. B: We are not trying to chase a record deal or prove anything.\n\nDo you feel it's a way of letting off steam away from your other bands? B: And jobs. And Life. J: This is a totally valid and complete thing in it's own right. It's not a side project. I'm really pleased and excited about it. C: Side project makes it sound as if it's a vanity project. J: It's letting off steam as it is bridging the gap between what my other band doesn't do musically. C: For me, what you were doing in Fists made me realise why you would be great in this. You do bridge that gap, but not intentionally maybe.\n\nIs the band a democracy? C: It wasn't to start with, but I don't feel like that anymore. B: You generate ideas and throw loads of stuff at us... J: It's such a new band and the only way to make a band happen in such a quick time is to have someone with loads of songs ready to go. But at the moment we are in that phase where Chris brought in 16 songs and we are focusing on them. At the same time though we are developing more. C: Only four of those original songs though are now in the set. There's one cover and five new ones.\n\nIs there anything that you want to say before we finish? C: You should ask us who our favourite bands are.\n\nNo. Who has the most grey hairs? B: I'm the oldest, but I hide it well.\n\nGrey Hairs play with Uylsess Storm and 8mm Orchestra at Spanky Van Dykes on Friday 18 November 2011.\n\nThey also play with Cantaloupe and Beaty Heart at the Rescue Rooms on Wednesday 23 November 2011."}

They speak eloquently about corporate greed and the plight of the small farmer, the dispossessed, and the environment, and are a particularly poignant reminder that we are living in deeply troubled times.

{"text":"What Are You Listening To?\n\nTrip-hop, hip-hop, and, um... early 2000s pop-punk.\n\nby Jeremy Glass\n\nCharlotte, 25\n\nWhat are you listening to these days?\nOh boy... I listen to a lot of Die Antwoord. I'm kind of obsessed.\n\nAh, those crazy South Africans! What's your favorite song by them?\nI really like \"So What,\" off their new album.\n\nListen: Die Antwoord,\"So What\"\n\nBadass. What else?\nOh! You know what I actually really like? I just started listening to Fruit Bats.\n\nWho is that?\nI have no idea. But there's a video for their song \"You're Too Weird,\" which is my favorite off of their album Tripper. It's awesome. It's kind of campy, kind of retro, but the track is really dope.\n\nWhat's your go-to genre?\nTrip-hop. Massive Attack and Tricky.\n\nWhat's trip-hop, exactly?\nTrip-hop comes from a '90s Bristol music scene and it's kind of like electronic, jazz, and hip-hop. Some of Goldfrapp's stuff is considered trip-hop. There are a lot of bands that sort of halfway fall in to that genre, like Air. Portishead, Massive Attack, and Tricky are all \u2015 in my mind \u2015 the three groups that most closely associated with the genre, but the name trip-hop isn't exactly a favorable label.\n\nListen: Portishead, \"Machine Gun\"\n\nWhat's the most embarrassing thing on your iPod right now?\nMy iPod is full of embarrassing things. Mostly from my gym playlist. I have things like Lady GaGa and Beyonce. Contemporary pop, but I also have things like Aqua and Ace of Base.\n\nBut how good is \"The Sign,\" though?\nThe word \"embarrassing,\" though... I'm really not too embarrassed by those things, but they're things that may not be considered \"cultured\" or \"intelligent.\"\n\nSo, do you act? You're holding a script.\nI do a lot of auditioning, and I just got my first principle role today for a show on SyFy. I heard something about a non-disclosure form, so I don't know if I can tell you, but you need to be watching SyFy all the time just in case I come on it.\n\nAre there aliens or robots? Or robot-aliens?!\nI think there's going to be a floating... something. Nevermind.\n\nThat does sound promising!\nBut you can keep updated on my website, I'm also on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr... every goddamn thing you can think of.\n\nWhat's your theme song, Charlotte Pines?\nI've been trying to listen to a lot of new music lately. I've been making a point of it. Recently, all I listen to is Die Antwoord. That's it. So I guess maybe my theme song would be \"Hey Sexy.\" I listen to that before I go into an audition, so I feel like kind of gangster, on top of my shit. Like, fuck anyone who doesn't appreciate all of this. It's important to have those motivational songs. Especially when you're in a line of work that deals with rejection all the time.\n\nI wouldn't know \u2015 everyone likes me. Okay, pick any awesome song out of the air that you've always loved and hit me with it.\nLet's say Kylie Minogue, \"Two Hearts.\" No, I'm kidding. But that is an awesome song. And Kylie Minogue is like forty and just... the sexiest person. She's like Prince, who never ages a day and remains just... the sex. Can we call it \"Train in Vain?\"\n\nBy The Clash? Hell, yes.\nI feel like that's kind of a pansy Clash song, or so people would lead you to believe. But you can dance to it, and so it's awesome.\n\nCommentarium (14 Comments)\n\nWhat is this \"trip-hop\" of which you speak? Nevermind that it's two decades old now and Tricky\/Massive Attack\/Portishead have been canonized even by notoriously rockist magazines like Rolling Stone. But hey man whatever they make that weirdo artificial computer music stuff. Maybe if they played acoustic guitars or harmonicas they'd be more on your radar."}

{"text":"It's surreal to have your dreams realized, especially when they involve bands you've followed since the beginning. You rooted for them to make it big so they could play in your town, lost your mind the first time you heard their single on the radio, and bought their albums with your babysitting money. This is precisely what happened when I picked up the phone to chat with Jimmy Shaw, guitarist and songwriter of Metric, leading up to their DC and NYC shows this weekend (details on that-at the bottom of the article-ed). After ten years of writing songs in a rapidly changing world, Metric still manage to turn out tracks that are painfully personal, often scandalous and always chic. We find something very different, however, in their latest record Synthetica, which captures the artificial atmosphere surrounding big questions about the disconcerting state of the world. Thankfully, Jimmy has a lot to say on the matter.\n\nHow was the international leg of the tour?\n\nWe started out the album cycle touring strange parts of the world, like Australia and Singapore. Turkey as well. We went to those places before we did any North American stuff. It's been kind of trippy. You're in a country at the other end around the world and be playing a song you wrote in your bedroom and there are thousands of people dancing to it. You remember where it came from, and why it existed. It's a very surreal experience.\n\nYou wrote it in your bedroom, and I dance to it in my bedroom. I dance to \"Stadium Love\" in the morning when I need energy.\n\nThat's kinda the point, right? We always talked about what the point of this band was. The way you just described it\u2013 that's it. The band is kind of like a kickstarter; a motivator. The point of everything we've tried to do is to get people to let go and say, \"You know what? Fuck it, I do want to do that. I gotta find some energy and get out of the house. I have to get off the couch. I gotta stop being depressed.\" It's a call to action.\n\nWell, it's working. And usually the action is dance. So I was really surprised to see that the DC show was a seated one. Was that an intentional move, to create a different kind of experience?\n\nI think you'll find that you're going to be dancing most of the time anyways, just in and around the seats as opposed to a big concrete floor. We've played many many many soft theaters in our time, and people don't sit down. I wouldn't be worried about that. The weird thing is, it's never going to be, or really rarely going to be, a venue that's completely in line with what you envisioned. The venue has existed way before you were there and way before you wrote the song. The first go around is the shitty bar venues with crappy stages that have five bands a night, seven nights a week. And you start working your way up to theaters, and the clubs get a little bit better but it's still not great. You slowly move up and up, but there's no such thing as a 2500 seat venue that's not like a theater. When you're at this level it's all theaters, and the next level is all arenas, which also has a level of weirdness to it. The whole thing is kind of weird. You're sort of subject to what's available. You just need to roll in to those venues and play the music you wrote and hope that people get the idea right.\n\nSo what would Metric's dream venue be, as designed by you?\n\nOh my god, that's such a good question and I have no idea. I think it would look like a beautiful old ornate weird amphitheater on a ranch in Northern California with a lake. With a bunch of hippies rolling around.\n\nI would totally be there. Emily's vocals aside, I feel like the lyrics tell a very feminine story, and that the band has been the maturing of this girl; that Metric could be a girl you'd meet at a party. What would that girl be like?\n\nShe'd be a lot like Emily. I have run into that girl at parties, and her name is Emily. And she's awesome to party with. Someone said to me when we finished Fantasies, that all of Emily's commentary and her opinions and her take on the world, and her gripes about it and issues with it that she's sang for years and years and years\u2013 when we made the record Fantasies \u2013 it was balanced with just enough sugar to help the medicine go down. And the person telling me this said that they found it a bit rough. If this was a girl you met at a party telling me her opinions ten minutes in, I'd be really irritated and not want to have that conversation anymore, because I'm at a fucking party so leave me alone. But when she's doing it, by the time she got to that record, she knew how to mix it in with just enough sweetness, that you wanted to hear the issues and her point. And you were okay with understanding where she was coming from. And all of a sudden you're thinking, \"Wow, this girl is fucking rad. I want to hang out with her for five hours.\"\n\nIt's such a striking balance of lyrics and attitude. The delivery is so important here.\n\nTotally. We had a really crazy vibe last night while we had a night off in Wisconson, in this lot that was slanted. Like, roll out of your bunk slanted. And we were parked there for the whole day with nothing to do, just a straight up day off. But we all sat in the bus last night, had a number of drinks, and listened to all of our old records. Seriously, I listened to Live It Out and Old World Underground for the first time in seven years. I hadn't listened to those in forever. Forever! Listening to all these songs, and it was such a trip to hear the whole thing and where we've been coming from for ten years. I just think about now most of the time. I don't think about the scale of the whole thing. And people listen to this album and go back to that album, probably have favorites from all over, and it's really interesting for me to understand the scope of our music for ten years. And it's funny that we bring that up about Emily, because she certainly was angular back then. Some of her lyrics are fucking hilarious. I think, \"I can't believe she said that.\"\n\nThere are a lot of songs spread out on different albums that I'd listen to in similar moments. If I'm down, I'll listen to \"Stadium Love\" or \"Live It Out.\" They've very exhilarating tracks, and I love that you can make the listener feel the same way through different points in the story of Metric. Somehow you still achieve that same feeling.\n\nThat's been the point of making music with Emily. She'll come in with these incredibly sad songs, and I'll speed them up by something like 40 bpm and throw a beat behind it, and try and make it full of energy. Depression is real. Sadness is a totally key element in life and you can't avoid it. At the same time, it's really easy to be sad. It's really difficult to be happy, and that's a daily thing that you need to decide. And taking those lyrics and taking her intentions and taking her frustration and infusing it with an energy that makes you want to make your life positive\u2013 I feel that's a really important thing to have done.\n\nI can definitely hear that in Fantasies and Live it Out, but I hear something completely different on Synthetica. I know the London riots broke out during recording and derailed the process, and I'm sure it was a big lyrical influence, especially in \"Youth Without Youth.\"\n\nYeah, for sure. I think a lot of stuff influenced that record. That record was more us looking at the word and trying to express what we see and think, maybe more than in any other record. The others have been \"this is what I'm doing,\" and they were very personal. There's very little that's personal about Synthetica. It's really about looking from a real state of confusion. We really don't have any answers on that record at all, but there's a lot of fucking questions. We're definitely not shying away from asking some of those questions and asking, why are things the way they are right now? Is it better? Is it okay? Is it a good thing that things are this way? Is it confusing? Reassuring? I don't know. We live in a totally bizarre exponential time right now where things are moving insanely fast. We had a conversation about that last night. Everyone talks about five, ten, twenty, even thirty years from now. But I've never heard someone say more than thirty years in a long time. We can't even fucking remotely imagine what the world is going to be like in thirty years, let alone a hundred. Everything we know in history happened in the last hundred years. Everything! It's fucking crazy, and we're moving at a rate that's literally thousands of times faster than a hundred years ago. What the fuck is going to happen in the next hundred years?\n\nI've heard a lot from friends about how they can't really connect to Synthetica, but I think it might be discomfort as a result of all the questions.\n\nI'm finding that right now, people are really avoiding asking any questions, which I find very strange. At the moment, I find myself concerned. I'm not shaking my head at it; I'm not saying that we're necessarily going in the wrong direction, there are just a lot of questions. The common theme right now in everything else is \"Don't think about it at all, just party on and don't worry, everything is going to be just fine.\" It so could easily not be fine. That's just the wheel. Music seems weird to me right now. I find that the whole thing is incredibly shallow.\n\nWe can't seem to have any ballads without a danceable radio edit that ruins it.\n\nYeah, exactly. Most radio songs right now\u2013 let me guess, it's about a breakup. Nothing against those songs, really. But with everything we're talking about, you're either in the club, or you're breaking up. And that's about it. Are there any other themes going on? There seem to be just three. And trust, me I go to clubs and I fucking party.\n\nSo what are your \"THAT'S MY JAM\" songs in the club?\n\nI don't know. I don't really know what it is, I just know what it is when I like it.\n\nYou're not losing your mind over the newest Kanye album?\n\nKanye is fucking amazing. Kanye is the best and I love him. He's an amazing caricature of himself and he has no problem with it. There's something about his honesty that I really respect. He's not trying to be anyone other than who he really is, and he doesn't give a fuck what anyone else thinks.\n\nI was going to ask about people you'd collaborate with, but I think we've got that one covered.\n\nDefinitely, and I feel like the whole wave of electronic music that's happening right now is really amazing. I'm continuously getting more and more into that style of production. When I listen to pop records, I don't really know who these people are for the most part, it seems to be the same ten of them on the same record or some shit. There's something about modern production that's really fascinating. I'm really curious as to what would happen if we took a lot of modern style production that has one lyric about bootys in the club over top of a beat for 25 minutes, but you actually said something over top of it\u2013 what would that be like? I mean really beautiful, impactful lyrics and melody over top a very modern style dance production. I really wonder what that would sound like?\n\nAlright, last question: Did you sacrifice any important parts of your creative process to achieve the artificial atmosphere of Synthetica? Did you sacrifice anything you normally include in an album?\n\nNo. I feel like things weigh in on the other side. I've sacrificed sleep and comfort, I've sacrificed money and I've sacrificed levels of success because I never wanted to sacrifice a single note of the music. That's not a complaint. It is what it is. Especially with Synthetica, I've made pretty much exactly the record that I wanted to make without second guessing it at any step along the way. And it didn't matter to me if there were any singles on the record, or if it was more catchy or less catchy or more hooky or less poppy or more rock. I didn't really give a fuck. I just went into the studio and followed my inspiration. When I look back at it now, I'm really proud of it and I think it's some of the best work I've ever done. It's definitely making a decision, and that decision is definitely going to keep the band or sway the band into a specific place in the world. And what people think about us, the level of success that we have, the kind of rooms that we play, the kind of radio play that we get\u2013 there are bigger things to look at, and it's weighty. We decided to take some stuff on. Not everyone in the world feels like doing that right now.\n\nI really wanted to like the new album, I knew that Fantasies would be tough to top. I have given it multiple spins at multiple times and I'm still coming with \"eh\". they all sound the same after a while, there's no hook. Fantasies had hooks galore, each song stood out on its own, but they weren't obnoxious. this album seems to be playing it safe or something"}

{"text":"It's not exactly a unique take to point out the cognitive dissonance between the sunny surf rock layers of Album and its melancholy subject matter, but it's such a defining aspect of the album that you can't ignore it.It's an album of disillusioned late summer, when tans turn leathery, when flings turn into breakups, when warmth becomes suffocating heat.If you can take Christopher Owens' Elvis-Costello-after-a-night-of-speedballs vocals and you have half the appreciation for surf music that I do, then you'll find Album as lovely and moving as I have.\n\n\u2014All Mod Cons by The Jam\n\nElvis Costello meets The Who\n\nThe Jam is apparently massively successful in its native England, but that fame never translated across the Atlantic.

One redeeming quality of the album is the combination of the male and female vocal leads, however The Darlings' use of this style seems to split the difference between the alluring minimalism of the Moldy Peaches and the infectious energy of Los Campesinos, giving it an almost dull tone at times.\n\nMy final grievance I feel I must air is their excessive-bordering-on-obsessive use of the sing-songy \"ooh, ooh, ooh\" interlude, as if they couldn't write enough verses for a 15-minute EP, but I want to emphasize that these criticisms are not meant as a condemnation of this EP. While I will not use the words innovative, groundbreaking, or visionary to describe The Darlings at this stage in their careers, Warma is most definitely a light, fun, toe-tapping piece that certainly deserves a spot at any party and on any long car ride."}

{"text":"RIFF MARKET\n\n18 May 2006\n\nI SLIP ON IT EVERY TIME\n\nI'm sure the Perceptionists or 7L or the Blanks or whoever had at least eight or nine concept records in them about the Big Dig, Boston's euphemism for the blackhole of dirt and money rackets that eventually rerouted Interstate 93 underneath the downtown. It is, says wiki, \"the single most expensive highway project in American history.\" Good for you, Boston. But I wonder about the Indians who helped you dump all that tea in the harbor, what they'd have to say.\n\nWhile surely some sweet undergraduate or feathers-not-dots type is writing five theses on the Big Dig's psychological effects on Boston pop, I'd just like to note that DC's the Walkmen have written what could be the New York Yankees of fly-by Boston sucks rock tunes--their own \"big\" \"dig.\" If \"a 100,000 blinking lights are making me exhausted\" isn't about that miserable stretch of Big Dig shitdirt near the top of Hanover in Little Italy, the one with the accordian player hobo I used to give money to my way in off the T, then on the way back I'd wave to him and he'd say something like \"I don't want your wave, I want your money!\", I don't know what it is--maybe something about the Scientology building? Don't get me started on the bums over there.\n\nBut the psychological effects. What the weather and blue laws and curse of Babe didn't already do to the place... I mean beyond nothing downtown open after 2am (or 11:30pm if you didn't have a car or the cash for the city's notoriously pricey cabbies--sidenote, if you ask me, that's why Brian's \"I'll pay for your taxicab... if you suck etc etc\" seemed so reasonable at first), there was the navigation difficulty. That line \"we're clearing our stuff and we're packing the car and heading on uptown...\" is ten retards brilliant because Leithauser delivers it so cheery, so optimistic--maybe uptown's awesome. Then comes the disappointment: \"...and nothing's gone on.... you can hear a shout for miles around.\"\n\nThat said, this song could have been better if it was about being lost in Boston.\n\n17 May 2006\n\nTHE NATION\n\nInspired by Tom Morello and others complaining to MTVnews that music isn't as political as it should be given the unrest, here are a few things rockstars can write on their guitars to get the message out. If everybody writes at least one of the following slogans on his guitar, we might be able to show the government how much we distrust them. Here are the slogans:\n\n16 May 2006\n\nROCK SHOCK\n\nSorry to break from my positivity streak but goddamn this new Kitsune comp--what the shit? I read something like this piece and really want to believe \"Maison 2 seems poised to take the ruins left in the wake of Daft Punk and pulverize whatever chunks were inadvertently left behind,\" which the author says is a good thing. But please please please tell me the future of 1997 isn't MSTRKRFT79 remixing Wolfmother or yet another terrible remix of \"Banquet\" that's so bad I think I might actually like the original now. Haven't we learned our lesson?\n\nPrevious riffs have come to the defense of indierock dance parties--not because people were dancing to rock music, and in fact especially not that. We all have been to a Barenaked Ladies show and know exactly what high school girls will do if they had a million dollars. Thing was, you get the right indierockdance DJ and she can move you pretty much effortlessly from rock to actual house to actual disco and maybe you find out you \"don't need six strings to get down\" (actual quote). I say \"actual\" merely to mean house qua house, not some sort of housified rock or discofied rock, because the best of these parties were working frontline to dismantle rock-as-normative music, and I thought that project had merit.\n\nFitting then that the first time I heard a Kitsune Maison 2 track was at one of Erol Alkan's NYC gigs last week. Alkan didn't spin it; I think it might have been before-Alkan DJ Dave P who pulled out Digitalism's \"Jupiter Room (Martian Assault Edit)\" which plays (gloriously) like a Homework track with the mids alternately clipped or blown out. It's one of the best tracks Kitsune's ever put out, and definitely a top10er 2006 for me so far. The rest of Alkan's night though was predominantly that really forced, rest of KM2 sound--hookless rock put on the rack of a steady fourbeat, a bunch of records wearing stick-on moustaches and thinking that we won't know the difference or worse--that dancified rock is all we really wanted in the first place. It's not philosophical opposition to one-pass \"make me something I'm not\" rock remixes--but maybe that's exactly what it is. Mostly I feel icky listening to the bad ones, and pretty bored, and confused as to what the motivations are for, say, Wolfmother to want a clubgoing audience when I've seen the tail that guy pulls without.\n\n15 May 2006\n\nCHA CHA CHA\n\nWherein the snake-, titties-, fart-, and now poop-obsessed Riff Market becomes self-parodic. Granted \"I.B.S.\" doesn't have many snakes or titties in it, but it has lots of small intestines, which are a something of a snake\/titty hybrid. Take this from somebody who thought \"Popozao\" was single of the year: \"I.B.S.\" is single of the year.\n\nThis is personal. I've been following the I.B.S. game for a while now. My dad was in permanent asshole mode my first sixteen because he had a particularly badass form of I.B.S. called Crohn's Disease. No offense to Cam'Ron's son but if \"I.B.S.\" is \"a true story right here\" well then my dad's intestines are way more fucked up than his dad's. The way Crohn's works, something (nobody knows what for sure) tricks the immune system into rehabbing a patch of digestive tissue, in my dad's case the small intestines. The repairs don't stop is the thing, so what is usually the SI's quarter-size diameter fissures into a small, almost impassable hole the size of a bed bug. Food gets stuck there and hurts like a mother, and that's when my dad would yell at my sisters to turn on Martin just so he could scream \"what did I tell you?! NO MARTIN AT DINNER\" or punch a hole through his fishtank or whatever. You don't know what sadness is until you've seen a discus fish flapping on your kitchen floor and heard your mom say to flush it down the toilet--\"before it's too late.\"\n\nEventually dad got A+R work--Anastomosis and Resection--which is when a doc cuts out the diseased tissue and sews the good guts back together, and he's since moved on from freshwater to saltwater tanks. But goddamn could Cam's opener \"ulcers hurt my salary, alter my personality\" been the away message of his lifetime. Exactly how people with a real case of the shits think about the condition--it's so bad it affects your salary. \"Ripping off my undershirts\" was also something dad did, but I think that was less stomach-related, more a \"I'm gonna do the Hulk Hogan thing in front of my entire family\" thing.\n\nThe hustler\/stay on your hustle\/can't stay on my hustle when I gotta poop stuff rings true too. When not playing drums in Philly's hottest bar mitzvah bands, my dad drives one of those lunch trucks that go to construction sites and bring food\/happiness\/bowel trouble to all the workers. It's pretty much exactly like dealing drugs or prostituting women--so much so that my friend Danny has been known to refer to his favorite prostitutes as \"sex lunch trucks.\"\n\nHey drug users: Do you shit a lot? I'm wondering why Cam so anxiously asserts \"true story\" as much as he says \"please don't relate me to drugs,\" and why of all the tracks on the new album, this song, about shitting and throwing up, is the true story. The condition totally runs you, dictates what you can and can't do and most times that means needing a bathroom within a few yards of you at all times. But unless Cam's actually eating gourmet quaalude burgers or whatever I don't know why he thinks people think he has I.B.S. over drug use. That or my dad has a lot of explaining to do."}

{"text":"Mike Shiflet's \"Bedside\" comes on like a score to a black-and-white silent movie about European travel during the 1940s, its m\u00e9lange of piano preponderance, ringing static, atmospheric found samples\u2014trains, machinery\u2014and the buzz of electronic micro-effects implying stamped passports and dated photographs curling at their edges, doomed love affairs lost to the fog of distance and memory, squalor and dim sadness. One pictures stick figures jerking to and fro before a camera's lens, hurtling away from unknowable wheres and towards unimaginable tos; lint-coated photograph needles dropped onto records revolving; indistinct plague dreams where everyone dons a bowler or a poor-boy hat but no one has a face.\n\nShiflet is a noise lifer who is no stranger to texturally-inclusive compositions, but despite its innate malevolence\u2014a swarming churn underwrites the warmth here, its pitch-shifts cleverly obfuscated most of the time\u2014\"Bedside\" strikes me as the most nuanced, involving piece he's ever had a hand in. As the denouement approaches, Shiflet's anachronistic fa\u00e7ade crumbles away, leaving something more translucent and less certain in its wake; the listener is left questioning the wholesale emotional resonance of what came before. Did that really just happen? Was it a dream? Am I truly living an idyll, or is that idyll a psychological device to mask the horror or emptiness of the present moment?\n\nThe Pete Swanson we meet when \"College View\" erupts into being, a rampaging posse of electro-pop algorithms tripping over their own feet to storm the castle, rattling phosphorescent sabers and iridescent uranium chains, will be familiar to those who enjoyed last year's tubular, convulsive, Man With Potential, which itself was reminiscent of the best of Swanson's work as half of Yellow Swans: think Bring The Neon War Home, think Live During War Crimes #2. The idea that noise-rock should always sound like a Chinese fireworks factory being torched for insurance money while being filmed in gorgeous 4D remains an alluring one, and one that the first five minutes of \"College View\" pay intense, rapturous homage to. Then Swanson's party burns itself out, and we're left with three elements to concentrate on: a slow-clap coliseum avalanche, a three-chord keyboard vamp, and a nauseating burst of effects glitter. As the dynamics shift into a realm of greater fluidity, mutilated horns muscle in during minute seven; the sounds of paper tearing itself apart materialize in minute nine. Entropy reigns, however merrily, looping lopsidedly into a damning silence\u2014the perfect precursor, ultimately, to a rain-slicked downer like \"Bedside.\""}
{"text":"Bob Dylan's latest album \"Tempest\" may not be Shakespeare, but it's still a work of art.\n\n\"They're peddlers and they're meddlers\/They buy and they sell\/They destroyed your city\/They'll destroy you as well,\" Dylan croons on his most recent album. \"Tempest\" is on of Dylan's darker, more stormy albums. Photo courtesy Billboard.com.\n\nDylan's 35th studio album, released Sept. 11, poetically cements what listeners knew all along: Dylan's ability to tell a story. His raspy, grizzled voice \u2013 though by no means not melodious \u2013 complements the album nicely and leaves listeners with an eerie sense that they're crowded around a campfire, sharing old stories.\n\nLyrically, it's one of Dylan's darkest albums. In just 10 songs, Dylan sings about a murder-suicide, John Lennon's assassination and the sinking of the Titanic.\n\n\"Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing\/ Blowing like it's gonna kill me dead,\" he sings.\nThe album opens with the jaunty \"Duquesne Whistle.\" Its upbeat rhythm juxtaposes with Dylan's gloomy lyrics, leaving listeners oddly satisfied and excited for the rest of the album.\n\nWith each track Dylan's voice gets raspier and the songs get darker. Songs like \"Pay In Blood\" where Dylan declares \"I paid in blood\/ But not my own,\" are sure to become iconic Dylan songs, joining the likes of \"Tangled Up In Blue\" and \"Ballad of a Thin Man.\"\n\nDylan, known for criticizing the elite, stays true to that reputation in \"Early Roman Kings.\"\n\"They're peddlers and they're meddlers\/They buy and they sell\/They destroyed your city\/They'll destroy you as well,\" Dylan croons.\n\nAlthough the whole album is outstanding, the two best songs, \"Tempest\" and \"Roll on, John,\" are Dylan's darkest. With 43 verses and no chorus, \"Tempest\" is more of a story than a song. His 14-minute epic about the sinking of Titanic captures listeners' attention in a way only Dylan can.\n\nIn \"Roll on, John\", Dylan's haunting lyrics describe the shooting of John Lennon, his close friend. With its incorporation of Beatles lyrics, the song is beautiful, poignant and sure to be an instant classic.\n\nWith a quality album like \"Tempest,\" the only tragedy more sad than Dylan's lyrics is missing out on this masterpiece."}

Especially happiness. The music ebbs and flows as the tides from sensation to sensation, much like the ever so brief life we're given. However, Abstraction always pivots on happiness. Each song drives itself to a better place, a warmer place. In that sense, as much as music tends to be a source for reflection to draw from the past, Abstraction is fundamentally rooted in the future. It's written as a reminder. It's so easy to see the dark, the dreary and the desolate in the world. I want to remind you to find the beauty in all things; find beauty in nature, free-thought, humankind and above all yourself."}

{"text":"Party like it's 1999: The Music Tapes\n\nThe Music Tapes ' the idiosyncratic project of Julian Koster, probably best known as the musical jack of all trades in Jeff Mangum's legendary Neutral Milk Hotel ' will be in town tonight at the First Unitarian Church. Our own K. Ross Hoffman gives you the skinny in this week's music section:\n\nMusic Tapes for Clouds and Tornadoes is a particularly creaky incarnation of the E6 aesthetic, what with Koster's warbly blurt of a voice, fetish for antiquarian recording devices and reliance on novelty-factor instruments like banjos, toy organs and his beloved singing saw (not to mention whimsical creations like the 7-foot-tall metronome), but its fragile, folksy charms shine through the cutesy gimmickry.\n\nI'll be going to the show tonight. I first saw Koster and the Music Tapes back in 1999 when they opened for the Olivia Tremor Control at Penn's Pi Lam. Their set was notable more for, IIRC, the giagantic papier mache hands-clapping machine than for the music (and for the fact that since it was at Pi Lam, the show ran like two hours behind). But it was an experience I'll not soon forget (as evidenced by the fact that I remember it vividly 10 years later).\n\nThe year prior, on the eve of Neutral Milk Hotel's performance at The Pontiac, I interviewed Koster about the finer points of playing a saw. That show stands as the single greatest concert I've ever seen.' Read the full interview after the jump:\n\nHow does one start playing the singing saw?\n\nWhen I was little I saw an old guy in Central Park playing it. It was the most amusing thing I ever saw. It took me a while to figure out that you have to find a saw that wants to sing. I think mostly you have to learn how to pet the saw in just the right way and get it to where it's comfortable singing and then you just let it go. Once it's caught up in the vibration it sings its heart out. And be considerate. Most saws can sing- they're like people, some are gifted and some don't need tobe coerced and some do, but any saw can sing.\n\nIs it possible for a saw to be out of tune?\n\nOh sure. It's sometimes very difficult for a saw to be in tune. It's usually the sort of thing where the relationship between the saw and the person is fresh. It's kinda like that sound with young kids playing in the orchestra. It can be a lot like that.\n\nAre there different pitched saws, like a tenor saw, an alto saw and a bass saw?\n\nOh sure, definitely. The smaller ones sing higher. I have this picture of these women in the '40s playing these really big saws.\n\nDo you have a favorite brand or kind of saw?\n\nNo, I try not to discriminate. I've yet to meet a bad saw. There's one that was here when we moved in. He sings pretty low. Every one's different' where it came from and its lineage and how it was treated. There's abuse in a lot of cases. Being experienced and confident has a lot to do with being able to generate a certain vibration, and once it's happened [it's important] to not prohibit it.\n\nSo you're playing it as much as you're letting it play?\n\nIn a sense. You have a lot of responsibility in guiding and reassuring it. In some respects they're shy.\n\nCan you reveal any trade secrets?\n\nThere's really specific things that you couldn't impart with words. Patience is really important. And I think that if it hurts, keep trying different ways. The way I learned I got myself hurt a lot. It shouldn't kill your fingers. It's not hard to show someone, but it's kind of hard to describe.\n\nHow is it that you guys can work all these odd instruments into songs without going nuts trying to arrange things?\n\nIn some respects what Neutral Milk Hotel is is Jeff's little world and we all have our own little worlds and we all care about each others' little worlds. I think that's the coolest thing about the time and space we share together. There's always someone who loves your ideas and is willing to add their own ideas. Sometimes your ideas have such a strange one-dimensional feel to them. It makes it more real and human to be able to open up to your friends and let them breathe life into them. Jeff has dreams and visions and says, \"Hey, just come and screw it up so it's not just a pile of me.\"\n\nThe liner notes say that you also play an instrumentcalled the wandering genie. What's that?\n\nI think that's best kept a secret for now.\n\nMichelle\n\nPosted 2009-03-04 19:05:09\n\nTo learn about how to play the saw, brands of saws that play well, history of the instrument, and get all your singing saw questions answered: there is a Musical Saw Festival every July in NYC - \nLast year 30 saw players attended.

{"text":"The Crescent - Spinnin' Wheels (Hut\/Virgin)\n\nThis latest release from The Crescent is one of a sort of record that just begs the question: why? It's really a nondescript\njangly piece of indie pop that serves no purpose whatsoever.\n\nThe singer's\ngrating voice rasps over a leaden, workmanlike track. It could pass\nfor the b-side of some second rate Stone Roses cover band, but it all\njust seems like to so much effort to go through, to release something so\nunforgettable.\n\nPerhaps that is their greatest trick. Literally within seconds of the\nsong ending, I was forced to replay the damn thing, as apart from some vague\nmemory of an unpleasant guitar, the song had gone straight in one ear and\nout the other, a quality that I can only say on a repeat listen I was\nentirely grateful for. Not so much a case of must do better, as must do\nsomething."}
{"text":"Review: High praise for the White Noisemaker\n\n\"Under the White Noise\" by Scott Sapp is to be taken much more seriously than the notebook-paper CD case it is sold in. It is a thoughtful album that fulfills the complex vision of its creator and exceeds any fathomable expectations of its listeners.\n\n\"White Noise\" is a diverse album that finds inspiration from a host of artists, including Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix. Its quality lies in Sapp's acoustic tracks. The experimentation on display throughout the album is admirable, although this sense of daring sometimes compromises the quality of Sapp's better songs.\n\nThe first two tracks, \"Somebody Should Have Known\" and \"The Dream Less Dreamt,\" are the quintessential Scott Sapp. Both songs effectively convey the message and the emotion that the artist intended through ghostly lyrics and gentle acoustic guitar. These songs are thoughtful in an absent-minded sort of way.\n\nThe fifth track, \"Antinomianism,\" is constructive experimentation that effectively breaks from the flow of the album while still adding to the overall quality.\n\nBut sometimes the experimentation doesn't quite work. For example, \"Back in Time\" at its heart might be the album's best song, but the cacophonous intro played by a recorder obscures the rest of the track.\n\nSapp has substance in each one of his songs, but he needs to stick to the unadulterated acoustic sound that makes the core of his album so impressive. The album would benefit from better technical production, but nonetheless it is a triumph given the resources he had available.\n\n\"Under the White Noise\" is not available on LimeWire, but for a modest price of $3 you can pick up a copy from Scott's locker."}

{"text":"Homogenic is some really sick\nshit, I tell ya. By sick, I mean this music sounds like it's dying,\nbut in a beautiful way, like if the image of rapidly generating\ncancerous cells could be magnified to create an awesome psychedelic\nlight show.\n\nNo, this isn't\na euphoric but cynical party album that will set the dance floors\nablaze much like Debut did four years ago.\nNor does it contain the eclecticism of Post, with its day-glo splashes, subtle hues\nand drab earth tones mixing in one schizophrenic package. If you\nare looking for a reference point, Homogenic is similar to her darker and more challenging\nTelegram remix album that\ncame out last year.\n\nIf this is\na \"commercial\" or \"pop\" album, I don't know\nwhat the hell those terms represent anymore unless you redefine\nthem to mean dissonant yet melodic, complex and minimalist and staccato\nwhile still maintaining rhythm. The album gets off to a menacing\nstart with \"Hunter,\" whose instrumentation and overall\ntone define Homogenic. The lyrics aren't\nnecessarily scary or foreboding (\"thought I could organize\nfreedom, how Scandinavian of me\"), but the pulsing drum machine\nsnares and the dramatic string arrangement courtesy of Deodato evoke\na feeling of dread.\n\n\"Hunter\"\nalso serves as a preliminary warning that this ain't no dance record,\nnor is it a chill out record. In fact, I have no convenient labels\nthat address the music's function, unless you want to call it \"dishwashing\nin hell music.\" If \"Joga\" (the album's first single)\nis a sure-shot hit record, then I have a great two-part 12\"\ndisco single called Metal\nMachine Music\nI want to sell you. Nevertheless, in today's confused and contradictory\npop- music marketplace nothing surprises me anymore. If you had\ntold me 10 years ago that Steve Albini would produce Robert Plant\nand Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones would make a record with Diamanda\nGalas, I would have laughed you out of the universe.\n\nNow, I'd probably\nbarely bat an eye if I heard that John Bonham, Keith Moon and Dennis\nWilson were resurrected so they could put out a new age percussion\nalbum with Pete Best, as well as members of ABBA and Napalm Death.\n\nThere is a\nlot of ugliness and beauty in the world that Bjork wants to capture\nand bottle in her odd little ditties. \"Bachelorette,\"\nfor instance, is a quirky love song with a pretty string-laden melody\nand lyrics that only Bjork could write and sing with genuine urgency.\nIt begins with the lines, \"I'm a fountain of blood in the shape\nof a girl. You're a bird on the brim hypnotized by the whirl. Drink\nme, make me real, wet your beak in the stream. The game we're playing\nis life; love is a two-way dream.\"\n\nLove is a\nconstant theme that flows throughout the album, and the song \"5\nYears\" is no exception. Over a rhythmic pulse that sounds like\na Geiger counter gettin' off to the sounds of Nena's \"99 Red\nBalloons\" in the wake of a nuclear apocalypse, Bjork sings,\n\"I dare you to take me on. I dare you to show me your palms.\nI'm so bored of cowards who say what they want\/ Then they can't\nhandle, can't handle love.\" No Bjork, they might be able to\nhandle love, but they just can't handle you... you freaky Icelandic\nchanteuse!\n\nI usually\ndon't pay any attention to lyrics (which, by the way, drives my\nfiancee nuts). Whether the artists are like Yoko Ono and Elizabeth\nFraser (in which vocal texture is more important than verbal text),\nor they are akin to Frank Sinatra or Chuck D (in which the opposite\nis true), I just couldn't give two shits about what they are saying\nmost of the time. I just treat vocals like any other instrument\nwhen I am evaluating a particular piece of music. For instance,\na White middle-aged pseudo-soul man howl is just as annoying to\nme as a cheesy-ass, mid-1980s Miami Sound Machine wannabe synth\nhorn line. The singer could be giving me step-by-step instructions\non how to successfully win the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes\nand I'd still end up changing the channel.\n\nBut, as you've\nprobably noticed by the frequency in which I've quoted her, I can't\nhelp but obsess over some of Bjork's song- poems, primarily because\nthey are so damn peculiar. For instance, these are the complete\nlyrics to \"Unravel\": \"While you are away my heart\ncomes undone ... slowly unravels in a ball of yarn. The devil collects\nit with a grin ... our love a ball of yarn. He'll never return it.\nSo when you come back we'll have to make new love.\"\n\nSure, I've\nheard plenty of weird 'n' wacky couplets by professional acid casualties\nsuch as Robyn Hitchcock, but the way Bjork delivers her verses is\ncompletely without pretension and artifice.\n\nI have to\nsay that this album lives up to the promise that Bjork made to me\nwhen I first heard The Sugarcubes' \"Birthday.\" That bleak\nsingle with an odd time-signature, a wobbly bass line, a warbling\ntreated trumpet and lyrics about child molestation sent me running\nto the record store the second I heard it. I was disappointed that\nthe rest of Life's\nToo Good\nwasn't like \"Birthday,\" but fortunately I could hear her\ntelling me, \"Don't worry Kembrew. One day I'll make an album\nthat completely fulfills all of your neurotic fantasies.\""}

{"text":"'TALK' DRIVES COLDPLAY CRAZY!\n\nCOLDPLAY have left it to the last minute to decide the final tracklisting of 'X&Y' - with the band unable to decide whether to include the song 'TALK' after struggling with its recording for months.\n\nThe song was one of the tracks NME.COM heard last year while the band were in a London studio working on 'X&Y', released on June 6. The version NME.COM heard borrowed the riff from [a][\/a]'s 'Computer Love', building to a completely new song.\n\nHowever, during the difficult recording sessions which have seen the band scrap huge amounts of material, the song was one of the ones that caused most difficulty \u2013 to the point that it was completely left of early versions of the record sent out to their British label. At one point it was being talked about as a potential comeback single.\nNME.COM understands that now the group have found a mix they're happy with, but have been unable to decide what to do with it.\n\nChris Martin told NME.COM: \"From that version (NME.COM heard) we went and did a whole other version of it. A whole other song. What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and then someone said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. I hate choosing singles, it's so hard. We've just mixed it and it sounds great. I think we've had such pain getting to that place, I'm not sure anyone quite knows what to do with it anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega.\"\n\nChris also told NME.COM that the title of the album is inspired by the extreme nature of his day-to-day life. He continued: \"It's a cooler way of saying ying and yang. If I'd called it ying and yang we'd have been in trouble! 10% would walk away. But another 20% would come. We'd be a lot bigger in the Far East. My whole day is a mixture of optimism and pessimism in its most extreme forms. And that's what 'X&Y' is to me. It's two sides. I like the fact they're very strong letters, very clear. Very hard lines, it looks great when you write it down. And it looks great when you see the artwork. It's fucking amazing. I can say that because I didn't do it.\"\n\nColdplay's next show is when they headline California's Coachella Festival. From there, they return to the UK in June for an expected Glastonbury headline slot on June 25, followed by a massive arena tour."}
{"text":"Charlotte Gainsbourg: Stage Whisper\n\nIf there's a group more likely to make terrible records than the offspring of rock stars, it's actors. Charlotte Gainsbourg just so happens to fall into both categories. She's the daughter of (in)famous French songwriter-actor-director Serge Gainsbourg and British actress-singer Jane Birkin, and an accomplished actress on her own right (starring in The Science of Sleep, the Dylan-biopic I'm Not There and, more recently, Lars Von Trier's Melancholia). She also proves herself an exception to the rule by being a damn fine musician, a fact she further proves on her fourth full-length release. Cobbled together from studio leftovers from 2009's Beck-produced IRM and live material captured during that album's subsequent tour, Stage Whisper can have an unsubstantial feel despite its bulky two-disc format. The sparse, simple electro-pop tunes with unassuming melodies grow on you but don't quite reward the patience they require. The live disc is the real attraction, packing the energy and immediacy missing from the studio material. Though Stage Whisper likely won't make any of the 3,000 year-end \"best of\" lists, it's a fine, occasionally very interesting listen, and a verification that Gainsbourg is an artist worth keeping an ear on.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 1\/2"}

{"text":"poc\n\n pocket can't buy back the time you've just wasted. Occasional exposure to albums like this are actually to be recommended for anyone pretending to be a music critic; they give you a grounding. If your listening diet is nothing but critically lavished and 'important' albums, it's easy to lose sight of where the borders of Sturgeon's Law are to be drawn. Sturgeon said that 90 per cent of everything is crap, and he was right; but his 90 per cent doesn't apply to the vaguely disappointing third albums from your favourite band, or slightly underwhelming debuts from hyped-up new scenesters. It's stuff like this, Hello Wave, that floats under the water waiting to sink your ship.\n\nIt makes no-one feel big or clever to lay into a well-meaning musician who operates entirely for love not money. Sweet Baboo's Stephen Black is probably a good guy who'd buy you a pint if you shook his hand and told him you enjoyed his music. And that must be why this album, his second, exists, because of stingy, thirsty sycophants. It's only 36 minutes long and it's difficult to get through. The first song, laboriously titled 'If I'm Still In Love When I Get Back Home From Travelling (America)' is the same knowingly cheesy novelty song the every-night resident at your local live music bar plays under the presupposition that the simple act of playing a guitar and singing is entertainment enough for folks. That's why you avoid that bar, because it isn't. Here is also where the first signs of Sweet Baboo's tedious 'quirkiness' arise: he nonsensically interjects \"cheese!\" after referring to the city of Philadelphia har har; he claims to have shot a seagull and then admits to making it up, cos he's wacky like that; and you know when he twice concedes he was \"quite drunk\" that it can't be a winking understatement because these drunk stories are rubbish. But he decided to write a song about them anyway.\n\nIt's got to get better and it does, kinda, marginally. The following song sports some niftily agile fingerpicking and third track, 'It's Three Let's Go', is a shuffling Broken Social Scene intro extended into a pleasant enough three minute-long instrumental. But don't lose track of your standards just yet. Stephen Black's voice has yet to show any more expressiveness than my dog's, and his personality is somewhat harder to locate too. In 'Hello Bullfrog, Hello Wave' -- we're at track seven now - Black fantasises about being washed away by a river into the sea, drearingly singing \"take me from here, to there, from there, to here, from here, to there\" for, god, ages. At 5:05 it's hardly an epic, but it's the longest song on the album by a full minute, and it really feels like it. He's melancholy, because pretty girls don't reciprocate his feelings, and his rabbit died and there's other odd references to death, but he still hasn't given me a reason, in his lyrics or his melodies, to give a fuck. \"In the night sky I hear him calling me,\" he begins the next song, and if you read that in a booming Nick Cave voice it could seem quite dramatic: \"and although my hands aren't tied and I tried with all my might, the demons have a hold and I've got no place left to go.\" But Sweet Baboo isn't Nick Cave, so he's singing it lightly over a jaunty two-chord campfire singalong strum. I could be listening to 'Stagger Lee', but no, I'm listening to 'Kumbaya' instead.\n\nAnd then he interjects \"Steve!\" after \"I hear him calling me\", to further demean his own declared demons, and I wonder if even the Monday night guy down the road would sing this song to three punters and the barman. It's hard to think of a 36 minute-long record as indulgent, but Hello Wave is about half-an-hour longer than it ever earns.\n\nas far as i'm aware, the people who run businessman records are doing so out of their own pocket as they love the music they are promoting. There must be easier ways to get someone to buy you a drink. the album is a delight. You, sir, are wrong on at least two accounts.\n\nIt's your second ever review on a national website (one click on your name suggests) and you choose to be lay in to something self-funded, virtually unknown, completely independant, and clearly not to your taste. I can't begin to understand the thought behind this. What a fucking prick.\n\nit resulted from getting the same \"who wants to review what\" email that all the writers do, taking a punt on something very probably unfamiliar, thinking it sucked and then saying so in the form of a review. Not endorsing the sentiment therein, per se, just saying how these things tend to come about\n\nit never ceases to amaze me how people still mistake \"reviews they don't agree with\" for \"bad reviews\". After seeing the negative comments on this review (and after having agreed with the author before from afar) i decided to listen to the artist in question. Fucking hell.. to think that people actually like this sort of thing. This bland, irritating, devoid of all but the most base elements of music sort of thing\n\nShamelessly rip off Thurston Moore and get a guaranteed 9\/10.\nDare to pick up an acoustic guitar? FUCK. OFF.\nIt's not the greatest record of the year but 2\/10 only serves to make the author look like a bit of a cunt.\n\nI saw Sweet Baboo a couple of years ago supporting Euros Childs at King Tuts. He wasn't originally supposed to be the support act and i have to say i though at the time that this was a joke act rigged up by someone at the last minute.\n\nIt just had a feeling of the muzical equivalent of an episode of the Office. As such the bloke i was with thought it was pretty funny and rather enjoyed it. Personally I though it was a load of old cobblers.\n\nStill I have to admit I'm bemused that such an act could have become something to be taken seriously - although we had differing opinions on how much we enjoyed it we both were convinced that this was a joke act. Maybe it's evolved into somehting else over the last couple of years - but if it hasn't reviews of 2 out of ten don't suprise me in the least.\n\nI feel a bit like you sometimes; often blurting out a desire for musicians to apply for a license before being allowed to release music. I suppose it would reduce the 90 percentile by a good margin. However, after reading this dross (having listened to most of baboo's back catalogue) I can't help feeling I've been wrong all along. After all, if we were to introduce a ridiculous system of licensing there is the distinct possibility that the pass n fail rates would be decided by someone like yourself. If you can't hear the references (BSS?FFS) or appreciate playful lyricism then you should stick to reviewing music you are comfortable with. Debate about the right to an opinion is only relevant when the opinion in question is an informed one. Sorry, I guess spewing bile is contagious.\n\nI saw Sweet Baboo play the other day and I thought he was embarrassingly awful, the worst thing I've seen in AGES. I've nothing against comedy-type music that is actually good, ie HMHB, Frank Sidebottom, Tom Lehrer, Ivor Cutler. Even the Colbert Christmas album is pretty good. But this was student zaniness, for fuck's sake. He thinks he's funny and cute and he's neither. So I can quite believe the album is as bad as the review says.\n\nAlly Brown, if you cannot assess music objectively without being overwhelmed by selfish hysterical emotional cynicism, you should not be reviewing anything. You boring infant. You are no journalist, sir. Your writing is appalling. Stick to YouTube video blogs about the latest from Nick Cave, he's so alternative, isn't he? Daft winnit.\n\nAlly Brown, if you cannot assess music without being overwhelmed by hysterical emotional cynicism, you should not be reviewing anything ever. You boring infant. Your writing is appalling. Maybe stick to the trailer park of the internet posting video blogs about the latest from Nick Cave, he's so sophisticated, isn't he? Daft winnit.\n\nSteve wouldnt be the slighteset bit bothered with the negative review. who cares, he does what he loves and thats the end of that... some people cant stand it, and some people like it. I blame the increase in MA's and BA's in humanities. Too many people analysing art. Its just what people do, like draw, or polay football...\n\nDear Ally. Well done, that is how the big boys write grown up reviews. However, you're only part way there as you also need to understand musical references, and frankly, your arse from your elbow. Sweet Baboo is in fact not sending himself up, nor you, nor me. He is making work in a genre not usually heard here. If it really is true that all you can hear is Half Man Half Biscuit, then you're disappearing up a blind one; you'll be head of cock rock at NME in no time. I'm sorry your soul has died."}

{"text":"When scientists want to look at the effect of a variable in a given scenario, they remove or replace it, then see what happens. It's impossible to be rigorously scientific about human nature, but the empirical approach still has some clues to offer when it comes to group dynamics.\n\nTake for example the group led by Polish trumpeter Tomasz Stanko. Since recruiting his backing trio as teenagers in 1993, he's spent a good deal of time working with them in performance and on record, including the remarkable Soul of Things and Suspended Night from 2002 and 2004, respectively. These recordings have rolled out like light shimmering on mist, exploring focused lyricism through nuance and subtlety.\n\nWhat happens when Stanko is removed from this group? We have the evidence in the form of Trio, which documents the so-called Simple Acoustic Trio that has been headlining bandstands in Poland. To be frank, it's like the mist without the light. There's something about this music that envelops you and seeps into your skin, drawing you in and not letting go. But when you free yourself from its wet embrace, you feel like maybe you missed the message. Or maybe there really wasn't any. Or maybe Stanko's like a beacon that can't be replaced. It's hard to know in any exact sense.\n\nThese guys weren't even thirty when they laid down these tracks a year ago, and to their credit they're still the intuitive, free-thinking core unit they've been all along. Marcin Wasilewski's piano playing is lyrical at heart, building from simple melodies and incorporating indirect shades of gospel. Bassist Slawomir Kurkiewicz has a way of getting in and around the center of the music without crowding it or being obvious; Michael Miskiewicz's brushwork is the very definition of lush, probably contributing as much to the misty feel of the music as Wasilewski's predilection for pedaling. When he picks up sticks, he's more Motian than DeJohnette, in any case.\n\nThe music on the record is generally low-key and pensive; it includes eight composed pieces, one each by Wayne Shorter and Bj\u00f6rk, and five completely improvised tracks. The pure improv has an involving, mysterious aspect that tends to be more interesting because of its abstraction and unpredictability. The second track, Bj\u00f6rk's \"Hyperballad,\" is surreally beautiful, creeping up gradually but grabbing you in full embrace once its anthemic theme kicks in. (Speaking of kicking in, the first track takes five seconds to actually start, an incredibly annoying and self-indulgent ECM \"quirk\" that serves neither artist nor audience.)\n\nIn the end, this record just never breaks out of that seeping foggy feeling. I spent three days listening to it almost in isolation, and returning weeks later, it's surprising how little that experience has changed. This Trio sucks you in for sure, but it doesn't really satisfy in any visceral way. I miss Tomasz Stanko."}
{"text":"12. Cardinology (2008): It bears asking: Which would you rather see, Ryan Adams taking a few chances and coming up with severely mixed results, or Ryan Adams playing it safe and delivering something \u2026 safe? There's no correct answer to that question, but I feel like Adams's music serves as his own response: Since his insane 2005 (more on that later), Adams has slowed his pace (slightly) and produced music that (mostly) falls squarely into the framework established on his three most revered albums: Heartbreaker, Cold Roses, and Jacksonville City Nights. Cardinology is by no means a bad album, but I'd say it's the closest Ryan Adams has come to a \"generic\" album. Some of the songs are magical, of course (\"Go Easy,\" \"Stop\"), others are forgettable (\"Fix It\"). If I were introducing someone to Ryan Adams's music, and I had to choose between, say, Rock N Roll or Cardinology, I'd give them Cardinology every time, because it more perfectly encapsulates what the man does, but if I'm reaching for one or the other, it's probably Rock N Roll, because that album has a flawed charm its very own, while Cardinology has been done better elsewhere."}

If you are looking for a disc of music that doesn't rock any boats and offers a pleasantly honest gift of skills, then look no further than Samantha Crain's Kid Face. This is one of those albums with the dual advantage of sharing music that caters both to the listener and the musician; there are no surprises or detours from Crain's voice and talents.\n\nThe music is soft and melodic and shares with the listener both a range of skills and emotions. There is a certain amount of safety in her songs because none of them seem to challenge her full potential as an artist, but that is beside the point. Thankfully, for knowing her range, Crain does not stray from the roots that ground and sweeten her abilities. There are no self-indulgent or experimental failures waiting to pop like an overripe melon and ruin the overall effect.\n\nWhat's most appealing about this disc is how little effort it needs to be appealing. It certainly has the calm, average, girl-next-door-writing-in-in-her-diary sound to it, but that's not necessarily a bad trait to have. On a comparative scale, you would find the songs somewhere between the white noise of your day and the opening act of a much-awaited concert; it's always there, but without the push to be at the front of the line.\n\nKid Face is a mature and responsible display of raw talent. It's very grown-up. Crain manages to hit every base as she rounds the field and create an album that's just enough to satiate the listener's tastes.

{"text":"The Trip\n\nOn first listen, Laetitia Sadier's solo debut--not counting the three albums by her former side project Monade, the first of which was almost entirely a homemade affair--sounds close enough to later Stereolab albums that a fellow Critical Mob staffer wondered aloud why the band bothered to break up. But just as each Stereolab album had subtle but important differences from the one before, The Trip reveals its unique aspects upon closer examination. The obvious difference is the relative lack of electronics: Sadier herself plays only guitar, and the vintage synthesizers are otherwise kept in check, coloring the songs rather than anchoring them. The overall vibe is often reminiscent of Sadier's beloved vintage '60s sunshine pop, most notably on a springy cover of \"By the Sea\" by cult favorites Wendy and Bonnie, which features an interlude of wordless harmonies directly reminiscent of The Free Design, the sibling act that Stereolab named a 1999 single after. The other two covers, sultry takes on Les Rita Mitsouko's mid-'80s dance hit \"Un Soir, Un Chien\" and the Gershwin standard \"Summertime,\" prove yet again Sadier's eternal hipness, but it's her original songs that stand out: after 20 years singing oblique, often theoretical lyrics, there's a startling first-person directness to songs like \"One Million Year Trip\" and \"Another Monster.\" Recorded half with her former Monade bandmates Emmanuel Mario and Julien Gasc and half with California polymath Richard Swift, the album nonetheless sounds remarkably uniform, testament to Sadier's singular musical"}

Since 2009 they've been playing music under the name of Wet Wings, a band name that appears on Twitter when people tweet about their infatuation with (greasy) wet (chicken) wings. We recently spoke to Wet Wings about their track, Feeeel It, which features on the RUBY album.\n\nWhat is the inspiration behind the song? What is it about?\n\nThis song is about ghosts, superstition, and other nonscientific whimsy.\n\nWho did you work with on the song?\n\nThis song has Lucy and Darian playing all the instruments but Jon Lemmon did the mastering to make sure the song didn't hurt people's ears.\n\nDoes it have a video? What is that about?\n\nThis song does have a video. We haven't spoken to the people who made the video, Johnny Lyon and Sophia Jenny, about the video very much. But they did a great job. Sophia's in a field running around, getting some exercise.\n\nWhat other New Zealand artists do you look up to?\n\nJoseph Ernest Harper (comedy), Jonathan Phillips\/Mount Pleasant, Jon Lemmon, Jonathan Bree. If your name starts with Jo, you are someone we look up to. Lucy hastens to add that she also loves Bachelorette.\n\nWhat instruments do you play?\n\nWe sing over guitar, keyboard (primarily a Casiotone MT-45 or Casiotone. MT-65 for when we want the extra 20 MTs), some viola, and programmed beats. There is also clarinet and flute on the album thanks to family.\n\nWhat do you consider when you are getting dressed to perform (clothes\/makeup\/hair do etc)?\n\nNot embarrassing ourselves. Once I accidentally wore a pair of cords that make it look like I have a constant erection. I'm not that virile."}

{"text":"Probably my favorite desperate co-dependent junkie love song of all time. There's a deep off-kilter sadness and emptiness at play throughout, with the narrator simultaneously promising to be the one who'll save the day and fix everything but also needing to be rescued himself and getting increasingly crazed and frantic as the song progresses. Of course, the only possible way to fix anything here is through a grand escape to some unknown land, and that's a defeat in itself and impossible. The song is obsessed with possibilities and all the things the narrator could do, but in the end nothing actually changes. I interpret the \"if I could take the fire out from the wire\" line as a drug reference, but you can interpret it as any kind of continuing problem and the overall effect remains the same. There's a constant pain keeping things from being how the narrator thinks they could be, but there's no solution. All we get is the dream of hopeless freedom where none of your choices actually have a meaning to anyone outside of yourself and you're free to do anything, including destroy yourself.\n\nI know that makes the song come off as super dark and depressing, but I sincerely love it. It perfectly encapsulates the feeling of wanting to solve someone's life for them but feeling powerless and just dreaming of how you could save them and yourself. The \"look at the trees and look at my face and look at a place far away from here\" has one of the most heart-wrenching vocals ever, and that sweeping musical lift prior to the return to the 1st verse is flawless. It's Arcade Fire indie epicness before Arcade Fire even existed, and the music keeps the song from drowning in its depression, matching up with the lyrics but keeping things from getting too downtempo.\n\nHer Name is Calla are an up-and-coming British band with a penchant for creating beautiful and atmospheric music. This track, from their upcoming debut album The Quiet Lamb, is slower to start than I would normally like, but the beautiful harmonies reminiscent of Grizzly Bear keep things interesting enough until the delicate but stoic main vocals kicks in that I don't mind. The violin at 2:35 provide a nice instrumental lift, and the song doesn't stop building from there. The drums kick in and, along with the increase in strings and use of brass, give the song a sweeping sense of grandeur. The wailing vocal calls to mind Damien Rice's better moments, and everything comes together beautifully for a hypnotic climax from 5:30-5:55, before returning to the softer tones of the first minute, completing the movement wonderfully in both a musical and emotional sense. The song's one weak point is the lyrics, but the music and vocals are evocative enough that some lyrical slightness can be forgiven and you can be drawn into and wrapped up in the mood \"Pour More Oil\" creates.\n\nHow I was wrong, tingling from the kill Tickle me until, you devil bird you evil still Slept on my arms, I was sleeping in the sill I was sleeping in the room with you You little boy, you little boy\n\nHow could you run from me now? The loneliest chime in the house The loneliest chime in the house You let it out, you let it out Come to me Calvary still I'm weeding and raking until I'm bleeding in spite of my love for you It bruised and bruised my will\n\nThis song has been haunting me for the last week, and I haven't been able to figure out a full interpretation for it, which is going to slowly drive me insane. I can see it being about a relationship where the narrator cares much more than the other person and is abandoned, with anger and violence leading to sex that still ends with the narrator being ultimately alone. But I can also see it being about a sexual relationship between two male friends that both are conflicted over and that gets derailed after one reveals what's going on to others, leading the narrator to be unable to deal with his feelings and leave the other person alone and waiting forever. (I'm hoping I'm not just projecting that and that other people see it in the text too) It's the most raw and sadly beautiful moment on an EP filled with ennui, angst, crises of faith, and neediness. Sufjan utilizes just the piano here, and his playing is largely delicate and sparse with fuller more classical moments occuring later and keeping the music from becoming repetitive. The focus is on Sufjan's lonely and pain-soaked vocal, which has a much more mature tone to it than on Illinois and less of the affected shakiness that characterized his higher vocals on that record, resulting in a song that's memorable and devastating.\n\nAs it becomes more and more likely that there will never be another Postal Service record, it's easy to forget about how much I used to love a lot of that record before the songs were used in every commercial ever and got tired. I recently rediscovered this remix, which keeps the lonely shoegazing emo kid emotions and lyrics of the original version intact but adds some nice thump and a futuristic synth part so that you can groove along in your misery. It drags in the middle, but the explosion at 4:32 makes up for that, and is more effective because of how the song made you wait for it, which is something almost all dance remixes try to achieve but only a few nail.\n\nI saw Cymbals Eat Guitars play a Lollapalooza pre-show tonight, and it was a good show with one flaw that kept it from greatness. In terms of the music and vocals, it was excellent, with the band being both intense and fluid but still precise when they needed to be. There was a lot of new material, almost all of which represented a significant leap forward including one track that had a far better hook than anything on their debut album. The sound mix and quick pace of the songs made it difficult to catch any lyrics, but I don't doubt that they'll be at least the same quality lyrically as the older songs. They also did a delightfully messy and high-energy cover of Superchunk's \"Detroit Has A Skyline\", which was also recorded for The AV Club and should be available soon. The show's problem lay in a lack of real connection to the audience. Joe D'Agostino spends 90% of the show staring off to his right with his eyes closed or bent over his guitar, and the rest of the band (besides the bass player who made a few comments) was silent. Joe's behavior can probably be attributed to needing to concentrate due to the difficulty of a lot of the band's guitar parts and vocals but it made it significantly harder to connect with the performance, especially since between song banter was minimal. I will give him one thing though: he does the best microphone fellatio since early 90's Tori Amos, with a wide open mouth millimeters from the mic much of the night. I also met Joe briefly after the show and he was very friendly and nice. We talked about when the next album was going to come out (not until next year), what other bands were playing (including Lady Gaga, who one of the band members sorta-knows) and the last time I saw them, at Generation Records a few months ago. All in all, it was a show I was glad I went to, despite being pretty exhausted from getting less than 3 hours of sleep last night, and I'm looking forward to seeing them again tomorrow at Lolla.\n\nSo I know that Best Coast is all anyone's talked about the last couple days and the full-on backlash is about to begin, but Pitchfork is actually right about this record. It's a lot of fun and a very good indie beach album. The simplicity and obviousness in its lyrics are indicative of pop genius, not stupidity, since the key to a good pop song beyond a great hook is relatable lyrics, and\n\nI lost my job I miss my mom I wish my cat could talk Everytime you leave this house, everything falls apart\n\nWell, I don't love you, and I don't hate you I don't know how I feel\n\nare absolutely things everyone has thought or felt at some point. (Come on, you know you wish your pets could talk. My sister and I frequently talk about what our dogs would sound like, complete with accents and goofy speech patterns, when we get bored.) The same holds true for the lyrics of the rest of the album. Even on first listen, these songs felt familiar, because the lyrics are things I think every time I'm in a dysfunctional relationship, which is you know\u2026 a lot of the time. The simple repetitive lyrics fit with the musical tone of the record, which sounds less like the \"classic indie pop\" Larry Fitzmaurice makes a vague comparison to in his review, and more like 50s\/60s girl group pop updated for 2010 and given a little stoner haze in the production.\n\nDo I think the record is going to be an enduring classic? Absolutely not, but it's enjoyable to relax and chill with, making for a light and fun counterpoint to the heavier, pretentious, and drama-laden songs I usually listen to. This record is so unpretentious that it almost loops back around and becomes pretentious in its simplicity, which is the source for a lot of the negativity around it I think, but let's just listen to some music that's fun and focus on just enjoying things for once. I almost can't believe I said that, since I'm king of over-interpreting stuff (see: allmyToriAmosposts), but sometimes it's nice to listen to something and appreciate it at face value, and that's what Best Coast songs are designed for.\n\nSufjan, please come back, I miss you. If you don't pay attention to the lyrics, this is a very pretty and soothing song. Once you realize it's about Sufjan and his siblings discovering their father having an affair and Sufjan feeling abandoned afterward, it becomes a bit more intense. The song has a childlike pettiness to it at points (it's titled The Mistress Witch for starters) and there's a lot of anger covered up by Sufjan's calmness and lovely falsetto. That quiver is his voice on \"He left us now for dead\" is just gut-wrenching though, and reveals more pain and emotion in 3 seconds than most artists do in an album's worth of material.\n\nShe had a name, she had a spirit She had a line in the play if you waited to hear it But a master of disguises\u2026 Her demise was her design, they said \"Was it the mending of the gown or the running it around?\" She said: \"My name and my spirit are both corrupt And if you hold me close you gotta hold me up It was the tender meaning of this slender gown That brought me bending to the ground Now you'll wear any old thing, oh you'll wear any old thing\"\n\nThere's such an intensity to this song, it feels like it could spiral out of control at any second, like Spencer Krug and the band are just barely keeping it together. The song threatens to overtake them, but they tame it while still keeping the frenetic energy. Lyrically, the song is stunning. In just the part of the verse I've quoted above there's so much expressed beautifully: the idea of the girl, forgotten and ignored, feeling she's been made weak and evil, someone who was committed to beauty but who's been destroyed by the effort and has given up. As the song moves into the next verse, the anger that's been lurking under the surface boils over with the sarcastic vocal on \"It's an act I think she's just pretending\", and the control slips as we hit the song's emotional climax of \"Burn the virgin flags and I will shake (shake!)\", expressing the pain at the loss of everything he wanted. After that, the song finally does spiral out of control going into the \"see the paddle go up, and go down\" finish, where he surrenders and revels in destruction, but by then it's a conscious choice (both in terms of the narrative and in the band's performance).\n\nSo she wrapped herself in swaddling That the fever deviated to a broken wing \"It's an act, I think she's just pretending\" Burn the virgin flags and I will shake (shake!) As the heat waves in the sand This one's for Maggie This one's for Sam Or any other random spirit lover Busted I have lusted after you The way bloodsuckers do\n\nP.S. How ridiculous is it that the Pitchfork staffers are just sitting and staring blankly at their computers the whole time this performance is going on? That lends it an almost surreal quality as well."}
{"text":"Saturday, October 24, 2009\n\n\"After a quietly intense set from Holly Miranda, Cymbals Eat Guitars took the stage at Le Poisson Rouge and delivered a noisy and intense set. They haven't been together as a band very long, but already they're playing like veterans, running through tracks from their debut, Why There Are Mountains, at a fevered clip without sacrificing precision or dynamics.\n\nOpener \"...And the Hazy Sea\" introduced their pattern of attack and subside: The song peaked multiple times, faked an ending, then finally closed plainly and simply. On record, the structure sounds almost improvised, but onstage it came across as mapped out and purposeful even as it toyed with the audience's expectations-- and this crowd obviously knew the song already.\n\nSinger Joseph D'Agostino was an imposing frontman who must have been dehydrated after the show. He was sweating profusely by the end of the first song, and spent the rest of the set contorting violently and playing his guitar like it was trying to eat him. A new song, titled \"Plainclothes\", sees him growing more adventurous as a songwriter, employing concrete narrative details and crisp lyrical imagery, and showed the band becoming much more confident in their quiet-loud dynamics. Even on quieter numbers like \"Tunguska\", they never lose their volubility, but seemed always poised to pounce at any moment. More often than not, they did. Cymbals weren't just loud, they sounded monumental."}

{"text":"Allo Darlin'\n\nOh, the sweet lullabies of an English voice sung in the key of pop. Well, Elizabeth Morris is actually a Queenslander, but after relocating to the United Kingdom seven years ago and jumping full-force into the vast musical pool, she pretty much qualifies. As for the group she fronts alongside Paul Rains, Bill Botting and Mikey Collins? They're called Allo Darlin', and you might find them charming, playful and a damn good time, in a vein relevant to contemporaries like Standard Fare and Evans The Death. Currently abroad and toting along they're second full-length LP, Europe, Morris caught up with Synthesis while still cozy in her London abode.\n\nSo Allo Darlin' has toured abroad several times now. How do you find the audiences in the U.S. compared to the U.K.?\n\nQuite a big difference. People from the States in general are really lovely and enthusiastic, almost a bit like puppies [laughs], if you don't mind me saying; people are really excited and over-the-top and it's nice. Whereas people from the U.K. can be a lot more withdrawn and bit more reserved and held back, still really warm, but don't necessarily dance at shows. The other difference we've found is that we might be playing on more mixed bills; people from all different walks of life and genres. Whereas over here it's quite specific, and a bit more sceney, you could say. Like we were asked to play a punk festival last year in Austin, Chaos in Tejas, which was really awesome, and it was like, \"Wow! You think we fit on a bill with all these anarchistic punk rock bands?\"\n\nI had an interview with Veronica Falls a while back, and we were talking about the genre of twee-pop and how in the U.K. that's kind of a dirty word, but over here it's not at all. Often I'll hear Allo Darlin' get a twee-pop label\u2014does that bother you?\n\nNo. Sometimes I think it's a thing where if we get called that in the States we're not bothered by it, because we know it means something quite different [than] over here. To be honest, the genre of music is probably the same, but over here, if people hear something described as twee, they probably think that they won't like it\u2014it's definitely a pejorative. And that's the annoying thing, if it puts people off unnecessarily.\n\nI would relate it to using emo to categorize a band in the States. It has a lot of negative connotations surrounding it.\n\nAnd maybe, in a similar way, emo has a lot to do with emo haircuts and style, and I think the twee thing has a lot to do with the clothes people wear. Like the Zooey Deschanel comedy New Girl\u2014it's the clothes that she wears almost more than what she says. I think fashion has a lot to do with it.\n\nI really like the new record. When I listen to Europe and compare it to the self-titled, I notice that it's a little more polished, but in a tasteful way. Did you work with a new producer or just take some different angles?\n\nSimon, who we recorded and produced the first album with, we actually took with us, mainly because the [prior] studio was really small; you could just fit a band in there. So we went to a studio outside Manchester called Analog Catalogue, and it's really plush and beautiful [with] lots of beautiful old gear that came from Strawberry Studios; the stuff that New Order used. So we did that session first, and that was all recorded to tape, and the second session was in the autumn of last year at a studio here in London called Bark. But Simon was with us the whole time, and the main difference production-wise was the time we took recording it and how much more considered we were. We didn't know that we had an audience when we made that first album; we were just making it for ourselves and a very small community here in London.\n\nThroughout the album there seems to be a lyrical theme of people and places that's sort of melancholy in some ways, but still pretty positive.\n\nAt the time I was writing a lot of the songs, I had about 12 months to run on my Visa\u2014which means you've really got to start sorting it out\u2014and I didn't know how I was going to be able to stay. And that was really affecting me. I was thinking, \"What if I have to leave?\" Because I've spent most of my adult life here in the U.K. or in Europe, and I was thinking about having to go back. It was affecting a lot of the songs I was writing, so I just tried to focus and bring that out more.\n\nOn \"Tallulah,\" it seems like you're singing about being homesick from Queensland. You still homesick in a little way?\n\nOh, definitely. There's lots of amazing things there; it's such an isolated place. It's one of these things like if you're having a long-distance relationship with someone, absence really does make the heart grow fonder, and you sort of romanticize things in your head, and then you go back and maybe it's not quite as nice as it was in your brain. But it's definitely where my heart kind of ultimately is, and I would love to go back there; but I don't know if it would ever match up to what it is in my head.\n\nEspecially for a musician\u2014not the same opportunity, I'm sure.\n\nThat was the whole reason why I moved to the U.K.\u2014I wanted to be in a band and I just wanted to be like the Go-Betweens, really."}

{"text":"Stranger Personals\n\nCan! What? Named after a verb meaning \"know how to\" or \"be able to\" and\/or a noun meaning \"a usually cylindrical receptacle,\"* Can are what is known as \"krautrock,\" a sort-of genre that's just a name for late-'60s German rock. The first important thing about Can, if you are a music dummy, is that people think they're important. For instance, at least half the bands I've written about for this column famously love Can (Siouxsie and the Banshees, Suicide, PiL, Brian Eno).\n\nAlso, let's talk about this album cover. IT IS SO GREAT! The typeface, the curlicue brains, the speech bubble, the big orange head... amazing.\n\nThe album begins with little wormy guitar tickles, then a psychedelic waowmp intro. I can't tell if\/when they are speaking English. But I do think that drums are the centerpiece of krautrock. In fact, there is an 18-minute song on this album that is basically just drums. There's some rock piano, of which I heartily approve. Also, at some point, they sing about a snowman. I swear.\n\nThe drum song, \"Halleluhwah,\" goes on forever. It's amazing. Over the drums, they torture a crow, then make fun of a violin, then a tiger arrives for just a second. The song feels like a prank\u2014there have to be jokes you could play with it. \"Here, I made you this mix CD!\" (Entire track list: \"1. Halleluhwah \u2013 Can.\")\n\nThe early part of the next track, \"Aumgn,\" seems to have been created by dissecting a clock and then playing a banjo with clock guts. It would make a good accompaniment to a trippy time-travel sequence. Also, they might be chanting.\n\nHoo-boy, so much chanting! But more like creepy back-of-your-throat noises, like you'd make if you were doing a monster impression to scare your little brother. This should be used as a haunted-house soundtrack! Inconveniently for me, but excellent for haunted houses, this song is also a hundred minutes long (17:33).\n\nGARBAGE NOISE!!! Aaaand barking dog break! And then they do Stomp, that percussion-based theater piece from the '90s where they play garbage cans.\n\nI wondered how much of their music was planned or practiced (\"Okay, hit that bucket with your drumstick, great, now jingle bells! Go!\"), because it sounds totally improvised. Turns out: Can are famous for \"spontaneous composition.\" Called it!\n\nI give this a \"spontaneous music criticism\" out of 10.\n\n*Side note\/hot tip: Usually, when a writer opens with a dictionary definition, it is code for \"I am fucked for ideas and this was due yesterday.\" But really, what kind of name is this, you awesome weirdos? It is just impossibly simplistic and silly. I am so amused. Also, this was due yesterday.\n\nPlease, Aphrodite's Child: 666, please.

Most are Tri-State suburbanites who as kids went to Manhattan to party and as adults go there to work.\n\nTheir imperfect lives of privilege receive more direct attention from Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger, the singing-songwriting team known as Fountains of Wayne. On the their third album, \"Welcome Interstate Managers,\" the duo move beyond short stories of adolescent yearning among the subdivisions to more adult themes, but without losing their taste for sweet radio-ready pop. The white-collar orcs who stumble through the album's tales of urban angst and suburban lassitude can't understand why life isn't as good as their guidance counselors told them it would be. A self-assured Wall Street type drinks his way uptown, wondering how his lover would willingly leave New York \"for no better place.\" A novice account executive with \"a new computer and a bright future in sales\" wakes up hung over in the Port Authority Bus Terminal. In other words, they're either losers in love who wait in vain for the \"little red light\" to blink on their message machines, or losers at work who can never \"get the numbers to add up right.\"\n\nBy expanding their '60s pop palette to include psychedelia, country and light jazz, FoW also expand the scope of their stories.

He's known for mixing the Beatles and Jay-Z in the most famous mash-up album of all time, \"The Grey Album\", and he's worked with plenty of talented artists, including Cee-Lo Green (in Gnarls Barkley) and most recently James Mercer from the Shins (in Broken Bells):\n\n2. Eek-A-Mouse\n\nEek-A-Mouse's \"Wa-Do-Dem\" album. A good place to start your Eeksperience.I saw Eek-A-Mouse perform live some years ago at the Bluebird in Bloomington, IN. He puts on a good show, and though the Eek-A-Mouse \"Eeksperience\" website is slightly on the ugly side, the name inspires a cute enough mental image to deserve a spot on the list.\n\n3. Modest Mouse\n\nAn indie-rock-gone-major fave, Modest Mouse have been cranking out some great tunes for awhile now. One of their older albums, \"The Moon and Antarctica\", is highly recommended, especially if you've never heard of Modest Mouse before or if you're only familiar with the newer stuff.\n\n4. Mouse on Mars\n\nMouse on Mars \"Live 04\" album: as the cover's lips and cop car suggest, it's a mix of pulsing live music with a hard edge. Or something.Mouse on Mars often make electronic that's complex, noisy, or just plain unlistenable - like hearing machines torture each other. But Mouse on Mars also make electronic instruments sound vibrant and alive, as they do on the often-funky and sometimes danceable \"Live 04\" album:\n\n5. Korgis\n\nOkay, so the first and nearly last time I was exposed to the Korgis was when I bought \"Best of Techno Vol. 3\" nearly two decades ago, which led off with NRG's \"I Need Your Love\" (below), a song centered ona sample of the Korgis' \"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime.\"\n\nBritish version of the German Dachshund?At any rate, I still don't know much about the Korgis other than the fact that they're British and they share their name (well, except for the first letter) with the super-cute, super-short-legged Corgi dog and deserve to be on this list for that alone.\n\n6. Bunny Rabbit\n\nBunny Rabbit: more like 2 Live Crew, less like Peter Cottontail.Don't buy a Bunny Rabbit album with the intention of giving it to your kids. Bunny Rabbit may seem like a given for this list, but she has a deceptively cute name: the music is seductively ominous, not sweetly twee. It's generally simple with lots of funky electronic beats and some NSFW lyrics, so beware. Put your headphones on and check out \"Saddle Up\":\n\n7. The Bird and the Bee\n\nKinda like Bunny Rabbit's childishly sweet name and her more adult-oriented music, when you hear the term \"the birds and the bees\" you'll first think of cute, then realize the fact that it's a simple, cliched way of referring to human mating when talking to people who aren't old enough to understand what you're talking about. So, just as Bunny Rabbit slipped onto this list for her name alone, the Bird and the Bee get a spot because of the childish connotation to their name.\n\nThe Bird and the Bee have some amazingly addictive songs (\"Do It Again\", \"F*cking Boyfriend\"), powered by the honeyed vocals of Inara George and the sweet pop production of Greg Kurstin, who's worked with everyone from the Flaming Lips to the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Beck to Lily Allen.\n\nAnd what's even cooler about them than their cute name is their tribute album to Hall & Oates (who, unfortunately for this series, are not named after animals but a piece of architecture and a common edible grain), which I just found out about and can't wait to hear all the way through:\n\n8. Miss Kittin\n\nMiss Kittin is a French electronic music DJ. With a name like that, how could she not make this list?\n\nHer Radio Caroline mix has a chill, understated flow that doesn't build to much, but some of her other albums, like \"Batbox\", have a distinctively harder edge. Not quite the juxtaposition that Bunny Rabbit has with her name and music, but close.\n\n9. Britny Fox\n\nOkay, another cute name\/mature music juxtaposition. I don't know much about Britny Fox, other than they were an 80's rock band who liked big hair and big makeup - on themselves. The only other thing I know about them is that somehow their song \"Girlschool\" found its way into my iTunes collection. Only because foxes are cute, Britny Fox manages to squeak by onto this list.\n\n10. Super Furry Animals\n\nKittens, puppies, baby sasquatch(es) - how much cuter can you get than super furry animals? The rock band Super Furry Animals goes through an ugly transformation in their \"Golden Retriever\" video, which also happens to feature a Golden Retriever... and a golden shower.\n\nHonorable Mention: Possum Dixon\n\nAt the risk of destroying any credibility Thursday Friday Saturday has left, Possum Dixon makes their way onto this list in spite of a fairly crappy band name, and the fact that 99% of people don't think possums are cute. But just think of their babies - precious! And we've seen a pet possum curled politely around its owners neck at Seattle's Pike Place Market - precious!\n\nAnd their song \"Watch the Girl Destroy Me\" is one of the power-pop masterpieces of the 90's:"}
{"text":"Blog: Pigeons and Planes\n\nHere's the new single from Black Taxi. Imagine The Killers mixed with Lou Reed . It's kinda like that. Really, the only part that's Lou Reed-esque is the way the lead singer says \"you do what you gotta do, honey!\", but that's my favorite part of the whole song, so count it. If you're in NYC, Black Taxi is playing at Webster Studio on Saturday night (Oct. 23rd). DOWNLOAD: Black Taxi - Do What You Gotta Do | Mediafire"}

{"text":"For Joe Pernice, it's not like the old days, when he could simply hole up in a studio and record a whole album. Making the latest Pernice Brothers release, 'Goodbye, Killer,' required a certain mastery of logistics, Pernice tells Spinner.\n\n\"I live in Canada, my wife works full-time and we have a kid, so I can't just pick up and go,\" Pernice says. \"It takes a lot of time to arrange our schedules.\"\n\nThat meant a series of recording sessions scattered over two years, when Pernice, his brother, Bob, drummer Ric Menck and guitarist James Walbourne would convene in the studio he and his brother built in his manager's house in Dorchester, Mass.\nThe relaxed pace had its benefits.\n\n\"When you're doing it in one fell swoop, there's a time limit on it because of money or studio time and you're rushing to get it done, even though you're chasing down a vision,\" Pernice says. \"I always felt pressured that way, and this time, there was no pressure at all.\"\n\nThe new album, the Pernice Brothers' sixth studio record, is the band's first collection of original songs since Pernice debuted as a novelist last year with 'It Feels So Good When I Stop.' He and his manager, Joyce Linehan, are also co-authors of 'Pernice to Me,' a collection of Pernice quotes Linehan has disseminated via Twitter. Steering the narrative flow of a book is one thing, but Pernice finds his songs don't happen quite the same way.\n\n\"I have to say, I'm not that sophisticated,\" he reveals. \"It's still a vibe thing for me. Like, there's a tune called 'Newport News' on this record. A long time ago, when that song might have begun, I remember thinking, 'I want to write a song about a place,' and Newport News was a good hook. And then that song sort of veered into whatever it is.\""}
{"text":"Taylor Lonardo\n\nThe Low Road\n\nTwo things are clear about bassist (for multiple bands) Taylor Lonardo, after listening to The Low Road: the guy probably listens to everthing from 1930s country to house music, and he probably does nothing but play bass all day long. How else can The Low Road, which is more like the road less traveled, be so diverse and so good?\n\nAll sounds on the record were created with acoustic and electric bass, and Lonardo did all recording and mixing himself at his own Spring Street Studios in Murfreesboro.\n\nFunk sounds jump off the strings in the opener \"Gryphon's Fire\" as some distinct low notes hum in the background. What's so fantastic about this record is that the bass, often neglected in typical four-piece bands, can provide rhythm, melody or both. On the first track, lower pitched bass parts sound off like a saxophone taking a solo.\n\nIf the opener was jazzy, the following \"Henry County Swing\" sounds like a country swing trot with a clopping, sleepy rhythm like horseshoes.\n\nBut Lonardo doesn't stick to that, either. \"Red & Gold\" shapeshifts through watery Pinback-style bass, aimless noises and smooth Deadhead grooves. \"Midtown Blues\" starts with the same eardrum-blowing reverberation as the first five seconds of the Chili Peppers' \"Around the World,\" and then lets loose in a bluesy puddle.\n\nAlmost everything beautiful that the bass can do springs up on The Low Road. \"Electrospank\" shows a variety of voices; the song has a million pulses layered up and talking over each other. The bass goes sour, stretches thin, stutters, bounces and sounds off like a machine gun.\n\nThe record closes with a beautiful goodnight, \"Bella Notte.\" There are no lyrics to any of the tracks, and there doesn't need to be. The bass does all the talking."}

{"text":"Thursday, September 30, 2010\n\nSo, as Steve mentioned, I put together a piece on Brooklyn's The National for this week's print edish. (And yes, we've selected our caption contest winner, though we're still waiting for him\/her to claim the tickets.)\n\nYou can read my story here, and you can peep after the jump to read my interview with The National's Scott Devendorf. He's the mostly-bass-playin' dude. The one who's, according to The New York Times, \"strikingly spare of pate.\" Devendorf and I discussed the dynamics of being in a band with two sets of brothers, what it was like making High Violet, whether or not he and the rest of the band have any idea what frontman Matt Berninger's lyrics are about, Berninger's collaborative relationship with his wife, making music in a hip-ass city and more.\n\nNashville Cream: First off, I know you guys swap instruments quite a bit, but you primarily play bass and some guitar, right?\n\nScott Devendorf: That's right.\n\nNC: OK, cool. Well, I think it's safe to say you guys are kind of a grower band. Not only have you gained more critical acclaim with each release, but your audience also seems to have kind of grown exponentially over the last decade as well. Was there ever a point when you guys said to yourselves, \"Wow, this thing might be sustainable. We might continue to grow and be able to quit our day jobs?\"\n\nSD: [Laughs.] Good question. I don't know if there was ever a day that we said that, but you know, all this stuff has happened in the past 10 years, and I think there were several instances over the course of that time where we did a lot of work and a lot of touring and got to a point where we'd play a big show, or when a record gets picked up by a big label like Beggars Banquet, the label that we were on \u2014 now we're on 4AD. These kinds of moments, or milestones if you will [laughs]. For us it was the little things, where we'd play a big show in Paris and it's sold out. I don't think we're ever felt like, \"Hey, we've made it!\" but I think there were these little things that happened just along the way that are significant to us and sort of made a bit of the hard work pay off, you know? And lately the band has gotten a lot more notoriety and press, and the record charted for the first time and that was a big deal to us. Just like small things along the way. It's never been this overnight situation.\n\nNC: Never been like a moment when it was like, \"Whoa.\"\n\nSD: Yeah, but you know, we played at Radio City this year and that was a huge deal for us. A big famous place in New York, you know, that was kind of wild. With things like that I think we kind of step back once in a while and are like, \"Oh this is really cool.\"\n\nNC: I read that you guys would go into the studio and record sort of instrumental demos more or less that you'll pitch to Matt. Correct me if I'm wrong, but is that still sort of the way you guys do it? Do you build these songs for him to lay lyrics on top of? Is that the process that's best for you guys?\n\nSD: Yeah, it seems like the process that works for us. It's not really the most efficient process. It sometimes can be really frustrating because mainly Aaron or Bryce will write things and Bryan and I will put some ideas in there, too. Usually it's kind of like this little collage in that way, where it's sending out a bunch of stuff to him that he checks out and sees what he can work in with the stuff that he has \u2014 either a melody that he's working on or sometimes not even a song, just kind of like parts or ideas or whatever rhythmic qualities or something they have that sort of fits well with stuff that he's working on. He's not like a musician musician. He has a good ear, and he's a big fan of music, so I think he has a strong idea about what he wants to do with things. Actually, it's frustrating sometimes, because we'll have like 50 or 60 ideas, and maybe only 20 of them were the favorite ones. So it's just kind of like this back and forth process. It's a pretty accurate way to describe it.\n\nNC: Will there ever be a time where he'll just sort of veto an idea, or you guys veto one of his ideas?\n\nSD: [Laughs.] Definitely. It's harder for us to veto his ideas because he's the one writing the lyrics. Sometimes he'll \u2014 not necessarily by nature is he trying to do this, but on the past two records, it'll be \u2026 late in the game before we actually hear a song. We'll work a lot on the music or the idea or there'll be a scratch vocal or something, but we don't know what the final lyrics are, what the song's about until maybe really late in the game. That can be exciting-slash-terrifying.\n\nNC: So you may have a song for months before it even has a title?\n\nSD: Oh yeah. The titles are always the last to come. Usually the titles are the titles of whatever you randomly give the sketches. For a while they were all Civil War battles. [Laughs.] \"Fredericksburg,\" you know. Matt usually names the songs in the end, they're not usually super tricky names.\n\nNC: Some sort of reference to the lyrics, right?\n\nSD: Yeah, or sometimes ... \"Conversation 16\" was totally not related to the lyrics. I think that was almost like a goofy dialogue. Like, if you were readying a movie script and there'd be \"Scene Four,\" or something like that.\n\nNC: That song in particular feels like a slice out of a relationship.\n\nSD: Yeah, exactly.\n\nNC: Past Matt's vocal melodies, does he really contribute much in the way of instrumentation or arrangements, or conversely, do you guys really weigh in on lyrical content?\n\nSD: [Laughs.] Again, it's funny because I'm just thinking about past records. He usually has a lot of strong opinions about the music without any sort of direct musical way to contribute. So he'll kind of describe something as a color or a sound that's, like, some visual reference for it basically. He'll never say, like, \"Play an F-sharp.\" He doesn't know what an F-sharp is. It's more like the feel of something that he's going for, either with the trajectory of the lyrics or music. And we'll try a lot of different sounds and ways of playing. I think with the past records there's a little bit of frustration at some point because he didn't want any finger-picking or something on guitar playing. If we have any sort of signatures aside from the low baritone voice [laughs], you know, it's the sort of interlocking guitar parts and stuff that is played because [Aaron and Bryce] are really good at it, and it's something we like. Having him say, \"Oh, we don't want that at all,\" is kind of like, \"Oh. [Pauses.] OK.\" [Laughs.] Which is fine. I think we're always trying to make different records, and I think by the nature of trying to make different records, you kind of have to build up and tear down a bunch of ideas. It's sort of our way of working. It's frustrating. The process of it gets us to something at least we think is interesting.\n\nNC: We touched on the lyrics a bit. I know they can be a bit cryptic sometimes. Are there ever songs where you guys really don't know what it is he's referencing or talking about?\n\nSD: For sure, yeah. I mean, we like the fact that the lyrics are a bit cryptic, and I think that they are kind of open to interpretation. They're not exactly like, \"Here's the song. I love you, blah blah blah.\" They'd probably be a lot more accessible in the pop music world if they were a little more direct. We sort of like other bands and other music that is not exactly clear. Yeah, but sometimes we are a bit biased to what he's talking about. It can be too cryptic at times, but I think he knows that too. He's sort of always going for something in between clarity and interpretation, so I think in doing that he can go sort of too far in one direction or the other. I think he's always fighting that battle within himself, too. He writes a lot of lyrics with his wife as well. She's a writer, and she helps sort some ideas out, and I think it spices up the lyrics.\n\nNC: Really?\n\nSD: Yeah. I mean, not every song but like on the, I can't remember right off the top of my head, but there's two or three songs on this record that she kind of wrote a big part of or helped write stuff and sort some ideas. So they have a little collaboration thing going on, which is kind of fun for us to watch, because when we're not fighting with him, we get to watch her fight with him. It's kind of fun. It's not really that bad either. I'm being a little dramatic.\n\nNC: Understandable. Just that kind of give and take.\n\nSD: Yeah.\n\nNC: How long did it take you guys to make High Violet? It was probably a year, right?\n\nSD: It was about a year on and off. I mean, we kind of slowed down at the end of touring Boxer, worked on building the studio and then took a break and did this charity record called Dark Was the Night. Well, we just did one song on it, but [Aaron and Bryce] did a lot of curating, working with different artists on that. That was sort of in the downtime when Matt was working on lyrics. We sort of started recording, we did a concert for the Dark Was the Night thing, we did a couple of shows here and there, they did another project of theirs called The Long Count. So yeah, it took a year, but it wasn't like a straight year of recording. It was kind of like, we worked on some stuff then we took a break, and then we went into the studio. We kind of really started focusing on it \u2026 probably, I'd say, late summer of '09 to about when we finished. And then we spent about eight or 10 weeks once we got done recording everything, we went up to the studio to mix, but or mixing process is kind of like recording still. We're still tracking guitars and vocals, everything basically. So that was about eight or 10 weeks, mid- to late-November, and then January and February we mixed it in parts.\n\nNC: So you said you guys built a new studio in this time since the last record?\n\nSD: Yeah, we built the studio, and that's where we did a lot of the recording for High Violet. Like, actually that's where most of the instruments are recorded and some vocals, but we're kind of still trying to figure it out. It's a great space, but it's kind of ... [long pause] Sorry, I tried to pick the quietest street, but it turned out to be the loudest one. [Laughs.] Yeah, we were kind of just wanting to use the studio and then writing, so it was fun. It was fun for us because our process ... excuse me, this is taking a long time to describe [laughs]. It takes a lot longer for us to write than to record, so it's not like we go into the studio for two weeks and track everything and we're done. So having the studio was sort of freedom for us because it wasn't by the hour or whatever. We were able to kind of work on drums for, like, two weeks ... just kind of like tracking a bunch of ideas.\n\nNC: So do you guys sort of start with a wealth of material and ideas and whittle that down, or do you really just build one by one?\n\nSD: We're kind of working on a bunch of stuff at once usually. It's like, we have all these 50 or 60 sort of sketched demo things that some of them were just a piano part, or a guitar part only or whatever, or drums and guitar; just some sort of simple ideas. From there, Matt figures out which ones he can kind of hone in on and start doing stuff for them, and then we kind of add things throughout the way. I mean, obviously we flesh them out a lot more and re-record them and cut them apart. But then for us it's a little archeological. We just kind of throw a bunch of stuff on there and take it away, throw more stuff on, take stuff away. Some of the stuff that's left is, like, the original guitar part might stay or a scratch vocal might stay in and then we'll fill everything else around that or something. It kind of depends on the song.\n\nNC: So with two sets of brothers in the band, does that influence the dynamic a lot? Do you find that there's a lot of Dessner vs. Devendorf spats, or maybe like internal sibling rivalry going on?\n\nSD: Yeah, it's never usually Dessner vs. Devendorf. It's more like Dessner vs. Berninger with, like, Devendorf as U.N. or something. There's a lot of, like, Aaron and Matt kind of like debating and arguing and fighting with each other, because Aaron writes a lot of the music. We'll have to sort of intervene either with ideas or peacemaking process or whatever. It gets heated but it's never downright mean [laughs]. It's usually just everyone really wants one thing or another from a song. It's kind of a democracy, albeit a messed up one.\n\nNC: Well I mean, some of you guys are stuck with each other no matter what.\n\nSD: Yeah, it's sort of great and terrifying [laughs].\n\nNC: Well, I know you guys are from Cincinnati originally, but you're based in Brooklyn now right?\n\nSD: Yeah, well, we've all lived here about anywhere between 12 and 14 years, so the band actually started here, but we're all from there. But we played music really casually before we started this. I mean, Aaron, Bryce, and Bryan had a band together in Ohio, and I had a really, really, really low-key band in college for fun with friends. Everything we've done with The National is all in New York basically.\n\nNC: I'm sure you're well aware there's been quite a surge in indie rock, post-punk and experimental music from Brooklyn. Do you find that kind of inspires you guys to be more prolific, or is it really just kind of like a nuisance that everybody you come across wants you to hear their demo or something like that?\n\nSD: [Laughs.] No, I think it's great, and I think that there's so much different kinds of music. And for a lot of cities, it's not just here, but obviously it's a lot here. I don't know, it definitely inspires us to, you know ... it inspired us to start the band in the first place, to know that all that stuff was happening around us and us being big music fans wanting to do something ourselves. And it probably has the same sort of effect on bands that are just starting now. You see bands from New York, and they're usually really good or at least interesting and I think it's a good thing, I mean there's all kinds of, I mean we're not the most experimental avant-garde unit in town for sure but I think we all like different music ourselves. I think it can only be good having all that stuff happening. All these people being productive makes other people want to be productive.\n\nNC: You guys are obviously in the middle of a record cycle right now, but do you guys have any plans for after this tour, future recording?\n\nSD: Yeah, I mean we're definitely gonna work on another record. We feel like we just kind of finished this one. We're kind of like the band that it's kind of hard for us to write on the road but we kind of try to do it anyways but it's almost like we have to at least the way operated on the last two or three records make a record and then tour for about a year-and-a-half to two years and then kind of disappear for a time and then do something again. We've done enough and now we have the studio if we want to kind of not take three or four years to make a record. We're not the most, like I said, fast-working bunch."}
{"text":"Fans of Grandaddy probably sensed they would one day hear again from Jason Lytle, the band's former singer\/songrwriter\/reluctant leader, for despite its well-documented struggles, Grandaddy proved to be resilient. In fifteen years together, the band produced five critically acclaimed albums. However, while their peers\u2014bands like Coldplay and Bright Eyes\u2014went on to achieve commercial success, Grandaddy, whether by design or by the luck of the draw, found that type of success elusive. Now, Jason Lytle is back. Though he's relocated from Modesto, Calif. to Bozeman, the fifth-largest city in Montana, his distinctive sound is unchanged. This interview by Nina Gregory.\n\nYou're in London right now. How does it feel to be back on tour?\nIt's fine\u2014it's still an experiment, though. I quit doing all this stuff, and I'm seeing little glimpses of why I quit\u2014and I'm still at the front end of what appears to be a number of months of touring. So I'm having to make sure that I deal with it however I can. I'm a loner\u2026 and all of a sudden I'm always around people. Always. Always. The shows are good, though, and Europe's pretty, but I do like my privacy. The tour just started and we sold out of all our merchandise a few days ago. We had no merchandise, so I got what I thought was a good idea. I know this good artist in London\u2014Daryl Waller. I really like his art. So, I went to his studio and hung out\u2026 and I said, 'Hey, let's create a bunch of merchandise.' We went to some dollar stores and bought mousetraps and pillowcases. We've been downstairs in the dressing room like two kids customizing this stuff. All these people keep walking in\u2014and I just want to be that six-year-old kid playing with my coloring book. I do have that to look forward to when I get off the phone with you. I'm not good with too much stimulation. I need silence and you don't get that on tour. The artwork on your new album is really lovely. It's like a children's book with a little twisted take on typography, with branches for your initials. Do you design your album covers yourself?\nYeah\u2014all of the full-length stuff was either designed by me or created by me. I get a lot of enjoyment out of that. It's not a weird power or control thing\u2014I just like to do art. I have an art table all set up in the studio with my musical equipment. In my world all that stuff blends together. Your songs often have a melancholy feel\u2014the last Grandaddy album was like a sad farewell. But now your first solo album opens with, 'Last thing I heard I was left for dead\u2026 I may be limpin', but I'm coming home.' What are you coming home to?\nI'm coming home to that thing that I mentioned before: the little kid sitting in the middle of the room with coloring book and crayons. That's sort of me in the studio. I enjoy getting to that point where I get lost in the whole process of making songs, and over the years it seems that my medium for artwork has shifted\u2014for me, making records is really like painting pictures. It's kind of a celebration for me, getting back to that point. I had almost given up on my ability to get to that point. Your music tends to be very personal\u2014writing from experience and observation. In the past, one subject that arose in your music was life in and around Modesto\u2014the tech bubble, relationships, isolation, the landscape. Even though you no longer live in the Central Valley, do you think about things there\u2014like, say, the housing crisis, which has devastated the area?\nI have always made what I feel to be a concerted effort into pursuing the escapist aspects of making art. I tend to shy away from politics. I like to keep music separate from those things and give you a break for four minutes\u2014maybe even as long as an hour. I always felt I needed to be someplace like Montana. Even in California I always gravitated to places where I had space and there wasn't constant audible and visual clutter. I like to feel as if I have a grasp of what's going on around me, but it takes awhile for me to figure those things out. I can't be always going. I can't deal with constant stimulation. So it's safe to say you're not Twittering.\nThere's just no depth. It's a big waste to see how much you can cram in. It's just going to end up bad. It has to be up to the individual to say, 'That's enough.' But, at that point, your ability to know how to get away from it\u2014you've lost this. It's shrunken\u2014this little something that should have been exercised all those years while keeping up with the race. With all the constant, intrusive forms of communication, do you think the ability to have some intimacy has been lost? Do you have to fight for that in your music or is it just your sound?\nThere is a craft to what I do. I refuse to let a song leave the house until it feels right. Even if it's a stupid joke, it has to be structured and constructed, but it usually comes down to a balance, some discernable form, some human connection. It just happens the smaller and more mellow stuff starts to make me feel a certain way\u2014I come up with lyrics after that, then you come up with this thing that feels like a human made it. I will fly that flag proudly as long as I can. You seem painfully shy. Do you get any joy from performing?\nIt's a weird contrast, performing versus being alone. I grew up around crazy skateboarders, going to parties, getting into fights\u2014there's that whole part of my upbringing. But there's also the part\u2014the introvert kid who can get lost in pages and get lost in the world of headphones\u2026 and at this point I'm just trying to reserve my strength. Because I've narrowed it down to the things that I'm pretty good at. And I don't like spending too much energy or time on things that I'm not good at. I'm saving my energy for the good stuff at this point. And if that comes off as shyness, so be it. I've got a crazy sense of humor and don't mind hanging out. I want to go back to your Grandaddy days for a moment. You toured with Elliott Smith. What did you learn from him?\nHe had a really good sense of humor. Elliott was a really funny guy, which a lot people don't know. He kind of had that thing I was just talking about\u2014reserving your strength. At some point, you realize you're just giving it out, giving it out, giving it out. Then, when it comes time to drive home and get through a hard day, you got 20 minutes left in the show and it's not going the right way and you have to pull out the stops, and you dip into those reserves, I picked up a bit from him. Other than that, I've had a few friends that took this tragic route. He did. I realized that I don't want to be like that. I love being alive and I love having these moments of beauty and experiencing things. It really sucks when you have friends that have died and you realize every time you're having a happy moment\u2014it just makes me wonder why they ended up taking such a tragic route. David Bowie was a big fan of Grandaddy. Do you hear from him? What was it like to have Bowie as a fan?\nIt was pretty neat. More surreal than anything. He was really, really sweet. And oddly enough he was very informed of the albums and the music and songs, specifically. We have a few pictures of the band standing next to him. It doesn't seem real\u2014it just seems like us standing next to a cardboard cutout.\n\nJASON LYTLE WITH TWO GUNS AND O'S AND THE OCULISTS ON THUR., JUNE 11, AT THE ART THEATRE, 2025 4TH ST., LONG BEACH. 7:30 PM \/ $16-$20 \/ ALL AGES.

{"text":"CD of The Week\n\nWeek of 6\/17\/13\n\nCSS - Planta (SQE Music)\n\nTwo years after the release of their third album, La Liberaci\u00f3n, the four remaining female members of CSS (Cansei de Ser Sexy) had moved to Los Angeles to work on new music without Adriano Cintra (for the first time ever). Despite his bitter departure, they've met some new and supportive friends along the way, like Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio, who has produced their new album, Planta.\n\nLa Liberaci\u00f3n saw the band adapting to expectations from the underground dance crowds they'd often find themselves performing to, focusing on songs that would work better live in that setting. As a result, it contained mostly upbeat dance-pop tracks that could hold their own on the dance floor, but didn't seem to have much else to say depth-wise. For the most part, CSS have always seemed to prioritize simple lyrics, intense layering, catchy hooks, quirky off-balance elements, and basically just having fun with it. But with their last release, I started to feel like their often challenging and quirky punk edge was being subdued in favor of a more traditionally safe pop sound.\n\nThey've found a way to balance the best of both worlds with Planta, focusing less on stand-alone dance tracks and more on the song structure and album flow as a whole. The lyrics are pretty simple (sometimes even a tad ridiculous), but this band expresses their vocals most creatively in how they are sung and arranged, producing an infectious and strong sense of aural intrigue for the listener. There are many examples of this throughout, perhaps the most notable of which is in \"Teenage Tiger Cat,\" (written about Sitek's kitty), where Lovefoxxx sings \"I'm getting rowdy, rowdy, woo-oo-oo\/rowdy, rowdy, ROARRRR.\" This expressive lyrical bite, in addition to the other vocals, makes the song incredibly sexy, adorable, and fun. I was surprised to find out that single \"Hangover\" was co-written by Rancid's Tim Armstrong, who was interested in collaborating with them. And Gossip's Hannah Blilie plays the drums on \"Dynamite.\" There's definitely more of a punk\/ska\/reggae vibe throughout this album, particularly on tracks like \"The Hangout,\" and it's always great to hear this come through in their music. Many of the synth sequences, especially towards the end of \"Into the Sun,\" are some of the best I've heard from them and I can't get enough of it. Planta is tastefully done and I hope CSS continue to grow in this direction."}

{"text":"Following their 1998 Grammy nomination for Best Polka Album, the rhythm alchemists in the Texas dance band Brave Combo have made an album which not only celebrates their 20-year anniversary, but which brilliantly synthesizes their many influences. While previous recordings have explored variations of particular dance styles, from polka to cha-cha, embracing both traditional and appealingly off-center perspectives, The Process is a seamless pop album of tightly-crafted songs, wonderful vocal harmonies and always-surprising instrumental textures. So, listen or dance -- either way, The Process is the definitive Brave Combo album."}
{"text":"[Locals Only] Stanleylucasrevolution, 'Evolutionary Sunset Call'\n\nYou'd assume it's led by some guy named Stanley Lucas, right? But Stanley Lucas is a fictional character, afflicted with a terminal illness (the specific condition doesn't seem to be important, but it's a prominent motif in several songs). Though the artist behind stanleylucasrevolution performs live (usually as a one-man-band with backing loops), he prefers not to be named or depicted in the media, instead asking outlets to run \"abstract images representing larger causes.\" It's rock meeting conceptual art in a way not usually seen outside the Lou Reed-Laurie Anderson marriage.\n\nMore About\n\nThe music itself is more conventional than you'd believe. Evolutionary Sunset Call, the latest stanleylucasrevolution release, features such surprisingly catchy songs as the social commentary-filled \"We Still Love Them\" and \"New Stone 40.\" Sure, there's plenty of weird stuff, too, such as \"(Intro in C),\" 42 seconds of seemingly random noises in the middle of the album. \"Two Ways\" starts with the same creepy voice sample (\"What's the matter with you, thought you were asleep\") repeated several times, followed by a dramatically slowed track with overdubbed vocals.\n\nGiven the potential as a singer and songwriter shown throughout the album, the prevailing question is if all this is a distraction preventing stanleylucasrevolution from further success, or the exact thing that distinguishes the \"band\" from the myriad more accessible acts out there. Evolutionary Sunset Call might not be enough to arrive at a definitive answer, but points have to be given for originality. There are a lot of ideas at work here, both musically and aesthetically. Like any piece of conceptual art, it's more about forcing you to think in a different way than the end product. And if the end product has some good hooks, all the better."}

They create some very interesting songs at times, and I am occasionally reminded of the sounds of Oingo Boingo (though still not quite as wacky) when listening to them. This song comes off of their 2005 album, \"Plucked\". They have a lot of releases, as you can imagine (almost 33 years worth of them). So I recommend doing what I did, and checking out their 2009 compilation album, \"Essential As Anything\"."}
{"text":"Shit man, Beach House never quits. Nor do I want them to. But seriously, they're probably actually wizards or aliens. They have the gift of musical hypnotism. They've just released their first official single, \"Lazuli,\" from their upcoming album, Bloom, which is set to drop on May 15.\n\n\"Lazuli\" has a thicker than usual emphasis on synthesizers and electronic effects of the sort. Beach House has stepped up their experimentation with lush 80s influences without leaning too far towards once specific style. The vocals are dreamier than ever, sounding slightly stacked with soft, breathy layers. There is a noticeable lack in the well-known lead guitar that we've all gotten used to expecting but the song makes up for it with so many layers of keyboards and synthesizers. Make no mistake, the guitar is still there, just not as pronounced. It's easy to get carried away with so many synthesized electronics but Beach House has achieved that delicate and tasteful balance as always.\n\nBeach House really knows how to spoil their fans. so it's obvious that their newest album, Bloom, is highly anticipated. That's why you should stay tuned for some more reviews to come in the very near future!!"}

Chance of rain 60 percent.\n\nWoodbury Patch spoke with Ellsworth about his hometown, his musical career and his artistic influences.\n\nWoodbury Patch: When's the last time you played in Woodbury?\n\nDaniel Ellsworth: The last time we played in the Twin Cities was in August, but this is probably the first time we've ever played in Woodbury. We play in the Twin Cities fairly often, but we're excited to do this benefit for the art center. I grew up in Woodbury, and music was a huge part of my childhood and growing up.\n\nPatch: What are you planning on doing while you're back to Woodbury?\n\nEllsworth: Hanging out with my family; I don't get to see them all that often. Hanging out and eating some good meals.\n\nPatch: What are your musical influences?\n\nEllsworth: I can list off the big ones: The band Wilco, definitely Tom Petty, Paul Simon, Talking Heads. Those are artists that sometimes people draw comparisons to, but I'm not sure we're necesarily like them. It's more that we respect what they do as bands and artists that have made lifelong careers. They have longevity, they've lasted and will keep lasting, they're not a Top 40 radio hit.\n\nEllsworth: To have any sort of national television exposure is a good thing. It's definitely been helpful. It's pretty different from what we do as a band. We incorporate a lot of harmonies into our music, but I wouldn't say we're necessarily influenced by a capela music though it's sort of a part of what I do now.\n\nPatch: What's your song-writing process?\n\nEllsworth: It varies all the time, but sometimes I'll approach the band with a finished song or sometimes I'll come with an unfinished idea, and we flush it out as a band, and the song, the lyrics and that come in different ways.\n\nEllsworth: I wrote that in my house in Nashville. I wrote it originally on our piano. It ended up taking a lot more synth, a little bit more electronic sound. That's one where I had this skeletal outline of a song, and I brought it to the band, and through a series of writing sessions and rehearsals it changes into what it is now."}

{"text":"Interview: Slightly Stoopid\n\nI'll be the first one to say that Slightly Stoopid has never been one of my all-time favorite bands. To the untrained eye, they may appear as a generic, Southern California-bred ska\/punk\/reggae outfit. However, to make this assumption is to deal them a great injustice. To anyone who knows really just about anything about music, it becomes evident almost immediately after hearing a couple tracks that this band is a variable smorgasbord of musical talent.\n\nCiting influences in everything from rock to jazz, reggae to hip hop and punk to funk, Slightly Stoopid delivers some of the most complex, diverse and different sounds out right now. But what's the best part about it? They've been doing it with unnerving consistency for over 15 years, and have seen and done just about everything, including touring with Snoop Dogg.\n\nPhoto: L. Paul Mann\n\nSlightly Stoopid drummer Ryan \"RyMo\" Moran was kind enough to take an insane amount of time out of his busy schedule earlier this week in between the sound check at their show in Salt Lake City, Utah, to discuss everything from their current Seedless Summer Tour with Rebelution, Shwayze and Cisco Adler, to Slightly Stoopid's method for battling hangovers, to the current economic state of the music industry and its rapid progression into the digital age. Yes, it got that crazy.\n\nAnd for all you Sublime fans, RyMo was also kind enough to share a very interesting, lesser-known history of Skunk Records, how it was started, and how Slightly Stoopid is graciously fulfilling their duty of passing on the torch to younger bands via their own Stoopid Records.\nAt the end of the day, RyMo was maybe one of the most intelligent and down-to-earth people I've ever interviewed for Pop-Break. Our conversation was very casual and laid back, but it was easy to see that RyMo recognizes wholeheartedly that music is his life. That's really saying a lot, given that I'm not Slightly Stoopid's biggest fan.\n\nIn other words, enjoy \u2026\n\nPop-Break: So what is the Seedless Summer Tour?\n\nRyan Moran: The Seedless Summer Tour is us with Rebelution as main support, based out of Santa Barbara doing kind of like a reggae thing. And then we've got Shwayze also on tour with us. He's doing kind of like a pop-hip hop thing.\n\nPB: You've still got quite a hefty schedule ahead, but how has the tour been so far?\n\nRyMo: It's been really fun, man. All the guys in all the bands are super cool. Everyone's been hanging out every day and we've been barbecuing together every night. After almost every show we throw a barbecue, so everyone kind of gets a good chance to get to know each other a little bit and drink a couple beers, shoot the shit. You know? It's a lot of fun. It's kind of like a summer camp for adults.\n\nPB: You guys just played for your hometown, San Diego. From what I heard, it's always a pretty big deal for Slightly Stoopid. How was it this time around?\n\nRyMo: Yeah, we had a really big show a couple days ago -\u2013 super fun. It was great, man. We had all our friends, all our families were there. We sold around 14,000 tickets which was, I think, good for us. We were really happy with the result. The show went off without a hitch \u2014- no technical problems, no issues, no nothin', so it was definitely a win-win.\n\nPB: So, I was pretty partied out when I woke up this \"morning.\" For some reason, even though I'd only drank beer the night before (albeit a ton of it \u2026), I managed to catch a hangover. After staring at my ceiling for about 15 minutes, wondering why the Gods plagued mankind with hangovers, I figured this would be a good question: After being together for so long, Slightly Stoopid HAS to have developed its own patented hangover remedy. What is it?\n\nRyMo: Honestly, man, the only thing you can really do is just try to stay hydrated. In all seriousness, we sweat fuckin' bullets every night, so we're able to actually drink a good amount. I drink more, way more, then when I'm at home and I get a hangover here and there, but I think because we sweat so much, the key thing for us to prevent or reduce the hangover vibe is to just stay as hydrated as possible and just force yourself to pound 20 little bottles of water a day and just try not to go too far beyond your limits, you know?\n\nPB: A detail of Slightly Stoopid's music that I've always been keen about is that the band utilizes a drummer and a percussionist. Is it difficult for you to groove with a percussionist on the congas or whatever OG's using? How do you guys work together?\n\nRyMo: It's not difficult at all so long as we're on the same musical page. OG [Slightly Stoopid's percussionist] and I have known each other for a really long time and we know how to flow together, so it's all good. We both listen to each other, like he'll encourage me. He'll say, \"Oh hey, on this one song, let's try this,\" or, \"let's do this little hit together \u2013- it'll sound cool.\" Or vice versa, I'll be like, \"Yeah, let's try this,\" or, \"let's alter that,\" or, \"let's just leave this part open.\" We're always working to make our parts more cohesive and more sort of beneficial to the overall music. We try to make our parts fit as well as we can. We're always working on parts, even on songs we've been playing for years. We're always working together \u2026 and I definitely think that's important, you know?\n\nPB: One thing I believe bands have a hard time with, particularly those bands that play ska music, reggae, or even ska-punk, is keeping their music sounding original and crisp. Many feel as though the music can get somewhat redundant or even monotonous after a while. But with Slightly Stoopid, it seems like there's always something more going on; there are just so many different things going on at one time to help bring your songs together. How would you rationalize for how complex Slightly Stoopid's music really is?\n\nRyMo: I think a lot of people don't see that if they're not musicians. I think they just go, \"Oh yeah, I like this band, they're just a reggae band, and that's it.\" They don't realize that in Slightly Stoopid, we're sort of schizophrenics musically. We like punk rock, ska, hip-hop, rock, reggae, we like so many different things, like electronic style and all this other stuff. We basically bring a little bit of that into every song.\n\nAnd also, with the reggae thing, you're right \u2013- a lot of bands that play reggae just make it, you know, you're just skanking on the guitar, and playing a cool bass line and keeping a simple rhythm with the drums. And that's true, to an extent. Technically, it's not as complicated as other styles of music, but what people don't realize is that to play it well you have to be a good musician.\n\nI think a lot of people just think, \"Oh Slightly Stoopid, yeah, they just smoke pot and play reggae.\" Well, we've all done our homework. We've all listened to a lot of different stuff and honestly, within our band, you can probably spin off four or five different genres and we'd be able to pull them off. We could probably turn into a salsa band for a night, or a jazz band or an '80s cover band, because we have that much knowledge collectively. All the guys have done a lot of listening, a lot of studying and everyone basically devoted their lives to music. I think that's one of the reasons why Stoopid is able to sort of weave in and out of different genres while still getting respected [by] other musicians and stuff.\n\nPB: So then let's set the record straight right now. I've read so many articles describe you guys as just about everything under the sun \u2014 everything from reggae rock to acoustic hip hop to even ska funk and ska punk. The only genre I've really never heard anyone peg you as would probably be disco. So what would you, a member of the band, describe Slightly Stoopid's musical genre as.\n\nRyMo: I mean [laughing], that's funny, and that is a question that I get a fair amount. I would say, just in the least amount of words, it's reggae \u2014 rock-funk-punk. We do cross all those genres pretty much most of the time. We throw in some ska, we throw in other different styles like hip hop and all that stuff. But I'd say just if you wanted to generalize us in as few words as possible, I'd say those four genres sort of cover the gamut of what we do at this point.\n\nPB: If one goes to shows by bands like The Wailers, Pepper, 311, Sublime With Rome, it seems like many of the fans these shows draw are very single-track, if-it-doesn't-sound-like-Sublime-I-can't-stand-it type of listeners. But Slightly Stoopid plays such complex music. I'd go as far as describing you folks as a band that plays music for musicians \u2014- it's always so complex, but you put it in such a simple package. How do you guys bridge the gap between the \"music for musicians\" standpoint and the \"if-it-doesn't-sound-like-Sublime-I-can't-stand-it\" type of fan.\n\nRyMo: Yeah, I understand that kind of fan. That's typically a younger fan that's saying, \"If it doesn't sound like this one band \u2026\" I mean, I think as most people grow a little bit, become a little [wiser] and get a little older physically, they start getting a little more open to different styles. I grew up on Led Zeppelin and Rush, Aerosmith and Dead Kennedys and stuff. But these days, I mean, I listen to classical if I'm in that kind of mood, or I'll listen to world music, Ravi Shankar, or hip hop. Music becomes a mood at a certain point. So I'm not always in the same mood, so I'm not always going to listen to the same kind of music to reflect that mood. If I'm pissed off, I'm going to listen to some metal, straight up, or some punk rock. Or if I'm feeling cool and it's a Sunday afternoon and I'm barbecuing with my friends, I'm probably not going to put some metal on, I'm going to put some reggae on or some rock 'n' roll. You know what I'm saying?\n\nI think that the limited viewpoint of the listener is kind of their own limitation. I think what we provide is an accurate cross-section of a lot of different [types of] music that we all like to play. I mean literally, like we said, a ton of reggae, a ton of hip hop, to even straight ahead jazz, to some meaner '70s dirty funk Parliament shit. We're all looking a little bit older now. We're not 18 or 19 years old, you know? We're in our mid-30s now. We've been around and we've had some up's and down's and at this point, the music that we play reflects the broader sort of back-drum of stuff that we've had to deal with in our lives and music that we listen to as opposed to just being 18-year-old kids playing punk rock for a fifth of the world.\n\nI would just say for the listeners that if it just doesn't fit their thing, then that's fine -\u2014 we probably have at least a couple songs that they probably would still like. Maybe they wouldn't like the whole show, or maybe we would kick them out to some new shit that they'll really like, you know? A lot of the younger kids haven't checked out other stuff that's a little more obscure that's not on the mainstream wave-length.\n\nPB: I think it's safe to say that you guys have been pretty fortunate. Slightly Stoopid has played live on Jimmy Kimmel, toured with Snoop Dogg, signed to Skunk Records right out of high school \u2013- that's some pretty crazy stuff that a lot of people can only dream about. Having said that, what would you say is your all-time most memorable experience?\n\nRyMo: Let's not forget that there's a lot of blood sweat and tears invested in all that good luck. Yeah, we've had great luck, but let's not forget that the band has dedicated all of our collective lives to really doing this. A lot of bands like to go, \"oh, how did you do this, how do you do that?\" And it's like, you know what, man, we don't even know. We just worked our asses off and we were lucky that we've been able to come across the right people, but I think we came across the right people because we were working our asses off. I would just say there's really no short cut outside of hard work. No matter what you do in life, if you bust your ass, you're going to get some success at some point. It might not be as much as you want, it might not be when you want, but you will get it.\n\nI don't know, though. Just off the top of my head, there've been hundreds of those, you know? Touring with some landmark acts like the Snoops or the Dave Matthews. We did Lollapalooza this last summer and it was absolutely insane. We got to play in between Social Distortion, who was one of our favorite bands growing up. They're another band from Southern Cal that we all grew up listening to, and still do to this day. We got to play between them and Green Day, and Green Day is awesome. We never thought we'd be able to be anywhere near that type of a lineup, and here we are smack dab between two of our favorite bands.\n\nI guess the high points really for us have been to meet some of our idols and actually just throw down and hang out with some of these people that we've grown up listening to \u2014 to get the odd chance for a head nod, a hand shake or a high five. That's really what makes us all happy.\n\nPB: When I was growing up, Skunk Records really became more like a dynasty or a dream to me, you know? Can you tell me a little bit more about Slightly Stoopid's relationship with Skunk Records, what it's meant to you guys and what it was like getting signed to them so early on.\n\nRyMo: In a nutshell, Skunk Records was two people. It was Brad Nowell from Sublime, and Mike Happoldt. Mike Happoldt is still one of our producers to this day, we work with him all the time. Basically those two guys started that record label as an underground Long Beach record label. It was basically two friends who just put their heads together and said, \"Hey, we're going to start recording.\"\n\nAt the time, Mike Happoldt was called Miguel. Miguel was going to Long Beach State and he was in a recording arts music program there \u2026 and so after hours there they would sneak into Long Beach State and Sublime recorded a whole bunch of stuff there. They would basically just sneak in after hours and use the studio from like, 8 p.m. 'till 4 in the morning and then come back in the next night and do it all again. Skunk Records really was just a grass roots movement between those two guys.\n\nNow sadly, we all know the story that Brad Nowell passed away in '96 from an overdose on heroin, which sucked. At that point Mike, or Miguel, basically kept the label going, but it shrunk considerably. It went from like a full-on functioning label to just basically him doing stuff out of his house on a smaller scale. Basically, Skunk Records released quite a few records from bands like The Ziggens, one of Sublimes favorite bands from back in the day. They released a good amount of other stuff \u2014- obviously the work they did with Long Beach Dub [Allstars]. Basically, Skunk Records is just Miguel Happoldt. It's his project.\n\nWe still work with him, and now we have our own thing, Stoopid Records. We're putting our own stuff on our own imprint now, and that seems to be working really well. But we basically modeled it in a certain way after \u2026 Skunk [Records] -\u2014 goin' just grass roots, small-scale, keeping it kind of in-house. And now we're doing the same thing. We're basically passing that torch on to the younger bands, like Sublime gave some bands a chance in the mid-'90s, and now we're able to give some of these bands a chance to record some music 20 years later. Now, we're the older guys and the younger guys are coming up and they need support, so we're able to kind of show them the ropes because we've been on the road for so long and have been doing this for a while now.\n\nPB: A lot of bands release music under their own imprints so they don't have their arms twisted behind their backs by labels.\n\nRyMo: At the end of the day, a record label is a business. There used to be this myth, and I'm sure you've heard it, that says you sign a record deal and then you retire. You make a million dollars and you've made it. And then you never have to lift a finger again, you never have to work again, and that is like the biggest bunch of bullshit ever.\n\nI don't know how that myth was propelled, but basically record labels offer a lump sum of money. It's almost like taking a loan out for a house. They're loaning you money to create a product that, if they don't like, they don't have to release, they can change your band name, they can change everything really. And these decisions are made by guys in Hollywood high-rises. These aren't decisions made by the band or the bands management, even. We're talking about decisions that have everything to do with the band that the band has no say in. A lot of people don't realize that when you sign to a record label, you're giving up anywhere between a little bit of your creative control and you're whole creative control. You can get fucked really easily.\n\nLet's say you sign to a major label and the flavor of the moment is Linkin Park and Papa Roach and P.O.D. But you have to make your music sound like that even though you might sound more like Metallica, or you might sound more like NOFX or someone that's a little more edgy or punkier. They'll say, \"No, that's not in right now, so we're going to slow all your tempo's down, [and] we're going to change all your song lyrics to make them catchier.\" So that's what people don't realize a lot of time: You basically have to sacrifice a whole bunch of stuff creatively to get your point across and get that record deal.\n\nPhoto: Eric Krebs\n\nThese days , especially with the internet and file sharing being a lot more readily accessible, there are a lot of people saying, \"Screw that, man. We don't need to go that way. We're just going to record this music, put it on the internet, and hope people come to our live shows,\" because that's how the way the musicians get paid.\n\nMost people think that every CD you sell, the money goes straight to the artist. Well, in actuality, usually, in the best case scenario, the artist might make one dollar off a CD you might buy in a store for $15, you know what I mean? You have to sell a hell of a lot of CDs before you start seeing coin, and you have to recoup that money the record label put forward.\n\nI'd probably have to sell at least 100,000, maybe 200,000, copies of the CD before I even see one cent. That's a hard thing to do. So yeah, when people say that when you sign to a big record label you've made it [and] you never have to do anything ever again, that's actually usually where all the work begins. So a record label might get you in the public eye and everything, but you still have to work to pay off that loan.\n\nWith us, and with a lot of bands these days, you can make a quality recording on an in-house budget for considerably less [than to record with a major label] and it will still be a high quality product.\n\nPB: And you don't have to sell your soul\u2026\n\nPB: Exactly! And you're keeping all the profits from each sale. So instead of making 50 cents to a dollar per disc, now you're making like seven dollars a disc, after expenses, you know? If it costs three or four dollars to make each copy and you sell them for 10 bucks, you're making six or seven bucks per unit. And then that money goes right back into the pot and once you sell 5,000 units, you've recouped $30,000 versus having to sell a million records just to break even.\n\nPB: So would you say big labels are just out to fuck artists?\n\nRyMo: Well, let's not say they just want to fuck you, because then they wouldn't be in business. Because at the end of the day it's a business and they're trying to make money. Basically, what they're doing is hedging a bet. They say, \"Alright, I'm going to bet on Slightly Stoopid. I'm going to bet they put out a real quality product for $100,000. Now, once we put that hundred grand up, then they owe us, right? Then we have them by the balls. Now, they're going to go on tour and do all this stuff to support the record and we're going to put more money in to make it like a press thing and a big publicity stunt.\" At the end of the day, it's not that they're trying to fuck you. It's that if you're not successful, you're going to get dropped. But if they're making money off of you\u2026\n\nLet's say you go huge and turn into Aerosmith and every album sells 10 million copies. Guess who's the darling of the label and gets whatever they want?\n\nSo that's the gamble that that a lot of bands are willing to take, or maybe more so 10 or 20 years ago. But that's the trade-off: It's not like every label is just going, \"Oh, we're going to fuck all these bands.\" The labels need the bands as much as the bands need the labels. But now, with the advent of technology, the Internet, and all these new ways to put music out, now the labels aren't as necessary because anyone can record a CD in their own house, put it up for sale on a website, and generate some income. And if you're touring, you can do that tenfold. At the end of the day, the labels are trying to make money. And if you're not making them money, you're out.\n\nThis is all interesting to me because we're watching this whole industry shift. Just look at [how] Blockbuster went out of business. We've got Borders book stores going under now. We're seeing a shift in the way media is transferred, and that's happening really, really quickly. The internet has revolutionized countless industries.\n\nPB: So, from what I'm gathering, we can conclude that you're a big advocate of the internet marketplace?\n\nRyMo: Of course! See, the thing is, a band like [Slightly Stoopid], we thrive from that. We never sold a million records. We didn't go huge and now the Internet is killing our sales. We were the other way around. We were just a touring band and we were able to spread our buzz and our word of mouth and generate some sales from the Internet. We didn't shy away from it in a way that certain other bands are really anti-internet and anti-file sharing. You can't stop that now \u2014- look at Youtube. You can't stop YouTube, it's huge!\n\nPB: There's really no smooth transition to this next question, so I'll just move right into it. You guys are playing in Asbury Park, N.J., on August 10. It definitely won't be your first time here. What kind of crowd are you expecting and how do you like New Jersey?\n\nPB: Yeah, we've done PNC [Bank Arts Center], we've played Asbury Park probably five or six times now the Stone Pony and the outside stage. It's great. It's one of our favorite venues because it's right on the beach, you know? We can go across the street, go for a swim, walk around, and check out all the shops. It's always a lot of fun to be there, for sure.\n\nPB: Alright, well my last question is something I ask to everybody. You absolutely must answer. I read somewhere that you were a Guinness man. If you were stuck on an island or were on death row and you could only drink one more beer for the rest of your life, what would it be?\n\nRyMo: I mean, you just said it. I'd probably be happy with some Guinness, man. I wouldn't even need to eat that much food because I'd be drinking a lot of that shit. Yeah, I like that beer \u2014 it's one of my favorites.\n\nResponses\n\nAfter reading this interview, I can't help but be absolutely thrilled to be seeing them a week from this Friday. Not only are these guys humble from the times I've met them, but they keep me coming back for more. Literally though, this is going to be the fourth time I've seen them in six months! And hell yeah to those post-show BBQs, these guys are down to earth AND down to rage!!\n\n[...] on the road for the 2012 Unity Tour with Slightly Stoopid and 311. I was fortunate enough to have interviewed RyMo of Slightly Stoopid a year or so back and he seems like a great dude. How are you guys diggin' the tour thus [...]"}

{"text":"Blue Cheer can lay a pretty legitimate claim to siring, via Mudhoney and Queens of the Stone Age, both grunge and stoner rock, so when they returned to the studio in 2007 to record WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU it was as elder statesmen and the originators of ideas that spawned big business. Not bad for a bunch of former recreational drug-indulgers with loud riffs and a wah pedal. The youthful energy that made VINCEBUS ERUPTUM such a masterpiece has evolved into technical mastery here, and with modern production values the band's trademark distortion sounds like deep stoner ear candy. The material isn't the strongest the band has ever worked with, but the Cheer has always been a bad blues cover band at heart and songwriting was never a forte. Volume and audacity were, however, and WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU delivers plenty of both."}
{"text":"Wooden Teeth\n\n(Lujo; US: 6 Nov 2007; UK: Available as import)\n\nMouse Fire: Wooden Teeth\n\nWooden Teeth is one of those frustrating albums whose individual constituents there is nothing discernibly wrong with, but the sum of which remains elusively unsatisfying. Cuts like \"Feel Good Drag\" showcase decent melodies and an impressively tight rhythm section, but disappointingly Mouse Fire fail to expand on these to incorporate them into anything truly memorably. Every positive is followed by a negative; the aforementioned highlight's dueling guitar and keys slide into Joey Bruce's wearied vocals, while the pendulous groove of \"Comes Around Goes Around\" never fulfills the potential of its overtures. Though Bruce's serene purr does find a fitting environment on \"The Unknown\" and \"To Celebrate a Suicide\", such offerings, while pleasant, are ultimately transient. At fault, perhaps, is not just the band\u2014\"Started a Fire\" is good enough to be a lost Minus the Bear track, but while in the latter's hands it would most likely be both boisterous and captivating, Wooden Teeth's production, added to the lack of electronic sheen, leaves it sounding hazy. As does, in fact, most of the album\u2014the press release says \"dance rock\", but in truth you can't imagine anyone either dancing or rocking out to this. Great name, though."}
{"text":"About this album\n\nAdore is the fourth studio album by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins. Virgin Records released the album on June 2, 1998 in the United States. Adore is the Pumpkins' only album not to feature original drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Adore marked a change in sound for The Smashing Pumpkins; Greg Kot of Rolling Stone magazine noted that the album \"isn't just a transitional record; it's a complete break with the past.\" Their previously layered, guitar-oriented sound was largely replaced by a quieter and more electronic influenced sound, and incorporated drum machines and synthesizers.\nFor the release, the band shed their alternative hipster image for a more subdued Gothic look. Billy admitted in his blog to taking \"copius quantites of ecstasy\" when beginning writing demoes for the album at his home after the Mellon Collie tour.\n\nDespite being called \"one of the most anticipated albums of 1998\" by MTV, Adore sold only 1.1 million copies in the U.S., far below the Pumpkins' previous albums Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. However, the album was well received by critics, and became the third straight Pumpkins album to be nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance. Billy Corgan would later characterize the album as \"a band falling apart.\"\n\nIt's becoming my favourite.... I can understand but cannot accept this had a cold reception by the time it was released... Every single song is so brilliant...Behold! The Night Mare, Daphne Descends, Blank Page, For Martha... Just brilliant.\n\ni think i'm rediscovering the calm of adore... what a smooth & poetic LP... so altruistic! guess i take back what i said about it being overrated among SP fans... i've seen it in a revitalised light; rather it's like their unsung symphony :)\n\nI don't understand all the hype this gets. Machina is far superior IMO. To me, even Gish tops this, dare I say, at times, bore fest. Don't get me wrong though, it has its moments and is better played as a whole... but the following album which is often written off in favour of Adore, were even double-disc! More quantity AND quality! xP"}

{"text":"Cousin Brian's First is a summer record, but don't let that deter you. With the advent of chillwave and the convergence of surf rock and dream pop, \"good for the summer\" is just as often a compliment as it is a critical euphemism for \"dull as dirt.\" First is far from dull as dirt. It's quite fun, actually, a rapid-heartbeat collection of jittery guitar jangles from the neighborhood geeks. There's a nervous energy on this record that becomes infectious; no song lasts much longer than two minutes, but they all have pop structures, which means a lot of information gets condensed into a small amount of space. The album is a frenetic whirlwind of ideas, and each one is given just enough time to lodge itself into your skull before the next one takes over. Yes, these songs are catchy. All the instruments are playing hooks all the time, and it's up to you to figure out which one you want to focus on, whether it be the grody bass popping constantly with the ever-bouncing drums, the dexterous guitar lines outlining high-pitched chords, or the vocals sneering over everything in a sarcastic whine. Currently, I'm focused on the oo-oohs that come so frantically and frequently you'd think Cousin Brian were meeting a quota. At any rate, First is an album begging for repeated listens in order to discover the myriad of layers that make it tick.\n\nAnd this thing ticks anxiously, like the last band practice before a big gig. That's what gives it charm. Cousin Brian have the songwriting chops and the talent, but they also have an earnestness about them. The brevity and geek-punk chic of First makes it sound like it was thrown together haphazardly, but Cousin Brian's tightness and the intricate musicianship of the record indicate that the record is well thought out. In short, it manages to be awesome without sounding like it's trying too hard. It's a bit left field - the surreal, grotesque barbecue depicted on the album cover is a good visual representation of the album's sound - and that only serves to help it stand out. First is an awesome rock record that wastes no time not being awesome"}
{"text":"Madison Violet Interview\n\nMadison Violet Interview\n\nAcclaimed Canadian roots duo Madison Violet are thrilled to announce their return to Australia, taking in dates across New South Wales and Victoria this February and March, including a run of shows at the Port Fairy Folk Festival on the Victorian coast. With their fourth studio album 'The Good In Goodbye' released recently in Australia via MGM, the pair is primed to win over East Coast audiences with their melodic folk-roots infusion and sweet harmonies.\n\n'The Good In Goodbye', an 11-song collection penned entirely by Madison Violet's Brenley MacEachern and Lisa MacIsaac, is an open diary that explores the pair's upbringing, life on the road and overarching friendship. With renowned producer and friend Les Cooper at the helm, Madison Violet have crafted a sweeping record that invokes the essence of Lucinda Williams or Steve Earle, brimming with bittersweet sentiment but anchored in a place of contentment and peace.\n\nHaving toured internationally with artists like Ron Sexsmith, Indigo Girls and The Temptations, along with a current sold-out headline tour through Europe and the UK that is garnering rave reviews, Madison Violet will look to continue their success here in Australia. The duo has chalked up numerous industry accolades including a 2009 Canadian Folk Music Award for Vocal Group of the Year, 2010 Juno nomination for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year, and last year became the first Canadian act to win the prestigious international John Lennon Songwriting Contest. 'The Good In Goodbye' is one of the nominees for Album Of The Year at the forthcoming Canadian East Coast Music Awards in April.\n\nMadison Violet will kick off their Australian East Coast tour on February 22 at The Brass Monkey in Sydney's Sutherland Shire. Don't miss your chance to catch a one-off performance from this lauded duo while they're on Australian shores!\n\nInterview with Brenley MacEachern and Lisa MacIsaac\n\nQuestion: How would you describe The Good in Goodbye?\n\nLisa MacIsaac: Well, it's been described by others as an 'open diary' of our lives these past few years, and I have to say I agree with them. Brenley and I experienced a lot of changes in our lives, socially, and this album was the recipient of all the blood, sweat and tears that came of that change. The title sums up what we were feeling when we were writing it, in that we needed to find the good in goodbye. And thankfully, we did.\n\nQuestion: Did you have any pre-conceived ideas about the music industry?\n\nLisa MacIsaac: Hunter S. Thompson summed it up when he said \"The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free, and good men die like dogs. There's also a negative side.\"\n\nQuestion: Do you write your own songs? What's your inspiration?\n\nBrenley MacEachern: Yes we write all of our own songs. Books, movies, people on the subway inspire us to write but mostly it comes from all the conversations we have in our heads that end up in the songs.\n\nQuestion: What music\/artists do you listen to when you are not playing your own?\n\nBrenley MacEachern: Right now I'm listening to the new Bahamas record and really liking it a lot. I recently bought The Head and The Heart and the new Elliot Brood record as well. Generally though, I don't listen to music a lot these days unless I'm off the road for a few weeks in a row which is seldom.\n\nQuestion: Was there a moment you contemplated throwing in the towel?\n\nLisa MacIsaac: Was there, or how many? I think every artist has good days and bad, where they wonder why they do what they do. As long as you can see the light at the end of the tunnel or at least a spotlight from the ceiling, you can get through it. Knowing that your music has helped some people through rough times enables you to go on doing what you do.\n\nQuestion: Do you prefer performing live or recording?\n\nLisa MacIsaac: Definitely performing live. There's no real instant gratification in the studio. It can be tedious. It can be stressful. And there are no fans clapping along, even when you cock something up. Performing live is why we do it.\n\nQuestion: What\/who was your inspiration to go into the music industry?\n\nBrenley MacEachern: I'm not sure but If I find out, I'm gonna give them a good slap.\n\nQuestion: What is the biggest challenge you have faced along the way to your musical success?\n\nBrenley MacEachern: Learning how to stay in the moment and be happy for what you have.\n\nQuestion: What's a typical day like?\n\nLisa MacIsaac: On the road? Well, we get up early. Pack the van. Tour manager drives us many hours to the next city while we sleep. Soundcheck. Gig. Eat late night schwarma. Sleep. Repeat. Sometimes we have time to do a little walking around the city between soundcheck and the show, but honestly, it's typically go go go.\n\nQuestion: If you could collaborate with another artist, who would it be?\n\nBrenley MacEachern: I think I have a different answer every time I'm asked that question. Depends on my mood I guess. Today I'd say Paul Simon\n\nQuestion: Can you tell us 5 things required for a happy healthy & enjoyable life?\n\nBrenley MacEachern: 1. Surround yourself with good, positive happy people. 2. Laugh a lot. Smile a lot. 3. Be good to yourself so that you can be good to other people. 4. Play something - whether it be a game or a sport or an instrument. Just play something everyday. 5. Be selfless\n\nQuestion: What is the story behind the bands name?\n\nBrenley MacEachern: Violet is the name of an extraterrestrial we met at a hot springs in New Mexico. At least we think she is."}

How cool would that be.\n\n'Since no one has ever heard of it, maybe a description would be more helpful than a grade?'\n\nWell, I could give you my review, but I haven't written it yet. It's Weeknd-esque music but more produced--almost like slow clips from My Beautiful, Dark, Twisted Fantasy--overdubbed with an Auto-tuned woman's voice. Drums build up (solo style), rim shots take over, bass kicks in, etc. I think the drumming could be the most interesting part of the act, but the vocal melodies can be inspired, too. If you like chill out music, or, like me, you want to hear everything 2012 has to offer, check it out on Spotify\/YouTube. I think it's too good musically\/production\u200b-wise, to be an HM, and nowhere near good enough to be an A minus; B+ concluded. It's better than anything The Weeknd brought out, IMO.\n\nYour post was blocked, because it appears similar to spam or automated messages. If this is not the case, revise your post and try again.\n\nI don't know about Jonathan Lethem. He writes about a lot of things I don't care about (science fiction, comic books, his college pals, Drew Barrymore, how hurt he was when James Wood didn't like his novel) and I find I care even less about them after I've read him. When he does get around to something I'm interested in (music mostly, but also Norman Mailer and Rushmore art) the wise-and-eager-gradu\u200bate-student tone drives me up the wall. Self-indulgent, I guess.\n\nAllen B., keen observations re Allo Darlin', and helps explain why it still sounds much more like the Go-Betweens than a Grant McLennan solo album.\n\nRichard C., the \"surf magazines\" reference in that song is yet more evidence that the G-B's influence is there and intentional. She\/they are also adhering to 10 songs per album, another G-B's tradition.\n\nI'm also a fan of Metalocalypse, and the new season actually started last night. Has anyone seen Dethklok live? Coincidentally, I stumbled into some trivia on the web today explaining that Toki Wartooth is based on Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt.\n\nThanks for the info on Motorpsycho. Twenty years ago I made a purchase in a local indie record store, and was given a promotional Motorpsycho cassingle (might it have been that first New Bomb Turks record that I bought that day?), but it didn't make much of an impression on me. I'd seen their name a few times since then, but had no idea that they had built such a legacy.\n\nJapandroids' 2012 album Celebration Rock is much better than Japandroids' 2009 album Post-Nothing insofar as shouting over loud guitar is much better than whining alongside loud guitar. I recommend it!\n\nI saw the Magnetic Fields in D.C. a few weeks ago. Merritt hates performing live, or so he tells interviewers, and the evidence that night confirmed this. He sighed visibly several times during the show, and halfway through kicked over the music stand with notebook that he was using for occasional help with the lyrics - poor lighting on the notebook apparently brought out his frustration. Claudia then asked him if he was \"going off book\" - the music stand and notebook lay on the middle of the stage until the encore. I have to say though that Merritt's a professional regardless, which is what bugged him about not being able to read his cheat sheets. He gave his best, as did the rest of the band.\n\nPeter G - Merritt's definitely a professional. Second time I saw them (2002 or so) he was recovering from food poisoning and looked terrible but played, sang and joked brilliantly. He made a great joke the first time I saw them, early 2001, just after the prolonged vote count. Claudia was talking about Florida, and Stephin asked the audience, \"Do you even know where Florida is? Oh, now everyone knows where Florida is. It's in Chad.\"\n\nBob, I hear you. I'm also one side into rethinking whether Ingredients in a Recipe for Soul might be Ray Charles' best album. It's kind of all here like the title says, all the different musical pieces that make up the Ray Charles thing on one 30 minute record.\n\n\"Langford's more militant and cerebral, but he's not long on professions of hope either. For both these artists, hope is too squishy -- a by-product of soft-headedness that'll let you down in the end. Laughter makes you happy with fewer compromises and complications. In a world where the big war hasn't gone our way for decades now, it's something to rely on"}
{"text":"the AU interview: That 1 Guy (USA)\n\nAre you excited to be heading back out to Australia? You've been here a few times before.\n\nYeah, looking forward to it. This will probably be my 5th or 6th, actually more then that, it's more like my 7th or 8th trip out there. I tour so much it's just one big blur to me, but it's one of my favourite places to play.\n\nFor those who haven't seen you play, you play a rather interesting instrument. It kinda looks like a science experiment that has gone wrong. What made you sit back and just decide to create something like that?\n\nIt's something that's been evolving for quite a while, very slowly, organically I guess you could day. Because I started as a double bass player and my one man band, That One Guy, it started as an acoustic thing initially. I was playing on the double bass and was banging on the body of the instrument like a drum set, sort of functioning as a one man rhythm section and the magic pipe was this, sort of solution to a problem. The problem was me figuring out how I could make those sounds I was going to make with the one instrument, it was just a way for me to be a one man orchestra, a one man rhythm section, a one man rock band, all those things and it's happened very organically. It wasn't something I really thought about ahead of time, something that's been coming together very slowly piece by piece and it's still being worked on. It's a work in progress I guess you could say.\n\nYour new album Packs A Wallop was recorded with the famous Billy Hume. How was that experience?\n\nIt was amazing, Billy and I really clicked. Mixing all types of music like southern hip-hop, Lil' John and I guess you could call it the krunk music the kids are going crazy for these days. I just really loved the sound he was getting with the low end and the bass, that's a big part of what I do the bass and the low end. It's really important to me and bass is a big part of my background, the way I think about music. Yeah it was just fun, we just clicked and the end result I couldn't be happier with, I just loved what he did with it.\n\nYour music takes the best from so many styles like jazz, rock and progressive. What inspires you, what makes you sit back and think \"I could use that idea and make it really great\"?\n\nI really listen to vibes and shapes of sound, I know it sounds weird but when something makes you feel or inspires a reaction, when something grabs you or move you in any way, that's the stuff I respond to, that's the stuff I like. Ever since I was a kid music made me laugh, made me kinda be afraid or made me want to dance or move, that's the sort of stuff that got to me, and that's what I'm looking to do in my music. It's sort of that age old debate whether humour belongs in music; what's a joke, what's serious what's for fun? To me there's no separation for any of that stuff, it's all one of the same. I just think music is meant to make you feel good and to me feeling good is laughing, it's also crying, it's all of those things. I really want my music to contain all those elements and for me, the stuff that inspires me is stuff that takes me on a journey, makes me feel all of these emotions and makes me kinda be a human basically. It's the stuff that I like and I've got a big list of that stuff if you want to hear it.\n\nAs you said before you are constantly on the road, sometimes playing over 200 shows a year. So what keeps you sane while you're traveling all across the globe?\n\nYou know the funnies thing, for the longest time touring kept me sane. I actually felt most at home when I was on the road. I know it sounds crazy but I sorta fall into this very routined life, where it is an insane schedule but it's remarkably consistent. I've got to get up, I've got to travel a bunch, I get to the gig at a certain time, I load in, I eat dinner around the same time every day, I play and I try to put all of my energy into the show. I play really long shows, I tend to play for many hours sometimes, it depends on the night, especially here in the States, I play really long sets because I usually don't have anybody opening for me I just usually play my own show, so I'll do two or three hours. It's such a mental workout and a physical workout I just feel great afterwards, I sleep really well on the road because I'm always exhausted and always moving. The funniest thing is when I come off the road, thats when I'd start to go crazy, I don't know what to do with myself. Actually that's when it can be the most stressful times for any artist because you actually have to make real decisions and maybe think about what you're going to work on. You kinda have to go to work in a sense mentally speaking. I think the road is much more of a physical work, and to me physical work is easy, you just do it and it feels very satisfying, where mental work is the stuff that is really challenging for me. I'm kind of the opposite these days, I've been going crazy when I'm at home. I've been staying in Vegas this summer and I've really enjoyed being here, so it was a fun summer off for me. I had a bunch of festivals I played here but mostly I stuck around and just had some fun.\n\nWhat is your favourite That One Guy song? Which one means the most to you?\n\nThat's a good question, I haven't thought about that in a long time. There's a couple of things on the new record I really like to play. There's this song called \"Stones Throw\" which is a modern, new age classical piece of music and I really like playing that live because I can improvise and it sounds like a whole orchestra and mostly because it's new and fresh it just feels good to play. There's another new song off the record called \"Modern Man\" which has been fun to play just because it's has a different feel, it's just very powerful to play it's got a big sound, very sonically dense. Those two have been super fun to play. There's this other new song off the new album called \"Step Into Striped Light\" I get to play this almost distorted guitar solo with my bow on it and I'm playing the drums on my feet at the same time. It's actually really hard to do and I have just been enjoying the challenge of playing that every night, and every night it's always different, there is always a different solo and I'm always taking it in a different direction slights. The new stuff has been really fun for me to play, but I love playing the old stuff too. There's this old song off my first album called \"One\" and that was sort of this self declaration of me being on my own after I stopped playing with my band. It was me saying \"this is what I'm going to do\", sort of my announcement to the world even though at that point no one was listening to me at all. It just felt good to play that song, it felt like me screaming out into the wind \"I'm alone and I'm just going to do my best\". It still feels good to play that song live because I still try to hold onto that vibe.\n\nAs we said you've been touring the world and you have played hundreds of festivals and shows. Any one particular festival or band you have played with that sticks out as one of your favourites?\n\nYou know what's amazing is one of the best festivals in the world is in Australia, and that's Woodford Folk Festival. I've done that one four years in a row, I didn't do it last year but the four years before that. It was always good and every year that I played it, it was better then the last year and the last year I played it, it was the best time I ever had playing music. Mostly just the way the crowd was responding. They put me as the headliner in the big amphitheater on the last night and I got to play to 15,000 people and it was just so magical because everyone felt familiar with what I was doing and it just felt super, super special. A big light show and big sound, it was just rare, it's so nice to get to have that kind of experience. It was one of those gigs where I walked away from it where I thought \"wow if I never get to do that again at least I got to experience that\" it was that special. That has been a fun one but there's lots of really good ones. I like doing really small shows too, I like when everyone is real close to me when I'm playing and they can see what I'm doing, that feels really good to. It feels almost more intense in a sense.\n\nDo you have any advice for bands to get noticed? Things to look out for when getting their stuff out there?\n\nYeah this is something I keep learning over and over again. Just play for yourself, if you're playing for yourself and you're into what you're doing other people will notice, it will turn their heads. If you try to hard to get noticed then they'll notice you are just trying to get noticed. I think really you have to play for yourself and make yourself happy and really be into what you're doing, just really down with your trip and just down with what you're doing. That's all that matters, if you're a big fan of your own music other people will be to. If they're not you don't need then anyways, the world needs more honest music. It just needs more people really into what they're doing, that means it's special."}

{"text":"hard to believe that it's already been two years since Zebra & Giraffe released 'The Inside'. It's even harder to believe that it's been four years since the band recorded their hugely successful, SAMA award-winning album 'Collected Memories'. A lot has changed since then. Members have come and gone and the band's sound has moved from straight-up, radio-hit rock to a place far darker and more daring than even they could have imagined. Zebra & Giraffe's latest album, 'The Wisest Ones', is the result. \"We know some of the songs from this album won't be played on radio, and to a certain degree with 'Collected Memories' and 'The Inside', I always worried about a song's commercial appeal,\" says front man and lyricist, Greg Carlin. \"With 'The Wisest Ones' we really just wrote songs that felt right - songs that almost needed to get out. Whether they had a catchy chorus, or a chorus at all didn't really matter. \"That's not to say there isn't a lot of catchy stuff on this album; there is. We just haven't been afraid to experiment with our sound and push ourselves with this album. It still sounds like us; like Zebra & Giraffe; but it's definitely darker, noisier, and lyrically, a lot more honest.\" With Deftones, Nine Inch Nails, Nirvana, A Perfect Circle and Marilyn Manson having a significant influence on the mood of the album, The Wisest Ones showcases Zebra & Giraffe's desire to experiment while continuing to solidify their roots as one of South Africa's most prominent alternative-rock groups. Which is exactly why the band connected with US-based mix engineer, Mark Needham, who has worked with both seasoned performers, such as Chris Isaak, as well as up-and-coming artists."}

It opens with broken piano chords (arpeggios), until a sustained chord is played, followed by fuzzy guitar which leads into the main part of the song. The song moves at a fairly fast tempo, with the intro playing at 147 bpm, before increasing to 153 bpm. Interestingly, the intro is played a lot faster live, while the rest of the song is generally played slower. Even more interestingly, both parts of the song have decreased in speed over time.\n\nBellamy's vocal range spans from F\u266f3 to E5. The outro features sampled vocals.\n\nAdditional information\n\nNew Born began life as a piece played in sound check on the 1999 tour, while supporting the Foo Fighters, and the piano intro was written afterwards.[2] During the recording of the album in the David Bottrill sessions, the band experimented with using Bellamy's voice for the intro in place of a piano, but decided that this was too abstract and removed it post-recording.[2] Bellamy attributed this to things sounding better when experiencing the effect of magic mushrooms, which Muse were using during said recording sessions.[2]\n\nOn the single the ending (using sampled vocals) fades out gently, unlike the version found on the album Origin of Symmetry.\n\nLyricsHopeless time to roam\nThe distance to your home\nFades away to nowhere\nHow much are you worth?\nYou can't come down to earth\nYou're swelling up\nYou're unstoppable\n'Cause you've seen, seen\nToo much\nToo young, young\nSoulless is everywhere\nDestroy the spineless\nShow me it's real\nWasting our last chance to come away\nJust break the silence\n'cause I'm drifting away\nAway from you\nLink it to the world\nLink it to yourself\nStretch it like it's a birth squeeze\nAnd the love for what you hide\nAnd the bitterness inside\nIs growing like the new born\nWhen you've seen, seen\nToo much,\nToo young, young\nSoulless is everywhere\nDestroy the spineless\nShow me it's real\nWasting our last chance\nTo come away\nJust break the silence\n'Cause I'm drifting away\nAway from you\n\nOakenfold Perfect RemixLink it to the world\nLink it to yourself\nStretch it like a birth squeeze\nThe love for what you hide\nThe bitterness inside\nIs growing like the new born\nWhen you've seen, seen\nToo much,\nWhen you've seen, seen\nToo much,\nToo young, young\nSoulless is everywhere"}

Darlings have been slowly turning heads in Brooklyn for a while, playing shows at packed loft parties and getting a good deal of hype from Brooklyn based blogs. I only mention Brooklyn because, well, Darlings are a very local band, in the best way possible, and the new video for \"Teenage Girl,\" composed of footage Darling Joe Tirabassi shot at a Fourth of July party in Williamsburg, firmly implants that notion. At the same time, \"Teenage Girl,\" which references Sticky Fingers and Rubber Soul, is the sort of jangly pop song that has no regional identity. If anything, its what happens when kids raised on the Beatles, the Stones and the Kinks start to make their own tunes. Only these kids were also raised on Is This It? A bit shambolic, both the song and the video have that Zack Morris just hit the Pause button and the world has stopped feel. Incidentally, Darlings were named one of SPIN's 25 Must-Hear Artists from the CMJ Festival and are playing a bunch of shows around on their NYC turf this week.

{"text":"Sunday, April 22, 2007\n\nOK, I should probably start by being honest and admit that I managed to get slightly lost in Glasgow's one-way system driving over, so we only caught the last three songs of The Twang's set. Maybe it's being the other side of thirty now, but I have reached the stage where just because a band have made it onto the cover of the NME does not mean I assume any longer that they must be any good. However, the three songs I heard I liked. They seem to know how to work a crowd, who were into proceedings, and that's no mean feat for a crowd, many of whom could have been almost twice The Twnag's age. The soon to be Mrs. 17 seconds described them as being like a slowed down acid house, though they are definitely a rock band.\n\nWhen James come on, and kick straight into Come Home, it isn't that it's like they've never been away, but we're reminded why we fell for them all those years ago. All the memories come back: the James' t-shirts with flowers on them (note to younger readers; there was a time when bands like James and their contemporaries were known as T-shirt bands because they seemed to sell more T-shirts than records). Tim Booth has shaved his head but before I managed to have my view shut out by folk way taller than I, he has lost none of his charisma.\n\nThe band have a new greatest hits coming out shortly, but the sheer magic of the back catalogue was not forgotten last night in Glasgow. 'Sit Down' may have seemed almost like an albatross around their necks at one point - just as Radiohead found with 'Creep' a couple of years but they have so many other amazing songs. They never reached the commercial heights of U2 - though I seem to recall them playing a headline gig at Alton Towers amusement Park in England, circa the Seven album in 1992 - but their anthems certainly matched them. Some songs get gentle reworking, like the gentle lullaby version of 'She's A Star' which is stripped of it's swagger but not it's aching beautiful sadness. Even the non-single tracks that get aired, like Gold Mother can bring the mostly over thirties shuffling around the baking hot Academy.\n\nComeback tours can feel like shameless exercises in nostalgia to pay half a dozen people's mortgages. This was not one of those nights. The passion remains, the joy returns and the warmth lingers. And Tim Booth can still do the falsetto on 'Laid.' Come and sing your heart out.

{"text":"Dusted Reviews\n\nTrapist's first two albums were all about the merging of forms and genres. Sometimes percussionist Martin Brandlmayr, guitarist Martin Siewert and double bassist Joe Williamson sounded like improvisers who wanted to play songs; other times, they used their improvisations as platforms for electronic exploration accomplished in post-production. Either way, free music was their common ground.\n\nThe Golden Years is their first record in eight years, and rather than further reconnoitering and defining their territory, they're using it as a given. The task now is to do something with the sound they've developed, and this brings them further into the arms of song. Which isn't to say that they're standing up and singing; their music remains completely instrumental. But they're using essentials like tunes and beats to tell a story.\n\nThe album cover, with its yellow-tinted images of old campgrounds, clues you to the album's theme of memory, and the opening chords of \"The Gun That's Hanging In The Kitchen Wall\" have a suspended, dreamy quality, but they're both red herrings that set you up for something more warm and fuzzy than what The Golden Years delivers. Mellow strumming gives way to immaculately joined layers of fractious drumming and squelchy electronic tones, which in turn yields to a melancholy but hummable stroll. Think about the past and you're liable to remember something not so rosy.\n\nFlip the record over and there's a tune called \"Pisa.\" The town may be fixed in the minds of millions as a novelty or a tourist trap, and Siewert's lazy plucking over a repeating synth tone is congruent with post-vacation reverie. But Williamson and Brandlmayr each hack away at the tune like woodworkers determined to get that paint stripped away before lunchtime, chopping and scraping before finally falling in line with the guitarist's fading figures. Did someone go through a bout of food poisoning or get their passport stolen? Whatever the trouble, it's well conveyed by the music's carefully deployed elements of unrest. Trapist isn't experimenting anymore; the trio is using the tools they know best to subvert nostalgia and keep you ill at ease."}
{"text":"Reciprocator\n\nSomebody did Jake Sunding wrong, pierced his heart with a suicide stiletto, and herein are the lessons, rants and grousing of 10 years of picking up the pieces. Sure, we have enough broken human records to keep distilleries open for a thousand years, why another? The Sunday Show combines a clever ear with a penchant for effective borrowing. He doesn't have the strongest voice (what heartbroken rockers outside of the Buckleys do?), so the production has to work harder to get heard beyond the last barstool. Influences from '90s alternative to a more classic-leaning rock appear in the pairing of \"Angeline\" and \"Fade Away,\" mid-album highlights. \"Fade Away\"'s tightly compressed guitar blends with the boomy vocal for a haunting effect, a bedroom studio masterpiece. \"If the Axe Falls in My Sleep\" starts with a quirky Gene Ween\/Tiny Tim staccato and bridges with a brief Morrison-esque monologue and works perfectly.

{"text":"Olaf Rupp, Tony Buck, Joe Williamson, \"Weird Weapons 2\u2033\n\nAt first, I was worried that this was going to be the type of improv recording that would be too difficult for my tastes. There's only 2 tracks on this CD and they're both nearly a half hour long each, and the first one starts out with plenty of amelodic scraping, stretching and clanging. After about ten minutes of listening, however, I realized that I was completely enthralled by what I was hearing. Joe Williamson's double bass and Tony Buck's drums are played in such uncoventional ways that they don't make a whole lot of sense at first. But what really ties everything together is Olaf Rupp's acoustic guitar playing. He eventually settles into some sort of phasing pattern, which contrasts with the dark, dissonant bowing that Williamson is playing. Then Rupp begins picking very intricately, and then gets absolutely frenzied, almost sounding like he's about to break the guitar. He sounds furious! Buck's snare rolling perfectly compliments this. Once this recording clicks, it becomes easier to just sit back and enjoy. The album mostly continues the same frenzied, manic pace, with furious, intricate playing, but also a few slightly more recognizably \"jazzy\" drum fills and basslines. During the last 5 minutes it seems to cool down somewhat, although it still sounds a biy nervy. All told, a gripping session."}

{"text":"Release Details\n\nTODD\n\nPurity Pledge\n\n8.7\n\nposted on 3\/2005 By: Drew Ailes\n\nRemember Hammerhead? From Fargo? No? That's right you don't, because they're one of the more under-appreciated and overlooked bands of the 1990's thanks to people like you. Releasing four full lengths on the now-defunct Minneapolis noise\/rock label, Amphetamine Reptile, they received very little notoriety but left a curiously long-lasting mark in the minds of music geeks. Which is understandable, seeing as how Amrep mainly received attention for their releases by prolific names like Helmet, The Melvins, Today is the Day, and even Unsane, but attracted the interest of anyone in search of cutting and bizarre rock. To tie things together, Todd features Hammerhead's Craig Clouse as a frontman amongst a cast of other talented musicians.\n\nPurity Pledge reminds me a lot of the jokes people make about having \"bad trips\" while being stoned. While most people scoff at this simple notion, the few people that it's happened to can testify to how horrifying it is. The only way that I can personally describe it is being smothered by an electric blanket that's turned on too high, while having to watch your grandparents cheat on each other at the same time. Dropping the remotely indier elements of Hammerhead, Todd are the antithesis of stoner-rock, epitomizing this feeling by taking the warm fuzzy tones of the genre and perverting and twisting them into something thought-provoking - both sedating and confusingly perilous. It's a wrecking ball made out of the compressed flesh of downtrodden and homeless, crashing into a rehabilitation center for quaalude and barbiturate addicts. Often the name of the game is hypnosis through reiteration, beating a few parts into your head time and time again. \"Sharon After Prom\" begins the album with a reluctant pulse and doomy tendency before moving on to the tightly-wound \"Little Dipper To Squirrel\", which could bare its teeth right alongside one of Big Black's more destructive tunes, sans their industrial tinge. Puzzlingly, when things change, their huge and apocalyptic groovy songs wander about the fretboard on occasion while keeping the same beat and mammoth vocals. \"Mr. Harry\" has sort of a cerebral old TITD vibe, but with far more coherence and a larger and steadier sound than Austin's manic (yet brilliant) project, while the repetitive and spacey jamming on \"Sedan\" only supports the brick-heavy initial riff which makes its return to finish off the track. The songs where things sound remotely upbeat, like \"Miss Longhornspeedway\", still have this effect like being cornered by a strange old man, unsure of whether you're about to be molested or given a reassuring pat on the back.\n\nSo while a great deal of talented names of the noise\/rock scene passively drifted under the noses of music critics and into obscurity, it's uplifting to know that there's still a few people dedicated to drinking and making violent and catchy music. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and that's truly depressing to a guy like me. Hopefully Todd are able to arouse enough interest in old Hammerhead fans as well as stimulate the stoner-rock crowd into a few purchases to keep them going. Purity Pledge is a great album that you don't have to be familiar with the band's roots in order to enjoy."}

Why does the new music community (and the classical community, more broadly) stick to 8pm start times, with the occasional matinee thrown in? And, of course, the dreaded 7:30 start time, which exists solely for the purpose of making all your friends a half-hour late because every reasonable human being knows that Concerts Start at Eight.\n\nThe official start time for Innovocal Thursday night at the 92Y Tribeca, part of the SONiC Afterhours festival-within-a-festival, was 11pm, but the show took its time as the audience got their drinks from the bar and chatted each other up on their leisurely walk to the tables. Most of the audience appeared to be people associated with SONiC, or their friends, but rather than feeling like an insiders' club, there was a genuinely warm social buzz in the room.

Their music is so informed by ethnic traditions and the feeling of different universes co-existing inside a single record that they produce music that contains a full, rich history of the stars.\n\nThe first track, and the longest, taking up about a fifth of the album total, is a huge transformation from drum patterns to strangulated gasping murky breath?keyboards, static beats and the ever-present cyclical vocal moans sway in a giddy pattern, tumbling over and over each other as I imagine James Ferraro and Spencer Clark writhing in their basement and wringing their hands and heads and feet as the sounds are shaken out of them by mountain gods and ghosts. This is some of the densest Skaters I?ve heard, yet out of the gloriously addictive shadow these high-pitched cries still emanate, still entice you inside.\n\nThe third track exhibits a whole bunch of ecstatic vocal loops, and the fact that the process of these moans being sung, looped, worked over and manipulated is part of the track itself is even more of a testimony to these dudes? improvisational prowess and ability to tap into any direction they want, allowing themselves to be transported by the spirits of the music they?ve made. This is almost the ghosts of music?echoes of ancient guardians of the muse throwing coins down the empty iron well?Sounds like they were just jamming for about a week STRAIGHT and every now and then a friend came down to put the tape recorder on and feed them. The high-white cries grounded in the sodden earth of rumbling tape-bass and everything in-between contains inflections and movements only they can hear, and they?re keeping it close. Surges and purges. Awesome. 8\/10 -- Evan Rhodes"}
{"text":"Graveyard Train are a Melbourne band who who sing a strange mesh of foot stomping country, folk and horror songs. They're coming up to Darwin for Hot August Nights! GRIND got to chat to Josh \u2013 the humble banjo player.\n\n1. Where did the name Graveyard Train come from?\n\nWe're all sort of Creedence fans so um I think we got right into the one particular song called Graveyard Train about a bus that goes down and carts off all the souls down to hell \u2013 or something like that (laughs). I haven't heard it in a long time, yeah it was just a stupid idea.\n\n2. The initial idea was for you guys to sing in baritone about Werewolves, Vampires, Ghosts and the like over frenetic foot stomping country music Where did this idea come form and how did it all come to life?\nAt the time there were a few dark country bands in Melbourne , you know, singing about death and despair, Johnny Cash style, darker country songs. I think Nick, yeah, Nick Finch the lead singer wanted to just write more about horror themes like werewolves, cheesy mummies and witches so it sort of took of there as a l bit of a joke. Its became little more serious after that and the songs certainly change. But that was the initial idea 4 years ago.\n\n4. How did the grouop form?\n\nWe actually all worked together in this pub and we sort of all got fired, so one dropped off and the other dropped off.. I lasted the longest. We were all mates though and into music so we just decided to give it a go. It was just a bit of fun really.\n\n5. Adam plays the chain yeah? Does he get a little bored of that?\n\n(Laughs). He was the first one to gert fired! Yeah I guess so. Yeah he certainly gets a bit over it here and there, but that's not all he does, he plays the harp as well.\n\n6. Do you all sit down together and come up with the lyrics?\n\nIt's a collaboration definitely for the first couple of albums. But I think that we've all had enough of each other for a little while and so the song writing gets spread out a bit more.\n\n7. How do you feel about the reaction from your audiences? Were you expecting such and positive response?\nNot at all, like I said you know, country music really wasn't that popular in the scene, so we didn't anticipate crowds at all, and then when it became a sort of sing along it was really welcomed by all of us that's for sure. It just really came as a shock and then it just got bigger and bigger and more people got involved and said that you should push a bit more with this. Its always been fun so its pretty easy to play the music, and have people rock up (laughs).\n\n8. Why do you think people are so attracted to your music?\nIt certainly doesn't sound like any other band. None of us are really great musicians and so we all sort of bounce of each other to keep the song going. Thats what made it it unique I guess. Nick Finch, in particular, is a really good song writer and so is Beau and when you put those types of people together you definitely get something original. I think that's why people continue to come to the shows. Yeah we've been told we put on more of a performance as oppose to just playing songs. We've got a better live reputation, radio always been sort of hard for us, its gives us a bit of support here and there, but other people say that live shows are where Graveyarad Train is the best. And it does sound completely different because we record in studios and stuff and when its on stage we're all amped up and it's a lot louder.\n\n9. What have you learned in your new sense of fame and touring, any lessons in life you'd like to share?\n\nYeah vitamin C tablets and a pack of panadole and clean socks, and don't sleep in the same room as Beau, he's got a bit of a snoring problem! (laughs)\n\n10. What is your favourite song of yours and, why?\nOh, that's a tuff one! We've got this song we've never really recorded called\u2026.Man I can't even remember what its called\u2026 Umm\u2026 No such thing as ghosts - Fran the Drummer just reminded me(laughs) \u2013 Hmmm, why do I like that one, I guess because it used to really embarrass me when we played it live cause we make these stupid ghost noises and ghoul noises and Adam makes some sort of horse noises and its just ridiculous, just stupid. And now I don't care anymore and just have a bit of fun with it.\n\n11. Who inspires you?\nEveryone's got different inspirations I rekon. When the band first started I as getting into hankling and a lot of bluegrassy stuff like Bill Munroe, Fran the drummer just mention The Stranglers. Now days I've been getting into a bit more of louder psychedelic stuff. I was listening to a band called the Black Angles, yeah I got right into their album last year. Its pretty cool!\n\nLive chat\n\nGOOD KARMA! Anything you write on this chat will be moderated and may be removed.\nSo please keep it clean and serene - not mean.\n\nLatest Message6 hours, 39"}
{"text":"Other Artists Like Espers\n\nFans of Espers\n\nEspers - Ii\n\nAlbum Details\n\nAfter two solid releases (2004's Espers and 2005's cover collection The Weed Tree), Philly's worldly-folk act Espers set course for a beefier, more well-rounded sound on II. Adding members has certainly done that, and when you consider the group's maturity and already-defined prowess for penning intricate and invasive folk songs, it's not hard to see why II is Esper`s pinnacle in their short but sweet existence.\n\nAs the album progresses, you get a feeling of themes and provocations oozing through their gloomy folk. They really waste no time on this front; opener \"Dead Queen\" spreads it's wings over 8 minutes of wonderfully expressive strings, subdued guitar passages and beautiful female vocals courtesy of Meg Baird. Indeed, it's her soaring, passionate voice that gives II a warm embracing of soul. From track to track, various instrumental interludes and songs-within-songs rise up from the ethereal atmosphere created. Only slightly disjointed is the flow over the 2nd half of the record, but to notice such things is an example of this reviewer`s picky nature.\n\nFew complaints when dealing with II. You won't want to listen to any of the songs alone, as the album is really one long progressing movement that fluctuates and rebounds off of it's own twists and turns. It's sort of like riding a see-saw as a child, with the other seat taken by a much bigger and much stronger kid; you're just along for the ride. Expressively beautiful without being pretentious or too focused on what I find to be a stale style of music (which is to say, they inject enough into their folk leanings to almost demand such a tag to be left off of them), II shows Espers to be a force of creative energy and unbridled folk spirit, impressively fusing genres and sound-scapes into what eventually feels like an all-too-short journey."}
{"text":"first review of anything on Amazon, though I am a constant reader. I simply had to talk about this album.\n\nThe best way to describe this album is fearless. He takes the road less traveled by other up-and-coming singer-songwriters. While the new batch has had some very good singers, nothing compares to this album. They seem more interested in making a \"clean\" album, while this album seems like he is alone in a room baring his soul.\n\nThough the strange thing is about the album s that you know he could not have been alone in a room. There is so much going on, so many chances taken that it is hard to descibe. Simply saying that it is an acoustic album is wrong. The album brings in much more.\n\nFearless in his atempts to expand beyond just him and his guitar. Consider how at the end of Amie, out of nowhere comes what sounds like an entire orchestra. It sounds beautiful and it becomes almost impossible to imagine the song without it. Then the gorgarian (sp?) chants that enter into Cold Water. By the end of the album it seems only appropriate to have an opera singer at the end of Eskimo.\n\nBut the wonderful things about the album is that it doesn't rely on these tricks. They are simply used to enchance the songs. Cannonball is simply him and his guitar, and it is one of the best songs on the album (a song friends of mine have confessed crying to when they heard it).\n\nAnother huge difference between him and others is the feeling involved. I have yet to hear another singer coming out now who you can feel their pain so clearly and identify with it(Howie Day is close). The only line in the chorus of The Blower's Daughter is \"I can't take my eyes off you...\" The way he sings it and the passion in his voice make the line more romantic and meaningful than an entire boy-band album.\n\nJust the other night I went outside with my CD Player to sit on the front porch and listen to music while I smoked a cigarette. I started at track one, and became so engrossed in the songs, I just sat there until the album finished. It is THAT good. And it is that feeling that is put into every song that gives me the impression this album will age very well.\n\nI agree with others that he brings back memories of when Jeff Buckley was around. They invoke the same spirit. And that is nothing but a compliment, because if there is anything music needs now, it is someone who can do to people what Jeff did. Even though Jeff died too soon, people are still listening to his music because it means so much to them. I have the feeling that this album will do the same. It is Damien Rice's \"Grace\".\n\nMy only concern is the same as others. How in the hell is he going to follow this up? But here is the fun part, imagine if he somehow makes a better album?\n\nOnly someone so hard-hearted and cold could not be moved by the haunting melodies and heatbreaking lyrics on 'O', an album which to me, represents the bare bones of romance and loss. Damien Rice has a wonderful, piercing voice which delivers true, passionate, realistic, raw emotion. He sells his own songs so naturally, so beautifully, that it is almost impossible to not get immersed into this CD's clear, palpable feelings. It's romantic and sad without being corny. It's melodic and instrumental without being over-produced. It's emotional without being cliche. 'O' has it all. It is one of the best albums ever recorded."}
{"text":"The Cribs - Martell (Wichita)\n\nUK release date: 22 August 2005\n\nLoved by everyone, bought by no one. The Cribs are in every sense the underdogs. Barely an interview goes by without the current crop of bands pledging their admiration from this Wakefield trio. Their best known champions, Kaiser Chiefs, predicted the musical riot and hopped onto the nearest Lear jet to superstardom. Yet, The Cribs have remained in the beer swilling holes where it all began.\n\nFortunately, for all their knock backs they haven't lost their sense of humour. The tongue was firmly in the cheek when they called their second album New Fellas. Latest single, Martell, opens with the line; \"How hard can it be to get a slap on the back from a room full of morons?\". It might sound bitter on paper but underpinned with one of the finest melodies ever put to guitar, it's nothing short of joyous. You can instantly see their point. Forget Knebworth; by rights they should be playing to crowds that stretch the entire length of the British Isles. Write a checklist of everything that makes a great song, a great band. Actually, don't bother - just buy this. Or even better, buy the album.\n\nAs beguilingly undervalued by music lovers as Phil Collins is enduringly popular with the everyman."}
{"text":"Back at June's Polyphonic Panorama at Chicago's Abbey Pub, we were graced by the presence of Hellblinki and the midway marvel Sanjula Vamana. In the dim light of the dance floor, he discreetly introduced his manhood (i.e. whipped out his pierced tallywhacker). He fastened it to a chair and spun about like a dervish. A veritable chair-nado of the crotch.\n\nBut this would not be quite so wond'rous if the very same Hellblinki did not have a song called \"Sanjula's Junk\" on the album that appears on this very aether-page! It's a bouncy little ditty with some old-timey, voh-de-oh-doh vocals.\n\nThe dance at the show was an example of mutual benefit. Artists supporting artists! The object of affection and tribute offered his own tribute to the merry-makers.\n\nAs a community, let us celebrate each other and our talents. Support independent artists like Hellblinki, Sanjula and the Chicagoans who made their dance possible."}
{"text":"Jesca Hoop creates a curious kitsch of flamenco-folk traditions over modern living sentiments, and it's blooming hard to define.\n\nIt's a sound that you'd expect to come from an American homesteader who then settled as a nanny for Tom Waits' family: It meanders, but (tediously for a profile) is simultaneously conclusive; it's what you wanted Fiona Apple to sound like if she wasn't so darn depressed all the time."}
{"text":"The sounds of swishing water begin \"I'm Gluck,\" and soon a droning reverberation (which feels as if it's been there, underlying everything, at the album's spine the whole time thus far) resumes the venture (by boat rather than car this time) through a landscape of dreams. You can virtually see the twilight setting, feeling as if you're fading away from the world, and just when you're about to fall off asleep\u2026the crass sound of a pNEUmatic drill suddenly blows that peacefulness into smithereens.\n\nIt doesn't take long to become familiar with the image of the duo laboriously recording their work, hidden from sight in a bunker while living in the remains of a commune in some secret, rural location. The world of \"Turquoise Hexagon Sun,\" as we may perceive it, is a kaleidoscope of desolate green pastures, ice-cold seas, abandoned lighthouses, and a horizon of serene blue skies. Somewhere in the belly of a forest near Scotland's Pentland hills, hallucinogenics are being consumed around a bonfire, their music the soundtrack to the experience."}

{"text":"There's a ghost that haunts the margins of Ben Gibbard's solo debut, \"Former Lives.\" It's not his ex-wife Zooey Deschanel, from whom Gibbard recently split after two years of marriage. It's another singer-songwriter with indie-scene roots who became a major star, ended up in L.A. and confronted some substance-abuse demons: Elliott Smith."}
{"text":"While the band DIIV changed their name from Dive, they retained their knack for skilfully crafting beautiful dream pop\/shoegaze\/indie tunes.\n\nThe LP diversifies itself into three blended sounds and does it in a very well-crafted manner. As soon as the first track '(Druun)' starts, you know you're in for a ride when it enters with thumping drums, light but noticeable guitar and thundering bass, which shifts the track up a gear and doesn't waste any time in beginning the immersive experience that is Oshin.\n\n'Past Lives' is a very excitable, energetic track, filled with synths and jangly guitar melodies. Even if you can barely hear and understand the lyrics, they exude this feeling and vibe, which fits the track very well. 'How Long Have You Known' could perhaps be described as the quintessential track on the album, filling every quota for each instrument, coming together like a perfect scene in a film or a gorgeous landscape.\n\nNot that it means much to the song's beauty, but you can actually hear the lyrics clearly. \"How long have you known?\" sighs frontman Z Cole Smith's exuberant vocal, \"and how long has it shown? Forever, if ever.\"\n\nEvery single track on Oshin is a breath-taking experience, meaning that you can't simply skim over one track and feel good about yourself. All of the music is accessible, light and dreamy, and the music sometimes echoes Disintegration-era The Cure. 'Follow' is a track that really echoes this statement \u2014 it's just missing the patented Robert Smith vocal delivery.\n\nOverall, the album shines brilliantly throughout. In every niche of every song, there's something brilliant \u2014 from the splashy cymbals to the swirling guitars, harmonious vocals and the booming bass. DIIV has made an album that evokes styles that combine together to create a euphonious harmony."}
{"text":"share this story\n\nThere's no-one in the world that can play like these three together...there's something happening musically like an undercarriage that's just there, that's magical...\n\nSo said Ian Brown at the announcement that the Stone Roses would be reforming, and I didn't dare to believe that it was true at the time, but I have seen the light, or I certainly lived in that dream. That undercarriage is the Reni-Mani axis of drums and bass, so vast is it in scope that any of John Squire's colour dotted adornments explode into the stratosphere or creep along the deepest sea of soul, and Ian Brown is a shamen, a soothsayer, a monkey king, Peter Piper or the Pied Piper, whatever myth you care to choose, the genius of the man is a presence that you will not conjure by discussing whether or not he can hit a B-flat.\n\nI'm standing here\/I really don't think you could know\/that I'm in heaven when you smile.\n\nIt would not do justice to the Stone Roses' third night at Heaton Park to break down a set list, the songs that weren't played would have been musically watertight and carried the same electricity. Gems like What the World is Waiting For were still a ghost like presence from myth-world in the beach ball globe that Brown hurled into the crowd at the end of the gig to bounce around the outpouring of love and excitement that this crowd crackled with. Daybreak and other tracks screaming with live potential didn't get an outing, but the whole show could be described as a natural and seamless trance, no dance drugs needed, no clever slogans about 'baggy' or genre melding, but waves of energy and rythym that set people somewhere out of their own skins. This is still future music because it connects with the parts of us that do not change and it defies critique the same way African drums do.\n\nThis was religious in effect. It reduced many people to head shaking disbelief at times, hands covering faces or quiet and separated moments to themselves. Like religious ritual or syncopated drum happenings or Aboriginal stick clicking there was molten soul beneath this collection of classic songs, the well known lyrics and inducing guitar riffs of course harness people in to the relationships they have built with the pop songs over the years, but despite staying faithful to the form of the songs - letting 75,000 people howl along - this was a jam of transcendent proportions, and a reminder why the simplicity of two guitars and a drum kit is it's very own art form. I would go further than that with this collection of players to say it is a true national treasure, in a land that doesn't do political dissension brilliantly well, but wow does it do sub-culture.\n\nFool's Gold snaked into its own reptilian funk, supposed 'rock' song Love Spreads spat and mangled complete with Brown rapping, Mani and Reni seemed to drive the patterns of the light show like a future spun Brian Eno artwork, and the night careered like a never ending club high, relentless brilliance for near on 20 songs. This kind of transcendence may well be the last throes of a world that can be represented by three instruments and a voice, but it is timely proof that the formula exists for us all to step out from the clanking faltering remnants of our industrial islands and rediscover the ecstasies of being a human. I know that sounds overblown, but it really is that relevant and important, it wasn't all just a dream.\n\nThere's no-one in the world that can play like these three together...there's something happening musically like an undercarriage that's just there, that's magical...\nSo said Ian Brown at the announ...\n\nThere's no-one in the world that can play like these three together...there's something happening musically like an undercarriage that's just there, that's magical...\nSo said Ian Brown at the announ..."}

{"text":"Nashville based Seth Walker's newest record, Time Can Change hit store shelves in June, and he'll be making his way back through Texas at the end of July (including stops at The Saxon Pub and Waterloo Records). He took the time to answer some of our questions about his music, creative process and the super power he wishes he had.\n\nQ: Your latest record was funded largely by a Kickstarter campaign, how did the early fan involvement impact the record?\n\nA: We launched the Kickstarter campaign in August of 2011, about halfway into the recording process. It impacted the effort greatly. This outpouring really inspired and reminded me of the unwavering support of my fans. Unbelievable.\n\nQ: You've said that Time Can Change is a 'culmination of the continuing search for a way to write, sing and record in a new way.' What are some lessons you've learned on that path?\n\nA: Well trusting yourself is a biggie. Influence is good and a must, but you must find your own way to express yourself as an artist- an ongoing process mind you. If I don't believe in it, no one else will. This album was also recorded in a new way for me- all live playing and vocal with no headphones. It's the most honest recording I've done to date. I just sang and played, and there it was.\n\nQ: How does this record fit in along the other work you've done?\n\nA: It is different in the approach. This one is very intimate, and I feel that much of the nuance of my singing is captured here that may have gotten lost in previous efforts. In the same breath, I feel it is a continuation. Old fashioned music done a slightly new way.\n\nQ: What does your creative process look like?\n\nA: As far as the writing goes, most of my inspiration and creative ideas come in the morning. I don't know why. Maybe the weight of the day hasn't pressed down on my creative spirit yet! I always feel fresh coming out of a dream.\n\nQ: You started your career in Austin but have since moved to Nashville, how are the two cities similar or different in terms of the musical community?\n\nA: Both are amazing music cities. I lived in Austin full time for 15 years, and it will always be the root to my beginnings of this business. The Austin music community and family is second to none. Nashville is a deep scene as well. Just more of it. I compare to an onion. So many layers of musicians, writers, producers, engineers, and industry folk etc. It is a great place to be if music is your life, which it is. I'm also originally from NC, so it hits a little closer to home.\n\nQ: If you could sit down for an hour and play with any musician, alive or dead, who would it be and what would you ask them?\n\nA: Ray Charles. What's the secret to letting go every time you sing?\n\nQ: How did you decide to become a musician? Did you ever consider another career path?\n\nA: I started as a cellist. My parents were both Suzuki teachers and had me sawing at the age of 5. I never considered another path. I guess it's always been my calling of sorts. Except when I wanted to be Michael Jordan of course\u2026 We see where that went.\n\nQ: What superpower do you wish you had?\n\nA: Super hearing. So I could hear all the voicings and chord changes to compose like Ellington and Beethoven.\n\nQ: Is there something that you've wanted to learn how to do but haven't had the time for?\n\nA: How to hit a golf ball correctly\u2026and really play the piano. I mean really play it.\n\nQ: Is there anything else people listening to your music need to know about you?\n\nA: I love subtle music that speaks loudly. I also aspire to never settle and always lean into something new with every performance, song or album.\n\nSeth will be at Waterloo Records 7\/23 for an in-store performance and the Saxon Pub 7\/28."}

Since then, the Vacncouver sextet have refined their sound to reflect nothing other than their unique and exquisite collective musicianship. Comprising aforesaid and sprinklings of swing, Celtic allure, and M\u00e9tis stylings, this album seamlessly blends tradition with originality - a delightful listen.\n\nOpening track 'Saskatchewan' combines M\u00e9tis-style fiddle and subtle steel guitar tones. Fittingly written by fiddler and singer Kathleen Nisbet, it's a story about the west with stunning harmonies. The album's initial relaxed atmosphere is just a cheeky warm up, apparent when the album's title track upturns the pace for a portion of country styled swing. Kathleen's vocal during 'Hanging Ground' has a soulful diva quality which neatly succumbs to the song's sorrowful guitar. Compare that to the album's Celtic finale 'Red River Jig' and you get a long play unlike any other. Viper Central are a bluegrass band with pleasing versatility."}
{"text":"The Hauntingly Poetic Punk Rock of the Suuns\n\nSuuns' moody, messy art rock emerges from Montreal's Mile End\n\nHailing from the hometown of Godspeed! You Black Emperor and Arcade Fire, Suuns's dark experimentations are hauntingly poetic. They have been compared to Sonic Youth, booked on Secretly Canadian, and toured with the Crystal Castles and Black Angels. At Pop Montreal just a few weeks ago, the band premiered the film Sweet Nothing, inspired by their first tour in Europe. We had a contemplative chat with singer-songwriter Ben Shemie, who trained classically and had his first musical revelation at a Metallica concert. But we'll have to wait with baited breath until the next album to see what he's truly thinking of right now\u2026\n\nYou actually attended McGill University to study jazz. How did your training affect the music?\n\nWhen I was about 17 I had musical ambitions and I really didn't know what I wanted to do, but I wanted to play the guitar. My teacher made me work really hard to get into McGill. At the time I loved Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Cream, The Rolling Stones, stuff from my parents' record collection. So going to school was perhaps an extension of that fantasy. But it was really difficult; it was a really introspective and hard thing to do. It's not a really healthy way of studying music; when you're young you're very impressionable. It was a real struggle because it was really hard to scrutinize yourself and examine your progress, and living up to these fantastic ideals that don't even exist, really.\n\nHow did you end up in a rock band?\n\nI had been out of school and wanted to start playing rock'n'roll because that was the first thing I identified with. All the band members come from similar music backgrounds; we liked ACDC, Bryan Adams, U2, all the stuff that was popular in the early '90s. That's what started everything. I don't think my training has affected the music at all, I don't think it's at all intellectual in that way. Our training mostly comes in in the way we rehearse, because we can articulate things clearly.\n\nI read you had your first rock awakening at a Metallica concert?\n\nI went at 12 and it changed the way I thought about everything. It was the first rock show I'd ever been to. I was terrified when I went in. Metallica was at the height of their popularity and when you're 12 you associate it to bad things \u2014 drugs, sex, things you don't understand. But it was just a big party, it was amazing. It was really loud. The guitar player was amazing and it was a big crazy rock show. We don't really see shows like that that often. They certainly encapsulated everything; a fantasy of heavy metal, rock'n'roll, all the adoration and ego that goes into these kinds of things which is attractive, especially when you're really young.\n\nWhat do you write and sing about?\n\nSome of the songs, like \"Arena,\" is kind of like a dance song. Or a song like \"Sweet Nothing\" is a little narrative about being in a band in Quebec, the difference in culture, creating a little snapshot story about what it means to be in a band here. \"Armed for Peace\" is pretty representative of what we do. It says, \"It's all because we've gone and taken it all\/And I know that it's up to you.\" It's kind of about music, not taking anything too seriously. It has an anthemic vibe to it. It's actually really hard to play.\n\nSome people find it hard to label your band.\n\nI think it's a compliment. I feel like our band is really polarizing. People either really really like it or really really don't. It's hard to label it and talk about it but we do have a common style that you can identify as us. It's difficult to talk about what we do and put a name on it but it's not really my problem. It makes it a bit less accessible but that's ok. The album is structured like a playlist, it has an arc to it which is important. You have slow songs first, jam songs in the middle. Some people will dance cause they like it, but it's not like our intention. We just want to put on a good show, play really well \u2014 it's entertainment. We try to have a good time ourselves and play the shit out of the songs. We do justice to the songs. We work really hard as a band, so a lot of time there's a lot of sweat that goes into it. So that's kind of a privilege; we want it to be good.\n\nSo is it more post-punk? Art rock?\n\nI understand why people say that because it's not pop, it is cerebral in a way. It works for people that are into rock music, aggressive music, minimal music, dance music, also a bit more interested in something a bit more cerebral. It's more important to be interesting than to be good. There are a lot of good bands but if it's not interesting and if there's nothing\u2026. It's one thing to write pleasant songs that people will like. We get compared a lot to Krautrock bands, which is totally cool because it's minimal and repetitive, but until we got compared to them I hadn't really listened to them.\n\nFrom basement stages to Secretly Canadian. Tell me the story.\n\nWe started playing here, our first show was at a loft party. Our first legitimate show was during Pop Montreal in 2007, when we hadn't even played that much. I was really nervous and stuff. We played first of six bands so there weren't that many people and stuff. Even at that stage we had never really recorded anything, we weren't even really a band. And then we just started playing a lot. Small shows. Did that for like three years. There was no reaction. We didn't really get any press or play for anyone else than our friends. In Toronto, people started enjoying it. We never got any press in Montreal because there are so many bands living and working here, and you're one of many, many bands that have to prove themselves. Very, very few of those bands get past the local scene that we live in.\n\nThen we recorded with Jace Lasek of the Besnard Lakes at Breakglass Studios. We recorded this album that he liked and he saw something there. Literally, it was almost like a dream. We printed 200 CDs with a crappy little cover, and the same day it arrived in the mail I got an email from Secretly Canadian. We didn't really try \u2014 it just fell in our laps, which never happens. We just got really lucky. They endorsed us and immediately within two weeks we had a lawyer, a booking manager\u2014 it became professional very quickly. Summer 2010. Literally overnight it became legit. Media would listen to us; people would take our band seriously. It just makes the process of playing shows easier; you're not an indie band struggling in Montreal. But it's fucking hard\u2026. One thing you learn is that the music industry is exactly that, an industry. You see that it's a business. It kind of commodifies your music and you become more ambitious which makes it so much more of a product. It changed the way we operate as a band and what a successful show becomes. Our expectations are higher now.\n\nWant to see who else is popping on the Canadian Music scene? Want to discover other artists from Montreal that are ready to blow?

{"text":"Interview: The Drums\n\nOn life, their new album, and Joy Division.\n\nThe Drums have a keenness of spirit that's difficult to define. Acutely aware of their musical origins and creative intent, they project a brand of pop characterised by a nostalgic, snappy brightness of sound, tinged with an irrevocable undertone of melancholy. The articulate directness with which they present themselves is matched only by the tightness of their riffs and their deliberate ambiguity of sentiment. Oyster spoke with guitarist Jacob Graham about their latest release, Portamento, what it means to be real, and having an absence of aspirations.\n\nJacinta Mulders:I know you get asked this a lot, but how does Portamento compare with your EP and your debut album? Jonathan [Pierce, The Drums' vocalist] said in an interview that while you wanted your EP to be cinematic, on Portamento every song is a scene from real life. Can you expand on this? Jacob Graham: I'd say our first record was more like The Drums' fantasy world and this album is The Drums in a real world setting. On our first album every song was just sort of written about a lovely idea, so each song was like a little scene from an old movie. But on the new record the subject matter is set in the present. And I think the sound of the new record is a little more fine tuned and a little less washed out than the first. I think the whole thing is just crisper all around.\n\nHow do you feel about Portamento? What, in your eyes, characterises this album? I think bluntness is the main characteristic \u2013 lyrically, and musically. I'd say it's a pretty straight-forward pop album with unconventional instrumentation sprinkled throughout. A little darker in hue than most straight forward pop albums perhaps.\n\nCan you tell me about Visiomento? Sure. Visiomento is a series of episodes we're making that sort of gives our listeners a sneak peak into the creative process, rehearsal process, and also so interviews of ourselves and people we admire. I think more than anything, it's a way to connect with our fans, in our own sort of context. Visiomento!\n\nOn your website you talk a lot about how Portamento is a lot 'realer' than The Drums. There is also a comment that you wouldn't have allowed anything that 'real' to be on the first one. Why is that? It was simply the concept of our first album to write that way. It didn't have anything to do with not being comfortable to write about personal matters, it was just a stylistic decision.\n\nOn your website, you say that although 'Down By the Water' is the 'realest' song on The Drums, \"It's more cinematic, like you're watching a scene instead of feeling a particular way\". What is it about a song that makes it more cinematic? I don't know if I feel still feel that way. I feel as though, what I meant was that 'Down By The Water' was the saddest song on our first album. I'd probably say 'Book of Stories' is the most 'real'. A line like, \"I thought my life would get easier, instead it's getting harder\". That's pretty real.\n\nI agree with your original comment about 'Down By the Water'. I feel like that song transcends time and is gorgeously romantic, but it's cinematic in that I feel like I'm watching a story that belongs to someone else. What do you see when you play that song? I'd rather not say what I see when I hear the song. I'd rather people have their own visions, unclouded by my own.\n\nWhat's your favourite Joy Division song? What do you think of New Order? Or is it all about The Wake? For me it really is all about The Wake. I couldn't care less about Joy Division. I think New Order had some amazing moments, but over all were pretty hit or miss. My favorite New Order song is 'Leave Me Alone'. I think The Wake are the most perfect band that ever was, no comparison.\n\nCan you describe the relationships between the band members? I can't. Something along the lines of \"it's complicated\".\n\nWhat are your aspirations for the future of The Drums? How would you like to develop? No aspirations. We just want to keep doing what we're doing. And we don't want to develop; we want to remain stagnant forever, untouched by time."}

{"text":"There's a growing scene of artists based primarily in NY (at least as far as the US scene is concerned) dedicated to the concept of making music using old video game hardware. Being fairly new to the scene myself, I don't claim to know much; but I have heard some really good stuff that's come out of it (you may recall this post about fellow \"chip scene\" artist Mark Denardo). However, until now I have not enjoyed anything I've heard as much as I do today's track. This song was recommended to me by a friend, and I am happy to pass the recommendation along to our readers.\n\nAnamanaguchi go beyond just making sounds with NES hardware, and integrate their 8-bit music with a full live-band setup (drums, bass, and two guitars). The electronic sounds mesh seamlessly with the more traditional components to create some of the most enjoyable power-pop I've heard recently.

{"text":"Entertainment\n\nThey bake up hits: CAKE comes to Pipeline Cafe.\n\nImage: CAKE\n\nCAKE bakes a jam\n\nInterview by Adrienne LaFrance | Mar 31, 2010\n\nDated\n\nThrough Sat, Apr 6 Honolulu Weekly called original CAKE trumpeter, keyboardist and percussionist Vince DiFiore to chat about pop music, environmentalism and why he feels like a lobster.\n\nFirst things first: How sick are you of questions about the edible kind of cake?\n\n[Laughs] Well, we always ask specifically that if someone's making a poster for a show, no cake imagery may be used. We're pretty serious about that. The word cake is meant to be a non sequitur or maybe a verb. You know, like how mud gets caked on your shoe.\n\nWhat's the worst cake-related pun you've seen in a headline about the band?\n\nYes! [Laughs] Probably something like, 'They bake up hits,' or 'CAKE bakes a jam.' But it's all been nice! It's usually a compliment. They mean well.\n\nYou've been in CAKE since it started in 1991. How have you seen American music change in that time?\n\nIt seems like it's gotten bigger and bigger. The way that music is produced is different now, like the stakes keep getting raised. A lot of the popular music right now is very epic sounding. And since we've been around, the women have really come to the forefront. You know, the independent woman as a focal point of the music. That seems to be really popular. Even the way people listen to music is changing. But we still believe in the album. When we finish this record, we want it to be a good listening experience from beginning to end with that arc from start to middle to finish. For me, these changes, it's kind of like I feel like a lobster getting boiled in a pot. You don't notice the water getting hot around you.\n\nDo you often find you're listening to newer artists and that lack of narrative is sort of a shock to the ear?\n\nYeah, people are just making one pop single after another. It's like, just keep on firing until you get that one pop single. So, they're throwing everything at the one song to make the sparks fly.\n\nLet's talk about the trumpet, which you play, and is a major component of CAKE's sound.\n\nIt's something that has a lot of history in American music, so you're kind of harkening back to a lot of other expressions people have made. Basically, when John [McCrea] was starting the band, he knew he wanted some horns. He wanted his music not to be too overtly happy. There's a bittersweet element to everything, everything has a little bit of a tragic edge to it. The trumpet is a little more immutable to the band than a saxophone and it creates these checks and balances with the electric guitar.\n\nI understand you're the person behind CAKE's Twitter account.\n\nIt's true, it's true. But I don't do anything like, \"I'm making chocolate chip cookies right now,\" or \"I can't find any underwear!\"\n\nI clicked around on your Twitter page a bit in preparing for this conversation\u2013it's a nice little collection of fun facts.\n\n[Laughs] Well, I'm glad to hear that because that's the battle on our Web site! Half the people are telling us to shut up and finish the record, you know, enough with the politics and environmental issues.\n\nFrom what I understand, you guys are pretty devoted to the cause\u2013a solar-powered studio, a ride-sharing program to concerts, giving away trees at shows?\n\nWell, if we wanted to be so true to our environmental concerns, we'd just shut everything down and live in a fort in the countryside, or dig a hole in the ground and live in a burrow. But we still want to play music, and play for people in other cities. We're doing what we can, like using solar and carpool page on our Web site. We aren't going to have any plastic water bottles backstage\u2013we're really aware of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch\u2013so it's mandatory that everyone on tour brings their own canteen. We are a part of the community that's hoping to realign our relationship to the environment.\n\nAnything else you want to add before we hang up?\n\nJust that anyone interested in the band should definitely check out [cakemusic.com]. We have an advice column, a road journal and links to interesting things about the cities we've been in. Oh, and samples of our music, too some"}
{"text":"Superchunk Majesty Shredding\n\nSuperchunk, the Chapel Hill, North Carolina-born indie pioneers, formed in 1989; I was a mere three years old. That means that most of the \"indie\" music, and by extension a lot of other rock genres, I was raised on and enjoy now was directly influenced by this very band. That's a lot of pressure; thankfully, they don't seem to care. For Majesty Shredding, their first album since 2001, they continue to do what they do best: make good alternative music without a care in the world. Except for all their neurosis and rotten luck.\n\nEvern after 21 years as a band, the whole broken-hearted boy with lots of issues and a whole back catalog of heartache shtick still feels fresh. Honing the soundtrack of every white adolescent boy's life, a driving punk rhythm, My Gap Feels Weird adds a layer of pseudo-existentialism to the baseline feeling of inadequacy Caucasian males seem to suffer from. That awkward rock vibe takes a particularly anthemic turn in Crossed Wires. Likening himself to a livewire, frontman Mac McCaughan channels a dirty rock beat while continuing to isolate himself from those around him thanks to his \"crossed wires\". There's no mistaking that a lot of the songs on the album are all about still being a social outcast and an emotional invalid, but there's also no denying their catchiness and appeal. If anyone can realistically portray and tap into the minds of a 21-year-old, it's got to be this band with members nearing their mid-40s.\n\nAfter two-plus decades, most bands like this have to mature, almost by force. Of course, you also hope they still tow that tight line between over-complicating their sound (like with too many textured songs\u2026); Learned to Surf is proof-positive of that balancing act. Akin to a straight shot of sonic espresso, the theme of the song is about getting over yourself, where McCaughan says that \"I stopped swimming, learned to surf\", essentially getting over it all to the ever-so-sweet sounds of boyish, moody guitars. It's also in this album that you can see they've truly accepted their role as legends. Everything At Once will instantly sound like the Surfer Bloods and The Drums of the modern musical landscape. Since Superchunk probably maybe came first, it's both a nod to the new school and the group asserting their dominance of all things indie.\n\nKnowing the age of a band and the time between their last album are all important items to note for context. But when it comes right down to it, they're almost meaningless. Truly great music measures beyond generations and lengths of time and the way we measure those. With this latest effort, Superchunk have proven just that, and done so in their own insightful, rocking way and without compromise. All hail the kings (and queen)."}

Monday, April 27, at the Beaumont Club.\n\nCritiquing Franz Ferdinand is a lot like critiquing Junior Senior or the Ting Tings: What's the point? As long as the girls can shimmy and shake to it and the guys can follow right behind, it's a smashing success. Anyone who dug on FF's first two albums would have a hard time making a case against Tonight: Franz Ferdinand. The group's third album, including the single \"No You Girls,\" is strict dance-floor lightning. When they veer from the formula (as on the folky ballad \"Katherine Kiss Me\"), you can almost see the crowd taking an en masse bathroom break. The good news is that Franz knows a hundred ways to slice the disco-beat pie, penning taut and economical tunes with indefatigable bass lines and silly choruses.

{"text":"Featured articles\n\nQ&A: Joelistics\n\nJagermeister Independent Music Awards\n\nThe Jagermeister Independent music awards celebrate independent music \u2013 what does it mean to you to be an independent artist?\n\nBeing on an independent label is a broad concept these days. Some 'indie' labels have healthy budgets but the majority still struggle to keep the lights on. For me, being an independent artist means having complete creative autonomy. It means workshopping ideas with a team who are passionate, innovative and radical in their thinking.\n\nWhat's the biggest challenge to being an independent artist?\n\nProbably trying to reach your audience in a world saturated by media and then hoping they will pay money for the art you've made and not just download it. As an indie artist you are generally working with a fraction of the budget majors have to throw at the recording, mixing and promo of a new record so it has a completely different effect on the artist's ability to survive and put out another record in the future when a listener downloads.\n\nAnd the best bit?\n\nThe creativity, the relationships you build, the certainty that what you achieve, you achieved from good ideas and hard work and not from just throwing lots of money at something.\n\nWho is your favourite Australian artist\/band of all time, and why?\n\nHard to say decisively but The Avalanches spring to mind, then so does Paul Kelly, Renee Geyer and Regurgitator.\n\nWhat new music to you find exciting at the moment?\n\nThe Weeknd (sounds like R Kelly smoking opium in a strobe lit basement), Gillian Welch (the new album is delicious), Das Racist (Hiphop for culture vultures), Opiuo (banging Australian electro) and David Bowie.\n\nWhat makes Australian music special?\n\nA lot of Australian music, like a lot of Australian culture in general struggles to find it's own identity, and there is the tall poppy syndrome to contend with, but there is an undeniable spirit and innovation that comes from Australian music, an honesty. In comparison to other parts of the world I think we also have a healthy live scene and passionate audiences.\n\nIs this the first time you've been nominated by something and how does it feel?\n\nNo. TZU was nominated for a J award and an AMP award, neither of which we've won. I don't like awards or award ceremonies but it's nice to be nominated.\n\nWho is your favourite opponent from the nominees within your category?\n\nI have an enormous amount of respect for all the other nominees but Sietta are family. James (the producer) is a close friend and was the touring bass player for TZU for some years and Caiti and I have been friends since she lived in Melbourne. I'd say Sietta and Joelistics are the underdogs in our category but I'd love to see Sietta take home the award.\n\nHow do you plan to celebrate if you win?\n\nCocaine, hookers, a limo ride through Frankston with a dwarf stripper sitting on my lap singing 'happy birthday Mr president'...either that or an early night in with my girlfriend and a good book.\n\nIf you are in town for the awards, what do you plan to wear to make you stand out on the red carpet?\n\nI haven't fully decided but I think I might wear a red carpet so that I'm actually camoflaged. I'll be like the awards ceremony predator.\n\nWhat are your plans for the rest of 2011?\n\nI'm currently finishing the new TZU album which will hopefully see the light of day in February 2012. There is a re-mix record of Voyager in the works and I've started work on a futuristic folk album. Stay tuned"}
{"text":"Party Heard Around the World\n\nAlbum Review\n\nParty Heard Around the World is a bit of an odd title for a Lonestar album, given that the band has never been known for kicking out the jams. That's still the case here on their eighth full-length, the first to not be released on BNA and first to feature new vocalist Cody Collins. His presence doesn't alter the identity of the band much; he slides into his allocated space easily, selling the songs without inhabiting them, letting the overall sound wash over. Although Lonestar have shifted away from a major label, they're still gunning for a wide audience because commercialism simply is in their bones. The Lonestar name means nothing if the band isn't big, slick, and crowd-pleasing, which Party Heard Around the World is, even if it seems somewhat stuck in a time warp, fitting within the confines of country radio circa 2000 instead of 2010. That might cut down on their chances of actually being played on radio, but it does result in a satisfying album for fans, one that plays to expectations without quite pandering to them."}
{"text":"world needs more back to basics psychedelic rock. Tame Impala are just about the best at doing that. In October they are following their 2010 breakthrough LP Innerspeaker with Lonerism. Here's the first single - Apocalypse Dreams.\n\nRock'n'roll is a self cannibalising genre. While every other type of music has evolved throughout the time for better or worse, rock music always finds a way to return to its roots when it needs a rejuvenation. All the best rock albums of the last decade or so sound like they were made half a century ago. Maybe that was the reason why Tame Impala's debut LP Innerspeaker was such a brilliant album. It didn't even try to be modern, instead opting to feel like something that came out in the late 60s. That is exactly the reason why it aged so well and is still a pleasant listen to this day. Tame Impala are currently in the process of following it up. In the meantime, two members are also part of a side project Pond, who aim for similar ground but on Beard, Wives, Denim, doesn't achieve the same highs.\n\nBeard, Wives, Denim is Pond's first album to be released on a label. Modular is home to Tame Impala and while Pond dwell in the same psychedelic rock swamp, the music on Beard, Wives, Denim is less tight and pleasant than that on Innerspeaker. Pond are not afraid of longer interludes that do not have a strong rhythmical pattern. When It Explodes is a five minute long rock tune that crashes before it evolves just to break out a nonsensical guitar solo that sounds like a kid learning his first riff. Even the longest moments on Innerspeaker were captivating and not a second felt wasted. On Beard, Wives, Denim Pond feel like they're buying time because there is no strong songwriting to be found. Too many moments on here feel like the part that you would like to skip to get to the good bit and while such records can be hit or miss, listening to every single experiment on here doesn't feel rewarding at all. It feels like a band trying to reinvent what they already perfected.\n\nI do compare this record to Innerspeaker a lot but I can't see how anyone couldn't. It deals with the same sounds and it if was more polished, it could've been a follow up to that album. This LP feels more like a collection of half cooked ideas that the band would only share with their closest friends. The last few tracks finish with the band breaking into laughter and conversations. The album is less focused and could as well be recorded in one take. Not to say that it's all psych wankouts. The middle of the album offer some memorable pop moments. Allergies shows the band recreating the 60s pop sound on one of the best hooks on the album while the follow up You Broke My Cool could've easily been a Girls track, shapeshifting between upbeat verses and downbeat lighters in the air chorus. Moth Wings flirts with the cursed harder edge of rock that Aussies seem to love. The LP offers many things but while Tame Impala's album dealt with it's influences gracefully and came off as a strong album anyway, Beard, Wives, Denim just feels like a couple of high school kids playing along to some of their favourite classic rock legends.\n\nInnerspeaker was and still is a great record because it doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, it feels like all the best records that our stoner parents have listened to and is focused from the start until the very last second. It was a psychedelic rock record than anyone could enjoy. Pond's Beard, Wives, Denim feels like the band just said fuck it and got high somewhere between writing songs and recording them. There's not enough memorable moments to make it enjoyable for outsiders and yet not enough far out moments to make it into a strong psychedelic journey for fans of the genre. It's rare that a side project could eclipse the main band but it's just as rare when a side project's LP sounds like a couple of b-sides and alternative takes to a really young main band was doing in the first place. The phrase waste of time comes to mind."}

{"text":"Lemonade revives the synths of the 80s to create a laid-back album just in time for summer\n\nDiver, the latest release from San Francisco-born, Brooklyn-based Lemonade, is refreshingly understated. In the world of over-produced, gauzy thin pop and autotuned everything, it's really great to hear electronic music that does the genre justice. Though Diver isn't shockingly innovative, Lemonade's ability to blend pop styles from the last few decades makes this album both familiar and new.\n\nThe one trap into which Diver falls with it's understated sound is that some of the tracks aren't as memorable as others. That being said, none of them are subpar. This is an album you can listen to from start to finish without getting the urge to skip that one song that feels out of place. That doesn't mean that the tracks are easily confused: Lemonade takes us through slow tunes with deep sound like \"Vivid,\" and \"Neptune\" but also treat the listener to upbeat, dance-worthy numbers like \"Big Changes,\" \"Ice Water\" and \"Whitecaps.\" These boys utilize a variety of beats to keep the album moving\u2014everything from measured snare beats to groovier rhythms that give a nod to trance music.\n\nOne of the very best things about Diver is the quality of the lyrics \u2014 or really, that there are quality lyrics. Too often have solid electronic songs been let down by throwing in one ambiguous, repetitive lyrics simply to step into the realm of popular music (let's be honest: it isn't going to get onto a pop station without at least one lyric). While the boys from Lemonade don't try to be overly poetic, their lyrics have a good sense of rhythm and are relatable: \"you pocket call me from some party\/ there were so many voices in that room\" (from \"Neptune\"). These lyrics, blended with the synths, beats and other electronic effects, help create a full, balanced sound; no element is too overpowering.\n\nIf you're looking for a laid-back album with popular appeal and a bit more lyrical interest, Diver is it."}
{"text":"As you get older the years begin to pass by without definitive structure, a phenomenon that can lead to confusion when compiling year-end lists. I would look up a profound quote from a semi-obscure poet to further illuminate this, but you also get lazier as you get older. And though perhaps I can no longer keep track of time, I can still get that excitable feeling when I run into some unexpected new pop sensation. I'm not talking about Lana Del Ray or some shit -- try Grace Jones, brothers and sisters! And Kurt Vile is essentially the male Grace Jones, just whiter, more hairy and slacker-y. Those two made the year's best records, each visionary in its own way: one made of slick post-trip-hop lines and angles, the other boasting blurry confidence. The rest of my favorite records of the year (these all came out this year, right?) are the ones I listened to the most: shit-hot bluegrass, obscure '60s soul, minimal electro-pop, and way-solid solo efforts by dudes who otherwise lead canonical bands."}
{"text":"It's an inviting beat. Somewhere between a march and a dance. The Pied Piper should have bought a drum kit instead of one of those cheap-ass magic pipes you can get down the market for a quid. This is definitely the beat that he'd have used to distract the city rats from their determined efforts to get inside people's cavity walls and under their bathtubs. You hear the beat, you turn and follow. It ushers in a gentle howl of controlled feedback. And so Specters begins. It's a concise lesson in how to convert an expectant crowd on first listen.\n\nOnce lured in. it is an album of brevities. Every time a song feels as though it's on the tipping point of becoming a drawn-out, grandiose jam, it's clipped, with perfect timing. Too much of a good thing becomes a gross thing; we know this. It's like having your dinner taken away from you at the crucial moment that hunger turns to greed; you quickly learn to savour the taste. As each plate is carefully withdrawn, there is no more gorging on layers of sound. There's no space for over-indulgence here; just the whispering, confident ambition that Wu (formerly of This Et Al) has brought with him to Stalking Horse.\n\nSpecters is also an album of variety. It may not be immediately apparent, as Wu's voice is a commanding common thread that binds the various components of Stalking Horse. But mid-way through the experience, the piano-led 'Mistress' begins, lending the album an altogether lighter feel. It's a highlight of the album, too, playing into the operatic tendencies of Specters. As Wu sings \"there's no food on the table \/ you're laughing at his bedside manner\" in his strangled, emotive falsetto, he conjures a gothic scene, begging for a dramatic stage play to soundtrack. This is the beauty of Stalking Horse's debut; each track encapsulates a mood, tells a story and does so thoughtfully, deftly, with an artistry that is equal parts considered, eloquent and inspired. The mood of each track is treated delicately. Wu gives the story as much space as the sound, reigning in his distinctive vocal when it threatens to overwhelm, tempered with delicate piano riffs, haunting guitar lines, subtle, cushioned percussion.\n\nWu's last band This Et Al were somewhat overshadowed by the dross that inevitably rises to the top when a city's musical wealth gets plundered by those in search of a marketing plan. The voracious feasting on Leeds' music, which occurred in the mid-Noughties may have left a bitter taste in Wu's mouth, but it seems to have freed up other creative avenues; there's a lightness of touch, here, a playful streak and a determined ebullience that marks Specters with a seal of quality. Now that he's gathered up old comrades and cohorts (members of This et Al, These Monsters and Grammatics amongst them), Stalking Horse appears to be the sound of a man capitalising on healed wounds and a fresh self-sufficiency."}
{"text":"Five Best Things: Records by Telepathe, The Fly Girlz, Fever Ray and PJ Harvey & John Parish\n\nA sort of sister column to \"All Time Top Five,\" \"Five Best Things\" is just that. Actually, it's more like \"Five Semi-Cogent Thoughts About Various Records, Movies, and Books of a Recent Ilk,\" but that doesn't look as good in our Categories list. God! Life, why do you always demand convenience?!!\n\nTelepathe, Dance Mother\n\n1. Brooklyn, represent! There is this weird strain of music coming out of there that is very world-music-y, quasi-urban hippie stuff. This is not really that, despite what the title might make you believe. It's very much on the dark synth-y tip, albeit a very shambolic, rambly version of that. So maybe it is a little world-music-y than I thought.\n\n2. The Brooklyn pedigree is pretty solid, however: this was produced by Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio, and Telepathe are often in the same sentence as Gang Gang Dance and other noiseniks. They're a bit more pop, though in a very left-field way.\n\n2. I actually went on a run recently with this on my headphones and it worked out quite well. It has a energetic yet soothing energy, so it musically fueled my athletic endeavor while at the same time quelling my desire to shoot myself for ever thinking that running was an enjoyable activity.\n\n3. That said, it is hard-pressed for me to pick out a \"stand out track,\" except for maybe the first one (\"So Fine\"). I know it's not cool to write classic pop songs anymore, but I was hoping there'd be a sort of \"mix tape must-have\" track on here. The songs kind of exist at the same register (or musically speaking, in the same key) for much of the album, making it blend together. It gets a little wallpaper-y, but that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're looking to just throw something on and do something else or go shopping at Urban Outfitters.\n\n4. Still, we are in favor of cool girls doing cool things with instruments, and there is a lot of cool here. I would love to see Telepathe a bit less cool and a bit more silly their next time out. I think they could do that way well. Telepathe, get effin' down, get that bass pumpin' all up in yr shit, dudes!\n\nThe Fly Girlz, Da Brats From Da'Ville (Sockets; 2009)\n\n1. The Fly Girlz are these girl MCs from Brooklyn between the ages of 12 and 14 who are holding fast onto their dreams in the midst of stupid school and boy problems. Man, I can relate, even being like two and a half times their age.\n\n2. This record is produced by a dude from that electropunk band, Excepter, who makes kinda toughie and sinister beats that the girls chatter and jive over. So it's not like straight hip-hop or even retro hip-hop. It's just kind of fucked up-sounding electronic bleeps and stuff.\n\n3. This whole enchilada is like a super-hot mess. It's like the producer got drunk and broke the drum machine and the girls are joking around and rapping over the whole melee while on the world's biggest sugar high. A lot of the songs start out like they're going to be normal songs but then they kind of fall apart and get chaotic and noisy. It walks the line between a weird conceptual art project and a broken boom box-cum-time-machine. How did these two entities hook up? I must know!\n\n4. I love their very pro-positivity, pro-\"stay in school\" message. These girls are really sassy and fun, and they've got charm in spades. I wouldn't mind being stuck on a bus with the Fly Girlz; they'd probably be super-hilarious to hang out with. They tell it like it is. Take a listen to \"Born 2 B Fly\"; it's the truest thing you will ever hear in your life!\n\n5. Dudes, the record cover is the most awesome thing I've seen in a long, long time.\n\nFever Ray, Fever Ray (Mute; 2009)\n\n1. Fever Ray is Karin from the Knife's solo record, and it is both the perfect continuation of that work and a wonderful jumping-off point into a new direction. I really loved the Knife; they were the perfect combination of darkness, leavened with a dry sense of humor that keeps things unpredictable. All those elements are still here, but they're rendered a bit more gently.\n\n2. If the Knife's epically amazing Silent Shout was influenced by house (albeit a very dark form of house music), then Fever Ray is more highly indebted to 90s ambient. It's not as dance-y, but in a way it's more emotionally accessible and less opaque thematically -- the thoroughlines of the songs are more traceable, so to speak.\n\n3. If you liked the whole weird demon-vocal thing the Knife had going for them, then this is totally up your alley because Karin still processes the high holy shit out of her vocals. The effect is not like talking to your animal familiar, or your alter ego, or a schizophrenic. These are all really fascinating and artful effects.\n\n4. Have you seen the video for \"If I Had A Heart\"? It's soooooo creepy!\n\n5. The record is kind of really great for late-night writing, especially if you are working on a thriller or horror movie screenplay. It's slightly perverse for a makeout record or a getting-ready-to-go-out record, but it could work for those if you really wanted it to. I have listened to Fever Ray about a million times already and really, really, really dig it. It's kinda just good.\n\nPJ Harvey & John Parish, A Woman A Man Walked By (Island, 2009)\n\n1. I really think Polly Jean Harvey is a musical auteur of the highest order; she's sort of unparelleled in terms of raw musicianship, classically great rock songwriting and emotional range and honesty. So it's interesting when she cedes many of her strengths to her longtime musical collaborator and concentrates on just singing and lyrics.\n\n2. Don't let the opener, the dirge-stomper \"Black Hearted Love,\" mislead you; the album is pretty avant-weird in many parts. John Parish has a garishly precise way of playing bluesy-yet-Thurston-y type of guitar; there's a bite to his tone, and it seems to bring out some equally caustic song structuring. It's like, \"Ooh, we're going to go into a real awesome riff here...NO, WE WILL DENY YOU PLEASURE!\" But there's a real howler of a track, \"Pig Will Not,\" where Peej goes basically apeshit tantrum-y in the best way possible. I am going to play it at my wedding. Joke! Or is it?\n\n3. That said, there are some way gorgeous songs here as well. Most of the songs have a spooky beauty, making them revved-up continuations of White Chalk. But the closing pair of songs (\"Passionless, Pointless\" and \"Cracks in the Canvas\") sound like they're practically mist-covered, so delicate and fragile they are.\n\n4. Letting Polly just focus on words actually doesn't seem to have much of an impact on her songwriting; she's always been a really concise lyricist, able to combine storytelling with word sculpture. But letting her just chanteuse her heart out is pretty incredible; you can feel her emotional and vocal range stretching to the extremes, and it should be pretty exciting to hear what her next record will be like.\n\n5. All that said, I really miss Polly on guitar and main songwriting duties. Parish is good, but you can tell he's more of an intellectual musician. And while the songs and music are often interesting, they're not as visceral or direct as Polly on her own. This sort of smartypants quasi-blues rock is nice enough, but when you know a musician like PJ Harvey is capable of grabbing you by the throat and ripping your guts out, you really just want to let her unleash herself. Polly, just let yourself balls-out rock!"}
{"text":"Profile Information\n\nLocation:\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nRelationship Status:\n\nIt's Complicated\n\nBio:\n\nLet's gloss over the perfunctory historical information. Mondo Topless was formed in 1992. One of the benefits to being around so long is that someone went to the trouble of creating a Wikipedia entry. So if you want all the details (and an exhaustive listing of all the former members of the band), you can go there.\n\nThat being said, let's fast-forward to 2010, shall we?\n\nWhile recording the songs that would comprise \"Freaking Out\", the newest album from Philadelphia garage veterans Mondo Topless, guitarist Kris Alutius remarked, \"This is gonna turn the garage world on its ear.\" One thing is for sure: \"Freaking Out\", their 3rd album on Get Hip (following \"Go Fast!\" and \"Take it Slow\") and 5th overall, is unlike any other release they've had in their long history.\n\nShortly after bringing new drummer Steve Thrash into the fold, they decided to augment their set list with a couple of covers that they thought would be fun to play. Before they knew it, they had built themselves a healthy repertoire of \"new\" songs - some recognizable, some not so well known, and still others that seem to defy description, at least in the \"garage purist\" sense.\n\nThe band challenged themselves to put their own unique twist on each of these songs, making them their own, while retaining their original spirit. Sure, all the basic garage elements are there: fuzz guitar, snotty vocals, cheesy organ\u2026 but there's something else, something more.

{"text":"Dusted Features\n\nDestined: Fireball\n\n2005 was a lot of things to a lot of people (aren't they all?), but from any perspective it was a heavy year. Politically, things stayed blanketed in basic Bush bleakness, while musically it was the year Sunn 0))) became a household name, and Boris' collective discography went gold (practically). Maybe the two phenomena are linked? Or maybe they're not. It could be just a healthy return to the original vision of rock as a force of crushing destruction. In any event, 2005 was a fitting year for burning Brooklyn quintet Fireball to be birthed.\n\nDespite all the headline-grabbing talk of over-driven amplifier fire, witch\/Wiccan lust lyrics, and occult pentagram album art, Fireball's origins are anticlimactically whimsical. According to mundane local lore (i.e. - MySpace), Jennifer Black (vocals), Rebecca Ross (guitar), Lisa Garrett (more guitar), Etain Fitzpatrick (bass), and Sue Piechalski (drums) actually formed the band because they were \"persuaded to\" by two mutual male friends, Fitz and Erik. The allegedly \"light-hearted talk\" regarding their shared adoration of progressive psychedelic music somehow led to the ladies agreeing to perform a \"fun, one-time project.\" This project was Fireball.\n\nThen, or so the story goes, they played the show (a January 28th closing party for the beloved NY space Mighty Robot), and everybody in earshot (and eyesight?) was floored by the potent magic of their alchemy. Five charismatic young women pummeling out Sabbath-style, in-the-red stoner pop \u2013 like The Runaways for the Southern Lord set. The purely conceptual metal-boogie party band had accidentally stumbled on to something real, something worth pursuing. So they did. A couple of key NYC shows later Fireball were approached by a friend, Andrew (no last names), with access to and knowledge of studio equipment. He proposed they make a record. The tracks became Blessed Be, their debut 12\", which sparked a firestorm of glowing critical acclaim and mentions in scores of widely-read year-end top ten lists (Dusted Magazine among them). Most of the praise has focused heavily on Fireball's evident sonic debt to the James Gang\/Hawkwind axis of good-times cosmic devil-rock, but their own words on the record are oddly dead-pan and mannered: \"We wanted to see how much dirt we could kick in the fire without putting it out. We believe the result is sacred and ever-burning, a phosphorescent testicular mammogram for which we stand proud.\" Which is to say, they like it, because it rocks.\n\nLike a lot of unique records, the rarest virtue of Blessed Be may be its distinct production quality, more than even the songs themselves. Everything is totally blown-out and overdriven, giving the impression that every track was recorded at some unimaginably deafening volume. The guitars shred and melt, the drums lumber like 16-rpm Zeppelin, and Jennifer Black's vocals burn slowly up out of the fire, consumed in the heat of it all. Fortunately, the production decision was a deliberate one, and whoever masterminded the idea definitely deserves a fair share of credit, as it transforms what could be regular, riff-driven rock songs into unholy, phoenix-rising psych-storms.\n\nFireball claim they have no current peers, but they confess a kinship with a diverse lineage of wild out-rockers, ranging from the predictably heavy (High on Fire, Comets on Fire, Dead Moon) to the unusually fringe (Woods, Rusted Shut, The Boredoms). Some of these make sense (all the 'fire' bands), and others don't, but it's nice to know Fireball's influences\/ambitions extend beyond devil-horns and loud rock and roll. Sort of. Actually, they allege to have just four goals, but only half of these seem at all easily accomplished: one, to make more records; two, to buy more records; three, to further blur the line between good and evil; and four, to meet the devil. Here's to hoping the focus stays on number one."}
{"text":"Bowerbirds\n\nRaleigh, NC\n\nFor the Triangle's Bowerbirds, it's all about the little things\u2014a solitary piano note, a gentle cymbal crash, the breath between words.The group's not one for grand gestures, opting instead to instill their folk-flavored songs with an austere honesty. When Phil Moore and Beth Tacular sing, they carefully navigate both what they say and how it's said.It's how a seemingly simple line like \"All I want is your eyes\/ in the moment that we wake\/ for a short while\" can become infused with a palpable, plaintive desire.And it's how \"In Our Talons,\" from their full-length debut Hymns For A Dark Horse, can be winsome and foreboding at the same time.\n\nThis painstaking care extends into their music. Listen for the way an electric piano can enter a song sounding unlike itself and still feel like it belongs where it is. Listen how a song can effortlessly shift from a gentle strummy gait to a pensive, trembling quiver.\n\nIn an interview with the Independent, Moore commented that the trained ear should notice that their second album, Upper Air, was recorded on GarageBand. It's a testament to Bowerbirds' skill as musicians and songwriters that their music sounds like something that was made in the outdoors, under the auspices of rustling leaves and swaying boughs, carried by the wind. \u2014David Raposa"}
{"text":"Shortly prior to the release of their fifth studio album Synthetica, Metric releases an early audio impression in the shape of the energetic tune \"Speed The Collapse.\" According frontwoman Emily Haines, the forthcoming LP has one special purpose:\n\n\"Synthetica is about staying home and wanting to crawl out of your skin from the lack of external stimulation...about forcing yourself to confront what you see in the mirror when you finally stand still long enough to catch a reflection...about being able to identify the original in a long line of reproductions.

The transitions from song to song could've been smoother, but I forgot about that when I heard the cheerful \"I Just Can't,\" the too-happy-to-be-a-breakup-song breakup song that made me smile and think MXPX.\n\nOverall, Makin' Moves is tight.

{"text":"Tag Archives: pearl jam\n\nWhen I heard that Eddie Vedder had released a new album using nothing but a ukelele and his phenominal voice I had pretty mixed expectations. It was the first album associated with Pearl Jam that had been brought to my attention in over a decade. I don't know what prompted me to never buy Riot Act, because I loved Binaural, but by 2011 they'd dropped so far off my radar that I didn't even know the self-titled and Backspacer existed until a few months ago. I made the mistake of jumping immediately to Backspacer without hearing their prior two and was so annoyed by the trendiness of it\u2013that incorporation of a somewhat 80s sound that's all the deplorable rage now\u2013that I couldn't make it through one listen.\n\nCan't Keep\n\nSo Ukelele Songs was in a pretty good position to impress me, really. I knew Eddie Vedder could do better than what I'd so recently heard on Backspacer, I knew the small scope of his instrument of choice would force him to get pretty creative, and at the same time I was already mildly disappointed going into it, so a poor output wouldn't have been any sort of heartbreak. As it turns out, what he created here is definitely worthy of attention. This may be no Bob Dylan or The Tallest Man on Earth, but as acoustic solo albums go it's well above average.\n\nThe first track, Can't Keep, is the most abrasive song on the album. Offering it up first might seem an odd decision. It definitely doesn't set the mood\u2013that's something you'll pick up further in. But it does quickly and definitively do away with any stereotype of the ukelele as a Hawaiian novelty toy.\n\nGoodbye\n\nSo as he goes on to apply the instrument a bit more traditionally throughout the rest of the album you never second guess his decision to limit himself to it; If he wanted to do something more aggressive he certainly could. Goodbye is one of my favorite examples of what you're more likely to encounter further in. Most of the tracks are sort of like this, little subdued 2 minute laments reminiscent of Soon Forget on Binaural. They might start to fade together after a while if you don't pay close attention, but if you do you'll find he continues to put the instrument to pretty diverse ends even as he's maintaining the same general mood.\n\nYou're True\n\nThe song that stands out most to me is similar to the opener in that it's a lot more powerful than the rest of the album, and it really highlights how beautifully Vedder can still sing in the absence of rock and roll. If the entire album had as much emotion packed into it as this one it would be destined for fame. Unfortunately, You're True doesn't have much competition there. The rest of the album isn't so much moving as just calmly pleasant.\n\nTonight You Belong To Me\n\nChan Marshall of Cat Power fame makes an appearance on the second to last track, a traditional piece dating back to 1926, marking my other favorite song on the album and the opposite extreme of You're True. If you think of Ukelele Songs' sixteen short tracks as all falling somewhere in between these two, you'll have an idea of what to expect. It's an unusual and pleasant little work that won't disappoint, at least so long as you're expecting what the album title implies and not Pearl Jam. A little too calm and lyrically simplistic to make waves as a folk album, it's something you're probably only going to like if you like Eddie Vedder's voice, but I imagine most people do.\n\nYeah, nothing earth-shattering here, but it makes me smile, and ever since I picked it up I've been on a 90s rock binge, despite of the grand distance between this and the likes of say, Ten or Vs. Vedder's vocal sound is so unique that you can't help but make the connection."}

{"text":"Review\n\nIf Nelly Furtado's Folklore proved anything is that mainstream pop audiences (and sadly, most critics) don't accept change from pop divas and just want them to sing five different versions of their breakthrough hit. And yet in recent history there have been examples of Pop Queens changing their sound and embracing maturity with succesful results. Two shining examples of this type of album are Madonna's Ray of Light and Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope, which may not have been the hit machines some of these women's previous albums were but still reached the top of the charts and were heralded by critics as milestones in their careers.\nFolklore shares much with both the first in that their creators have just given birth and the latter in that an overall sense of depression and nostalgia pervade the albums. But while Madonna got praised for singing about her daughter and the disillusionment of fame, for some inexplicable reason Nelly Furtado was considered, in raising those issues,to be ''whining'' and was labeled as an example of the \"sophomore jinx''.\nThe album opens with the great \"One Trick Pony'', which begins with a sweeping string section, courtesy of the Kronos Quartet, and sudennly breaks into a danceable banjo-and-violin interchanging with Nelly Furtado singing that she isn't indeed a one-hit wonder. In the wake of the album's flop, such a statement seems ironic and by turns sad, considering everything on this disc suggests that Furtado could have been a formiddable pop artist and a successful one, without having to turn to uber-producer\/hitmaker Timbaland and compromising her inimitable sound.\nOne of the most common criticisms of the album was that it lacked the playfulness of her -also great- debut Whoa,Nelly! and while that point is valid,-since most of Folklore is comprised of ballads- there is a number of potentially hit-worthy singles, such as the India-influenced \"Powerless\" or ''Fresh off the boat'', which recalls her debut in its combination of rapping and guitar licks, coupled with a super-catchy chorus. Elsewhere, folk instruments set against a traditional pop setting make for a unique listen that is enhanced by the album's pristine-clear production of sweeping sunthesizers, breakbeats and surprising sound effects.\nWhat keeps the album from being superb, though, is that, admittedly, the aforementioned ballads drag the album a bit, especially during the second half, even if some of them are better than anything Bryan Adams has ever sung: the album's centerpiece \"Try\" starts with a muted guitar and evolves into a lush, piano-driven chorus with moving lyrics('And I see you standing there\/Wanting more from me\/And all I can do is try'), whereas the perfectly placed \"Childhood Dreams\", a 6-minute ode to her daughter, recorded inside a church, closes the album on a euphoric note.\nAll that remains, in retrospect, is one of the decade's best pop albums and a tragically overlooked affair, which stands as a sad victim of our society's bizzare notion that thoughtful songwriting coming from a woman in her late 30s is called maturity, whereas coming from a 24-year old girl is somehow called self-indulgence."}

Their latest album, \"El Camino,\" is amazing\u2014and was pretty much on repeat in my rental car and on the bus all through Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. (\"Stop Stop\" is just awesome.) But today, we're in Ohio, where the band is from, and it's gloomy and foggy, so I've been listening to their moodier stuff, including \"She's Long Gone.\""}
{"text":"Southern Shores is sonic optimism. Every song is scrubbed clean. The clarity is refreshing. Little details can be heard so nicely. Pop hasn't been this happy for a while. 'New World' contains as much happiness as its short running time allows. Wordless songs begin the album, filled with crisp bits of early 90s pop dance pieces. Bands like 'Saint Etienne' and others are an obvious influence to these melodies and approaches. Percussion-wise it uses the barest of elements to propel these song.\n\nInnocence is the main theme throughout these songs. Twee is effectively mixed with the dance elements to create a child-like sense of wonder with the world. At times this can be an overdose of sweetness but generally it is endearing. 'Marazul' embodies much of what follows it: generally wordless as it builds itself into an efficient little song. 'Breathe' gives off the impression of a trance-pop song left alone for too long. It captures the sound particularly well, down to the keyboard sound. 'Sankasa' possesses the greatest sense of calm as the song takes its time. Eventually it transforms into a strange sing-along. 'Flashes' is probably the sweetest track on here. Heavy pitch modifications make it similar to a lot of takes on modern pop music. Plus the melody adds to this sense of tribute.\n\nThis is a lot of happiness to take in for one sitting. It is unified. Songs flow into each other. Sunshine is in each one of these bright, joyful pieces."}
{"text":"AAJ: Before I mention a single piece from the new album, I want to say that this is one of the albumy-est albums I've heard in a long time; I really hear it as one continuous musical experience\u2014a journey of sorts into some deep area and maybe a reemergence back out. Did you conceive this as a single body of work?\n\nCT: Yeah, that's the way we really thought about it\u2014like a collage. It's this single piece of all these different elements. Originally we were actually going to have one track, and that was going to be forty minutes long. We decided it'd be better to break it up a little bit and have the different tracks. It really is a record that we would like people just to listen to from the beginning to the end rather than listen to individual tracks, because that's the way we sort of put it together.\n\nRM: Actually, I think almost all our records\u2014for me, almost all the Duo records\u2014have been conceived as a whole, as parts of a whole. I don't know who these people are, but it seems like critics criticize us for the fact that perhaps on a given track, there isn't enough development in something, whether it's a minimalist piece or some kind of improvisation or even written pieces. For me, the development is the entire record.\n\nSo yeah, I think it's consciously thought of on all four of the records. Certainly on this one; maybe this one even more. When we started the recording of this record, we had quite a few songs that we had played for two years live that we had intentions of recording. It turns out we didn't use any of that material at all. We ended up improvising and coming up with brand-new ideas and that's how the record came to be. But it was certainly meant to be one continuous flow.\n\nAAJ: This record really feels live to me. I don't hear a lot of overdubbing and suspect a lot of it was done in real time, just the two of you playing. Is this true?\n\nRM: Yes. I think almost all the tunes were not overdubbed\u2014I think on one of the songs I added one pretty subtle cornet thing with ring modulator. But everything else, yeah, like the second cut, the long title track, is actually one continuous improvisation. And most of them were first takes. Chad plays vibes and drum set together; even on \"In Praise of Shadows, there were no overdubs. I was playing keyboard stuff\u2014harpsichord, celeste and piano at the same time, and I had my trumpet there too, so that's why you don't hear those instruments when I'm playing the cornet. I think 90% of it was no overdubs and over half must be one-takes.\n\nI mean, to me that means nothing. People seem to enjoy knowing those things. \"Oh, it's one take. That's amazing. I was listening to that trumpet player, Arve Henriksen. He did a solo trumpet record based on Japanese flower gardens. But it seemed like they kind of went out of their way to say that there were no overdubs on it. And I think Chad is pretty proud of that too. Maybe it's a matter of information because a lot of people think he overdubs stuff\u2014the vibes lines\u2014but he doesn't.\n\nBut it doesn't matter to me if it's one take or fifty takes or if it's completely chopped up. To me, it's the end result. The reason why it gets archived on some kind of thing you can hear back is because it sounds the way we want it to sound.\n\nAAJ: I don't think this is the jazziest record, whatever that means these days, but I like how it gives this feeling that the two of you are just making music without worrying about what kind of music it is. I hear African and so-called world music influences, but I never get the impression you're thinking about that beforehand.\n\nCT: Yeah, well, that's correct. I think what we were thinking about was just the sound of the different elements of the record. It's a lot of different-sounding things. We were thinking about that more than, say, \"we're going to go from this style to this style. We just wanted a lot of different sounds\u2014and for it to feel organic too. The one thing that was sort of challenging with this record is that the compositions were not dealing with harmony or melody. The last several records we did had some really strong melodies, but with this record, it's just these little pieces and they're mostly dealing with sound, rhythm, color and texture. Just the bare elements, so it was challenging to put that together.\n\nRM: The only thing that happens is, of course, that when we step into the studio we bring our own experiences in there. I think Chad happened to be checking out quite a bit of mbira music of, I think, northwest Africa, before we went in, but it wasn't like, \"oh, let's do a northwest African mbira piece. It was more like, \"let's try this thing I've been working on.\n\nSo he was interested; he put the mbira on his floor tom, which gave this eerie kind of reverb and stuff to it, and then we did quite a bit of post-production, although the post-production is very subtle. It still sounds exactly like an mbira. But the point is we never do say, \"oh, let's do a jazz tune, let's do something with an African rhythm.\n\nFor some reason, ever since the first record, 12 Degrees of Freedom, we've been able to just exist in a space musically\u2014and not musically, at times\u2014with the real freedom of just being able to make sounds. I don't even know if it's music sometimes; I use the word \"sound a lot, because sometimes what people consider music, whether it's melody or rhythm or harmony or whatever\u2014sometimes this music doesn't have any of that."}
{"text":"ada's debut album, Puzzle, was a substantial success and had critics billing them as a promising new addition to the alternative rock scene. The follow-up album feels like exactly that, a follow-up. Coming as a disappointment to many who were awaiting its arrival, American Highway Flower lacks the memorable songs that made Puzzle a hit. Less effective lyrics and more generic composition make it seem like a forced attempt to maintain momentum. Fortunately, Dada is talented enough to remain interesting and even just more of the same is worth listening to. As agile musicians, they still sound bigger than a three-man band. Their disciplined use of harmony is a rare find in the alt-rock world, and continues to define their sound. The album is a bit heavier at times, with \"Feet to the Sun\" and \"Pretty Girls Make Graves\" as its strongest tracks. While somewhat of a letdown, American Highway Flower does little to diminish Dada's potential. They are still a band worth watching."}

One suspects there's only a minimum of musicians playing, because Boo Frog clearly understand the way silence and the space between the silences can unsettle. There's no bass. Why would there be? Why would there be? Reverb, as ever, is their queen and castle and legacy and floating jetsam pushing aside the barges of woe.\n\n\u2026This seems like everything The Racounteurs could be, but are not in any shape or form.

{"text":"Album Details\n\nNot often when I place an album into my stereo's tray, press play, lie down on my bed, and absorb the music am I moved by the delicacy that is human emotion. Yes, I am able to comprehend the hurt, the love, the whatever that the high school graduate is trying to convey. It does hit me and I react. New Atlantic emotionally trucked me, though. Giovanni Gianni's voice is the height and epitome of the oral delivery of emotion. The lyrics are simple by nature but the syntax is so poetic and Gianni captures this and his voice is magical.\n\nThe Streets, The Sounds, The Perfect Album?\n\nNever before have I encountered a more cohesive album. From the opener, \"Cold-Hearted Town\" to the closing title track, you are carried across the flow of a gem. No debut has ever seemed so damn well constructed. \"Wire and Stone,\" the lead single, is one of the most powerful songs on the album and my arsenal of metaphors cannot figuratively describe how vibrant\"Safer Times\" is. There isn't a track that doesn't fit in. Each song is a puzzle piece, with the simplicity of a toddler's puzzle and the complexity as a puzzle of the clear blue sky, and each has its place and each is snug within that place."}
{"text":"Hey, dummy! Why aren't you listening to more soul music? Granted, if you're reading this review you were either at the Mayer Hawthorne show Tuesday night at the 9:30 Club, or you're my editor. Either way, you're probably already hip to what should be obvious, especially this coming summer: soul is back, and I cannot figure out where it went in the first place.\n\nThe show itself, was as always, whip smart. My last experience watching Hawthorne play was at the Black Cat. That show was grimier, with the band crammed on a stage half as large, in a room three times smaller. In the 9:30 Club, with his backing band clad in three piece suits and spread evenly across the stage, last night's show had the polish and refinement of a James Brown set\u2026 if Brown had been a goofy white guy in a crushed velvet jacket and bowtie. At one point, Mayer stopped the show so that his drummer could take a picture of him sitting in front of the audience, and then spent a full minute posing so that the audience could take pictures of him. There was a sort of carefree joy to everything that happened up on stage. No need to grind through the hits. Even the funkier moments, the Eddie Hazel-worthy guitar runs were light and playful, and the organ and drum work was suitably intense without weighing down the overall sound.\n\nIt's not like soul doesn't appeal to everyone. Walking around the room you could see middle aged couples slow dancing not 10 feet from kids grinding against one another. Everyone was getting down; even my rhythm-less ass can dance to the sweet, mellow-tempo'd music. If you don't get soul, it's likely you don't have a soul.\n\nI've always found myself partitioning soul music by which emotion is best expressed. Sexier soul borders on funk. Danceable soul approaches disco. The more electronic-tinged soul could very easily be a more complicated form of Chicago house. Reverent soul is often confused with gospel, which feels obvious considering the latter spawned the former. Mayer's flavor of neo-soul is practically effervescent, with its doo-wop harmonies and songs about love, he actually had to make a point to indicate when a song was ONLY about having sex.\n\nBut etymology aside, I'm not going to bore anyone (or further prove myself a fool) by trying to define soul music for anyone. I do know despite the overpowering influence on nearly every variation of popular music in the past 50 years, soul music is sadly underrated and overlooked, even after seeing Hawthorne play to a capacity crowd. This was a solid show, let no one say otherwise. And yet, I worry, even with the resurgence of soul in pop music, these shows are going to get fewer and farther between, no matter how popular Hawthorne's music becomes.\n\nSoul deserves better than to be permanently relegated to underground status. All I can do is beg and plead: buy a friend a Prince album. Listen to Janelle Monae. Get Bobby Womack's new album when it comes out in June (I can't begin to tell you how excited I am about this one). Demand to hear JC Brooks on the radio. Hell, even D'Angelo is touring again. You're doing something wrong f soul isn't the foundation of your jams this summer. Oh, and go see Mayer Hawthorne as soon as you can. Bring a dance partner."}

{"text":"For about a decade, brothers Jake and Jamin Orrall have been playing fuzzy, guitar-centric garage rock as JEFF the Brotherhood, releasing raw-sounding albums, usually recorded in three to four days, on their own Infinity Cat label. Later this month, they're releasing their major-label debut, Hypnotic Nights, which was produced by no less than the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach. It contains a few more keyboard tracks than usual and overall presents a more polished \u2014 but still unpredictable \u2014 take on the duo's signature sound. Part of that might have something to do with the fact they recorded this one in the space of a week.\n\nDespite such luxuries, the pair still enjoys the simple things in life. When we reached drummer Jamin, he said his biggest goals for the summer were swimming and canoeing with his friends \u2014 something he and vocalist-multi-instrumentalist Jake captured in their wild and NSFW video for the album's lead single, \"Sixpack.\" In it, they drink beer (duh), pass flasks, go skinny dipping and pass, uh, hand-rolled cigarettes to one another. It looks like a nice respite, but before long they'll be back on the road, touring in support of their record in their short bus, which Jamin says below is becoming more like home than ever before.\n\nOn your new album Hypnotic Nights, the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach produced. What did he bring most to the album?\n\nThe main thing was the sounds that we got for the record. He helped us a lot with song structure, changing things. He was almost like this living advice column or something. He brought another point of view, which we've never had. When it's just the two of us, we get really super deep and into it and don't come out of our own heads. There's never any perspective, so you never know what could have been different or what could have been better. Dan helped us with that.\n\nYour video for the song \"Sixpack\" just came out. It looks like it was fun to make.\n\nIt's pretty funny. We got a bunch of our friends to come with us to the river, which is what we normally do in the summer. We just filmed it this time. The song is about going to the river and canoeing.\n\nHas having a song called \"Sixpack\" encouraged people to buy you more beers?\n\n[Laughs] People always try to buy us beers. At a show recently, some kid brought a six-pack of homemade beer in this case that just said \"Sixpack\" on it, and that was kind of strange. But that was kind of cool. People try to get us to shotgun beers pretty often, but I hate doing it. [Laughs]\n\nHow was the homemade beer?\n\nI didn't try it. People bring you stuff and you never know what's really in it. Actually, this woman brought some weed caramel popcorn to one of our shows and I tried that. That was really good.\n\nWhat inspired the song \"Staring at the Wall\"?\n\nA lot of the songs, I can't talk about what they're about, because it's personal with Jake. And he won't talk about it either. But you can ask me more questions about that song and I'll just try to answer them.\n\nWhy is it about staring at the wall in the first place?\n\nWell, that's just something everybody does. Everybody can relate to that. It's just a good thing to write a song about. There are definitely dark events that inspired that, but I can't talk about them. Jake won't either.\n\nWatch the video for \"Sixpack\" here:\n\nWhy did a very synth-heavy cover of Black Sabbath's \"Changes\" make the album?\n\nWell, it sounds kind of cheesy but there are a lot of changes going on with us. We wanted to do that song because it kind of sums up where we're at with our musical path. We signed with Warner Bros., and our music style is changing a little. We're playing in new places and stuff in our lives is changing around. It's all good stuff, but we really like that song.\n\nIt was Jake's idea. He kind of did the whole thing when me, Dan and Colin, the engineer, went out to lunch. When we got back he had pretty much done the whole thing. I knew he was going to do it with loops and the vocals. There are probably going to be a lot of synths on the next record, so this was kind of a segue.\n\nYou approached it pretty differently from the original.\n\nWe wouldn't dare ever cover a normal Black Sabbath song. They're all too perfect. I would only be disappointed hearing a cover of a Black Sabbath song. There's no way to make it better. I think we tried to do a good job on \"Changes,\" because it's not their normal sound. There was more to play around with.\n\nDid you record any other covers?\n\nWe didn't do any other covers in that session, but we're about to put out a seven-inch on our label, Infinity Cat, of a Hole cover that we did. We picked \"Turpentine.\" That's the song to do. And we also have a cover song coming out on a Nick Lowe tribute album, \"Marie Provost,\" off his Jesus of Cool album. It's a really hard song to cover, because it's so well done already.\n\nLastly, you've recently been touring in a short school bus. Why is that?\n\nWe've been touring in it for the last three tours, so about four months. We had a van and we wanted something bigger, because we had more gear, because Jake keeps getting more amps. It's really annoying, but it's his thing, I guess.\n\nWe had a school bus a long time ago that Jake converted to run on vegetable oil, but the transmission went out and we didn't have any money so we just got rid of it. This one we bought from a daycare and ripped all the seats out. Jake and I built a loft bed and a couch in it to make it more like an RV. It gets really bad gas mileage but it's nice. It's like a house. You can sleep in it most of the time if the weather's right. There's no AC, but you can get a good cross breeze if you open the windows and the hatch in the top.\n\nHypnotic Nights is out July 17 on Warner Bros.Stream a four-song sampler EP here:"}

{"text":"Review\n\nReview Summary: Ladies and gentlemen, do you leave the house with only one shoe tied? Are you content with your catfish for dinner being mostly raw? Do you pride yourself on only making the right side of the bed? If so, then Loop's for you!\n\nBenjamin Sharp stands out in the do-it-yourself music scene as a chameleon, an ever-changing musician basking in the versatility of his discography. One look at \"Let Yourself Be Huge\" after studying his much more calculated, riff-sporting earlier releases indicates that he's most comfortable creating something monumental and then leaving it in the dust, perhaps resurrecting it in nondescript ways in the future but never more. Yes, his past widely alters his musical future, but Cloudkicker is one musician with a wide array of influences, and a songwriter that aspires to be more universal than that of his peers.\n\nOne quality of Cloudkicker that certainly sets him apart from others in the instrumental genre is the steady influx of his music over only the past four years. Ever since the inception of \"The Map Is the Territory\" in 2008 he's since released so many full-lengths and EPs that his aspirations have propelled him to the forefront of the independent music scene. Unlike other obscenely proficient musicians probably named Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, Sharp never feels the need to release albums that he doesn't truly find himself satisfied with at the end of the day. Well, until Loop.\n\nLoop is quite the mystery, and why exactly it was released is the one question that eludes me. Sure, it's kind of alright in some places, but mostly it's an irritating listen just because it lacks the persistent polish that Sharp has always made sure to apply to his releases. The restraint is coated much too thin on Loop, every idea lodged in Sharp's mind surfaced unquestionably. This would be more acceptable if the ideas went somewhere, instead of tending to drone on for the song's length, but the intricate system of layering that makes Cloudkicker's music so enjoyable is entirely absent here. Instead Loop is a collection of sixteen riffs, lukewarm concepts that aren't really too capable of standing by themselves, and they're left twisting in the wind.\n\nIt's also tragic how little time each track is given to flourish, because it feels as if once they truly start to get going the track ends. This leads to an immense lack of fulfillment all throughout Loop, a longing for at least an inkling of something more profound that's never sated. It's almost as if Sharp has lost the confidence he's always possessed, that self-assurance that's always granted him the ability to turn just that one sick groove into something truly special. He lacks the drive to take Loop further and is content with leaving the album in a state of only slight hints towards what could have been.\n\nLoop exists as a half-baked amalgamation of ideas that could have been very successful as actual songs, but remain as incomplete shimmers at what could have been. After all of the intensive labor Cloudkicker's placed into his other releases, the existence of this strange blip in Sharp's discography is a little mystifying. However, it's very assuring that this was released at the same time as Let Yourself Be Huge, indeed a huge step into a most rejuvenating style. This is perhaps to be disregarded more than anything, because although this was deemed important enough to be released, it's not at all indicative of the prowess of Cloudkicker lately. So while Loop isn't very good, let's keep in mind that at least these ideas are now disposed of, and Ben Sharp can let himself dive into a new project headfirst, and be even huger.\n\nI feel like the majority of this review is about Cloudkick's other releases, then you go onto saying why you don't like this without saying what it sounds like or giving any reasons besides the general.\n\nit doesnt really seem fair to judge this. it isn't supposed to be a proper album\/release, it's just something he put on the internet for the sake of giving people some stuff for free. i think he said himself somewhere that he gave away these loops to be used and manipulated by people who care to use them, for a bit of fun for themselves, rather than to be listened to by any critical audience. he said the \"album\" sounds better when listened-to with crossfade, so the fact that he didn't put it in crossfade when he uploaded it goes to show that it wasn't supposed to be listened to in the conventional sense.\n\ni dunno, just thought that was worth saying, in case people were judging this and worrying that he was losing his touch as a musician or something.\n\nMinty901, that's one thing I discussed in the review. It does need to be known that this release isn't necessarily a proper one of his, but I feel like he may want to put just a little more thought into what he does and doesn't release absolutely everything he makes. And I did make sure to talk in the review about how this isn't a reason for worry, that it wasn't his main focus at the time.\n\nAnd judging music isn't always to dissuade or persuade people to check it out - one always has to keep in mind what their personal tastes are. This release will be enjoyed by those that like messing around with loops on their guitars, and maybe adding onto the palette that Cloudkicker created here, but for a person like me that doesn't play too much guitar it's quite bare.\n\nyeah dont get me wrong it was a great review and you made all the right points. just something worth reiterating i guess. say if it was the 90s and he put all his music out in physical media, this wouldn't have seen the light of day because he knows it isn't worthwhile listening material. its only because he can so easily put stuff on the internet that hes put this out there for people to have if they want it.\n\neither way, good review, and ur right you did make the point about not to worry etc.\n\nThank you :] I guess that's one interesting topic, how much an artist should release when they're technically allowed to actually release. It tends to mean less when an artist releases a shit-ton of music. However, clearly Cloudkicker hasn't been bad about it, and he does maintain this air of intrigue about him, which I love. I feel like that's one thing missing from musicians' lives these days, because we can learn so much about their lives now. It's cool, but also worth being cautious about I guess."}

There's harshly distorted guitar and drum machine beats, New Order-ish hooks, and J&MC-ish vocals.\n\nActually, this sounds a lot closer to a few recent re-interpretations of the J&MC sound than J&MC proper. \"Someday\" sounds like the Magnetic Fields' \"Distortion\" album, but without the major label polish.
