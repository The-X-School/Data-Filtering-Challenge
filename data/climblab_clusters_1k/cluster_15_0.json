When the bomb fails to explode, he's left stranded in\nTel Aviv until he's able to fix the detonator. The entire movie takes\nplace during Tarek's weekend in Tel Aviv.\n\nDirector Zahavi pulls off a coup, in that he makes his protagonist's\nmission understandable. It's hard to think of an audience being\nsympathetic to a terrorist bomber, but we can at least understand the\ninternal logic behind Tarek's actions, even while we recoil at the\nthought of the suffering a terrorist bomb will cause.\n\nAdded to this volatile mixture is a young, liberated Israeli woman,\nKeren, played by the beautiful Israeli actor Hili Yalon. Naturally,\nthere's a chemistry between the young man and woman, although the\ndifferences that separate them make Romeo and Juliet's problems appear\ntrivial by comparison.\n\nIt's interesting that both Tarek and Keren are not cardboard\ncharacters.

{"text":"Rep Pick: Brief Encounter\n\nBrief Encounter (1945)\nDirected by David Lean\nMay 12 the Film Society of Lincoln Center's \"Coward on Film\"\n\nBrief Encounter is immortal, the kind of film you watched before you saw it the first time because you'd imagined it. David Lean's British film, adapted from No\u00ebl Coward's one-act play Still Life, takes as its center a maybe-love affair, in which two people spend as much time as they can together in person. All told, it isn't that much\u2014some time out in town, a trip to the cinema, a tea. But it seems like much more because there's another heard-but-not-seen film running alongside it, inside the constant head of the married woman (Celia Johnson), adulterous in thought, imagining in breathless voiceover everything that she and her possible lover could be. He's a stiff, slim doctor (Trevor Howard) with a strong sense of the moment, knows what's proper and improper in public. Her large eyes look towards him, and her face's flesh seems to rise. \"No, no, I don't want that time to come ever,\" she thinks. \"I want to remember every minute, always, always to the end of my days.\"\n\nThey're sitting at a table at the train station. \"We've still got a few minutes,\" he says, and then they're interrupted; a loud woman, an acquaintance, but still basically a stranger, sits at their table and starts chattering away. There's no way that she knows what they mean to each other\u2014how could she?\u2014and he stands up. There's been a terrible possibility floating quietly throughout the film, which is that two peoples' mutual belief isn't mutual at all: They might not mean the same to each other, each one's thoughts might be different from the other's, and that might be the real, deeper reason that they'll end up alone. We don't know what he thinks, just what she hopes he thinks. Time is passing, life changing. Then he softly places his hand on her shoulder, which here at this time can mean nothing, or worlds."}
{"text":"Code 46 is a complex science fiction musing set in the near future\nwhere the world population is separated by those living inside big\ncities and those poorer peoples living outside. The population is\ncontrolled by various codes and passwords, papers and authentications,\nviruses and corrective medical procedures.\nThe \"Code 46\" of the title is a bit of a spoiler for the\nstory, though no more than the lengthy written prologue that begins the\nfilm. It refers to the ban on offspring for\ngenetically matched parents, the result of an incestuous union, which\ncan be commonplace and unknown to the parents due to advancements in\nhuman cloning and in-vitro fertilization.\n\nTim Robbins (The Truth About Charlie,\nAntitrust) stars as William Geld, an investigator of insurance fraud\nsent to Shanghai to investigate the employees of a company that\nmanufactures cover papers of insurance for purported forgeries and\nsmuggling. His investigation leads him to Maria Gonzalez (Morton,In America), a young\nwoman he feels a connection to, which leads to him ending up protecting\nher rather than turning her in. Eventually, his empathy deepens to\nfeelings of fondness for the young woman, until the two unite.\nThis presents a problem for the inspector, as he finds himself\ncompromised as to his job, his marriage, and his ability to keep from\nbreaking the codes he is trying to uphold.\n\nDirected in somber but sumptuous fashion by Michael Winterbottom (A\nMighty Heart, 24 Hour Party People), the\nfuture setting of Code 46 isn't terribly different from our\nown, but it is more insular in its vision of people existing on a\ncity-wide basis, surrounded by glass and structure, relying on\nelectronic communications to continue to link each other globally.\nWinterbottom creates a very futuristic portrayal of a potential future\nusing not much more than pre-existing exotic-looking locales and\narchitecture in which to present his story. Steadicam and POV\ncamerawork add to the intimate and off-center mix of visuals.\n\nThe screenplay by Frank Cotrell Boyce (Hilary\nand Jackie, Millions) is intelligent, though a bit lean\non exposition. Despite the written prelude setting up the\nexplanation for what the world we're about to enter through the\nnarrative is like, much of what goes on in the story is inferred rather\nthan explained. While it's enjoyable to find a film that doesn't\ndumb everything down with over explanation, there will be moments,\nperhaps even long stretches, where things aren't really making sense.\nWhy do people in Shanghai speak Spanglish, for instance? Why such\na disparity between inside and outside living conditions, and what are\nthe distinguishing characteristics of the two? Why can't those on\nthe inside traverse into the daylight? Conjecture may lead to some\ninteresting theories, and that's part of the film's allure, but not\neveryone in the audience will be comfortable grasping for answers to\nbasic questions left off the screen.\n\nThe film is about the future of the world, without actually being about\nthe world. Rather, it's a commentary on the direction our current\nworld is heading from a technological, biological and multicultural\nstandpoint, but done through a more personal and intimate story of two\npeople who make a connection they aren't supposed to make -- is it right\nfor society to reduce love down to genetic matches and viruses?\nRobbins and Morton deliver strong performances, despite the fact that\nthe characters aren't fully shaded with details about their past and\ntheir motivation for what they do in the present.\n\nCode 46 feels like a close cousin to the futuristic vision as\nportrayed in such iconic science fiction films as Blade Runner\nor Gattaca, though with a more realistic approach to technology\nand societal evolution. What it does appear to be missing, which\nmay make some viewers lose interest, is a clear-cut conflict in the plot\nthrough which the rest of the story can wrap its themes around. In\nthe end, its an intriguing and beguiling vision of a potential future\nfor our world that's as fascinating as it is confusing.\nRecommended only for those who truly enjoy films that take some time and\nfocus to follow intellectually, even if it's emotionally disengaging."}

Most motorists will slow down to stare at the scene of a collision; they may feel their pulses quickening and become exquisitely aware of the fragility of their own bodies. The characters of Crash carry this awareness a step further, cherishing and nurturing it. For them, a car collision is a sexual turn-on, and a jolting life-force they come to crave.

{"text":"\"The question is that, in Japan, why do the police not stop their illegal activities? It is because the people are docile. It's not like in Korea, for example, where, if something happens, the people rise up and have demonstrations. Nothing like that has ever happened in Japan. So, even if I make a movie like this, the police won't come after me. It's not like the FBI in the United States would put out a hit on me or anything like that. Nothing like that would happen. And when I applied for documents like filming permits, they came through with no problems from the police. And one more important reason: basically, Japanese society doesn't care for filmmakers - especially for independent filmmakers. They look down on me as an independent filmmaker. Independent filmmakers like me seem to have no influence on society, and whatever I produce doesn't have a large effect on society at large. If it was a large studio like Toho, for example - and it actually happens that last year, they were planning a film similar to mine, and they were probably shut down by the police because, in a large company like Toho, there are former members of the police who have become executives in the corporation. The larger the company, the more likely a project like this is to be shut down.\"\n\nwhat kinda asshole sets out to make a 'work of art'? And I think 'mechanical' is a compliment, Soderbergh is like Kubrick, a chess player, precise, not monkeying around. His accuracy isn't artistic enough?\n\nEven with a complete divergence from his usual style, Teshigahara makes a very interesting picture on a zero budget. He works non-pro actors just as fine as an Italian Neorealist, and I dare anyone to find a better anti-war film made under the same conditions.\n\nI feel like there was a rupture between Abe's existentialism, a search for identity and meaning, and Teshigahara's style, which tends to alienate. He broke the line several times, sometimes even has half the frame obscured or out of focus, and on top of that there are those memorable psychedelic scenes. It's the only film in the partnership where I felt that the two didn't make love very well. But still...\n\n.... it's at least ten times more interesting than most of what was coming out of Japan at the time. I could compare it to a film of that year, say Okamoto's Kiru!, and well there's just no competition.\n\nEvery time you think KT is going to take his curious, roving camera away from an uncomfortable scene, he doesn't, and brings you to that next level of depravity, met with more discomfort, and then fascination. A good take on the Sadean philosophy.\n\nAs good as In the Realm of the Senses, probably better. Funny how you can get such a different approach from two different directors. I like this version for fleshing out the character of Abe Sada more. Oshima did not do a good job at making compelling characters in Ai no Corrida.

{"text":"Growing up to racial tensions, gang violence, hate crimes and all that negativity against one another. Heartbreaking.\nYes, it might seem like the typical teacher who comes to the class that seems hopeless, with the kids who don't seem to give a ****, then you'd roll your eyes thinking \"nothing original here\", but this movie was worth the watch. From the start, some message was being sent out, a reminder, and it felt real. So it didn't surprise me when I found out that this was based on a true story. It actually made it that more hopefully about us as people and what we are capable of doing. Looking past what society tells you to see, who to judge, what to do, change, this is possible. We can make it possible. And at the end of the day, being human, a person, it's skin deep. It's funny how sometimes were so focused on our differences that it we forget how were all just the same, trying to live in this world we happened to fall into. We all were born and were all gonna die, we just took different paths along the way, but I don't believe it makes anyone less better or worse then the other. Were all fighting our own battles but it's always nice to have someone stop and make you realize, your not alone in this.\nThis was truly an inspiring story."}
{"text":"Tag Archives: Super 8\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Back to the Future, Star Wars, and other like-minded pieces of Spielbergian entertainment, Super 8 is a film with a dirty little secret at its core- INCEST. But unlike those other films, in which the secret ain't so secret, Super 8 plays it subtle, choosing to shroud its aberrant sexuality in an air of mystery.\n\nAnd it's a better film for it. Long after the disappointment of the recycled Cloverfield monster is gone, you'll be all, \"Wait a minute\u2026\" and suddenly you're in love with Super 8 all over again. Forbidden love, that is, AKA the greatest love of all. (Take it away, Whitney!)\n\nEmbedding is disabled, but it's worth clicking the link. Trust me.\n\nLet me spell it out for the oblivious. When Louis Dainard crashes the funeral of Jackson Lamb's wife, it isn't solely because he feels responsible for her death- it's because HE LOVED HER. They were having an affair, and, as you can imagine, that shit burned Jackson's ass.\n\nNot only that, the lovely Alice Dainard, who is the object of young Joe Lamb's affection, is obviously a byproduct of their monkey-coupling. So you can see why Dad A and Dad B would want to keep those crazy kids as far away from each other as humanly possible. The two men hate each other as it is; neither of them wants to assume joint custody of an inbred retard baby and be forced to live out their lives like some sort of comically mismatched sitcom duo.\n\nNeed more proof? You know the scene where Alice cries while watching the filmstrip of Joe's dead mom? That's because IT'S HER MOTHER TOO. But she isn't crying tears of sadness. No, those are tears of frustration. Because in that moment she begins to understand that the world will never accept the unholy love she has for her brother.\n\nBut all is not lost, for this perverted tale ends on a glimmer of hope. During the final scene, in which Joe lets go of his mother's locket, he is really letting go of his shared lineage with Alice. They no longer have a mother, because her memory was needed to fuel a space alien's rocket ship. The two lovebirds are flanked by their fathers, who have come to terms with being a non-gay couple raising a pair of incestuous siblings. It signifies a new era of the American family, and is a great victory for love.\n\nAt least that's my interpretation, which is a hell of a lot more interesting than what actually happens in Man-eating E.T. Vs. The Goonies."}
{"text":"Movie Mom\n\nInterview: John Hillcoat of 'The Road'\n\nI spoke to John Hillcoat, director of the apocalyptic new film, \"The Road,\" based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy. We do not know what caused the cataclysmic damage that has wiped out most forms of life on earth and left everything covered in ash. All we know is that there is a father (Viggo Mortensen) trying to protect his young son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) from the physical and spiritual consequences of the devastation.\n\nNM: Do you see this as a spiritual film?\n\nJH: It can definitely be read that way. Yes, absolutely. I never wanted to be heavy-handed about the approach. I wanted it to be open to interpretation according to your own belief systems. It's certainly got a kind of ancient, Biblical parable feeling to it. There's a morality tale there. But in terms of essence of humanity, that's really brought to the fore because everything's stripped bare. There's nowhere to hide. So it definitely has those dimensions to it. There are many spiritual aspects, but the whole idea of carrying the fire is an ancient one.\n\nNM: I do not diminish the power of the film at all when I say that it seems like an exaggerated version of what every parent goes through in trying to both protect the children and give them the survival skills they will need when we are not here to protect them.\n\nJH: Yes, absolutely. Knowing Cormac and his son, he calls him \"Papa,\" like the boy in the story. It's obviously a personal work and that personal relationship is definitely embedded into the text and that's also why it strikes such a deep cord, even thought it is set into such an extreme scenario. There's a truth to it.\n\nNM: For me, one of the most wrenching scenes in the film is when they return to the house the father grew up in, and it is only there that the father truly realizes that his son has no frame of reference to understand what life was like.\n\nJH: Where does he learn? How does he become this amazing being? It's like a scientific experiment. That drive to keep going and the hope they create in this idea of going to the coast. Every parent starts from scratch, but this story just makes that more stark. Ultimately, the boy becomes the teacher. That is something all parents see.\n\nNM: I was very surprised to find Guy Pearce and Robert Duvall in the film. I did not recognize them at first.\n\nJH: We tried to quite change their appearance quite a lot.\n\nNM: The New York Times said that Kodi Smit-McPhee, the now-twelve-year-old who plays the boy, was so shocked by the cold water he was dunked in that he began to sob for real, but that he kept acting and you did not know how distressed he was until the scene was over. Is that true?\n\nJH: Yes. It was actually a real turning point, early on in the shoot. My job was also to protect the boy. But Kodi was such a consummate professional. He didn't tell anyone how cold he was. And afterward, we had an understanding that if there was any time that he felt real uncomfort that he's got to tell us. He was so determined to get the best for everyone and the best from him as a performance. The most incredible thing was his maturity; he really understood what the story was about, what each scene was about. His instincts were razor-sharp. And yet, as soon as we stopped filming, he became this kid, joking around, playing. And we really encouraged that.\n\nWith that scene, I was about to call cut, and then I heard the dialogue, and everyone's glancing around at each other, and we see that Viggo is actually responding totally. It's this incredible thing of being real, Viggo's concern for Kodi, and playing their parts. That was a great gift and I wouldn't mess with that. Luckily, we shot it on two cameras, so that was it. And when we were done, Viggo kept holding Kodi. None of us had put two and two together to realize why he was so upset. I had spoke to him about coming out of shock. Kodi's father was there; he played one of the cannibals. Viggo started to hand Kodi over to them but he stepped away. Kodi knew he was there but he and Viggo from that day had this incredible bond.\n\nNM: Tell me how you achieved the look of the film. It is so bleak and stark and powerful.\n\nJH: The spark for that came when I read the book. I was always trying to be true to the spirit of the book. Usually the post-apocalyptic films are about the big event and they feel so much like a spectacle and there's no real human dimension or spiritual dimension or any other dimension really other than the roller coaster ride. So it was that feeling of authenticity, really simple things like pushing the shopping trolley with all your possessions in it. That's the homeless in every city. And the dirty ski jackets. So it felt familiar. It's almost like I've seen this before, not as a vision or a premonition, but we've actually witnessed these elements, just not on a local scale. That is what led us to those locations, and the locations were the key to the look. The bulk of what we got was in camera. We filmed in the winter in places like Pennsylvania like where all the mining leftovers are, the ash piles in the winter time. Where are the trees are bare of leaves. We had the aging and the muted colors of the wardrobe. There's a strange beauty in these desolate locations. Then it also gave a real poignancy to working in a place like New Orleans, where the post-Katrina clean-up was still happening. When half your crew has lived through that, it really added focus. It also became something that the actors could really react off of, so it was like there was a third character working with Kodi and Viggo the whole time. We went to Mount St. Helens. We went to Oregon, the gray beaches. It was a patchwork tapestry of man-made and natural disasters that have already occurred. We added physical effects like spraying biodegradable ash and paper, but whatever we couldn't get in the camera, CGI took over to eliminate signs of life, green pine needles, birds, jet streams. It was more to take out or put in. The challenge was when it was beautiful blue skies and sunshine, because we had to block the sun. There's a shot of two ships sitting on a freeway. That's 70 mil. IMAX footage from two days after Katrina. We had to replace the blue sky and green grass in that shot, but everything else is real. Even the smoke billowing in the background we took from was from 9\/11. We deliberately used images we have all seen to make it more real and to give more poignancy and a warning sign and to surround it, because that's what the book is about, grace under pressure. When you're surrounded by your real fears, things that you know are possible in some way, it makes hope all the more special. The light shines brightest when it is surrounded by dark show"}
{"text":"Formula One is close to meaningless in America, but the longer you watch this movie the more you get hooked. By the spectacle, the racing, the athleticism. Ayrton Senna wins the Brazilian Grand Prix and passes out, it was just that much of an effort, just that draining. Walking through the crowd after coming back to, he keeps imploring people not to touch him, he's in that much pain. When you're a superstar, you're no longer beholden to your fans, you're beholden to your art. Which is why we never expect Van Morrison to tweet, why it's unnecessary for the Belfast Cowboy to be nice to his audience.\n\nAnd who knew Formula One was so political? You'll wince when the powers-that-be go against Ayrton, snatch away victory for a reason that's never been employed previously, despite being in the rule book. Making him start on the wrong side of the grid, even though he won pole position. In the Internet era, you get to do it for yourself, you can avoid the b.s. The younger generation has got no idea how freeing this is, the same way today's young women don't appreciate all the rights their mothers won for them back in the seventies.\n\nAnd it all comes down to the car. The greatest driver can't win if the wheels are bad. That's one of the unseen problems with so many sports. He who has the best equipment has a huge advantage. At the elite level, a small edge makes all the difference.\n\nAnd then we watched \"The Other F Word\". The movie about being a punk rock dad.\n\nWe needed to be cleansed after \"Senna\". Ayrton's so alive in the movie, yet so dead in real life.\n\nNot quite as watchable, I wish wannabes could see \"The Other F Word\". Because I've yet to see a film that depicts the tedium of the road so well.\n\nHere's the story. They were rebels living in SoCal beach towns. They played punk music not for tomorrow, but today. No one even believed there would be a tomorrow. And so many punk musicians never did make it.\n\nBut those who did\u2026\n\nNormalized. To a degree. They got married. Had kids.\n\nAnd now, to support their families, they've got to go on the road, hundreds of days a year. Not because they love it, but because they have to pay the bills.\n\nOne of the great scenes is when Jim Lindberg says you've got to hold your tongue. You're in some far-flung town and you've got to be nice to the audience when really all you're doing is counting the days until you can get back home, you're wasted, you're pissed, using drugs just to get by.\n\nLindberg's choice is Ambien. Yup, sleeping on the road is impossible. First of all, you're in a bus with not only the band, but the crew, it smells like a locker room. And when you check into a hotel, it's not the Four Seasons, but the Comfort Inn, it's barely habitable and the food makes you yearn for home cooking.\n\nYou've got an audience that will support you, but you've got to satiate it to stay alive.\n\nAlthough they're tattooed and pierced, they're just like you. Maybe worse off. These tend to be blue collar gentlemen. If they're not playing music, they're\u2026working in a print shop, as one ex-member of Black Flag is doing.\n\nSomehow, as a result of the burgeoning classic rock scene and then the MTV explosion there's a conception that playing music means you're rich, that it's a 24\/7 party, that the highest and best occupation is playing music.\n\nThat's wrong. That's all it is, playing music. You've got to love it, otherwise it's tedious. Not only do you miss out on normal life, taking your kids to school, being there for their birthdays and Halloween, you've got to endure the endless road, arguing with your bandmates and wasting the 23 hours a day you're not on stage. It's some weird bizarro world, where not only do you not get to do what you want, but most of what you do do is positively awful.\n\nNow if you're in your twenties, if you're just out of the house, the road is an adventure. But it gets old real quick.\n\nEveryone in music complains that they just can't make money like they used to, that the Internet and the public have screwed them. But no matter how much money they pay you, going on the road becomes an endless repetitious tunnel. The only saving grace is the music. And if you're lucky, the money.\n\nIt's like God hit a giant reset button. It's like someone flipped the Monopoly board. We're starting all over, building up from the ground. And if you don't need it, it doesn't pay to do it."}
{"text":"Parents need to know Parents need to know that War Game is not a typical holiday story and those looking for a feel-good tale will be disappointed. The beautifully told short animated film is set during World War I and serves as a comment on war and humanity. While there is no graphic violence, much of the action is set in the trenches; there is gunfire, rats, bombs, and casualties. The subject matter could be too intense for younger viewers, but for those mature enough to comprehend the deeper meanings of Christmas and peace, War Game should provoke discussion about history, warfare, Christmas, and how the three are often conveyed in popular culture.\n\nFamilies can talk about how warfare is represented in this film. How accurate do you believe this film depicts the realities of war, and how does it compare to other films about war?\n\nWhat are some of the ways the film presents its underlying themes? How does the animation affect the story?\n\nWhat's the story? It is the beginning of World War I. Will and Freddie live in the English Countryside, two teenagers happy to live on a farm with their parents and play soccer with their friends. But when their country declares war against Germany, they feel the call to duty just like the rest of their friends. Despite the protestations of their mother (Kate Winslet), Will and Freddie enlist and end up in the trenches of France. They learn the harsh realities of war, but when a German soldier on Christmas day leaves his trench to start a soccer game between the two rival armies, Will and Freddie jump at the chance to forget about war and fighting, no matter how bleak each army's future seems.\n\nIs it any good? WAR GAME stands apart from other stories set at Christmas in that it conveys a profound message about the true meaning of Christmas without sentimentality. In less than half an hour, this animated film presents deep lessons on the realites of war, what Christmas represents, and a historical snapshot of trench warfare in World War I. That being said, War Game is excellent, but is not typical holiday fare.Based on a book, the animation is quite distinct, and goes far to contrast the innocent pleasures of youth with the horrors of war creating a deeply moving experience.\n\nThe Good Stuff\n\nMessages:\nBeyond the divisions of war and battles between countries and their armies, there is a shared humanity that unites us all.\n\nRole Models: Will learns to see the humanity in the enemy he has been sent to fight.\n\nWhat to watch out for\n\nViolence\nWhile not graphic, the violence and horror of war is strongly implied. There are sounds and images of machine gun fire, bombs, and injured soldiers.\n\nSex:\nNot an issue\n\nLanguage: Not an issue\n\nConsumerism: Not an issue\n\nDrinking, drugs & smoking: Characters are shown smoking cigarettes and pipes in a historically accurate setting.

{"text":"This review is incredible (duh). My favorite part, however, was that while I was reading it there was a massive advertising banner for the movie across the top of the page. Way to go, Stranger-ad-placement team :)\n\n@everyone: teachers are definitely mandated reporters, as are administrators, emts, paramedics, camp counselors (at city run camps anyway in don't know about private), soccer coaches, and many other employees who come in contact with children. As a summer camp employee and an EMT, every time i get a new job I have to go through what's called a \"livescan--\" it's a thorough government background check with fingerprinting and the works. And yes, if I fail to report anything that even possibly smells like child abuse I get in big trouble. And @38, we don't hear about it because it's not news. People do their jobs, report when they have to, occasionally CPS has to get called to determine whether abuse is taking place (sometimes it is, sometimes its not), it's really sad and difficult, it really sucks for everyone involved, and life goes on. That's how it works in a system where moral superiority is not a defining part of your advertising rhetoric.\n\nI just realized my favorite part of this movie is how the onlookers don't all start whipping out iphones and cameras left and right. They gawk (or don't), and then go back to their business. In the states there would be so many goddamn photo flashes and pointing that the video wouldn't even work.\n\nJudah-- I really appreciate your commentary here. I've spent a few years living in a decently meth-riddled small town and sometimes doing medical work... I've seen far worst health, crime, dishonesty from tweakers than from potheads or even alcoholics so I generally think of it as pretty much the Worst Drug Ever. Generally I've thought of as just having to do with poor, desperate addictive lifestyles (meth is cheap, etc) but I've never really had the gaps filled in so easily or articulately as you just did. Thanks for educating this EMT-- I'll be a better caregiver because of it. Good luck on your boring\/time consuming work; that blows I've totally been there.\n\nMatisse, surely you know that the pacifier has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with the teeth-gnashing jaw pain in the 7th hour of an ecstacy high, right?

{"text":"Movie Review: The Rum Diary\n\nGrade: B -- 120 minutes\n\nThe Rum Diary\" is a big pipe dream of a film \u2014 fun to watch, but a bit disconnected, strung together by the endless promise of booze, sex and drugs.\n\nDirected by Bruce Robinson (his first film since 1992's \"Jennifer Eight\"), \"The Rum Diary\" is based on the novel of the same name by late gonzo journalist and famed drug-addled writer, Hunter S. Thompson.\n\nThe film stars Johnny Depp as Paul Kemp, a rambling journalist leaving New York to write for a flailing newspaper in Puerto Rico in the early 1960s. Once there, he realizes that the country is full of protests, poverty and pain, not to mention copious amounts of rum.\n\nHe meets Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart, \"The Dark Knight\"), a suave, rich man about town who also happens to be quite corrupt. Kemp goes along with Sanderson's smooth-talking ways in order to get close to his fianc\u00e9e, Chenault (Amber Heard, \"Zombieland\").\n\nAll the while, he gets close to Sala (Michael Rispoli, \"Kick-Ass\"), a journalist more interested in having fun, getting drunk, doing drugs and throwing down bets in cock fights, rather than writing stories.\n\nThe acting and cinematography were fantastic, but it was a shame that the movie felt so disparate and poorly put together. There's a rambling aspect to it, as though the entire film was propelling itself to some sort of grandiose, dramatic ending that never really happened.\n\nThough it might be cruel to say the movie had no point, it truly managed to develop a random plotline that viewers couldn't have gotten invested in, even if they tried.\n\nHowever, Depp does a fantastic job playing Kemp, never taking himself too seriously. He elicits laughs from the audience with mere facial ticks and cleverly muttered one-liners.\n\nYet, the best acting in the film was from Giovanni Ribisi (\"Avatar\"), who played Moburg, a hopelessly decrepit drug addict who walked with a hunched over shuffle and spoke in a grating, slurred voice.\n\nMoburg was one of the most interesting characters in the film, albeit the most useless. He moped around town, sniffing out grain alcohol and insanely illegal drugs (like one liquid that caused horrific hallucinations and could only be ingested by squeezing little drops into the user's eyeball).\n\nHeard is super seductive as Chenault, slithering around the film in tiny dresses, with overly tan skin, berry red lips and ice blonde locks. Her character was almost a modern Marilyn Monroe: doe-eyed and delicate with a slight wild streak, but hanging on foolishly to the arms of powerful men in order to sustain her lifestyle.\n\n\"The Rum Diary\" ended up feeling like more of a trippy dark comedy, though it never really delved deeply into the darkness that hovered in the shadows of the film.\n\nThere were plenty of nonsensical scenes that offered comedic relief, like the one where Sala and Kemp were forced to ride on each other's laps when their car got completely ruined by thieving locals.\n\nIn addition, the cinematography is breathtaking, taking every advantage of the beautiful beaches and buildings that Puerto Rico had to offer.\n\nWhile the film didn't end up delivering any sort of point or plotline that the audience could grasp, the script was full of Thompson-penned jewels. In one scene where Kemp thinks about the debauchery he's gotten himself into (including a fire fight and getting arrested) he wonders to himself, \"How the hell did I get here? I could blame the job, the booze \u2014 but the truth is even more outrageous.\"\n\nIf only the film could have managed to deliver some of that outrageousness.\n\nThough \"The Rum Diary\" tries to shock, excite and tantalize the audience, it just ends up fizzling out thanks to promising a thousand different things and delivering on almost none."}

{"text":"Titanic\n\nAction director James Cameron mixes action and sentimentality in this oceangoing adventure.\n\nIt''s Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic, if you haven''t heard yet. The costliest film ever made is also one of the best, unlike the second costliest, Kevin Costner''s ill-fated Waterworld (and just what is it with aquatic overexpenditures these days, anyway?).\n\nReams have already been written on James Cameron''s wild cost overruns, so I''ll spare you that and say right off that every penny spent is up there on the screen. Like the doomed vessel from which it takes its tale, Cameron''s film is a behemoth, svelte, streamlined, and not the least bit ponderous, even with its lengthy three-hour-and-fifteen-minute running time (the film is practically as long as the sinking of the Titanic itself).\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is charmingly rakish in the role of lower-class scoundrel-cum-artist Jack Dawson, who wins his way onboard the HMS Titanic during a card game moments before the ship sets sail on its maiden and funeral voyage from England to New York City. Once onboard, he meets Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), a 17-year-old first-class passenger, who is engaged to the wealthy, utterly pompous Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). In short order, Rose and Jack fall in love, he sketches her in the altogether, and Cal, predictably, grits his teeth and scowls meaningfully.\n\nJust over halfway into the film, the oceanliner grazes the fatal iceberg that will, 80 minutes later, send it plunging into the icy depths. It''s a matter of historical record that 1,500 passengers perished that night due, in no small part, to the fact that there were less than half the necessary lifeboats on board. Cameron, who is inarguably the greatest living action director working today, milks this for all it''s worth and does a splendid job, cutting between Rose and Jack''s ill-timed romance and the fate of the ship in general. His crosscutting between those two stories and several other, minor subplots is the stuff film courses are made of. At his core though, Cameron, for all his Terminators andTrue Lies, is a savagely sentimental romantic, and it''s this interplay between the lovestruck steerage lad and the first-class dream girl that fires everything else about the film, including the modern-day wraparound that features Cameron favorite Bill Paxton as a salvage engineer intent on plundering the Titanic''s silted corpse.\n\nI''ve always had trouble getting past DiCaprio''s spirited self-he seems unable to fully vanish into any role other than that of himself, though he comes very, very close under Cameron''s iron thumb. Winslet, on the other hand, is so perfectly cast that it''s as though she''s a brand new face, and not the Hollywood superstar she''s currently becoming. The two of them play wonderfully off of each other, as do the host of lesser players (notably David Warner as Cal''s conniving valet and Bernard Hill as the ship''s captain), resulting in a monster of a film in which, for once, the astonishing special effects are overshadowed by the characters onscreen. Just barely, though.\n\nCameron''s dialogue has never been as good as his direction, which makes for a few stilted clunkers along the way, but the unstoppable flurry of Action! Romance! Etcetera! sweeps them away like so much driftwood. It''s obvious this is Cameron''s bid for historical relevance, and though it may fall short of the Lawrence of Arabia mark he was aiming for, it''s still by far and away a grand, gorgeous, breathtaking spectacle"}
{"text":"Movie Review: Synecdoche, New York\n\nThe word \"synecdoche\" is defined as a figure of speech in which a part of a word is use for the whole of it. Yeah... that pretty much sums up the lack of sense of Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut Synecdoche, New York. Even trying to pronounce half of the title is a task in and of itself, never mind trying to grasp what the movie could all be about. But strangely it's a compelling and satisfyingly ambiguous piece of work that features superb performances and poses so any questions that multiple viewings is absolutely essential.\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman plays Caden Cotard, a troubled theatre director who, after being awarded a MacArthur genius grant, attempts to create an ambitious, gigantic play in a gargantuan-sized set of New York inside a warehouse. He has health troubles, women troubles, family troubles, and all the while is trying to figure what his play actually is about and how he's going to finish. To explain the plot any further would be an act in futility on my part.\n\nThe majority of Synecdoche, New York makes little to no sense, even upon further inspection during a second viewing. It starts off like a normal story about a troubled theatre director and his ambitious new project, but we learn quickly that this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill movie. It takes us down the rabbit hole that's inside the world within the rabbit hole... and then takes down another one after that. But much like David Lynch's masterpiece Inland Empire, I imagine Kaufman didn't intend for the movie to make sense... or at least I think he didn't.\n\nHoffman is perfect for the role of Caden; he gets to play that awkward, likable despite his flaws, shlubby character that we all know he can play in his sleep. Surrounded by amazing supporting performances from the likes of Samantha Morton, Catherine Keener, Tom Noonan, Michelle Williams, Hope Davis, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, Hoffman goes through the fractured, layered narrative talking about the philosophical intentions of his play... and yet he seems to know nothing. Caden seems very much intent on keeping the characters as much in the dark as we are, with things happening out of blue that sometimes bother the characters and sometimes not. It's all a bit of a head trip.\n\nWhat shines through clearly here is Kaufman's inexperience as a director. Three of his previous screenplays, the brilliant Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, had Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry, respectively, behind the camera to guide them and keep them semi-comprehensible so they could thus be enjoyed by a pretty wide audience, despite the weirdness inherent within them. However, with Synecdoche, the shackles are off and it doesn't have as good an effect. It's about the only thing that holds the movie back, the thing that ultimately stops it from being accurately labeled a masterpiece. Kaufman is a much better writer than he is a director, and one only wonders just how phenomenal this thing could have been had someone like Jonze or Gondry directed it instead.\n\nI am a film critic and blogger, and have been so since late 2007, going from starting my own movie review website, Movie World (which is still running), and then moving on to writing for various movie blogs."}
{"text":"Michael Winterbottom's A Mighty Heart is in the inauspicious position of having the decked stacked against it. Since the film is based on the events surrounding the kidnapping of American journalist Daniel Pearl (Dan Futterman, Enough) in Pakistan in 2002, the widespread media coverage of the event means that most viewers will already know the film's outcome.\n\nThis isn't necessarily the death knell for a film that fancies itself as a political thriller, as long as the director is able to keep the tension up. Winterbottom is able to accomplish this for a bit, using every trick he knows to keep the film's pace quick and frantic as we come to Daniel's kidnapping. The problem, however, is that we are never given a chance to really get to know or care about any of the film's characters. Sure, there are a few flashbacks to times shared by Daniel and his wife, Mariane (Angelina Jolie), but establishing the love between them is handled more as an afterthought. The audience is just supposed to know and accept that the couple loves one another, as opposed to this actually being shown on-screen. Given no reason to possess genuine interest in these characters, we're instead left slogging through a lot of complicated, convoluted Mideast politics towards an ending that everyone knows is coming.\n\nThe events of the film are seen through Mariane's eyes, who in real life wrote the book on which the movie is based. Jolie, who has been able to make a career off of reputation, persona and publicity more so than from having an actual track record as an actress, is solid throughout, though her supposedly French accent sounds more like the pseudo-Transylvanian brogue she adopted in Alexander (2004). She's also not helped by one of the most purely obnoxious Oscar moments in film, a scene that was obviously meant to be cathartic and unsettling, but ends up feeling overwrought and distracting.\n\nThere are numerous opportunities to take advantage of the film's subject matter and address some of the issues inherent in it, but many of the questions which could have been raised are instead ignored. For instance, despite the film's own admission that 10 Pakistanis were killed due to terrorism in the time that Daniel was being held captive, no one in the film ever questions why so much time, money and resources are used in order to find one American. Not to say that those resources should've been rejected, but rather the film, through its own footage of Karachi, often inadvertently paints a portrait of wealthy, affluent Americans in a country of impoverished Pakistanis, something I am sure was not intended. The film also touches on the treatment of the detainees at Guant\u00e1namo, but then there is never an objection raised, let alone the morality questioned of Pakistani officials torturing prisoners in order to find out Daniel's whereabouts.\n\nThere are a couple of instances when the film shows glimpses of what it could have been, such as the borderline unsettling interrogation of Omar (Aly Khan, Nazar) or the film's climax, which nearly makes up for the lack of emotional resonance through much of the rest of the movie. However, these scenes never quite materialize, and remain near misses.\n\nA Mighty Heart will rank much higher with people who followed or are still interested in the story of Daniel and Mariane Pearl, or for anyone with a curiosity towards Mideast politics. However, as filmmaking, it remains well-intentioned, but ultimately lacking"}

{"text":"absorbing, gritty naturalism that draws the viewer into the intimacy of the moment. Unfortunately, her screenplay presents the viewer with a host of unattractive characters who never manage to transcend their clich\u00e9 heroin-chic grunginess, and hence are never of much interest.\n\nAustralian actress Radha Mitchell plays Syd, a 24-year-old assistant magazine editor at a high-profile photography magazine called \"Frame.\" On the surface, she appears to have a good job and a promising career, although her superior editors, Harry (David Thornton) and Dominique (Ahn Duong) often treat her like a secretary. But worse than that, she is living with her utterly humdrum boyfriend, James, who is played by Gabriel Mann as a character just slightly more fascinating than dirt. The point is to show that Syd is caught in a life that is pleasing on the exterior and dull at its heart, but Cholodenko overplays the hand with face-slapping obviousness.\n\nSyd finds the spark of life in the form of Lucy Berliner (Ally Sheedy), a once-great photographer who literally disappeared 10 years earlier to spare herself the soul-deadening extremes of the high-profile art world. Lucy lives with her drug-addicted lover, Greta (Patricia Clarkson), a sleazy German actress who used to star in Rainer Fassbinder films, and an assortment of other junkies and hangers-on who seem to have no purpose other than to surround Lucy and indicate that she is someone of importance who draws others to her.\n\nLucy certainly attracts Syd, who convinces her to come out of obscurity and shoot a spread for \"Frame.\" As they begin working together, Syd becomes more and more infatuated with Lucy, and soon she is hanging out in her apartment, snorting heroin, and generally ignoring her boring-as-wallpaper boyfriend, which should be of dramatic importance, but isn't. The relationship between Syd and Lucy gradually grows into something sexual, although there is little meaningful explanation its growth and development.\n\nCholodenko does an excellent job of depicting the sexual sequences, of which the film has many. She keeps these scenes natural and unsensational, so they maintain their integrity as scenes of two people trying to connect on some level. The only time there ever is a sexual connection is between Lucy and Syd, but Cholodenko leaves the motives and reasoning in their relationship ambiguous, thus allowing the audience to interpret Syd's intimacies with Lucy as her having found either her inner lesbian or something purer that is so unique it transcends sexuality.\n\nIt is precisely at this point that \"High Art\" is at its most perplexing. It is, by all accounts, a character study, but we have little to explain these peculiar people. Cholodenko gives us surface realities, such as introducing Lucy's mother (Tammy Grimes) to show she is rich and thus explain how Lucy has survived for the last 10 years without working. We know little or nothing about Syd, except that she is alternately naive, ambitious, and shy. Radha Mitchell gives a good performance, but she never manages to make us truly care about Syd because she remains so distant and contradictory.\n\nAs Lucy, Ally Sheedy gives a breakthrough performance that is often shocking in its frankness. For those who remembers Sheedy in '80s-era Brat Pack movies like \"Oxford Blues\" (1985) and \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (1985), it is quite surprising to see her tense, saddened face and slumping, gaunt body. Like Syd, Lucy is also a contradictory character, someone who doesn't want to \"sell out\" her art, yet wastes her talents living with degenerates. Just as there is no explaining why Syd would be with someone as dull as James, there is no reason why Lucy would be with someone as self-absorbed and self-destructive as Greta, unless you consider that it's easier to justify Syd and Lucy leaving their respective lovers for each other if those lovers are not worth staying with.\n\n\"High Art\" is the kind of the film that leaves you wishing for more. You want more information about the characters. You want to see them in different situations and surroundings. And you certainly want something more from the ending than the cynical, downbeat, inexplicable one Cholodenko leaves us with. You can feel \"High Art\" trying to make some kind of grand statement about life, art, and relationships, but the separate pieces never come together into the absorbing whole it's meant to be."}

The story is about Harlan Williams (Keith Szarabajka), an old janitor who works in a military installation.\n\nHe stumbles upon a top secret experiment by a mad scientist (Bill Raymond) working on regeneration (you can see why the military would be interested in this) and begins growing younger. The government is interested in turning him into a guinea pig so they can learn the process by which the reversal of aging occurs. The movie is essentially about his run from the government while being pursued by vicious killers from various federal agencies. The plot I thought was pretty well executed (except for the ending) and the effects are decent. I found Williams' wife (played by Frances Sternhagen) rather annoying, both in terms of character and her portrayal by Sternhagen. The side effects of messing around with regeneration is not addressed properly. There is some decent acting by Ed Lauter and Felicity Huffman who play government agents who turn against their government to save Williams life.

Throughout the movie, I was surprised to see the different races portrayed in the movie itself. I was able to see the Asians (the Japanese), the Whites, and the Aborigines. This movie truly shows that Australia was a multi-cultural territory in the early 1930's at the time of World War II.\nThe movie, which takes place in Australia during World War II centers on a story about a high-class English aristocrat who travels from England to Australia to meet her husband. However, instead of reuniting with her husband, she arrives to hear the shocking news that her husband, Maitland was killed shortly before her arrival. While trying to find out the truth behind her husband's death, she befriends a young boy named Nullah. The relationship between Nullah, who is half white and half Aboriginal, and Lady Sarah, portrays one that is unique, yet special considering the fact that Nullah was what the Whites called \"Creamy\" (because of his mixture in race) and Lady Ashley was a high class English woman.\nFrom the start of the movie, the racial relation between England and Australia is shown. The drover gets into a fight at the local pub and Sarah Ashley, who is dressed in formal clothing, enters the local pub and doesn't seem to care that the Australian men are yelling and fighting until her bags are opened and revealed while the men are attacking each other. All her lingerie and expensive clothing are thrown into the air and she is automatically frozen. These men don't seem to care that these because they probably have no idea what is worth. However, Lady Ashley who probably takes care of all her belongings like they are treasures is horrified that this can actually happen.

Instead, our man wakes up from the\nassassination attempt, unharmed, and for reasons\nunknown, finds himself stuck in a seemingly\nendless loop that repeats itself every hour,\nleaving only Adam to remember the hour previous.\n\nAlthough the world continues\non, resetting every hour, Adam remembers\neverything that has transpired. His only clue is\nthe attempt on his life, which sends him in search\nof answers. Adam believes that the answers lie in\nhis capturing of the elusive assassin. Or does it?\nIs Adam dead, and somehow existing only in limbo,\ntrapped between Heaven and Hell? If that's the\ncase, why does a woman named Rebecca (Etya Dudko),\nwho Adam first meets in a bar, also seems to be\nstuck in limbo as he?\n\nFor much of its first hour,\nand despite occurrences of a fantastical element\nlike a time loop, \"Limbo\" is fashioned\nvery much like an old fashion detective story, the\nnoir qualities of those old stories made even more\nobvious by the black and white. It's only later on\nwhen, in a spurt of manic anger, Adam kills a\nhomeless man, that the film takes on more overt\nphilosophical intentions. And because\n\"Limbo\" (purposely) has none of the\nwhimsical of the similarly themed \"Groundhog\nDay\", Adam's actions do not involve hitting\non the pretty girl in hopes of getting laid, but\nrather trying to keep himself from continually\nkilling that mugger who keeps trying to mug him,\nor harming that prostitute who refuses to\n\"just talk\".\n\nGod, religion, the nature of\nman's free will, and what one should or should not\ndo if there were no consequence to his actions,\nall come to the fore before all is said and done.\nThese are, without a doubt, pretty heady topics,\nand Ikimi certainly knows more than his share of\nPhilosophy 101. \"Limbo\" is indeed a very\nintellectual film, and if one were uninterested in\nthe subject, one might be inclined to calling\nIkimi and his movie overly pretentious. Then\nagain, the fact that the film knows its subject\nvery well would seem to indicate that\n\"Limbo\" is very much a heartfelt\napproach to, as well as a genuine attempt to\nexplore, the subject matter at hand.\n\nA major plus for\n\"Limbo\" is leading man Christopher\nRusso, who carries the entire film from beginning\nto end like a champ. Russo is a fine actor, and to\nwatch the character slowly unravel from a man who\nthought he had left his checkered past behind to a\nman who slowly comes to embrace what he once was,\nyou can't help but wonder why this guy hasn't done\nanything major yet. Less successful are the rest\nof the cast, but because Ikimi's script is so\nAdam-centric, this isn't an insult. Etya Dudko has\nlittle to do as Rebecca. Likewise with John Holt,\nas a stranger who seems to know what's going on,\nor perhaps he's just crazy.\n\nAnother sign of\n\"Limbo's\" success is that you wouldn't\nknow the film was low-budget if nobody told you.\nIt is that visually impressive, not an easy feat\nconsidering the digital video format, which has\nnever been all that kind to visually-inclined\nfilmmaking. Ikimi and company have a fantastic\nunderstanding of cinematic aesthetics, and take\nevery natural advantage supplied by the choice to\nuse black and white. Despite some slow spots in\nthe middle, it's startling how good\n\"Limbo\" is, especially for a first\nfeature shot on a meager budget. Mark Thomas Ikimi\nas a filmmaker to watch."}
{"text":"Nichols leaves the details up to the viewer's imagination as he limns an often striking, at times agonizing portrait of the effects of rampaging fear on one man, and the ripple effect it has on his family, loved ones, and community. Unfortunately, Nichols' ideas start to run out of steam before the film reaches its conclusion, while, ironically, the finale itself might leave viewers craving something a little more substantial.\n\nMichael Shannon (Revolutionary Road) delivers another impressive performance at the center of Nichols' carefully constructed maelstrom of foreboding. Shannon plays Curtis, a foreman with a small-town Ohio construction company. He shares a comfy suburban home with his pretty and loving wife, Sam (Jessica Chastain), their spunky little deaf daughter, Hannah (Tova Stewart), with whom they communicate via ASL, and the family dog. Curtis' good life is the envy of his friends and co-workers.\n\nBut the nightly news is full of paranoia-inducing horror stories of mining disasters and chlorine spills. Soon, Curtis is hearing ferocious thunder cracks when the sky is perfectly clear. He starts having apocalyptic visions of oily brown rain, lightning bolts exploding across the sky like fireworks, ominous swarms of birds creating gigantic, swirling Rorschach patterns in the sky, or dead crows raining down from above. Even worse are nightmares that hit Curtis (and the viewer) on a terrifyingly visceral level because they start out so real.\n\nNichols is very effective in seeding these dream sequences seamlessly into the texture of the narrative, so the audience, like Curtis, is always a little off-kilter about what may or may not really be happening. Curtis tries to cope by reading up on mental illness. (We see why when he goes to visit his mom\u2014an understated Kathy Baker\u2014in assisted living.) But he can't shake the irrational panic that grips him day and night, affecting his job and his marriage. Falling behind in his other obligations, he fences in the dog, buys gas masks, and takes out a risky loan against his mortgage to renovate and provision the old underground storm shelter in his back yard.\n\nThere are two ways one might interpret Nichols' unfolding story. Either the pervasive culture of fear in this country is all in our heads (and we need to get a grip), or it's a mass premonition of something truly dire to come. (\"I'm afraid something might be coming. Something that's not right,\" is the closest Curtis can come to articulating his feelings to his wife.) The film seems willing to support either thesis (or both) depending on how one reads it.\n\nBut the trouble is, beyond the impending sense of all-purpose dread ratcheted up to fever pitch a half-hour into the movie, or so (Don't go to sleep! Don't get in the car! Don't get too close to that equipment!), the viewer doesn't really experience whatever the movie is saying on any profound level. Nichols generates plenty of tension and anxiety for its own sake, but that's not the same thing as telling a coherent, affecting story. He does succeed in replicating the suffocating panic of non-stop fear, but the film as a whole amounts to little more than an exercise in metaphor, told with the eerie sensibilities of a horror movie, a premise in search of a story at"}
{"text":"As of the week of Memorial Day 2008, there have been 4,083 confirmed United States military deaths due to the war in Iraq. For most Americans, the continually mounting death toll amounts to nothing more than a detached, gruesome body bag scoreboard for a \"conflict\" more than half a world away.\n\nEach day in the local paper and on television, the number of casualties grows followed by the prerequisite picture of closed caskets and draped American flags shadowed by the images of tear streaked faces of relatives of the fallen. For most of us, those numbers are an impersonal reminder to the harsh world that surrounds us yet is buffered in our own sheltered existence.\n\nFor the families of the deceased, there is no harsher reality. To them, these \"numbers\" and totals represent real people. Not just numerals representing the lowest common denominator of American policy, these soldiers are and were fathers, mothers, sons and daughters whose deaths are devastating to all involved.\n\nSo is the story of \"Grace is Gone\" starring the heart wrenchingly un-John Cusack, John Cusack. Cusack plays Stanley Phillips a Para militaristic store manager who wears his patriotism on his sleeve. Without fail, he explains, and believingly so to his two daughters that their mom is not with them at the moment because she is fighting for \"everyone's freedom.\"\n\nStanley's world and entire belief system is shaken to its core upon the revelation that his wife, Grace, has been killed in service of her country in the Middle East.\n\nIn perfect cinematic dichotomy, Cusack's Phillips world of reality and denial is ripped to the forefront as he answers the door to two uniformed military personnel. There can only be one reason for their presence and every emotion is purely portrayed by Cusack's deadpan poignancy.\n\nWhat ensues is Stanley's literal and figurative \"fall from Grace.\" He must deal with just how he must break the news to his daughters about the loss of the family matriarch. In truly American cinematic fare, he embarks on a potentially soul cleansing cross country \"road trip\" looking for answers."}
{"text":"It's anything but obvious. A sweetly surprising treatise on friendship, it'll make you create your own list of friends, using its engagingly vague criteria.\n\nA self-absorbed antiques dealer (Daniel Auteuil) goes to a funeral, to rustle up a little business, you understand. He notices how few mourners turn up. He notices, too, how the priest keeps using the word \"friends\" in his eulogy. And he notices how no one, not even the dead man's family, minds when he tactlessly brings up a business proposition in the receiving line.\n\nHe wonders who his friends are. At every corner, he sees them, folks amiably chatting, bonding, sharing. Too many signs read \"Amis\" (\"friends\").\n\nHe attends a dinner with colleagues and associates where he mentions the small turnout. \"There'll be fewer at yours,\" his equally tactless business partner blurts out.\n\nNot so, not so, the dealer insists. But when a bet is made and he is forced to rustle up one good friend, he can't. Perhaps he can hire one, or make a new friend, with the help of a self-help book, a lecturer on friendship or some such.\n\nBut this isn't The Valet or Green Card, a movie about a comical impostor. It's by Patrice Leconte, a thoughtful filmmaker whose Intimate Strangers (about a woman who mistakes an accountant for her new shrink) and The Girl on the Bridge (about a suicide interrupted by a circus knife-thrower) haunt you and make you think.\n\nAnd My Best Friend proceeds to do just that.\n\nWhat constitutes a friend, what criteria? How does one measure up as a friend? Aside from ensuring a full funeral, is it ever worth the investment?\n\nWell-cast, amusing without ever quite achieving \"daffy,\" the perpetually downcast Auteuil is dismayingly perfect as Francois, the man without a friend to call his own. Distracted even when he's talking to his lover or his asthmatic daughter (Julie Durand), he is not somebody who cares much for other people. He calls it \"respecting\" their privacy. They call it cold.\n\nBut this cabby he runs into, a sad sack of a trivia bore named Bruno (Dany Boon of Joyeaux Noel) doesn't seem to suffer from a lack of friends.\n\nBruno is outgoing, chatty to a fault, a man who takes an interest in other people. He is effortlessly charming, in his own awkward way. Francois is just awkward.\n\n\"You have to be sociable.\"\n\n\"Teach me to be sociable.\"\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\n\"I never joke.\"\n\n\"That's your first mistake.\"\n\nFrancois tries to become more outgoing, more polite. But he's a slow-learner. He hits a bar and he clears the room in an instant. He scares off mothers pushing strollers, diners in a cafe, old men playing bocce.\n\nGradually, by small degrees, Leconte lets us see the desperation in Francois, the changes he needs to make and can't see. But he also lets us into Bruno's lonely world.\n\nOne thing that doesn't work here is the person who throws down the bet. The stunning lesbian gallery partner Catherine (Julie Gayet) is so frosty and rude as to not be worth the trouble Francois goes to in order to impress.\n\nBut so much else does. The odd painful moment is followed by a comically clueless one as both men have a lot to learn in what it truly takes to be a friend. Dear Abby said it best.\n\n\"A friend is somebody who sees through you, and enjoys the show.\"\n\nHowever obvious its set-up, My Best Friend pays dividends in its execution.\n\nEven the plot twists that we anticipate manage some bit of surprise.\n\nThis adorable film, in French with English subtitles, opens today at the Enzian.

{"text":"Parents say\n\nKids say\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nParents need to know that this is a unique comedy charting an affair between a young man and a married friend of his parents. Much time is spent on the initial seduction and subsequent clandestine meetings in hotel rooms. Though no graphic depictions of intercourse are shown, there are brief shots of female nudity during the seduction and later in a nightclub scene, where a woman strips down to underwear and pasties. Language is fairly restrained, with a few minor curse words, like \"ass\" or \"damn\" used sparingly. Many of the adults are shown drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes very casually and with an air of acceptance.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nAfter Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) graduates from college, he's disinterested in everything, career related or not. A family friend, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), propositions him with an offer of casual sex. The affair seems to bring Benjamin a certain level of contentment. Soon Ben finds problems with their relationship and develops an interest in the Robinsons' daughter Elaine (Katherine Ross), much to Mrs. Robinsons' disapproval.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nMuch has been said about the success and aftershocks of the release of THE GRADUATE in 1967. Certainly its deadpan humor and the main character's palpable sense of unease resonated with audience members steeped in the rising counterculture movement. It stands as a document of an era. The lush soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel underscores a pervasive melancholy throughout the film, while also giving certain quiet moments an astounding serenity \u2013- a marriage of pop music and film that influenced many later films.\n\nAnother way this movie is influential: The plot seems to build towards an energetic climax, but the actual closing moments are listless, providing little closure. This way of leaving a film open-ended and unsettled, above all else, influenced many of the cinematic treasures of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a period that most look back on as golden days of motion picture history this movie has aged. Does Benjamin's lack of direction upon graduating seem applicable today, or is it more reflective of the state of youth in the 60s? Parents will definitely want to address his complicated relationship with Mrs. Robinson. Does Mrs. Robinson seem genuinely interested in Benjamin? If not, what might her motives be in seducing him? Why does Elaine seem to gain appeal for Benjamin when Mrs. Robinson forbids him to see her? Why is the movie called The Graduate?\n\nenjoyable\n\nDustin Hoffman is amazing as usual and I really loved the music and the cinematography. It should probably have a PG-13 rating by today's rating, but I think it's pretty normal for older movies that today be rated PG-13 rated PG"}
{"text":"Stanley Kramer's 1959 antiwar movie looks like everything Kramer did: subtle as a car wreck but undeniably affecting. Gregory Peck plays a submarine commander looking for survivors in Australia after a nuclear holocaust. Ava Gardner is among them and, somewhat improbably under the circumstances, becomes his love interest. Fred Astaire and Anthony Perkins are among the characters awaiting death from the gradual spread of radiation from the north. One might scoff at Kramer's implicit finger-wagging about nuclear politics in this mad, mad, mad, mad world, but it is hard to stop watching this compelling drama all the same. --Tom Keogh\n\nIn the days of the Cold War; in the days when there were two super powers in the world; and, in the days when the atomic bomb hung over the heads of the western world we all waited for the day the world would end with radio-activity spreading around the globe. This movie is the story of what that might look like. It is a clasic. It is particularly well done.\n\nI know there are some scientific discrepancies and that the sub is actually diesel and not nuclear, but I don't care. I'm not anal enough to have those details detract from a first-rate movie. And this is a first-rate movie! It kept me on the edge of my seat again - and I remember those days in which this film was made. Air raid drills and 'what to do in a nuclear explosion' drills. It WAS scary. This film captures that time, and that fear exactly as I recall it! The cast was super - Peck, Gardner, Astair and Perkins very solid in their role, along with the supporting cast as well. This film takes me back to those days - and reminds me how lucky we were that the film didn't become true. It still could. The musical score is a wonderfully haunting score that takes you right in. Altogether, this film is a triumph of film making and a treasure, then, and now.\n\nOn the Beach fails the realism test in two ways: scientifically and behaviorally. The first is forgivable; 40+ years ago, there was less understanding of what nuclear war would do the planet. But the second aspect -- human behavior -- is where the story fails. The idea that people would get up, wash and shave and dress, go to their jobs, peacefully obtain their rations of food and so on, with a cloud of certain death getting closer every day... it just doesn't ring true. Looting, pillaging, murder, and general anarchy seem much more likely. Nevertheless, the movie -- while very melancholy (or depressing, as many reviewers have said), is worth watching. (Especially, as some have noted, for Astaire's performance)."}

The only problem is that Louis lives a rather dull life, and so the TV execs decide to inject some much needed excitement to boost their ratings. If the plot sounds all too familiar, it is because the film was later remade in America as EdTV.\n\nThe film isn't anywhere near as brilliant as The Truman Show, but nowhere near as generic as EdTV either. Being a native of Montreal, though, I couldn't go without mentioning it. Quebecers may take pleasure in the various cultural references and countless cameos, but the rest of the world may find themselves lost or even somewhat bored.

It was also a nominee for Best Motion Picture, ultimately losing to Exotica."}
{"text":"A Darker, More Violent, Comic Book Film\n\nI find it really strange anyone would watch \"The Punisher\" and come out upset about the film's violence. Come on. Did anyone seriously believe a movie called \"The Punisher\" would be about kitty cats and dandelions? Watch the trailer or pick up the comic book the movie's based on and it's readily apparent this isn't your average 'fun' comic book subject. Speaking of comic books, it's time to issue my disclaimer: Yada, yada, yada, I don't know anything about comic books, yada, yada, yada, don't expect this review to compare and contrast the source material to the movie, and so on. From what I gather from my limited research into the realm of comics, \"The Punisher\" in comic book form is a dark tale, as is the movie.\n\nThe film opens with FBI Special Agent Frank Castle (Tom Jane) undercover working the last drug bust of his career. The bust goes bad when one of millionaire businessman\/bad guy Howard Saint's (John Travolta) sons winds up dead. That wasn't supposed to happen but there's no way to take it back, so Castle goes on with his retirement from service as planned. A family man through and through, Castle celebrates his new life of leisure with a family reunion in Puerto Rico. Why Puerto Rico? Heaven only knows, but that's where the happy gathering takes place, setting up a picturesque backdrop for the total annihilation of Castle's family. Seems Howard Saint isn't one to forgive and forget. Egged on by his sultry - and vicious - wife, Livia (Laura Harring), Saint ordered the massacre of everyone dear to Castle. But there's one slight hitch Saint didn't anticipate, Castle survives a vicious beating, being shot in the chest at point blank range, and getting blown up in a fiery explosion. How does he survive? Don't ask, and try to remember this is based on a comic book. Not everything has to be grounded in reality. Questioning the hows and whys will only lead to endless frustration.\n\nCastle lives on after the death of his loved ones, but other than his lust for revenge, he's pretty much dead inside. Moving into a rundown apartment, he gets back into top physical shape while plotting how he can best take down Saint. It's not just revenge Castle's after, he wants to punish Saint (hence the nickname The Punisher rather than The Revenger). Castle wants Howard to suffer emotionally and physically until he draws his last breath. How he does that is by concocting an intricate plan involving Saint's wife, Saint's lawyer, Quentin Glass (Will Patton), and by screwing with Saint's lucrative money-laundering business.\n\nFrank Castle aka The Punisher isn't a superhero. He's an American anti-hero, motivated by the need for revenge, working outside the law - a lone wolf focused on the kill. No leaping off of tall buildings or slinging webs for this comic book hero. Basically special effects-free, \"The Punisher\" portrays violence with unflinching realism. People bleed and die, the gun battles play out like, well, battles with guns - not well-choreographed ballet moves. Since Castle's an expert with guns and knives, both are used on film to dispatch the bad guys as brutally as necessary to get the job done.\n\nScreenwriter\/first-time director Jonathan Hensleigh turned back the pages to the 1970s, capturing the feel of the classic \"Dirty Harry\" and \"French Connection\" films. When Tom Jane as Castle engages in brutal hand-to-hand combat with The Russian (Kevin Nash), not once do you ever get the feeling this fight was meticulously planned out - and that's really saying something for both the actors, the stunt coordinator, and the director. So often you see onscreen fights where everything feels too precise, too mapped out, with weapons too conveniently placed. In \"The Punisher,\" Hensleigh and Jane manage to make all the fight scenes feel so organic that not once are you pulled out of the movie. After years of computer generated effects, \"The Punisher,\" with all its bloodshed and violence, is actually a refreshing change of pace.\n\nAs for the acting, Tom Jane does a commendable job of taking on a role based on a comic book character and making it feel multi-dimensional. It's not a very verbal role, but Jane has the ability to do more with a look than a lot of actors can convey with a lengthy monologue. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Ben Foster and John Pinette give the film its heart, and provide the comic relief so necessary in a film of this sort. Travolta and Patton make quite a team, with Travolta almost but not quite taking his role over the top. Overall, the acting is restrained and in keeping with the tone of the movie.\n\n\"The Punisher\" is definitely not for all audiences. It more than earns its R rating for pervasive, brutal violence and that in itself is a big turn-off to a lot of people. But if you go in with the right mindset, then \"The Punisher\" is heavy yet pretty entertaining. Lots of fighting, gunplay, explosions, and a hunk as the leading man - believe it or not, \"The Punisher\" isn't just for comic book fans."}
{"text":"The best moment in this solid documentary about the cartoonist turned fantasy oil painter comes early on when Frank Frazetta is reminiscing on the street with a few of his comics running mates (the Fleegal Gang) from 40-50 years earlier. One of them recalls that Frazetta's mom's house was a block or so away and Frazetta proclaims that she still lives there and off they go to mom's house. It's a great scene because it's so yet you learn a lot about Frazetta, both his relationship to his mom (who seems delighted to see him) and the healthy Frazetta genes.\n\nEssentially a worshipful portrait of the extremely talented Frazetta, the movie does a fine job of building a picture of the painter as a cartooning prodigy, a force in comics (and makes a straightforward case for the importance of those comics), and then as a jaw-dropping commercial painter and source of inspiration for a generation of like-minded artists. There are about a dozen artists who make up a kind of chorus; the most thoughtful is William Stout and the funniest is director Ralph Bakshi. The walk through the career is leisurely yet understandable, and scores of his sumptuous artworks are on display.\n\nIf the documentary fails Frazetta, it's in two areas. First, a case for his artistic excellence is mostly asserted, and the smarter testimony is spread out rather than concentrated in one place. The most extended talk about the value of Frazetta's work comes hidden in defensive terms -- basically \"If you don't like it when Frazetta does it, then you don't like it when famous painter X does it, either\" which really don't convince or particularly flatter. What comes across is the tone. The best talk about the work comes from collector who express preferences for certain periods of Frazetta's work over the other; the documentary could not only have used more of that but something like that all in one place.\n\nThe other area might just be a personal preference of mine, but I was struck by footage of his museum opening and the reaction that fans had to Frazetta's work to the point they were supporting it by making pilgrimages and making, I think, financial contribution. It would have been nice to contrast those experience with the way Frazetta's fellow artists looked at him. Without that context, the amount of time spent at the museum were reasonably empty celebrations of generic greatness and impact, which we don't need convnicing of at that point in the film."}
{"text":"Reviews\n\nThis Christmas\n\nIt's the holidays, thus, a cinematic rush of holiday cheer is upon us. \"This Christmas\" is writer\/director Preston A. Whitmore's contribution to the season, and a huge step forward from \"Crossover\" of his last year (poorly received and sitting as #7 in the worst films on IMDB).\n\nMa'Dere is a divorced mother of five adult children and one teenage boy. She has her own secret (quietly living with and dating Pastor Joseph, who moves out just as the kids all start to come home for the holidays); oldest son Quentin doesn't approve, but doesn't snitch out mom. The other kids all have their dreams and issues. Baby, the youngest, wants to be a singer, but mom isn't keen (dad was an absent father being a musician). Lisa's husband is cheating on her; her sister Kelli discovers this and busts him to Lisa. Claude's white, pregnant wife is hidden in a hotel during the visit. Mel shows up with her latest boyfriend of the week. You get the idea.\n\nOver the course of the visit, secrets are exposed and all the drama (and fixin's) of a family reunited for the holidays that you'd expect. The stories for each are fairly diverse, though none are unique and the resolutions are simple and, if and when the film chooses to do so, easy to tidy up into a neat, ready-for-gift-giving package.\n\nThe problems are amusing, though, and because it's not happening to you or me, it's funny. The film starts off slowly, and it takes nearly half the film's two-hour run to really pick up to a pace where I stopped looking at my watch. By then, it felt almost as though there were too many people, stories, and issues to pour through in the last hour, given it takes nearly the first hour just to get them onto the table.\n\nI couldn't help but feel a connection -- positively or otherwise -- for each of the main family characters and Pastor Joseph, so the time and presentation of the characters was done well enough.\n\nTwo of the subplots were only glazed over that I wouldn't have minded seeing more of here. The topic of African Americans relative to military service was only hinted at with Claude, who also presents us with the pregnant, secret white wife. Some of the other storylines seems overly done, but I would have enjoyed seeing these a bit more in the forefront, rather than feeling like it was merely a backstory tossed in to give the fifth child some controversy and a story.\n\nIf you're looking for cinematic genius, this isn't the answer. For the rest of us, \"This Christmas\" is a decent film and worth the two hours in your seat if you're even the slightest bit interested in the story or any of the actors and actresses who grace the screen."}

{"text":"Despite the moral gray that bathes the themes and plot of this film, the neo-noir look of the film and the odd characters are so fantastically executed that the film is an immersion into a strange and dark world that is creatively fleshed out. As a genre piece it succeeds immensely; as something more, it falls slightly short."}
{"text":"Now that we know something of the visions, allusions, and conceits behind Matthew Barney's Cremaster Cycle, it's important to acknowledge that you will, in all likelihood, scarcely be able to juggle all of its metaphors as the nearly seven-hour epic unfurls. This art-world novice spent most of his marathon screening barely moving on from an extensive game of \"Spot That Reproductive Organ,\" as far as decoding its symbolism goes. So let's forget about its conceptual merits for a while, because while The Cremaster Cycle is undeniably a textbook example of the barely scrutable piece of video art, it is also a thoroughly cinematic experience.\n\nBut\/so, are they good movies? I'll give you five answers, in sequential (if scatologically descending) order: no, god yes, yes!, only after it's over, and sort of but not really. The success of each Cremaster film basically correlates with Matthew Barney's experience and confidence behind the camera, which grows in leaps and bounds from Cremaster 1 and 4 (from 1995 and 1994, respectively) to the operatic bombast of the three-hour Cremaster 3 (2002).\n\nCremaster 1 is the most technically and symbolically rudimentary of the five films, but it's a crucial introduction to the basic visual vocabulary of the Cycle. In it, two Goodyear blimps hang over the blue Astroturf football field of former-athlete Barney's hometown of Boise, Idaho. On the field, dancers with creepy plastic smiles (\u00e0 la David Lynch fantasies from Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire) gather in varying formations representing female reproductive organs; above, bored stewardesses smoke and mill about the two blimp cabins, identical save for the color of grapes that fill a table; in a womblike space under the table, a bombshell writhes in her constricted space, yanking grapes down from above her, which then fall out through the heel of her shoe in formations mirroring the action on the football field (you'll chuckle at the very early CGI). The soundtrack is a mundane din on the blimp, and a jaunty orchestral score on the field.\n\nThe problem with the short (40-minute) piece, apart from that barely anything happens, is that its bold colors and arresting visuals are undercut by a student filmmaker's sense of framing and timing. The cross-cutting is choppy and random, the sound editing is worse, and the theoretical magnificence of the dancers on the football field is hampered by the limited shot selection used to explore this space.\n\nCREMASTER 2\n\nCremaster 2 (1999), on the other hand, is an atmospheric, dimly lit, and barely coherent stunner. Not that you'll get it, but the plot connects Gary Gilmore's 1977 murder of a gas station attendant to a covered-in-bees Johnny Cash (who, as played by Morbid Angel singer Steve Tucker, called Gilmore on the night of his execution) to Harry Houdini, who, as played by Norman Mailer(!), may have been Gilmore's grandfather.\n\nNone of this is terribly important, because it's all awesomely portrayed. Dig Barney, playing Gilmore and looking like an eyeless Ted Kaczynski, spends untold minutes stuck in an (again, womblike) vehicle at a gas station, molding something out of Vaseline(\/semen) before murdering a poor attendant named Max. Bask in the stunning execution sequence where horses and, later, buffalo reenact the exercise in formation Cremaster 1's dancers did, this time in an Arctic landscape (dig that cloud cervix!) guided by Mounties and American police, in the midst of which Barney rides a bull. Watch the severe Victorian-seeming woman in a black veil ask Mailer-as-Houdini, \"How did you fare tonight . . . with your metamorphosis?\" The soundtrack throughout shifts from horror-movie organ music to the bustle of bees to a country two-step. Cremaster 2 proceeds with the logic and hallucinatory vividness of a fever dream."}
{"text":"Menu\n\nFIGHT CLUB\n\n\"You are not your job. You are not how much you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You are not the contents of your wallet. You are not your khakis. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. What happens first is you can't sleep. What happens then is there's a gun in your mouth. What happens next is you meet Tyler Durden. Let me tell you about Tyler. He had a plan. In Tyler we trusted. Tyler says the things you own, end up owning you. It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything. Fight Club represents that kind of freedom...\"\n\nGeneration-Xers often feel alienated in our society. Performance and consumerism are supposed to motivate us, but what kind of value system is that? Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working at jobs we hate so we can afford shit we don't need. TV makes us believe that money and beauty and big cars will make us happy. Our generation, born and raised through the 70s and 80s, hasn't been given any religious, social or moral model. We are too young to have been in a great war, there was no major economical crisis. Our war is a spiritual war, the Great Depression is our lives. It used to be that men were providers for their families, and hopefully entities prompt to do the right thing. And now the only thing that matters in America is how much money you can make, and how close you can get to a movie star lifestyle. Urgh.\n\nReality check: TV's wrong. There's very little chance any of us will end up a millionaire, a movie god or a rock star. You're just gonna strive and do shit you have nothing but contempt for and just get some lousy, unfulfilling existence. Sure, you might be able to kinda convince yourself it's all good, you got the car and the lawn you mown on Sundays, and you look oh-so-cool in your khakis, just like those dancing kids in the ads, right? But deep down inside, we know there's gotta be something better to live for. This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.\n\n\"Fight Club\" is an absolutely amazing movie, as subversive as it gets. It's a wonder it ever got made, especially by a major studio. This masterpiece is a picture that screams for people to wake up and revolt against the absurdity of modern life. Of course it's gathering controversy. It's anti-capitalism, borderline nihilistic and downright anarchist, for sure. Some might even say that it's anti-God, and not quite without evidence. But ain't that what movies are about? Art is supposed to make you think, to push you to react. It shouldn't leave you indifferent. These days everyone blames movies for violence in our society. Don't stop selling guns to kids (that's big money), but turn every movie into Disney sap to shut people up for a while. Maybe they'll keep ignoring that Nike is exploiting kids to pay Michael Jordan, that automobile moguls will recall cars only if it'll cost less than settling malfunction cases out of court, that you gotta kill half-extinct species of whales to make classy perfume... If we stop making movies with violence just in case some moron might screw up (which he would probably have done anyway), cinema will become a travesty of reality, and we'll be deprived of many potential masterpieces. If violence had never been in movies, there would have been no \"A Clockwork Orange\" or \"Taxi Driver\"; we're talking about some of the greatest movies ever made!\n\n\"Fight Club\" revolves around an unnamed Narrator, a disillusioned office worker who's so fed up with his routine life that he can't even sleep anymore. He's trying to find satisfaction in shopping, turning his crummy apartment into an Ikea catalog spread, but it's just so... Urgh. The only way he gets to connect with other people is by going to self-help groups for people with testicular cancer, brain parasites or whatever. It seems people really care about you only if they think you're gonna die. That's in one of these meetings that he meets Marla, a chain-smoking Goth mermaid who hangs in these sessions because it's cheaper than the movies and there's free coffee. Suddenly, our Narrator can't let go anymore by crying in the arms of other men, because the presence of another faker keeps reminding him he's one too. This ain't the last he'll see of Marla. She's about to influence drastically his life, but not nearly as much as Tyler Durden, an intriguing fellow who's everything he's not. Confident and charismatic, Tyler is an all-out anarchist who refuses to submit to the compromises of modern life. He splices frames of erected penises into family films when he works as a projectionist, pees in the soup when he's a waiter. And he makes soap, too.\n\nThe Narrator finds himself intensely driven to Tyler and his radical thinking. They find that the best way to feel alive might be by beating the living shit out of each other. Soon, other people join in. Lotsa people. Fight clubs multiply, all over the nation. Seems today's emasculated men are relieved to finally find a venue to unleash their frustration. They're so numbed by their lives that they're desperate to feel something, anything. Even if it means going at it in underground boxing clubs. Tyler takes it to the next phase by turning his fight clubs into units of Project Mayhem. And then it gets weird. Yeah, weirder than what you saw so far! I really can't tell you anymore about the plot (even though the trailer gives away a lot more, as do some critics). The first rule of fight club is: You don't talk about fight club. The second rule of fight club is: You don't talk about fight club.\n\nThe film's protagonist and narrator is played by Edward Norton, who goes beyond anything he's done. There is so much nuance and intelligence in his unpredictable, always compelling performance. Brad Pitt is another very interesting actor, and he truly gives everything he's got as Tyler Durden. Believe me, Tyler will crawl under your skin and stay there. I can hardly think of a more fascinating movie character. What's the most disturbing about Tyler and the film in general is how it seduces you with its nihilistic philosophy, how it makes you relate to, understand and admire Tyler Durden... And then before you know it, you realize that you would have done anything, no matter how immoral and depraved, just because you had so much faith in him.\n\nThe movie is a frightening look at how any \"normal\" person could turn into a member of an extremist group. It shows how seductive anarchy and marginality can be at first, but it's also responsible enough to also show how these things often get out of hand and go too far. This movie makes you understand why some turn into terrorists, why some take part in a death cult, why Germans followed blindly Hitler and committed some of the most atrocious acts in history. This is a movie that should be shown to everyone in schools to be discussed. This is a movie as powerful and thought provoking as \"Do the Right Thing\" or \"Schindler's List\". And it's a comedy, too. One of the first things people too shaken by the issues of the film might talk about to lighten the mood might be the casting of rock star Meatloaf as Big Bob, a former bodybuilder who took so much steroids that he grew huge breasts and was deprived of his balls (literally). Or how shocking to see Helena Bonham Carter acting without wearing a corset, turning herself into the trashy Marla. Kudos to Carter for achieving to make Marla somehow endearing.\n\nThe film was adapted by newcomer Jim Uhls from the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. The book is incredibly rich and inventive: it's almost scientific in its details. Can the movie live up to it? Astonishingly, yes. Director David Fincher found the way to communicate through images and sound the vibe Palahniuk sent through words. This ain't your middle of the road studio picture. The film might seem difficult to some, because it's so packed with ideas and doesn't dumb down or sugar coat them. It has the bleak look of decay and filth also found in Fincher's previous films, but it also has a refreshing playfulness. I saw \"Fight Club\" twice in a row on opening day, and I got to notice tons of nifty details each time. Like how there's subliminal images of Tyler in the first act, as well as a frame of a penis spliced into the ending, and a bunch of other subtle things.\n\nI also really like the film's non-linear structure, how it constantly jumps back and forth in time and space, like a novel actually. The editing is particularly audacious and inventive. Let's not forget the Dust Brothers: finally, a film score that sounds truly modern instead of sticking to the same tired faux-Wagner strings and brass. Their electronic, loop and sample woven, genre blending music makes the film even more electrifying. \"Fight Club\" is pure, unrestrained, riveting filmmaking. And if you think that \"The Sixth Sense\" had a fall-off-your-seat climactic twist, wait till you see what Palahniuk concocted. More than just a surprise, it's a revelation that puts everything else in perspective, and makes it even scarier. The sequence that follows is therefore even more thrilling, as... Well, you'll see. Oh, and you gotta love the final shot, a wonderfully ironic anti-happy end perfectly edited to the Pixies' Where is My Mind.\n\n\"Fight Club\" burns ideas in your brain, thrills you with its fights, makes you laugh and uses the art of filmmaking in a whole new way. This is one for the ages. In Fight Club we trust."}
{"text":"UNCONVENTIONAL WEEK \u2013 Kick-Ass\n\nIn my eternal pursuit to keep you off-balance, I'm breaking out a Theme Week this week. The theme? Movies Roger and I love despite their nontraditional nature. The goal will be to figure out, to our best estimation, why these movies which strayed from conventional storytelling practices still worked. It's also a very busy week, so expect updates at weird unpredictable times. I wouldn't be surprised if all 4 of my reviews popped up at 3 a.m. Thursday morning. Roger starts us off with a movie he loved, \"Kick-Ass.\" Feel free to go back and enjoy my review of the script afterwards. :)\n\nGenre: Action Comedy Premise: Dave Lizewski is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan who decides to become a vigilante. About: Kick-Ass is Matthew Vaughn's third directing effort (behind Layer Cake and Stardust). What some people don't know about Vaughn is that before he became a director, he was Guy Ritchie's producer, producing such films as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Kick-Ass stars Nicolas Cage and McLovin, as well as Chloe Moretz and Aaron Johnson. Writers: Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn Director: Matthew Vaughn\n\nArt is partly to entertain, but partly also to upset. You need those two. That's vital to keep our society alive. \u2013Yann Martel\n\nThis movie so offended Professor Stark, that he leaned over to me at one point and gesticulated, \"This is fucking depraved.\" I would have laughed at him, but I was too dazed to reply.\n\nKick-Ass shocked you into Stendhal syndrome, Rog?\n\nI remember the moment in the theater when I started to shake.\n\nMy hands were trembling, and if I wasn't captivated by what was happening on the screen, I would know that my lungs had tightened and that my heart was beating faster. My nervous system was having a definite reaction to the images and noises my brain was trying to process.\n\nSure, I was on the edge of my seat when Kick Ass and Big Daddy were being tortured on live television by goons who were working for the villain, the local mob boss. As they were being dramatically bludgeoned with every type of weapon imaginable, I asked myself, \"Is that the same backdrop they used in one of the torture scenes in Scarface?\"\n\nOur heroes were up shit creek, and the tension was milked for all it was worth. These guys were going to die on live television. But at every showing I was, all the audience members knew that Hit Girl was going to arrive anytime now. Sure, Red Mist shot her in the chest and the last time we saw her she had fallen into an alleyway, but we knew that she was trained by her father to take bullets in the chest. My friend leaned over to me and said, \"Man, that girl is going to show up and rape all of these guys.\"\n\nThe power cuts out, the characters watching the online feed can't see anything. And suddenly night vision goggles flick on. The sound reminded me of that terrifying sequence in Silence of the Lambs when Buffalo Bill is stalking Clarice Starling through the pitch darkness of his house. But then I noticed a HUD.\n\nIt reminded me of several videogames, specifically first-person shooters. Doom to Quake to Counter Strike to the USP with tactical knife attachment in Modern Warfare 2.\n\nYep, Hit Girl was here to save the day, and we watch through the eyes of a child who has been honed into a brutal vigilante by her father as she starts killing everyone in the room.\n\nBut then, the goons set her father on fire and a familiar song starts to play. I'm thinking, is this from the Sunshine soundtrack? This sounds a lot like Kanada's Death Part 2. Holy shit it, is! I've listened to this song tons of times while I wrote.\n\nAnd that's about the point my geek brain starts to melt and I haven't seen a firefight so emotional since John Woo's The Killer. This shit is epic on a Ripley fighting the Queen level.\n\nWell, it didn't read like that on the page, Rog\u2026\n\nOf course it didn't.\n\nThose were just blue prints for the sound and the fury as told by filmmakers who knew exactly what they were doing. We didn't have the performances of the actors, the soundtrack that triggered references to other movies and struck chords in the heart and mind and we didn't have all the millions of flourishes performed by camera operators and film editors and costume designers and art designers and every single person that added their sweat and blood to the movie.\n\nKick-Ass is a screenplay that every studio hated. I can only imagine their reactions when they read it. It was probably a litany of, \"No no no no no!\" \"Why is there a twelve year-old girl massacring people in this? You can't have that! You have to change it!\" \"This thing changes perspective two-thirds of the way through! You have to change it!\" \"You can't have a twelve year old girl say the word CUNT!\"\n\nCarson even rated it a [x] Wasn't For Me.\n\nI was blown away by the movie the first time I saw it. In fact, I saw it two more times the same week. I treated several friends to it, paying for their tickets, because they didn't think it was going to be a good movie.\n\nIt looks so strange. How can it possibly work?\n\nNicholas Cage gives such an oddball performance, like he became the host body for the ghost of Christopher Walken, who in turn invited along the iconic television spirits of Adam West and William Shatner. And what a bizarre ride it is, with his weird fucking mannerisms that elevate theatrical camp to inscrutable avant-garde. In probably any other movie fantasy circumstance, you would hate this character for what he subjects his daughter Mindy to, running her through a reverse-Clockwork Orange gauntlet, absolutely ruining her life by sharpening her into a tool of vengeance, brainwashed by comic books, videogames and John Woo movies. You would call the guy a douchebag and applaud loudly when he dies.\n\nExcept, the guy has a reason for doing it. He's an honorable cop that was fucked over by Frank D'Amico. His backstory inseminates empathy into the heart of the audience. Prior to his backstory, Big Daddy feels like a mystery, a puzzle piece. But then, his origin story is appropriately told through the device he used to brainwash Mindy, a comic book. And his origin story breaks the sympathy hymen. We start to feel for Damon Macready when we see how D'Amico's scheme sends him to prison with a disgraced reputation, we start to feel sorry and care for Macready when we see his wife commit suicide as an escape from her despair and loneliness.\n\nBy association, we think of these tragic circumstances and Mindy's birth, and although she's already a loveable character, we want to see her take up the mantle and turn her family's bad fortune around. When Big Daddy perishes, his mission not complete, he passes the baton to this little girl he poured all of his dreams into, including his vengeance. And isn't that what parents are supposed to do? To dream a better life for their children, or to dream so big their goals can only be completed by a generational passing on of the flame?\n\nBy the time Mindy is knocking down the castle doors of D'Amico's uptown stronghold set to the theme of A Few Dollars More, we have to stop and think what we're really about to see. Are we really about to see a twelve-year old girl, armed to the teeth, walk solo into a secure condo full of mob enforcers? And we already know Mindy is like one of those spy-thriller assassins who has been wiped clean and programmed via secret government experiments, except she's the freakish, geeky and bizarro Marvel Max Universe version of that. And we can't forget, she's a fucking twelve year old girl! Isn't at least some part of your brain curious about what that sequence looks like? And if you've made it this far into the movie, isn't your heart invested in the fact whether she's going to be able to complete her father's mission? I'm not even talking about the possibility of her dying. She's willing to make that sacrifice. But is your heart involved in her journey of vengeance? If the answer is no, then maybe you don't like revenge stories.\n\nAnd what about Dave Lizewski?\n\nLook, I have friends that are staunch superhero fans and refuse to see the movie. One has a compelling reason. She's a huge Avengers fangirl. I remember talking to her and she said, \"I just can't do it. It's not what I read superhero comics for.\" And you know, I can understand that. Some people like their superhero stories and themes preserved in the purity that comes with the nostalgic and kid-friendly Marvel Universe.\n\nThey think Kick-Ass satirizes the world of superhero comics and its fans sans the courage, sans the heroics, sans the message that an ordinary person can rise up out of everyday circumstances and do something extraordinary. They think it's just being ugly, potty-mouthed, catering to immature fanboys, and making fun. Well, if they sat down to watch it, they would see that the movie would not work if it didn't have this courage, this heroism, this, \"I'm an ordinary person but I am truly capable of super-heroic things.\"\n\nIt's a satirical, perhaps lunatic brew that possesses the same heart of the superhero tales that makes them mythic, iconic. The same blood pumps through Kick-Ass that makes our modern superhero mythology sacred.\n\nDave has a genuine sense of justice that seems hardwired into him, just like it may be hardwired into all of us. A moral, instinctual sense of right and wrong. How do we know? He doesn't like being mugged. He doesn't like seeing his friends being mugged. We see how upset he gets, that Travis Bickle inner-outrage bubbling underneath his skin when he witnesses lowlifes steal, cheat and murder.\n\nIt's moving when he defends a man against a trio of thugs and says his name for the first time. Isn't that weird? In any other circumstance, it would probably be cheesy. But here, it works. Out of breath, brutalized, but still fighting, he says with conviction through a bloody mouth, \"I'm Kick-Ass.\"\n\nWhy does it work?\n\nBecause it's a nerdy kid with a sense of justice, who is tired of watching people be mistreated, who puts his life and the line and takes a stand for something he believes in. It's an act of courage, of heroism, and that speaks to our hearts. And no matter how campy it can be, there's something that still resonates with us.\n\nThe structure of the screenplay feels weird. It's handicapped by the superhero origin structure, but the third act feels like it's more about Hit Girl than Kick-Ass. If I wrote a spec that changed perspective and focus two-thirds of the way through, I'd be crucified on the spec market.\n\nMaybe. But it doesn't really matter. Vaughn and Goldman are making a movie, they're not trying to sell a screenplay to a production company or studio.\n\nAnd plus, it works.\n\nThe focus is flipping over to a character we haven't quite seen before. Perhaps Hit Girl's closest filmic prototype is Mathilda of Luc Besson's Leon, but only after she's been strained through a filter of Wuxia tales and first-person shooters. She has a strong heritage of badass female characters, everyone from Ripley of the Alien films to the femme fatales in Kill Bill, but the difference is we've never seen someone so young, someone that only a pedophile would view as an object of desire.\n\nShe's unique.\n\nAs such, we are itching to watch this diminutive killer unleash hell on all of her enemies. Even if takes her half an hour of screen time, we are willing to watch her do this. If we were switching to a lesser character, this perspective and focus shift would be a miscalculation, indeed. The movie would collapse on itself and would become victim to our ever diminishing attention spans.\n\nCarson writes about the difficulties in crafting an origin story in the traditional three act structure. He posits that in most screenplays, the first act is about setting up the main problem the protagonist has to contend with. But with the superhero origin story, this main problem gets postponed until later in the story because the first act is all about introducing the character and how he becomes a hero.\n\nWell, what's wrong with that?\n\nMost of origin stories do both at the same time. While we're introduced to Dave and his metamorphosis into Kick-Ass, we're also introduced to Frank D'Amico, the mob boss, and the problem he's having with some very good vigilantes. Isn't that the introduction of the main problem? Everything is set up, and I can look at the structure of the movie and break down the three acts into three ideas: The first act shows us the dangers of being a vigilante in the real world; the second act is about smart, deadly vigilantes who are capable of heroics, and the third act becomes a paean to full-blown, mind-blowing superheroics we read about in comic books.\n\nAnd although the third act focuses largely on Hit Girl, Dave must make a decision to accept responsibility and become a true hero. His actions have plowed through the city, exposing vigilantes who were effective in crippling a local mafia, and as a result his call-to-arms has gotten people killed, including Big Daddy. His courageous actions have tragic consequences, and instead of throwing in the cape, he chooses to accept these consequences by continuing to stand up for what he believes in, and in the process redeems himself by aiding Hit Girl in the completion of her mission (Dave is the audience's avatar for this crazy world).\n\nThere's a universal lesson there.\n\nSometimes, when we do the right thing, there's collateral damage. When that happens, we can let fear take over, we can stop. We stop believing in ourselves. We begin to doubt. We let our dreams and goals die on the vine because we're afraid of the consequences. The thing is, that's usually the moment we have to keep pushing forward.\n\nAnd that's what Dave does.\n\nEven in the face of doubting his own abilities, he continues to do the right thing.\n\nThe resolution is bloody, exciting, offensive, entertaining and satisfying. Hit Girl blazes and slices and dices her way through rooms and corridors full of bad guys. Dave gets to save her from a bazooka attack with jet-pack Gatling guns. Hit Girl goes head-to-head against the man who is responsible for the deaths of her mother and father, and Kick-Ass goes up against Red Mist. For a hymn to comic books, superheroes, John Woo movies, Sergio Leone and revenge sagas, the movie delivers on all fronts, emotionally and kinetically.\n\nIt's a successful mash-up for fans of superhero origin comics and the cinema of violence.\n\n[x] impressive\n\nWhat I learned: When Carson told me we would be doing another Theme Week, he presented me with a list of movies he chose that tell their stories in a slightly untraditional manner. Part of me thought, well, what's traditional? The other part of me knew what he meant. As a guy who studies modern spec screenplays, you could say I pay attention to mechanics, to formula, to pattern. If I read a screenplay and I feel that something isn't working, I'll dig in and try and find out why: nine times out of ten it's because someone doesn't have their storytelling basics down. Or they miscalculated and made a decision that hurts the story.\n\nBut it goes both ways.\n\nIn the screenplay world, there are oftentimes when the story isn't allowed to just be the story. People will come in with different opinions, and they want to change it, make it adhere to Joseph Campbell or some narrative pattern that can feel by-the-numbers and cookie cutter.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nYou should listen to these people. Sometimes they're right.\n\nBut sometimes, they're wrong.\n\nI wonder if a great screenplay guarantees a good movie. I remember reading Law Abiding Citizen and thinking, man, this is fucking awesome! Then I remember watching the movie and thinking, man, what happened!\n\nI don't think there's a form of storytelling that is subject to more scrutiny than a screenplay. But it makes sense. They're blueprints. You don't drop millions of dollars into a building without studying the blueprints to make sure it's sound and free of error.\n\nBut that's something we ought to remember.\n\nScreenplays are just blueprints for light and sound.\n\nAnd sometimes, the sound and the fury jumps off the page like a miracle, defying people and narrative weaknesses they calculated as odds, and the celluloid burns like a star that induces Stendhal syndrome if you stare at it directly."}

An elderly woman and her daughter are humiliated when offered a present of one million kroner from a relative. I Belong is a warm and nuanced film about people who all mean well, but end up hurting one another.

{"text":"Sleepless Night\n\nSynopsis\n\nA cop with a connection to the criminal underworld finds his secret life exposed when he and his partner are caught stealing cocaine from a powerful drug dealer, a move that puts his son's life in jeopardy.\n\nNothing of great substance here: Corrupt cop steals duffel full of cocaine. Drug lord kidnaps cop's son. Bag goes missing. (The tagline puts it more efficiently: \"He took their drugs. They took his son.\") Nothing we haven't seen 1,000 times before, but damned if this isn't a tight piece of thriller craftsmanship, helped by the restrictions of a nightclub setting that becomes the Nakatomi Plaza of this scenario. As commercial French thrillers go, this puts the vast majority of Besson productions to shame.\n\nI hate to sum up a movie in a vague, immature burst of excitement, but I'll make an exception for SLEEPLESS NIGHT, so here goes:\n\nHoly fucking shit!\n\nThat's basically the reaction I keep coming back to thinking about the movie. It's explosive, unexpected and just one of the best action films in a while (and that's saying something, considering that we've been treated to a number of truly great action cinema recently).\n\nVincent is a police officer who also dabbles in stealing drugs. On one faithful morning, a heist goes wrong. As a result, Vincent gets recognized and the owner of the drugs, Jose, kidnaps Vincent's son as leverage. Vincent then sets out to get his son back and\u2026\n\nA frenetic French action film that never stops moving, an obstacle course with a desperate crooked cop trying to get his son back from a sketchy nightclub owner. I was hooked from the start, this guy goes through pure hell. It looked like the actors did most of their own stunts aswell. I liked the ambigious ending, even though it's a big trend in foreign film. Check this one out.A lean, mean French action thriller that combines the sweaty desperation of Die Hard with the corruption and duplicity of good film noir. Tomar Sisley plays the corrupt cop whose robbery of a drug lord comes back to bite him when his son is taken hostage by the guys he ripped off. Now he has to make his way through the labyrinthine nightclub where his son is being held while avoiding all the shady characters trying to stop him.\n\nIt's a can't-miss premise with high stakes and the film makes the most of it as every setpiece involves our \"hero\" seeing his options dwindle and his desperation rise. The antagonists are mostly cardboard cutouts of Scarface type gangsters and don't\u2026\n\nPretty fun movie, but not really on the same level as Taken (which the pseudo byline was: Taken in a night club). Great action scenes, but how the entire film was contained to a single location was a bit unbelievable.\n\nProps to some thrilling action sequences, the kitchen smackdown was a joy to watch. Sadly though the rest of the film doesn't be enough to separate itself from the dozens cookie-cutter thrillers like this we get each year."}
{"text":"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\nIt's 1920s Southern Ireland, and the dreaded Black and Tans are terrorising the country. Damien (Murphy) is all set to go to London to be a doctor when one of his best friends is murdered for not saying his name in English. His brother (Delaney) pleads with him to join the section of the IRA he runs, in retaliation for the killing. When Damien witnesses another unmovitated attack by the 'Tans, he takes his brother up on the offer. The Wind That Shakes The Barely is an undeniably powerful and challenging film, but it doesn't really resonate cinematically the way it could have. Ken Loach, a director whom the term 'realism' was pretty much invented for, uses extremely long takes and allows his actors to fluff their lines without cutting - evidently because that's what real. While it's worked to startling effect before, the period setting here damages his much-celebrated minimalist style. The acting is outstanding all 'round, Murphy and Delaney anchoring the film with two superb turns as the conflicting brothers who have little in common but patriotism; yet, unfortunately not one other character is used to purposeful effect. Liam Cunningham's Dan ostensibly serves as someone to merely support whatever Damien says; a shame, because Cunningham is tremendous and deserved more than such an under-written role. Having said all that, the actual history involved here is undeniably absorbing and it's a very brave film for a British director to make. The subject matter never ceases to be anything other than enthralling, but the plot unfolds so leisurely that you become almost bored with the characters; there appears to be a lack of immediacy about them, which is essential for characters involved with a subject matter such as this. Barley could have been much better - but still, there are few more noble films that you're likely to see"}

{"text":"You know how sometimes a glimpse of a landscape (or in this case a landscape and several hastily rolled burritos) from a movie gets you itching to travel off somewhere new and wonderful?\n\n\"Sin Nombre\" did that to me a few years ago. No, I do not dream of encountering wayfaring gang members. Yes, the movie does depict poverty and violence, and is at times alarming. Please let me refer you to this article for details on why that won't deter me from travelling to Mexico.\n\nNow back to the wanderlust. Towards the beginning of the movie, when the main character Sayra is semi-arguing with her father about making the trip to the USA, my heart wrenched for her plight but my eyes stayed glued to the city landscape in the background. They were hanging out on what looked like a rooftop patio. I am obsessed with rooftop patios. My eyes continued to focus on what was behind people while they were talking in the film rather than the actors themselves. Maybe that's why I've watched this film so many times, I always see something new, even if it's what I was meant to see the first time.\n\nIt will come to a shock to no one that every wall in every room in this film was painted in colorful blues, reds, and oranges, and I love painted walls. The landscape around them was just as colorful. Since the movie spends a lot of time following people sitting on tops of train cars (see photo above), the audience was afforded beautiful views of the Mexican landscape for a decent portion of the film. Maybe beauty isn't what director Cary Fukunaga was trying to convey, but I'd argue that it was. For one, who wants to watch an ugly movie? Even if the topic is gruesome. And then, of course, the bond that develops between main characters Sayra and her unlikely and begrudging savior, Willy, is the crux of the story.\n\nEvery time I watch this movie, I realize someone needs to light fire to my ass on this whole \"learning Spanish\" thing.\n\nI'll leave you with the trailer, which my mom will probably watch and decide I can never go to Mexico unless I'm at an all-inclusive, touristified \"safe\" resort, to which I'll spend time reassuring her (hi mom!) but we'll both realize I'm in my mid-20s now and she will eventually trust me:"}

{"text":"One sure way to tell that \"The Sessions\" is bound to be an exceptional movie is that the subject of it sounds like nothing anyone would want to see. The story of a man in an iron lung who decides that he wants to experience sex in his life could not have gotten funding on its premise alone. Obviously, there had to be something there, and there is.\n\n\"The Sessions\" is moving. At times, it's even erotic, which is unexpected to say the least. It sends viewers out of the theater with a heightened sense of the physical and a real feeling for all the things that sex means in human life.\n\n\"The Sessions\" goes beyond what movies usually deal with when they talk about love \u2014 attraction, the mating dance, the happily-ever-after. It's about people's most basic need to connect, express and feel through sexuality. The film is raw and adult and, in the least somber way imaginable, unusually dignified.\n\nBased on the real-life story of Mark O'Brien, a Bay Area poet and journalist who died in 1999, it dramatizes a period in the 1980s when, at 38, O'Brien hired a sex therapist. Among the ancillary revelations of \"The Sessions,\" for those of us previously in ignorance, is that hands-on sex therapy is nothing like prostitution.\n\nPart therapist, part sex partner, part life coach, the therapist (Helen Hunt) ministers to a severely disabled patient and makes him feel as if he's part of the world. She helps bring him into the world. If anything this is like missionary work.\n\nAs played by John Hawkes, O'Brien is a sweet and witty person who wants to get as much out of life as he can.\n\nA polio victim, he can only move his head and needs the iron lung to breathe, though he can go as long as three hours outside of it. He is about as physically limited as a person can be, but with all the longings, even the romantic longings, of an able-bodied person.\n\nWritten and directed by Ben Lewin, \"The Sessions\" is most impressive in the way its tone harmonizes a whole range of different scenes and moods. The scenes between the devout O'Brien and his parish priest (William H. Macy), in which he discusses his plans to pursue sex therapy, are funny in a straightforward comic way. But the sex therapy scenes \u2014 the sessions that give the film its title \u2014 are clinical, explicit and wrenching.\n\nPeople will leave the theater talking about Hawkes, about the role's physical difficulty, Hawkes' emotional nakedness, and the way he conveys, just in his demeanor, a history of lifelong disability. But this is a movie with two remarkable performances, and in \"The Sessions\" Hunt gets her best screen opportunity in years."}

{"text":"Flash Movie Review: Emperor\n\nThe stranger standing ahead of me started yelling when he heard me tell the checker I picked Argo to win for best picture. He said the film was a total lie. I told him it was a movie not a documentary. In response to his claim that people would believe the movie's story was true, I told him he did not have to worry; with people barely reading and writing these days, they would not remember the story. It was the perfect thing to say to him because he calmed down. As he walked away, the checker rolled her eyes. History lessons via movies are an acceptable form in my opinion. However, I understand the writers and director can take liberties with the story, to make it more compelling for the viewer. Like most things these days, one always needs a fact checker. From a historical standpoint, I found this movie's story attractive. With Japan's surrender ending WWII, the fate of the country would be determined by General Douglas MacArthur, played by Tommy Lee Jones (Lincoln, In the Valley of Elah). As supreme commander of the occupying forces, General MacArthur would have to determine if Emperor Hirohito should be tried as a war criminal. The job of finding evidence against the Emperor became the responsibility of General Bonner Fellers, played by Matthew Fox (We Are Marshall, Lost-TV). His job was complicated by his determination in locating Aya Shimada, played by Eriko Hatsune (Norwegian Wood, Spiral), the Japanese exchange student he met back in college. The movie had too much to handle in the story department. If it would have focused either on General MacArthur or on General Fellers' story, the movie would have been more interesting. I do not know why people have been saying this was Tommy Lee's best performance since LIncoln because it was absolutely not. I found him to be one dimensional, though part of the fault falls on the poor script. The scenes that had to do with history kept my attention. As for the rest it left me cold"}

Luis Galindo, her teenage boyfriend, can choose between two families: the gangster brotherhood that can elevate him from invisible to powerful, or his illegal immigrant father, Carlos, who craves the invisibility that keeps him safe.\n\nIn this intense and deeply moving film (rated PG-13 for violence, drug use, and language), Carlos (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) gambles that invisibility to buy his boss' landscaping truck and with it-so the boss wheedles him-\"the American dream.\" Carlos agonizes over the risk of owning a vehicle without a driver's license, when a broken taillight or a crash could send him back to Mexico. When the truck is stolen, Carlos sheds his fear to find it. Luis (Jos\u00e9 Juli\u00e1n) comes too, on a journey that reacquaints father and son with each other and with their past.\n\nBichir and Juli\u00e1n give subtle and believable performances. The film's tension comes from impossible odds and stakes that are heartbreakingly high. They have no choice but to trust people who may betray them for a $50 bill or who may, like Carlos, still hold on to kindness in the face of poverty and fear.\n\nIt is difficult to tell if the title, A Better Life, is meant to be ironic. In one mute and appealing montage, Carlos looks out the truck's window and watches the scene change from the palm trees and swimming pools of the neighborhoods where he works to the peeling buildings and loitering thugs of the neighborhood where he lives. The search for a \"better life\" banishes Carlos to a state of silent panic; one stumble and the road could lead right back to where he started.\n\nWhy, Luis demands, would he want to add to the fear and increase the deprivation by taking care of a kid? Because \"a better life\" may also mean that even the hardest life is better when you have someone to work for and love."}

They are the self-defined \"hipsters,\" dancing to swing and small combo dance bands in fashions that defies the uniformity of the Soviet ideal. \"I can't understand why everyone doesn't want to live like everyone else,\" smiles the youth commissar of conformity, who proclaims that \"Every hipster is a potential criminal.\" Mels (Anton Shagin, who comes off as a wide-eyed Neil Patrick Harris) is part of the conformist army until he switches allegiances for the best of possible reasons: a girl, Polly (Oksana Akinshina). Mels dons the Soviet answer to a zoot suit, hits the Broadway scene and is rechristened Mel (in the Yankee-ization that all hipsters undergo), the newest member of the swing cat underground.\n\nA musical (where they do indeed break into song and dance, evoking the mechanization of the industrial revolution when it's the plebian citizens doing the honors but exploding in the plumage of mating birds when the dances erupt in the club setttings), a coming-of-age tale and an adventure in youthful rebellion, Hipsters (from Emerging Master Valery Todorovksy) is a bright blast of underground culture and expressions of individuality in a society where rebels are regularly jailed for much less. The eye-gouging color, flamboyant fashion, pompadours and curls and appropriated style is not just a fashion statement, it's a cry of individualism and freedom in a country where \"kowtowing to western ideology is punishable by up to ten years\" and \"a saxophone is considered a concealed weapon.\" (And what about owning banned music, which here is copied and passed around on pirate discs cut into the remnants of old X-rays sheets?) It's also a warped mirror reflection of what these soviet youths imagine American culture is like from the snatched glimpses and slivers of artifacts gleaned from between the cracks of the Iron Curtain, a recreation at least ten years out of date and exaggerated to hyperbolic extremes. Which, in a very real way, ultimately makes this a uniquely Soviet rebel culture. The drama itself is much more conventional, with kids forced to choose between their rebel identities and donning the costume of conformity for advancement, marriage, parenthood and responsibility, all of it essentially hurdled in a song to embrace the happy ending. But the story of Hipsters is less in the narrative than the evocation of this underground culture, in both the texture of realistic detail and expressionist song and dance sequences. And if you think you recognize Polly (\"Good Time Polly to those who know\"), it's not just the American affection; she starred as Lilya in Lukas Moodyson's Lilya 4-Ever."}

{"text":"'You Instead' review\n\nWhen you spot festivalgoers trudging around fields in Somerset, Yorkshire and elsewhere, it's easy to understand why they make their annual pilgrimages. With wellies on their feet and saucer-wide eyes, a big grin from a filthy reveller shows why it's all worth it - regardless of the unreliable British summer.\n\nMaking that connection on screen has always been harder. From the BBC's admirable attempts to chronicle what's going on every Glastonbury to the seemingly never-ending drag of 1970 Oscar winner Woodstock, sticking music festivals up on screen usually puts a sterile barrier between yourself and the messy goings on.\n\nAs well as being a cute bit of romantic fluff, the rare success of You Instead is how well it translates what it feels like to be young, stupid and rolling around the grass hearing your favourite tunes, all a million miles away from the rest of the world.\n\nShot at T In The Park over five days, the film starts off in a typically stumbling festival fashion. While recording an acoustic track in the back of his van, Adam (Luke Treadaway), the frontman of electropop hipsters The Make, has an altercation with Morello (Natalia Tena), keyboard player in girlband The Dirty Pinks. A kindly festival nutter watches on before deciding to handcuff the pair of them together for their own good. Naturally, they hate each other.\n\nYou can't really blame Morello. As well as being a ringer for Razorlight's Johnny Borrell, Adam is the sort of pompous, preening popstar we all recognise from the celeb pages as much as the hit parade. But as well as his supermodel girlfriend, hairy bandmate and slimy manager, he also has a tender heart which is just waiting for the right girl to dig it out. For her part, Morello is all mouth and underdog arrogance, who wouldn't normally be seen dead with the likes of Adam until she's physically inseparable from him at Scotland's biggest music event.\n\nThere's a smattering of music snippets of varying quality including Biffy Clyro, Paloma Faith, The Proclaimers (of course) and Al Green, but their brevity and the way they're neatly woven into the film doesn't distract from the story. A cameo from Newton Faulkner gives him a great line which will even amuse those of us who never really 'got' his acoustothwack charm.\n\nFor the two fictional groups, Eugene Kelley (he of Kurt Cobain favourites The Vaselines) worked with The Make and fellow Glaswegian Brian McAlpine helped The Dirty Pinks. Both bands seem authentic enough, though it does stretch the credibility of the film a little to have The Bravery soundalikes The Make actually headlining a major fest.\n\nSure, you can see exactly where things are going from pretty early on, but even with the setlist firmly in your mind it's still a hell of a lot of fun running through the hits on the way to the big finale. At a time when \"British romantic comedy\" is usually the biggest health warning you can stick on a movie, You Instead is a really charming film which captures all the magic and mud of the perfect festival experience."}
{"text":"An odd assembly of short films, vignettes, by eleven different directors, morphing into each other, New York, I Love You is not as strong as its companion piece Paris, je t'aime. How can so many good directors -- Fatih Akin and Sheker Kapur among them -- miscalculate here? A short film is like a short story: it has its own form, discipline and craft. But there are misconceptions, such as Kapur's tale of an ageing diva (Julie Christie), a bell hop, and a bunch of violets; or Brett Ratner's ridiculous tale of a prom night virgin. Yvan Atal's encounter between a writer (Ethan Hawke) trying to pick up a glamorous stranger (Maggie Q) outside a restaurant works the form well, as does Mira Nair's tale of a young Hassidic Jewess talking with an Indian diamond trader on her wedding eve. But others play like misconceived one-gag moments. A pity."}

British filmmaker Joe Wright, who directed Knightley in Pride & Prejudice, revels in the challenge of bringing Ian McEwan's panoramic 2001 novel to the screen (particularly breathtaking is the long, intricately choreographed tracking shot that follows Robbie through the chaos of the evacuation of Dunkirk).

{"text":"It's hard to think of a movie that's built up more expectations than Tron Legacy. It was teased three Comic-Cons ago, which is like a century in nerd years, and the teaser made people stand up and cheer even then. Plus, the original movie came out 30 years ago which has given at least two generations of geeks time to elevate it to mythological status in their minds, collect the limited-edition action figures and gloss over any flaws. On top of that, the most popular electronic act in the world, who already dress and act like computer programs, are scoring the movie. It's pretty much guaranteed to disappoint, right? I know some were, but I couldn't pry my eyes off the screen for the entire running time of the movie, and of all the emotions I experienced in the theater, disappointment definitely wasn't one of them.\n\nLike all Coen Brothers movies, True Grit is a solemn blend of comedy and murder, populated by more quirky, funny characters than you can fit in a woodchipper. Obviously, each of their movies is a unique snowflake, and has a slightly heavier balance of one than the other, but it's amazing how they consistently manage to deliver a similar mix of subject matter, or, rather, are drawn to material that has that mix. You could call it formulaic, but when the formula is so delicious, and you drink a big glass of it every time it's put in front of you, all you're doing is calling yourself a big baby. I must be such a babyJeff Bridges is a national treasure. The sheer variety of roles he's played -- computer nerd (Tron), alien (Starman), shock jock (The Fisher King), gunslinger (Wild Bill), businessman (Iron Man) -- has proven him to be an invaluable asset for any movie, one that keeps getting better with age. And his latest role, while reminiscent of past performances, demonstrates how he can immerse himself in a character, especially one that's incredibly unflattering.\n\nThis film is based on a book, which is based on fact ... or some facts. As the opening slate puts it, \"More of this is true than you'd like to believe.\" However, this fictionalized version of those facts really feels like something that came entirely out of the minds of the Coen brothers, and not just because some famous faces from their work (George Clooney, Jeff Bridges) star in this film... though that certainly doesn't help matters at all. But that's not to say that bearing a strong resemblance to a Coens movie is a bad thing -- it's a perfectly fine thing to aspire to. And when it is done well here, it's really funny... but when it isn't, it's pretty dull and boring. Luckily, there's more of the former than the latter, and this ends up being a solid, if not stellar, film.\n\nThe greatest Marvel superhero movie ever made -- you heard me, Spider-Man -- is coming to DVD. On September 30, you'll be able to get your hands on three different versions of the Iron Man DVD, and like the three different armors he wears in the film, each has bigger and better features than the last. Let's call them Mark 1, 2 and 3. You know, because we're all big nerds. (Well, I am.)"}

Survivorman is full of handy tips, heh.\n\nToast took me to Mexitaco for some semi-authentic Mexican cuisine (I believe it was Maria who said, \"if you're not eating it in Mexico, then it's not authentic\", she's probably right).

It's a spiraling film, intricately weaving its initially disparate storylines into a tight crosshatch. It asks the question, what is an acceptable trade off? What's the ratio of ruined lives to save lives that makes it worthwhile? Anger and fear prevail while compassion and understanding have entirely no place. A sobering and fantastic film."}
{"text":"This item is unavailable.\n\nWith cool precision and stunning intimacy, ROMANCE paints a provocative portrait of a young French woman, Marie (Caroline Ducey) and her journey to gain control of her life. Claiming he loves her, but that he has lost his desire for her, Marie's boyfriend, Paul (Sagamore Stevenin) refuses to engage in sexual relations, catapulting Marie into a desperate search for intimacy and erotic connection. Marie's escalating sexual journey tests her own physical and emotional limits, and, through an ironic twist-of-fate, eventually leads her to fulfilment.\n\nProbably one of the most provocative films I've ever seen. It isn't porno, it's making a statement about how men 'use' women in the male-dominated world, and how vulnerable women can be. Only the French seem to be able to deal with this sort of theme in a deeply sensuous, un-tacky way."}

Unlike that string bean Angelina Jolie; Gina does all her own stunts. She's a Mixed Martial Arts champion, from Dallas County, Texas. Her demeanour is soldierly, through and through. In Haywire, her mission is to beat the crap out of male movie stars. She does so with aplomb. As the tagline says, \"They left her no choice.\" This girl was born to get into fights.\n\nStarting over isn't easy. Most of us live with wreckage in our heads. The calamities of the past don't just get up and walk away; they hang around, like unwanted tenants, drumming on your skull. That's why people who say \"it's never too late\" should be strangled with rainbows. Any trite response should be met with force. As adults, we need to reconcile ourselves with mountains. That takes some doing. Only incipient people can change without stress. For those who've lived, change can feel like you're unravelling. Mike Mills' new movie, Beginners, is about adults stumbling into a new phase of their lives. They stumble because they're not ignorant of history. Their new lives are always mindful of the past.\n\nWhat goes through a movie star's head when they're acting in a really generic movie? Are they hoping: maybe it's not as bad as I think? Or do they know, even as they schlep through yet another tired and derivative scene, that the scene is tired, and derivative, and that some things you just do for money\u2026 for a new boat. Deception (the new erotic thriller starring Ewan McGregor and Hugh Jackman) is so formulaic it needn't even have been made.

{"text":"Many people avoid short films because they think they are inferior to full-length features. \"Goodnight Bill\" is the type of short film that would turn one of those naysayers into a believer. It is funny, touching and on par with any two hour epic.\n\nThe story follows two old men, Bill (Michael Marcus) and Terry (Michael Higgins), stuck in a hospital room together. Bill is cantankerous and doesn't like roommates, but would be able to tolerate Terry if the man wasn't gay. The fact that he likes men so rankles Bill that he won't even get out of bed to urinate for fear of Terry getting a glimpse of his ass through his hospital gown. Terry takes Bill's homophobia in stride, though. You can tell he's lived through worse (like a World War) and doesn't care too much about what the world thinks about him. His homosexuality isn't his entire being, either, and it's those other aspects of his life that form a bridge between him and his roommate.\n\nThis movie, which is just under twenty minutes in length, is a brilliant showcase of what short films are capable of achieving in the right hands. There is a sublime beauty to brevity, and nowhere is this more apparent than with this"}

{"text":"Precious\n\nPrecious was never going to be a light-hearted trip to the cinema. Harrowing to the point of being labeled \"poverty porn,\" it is the story of Claireece \"Precious\" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe), a morbidly obese, illiterate African American teenager, who is raped by her father, beaten by her mother and pregnant with her second child of incest. Based on the novel Push, by Sapphire, it's worth noting that Precious is an amalgam, a combination and terrifying representation of Sapphire's experiences as a teacher in Harlem. This no doubt explains the sympathetic, borderline angelic characterisation of Precious' teacher, Ms. Rain (Paula Patton), whose dedication and tenacity resembles a slightly more realistic version of Michelle Pfeiffer circa Dangerous Minds.\n\nSo why subject yourself to 109 minutes of horrible abuse? Surely rumours of Mariah Carey's make up free face and Glitter-salvaging performance won't quite do the trick. It's honestly a tough call, other than to say Sidibe fearlessly embodies a member of society that deserves recognition. Illiteracy, obesity and abuse are tragic and uncomfortable realities that Precious goes a long way to demystify. Mo'Nique cleaning up the awards season for her brutal performance as Precious' fatally flawed mother shines the spotlight brighter still on the vicious, generational cycle of violence.\n\nBut lest this review descend into a public service announcement, suffice it to say that as much as director Lee Daniels doesn't shy away from the horrifying reality, nor does he forget the rich, soothing and supporting realm of fantasy. Every time Precious is pushed down (hence the original title), she escapes into a utopian dreamscape of wealth, fame and love. The journey of this film is the intersection of these two worlds, where Precious equips herself with the skills to carve out her own life, somewhere in the middle."}
{"text":"I typically try and stay away from political thrillers bit too much, usually because of the heavy handed tactics and message that is more or less bludgeoning you over the head at every scene. I can understand the meaning behind it, I just don't need to sit through a political debate for two hours when I want to watch an engaging movie. There are some films that inherently use the political or social agenda to their advantage to make a statement, but too often films fall into this habit. If a director can find a topic of interest and craft a film around a particular agenda or idea, I can appreciate the skill involved in it. It becomes educational and entertaining while not diminishing the effective message or feel that they want to convey.

{"text":"\"Outrage Beyond\" is the most violent and brutal of Kitano's body of work yet, and considering the writer-director-star is known for his shocking, graphic Yakuza dramas, that's something worth noting. As back-to-basics as \"Outrage\" seemed, coming after a string of quieter, more experimental fare from the filmmaker that never even reached American shores, \"Outrage Beyond\" takes the standard gangster movie template and blasts it out of the water. Yet, for all it's violence, \"Outrage Beyond\" is unmistakably a work of the master himself, feeling like a more contemporary chapter of the book Kitano's been writing for a long time, in a similar manner as Martin Scorsese tackling \"The Departed.\"\n\nThere's not a single moment of Dong-Hoo Choi's \"The Thieves\" that stays still. Endlessly busy despite a robust 136 minute runtime, Korea's highest grossing film in history should be more than familiar to western audiences. It's a heist picture, one with a wide ensemble of moving parts which compliment each other as each heist is carried out with point men, lookouts, and movie-world gizmos, and like even the thinnest of these pictures, \"The Thieves\" is less interested in the characters than it is the elaborate stunts and gimmicks."}

But does an ungrateful, greedy world deserve their efforts? Given a choice between heroism and happiness, between saving the world and saving one's beloved, will self-interest always win out?\n\nAmid a welter of eye-popping creature-feature smackdowns and stunning visions of grotesquerie, Hellboy II finds time to toy with questions like these. If Hellboy II is a Middle Movie, as it seems to be, answers may or may not be forthcoming in Hellboy III.\n\nRon Perlman as Hellboy, Selma Blair as Liz\n\nIronically, it's Christmas Eve as Hellboy II opens in a prologue set in 1955, when Hellboy was but a little Hell-BOY (as opposed to the current fully-grown Hell-MAN) living with his adopted father Prof. Bruttenholm (John Hurt) at an army base. The season is a reminder that salvation has already come to mankind\u2014though Hellboy, like many kids at Christmas, isn't thinking about the Savior, but about that other fellow who comes at that time of year. And when he asks Bruttenholm to tell him a story before bed, the professor cracks open a big old book and reads a mythic tale of primeval paradise lost\u2014but it doesn't bear much resemblance to the early chapters of Genesis.\n\nIn the beginning, the tale goes, men, elves and other supernatural creatures coexisted peacefully on earth. But man was \"created with a hole in his heart,\" and in his \"infinite greed\" sought to overrun the earth. This led to war between men and faeryfolk, and to the creation of the unstoppable Golden Army\u2014a force so terrible that the wise Woodland King decided it must never be used, and struck a treaty with man to share the earth, with cities for men and forests for creatures of faery.\n\nMeanwhile, untold millennia later in the real world, it turns out that creatures of magic have gotten the short end of the stick, having kept their end of the treaty while humans blithely did as they pleased. The aged Woodland King accepts this with passive resignation, reasoning that it is their nature to keep the treaty just as it is man's nature to break it.\n\nHowever, exiled Prince Nuada (Luke Goss, One Night With the King) isn't content to fade away while man bulldozes forests to build shopping malls. Nuada wants total war, Golden Army\u2013style\u2014and he's willing to kill his own kind to get things started. The main hitch: His twin sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton, Vampire Diary) flees with of the three pieces of the magical crown needed to control the Golden Army.\n\nDoug Jones as Abe\n\nThat's the setup to an ever-escalating battery of showdowns including a bloody coup in faeryland, attacks by swarms of disturbingly feral fairies, a melee in an underground troll market, a sprawling combat with an enormous vegetative forest god in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, and of course a climactic confrontation with Nuada and the Golden Army."}
{"text":"I'm not sure it makes a whole ton of sense that I like Baz Luhrmann's movies as much as I do. I tend to prefer movies that are quiet and slow, contemplative, that allow themselves (and me) to breathe. I think we know Luhrmann doesn't do any of those things.\n\nBut I think he does two things really well, and they must be what attracts me\u2013 first, I'm rarely bored. What he's doing really doesn't always work, but it's interesting to me to watch him try, and his strange kind of mania holds my attention. I often feel like his world is a world that's about a half step to the side of the one we actually live in. It's clearly not our reality, but it's not different enough to be unfamiliar, either.\n\nThe other thing he does really well\u2013 and I really feel like this is what does it for me\u2013 is sincerity. He REALLY MEANS IT. And when so many parts of pop culture are winking at you, or are full of subtext, or are trying so darn hard to be ironic, it's such a welcome shift to see someone being so sincere in what he's doing.\n\nNow, that sincerity can sometimes cause problems. His dialogue is occasionally clunky, or even a little silly. We sometimes end up with devices like dreadful voiceovers. And in pretty much all of his movies (I haven't seen Australia), it takes about a half hour to settle in to his world, because it's just not something we're used to. But I'm fine with all of that\u2013 I'm willing to take that deal if it means I get Luhrmann's enthusiasm and mania and, yeah, sincerity along with it.\n\nI know it's not for everybody. I get why people think this movie is a mess, or just doesn't work for them. It does for me, though. And I also think that Luhrmann's quirks actually make some of the kookier parts of the story (the \"all-seeing eyes,\" for one) work a lot better than they might if they were put on by a more grounded director. Luhrmann's sense of reality (which is different from anyone else's) make those pieces fit.\n\nI don't think this is quite to the level of something like Moulin Rouge, and I think part of the problem, for me, is that I don't care nearly as much about the characters. I don't feel like the story is terribly interesting. I do think the examination of social economic class is interesting. Just not really the characters who are put into it.\n\nLeo is fantastic. He covers a lot of ground, from being completely confident to being terribly nervous, plus broody, aggravating, needy, generous, obsessive, and kind of insane. I loved him trying out different ways of buttoning his jacket while waiting to meet Daisy again for the first time in years. I loved how he said \"Old Sport\" in a way that didn't feel very organic, which makes sense since he took it on as an affectation instead of it being something he naturally acquired.\n\nOne thing that bothered me a fair bit is how the movie treats black people. Meaning, it's pretty clear it doesn't know how to treat them. Luhrmann just sprinkles some black people here and there, here are some musicians, there are some driving alongside our heroes in a car, for no apparent reason except so that we can see them there. Our villain makes a couple of racist comments, but otherwise \"race\" is never really treated. Would anyone have blinked if one of the main characters had been black? I'm willing to bet not. As much as I loved Leo, what if we had had a black Gatsby? It would have worked, and might have made a lot of sense with the rest of the movie. I just don't understand why Luhrmann had to make it feel so much like, \"oh, let's put some black people here and here, that'll do,\" like it was just part of the art direction.\n\nSpeaking of art direction, sort of. Amy noticed that, while most of the women in the movie are wearing bright, bold colors, there are a couple of scenes where Daisy and the golfer (Jordan?) are wearing much softer, cream-colored clothes. I can't imagine that Baz Luhrmann, of all people, doesn't have very specific reasons for why people are wearing the clothes they're wearing in particular scenes. I'm certainly not the person to take the time to analyze all the costume changes and what they might mean, but I'd be interested to see the work of someone who did. I'm curious to know who's wearing what and when they're wearing it, and what that might mean.\n\nI thought the music worked. Of course, I thought the music worked for Moulin Rouge, too, and if you don't agree with me on that then you really don't agree with me on that.\n\nNOTE: I hardly remember the book at all, and I don't really care how this movie compares to it. I felt liberated not to have to spend my time thinking about the book while watching the movie, like apparently everyone else in the world felt they had to do.\n\nAdditional NOTE: If you see some stupid ad or video at the end of this or any post on this site, we have nothing to do with it. WordPress has apparently started adding those on accounts that aren't paying for their \"no ad\" upgrade. We are getting no money from them, and it might be time to find a new home.\n\n1) This still plays pretty well, but you can tell it's 20 years old. There are just some style differences that you'd see if this movie were made today. So much swelling orchestral music (throughout) that feels dated. Some of the action stuff would be way slicker. Don't know if that's a good or a bad thing.\n\n2) The couple of pieces that everyone remembers\u2013 Ford jumping off the train, Ford jumping off the dam\u2013 really all happen in the first half hour or so. The real meat of the movie is also why it's so good: it turns into mystery while being a chase movie. The best stuff is Ford investigating the one-armed man, and his near-misses (or \"near-hits\" if you're George Carlin) with Tommy Lee Jones along the way. It's pretty nicely put together.\n\n3) It's really weird watching Tommy Lee Jones here. He looks like a CGI version of his current (old) self made to look 20 years younger. I guess he was just born to be old. I liked him a lot here, he's definitely fun, but you're not going to convince me he should have won the Oscar over Ralph Fiennes (and maybe Pete Postlethwaite, but it's been a long time since I've seen In the Name of the Father).\n\n4) I don't really understand why Jeroen Krabbe doesn't just help the police catch Kimble. It's not like Kimble was going to find out, and it's pretty reasonable for Krabbe just to say, \"man, the guy is my friend, but this is the law we're talking about,\" and just slip the cops some info, let them catch Kimble, and be on his way, never to be discovered as the big bad guy. Instead, he's all, \"Kimble is innocent and smarter than everyone, you'll never catch him, ha ha ha,\" and then, sure enough, all that is true and Kimble kicks his ass because he's actually the bad guy. Why? We sort of decided that he must have just been so arrogant that he thought he could behave that way and never get found out, but he sure could have saved himself a lot of trouble. I mean, that's really, really stupid.\n\n5) I want to see the movie where the middle-aged doctors have a climactic fight where they look like middle-aged doctors. Like, basically they're really bad at fighting, and one guy lands a good punch and it really hurts (both of them, cause the puncher probably breaks his hand) and it just looks kind of terrible and doesn't last very long. Did not like the action-movie punch out at the end here.\n\n6) Really, the movie's probably about 10 \u2013 15 minutes too long.\n\nUpdate: Oh, also, I like the visual \"quotes\" the movie takes from other movies. I saw a couple from Indiana Jones movies, and another from The Conversation. I'm sure there are some that I missed. Kinda fun.\n\nI wonder if I'll ever write a post about this entire series. It won't be today, but I keep feeling like I will.\n\nIt seems like the people spend more time in this movie talking about the impact of the series on their lives than they have in previous installments, but it's possible I'm not remembering correctly. It just has a much greater \"meta\" feel than I recall. Is this Apted kind of recognizing that he might not be around for 63 Up?\n\nAppropriately, Nick is the one who takes things to the real meta-level and makes the point that, while all of the subjects spend this time talking about how the movies haven't really captured their true lives, the movies aren't actually even about their lives, they're about everyone's lives.\n\nI say \"appropriately\" Nick says this, because in the narrative that Apted has created, Nick is the \"thinker.\" I have absolutely no doubt that other people in this series have said exactly what Nick said, but Apted chose Nick to say it in the movie because it fits his \"character\" best. And I'm fine with that. I'm willing to play along.\n\nI'm willing to play along with all of it. I've said more times than I can count that I think this series is the greatest achievement in movie history. I love it. I love it so much. I got a little teary-eyed when some of the people would show up on screen. It's life, you know? What a thing.\n\nI want to go through each person, but I'm not going to. Maybe some day. I think Apted knew exactly what he was doing by saving Tony for last. Amy and I were very, very curious to see how he was doing after he had been buying real estate in Spain directly before the global financial crash, so we were pretty worried about him. Turns out, he's fine. Thank goodness. How did he end up being fine? That part, I'm not so sure about. But he's Tony, and he's resourceful, and he figured it out.\n\nThe original movie wanted to outline how the class system structured the lives of the kids, and how it would for the rest of their lives. I think if you watch that first one and then 56 Up, there is no question that class had a LOT to do with where people ended up. Some of the people in the movie don't agree with me. Some of them do. Could it have something to do with how Apted wove the narrative? Yeah, but only to a degree. A lot of it is very real.\n\nBut mostly, life. I remember Roger Ebert, and probably plenty of other people, saying that the really difficult thing to imagine about dying is how you don't get to see all of the stuff that happens the next day. Life is pretty amazing.\n\nI liked this a fair bit, although I'm really wondering if I felt that way just because of how much better than Men In Black II was.\n\nProbably not, I think it was generally pretty good. The two things I liked the most:\n\n1) Josh Brolin killed it.\n\n2) The whole infinite possibility\/alternate universe thing. I love that. That's a fascinating idea, and they took it and made it a lot of fun.\n\nSomething I think is interesting is watching that guy who played the alien who can see the alternate realities. His name is Michael Stuhlbarg, and he often plays characters with some kind of major weakness, but he also plays Arnold Rothstein on HBO's \"Boardwalk Empire,\" a character who has very little weakness. Watch that and then watch him in Lincoln and then go watch him in A Serious Man. He's good, and versatile.\n\nI thought the ending was silly, but whatever. Mostly this was fun and I didn't expect much else. And so much better than #2.\n\nI get very excited when I see\/hear\/read stories like this because they're just so amazing and so absorbing and it makes me think that if this story exists in the world, I can't wait to find out what else there is. (I felt the same way when I discovered George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" [Game of Thrones] a year ago, which I realize is fiction while Searching For Sugar Man is not, which means either I don't distinguish or it doesn't matter and a good story is a good story.) It's just hard to believe that this happened and I'm just now hearing about it. That's so damned exciting.\n\nAlso, it's just such a good story. Can you imagine? And the structure of the movie is just set so well, especially if you have absolutely no idea what it's about. Amy literally said, \"what the hell?\" when it was revealed that Rodriguez is still alive, and didn't set himself on fire or shoot himself on stage or whatever (I'm not sure by that point she believed he'd done those things, because it was obviously a little fishy that there were so many different stories about how he'd died, but I think it's reasonable to have assumed that he died from drugs or hard living or just something). And then arenas full of people? Just\u2026 man.\n\nAmy said I needed to find out which country secretly thinks the Skaguanas are the greatest band of the 20th century.\n\nI can't even begin to understand this guy, though. I'd like to. I'm not obsessed with material things by any means, but I mean holy crap. So not only do we have just an exceptionally thrilling story (and it is), but the guy at the center of it lives some kind of transcendent life.\n\nI used this Mark Twain quote one other time, when I talked about Marwencol:\n\n\"Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities. Truth isn't.\""}
{"text":"Parents say\n\nKids say\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nParents need to know that this play-based period comedy might not seem to be standard fare for teens at first glance, but its two leads -- Jessica Biel of 7th Heaven and Prince Caspian's Ben Barnes -- may be a draw. The film tackles some mature themes, mainly regarding marriage and in-law relationships, and has a little swearing. Not surprisingly for a period film, the characters do smoke a lot -- nearly incessantly, actually. There's also drinking and some (though not much) partial nudity.\n\nA young woman means well, as does her new husband, but somehow they fail to support each other. A mother-in-law is very judgmental and doesn't seem to be aware of how terrible she can be. A father (who suffers from post-WWI depression\/malaise) seems unconcerned about his son's fate. A young woman and her mother-in-law clash and, after some attempts to get along, dig in their heels for a long fight.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nBased on a play by Noel Coward, EASY VIRTUE finds out what happens when a prodigal young Englishman, John Whittaker (Ben Barnes), brings home his new wife, Larita (Jessica Biel) -- a racy American race-car driver and divorc\u00e9e -- to his family's rambling country estate. His mother, Veronica (Kristin Scott Thomas), finds Larita's unfamiliar ways ghastly; his sisters are both fascinated and jealous. Only the butler (Kris Marshall) and John's father, the forlorn Mr. Whittaker (Colin Firth), seem to like her. But Larita won't go without a heck of a fight.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nEASY VIRTUE is a sight to behold. Kudos to the art director, set designer, and costumers for creating a shabbily sophisticated world that's long gone but not forgotten. The images are as crisp as Scott Thomas' upper-crust diction, and the set design is divine. (You can almost feel the dust flying off of those wonderful furniture pieces that have been neglected as the money well runs dry.) Delightful in parts and intolerable in others, the film does, however, suffer from two challenges.\n\nFirst, there's Biel's somewhat limited range. She gives the enterprise a spirited try and sometimes succeeds, especially when Larita's poignancy shines through. But she's not as funny as she needs to be in such a tart-tongued role. Coming in second is a storyline that, even for a period comedy, is played so much for its quaintness that it becomes unrelatable. And there's so much attention paid to the repetitive back-and-forth between Larita and Veronica that it wears the audience down. When the big \"bombshell\" is finally revealed, it feels bereft of tension or importance marriage and relationships. Are any of the relationships the kind you'd want to have? Do you think the characters take their marriages seriously? Families can also discuss the dynamics of introducing someone new to the fold. Why did John's mother and Larita take an instant dislike to each other? Why does John tolerate or even seemingly enjoy it? What about John's sisters? Were their actions understandable or unforgivable"}
{"text":"The New Daughter\n\n\n\nThe movie appears grossly under budget, but it still doesn't take away from the over all effect of the film. The movie really gets under your skin with the atmosphere it delivers: A single father, with two children moving away from urban society to bond closer to his offspring, but struggling to deal with a teenage daughter trying to find her place in life.\n\nCostner provides an extremely rich performance, you will buy him being a caring father who is at wits end dealing with his troubled teen. Ivana Baquerio nails it as a moody teen who starts taking on new personality traits after the discovery of an odd mound on the family's new property.\n\nAs the film progresses you see a loving father tossed into the mouth of madness as his daughter grows increasingly strange and violent. I would say even though this film is straight out of 2009, it is arguably Costner's greatest film (purely my opinion)"}
{"text":"Jack Kerouac's \"On the Road\" is so thoroughly based on the beauty of language that it will be interesting to see what kind of movie it will make. It's the kind of dream project that elicits nightmares because it's incredibly popular, but it's also that rare case where a book is fiercely personal no matter how many millions of people read it. Walter Salles took on the challenge, and his background in road movies certainly helps, but there are some x-factors here to be sure.\n\nSam Riley sounds appropriately gruff and wandering in voice over in the new trailer, but the movie will also be a test of whether Garrett Hedlund and Kristen Stewart can really act or if they can only chew gum and walk.\n\nCheck it out for yourself:\n\nWhat's striking here is that the look of the project isn't aggressively indicative of the period. The cars are there and some of the styles, but there's something that just doesn't seem antique about it, and maybe that's the point.\n\nFortunately, it still looks feverish and sweaty, and with any luck, it'll be a maddeningly unstructured and untethered as the book itself"}
{"text":"In Bruges\n\nIn Bruges is one of those films where you're not really sure if you want to recommend it to someone. My mom, her friend and I (and most of the theater) really enjoyed it. But we were at the Palm, and in San Luis Obispo, when you say it's a Palm movie, people instantly know what you're talking about. Not necessarily mainstream, a little off, and sometimes weird.\n\nIn short, In Bruges is about two hit men holed up in Bruges, Belgium, after a job went bad. Ken is excited at the chance to play tourist\u2026he thinks Bruges, in all it's medieval glory, is wonderful. Ray isn't so happy. Early in the movie he tells Ken, \"If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't.\" When their boss, Harry, calls Ken and gives him an order things begin to get complicated. And the language gets even worse.\n\nColin Farrell is great as Ray, especially when he acts like a petulant little kid. In one scene Ken is playing tourist and trying to explain the significance of a church. Ray pouts on a pew, and makes noise by rattling chairs around. When Ken glares at him and tells him to stop, he slinks up to Ken, dragging his feet just like a little kid would.\n\nHere's another quote from Ray: \"Because, really hoped I wouldn't die. I really, really hoped I wouldn't die.\" Ray's hatred of Bruges is a recurring theme in the movie, and it's actually funny how much he loathes the town. Especially because they do a great job of showing Bruges' beauty. If you're a traveler, it'll make you want to plan to visit one day.\n\nThe movie has lots of blood, and lots of creative (and not so creative) swearing and politically incorrect language. Which probably says something about my maturity level. But in my defense, my mom liked it, too! So while I really enjoyed the movie, I have some reservations in telling anyone to go see it.

Conlon insisted that he was innocent and that his confession had been extorted through physical and psychological brutality. Sheridan buys Conlon's story uncritically. Every Englishman here is a corrupt anti-Irish bigot, except Emma Thompson, who plays a sympathetic lawyer who pleads Conlon's appeal and gels the case retried.\n\nThe film's most striking subplot has Postlethwaite, as Day-Lewis's distant working-class father, arrested when he tries to free his son. In the unlikeliest of coincidences\u2014though a real one\u2014father and son end up in the same British prison cell. As the two become enmeshed in the turmoil of prison life, Sheridan stages the anguished father-son confrontations with intimacy, and Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite play the relationship with moving passion.\n\nIf Sheridan didn't feel the need to pile on the pedantic subtexts, this would be an absorbing personal drama, rather than a vituperative, question-begging broadside.

{"text":"Written by\nAnonymous\n\nUser Reviews\n\nOther reviews have given the details, so I'll stick to overall impressions. This movie moves a little slowly, and there are no belly laughs or sophomoric humor. It also poses some questions without answering them, which enrages some people (you know who you are, so avoid this movie if you like everything to be tied in a little bow). I tend to like movies that leave you thinking, so this was refreshing for me. The movie is intelligent, and sweet and comforting like a mug of hot chocolate on a cold day. The acting was quite good, everyone was very believable in their roles and no one was over the top.

It's mostly a testament of how gay men are treated in China and told through flashbacks, as the officer interrogates the suspect. It's suppose to be edgy, but I didn't like the format or the police abuse. My co-worker Brian Moylan, however, loved it. He rates it a 5. He liked the tension and the story.

{"text":"Your lead actors Will Ash and Christine Bottomley are new names so what are the risks of an unknown cast and how was the casting process?\n\nWell Will I have seen in a couple of things and I have always liked him because he is an honest actor and I like that he's a good man and one of the best people that I have met in a long time. He's a really good guy and he did so much for me that I will always be indebted to him.\n\nAnd the same thing with Christine, Christine is a very different sort of actor she's brilliant and very instinctual and really there when you watch it just watch her eyes welling up.\n\nAnd I think if you have good actors then you have a good film it's that simple you can have bad cinematography and bad lighting but good actors.\n\nAnd what was the shoot itself like, on the M1 and at night, it must have thrown up a few issues?\n\nYeah yeah yeah it threw up a lot, and ones that I didn't realise, but mainly shooting at night because people get fatigued and that is a huge problem, the rest of it you can take in your stride, but that was pretty much it the tiredness I had no idea, I hope I never have to do that again.\n\nYou have already touched on this but what or who influences your filmmaking?\n\nIf I'm honest with you when you ask these sorts of question people throw them out and a lot of the time it's The Usual Suspects, Spielberg, De Palma, Coppola, and you say it and they are all the same as everyone else has said and admired.\n\nI like people like Chris Nolan and David Lynch but I also like the new breed of directors that are coming though like Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, they did Little Miss Sunshine, I think they are something pretty special and some of the Spanish stuff that's coming through like Guillermo Del Toro, Pans Labyrinth was one of the best films that I had seen in ages.\n\nBut I also look at movies from a director producer perspective you know? I can't think of Zack Snyder without his wife, whose name escapes me, or James Mangold without Cathy Konrad or Peter Jackson without Fran Walsh because that's how I work, I work with my wife. And I look at those relationship and you have got to have something pretty special going on there.\n\nAnd that's what I've noticed that a lot of directors, and there are more than the ones I've just mentioned, and James Mangold and Peter Jackson are arguably amongst the top twenty directors on the planet and they all work with their wives, which is what I do.\n\nAnd there's nothing like working with your family and if you can withstand the pressure it's pretty amazing.\n\nThe British film industry is very much in the spotlight with the success of Slumdog Millionaire but in reality how difficult is it an industry to work in?\n\nOh it's probably the hardest in the world because if you look at the French they aren't competing with any other French speaking companies but we are competing with the Americans, they are our direct competition.\n\nBut making films isn't the hard part, I mean it is hard, but the real difficulty is getting the distribution you could make the best film in the world but if no one sees it then it doesn't matter.\n\nThe audience, I believe, don't choose what they want to go and see they are told what to see and they are told by marketing budgets so we are all being told to go and see Watchmen, we probably will go to see Watchmen and it will probably be very good, but my point is when you deal with a juggernaut like that and you are talking about a film like ours that's made on a fraction of the cost and you are going up against it it's very very very hard.\n\nIt's very difficult when you are starting out and if I was starting out now I would be very worried because there is so little money around and it's very hard to get distribution and I would seriously consider finding other ways like putting a film straight onto the Internet.\n\nI don't know what the way forward would be but I got in just before that new wave of filmmaking starts to happen and I think it will happen and people will begin to distribute there own stuff, sort of what has happened with music.\n\nFinally what is next for you, I read that you had your next five projects all planned out?\n\nYeah I'm doing something called the Fourth Prophet which I'm really excited about and we are hoping to shoot in the summer but I have to get the script right, which in front of me as we speak.\n\nHush is released 13th March\n\nFemaleFirst Helen Earnshaw"}
{"text":"worked is because, by solving the mystery at the midway point, Hitchcock made us realize that the mystery was not what the film was really about. It was mischievous and a bit maddening, but it worked.\n\nThe same cannot be said for \"Snake Eyes.\" The director, Brian De Palma (who is one of the few contemporary directors to consciously walk in Hitch's footsteps), attempts something similar, but to disastrous results. It's not that the whole movie is bad--in fact, parts of it are excellent, especially in a visual sense. However, De Palma makes the mistake of revealing the mastermind behind an assassination conspiracy before the movie is half over, thus leaving himself with nothing to work with. He attempts to tack on a sort of bitter, ironic twist ending, but by that point he has lost what was left of the audience.\n\nThe movie stars Nicolas Cage as Rick Santoro, a garish, loud-mouthed, bribe-taking Atlantic City homicide detective who gets caught in a tangled web when the Secretary of Defense, who is seated behind him at a huge, pay-per-view heavyweight prize fight, is assassinated. At first, it looks like the blame will fall on Santoro's best friend, Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), a Navy officer who is in charge of security when the assassination takes place. Santoro, driven equally by his desire to boost his career and his desire to protect his friend's credibility, goes on an intense hunt to find out what really happened. At his disposal are 1,500 cameras in the boxing arena and the adjoining casino, and 14,000 eyewitnesses.\n\nSome of the movie's best scenes involve Santoro piecing together what happened using the video surveillance cameras. In these moments, \"Snake Eyes\" evokes films like \"Blowup\" (1966), \"The Conversation\" (1974), and De Palma's own, infinitely superior \"Blow Out\" (1981). Sometimes, a different camera angle can make all the difference, as when Santoro sees an eagle-eye view of the fight, and realizes that the heavyweight champion, a 10-to-1 bet for victory, went down on a phantom punch seconds before the assassination.\n\nThere are other people possibly involved, including a luscious red-head who seems to lure Dunne away from his post, and a young woman named Julia (Carla Gugino), who is talking to the Secretary when he gets shot. The movie is filled with red herrings and false leads, but amazingly enough, once De Palma unmasks the person behind the assassination, everything suddenly seems uncomfortably simple. Instead of the \"Rashomon\"-style multiple viewpoints enhancing the complexity of the plot, they are revealed to be nothing more than window dressing. In fact, without the multiple viewpoints, back-tracking, and flashbacks, \"Snake Eyes\" would be downright simplistic.\n\nThe movie has numerous other problems, as well. There are several logic gaps, including the one where Julia, in a stark white dress spattered all over with the Secretary's blood, is not noticed by anyone or detained by the police. I can imagine her slipping by in the crowd of 14,000 panicked people, but at one point she actively tries to push her way past a security guard who still fails to notice her gory appearance.\n\nAnd then there's that ending, with Cage beaten up and mumbling in a way that makes him resemble Quasimodo from \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" facing the killer in the middle of a hurricane that has no narrative purpose whatsoever. Did De Palma and his co-scenarist David Koepp (\"Jurassic Park,\" \"Carlito's Way\") decide that the story had lost so much momentum by that point that they had to include a major weather disaster to heighten the intensity?\n\nIf there's anything to cheer in \"Snake Eyes\" it's the camerawork of cinematographer Stephen H. Burum, who has worked consistently with De Palma since 1984's \"Body Double.\" De Palma and Burum put together several stunning setpieces, including an unbroken opening shot that is sustained for at least ten minutes, and a fine use of split-screen to show how the same even is being perceived from two points of view. However, because the story is so weak and ultimately self-destructive, all that powerful camerawork ends up looking more like a cheap means to distract the audience away from the story's flaws, instead of being an integral part of the narrative process."}

I had seen him in 21 Jumpstreet but only really remembered him as a pretty face. This movie showed me that he could really act. His portrayal of Gilbert Grape is so heart-felt and moving.\n\nPlaying Gilbert's mentally impaired younger brother Arnie, is Leonardo DiCaprio. He did an outstanding job. I can see why he was nominated for an Oscar for this role. His body language, mannerisms and way of speaking are all perfect for the role he is playing.\n\nDue to Gilbert's mother being housebound (she hasn't left the house in over 7 years) and his father being dead, it falls on Gilbert to be the main caretaker of Arnie. On top of that he has to work to help support the family. Arnie and Gilbert are together almost constantly. Gilbert is very patient with Arnie and very protective of him. Johnny and Leonardo's interactions with each other are just amazing. You feel like they are a real family.\n\nI really feel for Gilbert. His whole life revolves around taking care of other people and putting their interests first. He doesn't have a life of his own. Although, he loves his family you can tell he feels trapped, with no way out of his situation. When Becky (Juliette Lewis) arrives in town, Gilbert starts to learn that there can be more to his life.\n\nMemorable Moments (without giving too much away):\n\nGilbert giving Arnie piggyback rides, even though he is almost as big as he is.\n\nGilbert talking Arnie down from the water tower with a silly saying that Arnie likes (using a bullhorn, in front of a whole crowd of people). Totally made me fall in love with Gilbert.\n\nGilbert's friend, Tucker, going on and on about the new Burger Barn that is coming to town (obviously a small town in the middle of nowhere if that is the hot topic of conversation).\n\nBecky asking Gilbert what he wants in life and he only names things he wants for other people.\n\nJan\n\nFollowing is additional information about the movie that contains spoilers. If you don't want to be spoiled don't read any further.\n\nI get so frustrated with Gilbert's family. They really don't appreciate all he does for them and how he has basically given up his own life to take care of Arnie. I really want to sit them down and set them straight.\n\nGilbert finding Arnie still in the bathtub the next morning was so sad. It was like he was being punished for putting himself first for once.\n\nI was so shocked when Gilbert snapped and hit Arnie. Although, I can understand why it happened; I so didn't see it coming.\n\nLoved Mama calling Gilbert her \"Knight in Shimmering Armor\". It was the first sign that she really knows all he does.\n\nBurning down the house was so symbolic. Like a phoenix rising out of the ashes to start a new life."}

The idea for Enter the Void was heavily influenced by The Tibetan Book of the Dead (which is referenced in the film), and in the book afterlife is described as being a journey for the soul where it freely travels through time and the world watching life go on as it searches for reincarnation. Oscar,a young drug dealer, is killed when\u2026\n\nI'm not going to pull any punches here: this is a self-indulgent bucket of shit that doesn't deserve your time. Here's how it breaks down:\n\nMinutes 0-2: The best opening credits I've ever seen. Minutes 2-30: \"Ooh, look, I can do long takes! And shaky cam! How innovative!\" Minutes 30-45: \"Floating around Tokyo...ooh look! Strippers! Sex! Nudity! That's some groundbreaking shit right there!\" Minutes 45-50: \"Looking back on my childhood...I still couldn't act for shit. But if that isn't sentimental,\u2026\n\nGaspar Noe's neon lit crazy dreamlike ghost story is a complete visual masterpiece. The first 30 minutes, shot completely in first person, are captivating and is a great way to introduce the world of a slightly futuristic Tokyo, covered in flashing lights and skyscrapers. The film then moves into the bulk of it's narrative, full of spinning, sweeping shots and floating from place to place. It is some truly incredible camerawork, and combined with the level of detail that has\u2026\n\nEnter the void and feel your life dipped into a violent world of neon and love. Gaspar No\u00e9's work is hard to describe so I don't even try. He lives on his own planet of film making and you can feel his passion, love and vision in every frame of his work. Original as it gets.\n\nI've been looking forward to watching Enter the Void for quite some time, and so my rating partly reflects the fact that it left me feeling both empty and disappointed. Considering that it's something akin to the cinematic equivalent of Sigmund Freud on\u2026"}

{"text":"Lost Highway\n\nSynopsis\n\nDirector David Lynch gives us a psycho thriller beyond definition that has audiences tangled in the provocations of nightmares, violence, sex sequences, reality, the subconscious, and madness as they must create their own interpretations of the film.\n\nIt seems that there are at least two ways to enjoy a David Lynch film. One is to expect it to make sense and do everything you can to analyze the shit out of it until it does. The other is to just revel in the weirdness and the creativity and not worry about making all the pieces fit together.\n\nOn my first watch of Lost Highway, I can't possibly put into words what the fuck happened. I feel like there are things I implicitly understood about the narrative and the connection between the two halves of the film, but what I took away from it was a wordless feeling of unease and anxiety. I don't want to think about\u2026\n\nEvery work of literary fiction can be analyzed on three basic levels: - the level of the story\/plot - the level of the reader - the level of the author More often than not it doesn't go beyond the first two levels, i.e. what is the story and what is it trying to say, if anything? And what does it mean to me as a reader? What do I take from it? Only the truly great novels have that third level, the level on which the author either subtly or overtly makes you aware of his presence. This can be done in the guise of an omniscient narrator or more subtle, through language,\u2026LOST HIGHWAY was released in the early Spring of 1997, when I had just recently graduated high school and was in the midst of a full-fledged David Lynch obsession. I couldn't make heads or tails of the film back then, but I sure loved it. I watched it so many times that even though I hadn't seen it in probably a decade, when I watched it today I still remembered virtually everything about it.\n\nOne of Lynch's darkest and most challenging works, it is essentially a deeply psychological thriller about male jealousy and insecurity, focusing on a brooding jazz musician (Bill Pullman), who is convinced that his wife (Patricia Arquette) is having an affair. She winds up dismembered in theWeirdest experience ever. GORGEOUS 35mm print at the Coolidge, and that opening sequence just had be absorbed from the get-go.\n\nBut I was half in the bag and operating on little sleep so I was fading in and out during the whole thing. In little doses, but enough to certainly make this David Lynch delirium into something even more surreal. I felt like I was having the weirdest fucking dream and it was pretty awesome just for the experience alone.\n\nThat being said, I'll have to give this a revisit one of these days to confirm but yeah, what a ride.\n\nWhen he is exploring his sexual fantasies, Lynch is one of contemporary cinema's finest narrative surrealists. When he's exploiting those same fantasies, it feels sordid and malicious. This is the latter....I believe it was the legendary Homer Simpson who once gave the ideal description on David Lynch productions. During watching a 'Twin Peaks'-episode he said, `Brilliant\u2026but I don't get it'. Too true\u2026you love what you're seeing and you want to be a part of the mysterious Lynch universe! You actually feel the urge to search for solutions, you want to solve the riddle that is Lost Highway and you desperately try to do so\u2026until you realize it's in fact a puzzle that cannot be solved. Therefore, my advice would be: Don't try to be Einstein and develop too many 'theories'\u2026 just get overwhelmed by Lost Highway and enjoy the mixture of weirdness, violence and erotica you\u2026\n\nThere are several films which have a mystery in their storyline. But there are just a few films which are a mystery as a whole. And these are films made by David Lynch.\n\nThere is a term called kafkaesque which is defined as Something which is marked by a senseless, disorienting, often menacing complexity. For film lovers this term can be changed to LYNCHIAN.\n\nMan, he is a genius. This film leaves the user to fill in the blanks. The beauty is that those blanks can be filled in a million fucking ways. Ask ten different people about their interpretation of this film and you will get ten different answers. Some may not give an answer at all."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of a movie that is so sadly underrated and unknown to many.\n\nLeafie, A Hen into the Wild is one of the most touching animated films I have ever seen that involves animals. It is based off a popular children's book by Hwang Sun-mi.\n\nIt has the feel of a Western animated feature but the undeniable grief and hardship often exhibited in Eastern drama films.\n\nThe concept is fairly simple. Leafie is a hen who is confined to an egg farm and dreams of simply going outside to the yard. By playing dead, Leafie is taken out of the farm and dumped in a landfill where the farmer puts all his dead hens. Thankfully she lives and discovers the beauty of the wild. In the wild she meets lots of new characters but especially grows fond of a handsome mallard whom she calls Wanderer. Chaos ensues and Leafie is left to take over the egg that Wanderer and his beloved left behind. The movie primarily focuses on Leafie and her new duck son, Greenie.\n\nAs silly as that all sounds, the movie is done exceptionally well. It's seriously unbelievable how a story with such childish-sounding characters can be so touching and heartfelt.\n\nThe art is top notch, very close to the quality you would have seen from Disney animated features. The backgrounds are all hand drawn and very beautifully done. It gives the movie a kind of children's story book feel which fits the movie perfectly since it's based off a book. The only issue I have with the animation is that some frames look like they were done in Flash. Flash animations always have this type of motion animation that looks too smooth to be traditional hand-drawn animation. However, this minor flaw does not tarnish the otherwise incredibly beautiful artwork. The 3D blends incredibly well with the hand-drawn art and it some cases you may not be able to tell them apart. It's just really that well done.\n\nOne thing I really liked about this movie is how each major character has depth. The main antagonist, the One-Eyed Weasel, is seriously a great character. She starts off as that typical bad guy character but as the movie progresses we see her character become humanized and empathetic.\n\nDespite how much I love this movie, it does have its flaws. As expected from an animated feature, there are some parts that are well--childish. At one point in the movie there is a competition. The scene is described like an Olympics sports event which is kind of amusing but doesn't make a whole lot of sense. They're in THE WILD. Animals DO NOT HAVE MICROPHONES. Seriously, the side characters narrating the scene had no equipment of any sort (except for some kind of log...microphone) so I have no idea how they'd be able to narrate a fast-flying competition unless they were following the competitors (and they weren't).\nAnd of course there is the character design of Wanderer which is so hilariously bishonen that many people who watched this movie couldn't help but laugh. I have to admit, it made ME want to watch the movie because it's just so hilarious to see a BISHONEN DUCK. Aside from Wanderer, there are other characters with distinct features that you seriously wouldn't find on any wild animal. To be honest it reminds me of what Don Bluth does with his animal characters. This isn't a huge flaw but it could make the story hard to take seriously for some people.\nLike any Western animated feature that this film clearly takes a lot of inspiration from, there are parts where it focuses on side characters doing silly things. This isn't necessarily a flaw but there are some parts that are so childishly dumb that adults might feel it to be off-putting. One example of this is when Leafie finds Mr. Otter literally taking a dump and then falling off a rock. No idea what was up with that scene and I felt it to be pretty unnecessary among other unnecessarily disgusting \"funny\" moments.\n\nOverall though, Leafie, A Hen into the Wild, is an absolutely gorgeous movie and I can only hope this gets an official English release at some point.read more\n\nUpon seeing a poster or trailer for this movie, one might think, \"But chickens and ducks are for eating! Who'd want to see a story about them?\"\n\nStrangely enough, it works. Director Oh Seung-Yoon tackles the subject matter with firm and unyielding compassion, making the audience feel for a hen like never before.\n\nThe storyline treads no new ground as far as morals go. Find your own destiny. Make your own mark. The circle of life goes on. These are all things we've seen before, sure, but Leafie manages to make it seem new anyhow, with colorful music that expands and contracts with every passing scene. The pure creativity of the characters manages to reinvigorate the film, despite its pedestrian plot.\n\nThe artwork on this film is nothing short of brilliant. Backgrounds look like expertly crafted paintings one would expect to find in a museum, and each character has his own distinct look. Unfortunately, the animation is choppy in a few places, jarring the audience from the otherwise completely engrossing world.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, Leafie, a Hen Into the Wild manages to soar higher than most all modern animated films.read more"}
{"text":"Nicole Kidman isn't the star of Alejandro Amenabar's \"The Others.\" Her skin is. Has it ever been paler or clammier-looking? Her flesh is part of the mise- en-scene. Clever as the film is, though, it turns out to be an exercise in narrative withholding more headache-provoking than suspense-laden.\n\n\"The Others\" flirts with sincere metaphysical psych-outs as it tries to communicate Grace's (Kidman) situation. She's an ultra-Christian World War II widow fidgeting in her haunted mansion off the northern coast of England. Not long ago, her housekeeping staff vanished, which meant preparing meals and looking after her light-phobic son and daughter (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) by herself. One day, a creepy three-person replacement housekeeping crew, led by Fionnula Flanagan, arrives to help.\n\nAmenabar, who wrote and directed \"The Others,\" is Spain's burgeoning \"it\" auteur. His film is predicated on a panicky Kidman running from one room to the next, growing in fury and exasperation as the narrative tightens nooselike around her. Amenabar keeps everyone in the dark until revealing a convoluted supernatural hoax in the final scene.\n\n\"The Others\" is as hardworking as, if less frenzied than, Amenabar's other features. Here he has fashioned a tonal and stylistic tribute to the eerie kid- fright of \"The Spirit of the Beehive,\" \"The Sixth Sense\" and to Hitchcock."}
{"text":"It isn't likely to land many converts, but Blue Like Jazz (2 1\/2 stars out of four; opens today; rated PG-13) is just earnest enough to blend its religious theme with a beer-chugging hero for a surprisingly contemporary look at faith.\n\nBased on Donald Miller's best-seller about his struggles with Christianity, Jazz distinguishes itself by creating a young protagonist filled with doubts \u2014 that he's willing to act on.\n\nMarshall Allman plays Don, the son of an evangelical mother (Jenny Littleton) and a deadbeat atheist dad (an effective Eric Lange). Worried that his son will be brainwashed at a Christian college, he enrolls him at the liberal Reed College in Portland, Ore. Hoping to look beyond his Texas Baptist upbringing, Don agrees.\n\nThe movie establishes a nice tone early on, when father and son discuss the merits of college: Dad worries that his son will join a cult. Son reminds him that while Dad was skipping child support, the church was donating food and clothes. It's not a theological debate, but a touching exchange between a father and son who will never see eye-to-eye.\n\nThe film comes off track a little when Don arrives on campus, where he's greeted with free condoms and lectures about the hazards of bottled water. Director Steve Taylor, who did the 2006 Christian-themed film The Second Chance, paints college as a cafeteria of vice, run by good kids lost in a grown-up world.\n\nBut some of the talks Don has with fellow students, particularly about feeling like an outcast because he believes in Jesus, ring true. The film even glances (albeit fleetingly) at the sexual abuses roiling the Catholic church.\n\nMake no mistake: This is a Christian movie with Jesus as an uncredited executive producer. The doubters depicted are either narrow-minded or priest-abuse victims. Christianity, not Islam, not Judaism, not Buddhism, is the sole path. One academic atheist tells students that since there is no God, a math book should provide them all the answers they need.\n\nThe swipes aren't necessary, as Allman (True Blood, Prison Break) does a more than capable job of playing the believer with suspicions. His conflict, amplified by the sudden availability of sex and booze, doesn't need an addendum.\n\nStill, give film credit for acknowledging another side exists. Don gets a little preachy by the film's finale, but Jazz is one of those rare Christian-based films that classifies its followers as a \"subset\" of American society, one that's often ridiculed. While Jazz occasionally takes the bully pulpit, the film hits its stride when it's living modestly for a cause, not dying loudly for one."}

Raghu is an alcoholic but it is the events in his life that brings a change. What are those changes forms the rest of the story.\n\nPresentation: The director has come up with an interesting storyline and while the presentation was good, the narrative was involving. The dialogues were meaningful, the script was strong and the screenplay was catchy. Background score was decent and the songs were worth humming. Cinematography was appealing. Editing was crisp and tight. Costumes were elegant while the art department was adequate. Mohanlal came up with yet another riveting performance, he was fabulous. Kaniha was good, Nandhu was natural, Siddharth was effective, Thilakan made his presence felt, Shankar Ramakrishnan was superb. Govindan, Lena and Madhu were apt.\n\nConclusion: One of the best genres that appeals to today's audience is contemporary subjects that they can connect to in real life. This film works due to the quality in its making and the higher degree of performances from the cast. While the first half goes about with the layering of the plot, the second half gets into few dramatic twists and strong emotions. Overall, the film scores due to the way it conveys a message and how life is depicted. At the box office, this would be an above average treat."}

The bonus is that every time Colter returns to the train, he has another chat with Christina (Michelle Monaghan).\n\nThe buzz: Director Duncan Jones (\"Moon\") returns for another mind-bending mission of ever-shifting identities, driven by technology that doesn't currently exist (as far as we know). The script by Ben Ripley brings to mind everything from \"Inception\" and \"Groundhog Day\" to \"Final Destination\" and \"The Adjustment Bureau.\"\n\nThe verdict: Jones is certainly carving himself a specific niche: ambitious and strange intellectual thrillers that raise numerous challenging ideas but don't actually analyze them. \"Source Code,\" which continually switches between suspenseful and silly, doesn't have the transporting scenery of \"Moon\" or a lead performance with as much depth. The movie also has far too many near-endings; this didn't have to become a love story, and it really didn't have to throw its own logic out the window while maintaining a tunnel-vision sense of morality.

{"text":"wizardly stop-motion animation of ParaNorman is something to behold. Not since Coraline has the onscreen world of a non-live-action production felt so dense and tactile. This is no coincidence, since Chris Butler and Sam Fell's film comes from the same Oregon-based animation studio.\n\nBut where Coraline made mesmerizing visual poetry out of its slender coming-of-age storyline, ParaNorman is essentially a trifle\u2014and an entertaining and technically adroit one at that. Not that Butler's script doesn't occasionally aim for more; it's just that it only achieves mixed results. That the protagonist is a moody junior-high-schooler who can talk to ghosts (hence his titular nickname) is a humorously ghoulish premise; what's a bit of a stretch is using this cartoon Sixth Sense conceit to try to examine America's Puritan roots. So when Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) realizes that the long-deceased witch who is turning his suburban hometown into a slapstick episode of The Walking Dead was really just a lost little kid at the mercy of religious zealots, the film comes off as mawkish in a way that Coraline never did.\n\nOn the other hand, Coraline wasn't nearly as funny as ParaNorman, which is jammed with clever sight gags (a few of which are as imaginatively morbid as anything in Beetlejuice) and genuinely well-integrated pop culture allusions (as opposed to drecky Shrek-style sops to a mainstream audience). Even if Butler and Fell's attempts at emotional resonance come up short, you have to admire a movie that includes a deceptively offhand revelation about a minor character's sexuality.

{"text":"A 'Bright' new film\n\nMovie about poet Keats, Brawne told with love onscreen\n\nEntomologists revere the butterfly as one of the most stunning phenomena in nature \u2014 the homely caterpillar emerges from its chrysalis as a creature of flight. The three-year romance between poet John Keats and high fashion disciple Fanny Brawne portrayed in the film \"Bright Star\" is as ethereal and beautiful as the life of the butterfly. Just as the caterpillar completes a metamorphosis, the film transforms the public image of John Keats from one confined to bookshelves to one that has swooped intriguingly into pop culture.\n\nWritten and directed by Jane Campion (\"The Piano\"), the film begins with a hand calmly stitching while violin music resonates in the background and the melodic sounds of both a male and female singing voice fill the theater. The film's subtly sensual beginning suits the poet it portrays, as Keats believed poetry should be experienced through the senses.\n\nHampstead Village, London in 1818 provides the setting for the film and revives the romanticized image of the English countryside culture composed of rustling satin frocks, fields of swaying lavender and cups of tea sipped from bone china. What began as a social call and basket of biscuits sparks the passionate love affair between John Keats (Ben Whishaw, \"Brideshead Revisited\") and Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish, \"Stop-Loss\").\n\nThe debt Keats has acquired providing for his sick brother Tom dooms the relationship from the outset. When the Brawne family moves into the adjacent half of the house from Keats and his close friend Charles Armitage Brown (Paul Schneider, \"Drunk History\"), Fanny's coy provocation provides a temptation too great to for Keats to resist.\n\nFanny serves as the epicenter for the developing chemistry in the film, clashing with Brown and enticing Keats. Fanny, a woman who exudes haute couture, seems almost an anachronism in a century that favors demure simplicity. While the eldest Brawne daughter inspires much gossip among the neighbors, her free spirit allows the contemporary woman to connect with her highly individualistic views making \"Bright Star\" a modern love story despite its historical setting.\n\nThe cinematography perfectly captures the social impossibility of their love. In one scene, Keats strides furiously across a sodden moor, followed by Brown who attempts to pacify him and Brawne who seeks to plead with him. Taken from an aerial perspective, the shot juxtaposes the dark colors worn by Keats and Brown compared with the bright pink worn by Brawne. This contrast casts Brawne as a woman similar to Hester Prynne from \"The Scarlet Letter,\" causing controversy wherever she walks.\n\nDespite the film's electric pulse, it strangely lacks physicality. Keats' determination to have a chaste love affair with Brawne will satisfy only viewers who appreciate patience. The film lacks the overt demonstrations of love audiences have come to expect from Hollywood, the all-too-common \"bear-all mentality.\" Instead, intimate moments between Keats and Brawne are interrupted further reinforcing the hopelessness of their relationship. But, the sheer rawness of emotion created by Whishaw and Cornish amply fills the void created by the lack of physical contact.\n\nCampion employed much symbolism in \"Bright Star\" as she no doubt strives for another Academy Award feather to add to her cap already decorated with a Palme d'Or and a Georges Sadoul award among others. Light symbolizes the bright love that burns between Keats and Brawne \u2014 the first time Keats and Brawne explicitly touch a fire crackles in the background providing the only sound in the scene. The pain and excitement of first love weaves a cocoon of emotional complexity around the symbols used in the film.\n\nAbbie Cornish shines in her portrayal of the obsessive Franny Brawne. After Keats compares their love to a butterfly in one letter, Fanny transforms her room into a butterfly farm. The iridescent wings of the butterflies as they alight on her clothes and wistful face mirror the vividness of her devotion. The spectrum of emotion she portrays is impressive. At the end of the film, as she grips the banister, the audience realizes the intense pain of unrealized love through her anguished moans.\n\nThe three-year romance between John Keats and Fanny Brawne captured by \"Bright Star\" weaves inexorably with the three-day life of a butterfly. Like the butterfly, the film represents the vitality and transience of young love. With costumes that range from haute couture to frocks of patterned elegance, symbolic cinematography and powerful acting, \"Bright Star\" will surely soar come Oscar season.\n\nWorst. Lead. Ever. Couldn't even finish the rest of the review. I get that there's some kind of butterfly symbolism in the movie. I could not have missed it. Perhaps this reviewer should take a page out of Campion's book and learn about subtlety."}

The first word of the book, the neologism Doukipudonktan is a phonetic transcription of D'o\u00f9 qu'il pue donc tant ? (\"How come he stinks so much?\"). In the English version of the novel, this is rendered as \"Holifart watastink\".

Louis Malle was a versatile kinda guy.\n\nCheeky Zazie - like Amelie's evil, foul-mouthed kid sister - is staying with her uncle and aunt in Paris for a few days, but manages to lead half the city on a merry dance and several Benny Hill-style pursuits. She never gets to go on the Metro, as she's been dreaming of - it's on strike, so she has to find other ways to amuse herself. Ultimately, not an awful lot actually happens except people running about and shouting, the odd bit\u2026\n\nIf you ever wondered how a film with the spirit of Looney Tunes as humans filtered through the eyes of the French New Wave, look no further than Zazie dans le M\u00e9tro. Right from the beginning it is an over powering experience throwing all sorts of sight gags and word play at you in addition to a mountain of surreal images. The film is absolutely saturated with Zazie's madcap energy which Louis Malle brings to life with a big bag of cinematic techniques such as wild jump cuts, fast motion chase sequences, vertigo-inducing camera angles and rapid fire editing. The Eiffel Tower scenes themselves are a master class at using camera angles and scale to create something that is larger\u2026Schooled by Keaton, Chaplin and Tex Avery, and school for Ricard Lester, Monty Python, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Wes Anderson, Malle presents a slapstick fairytale of working class Paris 1960. Marvelous nods to M\u00e9tro architecture, les toits de Paris, its arcades, quays and flea markets, and better than Hitchcock or M\u00e9li\u00e8s, the Eiffel Tower, with street \"sets\" designed by William Klein. Fancy a little Grenadine? \u00c0 la soupe a l'oignon!Zazie Dans Le Metro is Louis Malle's satire on French society. The film's style is wacky and reminiscent of Keystone Cops at times. The characters are purposely exaggerated to mock the kinds of people who compose French society.\n\nThe story centers around 12-year-old Zazie who stays 2 days in Paris with her uncle, while her mother has a romance. Zazie is precocious, foul-mouthed, and more worldly than all the adults around her.\n\nReally thrilling early Malle film with a great use of colour, editing, Paris, etc. It's clear that the youthful energy and the thrill of experimentation that define the French New Wave were alive and well on the set of Zazie. It tumbles into lunacy by the end but for just about everything prior the film is greatly compelling - you never know what could happen next as classical time and space simply become elastic bands for Malle and Co. to fling around."}

{"text":"Chronicle Reviews (2012)\n\nOne of the central tenets of both the X-Men comic books and the films spawned from them is that humans are terrified of mutants. Their special powers set them apart from the rest of humanity, and in many powerless human's minds, that makes them a threat. With X-Men, we generally tend to side with the mutant race, since they have Charles Xavier around to teach his X-Men about how to use their powers for the purposes of good. But what if Professor X weren't around to guide these young powerhouses? What if there were just a bunch of Magnetos, Juggernauts, and Pyros running around wreaking havoc on everything? Your opinion might differ slightly, then.\n\nChronicle attempts to address the idea of impressionable young minds suddenly emboldened by superhuman abilities in a more realistic, less blockbustery fashion. Its method is to delve into the suddenly extremely popular found footage genre, turning its tale of three teens of varying levels of angstiness whose lives are turned upside down by inexplicable telekinetic powers into something of a cross between X-Men: First Class and Cloverfield. It's actually kind of shocking that nobody had thought of it before. Even more shocking is how well Chronicle handles the challenges of its premise.\n\nInitially we meet Andrew (Dane DeHaan) and Matt (Alex Russell), two related suburban Seattle teenagers who are, for various reasons, something of social outcasts. Matt's handsome and not altogether disliked, but also highly invested in reading philosophy texts and quoting to others why this whole world is, like, bullshit, man. Andrew's issues are perhaps a bit more dire. His drunken father regularly abuses him, his sickly mother is on the verge of death, and he's little more than a creepy punching bag for the kids at school. For reasons that mostly seem to exist to carry the plot forward, Andrew begins filming everything around him, including a rave at an abandoned barn that Matt drags him to. Somewhere over the course of that night, they hook up with Steve (Michael B. Jordan), the star school athlete and soon-to-be class president, and find themselves on the outskirts of the property near a mysterious cave that pulses with both light and an imposing sound. See if you can guess what happens next.\n\nYes, the introduction to all of this is contrived as hell. Thankfully, first time director Josh Trank and screenwriter Max Landis (son of John Landis) don't spend much more time trying to explain away why any of this is any of this. Suffice it to say, mysterious things have suddenly turned them into something other than merely human. It starts off small, with them simply tossing baseballs at each other and playing minor pranks on people--that poor girl who suddenly found herself facing a floating, seemingly sentient teddy bear is probably scarred for life--but soon they begin to realize that the more they use their powers, the stronger they get. It's not long before they're learning how to use telekinesis to stop objects from penetrating their bodies, and flying through the sky like bro-dude supermen.\n\nThere is perhaps no greater truth than the innate understanding that to everyone but teenagers themselves, teenagers are insufferable creatures that deserve little more than scorn and disdain. Watching realistic teenager behavior is like watching monkeys in the wild fling shit at one another. It's maybe a little bit interesting from an anthropological perspective, but you'll be glad to keep your distance from it.\n\nCredit to both Landis' script and the actors portraying these teens then that you don't find yourself hating them as the movie goes along--except when you're very clearly supposed to. As angsty and overwrought as their behavior can get, they never veer too far into the unlikable category. Their journey of discovery (and eventual conflict) is an entertaining ride that, at times, actually feels pretty authentic. Landis' script has a good sense of the way teenagers think, which is to say that self-gratification tends to take precedence over responsibility or rational thinking. He crafts a number of ridiculous but fun scenarios for them to both come to grips with new abilities, and suddenly realize they have no idea what they're actually doing. When they're flying around in the sky, it seemingly never occurs to them that, hey, an airplane might come tearing through there at some point and knock them back on their hovering asses. The consequences of their powers aren't lost on them, but in an effort to amuse themselves, and even help Andrew become a bit more popular, they aren't opposed to showing off a bit to impress their classmates.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the honeymoon doesn't last. Andrew's grim home life and tortured school life seem like ripe fodder for him to go Columbine times a thousand at just about any moment, and eventually his darker urges take over. He begins comparing his abilities to nature's food chain, and other humans as lower forms of life to be squashed. He scowls, broods, and obliterates with reckless abandon, leading to a showdown between he and Matt in downtown Seattle that combines the chaos and insanity of Cloverfield's better action sequences with a live action rendition of the end of Akira.\n\nThe trick, of course, is how Trank chooses to capture all of this. In order to keep up the found footage gimmick, Landis' script has Andrew keeping the camera with him at just about all times, even sometimes having it float above him as he goes about his business. But what about when Andrew isn't around? Landis inserts a minor love interest for Matt, a pretty blonde (Ashley Hinshaw) who also has a penchant for filming random things, purportedly for her blog. And when she isn't around, Trank darts between security cam footage, cop car cameras, and whatever else might be in the vicinity to edit together his more fast-paced action sequences into something surprisingly compelling. It's also pretty hokey and ridiculous, and requires a good bit of suspension of disbelief to completely buy into. But if you're capable of bringing your brain past that one particularly formidable barrier to entry, you'll likely enjoy what Chronicle has to offer."}
{"text":"Derailed\n\nI have to admit that Derailed is a film I knew next to nothing about before seeing it. I didn\u00edt even remember hearing the movie\u00eds title before being assigned to review it - never a great sign for a picture. Interestingly enough, as I watched the movie I vaguely recalled once seeing a trailer for it, but it was obviously not something memorable. Over time I suspect the same will hold true for the film itself.\n\nDerailed starts as what seems to be the setup for a modern Fatal Attraction. Clive Owen plays Charles Schine, a man with a moderately happy marriage that\u00eds been strained due to his daughter\u00eds illness (type-I diabetes). By chance, one day he meets Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston), a beautiful and intelligent woman, and the two quickly discover how much they have in common, like moderately-happy marriages. Their interest inevitably leads them to a clandestine meeting in a hotel room, and that\u00eds when the story gets \u010fderailed\u0112.\n\nInstead of the intended affair of passion, the two find themselves at gunpoint as a man breaks into their room. The criminal proceeds to rob them and rape Lucinda, but the real crime comes as the two realize they can\u00edt go to the authorities without revealing to their respective spouses why they were in the hotel to begin with. The crook begins to take advantage of this, shaking Charles down for more money and delivering threats to harm all of the women in Charles's life, from Lucinda to his wife and even his ailing daughter, if he doesn't pay up.\n\nDerailed is not a great film, but it\u00eds not a bad one either. It\u00eds a mediocre movie that begins as a drama and slowly moves over into suspense as the audience wonders when and where the criminal, Laroche (Vincent Cassel), will show up next. It\u00eds a neat trick watching the film set the audience up for one type of story and then suddenly change into a different type of movie altogether. It is a transition, however, that isn't done as quickly as I would have liked, leaving far too much of the movie behind before any action really gets going. On the other hand, that early part of the movie really allows things to be set up so that, when things do get going, we know these characters are and most of their motivations. This makes it even more agonizing later on when Charles has to make a decision about paying off Laroche when we know that the money he has to use is earmarked for his daughter\u00eds future treatments.\n\nMy largest complaint about Derailed is how much of the movie\u00eds plot relies on the complete and total idiocy of the main character. In fact, Charles\u00eds stupidity goes so far that, after a point, he loses the sympathy of the audience. It\u00eds hard to feel bad for the situation Charles gets into when, no matter how bad things get, he refuses to do anything about it. He\u00eds an unwitting target that never seems to get wise or do the right thing. For that matter, he doesn't even do what just about any other person in his situation would do. Watching Charles continually placed in a tough situation ends up getting frustrating, especially since so much of it is his own fault, and you just want to shout at the character regardless of his inability to hear you.\n\nJennifer Aniston\u00eds role in the film is a decided departure from her previous work. From the moment she first appears on screen she exudes a different personality then I\u00edve ever seen her play before. It\u00eds a more mature Aniston then the one that appeared on television for years as Rachel, and a real sign that she may have some long term lasting power in Hollywood. She\u00eds also one of the strongest performances, although that\u00eds not saying much. Owen and Cassel remain in safe territory for the most part, sticking with the types of personalities they\u00edve played before. Think of Charles as Owen in Sin City minus the intelligence and most of the sin, and Cassel just plays a rougher version of his Oceans 12 character. The rest of the main characters are rounded out by rappers (Xzibit and RZA), making for an extremely strange mix in the cast.\n\nAs I said, Derailed is not a bad film, but neither is it a great film. It\u00eds entertaining enough while watching it, if you can ignore just how ridiculously poor the lead character is in making decisions. However, after a few hours there is little about the movie that will stay with you. If you\u00edre in the mood for a movie that won\u00edt challenge you as a viewer, but will just help you pass the time, you\u00edre in luck. Derailed won\u00edt knock you off any sort of mental track."}

In the 1980s, Vallanzasca (played enigmatically by Kim Rossi Stuart) worked his way to the top of Milan's crime scene, using brute force to dispatch his rivals and pulling off a series of daring robberies. Placido successfully captures the spirit of the times with breathless pacing and stunning set-pieces...

{"text":"Biopics That Don't Suck\n\nSo many biopics, so little time. For every good movie about someone's life, there are twenty more that just lazily go through the motions. We look for some diamonds in the rough, so you don't have to. Here are the biopics that don't suck.\n\nEd Wood\n\nEd Wood gets everything right when it comes to biopics. It's filled with crazy characters but gives them heart. It tells a story most people probably aren't familiar with. And most importantly, it limits itself to the most important years of its subject's life.\n\nBy focusing on Ed Wood's friendship with horror legend Bela Lugosi, the film wisely gets to both humanize Ed Wood and examine his outlandish personality, since those years coincided with the making of his most memorable films. We don't see Ed Wood as a child, and we don't see him as an old man. We see Ed Wood only as a crazy filmmaker, which is all we really need to see."}

{"text":"Parents say\n\nKids say\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nParents need to know that this black-and-white, 1940s-style \"film noir\" isn't likely to appeal to kids. Its plot includes references to Nazis, war crimes, and the atomic bomb, as well as lots of strong language and violence (beyond what typified the era). Characters frequently say \"f--k\"; there's also one use of \"c--t\" and an anti-Semitic remark. Violence includes beating, kicking, and shooting (resulting in bloody wounds). Sexual imagery includes a woman stripping, a rough sexual act (the woman's figure and face are in shadow), and some kissing. Several references are made to Lena's work as a prostitute. Characters smoke incessantly (it's 1945) and drink like fish.\n\nAn explicit sexual act (woman in shadows on bed, man has sex from behind her); Hannelore performs feather\/strip dance in club (shadowy); Hannelore strips to her underwear and invites Jake to have sex with her (using explicit language); Hannelore and Lena work as prostitutes (discussed frequently).\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nIn 1945 Germany, reporter Capt. Jake Gesimar (George Clooney) arrives in Germany to cover the Potsdam Peace Conference. He immediately clashes with his younger driver, Corporal Tully (Tobey Maguire). Where Jake is principled, if cynical, Tully is at once na\u00efve and slick, and involved in criminal activities. The men's differences come to a head over a prostitute named Lena (Cate Blanchett) who's currently Tully's girlfriend and was formerly Jake's lover. Soon Jake is embroiled in a murder case involving the insidious Russian General Sikorsky (Ravil Isaynov) and covered up by crafty U.S. Colonel Muller (Beau Bridges). Jack is helped and stymied by Congressman Breimer (Jack Thompson) and war crimes prosecutor Bernie Teitel (Leland Orser). Bernie is an old friend of Jake's and doesn't trust him, but is invested enough in tracking down the now-scurrying-away Nazis that he makes deals with whomever will help him do it, be it Jake or the U.S. military.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nThe Good German is Steven Soderbergh's latest expansion of stylistic and thematic boundaries. Shot in black and white, the movie focuses on the moral and political dilemmas emerging from the Potsdam Peace Conference, where, an epigraph asserts, Harry Truman, Winston Churchill, and Josef Stalin gathered to \"draw the postwar map.\"\n\nLena and Jake's passionate past -- as well as a scene at a rainy airport -- evokes Rick and Ilsa in Casablanca. But Jake's efforts to do the right thing are repeatedly complicated by others' greed and desire for vengeance. This thoughtful, complex film ends with a Stars & Stripes headline announcing that the United States has just dropped the atomic bomb on Japan. Even as WWII comes to a horrific end, the Cold War is already in motion attempts to mimic 1940s style and culture. How is the era presented differently in this movie than in films actually from that time period? How does the movie's explicit language and violent imagery alter your idea of what 1944 might have been like? How do Lena and Jake form a romantic couple that is at once old-fashioned (sentimental, nostalgic) and like those in present-day movies (cynical, passionate)?"}
{"text":"If you've ever seen a heist movie before, the plot of Dobermann will hold no surprises. There's the criminals, the police on their tail, the obligatory double cross and the final stand off. What makes Dobermann special is the complete lack of restraint in the both the script and the direction which leaves the film as a violent, nihilistic slice of Euro cool.\n\nVincent Cassel stars as the titular Dobermann, leader of a gang of notorious bank robbers who are stalked by mental cop Cristini and his squad. Alongside Dob is his deaf girlfriend Nat The Gypsy, played by Cassel's then girlfriend, now wife, Monica Bellucci. Their bond is clear from the explosive chemistry between them. It's also a testament to her as an actress to see how lively her performance is when she only says one word through the entire running time and only occasionally signs through the rest. Some of the best scenes in the movie are the ones focused on her. The contrast between her muted scenes and the crazy sounds of the rest of the film is not only an interesting touch but plot relevant. Like the rest of the characters, there is very little depth but enough of a personality quirk there to make everyone from the constantly bubblegum chewing Mostique to the Bible paraphrasing L'Abbe immediately recognizable and memorable.\n\nCassel is as electric as ever with the bad boy charm that made his portrayal of Jacques Mesrine so riveting turned up to an effortless eleven. Tcheky Karyo's performance as his rival is just as spectacular with what can only really be called a descent into madness. I feel describing his arc as a descent is selling it short: From the opening scenes, his blind obsession with catching Dobermann is intense enough but by the halfway point of the film, he's already cracked and by the time he faces off with Cassel, he's completely off the rails. Becoming more violent, crazy, and unstable with every scene, not to mention his inexplicable use of English phrases, Cristini is one of the best villains I've come across in years and a good part of this success is the tone of the film itself.\n\nDirector Jan Kounen has taken the manic world of the Dobermann comic book and brought it to life on the big screen. With fast paced editing, extreme zoom shots, ridiculous special effects and a pulsing techno soundtrack by the aptly named Schyzomaniac and a welcome cameo track from The Prodigy, the film carries a crazy style that is rarely matched. In the modern era where B-Movies are often either parodied or overly revered, it's refreshing to see a film play all those tropes completely straight leaving the viewer experiencing a sense of organised confusion, not just layers of references to poke fun at. The film is from 1997 but feels more fresh and lively than a lot of the more recent examples of grindhouse pastiche.\n\nAdmittedly, this roughness makes the film impossible to recommend for everyone. Dobermann is a film that recognises the line of taste and decency but makes every attempt possible to cross it. While incredibly entertaining, there are plenty of scenes that are blatantly offensive, and would be were it not for the pulpy tone of the material. The scene involving Cristini invading drag queen Sonia's meal with his family would be hideous were it given any real gravitas but instead it dips into black comedy enough to remain entertaining. To tell what happens here or elsewhere would ruin half the fun but it's safe to say that if you like your action high octane in a way that only the Europeans can provide, you'll enjoy it.\n\nHowever, after all that praise, I can't give it more than 3 stars due to the quality of the media it's available on. The PAL Region 2 DVD from Tartan, as a 2000 release, is not only barebones but it is a direct VHS transfer in the worst possible way. Terrible aspect ratio, blurry picture quality, flat audio and subtitles hardcoded into the image itself, making some of the lines unreadable. Perhaps in some perverse way, the poor quality of the audio and video enhances the gritty feel, but I can't honestly recommend a purchase of this version to anyone and, as far as I can tell, it's the only version available outside of France."}

Have they not seen the 943 other thriller-in-an-asylum movies?\n\nNow, it's true that this is Scorsese, so it's more stylish than any given made-for-SyFy flick\u2014all misty mysteriousness and some very fine performances, particularly DiCaprio's. But no, I refuse to believe that Scorsese\u2014who made Boxcar Bertha in 1972 for Roger Corman\u2014is unfamiliar with cheap, pulpy, cinematic thrills.\n\nScorsese attacks us, as the film opens, with portents and omens, as a ship slips from the fog of outer Boston harbor approaching remote Shutter Island. The ominous, portentous score booms with portentous omens, as U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his new partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo, also very fine), arrive to investigate the escape of a dangerous prisoner-patient from the hospital for the criminally insane that inhabits the island. Boom BOOM BOOM the music goes, like war drums as Teddy and Chuck have to give up their sidearms and the maximum security gates of the facility bang shut behind them.\n\nFor a while, I tried to keep in mind that maxim, \"Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.\" Maybe something else\u2014something more interesting and fresh than what seems to be obvious, something we hadn't seen 943 times before\u2014would, in fact, turn out to have been going on all along.

{"text":"realizesThree high school friends gain superpowers after making an incredible discovery. Soon, though, they find their lives spinning out of control and their bond tested as they embrace their darker sides.\n\nChronicle is the story of three high school seniors named Andrew Dettmer (Dane DeHaan), Matt Garetty (Alex Russell), and Steve Montgomery (Micheal B. Jordan). Steve is a popular guy, running for student body president. Matt, Andrew's cousin, has never had any shortcomings with popularity or women. Andrew is the opposite. He comes from a poor family, with a dying mother and an alcoholic, abusive father. He never talks to anyone, is regularly bullied, and his only outlet in life is his camera, which he carries with him everywhere. What do these three have in common? Telekinetic abilities, and one flippin' good movie. After stumbling out of the hole where they found a strange crystal formation, they discover they have the ability to change the world around them with their thoughts. They start small with their new powers, building with toy blocks and stopping baseballs in mid-flight, but if they over-do it, their noses start to bleed like a faucet. 'I think it's like a muscle,' Matt said in one scene, 'The more you use it, the stronger it gets.' But after some pranks at the local supermarket, one unfortunate tailgater shows them just how dangerous these abilities are, and Andrew realizes how powerful he can be. As he describes in one scene, he has become an 'Apex Predator,' the highest link on the food chain. Chronicle is a beautiful example of taking aspects of previous films and doing them properly. It has Cloverfield's style of filming, but without the camera shake (he used a tripod, how about that?). The movie is based around the core concept of Andrew filming the events that are happening, and later in the movie, this takes the shape of police dash-cams and other people filming from their windows. External shots of the main characters are cleverly disguised as Andrew 'floating' his camera. The act of telekinesis in the movie is flawlessly done too, there's no flashes or lines to link the action to the character, but the character's movement links to the action. There's no lights or flashes when they use their powers, like in Push. They use hand gestures or head-tilting to show that what they're doing. One of the finest details is the choice of actors, all relatively unknown. (Except Micheal B. Jordan, who was in Friday Night Lights, voiced Jace Stratton in the video games Gears of War 3, and also starred in January's Red Tails.) While this is normally a huge gamble, this is a great example of it paying off. The fact that they're mostly unrecognized adds authenticity to the story. In short, Chronicle is a valuable addition to any movie fans' arsenal!\n\nChronicle(released Feb\/12)stars Dane DeHaan as Andrew Detmer,Michael B. Jordan as Steve Montgomery,Alex Russell as Matt Garetty,Michael Kelly as Richard Detmer,Ashley Hinshaw as Casey Letter and others.This is yet another Blair Witch Project,this time done through the eyes of three Seattle high school students.\"Done\" is the operative word here,as in done this genre right into the ground and done terribly poorly. The film finds Andrew as the school loner.He has a dying mother and an abusive,alcoholic father.Andrew decides to start taking a camera along wherever he goes(quite convenient),and during a party his cousin Matt and his friend Steve take a walk in the nearby woods,and discover a strange hole.Steve gets Andrew to come and film it.In the hole they all go and they come upon a strange crystalline structure at the end of the tunnel.Whatever it is emanates different lights and strange sounds,and when they leave the tunnel their lives slowly start to change.They start to discover they have the powers of psycho-kinesis.Andrew develops it faster and stronger than the others.Whenever something untoward happens to one the others gets nose bleeds.There is a definite symbiosis going on here. At first they start out doing harmless lifting of various objects big and small.As their powers grow they have the ability to literally fly into the air and travel great distances.Andrew however is slowly but surely withdrawing from the others,his home life situation not helping any.After a confrontation with his father,he flies into the clouds and Steve comes to talk to him.It all ends as Andrew pushes Steve away so hard,he falls to earth and dies. Andrews mother grows weaker everyday and when Andrew has no money to pay for his mothers pills he starts robbing his school mates,then a mini-mart.However during the latter a propane tank explodes sending Andrew to the hospital.As his father sits by his bed he reveals Andrew's mother passed away that night.But because he was out looking for him he blames Andrew for him not being able to be there for his wife.As he stands over Andrew demanding an apology,Andrew causes a huge explosion to rip the wall out of the hospital room.This draws the attention of the police and the media.Matt is getting a nose bleed and knows something is wrong.He sees the kerfuffle on TV and speeds to the scene.He is just in time to save Andrews father who is thrown to the ground by a hovering and very angry Andrew.Matt and Andrew have a huge showdown over Seattle and it all comes to a disastrous end when Matt is forced to kill Andrew. The film ends as we find Matt in Tibet.Andrew had said earlier on in the film that they should travel there and they all agreed,except they never made it.This is Matt's way of fulfilling the promise. If I have to sit through another of these cheaply made,Blair Witch like films,I don't know....burning the disc is too good.The only positives I can say is that it is a kind of a neat idea,on paper,and the special effects were well done.Other than that this wanna-be life like picture is a total washout.As life-like as these films try to be,they really are far off the mark.For instance Andrews father belts him across the face and knocks him off his chair.He comes back up with a grimace but nothing else.Reality?....he should have been crying.But hey,this is Hollywood and REAL reality is a no-no.Just pretend reality.And the moral of the story,that man is not meant to have these powers?Yeah,yeah....they did it better in Star Trek,and long before that. Technically speaking the film is in its w\/s a\/r of 1:85:1 and extras include pre-viz stuff & a camera test. All in all another Blair Witch rip off,and done very poorly and uninterestingly at that.The moral is as old as the hills and just as lame.Highly NOT recommended."}

{"text":"I've called Christian Carion's Farewell a \"spy thriller,\" and it is one. In fact, this is one of the most suspenseful films I've seen in some considerable time, but don't let this put you in mind of James Bond. And even though it's a Cold War tale, it has even less to do with Salt. This one is a serious fact-based tale about the Cold War and bringing an end to the Soviet Union. That's not what makes the film remarkable so much as the fact that it's a film about the people the spies are. That's the detail that makes Farewell unusual and unusually satisfying. That it's also very stylish and crafted with an eye toward suspense, on the other hand, shouldn't be sold short.\n\nThe story concerns a man, Pierre Froment (Guillaume Canet, Tell No One), who is not a spy in any sense of the word, but whose boss taps him to ferry information from the Russians to the French secret service. It isn't a task Froment likes, nor is it one he's really equipped for on any level. Moreover, the Soviet contact, Sergei Gregoriev (Emir Kusturica, The Good Thief), a man supposedly above suspicion, isn't exactly delighted to find himself working with an amateur\u2014at least at first. Partly what changes lies in the fact that Gregoriev is a patriot, who believes that Russia has to change in order to survive. He isn't after money for his services\u2014though he accepts some decadent Western goodies like champagne and a Walkman and some Queen albums for his son. Gregoriev truly wants to help his country. As things progress, he and Froment become friends of a sort\u2014tied together, in part, because they are the only ones who can even discuss what they're doing.\n\nThe characters are at the center of Farewell, but the film's players\u2014like the story it tells\u2014are drawn from a pretty broad spectrum, including Ronald Reagan (Fred Ward), who is presented as both a fairly formidable adversary, a bit of a paranoid and a man who can only understand the world by reducing it to the level of movies he's either seen or been in. It's an odd portrayal, but it does tend to match up with the facts as we know them, even while obviously being an interpretation. This isn't to say that the film is a leftist screed that paints the Soviets in glowing colors. Far from it, since nothing about Farewell suggests that the regime Gregoriev is helping to destroy is in any way admirable.\n\nIt would be a mistake to give away too much about the actual breakdown of events here. This is the kind of film that works better if seen cold. The more you let the film lead you in without much knowledge of anything beyond the basic premise, the more profoundly I think it will affect you. Knowing that this is a movie that puts a truly human face on espionage is enough. I suspect the film's subtleties, in terms of character development over the course of the story, would only improve on a second viewing. Still, it would be a grave disservice to give away the progression of the plot, which you need to see for yourself\u2014and I hope you take the time to do so. For me, this is the film everyone told me The Lives of Others (2006) was\u2014except this time I actually found it to be so. Not rated sounds like a very interesting movie and I definitely plan to watch it but I'm not finding much about it on the Internet - IMDb just says it has a September 2009 release in Belgium! Has it arrived in Asheville earlier than the rest of the US"}

The fact that it's even playing in theaters is mindblowing for me. Uh\u2026 so\u2026 I'll come back to answer some questions if you have any afterwards but this movie was meant to be more like the kind of thing you could imagine being buried in a ditch somewhere or floating in a Ziploc bag down a river or if a convict had shoved it in the ass of a horse or something. It's just a\u2014well anyway, you'll see. It's like that. I'll see you afterwards.\"\n\nAnd that's how Harmony Korine introduced his new movie, Trash Humpers, to an audience at Cinema Village in New York last Friday. The lights came down veee-eee-eeee-eeerryyyy slo-oooo-ooowly and the movie began. Trash Humpers has a real loose narrative structure. Four old people (played by Harmony and his friends in scary masks) break shit, terrorize people and hump all sorts of inanimate objects. There's a lot of chanting, people performing for one another, and repetition. The whole movie was shot on VHS and the surprise noise burps and static that creates, as well as the grain of the VHS, are beautiful to look at. I'd forgotten how nice VHS looks. What once looked mediocre now looks special.\n\nI don't know if there's more to discuss about the movie beyond the things that Harmony Korine volunteers. While the end credits were on the screen, Harmony came out and did a Q&A.\n\nAudience: \"Did you shoot on VHS?\"\nHarmony Korine: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n\"How much footage that was shot made it into the movie and how much was cut?\"\nThe movie's presented in the way it was shot, so each day was like a chapter. The characters would sleep out in the woods or behind strip malls or under bridges. We'd get these big tractor tires and we'd fill them up with hay and sleep there, like nests. We would wake up the next morning and knock on doors. Usually we'd start filming an hour or two before it got dark. It was easier to disappear. Pretty much everything we shot is in the film. There was no coverage the way you'd cover a movie. I wasn't even thinking of it in terms of narrative moviemaking where there are scenes. It was more of a collection of moments. I would never do something more than once. If it happened and we happened to be recording it then it would be in the movie, kind of like a home movie. If I started to edit the film and think about it, it would be more like a [air quotes] \"movie.\"\n\n\"Is there a pure way to watch this? Is it ideal to watch it on VHS?\"\nWith this movie, I really don't care. It's weird. It doesn't matter to me if you project it into the toilet bowl. It makes no difference to me.\n\n\"Where did the masks come from?\"\nThese people who live out in California. Uh\u2026 tweakers? Guys who do a lot of crystal meth. But they're talented.\n\n\"Did you guys get in trouble with residents or cops or anything?\"\nNo, the thing that was most surprising is how accommodating everyone is. When I started making it we were all preparing ourselves for getting hassled or arrested or whatever. Maybe it has to do with being from the South. For the most part nobody even noticed. I think it's easier to get away with actual murder now than it ever was. People don't really pay attention. I remember one specific time it was two or three in the morning in an alleyway by where these hunchbacks that I know live. There's a group sex scene with all these trashcans and they were fucking the hell out of these cans and I heard a door open and this old woman walked out and I heard her say, \"Can I turn those porch lights on for you to make things easier?\" I said \"Yeah, go ahead,\" and she did and she just sat there and watched it. She seemed excited by it. Nowadays people are very accommodating.\n\n\"One thing that gave it continuity were the audio motifs like the cackling laughter and the little lullabies. Was that something you thought about before making it?\"\nNot really. You know that \"Three Little Devils\" song? Someone played me a recording once of a woman who had most of her larynx removed and she'd been abandoned in a well. This was probably the early 20s somewhere in North Carolina and I think they were throwing dirt on her head while she was singing, so she was getting buried alive. It was one of the most horrific sounds I'd ever heard. I don't know if you ever heard what a fox sounds like when it's in heat but it's something very awful. It just stayed with me and when were filming this it seemed like a natural place to insert it.\n\n\"The scene with you and the women, how did that come about?\" (referring to a scene in which the characters interact with prostitutes).\nThe black one was my girlfriend in high school and she looked much better back then. She let herself go. She married this guy, he worked at this place called the Doughnut Den. It's really strange to see her now because she's probably four or five times the size she used to be. I heard through the grapevine that she'd got into that Craigslist dominatrix scene. So when we were doing this, I thought she'd be a good person to call. That was her house in the movie. That was a daily occurrence at the place.\n\n\"You mentioned that you could imagine them shoving the tape into a horse's ass. What were the characters going to do with the tape they were making?\"\nI don't know. I think it's just like a record they were making. I had a friend who recorded every single minute of CNN from 1988. I don't think he ever watched it, but I think he had the whole year.\n\n\"Did you have a lot of fun doing this and if so is it going to be hard going back to making movies the way you have in the past?\nI really enjoyed it because I feel like the way conventional filmmaking is, it's stacked up against you. The process is in conflict with creating. The people involved and how long it takes, I find that it kills the excitement for me. I was always a person who wanted to be able to work as quickly as I could think and kind of act on impulse. Film could never be as immediate as this. But I still have a fondness for traditional moviemaking as well.\n\n\"What came first, wanting to shoot on VHS or the idea and the characters?\"\nI grew up very close to where I live now. When I left New York I moved back down to Nashville. When I was a kid there were a lot of alleyways where I lived. It was an intricate system of alleyways that you could basically get around anywhere if you just used these back alleyways. You don't have to see the fronts of houses. In junior high, a couple blocks from where I lived there was a retirement home that was really just someone's basement. For nineteen dollars they would house these people who you're trying to get rid of. It was a strange place. There was always a smoke machine that was on. You know that band, Herman's Hermits? They would only play that one record for them, over and over again on repeat. I guess there must have been fifteen or twenty people living there and they would always wear white nursing shoes and black turtleneck sweaters. I had a pretty hot next door neighbor and I'd see these guys staring at her late at night, doing God knows what. It stayed with me. When I moved back I would walk my dog down these alleyways and it made me remember them. And there are all these trash bins that look like humans to me. Some of them look like they'd been beaten up or abused. There were all these spotlights and it looked like a war scene. Something post-war. I just combined the two things. So I would dress up my assistant in these really crude masks like a burn victim, like someone whose face looked like a marshmallow. Like a burnt marshmallow. And he would walk around at night and he would just vandalize the neighborhood. And I would take photos with disposable cameras and stuff. I don't know why it just seemed like a natural thing to do. Once I saw the photos I thought there could be a movie. The look of it reminded me of VHS and that's how it came to be.\n\n\"How did you make a movie out of a memory.\"\nThere were certain things I wanted to see. I wrote them down on napkins and showed them to the other guys and we would wake up and do it.\n\n\"So it was just totally random?\"\nNo, because I knew there were things I wanted to see. You know sometimes in life it's good to just close your eyes and not think about it too much and just let someone take you there. If it felt right to destroy that thing or fuck that thing or set this on fire or to speak then that's what we did and I didn't think about it. What's a home movie mean? What's the story of a home movie? Sometimes I just don't think about what anything means because people can mean too much.\n\n\"Could you tell a story about Paige Spain?\"\nPaige is dead. He died. He was one of my favorite characters. He was the guy who does the exercises with his neck. I was going to see him because a friend of mine's house had just washed away in the flood. So I knocked on his door and when he answered he was wearing a pink bathrobe and he was, you know, gay. He was like, \"Oohooh, what's going on?\" I was like, \"Is Mac there?\" And he was like, \"No, but come on in.\" And I said, \"Look man, I'm\u2026 straight.\" And he goes, \"So's spaghetti till you boil it.\" So I walked into his house and he was watching nine or ten televisions simultaneously. They were all on car racing and game shows and the sound was turned down on all of them. He'd had a special bed made and he was very big into alcohol. He was a busboy or something at Holiday Inn. He was a great wit and a really amazing guy. What happened is actually a sad story. He would tell dirty jokes to the people he worked with. He worked there for thirty years. One day there was a new manager and he told a joke and the manager was some right wing zealot, a real bastard, and they fired him after thirty years. They found Paige dead. He was naked, in his house. He also collected a lot of Nazi memorabilia.\n\n\"Who was the kid in the beginning?\"\nThe kid who smashed the doll in the head? He's a well-known preacher. He hangs out at these 7-11s and sits on milk crates. He's memorized the Bible. He's another very interesting guy.\n\n\"Why are the characters murderers?\"\nMurder is just part of their vocabulary. It's what they do. They are artists of evil, not evil\u2026 destruction. They're vandals. They see vandalism and destruction as a creative act. They turn it into something beautiful. In the way that creating is artistic, they think that destroying is. So murder, it's part of their language.\n\n\"Where'd you get the baby at the end?\"\nIt's best not to talk about those things."}
{"text":"Hotel Sorrento is a reflective and thoughtful rumination on Australian culture and identity. Fabulous local filmmaker Richard Franklin - one of our finest screen scaremongers - went way, way against type adapting Hannie Rayson's well-loved play about a family forced to confront their demons and inhibitions after one of its members writes a \"fictional\" book about their lives.\n\nOne of the film's many fleeting reflections is an exploration of the word \"melancholy\" - a word that perfectly suits Hotel Sorrento's tone and pace.\n\nHorror and thriller artists often understand precisely how to solicit specific emotive responses from audiences - Hitchcock's famous allegory of cinema as a set of strings for a puppeteer summarizes exactly this notion - and Franklin does a fine job molding the film's mood into something pensive but probing and expressive, matching an unobtrusive visual structure to the film's vociferous theatrical rambles.\n\nThe (mostly female) cast are uniformly strong, and you never for a moment doubt the significance of the memories and grievances that rub over these character's lives, causing friction and conflict between them.\n\nNeither the film nor the play offer conclusive, rosy futures for their characters, but rather hints towards the redeeming powers of reconciliation.\n\ni don't feel the film does the play justice. i think the use of an Englishwoman as an Australian character is a cheap grab for international credability and completely takes away the meaning of the character in the play."}

European countries like France or Spain translate the dialogs in their own language and few theatres show the original version. This is the real FREEDOM, USA citizens do not have (though are being convinced of the contrary). On the contrary USA distributors; buy movies that are never shown because if they do people could first of all THINK something Hollywood is against and second could realize that out of the technical and production aspects USA movies are far from art; just plain formula repeated and remixed in every major title.\n\nNow, about \"LE NOUVEAU PROTOCOL\"; Raoul Craft (the outstanding Clovic Cornillac) is notified about his son dead on car accident. The first 15 or 20 minutes deals with the tragedy and family sadness without almost using dialogs.

{"text":"Search\n\nGoth-hmm city - Page 2\n\nEn route he meets an assortment of types played by Judd Hirsch, Kerry Condon, Harry Dean Stanton, Joyce Van Patten, and David Byrne as David Byrne. Place recalls in some respects the strained, condescendingly quirky Americana Exotica representation of Byrne's only directorial feature, 1986's True Stories. It, too, is one big private art project, with gratuitous \"surreal\" moments that Sorrentino's undeniable skill as a filmmaker (and Luca Bigazzi's as his inventive cinematographer) somehow render less sore-thumb inorganic than they ought to be.\n\nBut why are we watching this character, in this scenario? Both grab attention, but they never really connect. You could explain the irrelevancy and at least partial injustice in the ancient Nazi quarry's final appearance if this movie turned out to be about forgiveness rather than vengeance \u2014 but then it isn't really about either. In the end Penn's character goes through a transformation that works as a final visual grace note, but doesn't make any deeper sense given a couple seconds' thought. Was being Cheyenne just a phase our hero had to go through? For 35 years or so?\n\nThis Must Be the Place is also an inexplicable digression, all the more so for costing 28 million dollars it will never remotely make back. Penn and Sorrentino bring all their considerable dedication to it, but wandering lost between poignance and oddity, their movie never locates the \"home\" of the titular Talking Heads song. It's a deluxe but strange, pointless vacation they didn't need to go on, let alone share."}
{"text":"Imagine this: a country is run by a totalitarian government, which occasionally selects groups of teenagers to methodically kill each other. On TV. Until only one remains.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\"? No, actually it's \"Battle Royale,\" a bloody and harrowing movie that came out several years earlier, depicting an alternate Japan where the youth are forced to kill each other. It's one of those movies that is strangely fascinating and filled with social commentary, with brilliant performances from pretty much everyone concerned.\n\nA class of high-schoolers are being transported on a bus, when they are gassed to unconsciousness. When they awake, they have electronic collars around their necks. A former teacher named Kitano explains that they have been chosen for the B.R. (\"Battle Royale\") Act, wherein teenagers are forced to fight each other to the death until only one is left standing.\n\nIf you don't play, try to escape, refuse to kill or stray into a \"death zone,\" the collars explode. Each teenager is given food, water and a random item, and are set loose on a remote island.\n\nIt doesn't take long for them to fall prey to suicide, paranoia, bombs and one student's brilliant efforts to hack the system. As the teens slowly weed each other out, Shuya Nanahara and his girlfriend Noriko try to find a way out that doesn't involve death. But if they refuse to kill, then they must escape the fascist nightmare... which no one has done before.\n\n\"Battle Royale\" (both the novel and the movie) was condemned in Japan for being so violent, and having a bunch of normal high schoolers killing each other off. But \"Battle Royale\" would have been striking even if it hadn't been publicized like that -- not only is it viscerally fascinating, but it asks the question straight-out: how much will people do to survive? Who would you kill to live?\n\nIt also seems to be a story about how governments will oppress innocent people in response to the brutality of a few. However, the movie avoids any outright preaching -- instead it uncoils a tense plot, peppered with bursts of bloody violence, sexual assault and murder. There's a wild, frenetic energy to the story, and director Kinji Fukasaku unleashes it through every cold, bloodspattered scene.\n\nFun trivia: Fukasaku actually lived through something almost as cold-blooded during World War II, when he saw children having to hide from bombs under EACH OTHER. The survivors had to clear away the corpses.\n\nTatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda really give outstanding performances in this story as nice, normal, everyday kids like the ones who live down the street, but suddenly they're faced with their friends and classmates... wanting to kill them. Takeshi Kitano gives a bloodcurdlingly creepy performance as Kitano, who is nevertheless given plenty of fleshing-out (such as a fondness for one of the students).\n\nViolent, creepy and wonderfully atmospheric, \"Battle Royale\" is a brilliant cult movie that takes a look at how far people will go to stay alive. Absolutely brilliant.\n\nPreviously to viewing a copy of BR, I read the raving reviews from the other amazon customers..and you know what? I strongly agree with their 5 star ratings. this movie doesn't pull any punches when it comes to violence, but at the same time it's also a social commentary regarding violence within today's high schools, (especially in america)and the bad bridge between the generation gap.\n\nbeat takashi (brother) does a great portrayal as the sadistic teacher\/controller KITARO. BR has influences from previous american flicks like the running man, lord of the flies,escape from new york and fortress (the necklace bomb \"wedlock\")\n\nwhat's disturbing is watching those cute japanese kids get slaughtered in so many ways(shootings,hackings,slashings,poison etc.) that it almost resembles a virtual videogame. the ending i felt was anti climatic, but the flashback sequences adds much depth to the characters. too bad most americans will NEVER get to see this DVD Gem because of the contriversial content, but if ever there was a us adaptation like THE RING, director paul verhooven(robocop,starship troopers) would be my first choice and\/or maybe quinten tarantino just as long as he doesn't make a cameo appearance like he did in his previous movies.\n\nJames Gunn, director of Slither, lists this as one of his favourite movies. I can see why. It's amazing. I'm a pretty lazy guy, so watching a movie with subtitles seems like lots of work to me, but it is well worth it. So far, the only other movie I can say this about is Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nThis movie has it all. Lots of violence, a love story, and some truly funny moments. Plus, it has that Vic Romano guy from MXC!!!!\n\nJust be aware that you'll need an all-regions DVD player, as it will not play on strict North America region DVD players."}

While involved in undercover operations in the field, Plame s secret status gets leaked by the White House as deterrent and punishment. With everyone out to get her, a grueling race against time and government begins to save her exposed contacts, her family and herself\n\nI found this film to be very watchable as I quite like political thrillers. I have no idea how accurate the story is but it made for 2 hours of entertainment. Sean Penn is engaging as ever even though his character isn't always likeable. Naomi Watts is also very convincing. The strength of the film lies in watching their lives ripped apart by the accusations aimed at them. You can genuinely feel their frustration as they become victims of a government propaganda machine. If you don't like politics or you disagree with what the film is trying to say then this is best avoided. If you believe it or you just like political thrillers then it's definitely worth watching.\n\n\"Fair Game\" is not what you would call an exciting film, nor a nail biting thriller, however it is a worthy film that exposes the lies behind the second Gulf War against Iraq in the early \"Noughties\". The film is based on a true story where an important female CIA agent was exposed by White House officials after her ex diplomat husband wrote a newspaper article accusing the US government of lying about Iraq's nuclear weapons programme in order to justify the war against Saddam Hussein. The always excellent Naomi Watts (from the never to be forgotten \"Mulholland Drive\" ) plays the CIA agent while Sean Penn plays her husband. The film goes behind the scenes of CIA operations in the Middle East and reveals that there was no nuclear programme in Iraq and that the US and UK governments were aware of that , but told lies to the public nonetheless, something which I found to be unacceptable. In the US we had the Valerie Plame affair , while in the UK we saw the murder of David Kelly and \"sexed up\" dossiers to justify an unjustifiable war. Of course the public still mostly labour under the illusion that world leaders are somehow good and trustworthy and wouldn't engage in a sinister conspiracy against their own subjects.Better to adopt the maxim \"If they're at the top, they're bad\" instead in my opinion. As I said , \"Fair Game\" is not an exciting, action packed thriller; it is more like a documentary at times and it is a bit of a throwback to some 1970's political thrillers I can remember which had anti establishment themes."}

{"text":"Case Number 14250\n\nFelon (Blu-Ray)\n\nEvery purchase you make through these Amazon links supports DVD Verdict's reviewing efforts. Thank you!\n\nAll Rise...\n\nJudge Gordon Sullivan feels like he just watched three films. Would these filmmakers make up their minds?\n\nThe Charge\n\nNo Rules. No Hope. No Way Out.\n\nOpening Statement\n\nYou don't have to tell me that the American justice system (or our\n\"criminal system of justice\" as some detractors put it) is broken.\nCops are human, lawyers are crooks, and the judges seem like demi-gods. Then,\nthere's the terrible fact that money seems to buy immunity from the more\nbothersome aspects of legal proceedings, including bail money and a lawyer who\nisn't handling fifty other cases on a state salary. Then, if there's a\nconviction, it's off to prison, a place of violence which seems to bear no\nresemblance to the outside world. Should a person make it out of there, then he\nor she is still branded a criminal, making crime seem the most attractive avenue\npost-prison. So, you can see how Ric Roman Waugh could have a lot of fodder for\na film which examines the judicial system and its effect on a single person.\nAlthough he has assembled a credible cast, his film Felon prefers to\nrehash Fight Club instead of giving\nus a realistic portrayal (or sustained critique) of the prison system.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nEverything seems to be going well for Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff, Blade). His construction business is taking off,\nhe's about to be married, and life seems stable. Then, someone breaks into his\nhouse. Wade pursues the intruder out of his home and hits him with a bat,\nkilling him instantly. He's charged with murder, and his bail is set at the\nmandatory one million dollars. Unable to get together bail money and assigned a\ncourt-appointed attorney, Wade sits in county lockup waiting for pre-trial\nmotions. After a few months, the district attorney offers Wade a deal: plead\nguilty to involuntary manslaughter and do three years in prison with all his\ntime in county jail going towards the sentence. Because he doesn't want to spend\nanother year in jail waiting for a trial that he might lose (and where a\nconviction would mean a mandatory fifteen years), Wade agrees to take the plea\nand do the time. While on the bus being transported to the prison, he's witness\nto a killing by famous inmate Danny Samson. Wade has the murder weapon placed on\nhim. Now, he's in a tough predicament: if he rats on Samson he's as good as\ndead, but if he doesn't, he'll get locked up in the Security Housing Unit (SHU),\na place for violent offenders ruled by sadistic guard Jackson (Harold Perrineau,\nThe Matrix Reloaded). Wade opts\nto keep silent and is eventually placed in the SHU, where his new roommate is\nnotorious mass-murderer John Smith (Val Kilmer Heat). Wade now has to fight to stay alive\nand keep his family together against the intense pressures of prison life.\n\nThe Evidence\n\nWith its excellent cast, Felon had loads of potential. However, the\nfilm doesn't succeed because it can't quite decide what it wants to be when it\ngrows up. It starts out as a cautionary tale: look what horrible things the\njustice system can do to a regular guy. But somewhere along the way it switches\ngears into the usual exploitative \"inside prison\" movies. Much of the\nrest of the film is taken up with fights and prison politics and the cautionary\naspects are abandoned. Finally, the film ends in fairytale land, wrapping up all\nthe loose ends in a neat little bow with everyone getting their just deserts. If\nthe film had stuck with any of these styles for the entire runtime it might have\nworked. As it is the film is too preachy for the exploitation crowd, and too\nexploitative for those looking for the next Dead Man Walking.\n\nIn addition, the film can't decide what to do with the characters. Wade\nPorter is initially sympathetic, but once inside he does enough nasty stuff that\nit's hard to identify with him. Also, Lt. Jackson is an obvious sociopath, but a\nthird-act revelation attempts to give him some humanity. I can understand the\ndesire to create a \"everyone is human\" atmosphere, but in Felon\nit just ends up being confusing. I found myself not caring about anyone (except\nfor John Smith), which made the last third of the film pretty uninteresting.\n\nThere's also little to recommend this Blu-ray disc from Sony. Felon\nwas obviously shot on a fairly low budget, so this transfer shows all the flaws\nin the source material. There's excess grain, a lack of detail in dark scenes,\nas well as some wonky colors. It's not unwatchable, but the flaws are\noccasionally distracting. The audio's a bit better, with strong dialogue but an\nunremarkable score. The only extra is a short making-of featurette that features\nthe cast and crew extolling the virtues of the film.\n\nThe Rebuttal Witnesses\n\nI have to give the film credit for making Wade's predicament seem possible.\nWhen I read the back of the box I was initially very incredulous. I mean how's a\nguy who kills a home invader going to go to prison and then end up in the same\ncell as a mass murderer in prison for life? However, the movie did an excellent\njob making every step of Wade's journey into the SHU believable. The fact that\nWade killed the guy as he was running away makes his prison time credible, and\nhis silence about the bus murder makes it believable that he'd end up with John\nSmith as a roommate. Even the ridiculousness of the ending can't take away from\nthe careful job the film does of setting up Wade's horrible luck.\n\nThe acting in the film is also top-notch. I've only seen Harold Perrineau as\nlikable characters, but his turn as the sadistic guard is wholly convincing and\na little scary to watch. Stephen Dorff is also wholly believable as Wade Porter.\nHe's asked to turn from an average Joe into a brutal killer. Even though the\nfilm does a poor job of representing that change, Dorff is still convincing at\nboth ends of the spectrum. However, the lion's share of the kudos goes to Val\nKilmer. He is utterly mesmerizing as John Smith. After he moves in with Wade I\nspent the rest of the movie just waiting for his next appearance. Because Val\nKilmer was so good, it actually made me care less about Wade and his\npredicament. Instead, I wanted to see an entire film just about John Smith.\n\nClosing Statement\n\nStrong performances keep Felon from being just another clunker of a\nprison movie. The film has a hard time deciding if it was to entertain or\neducate us, which makes for confusing viewing. This Blu-ray disc isn't terribly\nstrong in the audiovisual or extras departments, so only die-hard fans of Dorff,\nKilmer, or prison flicks should seek this one out."}

{"text":"Here is a foreign production that does its bit to undergird and defend the cornerstone values of family. As movies go, it can be viewed at a couple of different levels: one, there is a compelling and authentic storyline that involves families in crisis, and, then, there is the whole matter of how one extricates oneself from such trying situations. On these two counts, the filmmaker goes deep into the human and physical landscapes to deal with how people contend with the loss of loved ones, how they stand up to injustice, how they handle their feelings, and how they effect reconciliation and healing in the long-run. To show us how complex and challenging our world is, this film explores the intricacies of multiple relationships that involve adults dealing with adults from different families, adult parents at cross-purposes with their children and, just as important, children confronting children. Though I am not a fan of nice-ending movies, in which all the loose ends are tied up at the conclusion, the delivery in this one justified it. It underscores the point that adults still lead, by way of positive example, in overcoming the alienating differences between themselves and their children."}

{"text":"About author\n\nAlisha Coelho\n\n'The Intouchables' has none of the frou-frou we've come to expect from the movies. The male leads don't look like underwear models. There's no 3D. There aren't any glitzy sets and while the movie does open with a scene of the characters driving around in a Maserati, it's not exactly a glamourous situation since the passenger who's called shotgun is paralysed from neck down.\n\nThis is not to say that the movie doesn't have you hooked from the start. Good performances set this adaption of real-life events apart and while these sort of cinematic re-tellings can turn out unbelievably sappy and unbearable (think 'The Vow'), 'The Intouchables' balances things out nicely.\n\nWhat's it about? Phillipe (Francois Cluzet) is left paralysed after a paragliding accident and is looking a caretaker. He finds a unlikely candidate in Driss (Omar Sy), who lives in a poor project housing colony and only wants Phillipe to sign his rejection slip so that he can receive unemployment benefits. Phillipe takes a liking to Driss' 'pragmatic' approach and hires him on trial for a month. Driss is initially unwilling to take up the job but is left with no option when his mother turns him out of their home. The two men become the unlikeliest of friends and then help each other resolve their personal conflicts.\n\nThe set up first seems very like that seen before in 'The Scent of A Woman', but there's no Good cop-Bad cop role play. Both Driss and Phillipe are bitter, reckless and have raging libidos. Sy is likeable enough but it is Cluzet who packs in the best performance as he expresses rage, desire, helplessness, grief and happiness using only the 52 muscles in his face.\n\nIf there's one problem we have with the movie, it is that it is dubbed in English and the nuances of conversational tones are missed. We'd have far preferred to watch it in French (with subtitles, of course) rather than hear the dialogues spoken in highly exaggerated Yank accents.\n\nWhat to do? This minor grouse apart, 'The Intouchables' is funny and endearing - a movie that will leave you with a warm feeling in your chest on a cold, wet, rainy day."}
{"text":"lucky to appear on the big screen. The story and screenplay, developed from the New York Times' bestselling book by Donald Miller, tells Miller's perspective and own experiences at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.\n\nDespite the story's basis on an interesting, best-selling novel, producing the film was a struggle. A film like this, with a message of self-discovery and resolution of major life questions, was sadly almost silenced due to budgetary issues. In 2010, Taylor had secured two investors to fund production. However, an investor bailed out at the last minute, and the film's production was temporarily shelved. It was through the surprising attempt by two fans of the book to raise the money through the website Kickstarter that Taylor's film was made possible.\n\nThe film and the story revolve around Miller, a sophomore who grew up in a small Baptist town in Texas. At Reed, his beliefs and morals are challenged, judged, and sneered upon. Considered one of the most liberal and religiously independent schools in America, Taylor did all he could to make the elements of Reed College authentic in the film. \"It was amusing to us, but it was all based on reality. I spent a lot of time at Reed College, and it's hard to believe when you watch the movie, but we actually really toned-down the Reed College experience,\" he said in a recent Entertainment article.\n\nI savored the hilariously outrageous things Taylor mentioned, especially some of the experiences of the college students and the outlandish traditions of the school. The part that makes the film so genuine and honest is that the plot and the experiences Miller goes through are based on real events. Unlike most movies, authenticity plays a key role; the viewer is not visually deceived into thinking one way or another. It sets an example of how movie-making and screenwriting ought to be in comparison to the mostly unrealistic stories of mainstream movies. In the end, movie goers belong watching Blue Like Jazz."}

{"text":"First off I'd like to note that this flick was actually legally released online through BitTorrent back in 2011 by the producers. It was a pretty ballsy move, but it helped spread word of the film through various p2p platforms. The fact that it actually turned out to be a decent flick is even more surprising to me considering it was available for free, but I digress.\n\nI normally avoid found footage films since they all seem the same to me, but I'll give a flick a watch regardless of what sub-genre it is as long as it offers a somewhat unique or creative idea behind it. My interest is especially peaked even more if it's received a lot of positive feedback from critics and viewers. That was the case with The Tunnel, which is a film that has been recommended to me by a number of fans. I finally got around to giving it a look and although the pacing is a little rough for the first half, it really pays off by the end.\n\nThe story for The Tunnel focuses on a small news crew, headed by an ambitious journalist that catches wind of a potential government cover up dealing with missing homeless people in the city's abandoned underground tunnels. After being denied official entry into the tunnels, they decide to head down there anyway, hoping that whatever they turn up with will overshadow any issues that may arise due to their unlawful entry. It's not long before the crew discovers first hand why exactly people end up missing.\n\nUnlike most found footage\/POV flicks The Tunnel actually revolves around this documentary concept to tell its story. This proves interesting since a couple survivors from the events of the footage are interviewed as the tale unfolds. This works for and against the film since it's something not really done much in the sub-genre, but it also means we know exactly who survives the ordeal. Either way, I personally liked it, because it gave it more of an authentic documentary feel.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the last 30-minutes of the film, it takes a lot of patience getting there, because we're forced to sit through a monotonous 30-minute back-story and history of events that lead up to the point of the crew entering the tunnels. Once inside the tunnels it takes another 15\/20 minutes before anything remotely interesting happens. Though, once one of the crew mysteriously disappears things kick into gear and doesn't let up until the last moments.\n\nWhat I really liked about the movie was how it remained based in reality. There weren't any cheesy CG sequences (not that I noticed anyway) that took us out of the realism it started with and the filmmakers made excellent use of the dark corridors and night vision. We're given some seriously creepy scenes, especially when we catch glimpses of what's really lurking in the tunnels. Luckily we're never fully shown what or who it is that's hunting down the crew, because many genre films fall victim to giving the audience a little more than they need to see.\n\nThe acting was also pretty decent and I wasn't nauseated by the shaky handheld camera. Ultimately, aside from the pacing in the beginning and some minor issues with events at the end, it was a surprisingly above average pic from this particular sub-genre.\nThe Tunnel offers an interesting approach towards the found footage\/POV sub-genre, but it's incredibly slow start may turn some people off. If you can stick around long enough then you'll probably find yourself engaged and creeped out at what unfolds in the last 20\/30-minutes of the film. Worth a look, but be prepared for some pacing issues early on"}
{"text":"No related\n\nIn his book-length conversation with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Alfred Hitchcock famously outlined the crucial difference between surprise and suspense. Surprise, he explained, is a bomb suddenly, unexpectedly exploding underneath a table in the middle of a mundane conversation. If you want suspense, on the other hand, simply make the audience aware of the bomb's presence beneath the table, well before it goes off, so that they're constantly thinking about it as the characters mindlessly chat. \"In the first case we have given the public 15 seconds of surprise at the moment of the explosion. In the second case we have provided them with 15 minutes of suspense. The conclusion is that whenever possible the public must be informed.\"\n\nThere's a third option to this scenario, however\u2014one that movies seldom employ, except in small doses. You can inform the characters as well. Granted, if your protagonist is James Bond or Jack Bauer or even Jeremy Renner's bomb-defusing cowboy from The Hurt Locker\u2014somebody for whom tick-tick-tick is an standard occupational hazard\u2014then you're still in suspense mode. But let a handful of ordinary Joes know that they're liable to explode at any moment, and you don't have 15 seconds of surprise or 15 minutes of suspense, but 150 minutes of pure, unadulterated terror.\n\nAt least, that's the basic idea behind Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1953 classic The Wages Of Fear, in which Yves Montand and three other roughnecks attempt to transport two truckloads of highly unstable nitroglycerin over 300 miles of mountainous terrain. Deriving endless anxiety from brawny men moving as gingerly as possible, it's a riveting anti-action movie, one of the most memorable high-concept pictures ever made in Europe. (William Friedkin directed the inevitable American remake, Sorcerer, in 1977; it's a lesser film, in my opinion, but has a deliriously grungy vibe of its own.) In this scene, our perpetually nervous heroes are using some of their dangerous cargo in an attempt to blow up a gigantic boulder blocking the road.\n\nGiven the nature of the movie, this sequence practically qualifies as frenetic, simply because someone's actually doing something, as opposed to avoiding doing something, like, say, hitting a bump in the road, or just making a sudden stop. Nonetheless, of the four characters onscreen, three are almost entirely passive throughout, watching and waiting and sweating and praying that the next instant, and the next, and the next, won't be their last. In a way, they're in the exact same position we are, albeit with an additional sense of imminent personal doom. They know something disastrous may happen at any moment, but they, like us, can do nothing but observe. (Hitchcock, who had a sort of friendly rivalry with Clouzot\u2014and who actually attempted to purchase the rights to the novel from which Wages Of Fear was adapted\u2014employed the exact same audience-identification tactic the following year in Rear Window.)\n\nPeter Van Eyck, playing the blond dude who pours the nitroglycerin down the hole (having already set in place the hammer that'll set it off), has a different task: portraying fear held barely in check by purposeful action. Rather than contorting his face (as Charles Vanel does at the end of this clip, in a different context\u2014I'll get to that), he lets his breathing do most of the work, packing audible anxiety into each exhalation. He also gets the physical details of sustained tension exactly right. Poker players know that a suddenly trembling hand is a reliable sign that a player knows the pot is his: He unconsciously tenses his muscles, awaiting the perfect card, and can't prevent a tiny spasm when they finally relax. Likewise, Van Eyck's hands are steady as he pours the nitro, but visibly betray him when he lights his cigarette after the task is finished. (I also love the bit where he starts to pick up the thermos of nitro, then stops for a moment to make the sign of the cross over the hole.)\n\nEven more memorable is the symphony of nervous tics the other three men perform during this process. Montand repeatedly, pointlessly fake-striking his lighter; Folco Lulli chewing the end of his cigar like a cow with its cud; Vanel restlessly drumming his fingers on the truck's door\u2014Clouzot really does all but fashion a brief musical number from these signifiers, giving the drivers' collective fear its own percussive rhythm. (It helps that the scene is otherwise completely silent at this point, save for ambient background noise and Van Eyck's breathing.) Their restlessness also underlines their impotence, further reminding us of our own. Empty, repetitive gestures are all you have sometimes. I recall performing similar routines\u2014squeezing my seat's cushioned armrest, usually, but tooth-grinding will do in a pinch\u2014during protracted exercises in heightened, maddening stasis like this one. Possibly even during this one.\n\nFinally, the boulder goes up in smoke, though not before it belatedly occurs to Van Eyck that it might not be the world's most brilliant idea to set off a massive explosion beside rock-strewn hills towering over two trucks loaded with nitroglycerin\u2014in uncovered beds. (Whether Lulli survives the blast, I'll leave those who haven't seen the film to discover for themselves.) In truth, that is the kind of detail someone could easily forget\u2014the fellas were careful to move the trucks some distance from the detonation, around a bend, so they'd be safe from hunks of blown-up boulder, but they weren't thinking about the gravity that put that boulder in the road in the first place. And so they, and we, get to watch a rousing game of Death Pachinko, with small rocks in place of metal balls, and jugs of concentrated kaboom in lieu of pins and holes.\n\nVanel, playing a guy so paralyzed with fear that he can't even flee the truck, arguably goes over the top in his depiction of controlled panic, shuddering as if he were in a massage chair on its highest speed, and screwing his eyes tightly shut at each prospective hit. But this is one of those cases where you do need to know what happened earlier in the movie, which spends almost its entire first half establishing this character as an utterly fearless badass of the first degree. He's comfortable handing his loaded pistol to an enemy and daring him to shoot\u2014and then slapping him hard in the face when he hesitates, and daring him again\u2014yet he goes to jelly at the sight of a small rock tumbling in his direction. That's the whole point; his exaggerated cowardice in this scene counterbalances the exaggerated machismo seen earlier. If even he can't handle the stress, this nail-biter of a film implies, what possible chance do we have?"}

When Nan Feng decides she's had enough of her family and moves out, the trio decide to room together, renting from retired Peking Opera singer Chang Yueqin (veteran Sylvia Chang, in her first film role since The Go Master back in 2006).\n\nSome of what follows is predictable; comic hijinks, gently barbed riffs on the generation gap and life lessons passed across the divide. The trio don't think much of Chang's rules and regulations, and scorn her clinging to her memories of a bygone age and the awful tragedy that stopped her life cold. So far, so obvious and yes, it turns out that much as the three of them provide the impetus to jolt Chang out of her funk, she's the stabilising influence they need to confront the issues threatening to wreck their friendship.\n\nBut for the most part, those issues are treated as real, meaningful problems. Nan Feng, Ding Bo and Soap nurse crippling flaws as much as they're full of youthful high spirits. They're not the deepest characters going, but they're fairly multi-faceted - once the story introduces Chang you realise sometimes these young people are not only rude but actually cruel, and reckless with it. They trample over the older woman's grief and drag her secrets into the light without a clue what they're doing. While their energy and enthusiasm is endearing - they're dumb kids, but their friendship is precious - they're obstinate, thoughtless and self-destructive.\n\nNor is it merely a case of each side leaning on the other to learn how fantastic they all are. The title comes from the characters' journey through the surrounding countryside, and the ruins left after the great Sichuan earthquake in 2008. The slow realisation life goes on, and that there are better things they could be doing is a crude epiphany (illustrated with actual footage from the quake) but an effective, believably human one. Though these are two very different approaches - pesky kids versus patient, artful life lessons - and Buddha Mountain feels torn between the two.\n\nLu doesn't quite seem to know whether she wants to make another brash, abrasive look at the poor clinging to China's underbelly or a glossier, more contemplative arthouse production. Nan Feng's karaoke gigs to earn some scratch would suggest the one, but the dramatic vistas around Chengdu hint at the other. The film swerves back and forth between long stretches of attention-seeking pop video jump-cutting and dreamy, symbolic montages. While the unspoken revelations hit home, the script falters over exposition, or most points where characters explain what they're thinking. Some of Chang's Big Reveals are laughably histrionic where they ought to be bitterly emotive.\n\nAnd Fan BingBing seems to have got herself a little too closely involved in the project. Listed as a producer for her second film with the director, the role of Nan Feng feels rather too much like vanity casting, and it drags the film down quite some way. Fan is arguably a very talented actress - her terrific turn in He Peng's Wheat suggested there was much more to her than shallow romcoms. But while she can do free spirit or wild child, she's not quite up to menacing or intimidating. Fan tries, and the effort she puts in is a pleasure to watch, but moments like the early scene where she cows the gang who bullied Soap elicit nervous laughter as much as anything else. It gives the impression a little distance on her part might have benefited everyone.\n\nBut when Buddha Mountain works, and it does frequently work, it's a joy. These are good people - frustratingly flawed, but genuinely anxious to reach out and help the people they care about. Each of those dreamy montages is a thing of rough, yet breathtaking beauty, and while there is a moral (there's even a character who exists solely to make sure the leads understand they've learnt something) it's a heartfelt one that never feels heavy-handed or judgemental. Despite all its flaws, this is a solid, rewarding little drama well worth anyone's time and comes recommended"}

{"text":"DVD Review: The Square\n\nWatching The Square is like watching a complicated puzzle being assembled. Each piece placed is dependent on the preceding piece, and all the pieces must be in place if the entire picture is to be seen.\n\nAn Australian neo-film-noir, The Square starts off simply. A married man's mistress (Carla, played by Claire van de Boom), also married, finds a load of loot in her attic (which her husband had squirreled away), and wants him to rob her house, take the loot, and the two of them can run away together. They decide to have her house burned down to hide the fact that the stash was stolen.\n\nToo many people become involved in the plot, a missed connection results in the death of an innocent woman, and suddenly the perfect caper becomes the worst nightmare. One death leads to another as Ray (David Roberts) tries to cover his tracks, which have been cleverly uncovered by a blackmailer who is demanding a large sum of cash. When Ray doesn't deliver, the demand gets higher.\n\nIn true film noir style, there is an odd bit of business with a dog that swims across a canal (or bay) from Carla's house to Ray's, apparently infatuated with Ray's dog (the feeling seems mutual). It's like the scene in Body Heat in which a clown in full make-up and costume drives down the street. I've always wondered, what's that about? In The Square, the dog lovers portend the fate of the human lovers.\n\nBecause Ray's actions put in motion events that lead to the old woman's death, he feels he must pay the blackmailer. One \"accidental\" death leads to another, and then another. At one point I was provoked to laughter because it didn't seem possible that so many awful things could happen to one man. The Square's tone got me past the giggles right quick"}
{"text":"Thor; PG-13, 130 minutes; Regal Seminole Square 4\n\nMost people know one thing about Thor: Thursday is named after him. The new film adaptation of the Thor story doesn't get into that, but you get to learn all about how Thor is an arrogant, impertinent, warrior prince. He's played by the Australian actor and blond beefcake Chris Hemsworth. This Thor hails from a celestial realm in which magic and science, as he explains, are one. His father Odin is the king there, and is played by Anthony Hopkins, who also does enough explaining to test a viewer's attention.\n\nIn Kenneth Branagh's Thor, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) gets banished from his kingdom via intergalactic wormhole and winds up in small town New Mexico.\n\nOdin's kingdom has an uneasy detente with the frost giants from just down the galaxy. Thor hates those jerks, and could go on fighting under-lit, incoherent, computer-generated battles with them all day. But his brother Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, is more circumspect. Something might be up with Loki, something untrustworthy.\n\nPrior to assuming its throne, Thor gets banished from his kingdom\u2014too much arrogant warmongering\u2014via intergalactic wormhole and winds up in small town New Mexico. Although it obviously lacks the other realm's production-design budgets, it's not so bad. There's a beautiful, available love interest (Natalie Portman) who just happens to be studying intergalactic wormholes. She has a Scandinavian advisor (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), who just happens to be familiar with Norse mythology. What are the odds?\n\nThor is directed by Kenneth Branagh, and penned by a veritable pantheon of writers \u2014none of whom seems to have made any particularly godly contributions. Branagh, known as a Shakesperean, always seems to strain himself when reaching down into the barrel of populism. Here he's so busy counterpointing celestial, vaguely Shakesperean intrafamily feuds with earthbound fish-out-of-water folly that both elements wind up undercooked. The net effect feels like directorial insecurity.\n\nEverywhere we look, it's a mixed bag: Kat Dennings is utterly superfluous as Portman's comic-relief sidekick, but Idris Elba is terrific as the stoic gatekeeper of the intergalactic wormholes. Thankfully Hemsworth, at least as plausible a Thor as Vincent D'Onofrio was in Adventures in Babysitting, eventually wins us over with his swaggering, just slightly campy Olde English pomposity.\n\nThor, the character, has been the property of Marvel Entertainment since the 1960s, when he became the cover boy for an odd but muscular combination of Norse mythology and comic books. So it makes sense that Thor is the epitome of commercial filmmaking: It's less a film than a commercial for its own sequel, for the Avengers movie next year and for the many multiplatform entertainment properties on offer from the Marvel machine. Let's call it a success, for isn't it the first rule of the franchise propagator to leave us wanting more five"}
{"text":"Movie Review: Rambo - Page 2\n\nThis appreciation of death is one of the film's dominant themes. When the medical missionaries realize how difficult it is to make a dent in something as unruly and complex as the Burmese civil war, their outlook changes from sacrifice to survival. In the process, the missionaries lose their innocence, purity, and sanity. Meanwhile, the only thing they gain is a traumatic experience. What will those who survive report to their church when they return? Perhaps, the description of running through a corpse-laden terrain as gunfire takes the life of the person running beside you?\n\nWith this depiction in mind, how is it that the good guys never get pumped full of friendly fire as thousands of bullets rip through the air? With Rambo, fans must look beyond the unlikely, the cheap white text used on the subtitles and credits, and the fact that Jerry Goldsmith (composer) and Richard Crenna (Col. Sam Trautman) are not involved due to cancer. What's most important is that Stallone traverses generations and represents an accurate representation of what John would be like two decades after Afghanistan.\n\nThere is no question that Stallone can still act, write, and direct; he has proved all three most recently with Rocky Balboa and Rambo. The question is however: can Stallone act, write, or direct a character that he hasn't previously played? Not including Stallone's 1983 effort Staying Alive, the answer will come next year in his chronicle of the life and death of Edgar Allan Poe. Keep your eyes peeled and your mind open"}

This a lovely piece of movie suited for anytime, any place.\n\nThis felt oddly downbeat at first, almost melodramatic, and hard to acclimatise to, but after a while I settled to it and it just gets better and better. It becomes a really melancholic feeling yakuza film that moves in between cycles of contemplatative solemnity and outbursts of violence, moving towards a conclusion that is both of those things.\n\nIts a pretty outstanding film, with a really clear and impressive mood and sense of feeling heightened by the sparing use of brilliantly fitted music, that grows and grows and becomes more penetrating and involving as it progresses.

{"text":"We Bought a Zoo\n\nIn \"We Bought a Zoo,\" Matt Damon plays Benjamin Mee, a widower who's been alone with his kids for six months when he decides to upend their lives and buy a broken-down zoo in Southern California. Based on the real-life Mee's actual memoir, \"We Bought a Zoo\" contains all the ingredients of a maudlin, treacly weeper (\"Dozens of Marleys and Three Mees\").\n\nHappily, writer-director Cameron Crowe keeps the most mawkish manipulations to a minimum in a movie that moves through its requisite stages - grief, acceptance, zany sights gags and healing - with smooth, entertaining efficiency. You want the tough, spiky version of virtually the same story, see \"The Descendants.\" You want sunshine and uplift, see \"We Bought a Zoo.\"\n\nThe title, by the way, is spoken twice by Mee's 7-year-old daughter, Rosie, played by the beguiling Maggie Elizabeth Jones, whose scene-stealing cuteness proves to be one of the most likable things in a movie that's all about being liked.\n\nLess adorable but even funnier is Thomas Haden Church as Benjamin's skeptical brother, Duncan, who speaks in a surfer's drawl and carries a series of mordant zingers in his quiver to defend against incoming earnestness. When he meets the zoo's comely manager, Kelly (a miscast but sporting Scarlett Johansson), he advises Benjamin to \"dump the animals and keep Kelly. That's true joy.\"\n\nKelly is part of a team of eccentric zoo staffers that the Mees inherit when they buy the sweetly decrepit zoo, which animal lovers will be happy to hear isn't the jaillike fortress they avoid but a delightfully ramshackle, rambling affair of low fences and open grassy spaces. Granted, the grizzly bear is suffering a bout of depression, and an elderly tiger is facing end-of-life issues, but the animals are humanely treated and can be counted on to put on dazzling displays, especially when they join in a gutteral chorus once the sun sets.\n\nWhile Benjamin guts his savings to keep the zoo going until its official summer-season opening, \"We Bought a Zoo\" pivots around that deadline, his fractured relationship with Dylan and the simmering attraction between Benjamin and Kelly.\n\nCrowe, who made the blandly slick comedies \"Jerry Maguire\" and \"Almost Famous,\" knows how to keep those balls aloft without too much strain, even if he resorts too often to nostalgic music cues to inject emotion into a scene. Still, the low-key appeal of \"We Bought a Zoo\" is nearly impossible to resist, not just because it provides the minimal daily requirement of hugs and closure, but because it's such an apt wish fulfillment fantasy when for many viewers Plan B isn't just a dream but a necessity.\n\n\"We Bought a Zoo\" provides a welcome seasonal dash of wholesomeness and humor (although parents may need to explain a few naughty word-definitions here and there), but it's also a heartening celebration of second acts, even at their most unwelcome"}

It sounds preposterous to sustain for the duration of a feature-length film, you say? Think again. \"Phone Booth\" may be imperfect, its biggest flaws being two unsympathetic main characters and a contrived and far-fetched plot, but that doesn't stop the audience from having a heck of a good time most of the way. It's quite an accomplishment, really, when you consider that Farrell is on screen almost 100% of the time and Sutherland is a disembodied voice.\n\nWe're told at the beginning of the movie that despite practically everyone in the greater New York metropolitan area owning a telephone, approximately 4,500,000 people still use phone booths on a regular basis. One of these people is publicist Stu Shepard, a married man who daily uses the last remaining old-fashioned phone booth in the city for calls to his girlfriend, Pam (Katie Holmes). He calls at same time every day from a place he feels his wife (Radha Mitchell) will never find evidence on the phone bills. It's a booth in busy, downtown Manhattan, about to be retired and replaced by a ubiquitous telephone kiosk. But today it's all Stu's, his privacy secure. That is, until a sniper targets him for his personal amusement.\n\nHigh above the phone booth, hidden in one of a thousand windows, is a madman with a high-powered rifle and a telescopic lens, a man who knows Stu's every move and has rigged up the booth with all manner of gizmos to get and keep Stu's attention. He's never met Stu, but he's researched him and hates what he represents: a fast-talking schemer, a conceited ladies' man, and an unfaithful husband. It's enough for the sniper to call Stu at the booth and then keep him there with the promise of a bullet through his head if he dares leave. If Stu hangs up or steps out of the booth, it's good-bye, Stu. Those few square feet suddenly become for the duration of the movie Stu's whole world, his whole life.\n\nDoes the killer mean what he says? \"Stu,\" the sniper tells him, \"I never kid.\" And then he blows away a pimp who's come to claim the phone booth for one of his girls. The police arrive, finding Stu in the booth and the dead body outside, and assume Stu is a murderer.\n\nThat's the whole situation in a nutshell, set up in the first few minutes of the picture and continuing for the remainder of the film. The sniper is a self-appointed vigilante who finds Stu guilty of \"inhumanity\" to his fellow man. Forest Whitaker plays a policeman, Captain Ramey, who has to figure out what's going on and what to do. Before long, Stu's become famous, because not only does half the NYC blue show up but so do the television cameras. Yet Stu can't explain why he won't leave the booth or what's happening to him, lest the unknown, unseen sniper put a bullet through him.\n\nThe situation is tense, scary, and gripping throughout, even if the whole affair is too incredible to believe. It's to the film's credit, however, that it doesn't give one enough time to consider the logic until it's over, by which time you don't care because it's been so entertaining.\n\nI did have a few quibbles, though, that nagged me during and after the picture. Most important, was it really necessary to make both leads so repellant? It goes without saying that the sniper is a lunatic, a serial killer who's done this kind of thing before; we're not supposed to have any heart for him. He is virtually never seen, and Sutherland projects in his voice exactly the right degree of slimy menace to make him totally repulsive. Indeed, it is Sutherland who practically steals the show, he's so mesmerizing, a little like the old-time \"Shadow.\"\n\nBut Farrell's character is almost equally offensive. Stu is the kind of guy who gives PR a bad name: a lying, cheating, conniving, self-centered young jerk without a care in the world for anybody but himself. Frankly, for most of the picture, we don't feel enough for him to care whether he lives or dies. Indeed, I'd be willing to bet that a lot of folks in the audience would like to see him blown away regardless. Worse, there's a reason for Stu's being such a total creep, and when it's revealed, it's almost as bad as our not knowing.\n\nI also had issues with the movie's ending; with the police captain's extraneous problems with a department negotiator; with the director's overreliance on split screens and multi-angles; and with the fact that the plot runs out of steam about two-thirds of the way through, making the film probably too long even for its brief eighty-one minutes. Still, it's a good time while it lasts.\n\nThe story is the brainchild of writer Larry Cohen, hitherto known for B-movie and schlock horror flicks like \"Maniac Cop\" and \"It's Alive.\" With \"Phone Booth,\" however, Cohen is right on target and hits the mark, if you'll excuse the expression. It's still B-movie material, mind you, but it's good B-movie material, elevating the substance of this film well beyond anything we have had any right to expect from the genre.\n\nVideo: As usual, Fox delivers a clean, crisp DVD picture, projected in both an anamorphic widescreen that measures an approximately 2.17:1 ratio across a normal television and a pan-and-scan, standard format. The P&S on side two is not entirely objectionable, however, as it restores information at the bottom of the screen while cutting off the edges. Even movies shot specifically for release in widescreen formats like Panavision are most often photographed in larger negative sizes in order to ensure that things like microphones, booms, and other hanging objects in a frame can later be cut out. Since \"Phone Booth\" was released to theaters in something like 2.35:1, the widescreen on the disc will be the preferred viewing for movie purists.\n\nAs to the picture quality, understandably, there's not a lot of color in the movie; I mean, the guy's in a phone booth, after all. But the transfer is as sharply defined and the hues as clearly presented as I would imagine they looked in a movie house, and there is virtually no grain and there are no moir\u00e9 effects or other digital transfer artifacts of mention.\n\nAudio: The Dolby Digital 5.1 sonics are at least half the fun. In a movie that depends upon our sense of hearing as much as our sense of seeing, the audio reproduction does its part admirably. The surround speakers are used to create an all-encompassing environment, and the front speakers erupt with violent outbreaks of dynamics and bass. What's more, it's satisfying to hear Sutherland's unflappable speech patterns projected not just from the center channel but from above and beyond the center channel, and it's good to hear other voices actually moving across the screen along with their characters. The movie provides an enthralling aural experience all by itself.\n\nExtras: Not a lot going on here. Besides offering the film in standard and widescreen formats, the only other bonus item of note the Fox people provide is an audio commentary with director Schumacher. Beyond that, there are twenty-eight scene selections and theatrical trailers for this film and something called \"Garage Days.\" English, French, and Spanish are the spoken language options, with English and Spanish for subtitles\n\nParting Thoughts: \"Phone Booth\" is, without a doubt, little more than an amusement-park joy ride, but what an enjoyable ride it is! With the sure hand of a capable director and the exceptionally fine performances of its three principal actors, the film is one of the edgiest, most exciting dramas to come along in a while.

{"text":"incoln (12A)\n\nIs it just a coincidence that the director's film about Lincoln hits the screen in the week of Obama's presidential inauguration\n\nCoincidence or not - Spielberg's sanctimonious portrayal of Lincoln being released almost simultaneously with the second inauguration of Barack Obama's presidency?\n\nOr is it simply a mighty fine time to give Old Glory a bit of spit and polish and emphasise the statutes of the Constitution the US has tarnished with its war on the world?\n\nWritten by Tony Kushner from a biography by Doris Kearns, Lincoln portrays all the double-dealing necessary to get the 13th Amendment outlawing slavery on the statute books before the civil war ended.\n\nThe prologue sums this up, with the improbable image of two black soldiers talking to camera in response to Lincoln's questioning about their role during the war and their hopes for the future.\n\nHaving said they enjoyed killing slave masters, they echo the same sentiments that would be articulated in Martin Luther King's famous dream and even hint at the possibility of a black president.\n\nThey walk away reciting the Gettysburg address. In reality, black soldiers weren't allowed to bear arms until the shortage of white recruits, as was recalled in Edward Zwicks's 1989 film Glory.\n\nThe question is asked by Lincoln as though he were Shakespeare's Henry V mixing with his troops before battle, only for the centre of the struggle to be shifted almost exclusively to Washington.\n\nIt's close to a one-man-show, with the great contortionist Daniel Day Lewis proving perfect as the tall, crook-backed politician who proved a master of the Machiavellian arts.\n\nAmong what seems to be a cast of thousands, Spielberg concentrates on the major players who vied for Lincoln's attention - his \"mad wife\" Mary (Sally Field), their sons and significant protagonists of the era.\n\nThey include his spin-master William H Seward (David Strathairn) who had to promote the ideals of staunch abolitionists like Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) despite degrees of difference in the anti-slavery camp.\n\nIn the finale the principal characters read aloud the words of the 13th Amendment, as though to impress it on the popular psyche - like learning by rote.\n\nNot that it ends there. As with Spielberg's Schindler's List, the epilogue is almost an advert for Israel as Abe tells Mary he would like to walk in Jerusalem before he dies.\n\nAt that moment, we witness not just principles being shaped by the demands of real-politik but Spielberg recruiting the most iconic US president in his personal commitment to zionism."}

{"text":"Country of origin\n\nLinks\n\nThe Impossible Preview\n\nRegular moviegoers, the weekend warriors, are repeatedly assaulted with images of disaster, often taking on a global reach of apocalyptic doom. One becomes desensitized to such grand illusions after a while, regarding the end of the world as a time when the Capitol Records building eats it, the Eiffel Tower takes a tumble, and Red Square is reduced to rubble. \"The Impossible\" is a harrowing reminder of real-world nightmares, with the film dramatizing the devastation and anguish that followed the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster in a frightfully vivid manner, taking a refreshingly blunt perspective on the challenges of survival and the tenacity of the human spirit. Although it sounds like a downer, \"The Impossible\" is actually emotionally satisfying and educational in a way, with director Juan Antonio Bayona doing a superb job keeping the details vital and the characters admirably resolute.\n\nTaking a much needed Christmas vacation to Thailand, Henry (Ewan McGregor), Maria (Naomi Watts), and kids Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast), have settled in for a relaxing stay on the beach, looking to celebrate the holiday without the interference of work. During a morning of pool play, the family is split up when a massive tsunami hits the coast, decimating the resort, with Maria and Lucas immediately fighting surging waters while the mother is torn to shreds by uprooted trees and violent underwater debris. Struggling to locate safety, Lucas comes to understand his role as protector, guiding Maria to helpful locals and eventually into a hospital where her severe wounds keep her on the brink of death. After the tsunami, Henry has managed to protect Thomas and Simon, setting out to locate his wife and child as rescue efforts begin to take shape. Slowly accepting the gargantuan loss of life around him, Henry struggles to sustain hope as he marches across the land with other stunned folk hunting for their loved ones.\n\n\"The Impossible,\" scripted by Sergio G. Sanchez, is based on a true story, with the featured family switched from Spaniards to Brits, despite the picture being a Spanish production. Nevertheless, nationality isn't the primary concern here, only the authenticity of the struggle, and Sanchez and Bayona have made sure the audience feels every last ounce of concern emerging from these characters as they're faced with the fight of their lives, overwhelmed by a terrifying act of nature.\n\nI understand that \"The Impossible\" sounds like a frightening picture, immediately repelling those who seek out lighter diversions when it comes to multiplex selections. However, the feature, while suffocating at times, isn't obsessed with the particulars of death and destruction. Instead, the production keeps close to moments of survival and connection, with the disaster reinforcing the bonds of family as the participants are pushed to their physical and psychological limit. Bayona takes care to reinforce moments of hope, however small they may be, keeping the viewing experience straightforward with discoveries and setbacks, without much lost family near-miss manipulation that's common to the genre. \"The Impossible\" is approachable, taking time to process the significance of the event and how it impacts the characters as they strive to reclaim the family unit in the midst of chaos. There's a human element to the film that's masterfully rendered, keeping \"The Impossible\" from becoming just another demo reel of visual effects and melodramatic acting.\n\nWhile heart is in abundant supply during \"The Impossible,\" there's also a tsunami to dramatize, providing the film with its most distressing moments of bodily trauma and discouragement. It's not an explicit, grand CGI event, but a series of visual body blows intended to recreate the agony of treading violent water and the desperate reach for higher ground. The moment of collision is chilling, yet deeper wounds come into play later in the picture, when the family individually considers the enormity of their dilemma, with Lucas and Maria accepting the death of Henry and the boys, while witnessing a secondary wave of suffering hit their hospital, observing other panicked souls hunting for survivor information. There's also an abyssal feeling of guilt and shock slowly swallowing Henry during his trek, crippling the man as hope runs out.\n\nActing in \"The Impossible\" is expectedly passionate and defenseless, but Bayona deserves special credit for managing his younger actors, guiding them to natural performances, with young Hooper an especially promising standout in a complex role. Watts and McGregor provide a haunting sense of panic and grief, but more impressive is how well they sell the make-up work, which is nothing short of outstanding. With gruesome wounds and hospital bed frailty, the bodily destruction is scarily realistic, handing the cast a proper motivation to ease the demands of communicating ungodly pain.\n\n\"The Impossible\" finds a satisfying conclusion, though one that's marked by a somber tone of devastation, supplying a poignant look at the desperate atmosphere surrounding the tsunami. Still, there's light piercing through the gloom and doom, keeping the viewing experience approachable and, at times, exceptionally emotional."}

They negotiate, and being the shrewd businessman that he is, Waltz acquires our title character, Jamie Foxx's Django. (\"The D is silent,\" he says later in the trailer.) The plot runs like this: Waltz and Foxx go on a bloody mission to kill the Brittle Brothers, who Foxx hates because they captured and sold his wife to Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candle. If they kill all the Brittle Brothers, then Waltz will help Foxx rescue his wife and grant them their freedom.\n\nIt's the first trailer so we only get a brief plot primer, some good zingers, and a whole lot of blood splattering on some pretty flowers.

{"text":"A successful ad executive actually stole the identity of a dead man. A war hero is actually a terrorist. At first blush, FX's The Americans, about two Soviet spies undercover as a Virginia couple in 1981, seems to share elements of each of these antihero shows, along with less celebrated series like The Riches. But maybe the greatest success of the show so far is that, after three increasingly strong episodes, it has a voice and a (secret) identity of its own. One thing that distinguishes this Cold War story from its predecessors is that there are two protagonists perpetuating a fiction, against another country, against their neighbors, against their own children\u2013even, to an extent, against each other. So as much as The Americans is the thriller you'd expect\u2013tense, well-paced and laced with well-curated period detail\u2013it's also an intriguing study of marriage as partnership. Reversing the common order of things, The Americans asks whether marital routine can develop into actual love. Certainly the relationship of Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) is more complicated than that of the average husband and wife who happen to be co-workers. The two were paired as young KGB agents in the 1960s, taught immaculate English (and hand-to-hand combat) and sent to the U.S. to live as husband and wife. They've put down roots, blended in to the suburbs and are raising two very American children. (When their son describes a school project about the moon landing, Elizabeth answers defensively, \"You know, the moon isn't everything.

{"text":"No related\n\nEvery day, Watch This offers staff recommendations inspired by a new movie coming out that week. This week: The Last Stand, the first American film by gifted Korean director Kim Ji-woon (I Saw The Devil, A Tale Of Two Sisters), has us thinking about foreign directors working in America for the first time.\n\nTaking Off (1971) Milos Forman was a well-established New Wave director in his native Czechoslovakia before political unrest and the Soviet invasion of 1968 drove him to America. At home, he was a New Wave pioneer with rawly observational films like Loves Of A Blonde and The Firemen's Ball; in America, he earned acclaim and Best Director Oscars for high-profile studio fare like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus. But the transition point between the two eras was his first English-language film, Taking Off, a Universal Pictures-backed movie that nonetheless feels like a scrappy indie, heavily inflected by his New Wave past.\n\nBuck Henry and Lynn Carlin star as a self-absorbed square couple whose teenage daughter (Linnea Heacock) runs away from home. Henry and Carlin fight, fuss, and make uptight fools of themselves, with Carlin bullying Henry into taking the search to the streets, and Henry using the opportunity to get falling-down drunk. When Heacock does eventually return, it's to Henry singing naked atop a table, amid a drunken game of strip cards with another couple. In Taking Off's view, the counterculture is about the younger generation banding together to fumble their way through an exploration of something deep, true, and sometimes emotionally painful. Forman observes it mostly from a respectful distance, capturing cuts from a Tina Turner concert and a musical audition (which features, among other things, extended performances from Carly Simon and a young Kathy Bates) without choreographing or framing them. While the young people express themselves through art, and Heacock mostly stays silent and takes it all in simply and uncritically, the adults bray out their windy opinions and self-serving nonsense, and generally act more immature than their kids.\n\nThe film is a collection of often awkward, uncomfortable but bitterly funny vignettes, none more memorable than the comic sequence where character actor Vincent Schiavelli, in his film debut, assiduously leads a group of parents with missing kids through their first pot-smoking experience. Ostensibly, it's a field trip to their kids' world, so they can understand what their offspring are up to. But Schiavelli's serious, scholarly explanation of bogarting and roaches, and the parents' college-course sedulousness and eventual goofy stabs at self-expression, turns the whole thing hilarious and illustrates why the generation gap is uncrossable. The kids are trying to find something real they can own. The adults are trying to understand it by co-opting it. But by definition, what the kids want most is a place their fumbling parents can't comprehend, can't reach, and can't ruin.\n\nAvailability: Taking Off isn't available for home viewing in America, reportedly due to music-rights issues, but it's available in its entirety on YouTube."}

He fits into a character undoubtly but meek in appearance. Who is really a larger than life character, Who always has a job or scheme going down while appearing slow.

Who believes he has everything under control and is smart enough to know every angle. As the film progresses you can feel the noose tighten on all the characters and the narrative until it ends, not with a scream but with a whimper.\n\nThe ending is a sucker punch to the gut. You think you know everything there is to know and that you need to until the final scene truly reveals all. You think that all this will be some sort of damage, But you witness as life just goes on like nothing really happened.\n\nThe reason to enjoy the film is it is stylish with no style that doesn't call attention to itself. This is truly a film of it's time as the studios don't make films like this anymore. If it was made today it would be more flashy and sensationalistic. It would make the characters have a deep core of goodness. This film staying low-key and making no difference between the roles assigned as good or bad both are corrupt in some way.

Almost singlehandedly, against overwhelming odds and with little regard for her own well-being, Margaret reunited thousands of families, brought authorities to account and worldwide attention to an extraordinary miscarriage of justice. She discovered a secret that the British government had kept hidden for years: one hundred and thirty thousand children in care had been sent abroad to commonwealth countries, mainly Australia. Children as young as four had been told that their parents were dead, and been sent to children's homes on the other side of the world. Many were subjected to appalling abuse. They were promised oranges and sunshine, they got hard labour and life in institutions.\n\nWhat an absolutely harrowing and moving film. It's hard to believe that the film is based on true events, events that only took place a few decades ago....Wonderfully shot with strong performances from the entire castI like Emily Watson a lot. I had never heard of this movie before, and I chose to watch it just because Emily was in it.\n\nIt is a tale of British children being shipped off to Australia after the WW II. The deportations happened without the consent of the parents, and the children naturally had no say in events.

She starts to look into things, and posing questions that many people would rather forgetThis is a politically motivated movie based on a true incident. Unfortunately, I just didn't find the story or the political issue all that interesting (apparently, some British children were given up for adoption in the 50's and shipped to orphanages is Australia without their parents knowledge). Emily Watson is terrific but her performance is not enough to recommend this movie."}
{"text":"User Reviews\n\nThe main storyline is that there are various natural disasters happening all over Korea (and the world I presume) and people are trying to collect insurance monies by claiming their loved ones were killed.\n\nHow are they collecting money you ask? Well, insurance companies are ponying up as the structures built to withstand disasters aren't holding up.\n\nThe story takes place in a morgue with a husband and wife (claiming the dead woman is their daughter), a government official (overseeing the process of identification), a reporter and the forensics doctor. While going through the motions, the forensics doctor recognizes the deceased as his own daughter who disappeared seven years prior. Thus begins a battle of sorts between the supposed parents and the supposed father.\n\nThis is a dialogue driven piece with some well placed cuts to people injured and killed in natural disasters as well as imagery of natural disasters themselves.

{"text":"Rate this movie:\n\nYou must sign-in first.\n\nCurrent Rating 8.92\/10 | 37 Votes\n\nEven World War II could not sway corporate greed, the Catholic menace and a driven heart. It's a beautiful thing when the romance in a movie equally sways the emotions of men and women and Australia does just that.\n\nLady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) decides to leave England and go to Australia to meet with her husband about their cattle ranch, Far Away Downs. Her husband introduces her to Drover (Hugh Jackman), a cattle drover. On her ranch, she meets Nullah (Brandon Walters), a mixed race aboriginal child and his mother Daisy (Ursula Yovich). Australian cattle baron King Carney is doing everything he can to have a cattle monopoly.\n\nThe first half an hour of the movie is a cheeky World War II era action story beginning. Australia moves like a jive, lots of steps at a quick pace, playfully entertaining the audience with its speed and precision. It is sprinkled with unexpected moments of levity. Occasionally I worried it would go over the top, but Baz Luhrmann, the director, restrained it from becoming a slapstick comedy.\n\nThe light attitude of the first few minutes of Australia only lead the audience by the nose into a false sense of security. The story begins to get darker, the subject matter more intense, and starts to resonate more loudly. Anger, fear and frustration become real emotions the audience feels, even though they don't understand what's going on.\n\nOne thing that's easy to understand is the romantic chemistry in Australia. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman get within three frames of each other, the audience can feel the heat. Their first kiss left me feeling like I had been kissed as deeply and passionately as Ashley. There is a scene that made all the women in the audience sit against the back of their seats with their mouths open, aghast at the beauty of Hugh Jackman.\n\nBefore the men refuse to see this on \"chick flick\" grounds, don't worry. Men will have no problem enjoying the romance for men: cattle drives and war. Heck, there is even a bit of hunting, horseback riding and bar fighting.\n\nAustralia oozes visual style and smears it across the audience like warm lotion. The use of warm and cool lighting to express mood makes the audience sink deeply into the story. Almost every scene in Australia is enhanced by the careful attention to the way it looks. There are the occasional mishaps with the visual effects, especially the dead cow stand-in but they don't take away from the overall splendor of Australia.\n\nI knew nothing about Australia's \"Stolen Generations.\" This nauseating chapter in Australian history, explained in detail in Australia, armed me with one more bullet in my arsenal against the Catholic Church. I always appreciate a movie that shows these religious groups for what they are: a criminal organization with no regard for the dignity of their flock, and they will do whatever the good people near them will allow them to get away with. This was not all the church's doing but they are a willing participant in disgusting acts of racial cleansing. Not a shocker to anyone who knows anything about religion's footprint on the world.\n\nAustralia tempts the heart to take a journey of pain and joy but rewards it with an experience that lasts far beyond the movie's end."}
{"text":"At first glance, Fast Company seems like a predictable 1970s gearhead film of\nno special merit, obviously a film which spent more time on drive-in screens than in indoor\ntheaters, but it has several interesting facets which merit some discussion.\n\nFirst, it was directed by none other than the eccentric Canadian auteur David\nCronenberg, although you'd never know it. None of his usual bizarre obsessions make an appearance. It\nis a straightforward movie about the drag racing circuit in Canada and the\nPacific Northwest. While it's not quite in Hal Needham's goofy good-ol'-boy\nterritory, it's so mainstream that if someone told you it was directed by a\nyoung Ron Howard, you'd shrug your shoulders and accept that fact without\nsuspicion. Why did one of our weirdest sci-fi\/horror directors make this\nrealistic, grounded film about such a pedestrian subject? Apparently Cronenberg\nloves fast cars and considered this a labor of love. Rumor has it that he still\nhas a nostalgic fondness for this rarely-seen film.\n\nSecond, the film was the last ever made by the former Playboy Playmate of the\nYear, Claudia Jennings, who was kind of a staple feature of drive-in flicks in\nthe seventies. Not long after making this film, she fell asleep at the wheel of\nher VW convertible and died in a fatal car crash. That was a while back as I\nwrite this in 2010. If she were still alive, she would now be 60, but she never\neven saw the sun rise on her 30th birthday. Memento mori.\n\nThird, there is some good old-fashioned seventies-style nudity, and the\nquality of the Blu-Ray is excellent. The film was obviously shot well and the original print\nwas competently mastered. As I write this\nmany fine films have not yet come to Blu-Ray, but this obscure exploitation film\nhas. Heaven knows why that is true because there can't be that much demand for\nit. Hell, most people don't even know it exists.

It seems to me like its overwhelming welcome in the U.S. is partially driven by the fact that it's a film from a region of the world from which we don't often get to see people telling their own stories. (They tell them; we just don't listen.) The dialogue is sparse yet acute, and the cinematography is rich; however, I didn't feel all that I wanted from some of the supporting characters. The film reminded me of the flurry of early-90s Boyz-in-the-Hood flicks, in which a young tough seeks or is led to some sort of redemption or point of no return. While I could swallow where the story went, I just wasn't sucked in all the way. I wanted more of of the heart of S. Africa, not just an image of a township juxtaposed against the twinkling lights of Jo'burg. The speeches of the character named Boston were in the vein of what I wanted, but I wanted to know some of the other characters a little deeper even if they weren't the crux of the story. Overall, the film just wasn't meaty enough in its stage-theatre like simplicity. The DVD includes a short, 20-min. film by director Gavin Hood entitled The Storekeeper; it's worth watching but be forewarned that the outcome is pretty harsh. It took the wind out of my happiness sails."}
{"text":"Follow Us On\n\nQuestion of the Day\n\n\"Jack Reacher\" is a throwback action thriller \u2014 taut and muscular, gruff and cool. Based on Lee Child's 2005 novel, \"One Shot,\" it offers viewers familiar but forgotten action pleasures: directorial competence, a screenplay with just enough wit, an honest-to-goodness movie star and supporting actors who hold their own.\n\nIndeed, in an age when brooding teen heroes dominate the big screen, it's a movie that's enjoyable as much for what it's not as for what it is: cynical but not grim, clever but not ironic, fast-paced but not in your face. It's not a revelation, but a reminder \u2014 sometimes the old formulas work just as well as the new ones.\n\nMake no mistake: This is formula through and through. But it's particularly well-executed formula, from the swift and shocking crowd shooting that opens the film to a cramped bathroom beat-down that's probably the funniest bit of action shenanigans I've seen all year. The story, about a supposedly open-and-shut case involving a mentally disturbed sniper who goes on a seemingly random killing spree, is predictably unpredictable in its well-timed twists and turns.\n\nBut what really makes it work is that writer-director Christopher McQuarrie never lets the familiar elements feel too familiar: He brings a weird, brutal creativity to the movie's fisticuffs, and gives them an intimacy that too many recent grand-scale action pictures lack. Nor does he rely heavily on computer-generated effects, which gives his larger action scenes a tough, tactile feel: A superbly staged downtown car chase turns into a symphony of rumbling pistons and squealing tires. These are real cars, and real stakes.\n\nAt the heart of it all is Tom Cruise as Reacher, the title character and the hero of more than a dozen Lee Child novels. Reacher is a classic thriller-series protagonist: a terse ex-military investigator who lives entirely off the grid; he can't be tracked, or found, unless he allows it. You don't know Jack, unless he wants you to.\n\nOf course, the person who wants to be seen and known here is Mr. Cruise. The actor has a penchant for blank-slate action heroes: Think of Ethan Hunt, the hero of the \"Mission: Impossible\" series. What do we actually know about him? Not much, except what Mr. Cruise puts on screen. The same goes for Reacher. These roles are designed as stripped-down star vehicles: You don't see the character, only the actor. The movie is called \"Jack Reacher.\" It could have just as easily been called \"Tom Cruise.\"\n\nWhether Mr. Cruise is a particularly good actor doesn't matter much here. He's an effective presence, which is what the role requires. In supporting roles, Richard Jenkins, David Oyelowo, Robert Duvall and Werner Herzog all perform admirably as Reacher's friends and foils. Mr. Duvall, in particular, offers a reminder of why he's still working after all these years. Like the rest of the movie, he's a little bit old-fashioned, but he still gets the job done."}
{"text":"The Imposter\n\nUnless otherwise noted, films begin on Friday and run through the next Thursday.\n\nThe title of this documentary from director Bart Layton is one big spoiler: the young man who claimed to be Nicholas Barclay, who had disappeared from his San Antonio home in 1994\u2026 is actually Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin, a French con man who fooled the FBI, the European authorities, and the still-grieving Barclay family for what seems an impossibly long time. Even if we're not familiar with the deception from David Grann's article in The New Yorker\u2014and if the film had a different, non-spoiler title\u2014the self-proclaimed Nicholas Barclay who suddenly appears in Spain just seems too improbable. How does a blonde, blue-eyed adolescent from Texas turn into a dark-haired, brown-eyed youth with a French accent in just four years (and at 23, was noticeably older than the high school age boy he should have been)? Granted, Bourdin is a smooth operator who spun some fantastic yarns about being abducted, raped, and tortured by military sadists\u2014but the nagging question persists: how could the Barclays have believed this was their son? Is the desire to believe, to hold on so tenaciously to the slim possibility that Nicholas could be alive, so powerful that it warped their basic judgment? That's one of the major themes of Layton's provocative, chilling film, which expertly combines archival footage, interviews with the real-life subjects, and skillful re-enactments with actors saying what their counterparts reportedly said to one another. Another theme is how Bourdin could justify what he did: he tells of a childhood of abuse and racist bullying (he claims to be part-Arab), but it's hard to take anything he says at face value\u2014still, there has to be a reason buried somewhere beneath the lies. Layton wisely lets all the participants in the drama offer their perspectives on what happened, and why they did what they did\u2014including the detectives and law enforcement officials who worked on the case. It's easy at first to dismiss Bourdin as a heartless villain (his cocky grin will make viewers want to smack him), the Barclays as sad, rather pathetic dupes, and the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic as bumblers\u2014but like all great documentaries, The Imposter doesn't linger on surface appearances, but burrows deeper into the heart of the story, making us understand how and why this ruse worked. Some fine movies have utilized the idea of a \"changeling\" taking the place of a lost loved one\u2014The Return of Martin Guerre and its American remake, Sommersby, come to mind\u2014but these fictional films tend to simplify the psychology, making it easy to understand why the deceived parties actually protect their imposters. Layton's film is more complex but no less engaging and even suspenseful, although we know from the start that the happy reunion is a sham. Indeed, knowing what we know gives the re-created scenes of \"Nicholas\" worming his way into his family's affection (as well as the sympathy of neighbors and classmates) a perversely fascinating, almost horror movie appeal. But Bourdin isn't the only one with a dark side. Nicholas Barclay came from a family that was deeply troubled even before his disappearance: his mother was a heroin addict; older half-brother Jason (reportedly the last person to talk to Nicholas) had a cocaine problem, which would eventually cause his death; there were violent arguments between mom and Jason, before and after Nicholas never returned home that fateful night in 1994. Bourdin himself suggests that Nicholas was killed by his family, who were then compelled to maintain the fiction that Bourdin was their long-lost son even though they knew he couldn't be\u2014even protecting \"Nicky\" when law enforcement starts to get suspicious. Truth and lies are blurred, and though we never learn the \"whole\" story, there's enough here to make this an intriguing tale. Among its achievements is that it's a fascinating look into the mind of a very disturbed individual\u2014Bourdin\u2014who seems to have no conscience or full understanding of his actions (at first, he's afraid he'll be discovered when he realizes he looks nothing like Nicholas Barclay; later, he actually confesses his crime because his new life in Texas bored him). The film is like an Agatha Christie mystery, but with added psychological insight and offering a perceptive look at how different people\u2014each with his own agenda\u2014played a role in making such an audacious masquerade succeed against all odds. Nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the recent Sundance Film Festival, The Imposter is an unforgettable film, one of the best documentaries of 2012."}
{"text":"Kite Runner\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKite Runner\n\nDirected by Marc Forster\n\nRelease Date:Wednesday, December 26, 2007\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nDirector: Marc Forster\n\nProducer(s):\n\nCast: Ian Charleson, Ben Cross, Ian Holm, John Gielgud\n\nSynopsis\n\nKite Runner is an intense drama set in '70s and '80s era Afghanistan. The film is based on the popular book of the same name written by Khaled Hosseini. It was his first book and a rousing success, pulling in awards and becoming a best seller in the United States. The movie follows the interweaving plot of the book, never losing track of the detailed narrative and characters. Like the book, it accrued mostly positive reviews, garnering an Academy award and several Golden Globe nominations.\n\nThe foreign turmoil of the movie echoed the concerns of many Americans in 2007 when the movie was released. The theme is unrest, with the Afghanistan monarchy falling, the Soviets invading, Afghan residents fleeing, and the founding of the Taliban. In a case of art imitating life, the movie had to be filmed mostly in China due to the violence in Afghanistan. Additionally, the film's release had to be delayed due to concern over the well being of the child actors acting out the brief sexual violence in the film.\n\nKite Runner's story follows Amir, a Kabul native whose parents are well off. Amir can't let go of the fact that he witnessed the brutal rape of his friend and son of his father's servant Hassan. Hassan was protecting a kite that was a gift for Amir. Amir can't handle the guilt of not stepping in and frames Hassan so that his father would be fired. These key events drive the movie, which follows Amir's life through historical events and his personal successes and failures, all the way until he is reminded of the kite runner Hassan. From there he must seek personal redemption.\n\nKite Runner is a movie about unrest, betrayal, and what it means to move forward. It is well acted, especially by the child actors that the early segment focuses on. Emotionally grueling and historically robust, the movie is as educational as it is moving, revealing the difficulties that the fictional Amir and his real-world people have faced. Like Roger Ebert, who called this movie the fifth best film of 2007, I highly recommend checking it out along with the book it is based on."}

{"text":"The Hurt Locker for Best Picture 2009!\n\nSeriously, if you haven't seen this movie, buy, borrow, or bootleg it by any means necessary. It's one of the best-directed, best-acted, and best-scripted films I've ever seen, and I say that without a shred of exaggeration. If the Academy still thinks James Cameron has more talent than Locker director Kathryn Bigelow (his ex-wife), he's probably paying them off.\n\nBut this isn't just a review of the movie. Locker is one of those rare Iraq War films that can't get panned for being Another Stupid Anti-War Movie. It effectively conveys the finer details of explosive ordinance disposal and the emotional side of combat with no needless preaching about the political reasons why Teh Warz is Evil OMG. (See also: Lions for Lambs, Stop-Loss, In the Valley of Elah, etc.)\n\nTo listen to Bill O'Reilly talk about movies like that, you'd think their core flaw is their left-wing position. That's not quite accurate. Their flaw is that they take one unyielding political position, emote about it for one hour, and demonize the other position for the second hour. Right-wing movies, however few and far between, are capable of doing the exact same thing and failing miserably at turning it into a decent screenplay, not to mention improving it a little with direction that isn't completely passive.\n\n\"But, Jess,\" you ask, \"don't you strongly prefer it when people delve into the political side of things? Isn't The Hurt Locker all imagery without making a point?\" First of all, it did make a point: that not everyone who participates in combat reacts to it in the same way, which I would take as a very important message. It never got up on any high horse and said, \"I am right, you are all wrong, and if you question me, I will ridicule you for all eternity.\"\n\nSecond of all, I like it when people delve into the political side the way The West Wing did, by engaging the policy aspect of each episode's issue. It may have subtly favoured Democrats, but it always treated Republicans with respect, except for the occasional caricatures. Doing this inspires serious debate with far less bias. Locker didn't do this, but again, that's because it's not a political movie (how most so-called \"war movies\" of today would be better identified).\n\nSo, if all you've been doing with this column is skimming over it, only paying attention to the long words (you jackass), let me sum up by saying this: The Hurt Locker does for Iraq what Saving Private Ryan did for the invasion of Normandy.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nWhy should the Hollywood backslappers consider a quality movie like that when they're already committed to handing James Cameron a slew of awards for a movie they hadn't even seen when they nominated it? I don't know why anyone still takes these film awards seriously. The level of bribery and insider trading that goes on is staggering."}
{"text":"Review\n\nThe title alone of Kirby Dick's alleged documentary Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist practically screams: \"This is not your standard biopic!\" And the first scene, in which Flanagan reads his own obituary, is all the confirmation we need. Dick's film is an unquestionably straightforward and unflinching depiction of Bob Flanagan's painful and prolonged death from Cystic Fibrosis and the director manages to bend some of the affectations of \"documentary etiquette\" most other filmmakers place on themselves, without ever traversing into essay film territory. Flanagan is portrayed in the film as a mordantly hilarious man who has turned his entire life into a realization of his fictional fantasies. He has made his own body the canvas for his gruesome art displays. Simple enough, but Dick is savvy enough to realize that a scrawny little dude committing various atrocities to his body isn't profound in and of itself and is liable to send audiences running for cover. (Though thanks to a notorious scene involving a hammer, a nail, and Bob's knobby cock, many exited before the final reel anyway.) Instead, what makes Sick more than just a provocation is how Dick conveys how often people attempt to understand those around them in terms of themselves. Though no one, not even Bob, can offer a conclusive explanation for the appeal of sadomasochism, everyone has their own theory (that more often than not speaks to his or her own various life outlooks). Bob suggests that engaging in S&M actually makes him a stronger person, and more resistant to the debilitating effects of his disease (a theory made more plausible when one takes into account that Bob lived a couple decades longer than most CF patients do). His mother, who has already buried two children to CF, seems fairly certain that Bob uses his whips n' chains to punish the body that has betrayed him. Between the two extremes is Bob's life\/artistic partner Sheree, who knows that it's mostly a kinky turn on; but, of course, she could just be saying that because he's her butt-plug bitch."}

{"text":"You are here\n\nThe Italian Job for smugglers: formulaic but fun\n\nElizabeth Dellapenna\n\nMarch 22, 2012 - 19:23\n\n\"You're the geek: you sit, you type quickly, you're quircky and nobody cares if you die\"\n\nThough many people may break a minor law here and there, most do not take major illegal risks. They are never truly exposed to the inner workings of illegal operations or the criminal world. That's where Hollywood comes in - it gives us a chance to experience that kind of danger from the comfort of our theatre seats.\n\nContraband is about a smuggler, named Chris Farraday (Wahlberg), who left behind the world of running contraband. He's dragged back down into the smuggling underworld when his brother-in-law's drug run goes wrong and the drugs have been dumped. The debt must be settled, one way or another. Farraday rounds up a team and heads to Panama to pick up and bring back counterfeit bills worth millions of dollars.\n\nThe scenario is somewhat unusual in that it represents the world of smuggling. Films of the criminal nature typically represent robberies and there is a bit of that too. Though the concept is somewhat unusual, how many times are we going to see a criminal with a good cause, who asssembles a crack unit to avenge some injustice, all the time cracking jokes and dealing with mishaps? In some ways, it felt like The Italian Job or Ocean's Eleven by having those elements.\n\nThat being said, the film is actually rather well done for what it is. And unlike Ocean's Eleven, the film has more gritty realism. It's less glamorous or glossed over than its predecessors. This effect was achieved, in part, because of the cinematography. There is a lot of handheld and the colours are a bit unsaturated, giving it a more washed-out look.\n\nNew Orleans was also a good choice of location, especially since the city is still in the process of getting over the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. It adds a good, gritty backdrop to the story.\n\nAs for the acting, it's not extraordinary - but even if it was, the plot does not really feature character development. Ultimately, the acting was good enough. The film focuses on the story and the surprising reveals of how certain things were accomplished.\n\nTrue to formula, it's important that some actors have the right charisma, so we know which to like or hate immediately. Wahlberg is adequate in the role, playing the same type of character he has in the past - not dissimilar to The Italian Job. And we are able to quickly establish him as likeable and the good guy, though that depends obviously on whether you like him to begin with.\n\nThe writing also helped this film rise above its more Hollywood-esque rivals. For once, not everything works out as planned. This helped to build more tension in the plot and it definitely threw off the direction of where the film was headed.\n\nMany films feature everything falling into place immediately. Although we kind of know deep down that everything will work out for our hero, we're not always sure how.\n\nThe story is like a puzzle, but the audience isn't given all of the pieces. Instead, we are given bits and pieces that tend to only make sense later on when we see their true meaning in context.\n\nWe are supposed to be dazzled by the cleverness of the idea, as each accomplishment is revealed along with the realisation of what must have taken place. Still, overall it's an entertaining experience."}

{"text":"Tim Burton has taken the animated short that launched his career and expanded it into a vivid and moving essay on science and love--the love a budding middle-school scientist, Victor Frankenstein, has for his dog Sparky.\n\nThat was the kernel of the original 1984 \"Frankenweenie,\" back at the beginning of Burton's career. Burton gives that genius concept full voice in a rich, delicately textured 3-D jewel in the stop-motion animation style.\n\nVictor (voiced by Charlie Tahan) is a loner, a smart kid who spends hours in the attic, fiddling with science projects. He's pretty much friendless, save for his beloved weenie dog, Sparky.\n\nMom (Catherine O'Hara) indulges him, but Dad (Martin Short) wants the boy to get out, make some friends and take up a sport.\n\nVictor just wants to come up with a project for the big science fair at school.\n\nDad suggests they \"compromise,\" and to Dad, that means \"nobody gets what they want,\" so Victor finds himself at the plate, struggling to master baseball.\n\nMiracle of miracles, he hits a home run. But a highlight of his young life is crushed when Sparky chases the home-run ball into the street and is killed.\n\nVictor, a morose, quiet kid, mourns in a morose, quiet way. Mom's reassurance that no one you ever love dies, \"they just move into a special place in your heart,\" isn't enough. It's only when Victor sits through a demented, inspired thunder-storm lesson by his Eastern Bloc science teacher (the always inspired Martin Landau) that he has his answer.\n\nMr. Rzykruski has made a dead frog's muscles twitch with electricity. Victor will dig up Sparky, patch and stitch him up, attach a positive and negative lead on his neck (bolts, of course) and thunder-storm jolt his beloved dog back to life.\n\nBurton revels in the props and appliances Victor re-purposes for his project. But he ensures that there's an animated warmth to the boy's connection to this playful goof of a mutt, who is pretty much his old self once he's revived--save for the odd body part that falls off."}
{"text":"Period pieces are part of a genre, like horror or romantic comedy, in which certain tropes and themes are essential: big, beautiful costumes and castles, fancy accents, forbidden love and horses. They're usually set in England or America pre-20th century. This year, Magnolia Pictures delivers a Danish period piece with a pretty leading lady, two not so pretty leading men and a colorful background called A Royal Affair.\n\nIn late 1700s Europe, a teenage English girl named Caroline (Alicia Vikander) is arranged to marry the next king of Denmark (Mikkel F\u00f8lsgaard). Soon after she moves into his castle, she discovers he's mentally unstable and immature and doesn't care about ruling the country. Later Struensee, a physician who moonlights as an anonymous radical theorist (Mads Mikkelsen), is randomly assigned to the king in hopes of keeping him in good spirits. When he and Caroline discover the Danish government is trying to manipulate the king into keeping censorship legal and turning a blind eye to poverty, the pair decide to influence the king's decision-making for the good. But the plot thickens, as Struensee and Caroline become attracted to each other.\n\nVikander, also in Anna Karenina this month, is visually compelling, as she is breathtaking in the lead role. Like Caroline, the Swedish actress had to learn a new language for the role and still doesn't miss a beat. Mikkelsen of Casino Royale fame is fine as the physician, but it's newcomer F\u00f8lsgaard who steals the show of the main males. Like all period pieces, even if the storyline is boring, you can still count on the cinematography and art direction to be gorgeous. Nikolaj Arcel's film is visually captivating but shy of perfection. While the scenes focusing on the economic issues of Denmark at the time are interesting, the scenes with the love triangle aren't so much. Mikkelsen and Vikander aren't as intriguing intimately as they are independently"}

Street evangelicals of every stripe are legion in his hometown, but he is most offended by the cynical sidewalk salesmanship of blind prophet Asa Hawks (Stanton) and his flirtatious daughter, Sabbath Lily (Wright). So Hazel starts his own sect, claiming Jesus is a fraud, and that mankind doesn't need to be redeemed, attracting the notice of feeble-minded obsessive Enoch Emory (Dan Schor).\n\nWhy I Love It:\n\nDourif is brilliant in Huston's \"Wise Blood,\" based on the novel by Flannery O'Connor, playing a man at war with his own ingrained sense of religion and morality. He is helped, of course, by a terrific cast including Stanton, Wright, Dan Schor as a wayward young disciple, and Ned Beatty as an oily con man who wants to get a piece of Motes's \"Church Without Christ.\" Dark, twisted, and perversely funny at times, \"Wise Blood\" takes square aim at old-style belief but not at the underlying impulse that leads people to long for personal salvation."}

{"text":"Storyline Written by\nJeremy Perkins <jwp@aber.ac.uk>\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nUser Reviews\n\nThis is an extraordinary film, from a play by Noel Coward. Starting on New Years Eve in 1899, the film goes on an emotional ride through 33 years of British history - ending on New Years Eve 1932. Through the lives of the members of one household (and two families one upper class, the other their servants)we visit the Boer War, the death of Queen Victoria, the Titanic, World War One and the Jazz Age. The film ends with the hope of a more peaceful world - a hope saddened by our knowledge that 1933 was to be the year that Hitler came to power.\n\nThis is very much an anti-war film, with the World War One scenes very powerful and the sad loss of a mother portrayed vividly as a woman learns of the death of her son as the rest of the world celebrates the end of the war. You won't forget this image.\n\nSumptuously shot and beautifully directed, the film is best when it is visual as it does suffer some of the sound problems associated with early talkies - and some of the acting is a little melodramatic. Diana Wynard's performance alternates between magnificent and hammy constantly - suggesting she was a little uncertain how to act for the camera. And look out quickly for an early portrayal of a gay male couple (snuck in by Coward I suspect!).\n\nBut this film is astonishingly relevant to us as we move into a new century. Let's not repeat the mistakes of the last. Coward speaks to us strongly from the grave.\n\n14 of 19 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?"}
{"text":"The film traces the life of Hwang Jin Yi, a 16th century gisaeng - a female entertainer-artist similar to the Japanese geisha - remembered as both a distinguished poet and alluring femme fatale.\n\nBorn into a respected noble family, the charming Hwang leads a peaceful life in the city of Songdo. But when her scandalous birth secrets are revealed, she voluntarily chooses the lowly life of a gisaeng.\n\nHwang, brought to life by Song Hye-gyo, evolves from an innocent damsel to smoldering temptress. Song gives an impressive performance of her character's winding emotional journey, and breaks away from her image as a sweet-faced starlet.\n\n\"Hwang\" is original in both senses of the word. The film portrays not so much the artistic gisaeng we saw hitherto in other works, but the human Hwang based on the novel of the same title by North Korean writer Hong Seok-jung.\n\nHong conducted thorough research in the gisaeng's hometown of Gaeseong, and his heroine is considered to most closely reflect the actual historical figure. From there, he created a fictional love story and won the 2004 Manhae Prize for Literature, one of the most prestigious literary awards in South Korea.\n\nIn the film, Hwang spurns the decadence and hypocrisy of the noble class, and lives with a sense of independence that women today can look up to. But beneath her confidence and indifference, Hwang is a heartbroken woman torn between her lover Nomi, played by heartthrob Yoo Ji-tae, and the powerful district magistrate Hui-yeol, impersonated by Ryu Seung-ryong."}
{"text":"Related Fan AlertsAnderson explained that Vanishing isn't the most straightforward movie, with plenty of mystery left over as the credits roll.\n\nI like the fact that this movie keeps the mystery alive all the way through the end and kind of lets the audience debate among themselves what might be possible explanations. Of course we put little clues in there as to possible explanations, I suppose, but we never really settle on one or the other. So the movie becomes more of a point of debate\u2026\n\nThe movie and the story is really about characters who are confronted with this huge mystery and they're sort of grasping at straws looking for some kind of explanation and ultimately realize that maybe it's beyond our understanding, that there isn't an explanation.

Entertaining movies also make you think but most of all make you feel you money was well spent. Vanishing on 7th street had some good ideas but it was left unresolved and was without any conclusion. The 4 characters in the movie had the advantage over all the people that died days before since they understood how to survive. They understood the rules of survival yet the more Knowledgeable and survival driven characters ended up dying unnecessarily. Which begs the question what was the point of it all. What was the point making or watching this movie. A movie has to tell a story. Like a language it has to be understood by someone or there is a break down of communication between audience and director.

I really did like it overall, especially the casting of Daniel Craig as Kalle Blomqvist who is spot on, Christopher Plummer, and Stellan Skarsgaard was terrific as Martin (but I always like him).\n\nNow on to the negativity: Why kill off a perfectly lovely cousin and change the story re. uncovering Harriet in Australia, complete with family? I told my sis-in-law that they must have run out of money to complete that part of the plot after that absurdly cool but waaaayy too long oily intro. Self-indulgent is exactly right.\n\nAnd casting someone 20 years younger than the actual character (Joely Richardson, forever Nip\/Tuck train wreck to me) is ridiculous. So she's the best-preserved 60+ year old ever or does Fincher think the audience is too stupid to do the math? Dumb.\n\nFinally, I hated the casting of the evil social worker Bjurman and that they changed the tattooing she did on his gut. Why?\n\nOkay, finished complaining. I did like it, really! And it was a much better interpretation of a Nordic film than many others I've cringed through in the past \u2013Insomnia and The Kingdom being some prime stinkers.\n\nWhy kill off a perfectly lovely cousin, indeed! Agreed, they must have run out of money because that was a whiplash of a wrap-up relative to the near three hours we spent over all. And yes, I want to look as well-preserved at sixty as Ms. Richardson.\n\nYou could have stopped at \"Daniel Craig looks absolutely amazing.\" Yummy, yummy man.\n\nI haven't read the books, so I don't have many complaints. I do think the ending was rushed and someone had to explain how Lisbeth donning a wig and flying around the world caused the dude's death. But maybe I'm just dense.\n\nIt was a perfectly acceptable thriller and I look forward to the trilogy's remaining films."}

{"text":"Shuji (Hidetoshi Nishijima), the central character in Amir Naderi's Cut, is a figure not unknown to anyone likely to see the film in America. He lives alone, in an apartment wallpapered with lobby cards and movie stills. He hosts screenings on his roof, running prints of Keaton and Ford films. He reverentially visits the tombs of Kurosawa, Ozu, Mizoguchi. And he walks the streets with a bullhorn, shouting pronouncements of the dire state of cinema. \"The artistic side of cinema is dying! Most of today's movies are simply made to entertain!\" he seethes. \"They have no right to extinguish pure cinema!\" He has attempted to contribute to the art himself, but his films thus far have only managed to lose the money provided to Shuji by his brother, a yakuza enforcer. Then Shuji finds out that those debts were never repaid--and his brother has been killed. He has inherited the balance of the debt, over 12 million yen. He has two weeks to make it right. The threatening man who gives him that information doesn't say what will happen at the end of that two weeks. He doesn't have to; there's a head-sized box on his desk.\n\nThere's something rather delicious about this set-up, in which the movie-crazy aesthete finds himself in a remarkably cinematic situation, and--one would think--must find a definitively real-world solution. Instead, Naderi's uses it as a realization of the all-too-commonly invoked notion of suffering for one's art--and drawing strength from it. This is not metaphorical suffering and strength; the scheme that Shuji stumbles into, somewhat accidentally, is to offer himself up as a paid punching bag for the various gangsters and gamblers that work for and with the organization. He gets paid by the punch. At first, he lets them punch anywhere, but it quickly becomes clear that he won't last long doing that. So he charges five thousand yen per body blow, and takes the abuse. And takes it, and takes more.\n\nAs he subjects himself to the punishment, he reminds himself of what it is worth, what he is paying off (the films he made) and what he is preserving (the life ahead of him--one in which, presumably, he will watch and make more movies). At first, he mutters trivia to himself. Later, when the going gets tougher, he hypes himself up and keeps himself going with a contemptuous cry of \"shit movies!\" He visualizes himself as the art, of the purity; he takes the punches of crass commerce.\n\nIf it sounds a little silly, blame the messenger--there's all sorts of ways to read what's happening here, and it's the kind of film that allows interpretation without insisting on it. If it sounds brutal and ugly, well, it is (a little, anyway), but it's not a cheap or exploitative picture; Naderi is a classicist, using deliberate pacing and unconventional rhythms early on to soften viewers up and acclimate them to his speed. His compositions are dynamic but clean, carefully arranged within his mostly locked frames (camera movements are deliberate and purposeful).\n\nSome of the stylistic touches don't quite play, like the switches to black and white during those tomb visits, a ponderous shot of a punching bag during the first beating session, or the puzzling cutaways to aerial city shots during a particularly desperate fight scene. But for the most part, the picture is technically masterful, and shows a remarkable visual efficiency.\n\nIt probably gives little away to hint that the scheme goes down to the wire, with a heavily battered Shuji finally determining that one last day of sheer hell, one final pummeling that will risk his life, is a small price to pay. \"I want to live! I want to make films!\" he insists--finding, in art, the very will to live. And thus is constructed Cut's most electrifying sequence, in which he wagers that the can take 100 punches and survive. To push himself through, he ticks off his 100 favorite films (a task any movie lover relishes), which are seen as text on screen as the pounding progresses. And then Naderi does something really interesting: he takes the sound effects out, and lays in that bullhorn audio, those announcements of what he's (literally) fighting for, which compliment the examples of it in the titles and names on screen. It all comes together--thought it seems at first a gimmick, he's actually creating a manifesto film, something borderline Godardian. And he's creating an additional cause for rooting interest: thought the list is supposed to be \"in no particular order,\" he's clearly ranking at least the top slots, and we're really want to see what his top ten is--even more, perhaps, then we want to see him survive. Cold blooded? No, just cinematically curious. Something tells me Shuji would understand"}
{"text":"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole\n\nThe hero's journey is a classic. From \"The Lord of the Rings\" to \"Star Wars,\" the story of the young, untested kid being forced into an epic journey to find his inner strength and eventually vanquish the gathering forces of evil never gets tired.\n\nThat is, if you do it right.\n\nThe animated \"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole\" tries to follow that arc as owlet Soren (Jim Sturgess, \"21\") is kidnapped from his hollow, escapes from captivity and makes the journey to the mythical Tree of Ga'Hoole to enlist the help of the Guardians.\n\nIt seems like it would be easy to follow the usual pattern \"\" the call to adventure, the refusal, the supernatural helper, the transformation, etc. \"\" to move Soren along his destined path. However, director Zack Snyder (\"Watchmen\") doesn't seem interested much in making a coherent story.\n\nSoren beings with his jealous, less-talented brother, Kludd (Ryan Kwanten, TV's \"True Blood\"), learning how to fly and playing Guardian. When the sibs dare each other to go flying without parental supervision, they wind up on the ground, where they're snatched up by roving representatives of the Pure Ones, a group of racist owls led by Metalbeak (Joel Edgerton, \"Animal Kingdom\") and his mate, Nyra (Helen Mirren, \"Red\").\n\nThe Pure Ones are gathering owlets to brainwash to their cause, which seems to be domination of the entire owl world, possibly with a side of ethnic cleansing. Toward this goal, they force their slaves to gather little bits of metal from owl pellets, which, when piled together, create some kind of magnetic field that disorients owl by doing something unclear to their \"gizzards.\"\n\nSoren escapes, while Kludd embraces the warm fuzzies that come with being part of a fascist collective. Soren escapes with Gylfie (Aussie actress Emily Barclay) and they search for the Guardians, picking up a couple of other owls along the way, and finding Soren's snake nursemaid, Mrs. Plithiver (Miriam Margolyes, \"Happy Feet\"). They travel together across the sea until they reach their goal.\n\nOnce there, they find that the Guardians are real, and the events that made them famous aren't really that far in the past. Soren meets his hero, Ezylryb (Geoffrey Rush, \"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\"), now a semiretired chronicler. He takes Soren under his wing, so to speak, and mentors him in the art of flying battle.\n\nThe look of \"Legends\" is fantastic, but the story feels disjointed. This is probably because \"\" like too many movies \"\" it's based on a series of novels. This one supposedly covers the first three books. Unless those books are really short, that's way too much to pack into one movie.\n\nWhile it's not a horrible start, if Snyder and company plan to produce sequels, they should spend a little less time making animated bird feathers pop out of the screen and a little more time nailing down the script."}
{"text":"No related\n\nLet's be clear about this from the start: Gaspar No\u00e9's Irr\u00e9versible isn't for everyone, to put it mildly. Of the 24 entries in our Inventory \"Great Films Too Painful To Watch Twice,\" it's to my mind the most extreme and difficult to sit through, a rape-revenge thriller that's deliberately calculated to attack the nervous system and keep viewers in a near-constant state of queasy disorientation. It has as its centerpiece a nine-minute, single-take rape scene that's as horrifying to witness as anything I can recall seeing in a theater; and since it unfolds in reverse chronology, the \"happy ending\" feels nearly as sadistic, because we know what happens in the future. No\u00e9 has been called a \"punk nihilist,\" and like any good punk, his work deconstructs and alienates; it's safe to imagine him agreeing with John Waters' famed sentiment that someone puking during one of his movies is like a standing ovation. (Waters himself called Irr\u00e9versible \"the most shocking movie I ever saw in my life\" and, amusingly, \"the worst date movie in the history of cinema.\")\n\nBefore I finally caught up with Irr\u00e9versible at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, it existed as an urban legend as much as a movie. Earlier in the year, the film premi\u00e8red to uproar at Cannes, where more than half the black-tied legions stuffed into the massive Lumi\u00e8re theater reportedly walked out in disgust. So when I sat down at the late, lamented Uptown 1 Theater\u2014at the time, the festival's non-Gala equivalent to the Lumi\u00e8re in terms of seating and screen size\u2014there was a palpable feeling of dread among many in the audience. (At least among those who had read up on it. Others just peeling off another coupon from their ticket package were woefully unprepared.) And as jaded as untold thousands of movies have made me, and as firmly as I braced myself for it, watching Irr\u00e9versible remains one of the rare cases where the experience itself was worse than anything my imagination could conjure.\n\nThe first impulse after seeing Irr\u00e9versible is to take a shower, literally and metaphorically, but it isn't a movie that's so easily washed away. While I would never begrudge anyone for simply not having the stomach for it, I think the mass revulsion that greeted it from many quarters was too hasty and ill-considered. Too many critics found it enough to simply write off No\u00e9 as a sadist and a homophobe who tries to couch a reprehensible vision in facile, pretentious philosophizing. Though I would describe my own opinion of the film as strongly ambivalent, I bristle at the then-prevailing wisdom that it was worthless and beneath discussion merely because it isn't pleasant to experience. There's actually a lot going on in No\u00e9's bold provocation, so let's drop an Alka-Seltzer and dig in.\n\n(At this point, those who haven't seen Irr\u00e9versible\u2014and aren't scared off by the prospect\u2014are advised to take leave. I wouldn't want to spoil the beginning for you.)\n\nDivided into 12 scenes, Irr\u00e9versible unfolds from the end to the beginning, opening with an aged Philippe Nahon, as \"The Butcher\" from No\u00e9's nasty debut feature I Stand Alone, voicing regret for the life he's lived. \"Time destroys everything,\" he says. From there, No\u00e9's film sets out to put that thesis into action. Primed to maximum disorientation, the first 15 minutes are a near-literal descent into hell, with swirling camera movements and oppressive, bass-heavy sound effects that turn the stomach before the images even have a chance to shock. Hell, in this case, is a fetishistic gay nightclub called \"The Rectum,\" where Vincent Cassel searches frantically for the man who raped and pummeled his girlfriend Monica Bellucci earlier in the evening. Though his friend Albert Dupontel\u2014who, importantly, turns out to be Bellucci's ex\u2014pleads for Cassel to come to his senses, the search ends with an act of unbelievable violence, which retroactively becomes the first of many cruel ironies to come.\n\nIt isn't until later\u2014or in this case, earlier\u2014that we find out the context for Cassel' deranged quest for revenge. Until that point, he simply seems out of his mind, spewing epithets and shaking down people for information with a fists-first approach that would shame Mike Hammer. Seeing him behave like this before we know why is an effective strategy for No\u00e9, who wants to show the breakdown of order and the deterioration of the rational mind. When we finally learn what happened to Bellucci, it explains Cassel's actions without necessarily justifying them, which is an important distinction to make, and one I'll get into in a bit. Our first encounter with Bellucci is maybe the saddest moment in the film: As Cassel and Dupontel leave a party, they come upon her laid out unconscious on a gurney, her face bloodied and lacerated nearly beyond recognition. And then just one quick cut into the past, she's Monica Bellucci, one of the world's most beautiful women, looking stunning in a silky, skin-tight party dress.\n\nBy the time the infamous rape scene happens, the movie has gone through a reel or so, and it's worth pointing out that the majority of the walkouts\u2014at least at my screening, and I suspect at others, too\u2014have already occurred. For 20 minutes, No\u00e9 has ground the audience down with his vertigo-inducing 720\u00b0 camera movements and low-frequency soundtrack, courtesy of Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter. Now he follows Bellucci into a symbolically loaded red tunnel beneath the city, where she crosses paths with a vicious pimp (Jo Prestia) who pins her down at knifepoint, sexually assaults her, then smashes her face in for good measure. In contrast to the visual and aural pyrotechnics that preceded it, No\u00e9 bolts the camera to the floor for the seemingly endless duration of this horrific act, and with the help of special effects\u2014not to mention the fearless contributions of Bellucci and Prestia\u2014he gets the whole incident in one take.\n\nThere's only one proper reaction to the rape scene in Irr\u00e9versible, and that's revulsion. Opinions vary widely over whether it's necessary or gratuitous, and I can sympathize with those who resent No\u00e9 for including a scene this potent in a movie that can't support it. A few have speculated that No\u00e9 is somehow appealing to extreme misogynists who might take pleasure in seeing a woman abused, but that's nearly impossible for me to take seriously; there's nothing to take away from what happens to Bellucci other than abject horror, pure and simple. What we witness is needless destruction, and it's a stretch for people to speculate that No\u00e9 is appealing to the sickos just because they personally find his film empty and his motivations suspect.\n\nThe other, more legitimate concern is over the film's alleged homophobia, which I have trouble defending. Bellucci's assailant tells her that he doesn't normally go for women, and indeed, he frequents The Rectum, where keen-eyed viewers will notice, likely on second viewing, that he manages to sidestep Cassel' revenge plot. In one important sense, No\u00e9 needs to make it clear that the assailant's actions have nothing to do with sexuality and everything to do with man's power to destroy, and having Prestia be a heterosexual might make that distinction impossible. And yet I have trouble denying the film's depiction of gay men as the height of filth and depravity, based on the rape scene and the long descent into the nightclub. Contrast that with a blissful bedroom scene later in the film, with Bellucci and Cassel frolicking in a hetero paradise, and that impression is confirmed. Some of the film's most ardent defenders have talked of The Rectum as a place of ambiguous sexuality, but I just can't see it.\n\nThere are other things about Irr\u00e9versible that bother me, too, like the too-neat ironies and foreshadowing (or \"postshadowing,\" as my colleague Noel Murray called it) that its reverse structure allows. Having Bellucci's assailant on the sidelines while Cassel and Dupontel go after the wrong man in The Rectum effectively underlines the futility of revenge, but having the man's face pummeled in much the same manner as Bellucci's is a little pat. So too is a scene later (earlier) in the bedroom when Cassel floats the idea of anal sex to Bellucci, and she scoffs it away, when we know she'll be submitting to it involuntarily. And then there are the sick what-might-have-been scenarios at the party: Would Bellucci have been raped had a drunk, coked-up Cassel not driven her away with his loutish behavior? What if she had listened to Dupontel on the way out, when he warned her it was too dangerous to leave alone? When a story is told backward, hindsight is definitely 20\/20.\n\nIn spite of these serious reservations, though, Irr\u00e9versible is extraordinarily ambitious and accomplished in other ways. For one, the backward timeline makes the strongest imaginable argument against vigilantism. As the title suggests, there's no going back in this life: Revenge doesn't change what's happened. What is tarnished and ripped apart cannot be made whole again.\n\nIt's little like the \"remote control\" moment in Funny Games stretched out to feature length, only it's No\u00e9 holding the clicker; he presses the rewind button and offers the fantasy of acts being undone, but we as viewers are acutely aware that time doesn't move in that direction. Cassel' quest for blood doesn't change anything but himself and Dupontel, who's goaded into an act of violence that eradicates his hyper-rational nature.\n\nBy going in reverse, Irr\u00e9versible also gives a deeper sense of what's lost, underlined by the crushing revelation in the final scene. In No\u00e9's mind, time is a journey from purity and innocence to degradation and corruption, and there's nothing a person can do to turn back the clock. However, there's another, more radical way of looking at it that's improbably bittersweet: Since No\u00e9's timeline goes from hell to heaven, darkness to light, rape to un-rape, he's really offering a dream that things could be different, our humanity could be restored, and paradise could be attainable. (As my friend, Cyprus Mail critic Theo Panayides, eloquently put it, the film is \"reaching for a tranquil Eden forever lost.\") Those final images of Bellucci, looking radiant on the impossibly green park grass with children playing and Beethoven's Seventh swelling on the soundtrack, can make viewers forget, just for a moment, that transcendence is possible. Such is the power of the movies."}
{"text":"Story\n\nThe Russian answer to 2001, and very nearly as memorable a movie. The legendary Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky made this extremely deliberate science-fiction epic, an adaptation of a novel by Stanislaw Lem. The story follows a cosmonaut (Donatas Banionis) on an eerie trip to a planet where haunting memories can take physical form. Its bare outline makes it sound like a routine space-flight picture, an elongated Twilight Zone episode; but the further into its mysteries we travel, the less familiar anything seems. Even though Tarkovsky's meanings and methods are sometimes mystifying, Solaris has a way of crawling inside your head, especially given the slow pace and general lack of forward momentum. By the time the final images cross the screen, Tarkovsky has gone way beyond SF conventions into a moving, unsettling vision of memory and home. Well worthy of cult status, Solaris is both challenging art-house fare and a whacked-out head trip. --Robert Horton"}

So did movies-based-on-super-hero-comics and movies-based-on-alt-comix, at first. There was Crumb (1995) and Ghost World (2000). Then came American Splendor, about Cleveland autobiographical-comic writer Harvey Pekar.\n\nThe 2003 drama-documentary plays with comic-book frames and speech\/thought balloons (and less showily than Ang Lee did the same year in Hulk). Breaking up stretches of narrative re-enacted by Paul Giamatti (as Pekar) and Hope Davis (as his wife Joyce), Pekar himself appears in white space, the panel of his little world becoming filled with props and people. The approach perfectly suits a man whose life and art were as entwined as a double-helix; American Splendor channels Pekar's vision of art and life as twinned struggles.\n\nHis personal lookin'-down-at-the-cracks-in-the-sidewalk bleeds into little-guy-on-main-street politics. In the '80s, he sees corporations co-opting salt-of-the-earth types so, while grappling with a cancer diagnosis, he gets fed up with Letterman using him as comic relief and protests GE's control of NBC during one of his guest appearances.\n\nOne of cinema's great first-date sequences is here: guy tells girl he's had a vasectomy; she throws up after their \"yuppie meal.\" They're surprised they like each other, since both are so resigned to disappointment. And Joyce had worried about which Harvey she'd meet, given his different images depending on his comic's illustrator.\n\nWe're splendidly shown how a lower-class nine-to-fiver has his own creative selves and richly expressive life. When Pekar's observing people at his file-clerk day job, catching the snippets of spoken poetry in others' prosaic routines, the film looks ahead to the best of today's blogs. Too bad most comic-book movies now aren't Pekar-esque at all but like the worst of the blogosphere: shouting, sniping and blasting-off without any recognizable human feeling or sense of life as \"pretty complex stuff"}

{"text":"The Sum Of All Fears (pg-13, 119 Min.)\n\nJune 7, 2002|LINDA HORWITZ FAMILY FLIMGOER\n\nJingoism, fear-mongering and simple-minded corniness mar this high-gloss international thriller based on the Tom Clancy novel. And Ben Affleck, so good in the current Changing Lanes (R), seems callow and weightless as a young version of Clancy's CIA hero, Jack Ryan, despite a highly credible supporting cast.\n\nNo, the movie's greater, grimmer triumph -- its magnetic pull -- is its all-too-believable rendering of what destruction and governmental chaos would result if a powerful weapon -- in this case a nuclear bomb -- were detonated in an American city.\n\nThat will make it too intense for many younger teens, especially if they're prone to nightmares sparked by the evening news, and it's a poor choice for preteens. The Sum of All Fears vividly evokes a nuclear blast and the ensuing inferno. The victims' wounds aren't graphic, but certain ash-filled scenes do recall the World Trade Center attack. The movie contains more banal violence, too, most of it understated, including fights, gunplay, a strangling and a car-bombing. Other mature elements include mild sexual innuendo (Ryan spends the night with his doctor girlfriend, played by Bridget Moynahan) and profanity.\n\nThe plot is convoluted and more likely to hold the interest of audiences with memories of Cold War issues. Bedouins stumble upon a nuclear device in the buried wreckage of an Israeli plane, shot down 29 years before. A neo-fascist industrialist (Alan Bates) gets hold of it. Ryan is chosen by the CIA director (Morgan Freeman) to analyze mysteriously provocative acts by Russia. Or maybe by someone else?\n\nUndercover Brother (PG-13, 85 min.)\n\nA good-natured and intermittently very funny spoof, Undercover Brother satirizes race relations, 1970s blaxploitation movies and high-tech secret agent flicks with generally well-aimed barbs. The social satire laced with pratfalls will entertain hipper teens and offer a dash of enlightenment to those who don't quite grasp that popular culture can make black Americans (and other minorities) feel marginalized. It includes mild sexual innuendo, rare profanity and allusions to marijuana.\n\nEpisodic and uneven, Undercover Brother is not a great comic film. Scenes play like skits, some clicking and others clunking. Even at its brief length it seems to run out of steam before the finish. But it hits home often enough.\n\nBased on a popular Internet animated series, it introduces Undercover Brother (Eddie Griffin), an ultra-cool hero with a funkadelic 'fro who commits Robin Hood-style acts, such as erasing poor people's mortgage records at a bank. He's recruited by the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a secret organization devoted to stopping the anti-black conspiracies of a faceless foe called The Man.\n\nThe Man's latest plot against black America involves the destruction of a powerful ex-general and likely presidential candidate (Billy Dee Williams) with a psychotropic drug (administered by Chris Kattan as The Man's evil lieutenant). Instead of announcing his candidacy, he says he's opening a chain of fried chicken shops. The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., which includes paranoid Conspiracy Brother (Dave Chappelle) and level-headed Sistah Girl (Aunjanue Ellis) must get to the bottom of the plot."}
{"text":"Compared with other movies,\nSeven Psychopaths is clever and inventive enough to be considered a weak success or a\nmodest failure.\n\nBut considering that it was written and directed by Martin McDonagh, the playwright turned\nfilmmaker who gave us the brilliant\nIn Bruges,\nSeven Psychopaths is a disappointment.\n\nThe film has the feeling of a writer skating the surface of his ability and settling for cheap\ngestures.\n\nHis new picture presents a boy's world, with plenty of sketchy but flamboyant characters\ninhabited by name actors, and each gets a chance to be flashy. At the head of the ensemble is an\nappealing Colin Farrell as an Irish screenwriter named Martin, whose writer's block prevents him\nfrom writing a screenplay he is contracted to deliver. All he has is the title,\nSeven Psychopaths, and an idea that he wants his psychopath story to be ultimately\nhumane.\n\nSo the screenwriter, like McDonagh, is an Irishman named Martin, and throughout, the movie mixes\nthings that Martin imagines with his frequent and increasing encounters with real-life psychopaths\nin his daily life. Among the latter is Martin's increasingly erratic best friend, played by Sam\nRockwell. Rockwell does his best to make sense of the broad but thin character and fights the role\nto a draw.\n\nAn opening scene, with Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Pitt as a pair of hit men, not only\nresolves in a way that will amaze and delight, but the framing of the shot is so witty that it\nmakes the audience expect great things.

{"text":"Synopsis\nA peaceful Midwestern city attempts to recover after it is destroyed by a nuclear missile strike in this powerful and deeply disturbing testament to the folly of pro-military hawks who believed that annihilation was a justifiable means of attaining power and control. The Day After originally aired on network television. At the end of the broadcast, many stations offered teams of counselors staffing 800 telephone numbers to help distraught viewers calm down. ~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide\n\nWhen The Day After premiered on network TV in 1983, I was 13 years old. I still remember the big 2-page ad for the movie in TV Guide - a picture of a Kansas farm woman looking up at the nuclear missles streaking across the sky above her. It looked like a must-see movie, so I watched it. I thought it was one of the best anti-war movies ever, and I stil do.\n\n1983 also saw the theatrical release of the classic cyberthriller WarGames, where a government supercomputer performs realistic simulations of nuclear war in order to determine how America could win such a war, should it take place. The computer concludes that the only way for us to win a nuclear war is to not participate in one.\n\nThe Day After illustrates that point in its chillingly accurate depiction of a nuclear war as seen in America's heartland. It begins with a seemingly mild conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that quickly escalates. Before the people of a Kansas town can even comprehend what the conflict is about, the U.S. government declares war on the Soviets and both countries send their nuclear missles flying.\n\nIn a series of impressive special effects, we see the massive devastation caused by the missle strikes. But the immediate effects are just the beginning. Jason Robards is excellent as the doctor who turns his hospital into a rescue center. With his medical supplies dwindling and the government in state of chaos, all Robards can do is watch people die, as radiation sickness consumes a sizeable part of the population.\n\nJohn Lithgow, JoBeth Williams, and even Steve Guttenberg also give fine performances.\n\nIt look a lot of guts for ABC to greenlight this movie. In 1983, Ronald Reagan was in the White House, and as soon as he took office, his ultra-right wing administration began whipping up anti-communist paranoia, taking it to a point not seen since the McCarthy era in the 1950s. He even had public schools bring back the old \"duck and cover\" drills for a while.\n\nNeedless to say, many movies at the time echoed Reagan's propaganda, with the good 'ol USA coming out on top of the evil commie Russkies. The Day After is no propaganda film. America doesn't win the nuclear war. There's no happy ending, no patriotic flag-waving crap, just human suffering and plenty of it.\n\nThe Reagan administration was determined to make us believe that we could win a nuclear war against the Soviets. They must have been furious when this movie was broadcast and received incredible ratings.\n\nWhile the Soviet Union no longer exists and Russia is now our ally, this movie is still relevant as an anti-war statement in these uncertain times - and what a powerful statement it is!\n\nOne final note: this DVD version is the \"director's cut\" of The Day After, which runs over 20 minutes longer than the original TV broadcast version. This version was released theatrically in Europe. In the 1970s and 1980's, when most TV movies were well made, it was customary to add extra scenes to them and release them theatrically in other countries. 99% of today's TV movies are so bad that they're not worth distributing outside the U.S., added scenes or not. :o)"}

{"text":"Screen\n\nThe X-Files: I Want to Believe\n\nJeffrey M. Anderson\n\nThu, Jul 24, 2008 (midnight)\n\nThe big question, 10 years after the first X-Files movie and six years after the series ended, is: What's the point of a new movie? But the real question is: Why not? FBI agents Fox Mulder (Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Anderson) had unbeatable chemistry, and their combination, Mulder as a believer in the supernatural and Scully as a scientist (who believed in God), made for interesting\u2014and ultimately unanswerable\u2014questions. And here they are again, still cool and attractive but a little older and retired from FBI life. Scully now works full-time as a doctor, while Mulder skulks around in a back room in their shared house, combing the newspapers for interesting events. (Their son is not present and mentioned only in passing.)\n\nIn a case involving a missing agent, a psychic and convicted pedophile called \"Father Joe\" (Connolly) has been providing agents Dakota Whitney (Peet) and Mosley Drummy (Joiner) with just enough information to keep them guessing. So Mulder is coaxed back on the job to determine the man's reliability. Meanwhile, Scully faces a dire situation at work\u2014a young boy with a terminal illness. Can she save him? Should she try? That's the centerpiece of this film; the questions are a bit more elusive than usual and a bit less interesting. Likewise, the story, about a Frankenstein-like mad doctor who experiments on his kidnapped patients, plays a bit more like a lesser TV episode than anything that should be viewed on the big screen.\n\nIt's as if director and co-writer Carter decided to make a movie without knowing what kind of story to tell. Moreover, the show was still running when the 1998 film was released, so there was a kind of anticipation for the film to provide some big answers. That thrill is gone, but we shouldn't discount the place for epilogues and endings in pop culture. Now a couple, Mulder and Scully discuss and banter some more (and it's a lot more interesting than conversations about the mortgage or taking out the garbage), and they get to ride off into the sunset"}

{"text":"This is a hard-hitting movie. So real and true to life and yet so beautifully crafted. Amazing work done by the actors of the movie, especially by Irfan Khan and Tabu. Excellent direction by Mira Nair. Its like reading the novel without the book, its like living with the characters themselves. It just doesnt get better. Its thought provoking.\n\nExcellent family story of typical intergenerational communiction problems. It is not just because of cultural differences that families do not communicate well, but it does add a lot to this story. Excellent acting and plausable twists kept me interested as did the deep emotional content of the material and actors. I cared about this family and their well-being.\n\nTo its credit, \"The Namesake\"(which tops the two-hour mark), could've been a lot longer without causing anybody(who isn't a philistine) to check their watches. If a director's cut exists, that's where we'll learn how Gogol Ganguli(Kal Penn) met Maxine(Jacinda Barrett). \"The Namesake\" has a truncated feel because Gogol is already treated like a member of Maxine9;s wealthy family when the audience is first introduced to her. Perhaps the filmmaker simply wanted to avoid the predictability involved in seeing a white family adjust to their offspring's \"exotic\" new friend, if acceptance into the fold is going to be the end-result anyway. \"The Namesake\" does a terrific job of not turning Maxine into an ugly American when she's inside the Ganguli household. Contrary to Maxine(who for the most part seems unaware of her countless faux pas' to Indian customs), Gogol and his sister are consciously arrogant about their American-ness when they return to their native India. \"The Namesake\" is mostly an amazing film about being an American on a cultural group's own terms.\u2026Expand\n\nProbably the best movie out this year! Great cast, with terrific Indian scenery. The best part is the message about foreigners trying to assimilate into a new culture, and the desire to keep traditions.

{"text":"15, 2006\n\nMovie Review: United 93\n\nUnited 93 tells one of the stories of 9\/11 in an absolutely rivoting just-the-facts manner. About half the film is set in various air traffic control centers, the national FAA control center and NORAD. The other half is set aboard United 93 up until it crashes in Pennsylvania. There are a few minutes the night before as the hijackers prepare and some time spent in the airport as people board for a normal flight. I found it hard to believe this was almost 5 years ago and how different boarding a plane seems since then.\n\nThe film presents the story almost in real time. The actors are unknowns and in fact several of the people in the control centers are played by the real people who were there. That gives a lot of authenticity to the film. It's shot almost entirely at eye level and with a lot of handheld cameras to really give you the sense of being in the control room or on the plane. At some points I wanted a clock on the screen ticking away the time, but I think that would have been a constant reminder that we know what's coming.\n\nThis isn't typical Hollywood anything. There's no exposition, background stories, characterizations or even names. You know as much about the passengers as you would if you were flying with them, in other words, nothing. In other films this might eliminate the emotional impact, but when you show people calling their loved ones to say \"I love you\" just before they die, you don't need anything else. It's hard to keep a dry eye during those scenes.\n\nA few things struck me: how ordinary the start of the day was, how disorganized the response was, how no one could remember the last hijacking, and how NORAD brought up CNN for information, how no one knew who were the perpetrators or what they wanted or how much more there was to come. There are some liberties taken with what happens on the plane but they seem reasonable. Did one passenger want to do whatever the hijackers said? Probably there was one. Did the leader delay taking the plane? Maybe. Were they targeting the Capital? Probably either that or the White House. There was nothing that seemed egregious or sensationalistic.\n\nUnited 93 is completely absorbing from beginning to end. There are no political statements, just the events of that horrible morning, told as faithfully and honestly as possible. This is one of the best films of the year.\n\n1 comment:\n\nThanks for that review. I don't think I would have gone out of my way to see this movie without reading such a favorable review. Somehow my base expectation was something like one of the old Airplane movies ...or something like the old Poseidon adventure."}
{"text":"I haven't done this before. I am specifically writing a review of a movie after having read other reviews of the movies. Frankly, became annoyed at what I had read. Mulholland Drive is being called a masterpiece by a great many critics who say they enjoyed it even though they couldn't make sense of it. Does that make sense to you? It doesn't make sense to me.\n\nWhat happened along the way to becoming a seasoned movie critic? Are critics so tired of wallowing in the muck of studio rehash that they'll blindly praise anything that dares to be different, even if it's incomprehensible? I feel as though I could become a director, create a movie with strange but inviting imagery, and as long as nobody can understand it yet there are enough pieces in it for thinking viewers to try to piece together, my work will be praised. Would it really be that simple?\n\nDreamscape movies, which Mulholland Drive is, especially seem to be able to get away with this. These are the kind of movies that can hypnotize you with their imagery, indulging your senses with standout scores and cinematography, but often have little other appeal, particularly in the narrative sense. The main problem, however, with dreamscape movies is that opinions of them are entirely subjective. Yes, every opinion of a movie is subjective, but the audience's subjectivity can be second-guessed, as with, for example, a comedy, which can often be fashioned to appeal to the overlapping portions of people's different senses of humor. By contrast, dreamscapes can't second-guess; they either draw the viewer in sensually or they don't, and if they appeal to one viewer they probably do so in a much different way than they did for another. However, even if one liked such a movie, one would most likely have an impossible time making sense of it. My favorite dreamscape movie is 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I can't guarantee that it will cast a spell on you as it did on me; there's as much chance that you would find it utterly boring and its ending bewildering. Eyes Wide Shut was a movie that divided critics, but search among the praises and you'll find the same statements -- that the film's haunting dreaminess was enough to make one like it, thus one didn't feel the need to be able to explain it. Those who didn't like the movie would find that logic infuriating. The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover was another film that was labeled \"a feast for the senses,\" its atmosphere praised and its narrative deemed a political metaphor; but be in the wrong mood for it and its artsiness will feel pretentious while the rest of the movie will disgust you. The critics who enjoy these movies rate them at the top of their scale, but one filmgoer's four-star dream movie is another filmgoer's one-star incomprehensible garbage. Such ratings are totally personal because objectively a dreamscape movie is hard to defend against the criticisms of a viewer who hated it. If one asks, \"why did you enjoy it?\", the answer may truly be, \"just because it worked for me.\"\n\nMulholland Drive may or may not work for you. It makes little sense, asks that you really give it some thought, and even then you may not make sense of it. If you like it, you won't care that you can't make sense of it. It's David Lynch at his usual, filling this tv-pilot-turned-theatrical movie with eccentric characters like old ladies and old men, a midget in a body suit, a cowboy, a starlet, a hit-man, and a scary bum. Fans of Lynch will no doubt enjoy his latest movie, which is essentially more of the \"Twin Peaks\" game of throwing out a bunch of pieces to a puzzle that hold no promise of coming together at the end. To non-Lynch-fans, a warning: watch at your own risk.\n\nI did. I'm not a David Lynch fan, and I admit that I don't consistently \"get\" him. I was, however, into \"Twin Peaks,\" and, when I'm in the right mood, I like some of the things Lynch does. In Mulholland Drive, I like his usage of Angelo Badalamenti's haunting music. I liked the character of the young sardonic director (Justin Theroux), and I liked the two female leads (Laura Elena Harring as a gorgeous and mysterious amnesiac, and Naomi Watts, who shines as a Hollywood ingenue). I liked the dark humor in the scene where the hit-man's job goes a little longer than planned. I liked the intensity of the audition scene, where Watts has a chance to surprise all onlookers. And, yes, I liked the erotic lesbian sex scene (because it was surprisingly tender. Really!).\n\nI can not, however, explain the movie. The last half-hour turns everything topsy-turvy, and I slapped my forehead when the credits rolled. David Lynch had done it again. He took me for an intriguing ride, and then left me confused, angry, and annoyed. Afterwards, I did some reading about the movie, found some attempts at explanations, and alleviated my confusion and anger but not my annoyance. Certain parts of Mulholland Drive appealed to me, but as a whole it did not. Thus, I can not recommend it. The best suggestion I can give is: watch at your own risk. You'll either be satisfied with its surreal craziness, or you'll react like the audience member who got up and said, \"There's a few hours we'll never have back!\"\n\nI have great contempt for the praising of a movie without the attempt to make some sense of it, and that was why the initial love heaped upon David Lynch's Mulholland Drive ticked me off. I felt that that's what the critics had done. Add this to my own experience of watching Lynch's television series \"Twin Peaks\" and the critical drubbing of his reportedly nonsensical movie Lost Highway, and I personally wanted to write off his latest movie as a pretentious pile of garbage. I was fascinated by the theories that attempted to make sense of the story, but became even more fascinated when those theories actually revealed how skillfully Lynch was able to use what he had -- a rejected pilot for an ABC television series with no particular direction in mind -- and resolve it with a heartbreaking picture of an actress's destroyed dreams. But was this what Lynch meant to do? Or was he just being random? I read more and more about what others thought of the movie, yet I still refused to change my mind on the matter, even though I admitted to myself that there were many things I liked about the film.\n\nI've now determined that I was unfair to him. Recently I picked up an independent film magazine and read an interview with Lynch, who revealed the creative process he went through to complete Mulholland Drive. I was relieved to find out that he was indeed going for something, and that coming up with an ending to his pilot was one of the most exciting and challenging experiences he has had. It was the last straw that finally shattered my notions that this was just some pretentious auteur who had made his living by stringing audiences along with directionless stories that happened to feature great atmosphere. It is with a sigh and a smile that I upgrade my rating for this movie to a 7\/10 -- it's still not perfect, and I'll never forgive Lynch for that ludicrous final scene with the tiny old people, but I look forward to watching this movie again one day to re-experience it."}
{"text":"If you haven't noticed already, I'm a bit of an oddball in comparison to my fellow movie writers. I didn't study film in college -- I studied European history, mixed with uneven doses of journalism and English literature. But life leads you into very strange places, and because I loved movies as much as I loved history, I'm here instead of lecturing about the Black Death. Why waste all those years, though? Why not mash all of that up and publish it? Well, that's exactly what I'll be doing with Motion History.\n\nEvery week, I'm going to take a film and discuss what is fact and what is fiction. However, I feel an approach like that can be awfully negative. Everyone knows historical accuracy has never been Hollywood's strong suit (my professors spent hours complaining about Spartacus and Gladiator). But I refuse to dismiss a film just because it's inaccurate. Films have a mythological power and value, and movies like Braveheart or 300 have an effect on people and culture. There's intent behind their creation and their inaccuracies, and it's not always as simple as ticket sales. I hope to explore that angle a lot more over the course of this feature.\n\nBut enough with the introduction. Let's kick off this fledgling feature with a film that's a personal favorite, and one that's newly out on Blu-ray: Doctor Zhivago. This is a film that was responsible for my decision to abandon the Middle Ages, and spend a few semesters studying Russia. I'm not embarrassed by that. It was a fascinating foray, and exposed me to a culture I had no knowledge of beyond Rocky IV. My studies also had the added benefit of deepening my love for the film. Hopefully, today's feature will have a similar effect on you.\n\nThe Movie\n\nBased on Boris Pasternak's novel, Doctor Zhivago is the story of Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif), a poet and physician, and his love for the beautiful and tragic Lara (Julie Christie). Their great misfortune is to not only meet when they're both married, but to fall for each other in the midst of the Russian Revolution and Civil War. As one character coldly puts it, the personal life is dead in Russia, and Yuri and Lara both suffer for their determination to love and live.\n\nThe Historical Background\n\nIt comes as a surprise to a lot of people, but there were actually two Russian Revolutions in 1917. Russia had been in turmoil for years (there had been a revolution in 1905), but World War I injected enough patriotism to smooth things over. You actually see this represented in Doctor Zhivago. Revolution is brewing. People are marching in the streets, and are cut down by Cossacks. But war breaks out in 1914, and the world turns bright and shiny again -- though unrest remains in the form of the black-clad Yevgraf (Alec Guinness), who enlists purely to ferment dissent among the soldiers.\n\nThree years later, World War I was in a stalemate. A million Russian soldiers had been killed. Russian citizens were cold and starving. Revolution began when a group of anonymous women rose up on February 28, 1917* to march for bread and coal. Tsar Nicholas II abdicated four days later, and a Provisional Government was formed. Nine months of turmoil followed. The government chose to continue the war, power struggles erupted between political factions, and small committees called soviets sprung up across the country. The largest soviet was in Petrograd, and it's there that a loud political minority called the Bolsheviks set up camp. On the night of October 25, the Bolshevik Revolution took place. It was more of a coup than a revolution; there's little bloodshed, and few Russians realized it was even happening. They went to bed under the Provisional Government, woke up under the Bolsheviks, and erupted into civil war.\n\nIs The Movie Accurate?\n\nWell, yes and no. Like Pasternak's novel, the movie compresses the revolution into one tumultuous event that occurs off-screen. The aftershocks of violence and chaos reach out and sweep up Yuri and Lara, who are on the warfront and have no idea what's going on. When Yuri comes home to a stripped and sullen Moscow, it's a world he no longer recognizes. His home is gone. The politics are uncertain. Starvation and disease are rampant. This was a homecoming experienced by a lot of soldiers. The fear and confusion all the characters share is emblematic of how many Russians must have felt.\n\nAnd things only got worse! As if a war and two revolutions weren't bad enough, the country erupted into a civil war that would last until 1921. Doctor Zhivago doesn't skimp on the horror of the time. The romance may be fictional; the hollow-eyed refugees who can only whisper \"Soldiers!\" aren't.\n\nBut where Doctor Zhivago goes \"wrong\" is in its emphasis on spies, secret police, censored poetry, and The Party. As if you couldn't guess from the history above, the Bolsheviks were far too busy in 1917 to hunt dreamy dissidents like Yuri Zhivago. They were fanatics, but they actually allowed enough freedom that a poet like Zhivago (or his real-life counterpart, Pasternak) could publish their work without fear of persecution. Lev Trotsky \u2013 no choirboy pacifist -- even maintained that \"art cannot live and cannot develop without a flexible atmosphere of sympathy.\" Zhivago isn't a story about the Russian Revolution; it's a thinly disguised portrayal of the Stalin Revolution, when you could be shot, tortured, or imprisoned for having the wrong attitude. Pasternak wrote it as a reaction to the purges. It's about the political terror he experienced (including personal phone calls from Stalin himself) and the loss of his friends to firing squads and gulags. \"The novel is absolutely essential for me as a way of expressing my feelings,\" Pasternak said. \"One cannot sit with folded arms.\" The troubled poet died five years before the film was made, a death hastened by the trauma of being harassed for Zhivago and the Nobel Prize it was awarded.\n\nLean's film is as much about Pasternak as it is an adaptation of the man's work. The philosophical and religious musings of the novel are gone. Instead, the movie is a cry against censorship, oppression, cruelty, and martial law. The wolves are howling at the door, and there's spies around every corner. The Soviet imagery is a lot more vivid and evil. Yet for all that, it's a more hopeful story than Pasternak's book. The novel ends on a bloody note of World War II, with characters continuing to drift into the great, grim unknown. Lean allows for hope, reunion, and survival. His film even ventures into an unspecified point of glasnost, when the Soviet Union would openly appreciate a poet like Zhivago again. There's even a wavering, misty rainbow stretching out over that stolid Soviet dam.\n\nThese are surprisingly confident gestures considering Pasternak's novel was still unpublished in his native land, and wouldn't be until 1988. There, I suspect Lean's Doctor Zhivago is more about post-war Europe than the formation of the Soviet Union. It reminds us that what is beautiful, gentle, and personal in the world \u2013 poetry, art, a balalaika, romantic love \u2013 is only temporarily crushed by the boot heel, and that even the fragile things can rise again.\n\n*The dates given are from the Julian calendar Russia was still using at that time. It gets confusing to talk about the February and October revolutions, and then give our Gregorian dates of March 8 and November 9, respectively."}
{"text":"Miramichi\n\nUser's review\n\nThe wife and I were going to see Tangled... but the showing we wanted was sold out. So we saw this one instead... Good decision! This is a surprisingly good movie... if the film-noire school of the 40's-50's era went in for action movies, they would have been a lot like this... gritty, cynical and extremely violent, with an ambiguously motivated protagonist working against a bunch of people a whole lot worse. I was expecting a straight-up action movie, but instead got a very interesting psychological and moral journey... and LOTS of great action. I don't quite see why people are finding the story simple... the backstory is the big thing here, and details are doled out slowly, revealing exactly what needs to be revealed at exactly the right time. Everybody in this movie does great work and plays it absolutely straight... there is hardly a single corny moment, wink at the camera or gratuitous witty one-liner in the entire film. The story isn't entirely realistic... there is no way a mad-dog killer could roar around two states in a vintage muscle car blowing people away, as Driver does in this movie--but still, it works. At least it worked for me. The only think I didn't like was the camera movement (sigh) that verged on being way too much. I can see why people might not 'get' this movie... there doesn't seem to be much depth. But it's there if you bother to look for more than screeching tires and gunshots."}
{"text":"The most helpful favourable review\n\nThe most helpful critical review\n\n2 of 2 people found the following review helpful\n\n4.0 out of 5 starsSex, Lies and Saville Row....\n\n2.0 out of 5 starsa waste of film...\n more politely - in an interview broadcast around the time the movie hit the theaters.\n\nYet, on second thought, who'd have been more appropriate to play James Bond's evil twin than the latest incarnation of Bond himself? Who more appropriate to play the story's multifarious title character than the actor who shone in complex roles like David Helfgott, the Marquis de Sade and Shakespearean theater owner Philip Henslowe?\n\nGoing in, I didn't doubt that Geoffrey Rush would be an amazing Harry Pendel - the role of the seemingly pathetic antihero, the little man desperately trying to maintain his dignity in the face of overwhelming odds fits him like a glove; and he does indeed give a bravura, almost Chaplinesque performance. The greater surprise for me was Pierce Brosnan, who takes every single Bond cliche and merrily runs with it in the opposite direction: I confess this took some getting used to, but once I'd gotten into the swing of it, I enormously enjoyed his skill and courage in deconstructing the very image on which his fame is grounded.\n\nBrosnan is Andy Osnard, an MI6 agent sent to Panama as a punishment for having stepped on one toe to many during his last posting. He isn't exactly enthusiastic about the assignment to what he views as a seedy tropical backwater, but his superiors tell him that he's there to safeguard British interests in the wake of the Panama Canal's turnover to the Panamanian government after General Noriega's ouster. Generating leads in preparation for his arrival, Osnard comes across the name of Harry Pendel, a tailor billing himself as one half of \"Pendel and Braithwaite,\" ostensibly an enterprise in the venerable Saville Row tradition, founded by now-deceased Arthur Braithwaite. But the shop's alleged provenance is as big a fabrication as Harry's personal history; for in fact, he learned tailoring in prison, where he was sent for burning down his Uncle Benny (Harold Pinter)'s shop. Discovering this - and the fact that Harry used to be Noriega's tailor and is still very much in favor with the currently reigning clique (the same people already in power under Noriega: \"They got Ali Baba but missed the 40 slaves,\" Harry comments) - Osnard quickly decides that Harry Pendel is the weakest link in the British expat community; the perfect guy to lean on and generate intelligence.\n\nSoon Harry is trapped between the growing pressure exercised by Osnard, his considerable financial needs (which Osnard has promised to remedy) and the admonitions of his faux conscience Uncle Benny never to tell the truth, the only thing that can really hurt him: \"Try sincerity, that's a virtue\" Uncle Benny advises - \"truth is an affliction.\" And so Harry spins lie after lie; constructing a mesh in which he is ultimately caught together with his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis in one of her best-ever performances) and closest friends Micky Abraxas (an almost unrecognizable Brendan Gleeson) and Marta (Leonor Varela), who have barely survived Noriega's regime - Micky broken in spirit, Marta with a perpetually scarred face. Because Harry's lies about a \"silent opposition\" network and alleged plans to sell the Panama Canal to the Chinese are good enough to eventually prompt the British *and* American governments to plan a new invasion - and with that prospect looming large over Panama City's infamous \"cocaine towers\" skyline, the Pendel family, Micky and Marta find themselves in an almost inescapable stranglehold.\n\nAlthough written by one of the great masters of the spy thriller genre and despite a plot featuring all the trademark elements, \"The Tailor of Panama\" is *not* a thriller but a farce; as much parody of the genre as mordant satire on the intelligence community (which le Carre knows intimately from personal experience) and sharp criticism of the first world's exploitation of the corrupt power structures of strategically located, cash-strapped countries in the developing world. References to both \"Casablanca\" and Graham Greene's \"Our Man in Havana\" are deliberate; obviously so in its setting and in the satirical creation of a would-be spy spinning a web of lies just to keep the cash coming in and eventually caught in that web when his lies come true; but also in Harry's reference to Panama as \"Casablanca without heroes,\" and when Osnard, taken to a small plane by a British diplomat, wonders aloud whether this could be \"the beginning of a beautiful friendship\" (\"I think it desperately unlikely,\" is the icy response).\n\nThe movie seems to be particularly unpopular with two groups: Brosnan fans disappointed not to see him play another superhero like James Bond and Remington Steele (and there's little to be said about this; you either buy into his deconstruction of that image or you don't) and Panamanians alienated by their country's portrayal as a corrupt banana republic. I admittedly haven't been to Panama (yet); and I'm sure it has more to offer than corruption, cocaine and the colorful, seedy nightlife so amply displayed here. But Panama's history is a troubled one, and the ongoing role of the Western powers (particularly the U.S.) in its politics is problematic; so I do think le Carre and Boorman have a legitimate point.\n\nIn sum, this is a fine production, featuring great performances from its entire cast (also including Catherine McCormack as the career diplomat who becomes Osnard's love - err, sex - interest and Daniel Radcliffe, now of \"Harry Potter\" fame, as Pendel's son) and spellbinding cinematography by Philippe Rousselot, making Panama's lush, tropical setting come to life in all its vibrant facets. Don't be discouraged by the naysayers ... take a look and judge for yourself!\n at once, and we also had a few local actors in the movie as well so it was fun, but when the movie started, basically it was a little weird, what a waste of talent i mean brosnan character turns out to be a wise guy who's only interested in two things money and sex, nothing compared to his roll as mr. bond. rush's performance wasn't bad but it could have been way better as for the other players, well i'll say a regular outcoming. Another thing that bothered me is WHY everytime somebody makes a movie in another country other than USA always shows the \"poor side\" or the b side of that particular place, hey i know my country has its highs and lows but for some reason they always showed the low ones, we are more than just a little village or in this movie's case a lost city!!. but anyway the movie could have been way better than it did, the only fun thing about it is that you actually see the buildings and landscape that we are used to.\n\nGeoffrey Rush is excellent as Harry, an Englishman with a sadly shady past who has re- invented himself in Panama as the best tailor in the country, making clothes for the rich and politically powerful. Into his world comes Osnard, played by Pierce Brosnan. A morally corrupt, self-serving MI6 spy, sent to Panama as a last chance after seducing a European diplomat's wife.\n\nMany were bowled over by the irony of casting Brosnan, so associated with James Bond, as this much realer, creepier Bond alter ego. A man who is handsome, and self-confident, but whose endless seduction of women seems smarmy not sexy, and who delights in screwing other people while profiting himself.\n\nFor me the casting was actually problematic. Brosnon's terrific, but the irony is so distractingly obvious, that it pulled me out of the story, and made me think too much about film and our hero images instead of simply accepting the character. Beyond that, Osnard is drawn a little too broadly for my taste. He's so transparent, I have a hard time he gets anyone to trust him even for a moment. If his inner self-serving pig were a bit better hidden, it might have given the audience more to unravel, and make other characters' willingness to do his bidding a bit easier to buy.\n\nThe mix of tones also was a bit of a misfire for me. Never quite darkly funny enough to ascend into true satire, but certainly never edgy enough to be taken seriously, there's a lack of danger here. Unlike 'Dr. Strangelove', we never really think Harry and Osnard's games will reduce Panama to a pile of rubble, and the intimation of it seems false and a bit silly.\n\nYet, all that complaining is because the movie is good enough, smart enough, brave enough and entertaining enough that I felt frustrated it didn't quite work as brilliantly as is should. But I'd certainly still recommend it, in spite of my long winded misgivings, and I'm also willing to give it another look.\n\nThis movie presents a different story altogether than the one LeCarre wrote. The plot line of Harry and Marta was not the unspoken love story of the book, and the ending in no way resembled LeCarre's tale. The verbally explosive scene at the tailor shop makes Harry the one who gets upset, rather than Mickey (via Harry's humiliation of him), giving Mickey's suicide a different motivation entirely. The episode where Harry moves Mickey's body and cleans up Mickey's apartment is left out. Louisa is given an alternate personality more suitable to Jamie Lee Curtis. Don't waste your time and money--read the book. Better yet, listen to The John LeCarre Collection audio. Let LeCarre tell the story himself--he does so wonderfully.\n\n4.0 out of 5 starsA spy flick with a different angle and a streak of humor., May 17 2004\n\nBy A Customer\n\nThis review is from: The Tailor of Panama (Special Edition) (DVD)\n\nThis movie is the opposite of the Bond movies. This is not a showcase of the smooth or sophisticated. Most of the characters are seedy. They are generally examples of pride, greed, incompetence, and power mongering. However they are likeable and understandable in their own twisted ways. I am not suggesting that you'll like everything they do. Yet I found myself hoping for a happy ending for the primary characters. (I won't spoil it for you.) Also there is some great humor. I laughed at the vibrating bed scene. A must-see for a fresh look.\n\nAs a great fan of Le Carr\u00e9 I was very disappointed with the ending of this movie. I had hoped that the alternative ending was better, but it wasn't. Pierce Brosnan was good, though I had imagined that the actor was more like a Michael Caine-type. I don't think that Jamie Lee Curtis was the best for that part - at least not with Geoffrey Rush as her husband. However he was a perfect taylor.\n\nMy spouse and I stopped watching this film about one half way through it. For me, Brosnan, is never believeable in the characters that he plays. My wife liked him as Remington Steele but I could not stomach him. I thought he did his recent Robinson Crusoe role alright. Here in \"Tailor\" he seems to project the correct image here, but his character really is not likeable. Besides that, I can't figure out where this movie fails. If it was any good, I could also excuse the face of the tailor's \"conscience\" that periodically flashes on the screen and speaks. Unless this film rescues itself in the second half, I don't recommend it. Certainly don't buy it.\n\nThe Tailor of Panama is an excellent and entertaining film. Both actors Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush bring a great sense of enjoyment to their characters. Mr. Brosnan brings a great sense of wickedness to his character Andy Osnard. Mr. Rush brings a great sense of naivetivity and at deception to his character Harry Pendel. When Harry begins to spin his lies to Osnard both men know what's going on.But they allow each other to keep going just to see were everything leads to. I really liked the ending of the film. I also enjoyed the way it was filmed the scenery of Panama is breathtaking and the music adds a sense of mystery and excotic feelings. Also the story is very interesing. Although at times the movie kinda drags along it is overall very enjoyable. I really liked this film and I think it's a very enjoyable movie.\n\nSummary: Andrew 'Andy' Osnard (Pierce Brosnan), an MI5 agent who has a tendency to 'screw' up missions despite being very good at getting information out of people (usually through sleeping with them), has been reassigned to Panama to help the British government determine the fate of the Panama Canal, which was recently returned to the ownership and direction of Panama. Andy hooks up with Harold 'Harry' Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), who is a tailor, mostly by digging up his true history as a criminal. Andy then uses this history (really the threat of making the history public), as well as a series of bribes, to get Harry to talk about all of his clients, which includes just about every major politician and businessman in Panama.\n\nHowever, Harry, who really is just a tailor, can't handle the pressure. He cracks and begins feeding Andy lies, a response to pressure he apparently developed in jail. As Andy continues to pressure him Harry's lies grow to ever-increasing proportions until it appears that Panama is about to sell the Canal to China, which obviously the U.S. and the U.K. aren't going to allow. Of course Andy is aware that what Harry is telling him are a bunch of lies, but he goes along with it, claiming to his boss that the rebel group that is hoping to regain control of the Canal before it can be sold, 'The Silent Opposition', just needs $15 million to successfully stage a coup.\n\nWhen the alleged opposition group leader is found dead the U.S. deems this a worthy reason to believe that everything is collapsing. The result - send in the troops. Just before the troops get there Andy snatches the money, pays a couple of quick bribes, and hightails it out of Panama, leaving Harry, and his wife, Louisa (Jamie Lee Curtis), who works for a major government official, to try to stop the impending invasion.\n\nMy Comments: Other than decent acting by Geoffrey Rush and Jamie Lee Curtis, this is a horrible movie. Why? First, even though the combination of James Bond with 'Wag the Dog' is kind of unique, it's really pretty obvious that that is really all the movie is, a combination of plot devices that have been done (and much better I might add). A spy creates a scenario in which major world powers feel the need to go to war. Perhaps it is a decent premise, but when you consider it in light of the next criticism, it just doesn't work.\n\nMy second major problem with the movie are the motivations, or lack thereof, of the characters. Sure, Andy is greedy, but that doesn't explain why he is willing to destroy so many people's lives by starting a war in Panama. Is there a motivation beyond his penile urges and his greed? Or is he really such a shallow character that he is just driven by greed and sex? And what about Harry? Why is he investing in farms? He's a tailor, and a successful one at that. Why does he resort to lying? The stated reason, that this is his defense mechanism learned while in jail, is pretty silly. The problems with the motivations of the characters makes them all very unconvincing and shallow. Even the attempts at backstory - flashbacks to the Manuel Noriega days - don't add much depth to Harry's character.\n\nThe third problem is the limitless, gratuitous sex. Andy's affair with the embassy aide Francesca Deane (Catherine McCormack) is just that - sex. There must be 20 minutes of Andy and Francesca engaged in violent sex and for what? Nothing. He doesn't learn anything from her, he just has sex with her, over and over again. It doesn't advance the story in anyway. Andy also tries hitting on Louisa and even takes Harry to a gay bar. Maybe the director and producers realized that they didn't have a very good story so they opted for a mild porn ambience to sell this film. Whatever the reason, it can only be considered gratuitous.\n\nAdd these problems to the other major story holes and you have a very forgettable movie. What happened to the U.S. intelligence? Why do they not back anything up with their own people? What about calling the president of the country? Where did Harry get the 'spy phone'? Why would Harry think his wife's papers he photographs are of any importance? And on, and on, and on...\n\nThe political overtones to the movie are also kind of silly with the military being rampant warmongers that just want to kill, kill, kill; the politicians are all corrupt, etc.\n\nOverall this is really just a silly story with a lot of sex to try to compensate for it. The acting is mediocre, at best, and none of the characters are believable. It just doesn't work as a convincing film. Not recommended."}

Instead of a pretty nurse soothing the story from a war ravaged old spy, we have a daughter, Marie, seeking to understand her stoic mother Esther's past.

Mischa Barton shines as a raw beauty, playing the young Esther of the 1940s; while Shirley MacLaine brings a fitting strength to the current-day closed-hearted Esther.

{"text":"A lot of interesting parts (hardy har, you clowns) but I'm not sure if they necessarily make up a cohesive film. And does that even matter? It absolutely gets its point across and it's an effective film in basically every aspect - the mood, the tone, the score, the cinematography, the performances, the direction and the long takes. It almost feels punishing to watch by the end of it, so I say job well done.\n\nA brilliant film that uniquely explores the ends of a man's addiction to sex that get's abruptly interrupted when his sister turns up to stay unexpectedly.\n\nThe film visualises long periods without dialogue and extensively long singular shot-types that helps convey the main character's frustration with his special addiction, and more importantly how he copes with it.\n\nCarey Mulligan puts on a great performance in the supporting role of the sister. She also proves that she has a beautiful signing voice in this film, in-fact a great one. Very talented.\n\nShame is one of those films that you don't really want to watch with other people. Mainly because of the subject matter, which in this case is sex addiction.

{"text":"Today I watched the 2005 film Green Street Hooligans starring Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam, and directed by Lexi Alexander. Elijah Wood is Matt Buckner, a journalism student at Harvard. Unfortunately, as the movie begins, we see he has just been expelled for something he didn't even do. His wealthy roommate did. Unfortunately, Buckner takes the fall, fearing the wealth and power of his roommates family, he doesn't even stand up for himself. He travels to England to visit his sister, whom he hasn't seen in some time.\n\nUpon his arrival in England, Buckner soon meets his brother-in-law's brother, Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam), the leader of a group of football (soccer) hooligans cheering on West Ham United FC. The group is known as the Green Street Elite, more commonly referred to in the film as GSE. Buckner quickly becomes embroiled in the controversy and fighting you would expect from a group of hooligans.\n\nBut there is more to the Green Street Elite than simply fighting against the hooligans of the opposing football teams on match day. It is about camaraderie, standing up for your friends, and knowing that your friends will stand up for you. The hooliganism portrayed in the film seems to be at least partially realistic to British football hooliganism, as the story was written by Dougie Brimson, a former football hooligan himself who has written several books on the topic.\n\nIf you don't enjoy violence, then this isn't the film for you. If you have a really difficult time understand British accents, then this isn't the film for you. But if you enjoy well-made films featuring real life struggles, then this film is simply fantastic. You wouldn't think you could learn a lot about yourself hanging out with football hooligans, but you'd be wrong. I highly recommend you check it out.\n\nMatt's Rating: farther"}
{"text":"The Decalogue (1989) Episode 5\n\nThe Decalogue 5\n\nSpoilers occur about the ending, this review is intended for those who have already watched the film.\n\nSummary:\nTakes place during a day in Warszawa. Piotr, a lawyer fresh out of school has just finished his studies and is just starting out his career. A taxi driver washes his car. A young man named Jacek from the provinces is aimlessly drifting around the streets. Under strange circumstances, all three of them will get to know each other. The young man is restless and sullen, and it seems like he easily gets in a bad mood. At one point he takes a taxi, requests to be driven to a remote area, and murders the driver for no apparent reason. It seems Jacek is almost asking to be caught, because he leaves his finger prints all over the crime scene.\nPiotr takes on the job as Jacek's attorney and becomes aware that the young lad never recovered from his sister's death, and that Jacek feels partly responsible for her passing. He is not yet 20-years-old, but the judge shows no mercy and sentences Jacek to the death penalty. A pardon is refused, the young man is to be hanged. The lawyer believes a new crime is being added to the first crime by killing Jacek. Piotr is convinced that crimes are not prevented by using the death penalty.\n\nAnalysis and interpretation:\nFavorite quote: \"Since the days of Cain, no punishment has proved to be an adequate deterrent\"\n\nThe main theme is the death penalty, and whether it should be used. Initially I thought the lawyer was the older version of the younger man, turns out I was wrong about that. The scenes of the lawyer are intercut with Jacek's journey, so there is a feeling of a consequence to everything Jacek does.\n\nJacek is alone in the city and seems alienated from his surroundings, the sad classical music adds to this feeling. He appears to have not had enough love during his childhood, he loved his little sister, and Jacek was her favorite too. Perhaps the parents were uncaring. We notice that Jacek's mother did not have a kind word to say to him before the hanging. She indirectly acknowledges that he should be hanged, and hanging is the price he must pay.\n\nAs blogger Deciphering The Decalogue writes: Jacek is a person who has been emotionally stunted possibly from abandonment, and was likely not taught during his upbringing how to control the evil inside him.\nThis however does not excuse what he has done, but merely is a factor in his behavior. We can empathize with his isolation and possible lack of parental guidance.\n\nPiotr, the defense lawyer, in a way steps in and becomes a father figure for Jacek in the absence of his parents. Jacek senses the warmth Piotr is offering, and wholeheartedly accepts it with open arms. Perhaps it's the first time the boy has ever felt a father's love.\n\nThe commandment, you shall not murder, was originally an attempt to reduce acts of revenge. But what is the death penalty, is it just a modern day revenge action?\n\nKieslowski: \"The film was an accusation against violence. To cause somebody's death is the highest form of violence, you can imagine; the death penalty is to cause someone's death. In that way there is a link between violence and the death penalty, and the film is against the death sentence as a kind of violence.\"\n\nThe director makes us feel empathy for the killer, so we are on Piotr's side, and against the executioners. We wonder, as Piotr does, is there not an alternative for Jacek, can he be cured over time? Or is Piotr simply too forgiving and soft?\n\nAs SJHoneywell notes in his review, why does the state have rights to murder, that the individual does not?\n\nandrewsidea interprets the final moments of the episode: \"a film and is invisible to the characters but visible to the viewers. Though Kieslowski allows those within the film to despair, he suggests to the audience that despair isn't the only option.\"\n\nKieslowski: \"Actually there is not much to say about the story, because we don't know why he kills the taxi driver.\"\n\nKieslowski: \"We are in Warszawa. The city and the surrounding are represented in a particular way. The cameraman on this film, Slawek Idziak, utilized specific filters. Green filters, so the films colour is more green than otherwise. Green is presumed to be the colour of spring, the colour of hope, but if you put green filters on the camera, the world seems more brutal, bleak, and empty. Everything was recorded with filters, it was the camera man's idea.\"\n\nVerdict:\nA powerful and violent episode, that stays with you. The performances are also very good. We feel we are in Jacek's shoes, like when we followed Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976), or The Jackal in The Day of the Jackal (1973).\nThe atmosphere and look of episode 5 creates a distorted reality that reflects Jacek's bleak and empty life. The filters on the camera foreshadow Kieslowski's The Double Life of Veronique (1991).\nThe script presents the good and the bad sides of two of the main characters, whom are not simply evil, or only good. There are no easy explanations to what makes these characters do what they do, and we must draw our own conclusions. Unlike artificial and exaggerated violence in big action movies, The Decalogue Episode 5 is very realistic and uncomfortable in its depiction of a crime, and maybe this is why it is more frightening, because it could happen in our neighborhood. Episode 5 was also released in a longer version in cinemas.\n\nNext time, I'll look at Episode 6. Readers of this review, any thoughts on Episode 5?\n\n@SJHoneywell: Even though Kieslowski has taken a standpoint against violence(see above quote), Episode 5 still leaves the question of the death sentence open to debate. Also the matter of why do people kill is open-ended.\n\nNice write up Chris. I saw the full length version of this. My understanding is that we get to see a little bit more backstory with the lawyer and the taxi driver (who is a bit of an asshole). Also at the end Piotr doesn't say anything in the field. We just see him crying. I believe that quote that you liked was from Karl Marx. It was a clever little poke at the communist state at the time.\n\n@Mark: Thanks for reading! Agree about the taxi driver. Could indeed be a poke at the communist state, but I think also a universal critique of the death sentence.\n\nYes, more back story in the longer version. Also when Jacek drives to see his girlfriend and tries to convince her to take off into the mountains with him, I don't remember that part in the tv-version.(been a while since viewing of cinema version so don't hold me to it)"}
{"text":"It was one of the great scandals of the 18th century: Johann Friedrich Struensee, the German physician at court in Denmark, seduced Queen Caroline Matilda and tried to seize power from King Christian VII, hoping to bring Enlightenment ideals to the Danish people. Nikolaj Arcel, the co-writer of the Swedish The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movie, has turned the story into a sweeping historical drama. A Royal Affair, starring Mads Mikkelsen and Alicia Vikander, won awards at Berlin for best script and best actor (for Mikkel F\u00f8lsgaard as King Christian).\n\nStephen Applebaum: How important is this story to Danes?\n\nNikolaj Arcel: It's very important. It's part of our cultural identity. We learn about it in school, we read about it in books, we see the ballets and the plays. It's not only politically interesting but also a very soapy, melodramatic, saucy story. There's death and birth and forbidden love. It's like a fairy tale.\n\nApplebaum: Struensee tries to bring the Enlightenment to Denmark with only the Queen's help. Why doesn't he forge more alliances?\n\nArcel: He was a political amateur. He didn't know about what you needed to stay in power, and he did all the wrong things. He went to bed with the King's wife. He cut the military, which is the main thing you should not do. And he took the money from the nobility and the rich. He felt he could implement these grand ideas, thinking, \"Of course everyone will love me for it because they can see that it's good for them.\" He was a little bit like Obama.\n\nApplebaum: Lars von Trier is one of your executive producers. How involved was he?\n\nArcel: He was not there on the set; that would have been horrible. Everybody would have been wondering, \"What does Lars think?\" No, he would read various stages of the script and tell me what he thought and bring me ideas. Then he came into the editing room several times.\n\nApplebaum: What traps did you hope to avoid?\n\nArcel: A lot of directors who do historical films fall in love with their ability to show everything. \"Let's slowly move in on the castle for 10 minutes while I show you how big a director I am.\" I am always bored with these films. But obviously I do sometimes fall into the trap.\n\nApplebaum: Were you surprised by the international success of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and how did you feel about the Fincher version?\n\nArcel: I wasn't surprised by it at all. The book was a big hit, and Noomi [Rapace, who played Lisbeth Salander] is fantastic, so we already had a good basis. I haven't seen the Fincher version. I am a big Fincher fan, and I am scared of watching it.

It tells the story of Guido, a director desperately trying to find inspiration for his latest film but being haunted by the women of his past and present. As he did with Chicago, Marshall films the musical numbers as fantasies of the protagonist, and this is one area that's a little confusing. How could someone who's struggling to find inspiration and creativity imagine such extravagant and wonderful musical numbers? Though that is a gripe of mine, those numbers are effectively done, particularly Fergie's \"Be Italian\" and Kate Hudson's \"Cinema Italiano\".

{"text":"Untitled\n\n@ Stephen. The acting is not the best? C'mon. The performances are a part of why it's so great.\n\nSWEETIE, from the first scene, plays ecstatically like a droll pop art exercise in cahoots with the bold, funny, painful, maniacal, and turly alive moments that Tennessee Williams and Peter Kennedy Toole would've come up with had they taken hold of the camera. If I were to nominate someone to make CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES into a movie it would be Jane Campion.\n\nI love this movie because the dialogue is non-stop funny, because a woman talks about tantric sex with an \"mhm\" at the end of each sentence, because the dad drives off a ranch at full speed to later park and kick a tree stump, because Louie meditates wrapped in a blanket, because Sweetie has sex with a funny little druggie, and because the ending is one of the most distinctive way of saying: \"You've just seen a movie by a true original.\"\n\nI can't stop thinking about this movie. I don't think I've ever connected with a style or story or characterization in the way I have with Jane Campion's movie. SWEETIE is very radical and tender and poetic and it's only her first movie! It's as bold and original and immediately arresting a film as Lynch's BLUE VELVET, Wong Kar Wai's CHUNGKING EXPRESS, Tarr's WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES, and Aronofsky's PI. There are other masterpieces like the aforementioned that have surely slapped me into attention and clawed into my noodles but nothing like this, it's like love, and now that I've found it, I wonder where she's been all along."}

{"text":"For me, this was a movie that did what movies are supposed to do, offer up a story that allows for a couple hours of complete absorption, a mini-vacation of a sort. The story gets off to a roller coaster start, a short ride up the first hill to happiness, and then it's dropping off the other side into total uncertainty.\n\nThe Vow\n\nLeo and Paige are two people you can't help but want the best for. As guys go, Leo(Channing Tatum) is a good one. Once Paige(Rachel McAdams) snags his heart, it's clear he's hers for life. His love for her is so earnest and convincing that he's easy for us to love.\n\nPaige's struggle with what has happened to her(trying not to give away the story here!) makes her a little less sympathetic at times, but not enough so to make us question why Leo still loves her.\n\nThe most outstanding scene in the movie for me was the one in which Jessica Lange who play's Paige's mother, explains to her daughter why she stayed with Paige's father after he had an affair with one of Paige's friends. Lange's explanation is riveting, and this was the part of the story that made me cry.\n\nAgain, without giving away the plot, it was nice to leave the theatre feeling hopeful instead of hopeless. If you're looking for a good love story to lose yourself in, go see The Vow. I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"8 1\/2 (Classic Film Pick)\n\nFederico Fellini 's \"8 1\/2\" (made in 1963) is an act of artistic desperation. \"8 1\/2\" ensured the great Italian filmmaker's permanent departure from the neo-realist style that made up his previous films, including his most recent departure from traditional narrative structure \"La Dolce Vita\" (1960). Fellini had mastered narrative drama and wanted to challenge himself as a filmmaker. But he went to his modernist destiny confused, kicking and dancing the whole way, just as his simplified alter-ego Marcelo Mastroianni does as Guido Anselmi. Guido is a hugely popular filmmaker with whom everyone wants to be associated. Producers, mistresses, crew members, actors, family members, and friends all want to possess Guido or at least to snatch a piece of his talent. The best way for them to do so is to be associated with the film he is currently making. Indeed, the movie is as much about them as it is about Fellini's own obsessions. The enigmatic director's thematic goal is to mirror on a grand scale every aspect of his own soul that he can touch or project. Guido engages in a journey of self that necessarily includes his splintered fantasy visions of female archetypes that he will use and discard as his whims dictate.\n\nFilmed almost entirely on artificial sets, \"8 1\/2\" is a pure look inside the mind of a director's cinematic exploration during a midlife crisis. Its title expresses the film's position as an in-between movie made on the way to Fellini's ninth feature \"Juliet of the Spirits.\" The original title was \"La Bella Confusione\" (\"The Beautiful Confusion\"). However, Fellini strikes at a hotter brand of bewilderment with a title that led some would-be audiences to think it represented pornography. It is rather a dynamic celebration of Fellini's miraculous methods of creating cinematic magic from the fabric of his personal dreams, desires, experiences, and relationship to Italian culture. This is a movie you can return to again and again, and still discover new meanings and messages."}
{"text":"Transylvania\n\nLike Tony Gatlif's previous outing Exiles, Transylvania comes as close as you possibly can to a plot without actually having one. In a ragbag, mashed up story, pretty Zingarina (Argento) travels to Romania with her buddy (Casar) and translator (Alendra Beoujard) to find the father of her unborn child, a musician called Milan (Costoldi). However, Milan wants nothing to do with her, which sends the broken-hearted Zingarina into a head spin and she dumps her companions. Picked up by travelling trader Tchangalo (Unel), the two embark on a road trip deep into the hinterland of Romania. Because the story is barely there, it's the characters that are front and centre and while Argento and Unel deliver sound performances, nothing much happens to them, and boredom soon creeps in. The usual Gatlif themes are present in Transylvania: the aforementioned plotless momentum (which Gatlif might argue is 'narrative space'), characters who are swallowed up by alien cultures, a bleak and desolate landscape and the massive part indigenous music plays. Gatlif is to be praised for not imposing\/jamming scriptwriting rules, that result in the majority of releases seem formulaic, into his films but his deliberate shunning of story principles sometimes feels like he's throwing the toys out of the cot"}

{"text":"Malcolm X\n\nPublisher:\n\nBringing The Autobiography Of Malcolm X to the screen had been Spike Lee's dream project since college, and it was an ideal project for the director of 1989's Do The Right Thing, an incendiary statement on contemporary race relations. So when he discovered that Warner Brothers was setting up the film for Norman Jewison, the earnest studio hand behind A Soldier's Story and Fiddler On The Roof, Lee issued the provocative response that only a black person could direct the film. The studio (and Jewison) eventually agreed and allowed Lee to take over the epic endeavor, but for all the controversy stirred up prior to its release, Malcolm X doesn't seem substantially different from something Jewison might have done. Though it's a handsome, powerful biopic\u2014faithful to the letter if not the spirit of its source material\u2014the film still seems like a failure of nerve, a gentle homage to one of recent history's most galvanizing figures.\n\nLee spends most of his rhetorical currency in the opening credits, a charged montage sequence that runs Malcolm's sharp-tongued sound bites over images of the Rodney King beating and an American flag burning into an X. But after bringing his words into the here and now, Lee settles into a stately, absorbing treatment of X's long spiritual and political awakening, and his eventual growth into a fearsome leader. Utterly convincing in the varied stages of his life, Denzel Washington makes X's transformation seem like the natural evolution of a proud, stubborn rebel who was strengthened and humbled by God's truth. Known as \"Detroit Red\" in the late '40s, X ran numbers and drugs for a Harlem crime boss (Delroy Lindo), cavorted with white women, and eventually landed a prison sentence for a string of burglary convictions. While in jail, he found religion and wholly devoted himself to the Black Muslim movement under Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman, Jr.), who framed his people's disenfranchisement and oppression in stark, empowering terms. Once X was freed, his powerful voice made him a controversial figure in the movement and the ongoing civil-rights struggle, leading to a rift with Muhammad that eventually cost him his life.\n\nNothing is out of place in Malcolm X: Lee patiently reveals each logical step in Malcolm's unlikely ascendancy, handles his courtship and marriage to Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) with disarming tenderness, and evokes three turbulent decades with a scrupulous eye for detail. And yet the force of X's message remains oddly muted, perhaps because the biopic genre demands more of an emphasis on its subject than on what its subject represents. Given Malcolm X's volatile personal history, a true portrait of the man shouldn't be so unimpeachable, since his ideas still carried enough of a charge to alarm studio heads and social commentators long before the film was released. It turns out they had nothing to fear.\n\nA 30-minute documentary produced exclusively for the new Malcolm X DVD shows unusual candor in detailing Lee's behind-the-scenes battles with the studio and the bond company. Following Francis Ford Coppola's advice to \"get the movie company pregnant\"\u2014meaning get far enough along in production to keep the studio from aborting\u2014Lee exceeded an unrealistically stingy budget and was actually shut down in postproduction. The film only got back on track and won the support of its wary studio after the intervention of moneyed black friends like Bill Cosby, Oprah Winfrey, and Michael Jordan. In a way, the making of Malcolm X probably says more about the state of contemporary race relations than the movie itself."}

{"text":"Review: This Must Be The Place\n\nNOTE: This review originally ran January 24th as part of our Sundance 2012 coverage.\n\nPLOT: When his father dies, a washed-up eighties pop star named Cheyenne (Sean Penn) leaves his Dublin estate, and his thoughtful wife (Frances McDormand) to travel to America and bury his estranged dad. Once there, he learns that his father, a Holocaust victim, was obsessed with tracking down the Nazi who tortured him at Auschwitz, leading Cheyenne to pick up the trail.\n\nREVIEW: I'm not going to mince words. THIS MUST BE THE PLACE is a real train-wreck. I suspected as much after it's cool Cannes reception, but the participation of Penn, not to mention director Paolo Sorrentino (IL DIVO) made me want to give this the benefit of the doubt. Sadly, despite a strong visual style and an excellent soundtrack by David Byrne (it's named after the hit by The Talking Heads) and Will Oldham, THIS MUST BE THE PLACE is a mess and a half.\n\nThe idea of casting Penn as a washed up, eighties pop star isn't a bad one, as Penn seems game to poke a bit of fun at himself. However, the character is such a caricature, with his look being obviously patterned after Robert Smith of The Cure, and his nasally, grating voice resembling Andy Warhol (Penn never sings), he's pretty damn hard to identify with.\n\nThe absolute randomness of the plot doesn't help things either. The Nazi subplot doesn't happen until about forty-five minutes in, and even then it's just an excuse to motivate Penn's character to embark on a very- PARIS, TEXAS style roadtrip (with Harry Dean Stanton even popping up for a cameo). It's mostly just a meandering series of episodes where Cheyenne ingratiates himself into the lives of random characters, including a waitress and her son, a Nazi Hunter (Judd Hirsch) and a retired school teacher, who was once married to the Nazi he's tracking down. None of the episodes are particularly intertesting, and Penn's appeal wears very thin early on.\n\nSorrentino's heavy-handedness doesn't really help much, with it being so blunt as to have Penn's character literally pull baggage around throughout the film- just in case we don't get the fact that yes, his character has baggage.\n\nThe only person here who escapes with their dignity intact is Frances McDormand as Penn's sensible wife, although she's maybe too normal, as it doesn't seem believable that such a sane person would be able to put up with someone as crazy as Penn is throughout.\n\nThat said, bad as it is, I never had the urge to walk out- as it was such a train-wreck that I just had to see where it would eventually end up going. The resolution is as empty and wrong-headed as any I've seen in recent movies, but considering the insanity of the rest of the film, it's probably appropriate. Bad as it is, it's never dull, which I suppose is faint praise, but praise nonetheless. Still, I urge everyone pass on this- unless you're a devotee of eccentric cinema.\n\nI just watched the trailer again and.....I am still going to give it a chance..."}
{"text":"Circumstance (Cinema)\n\nThe second half moves into slightly different territory as Atafeh's ex-drug addict brother Mehran begin to become more central to proceedings. Since his wild days he's dedicated himself to Islam and become increasingly extreme and supportive of the controlling aspects of the Iranian regime, even going as far as installing cameras to spy on his family. As Mehran makes moves to wed Shireen \u2013 whose family is keen to marry her off \u2013 the shackles of life in an oppressive, authoritarian system begin to close in on the girls. It's not all misery though, as there are some nice moments of humour, including the girls and their gay friends deciding to try and make a statement about human rights by translating Gus Van Sant's Milk into Persian for an Iranian audience.\n\nCircumstance is a brave and complex film from first-time writer\/director Maryam Keshavarz, who was born in NYC but raised in both the US and Iran. It's a film that's full of nice touches and has a bold often involving story to tell. It does have a few problems though. Keshavarz wants to cover a lot of thematic ground, such as the place of women in Iran, homosexuality, the clash between freedom and religion, the oppression felt from the sense of being watched and various other things.\n\nHowever the script sometimes has difficulty wrangling all these things and particularly in the second half, things get a bit messy as it stretches in directions that don't feel quite in keeping with what's gone before. You can tell why Keshavarz wanted to keep these things, as individually they are quite interesting and reflect aspects of the involved and fairly deep things she wants to say, but it does mean the movie is occasionally unwieldy and feels closer to melodrama than perhaps it should.\n\nSome have also criticised the movie for perpetuating stereotypes about Iran and the oppression of women and gay people in the country. To be honest I can't tell you whether Circumstance is true to what it's like to grow up in Iran, but it doesn't feel like it's selling you something completely fake. Indeed, there's a strong sense of people being the same wherever they come from, with the difference largely down to the society they have to exist within.\n\nOverall Verdict: An interesting debut from writer\/director Maryam Keshavarz exploring all sorts of ideas about life in Iran, and trying to find a sense of freedom and individuality in a controlling society."}

{"text":"Why do film-makers keep coming back to Jane Eyre? Charlotte Bronte's story has elements of horror, mystery, revenge, romance, and morality, but it is an internal narrative, Jane's own clear-eyed but personal view of her story (\"Reader, I married him.\") And yet, it is such a perennial favorite that this is at least the ninth (at least and so far) English-language cinematic visit to the wild moors and the wilder hearts of Jane Eyre. And that is not counting the many, many variations and spin-offs, including a book and movie that tell the same story from the perspective of another character.\n\nJane Eyre is an orphan, raised under the cruelest circumstances by her aunt (Sally Hawkins). Her spirit and integrity are such an affront to the aunt that she is sent away to a charity school called Lowood, where the girls are treated with contempt. She makes one true, loving friend, a girl named Helen, who ties of consumption in Jane's arms. When she finishes at Lowood, Jane (Mia Wasikowska of \"The Kids are All Right\" and \"In Treatment\" in a performance that beautifully conveys both Jane's emotional vulnerability and her strength of character) takes a job as a governess at a home called Thornfield. She is warmly welcomed by the housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax (Dame Judi Dench) and her charge, a little French girl, but it is some time before she meets her new employer, Mr. Rochester (Michael Fassbender, in a less broody, more desperately unhappy performance). When she first sees him, she is walking in the woods and his horse rears up and throws him. She must help him to the house and they walk slowly, him leaning on her heavily. The emotional upheaval and unexpected intimacy of this encounter are followed by mysterious disturbances in the house, by an anguished longing, an almost unimaginable romantic ecstasy, and then by betrayal, loss, a new start, unexpected independence, and then acknowledgment of a connection too strong to resist.\n\nAnd it is that relationship, all smolder and repressed passion, that answers the question. The Eyre\/Rochester romance has inspired happy sighs for 160 years and in these days, when so little is repressed that no one makes time for smolder, it still delivers.\n\nDirector Cary Fukunaga (\"Sin Nombre\") wisely used natural light and no make-up to give this version a rough, natural, intimate feel. Jane's hair is a smooth loop over each ear with an intricate knot in the back, showing capability and determination. And perhaps some imagination as well. The way that the setting and events seem to embody the emotion the main characters cannot express, which is what makes an internally narrated story so compellingly cinematic.\n\nParents should know that this film includes child abuse and a sad death of a child, disturbing and scary incidents including a fire, and a nude picture.\n\nFamily discussion: Why wasn't Jane afraid of Mr. Rochester? How were they alike? How does the setting help tell the story?\n\nIf you like this, try: the book by Charlotte Bronte and the other movie versions of this story, especially the 1943 version with Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine and the 1996 version with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, and try the book or movie \"The Wide Sargasso Sea,\" the same story told from the point of view of the woman in the attic"}
{"text":"What Lies Beyond?\n\nPros:Thought-provoking acting and script, with capable direction Cons:The afterlife itself really isn't different from other accounts The Bottom Line: Does anyone really have a guarantee of eternal life?\n\nWhat happens when we die? Nobody knows for sure. Hereafter, though, takes a look at three people who sense a connection with the Great Beyond.\n\nMatt Damon stars as George Lonegan, a San Farncisco warehouse worker who once made a living helping people connect with the dead. In spite of pleas from his businessman brother, Billy (Jay Mohr), George refuses to return to work for which George appears to have a gift. He wants to focus on living.\n\nMeanwhile, two people a continent away have problems putting their death experiences behind them. French television journalist Marie Lelay (Cecile de France) nearly drowns while on holiday in Asia. She takes a leave of absence from her book to write a political book, but finds she's writing more about her incident than politics. In London, twins Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) are separated by death when Jason is accidentally killed running an errand for his substance-dependent mother. With her problems and without Jason to help him cover her, Marcus is placed in foster care. He misbehaves and seeks out help contacting Jason. When George has bad fortune with his job and a relationship, he heads to London, where he meets Marie and Marcus at a book fair.\n\nEven though his resume is connected primarily with westerns and police thrillers, director Clint Eastwood should also be remembered for thoughtful films such as Hereafter. Hereafter looks at the possibility of life after death without being religious or preachy. His film states that people will know some things to be true without proof, or the ability to present proof. George, Marie, and Marcus have have different death encounters that change them. Each wants to get back to a life that is normal. Eastwood has the benefit of a literate, thought-provoking script from Peter Morgan, whose screenwriting credits include The Queen and Frost\/Nixon. Eastwood and Morgan's depiction of the afterlife isn't different from other interpretations, but they create a compelling mix of sorrow and wonder with their main characters as they deal with their feelings.\n\nDamon gives a quietly effective performance as George, who feels the calls from the afterlife, but wishing he could make those calls go away. People don't understand how his touch with people affects him. He finds solace in the works of Dickens because the words allow him to live, albeit vicariously. I also like de France and the McLarens as people coming to grips with their experiences. Mohr is good as a brother who tries to compel George to make his ability a business again. The voice reading Dickens is Derek Jacobi, who makes a cameo appearance doing the same at the book fair.\n\nNobody in modern history has died, then told us what awaits on the other side. Many believe another life awaits after our earthly stay, while others contend this existence is all we get for eternity. Hereafter acknowledges both sides, and realizes each person sees the debate uniquely. Even George, Marie, and Marcus come to their beliefs in different ways. They have been touched by those from another realm, and it is a touch that will always stay with them."}

{"text":"Summary:Have you ever wanted to relive your childhood and do things differently? Guy Maddin casts B-movie icon Ann Savage as his domineering mother in attempt to answer that question in My Winnipeg My Winnipeg is Maddin's most personal film and a truly unique cinematic experience, winning the best Canadian film at the Toronto International Film Festival and the opening night selection of the Berlin Film Festival's Forum. (IFC Films)\u2026ExpandWhat is \"My Winnipeg\"? Sure, it's easy to dismiss it as an experimental film, but that's like blacklisting it to a future in some storage bin in a modern art museum, which would be a shame. The film claims to be a documentary about Guy Maddin's hometown, Winnipeg, MB. The footage shows what appears to be reenactments of Maddin's childhood, scenes from his family and a speckled history of the town. From the beginning it's obvious that this 'reality' is pure imagination, a fantasy concocted by Maddin, but for what purpose? Why is he trying to escape reality and his hometown that he loves so dearly? The best way to understand is to watch it, accept it as truth like Maddin has, and experience the world as it becomes a much more magical place.\u2026Expand\n\nIt's watchable and amusing, but incomplete as a work of art. Maddin's voice-over narrative has some witty quips but deflates rather than fueling the romantic\/mythic\/dreamlike emotional energy he's trying for. The best sequence in the film is a silent recreation of a seance in the Legislature; only for these few minutes is the film allowed to speak for itself and achieve some real emotional impact. For such a visual director, he repeatedly violates the \"show me, don't tell me\" rule, so that the visuals and narrative don't add to each other but just run side by side, and that loosely. Also surprisingly, there are too few visual ideas in the film; Maddin keeps showing us the same image over and over long after the point has been made. There's some brilliant editing, but the style of the film is monotonous; intensity comes in random fits and starts, but never achieves any momentum or arc. Narratively, there's no insight what makes Winnipeg tick or why its city council makes the famously bad decisions it does, nor why Winnipegers allow those decisions to happen and nurse the feelings of betrayal that they do. Maddin's ironic detachment functions more as a self-protective mask than as an opportunity for critical reappraisal of the sentiments he's expressions. Overall, the whole thing comes across as fairly masturbatory (metaphorically speaking, although there is some fairly cliched stuff about sexual repression in here); one is tempted to think the director isn't interested in anyone's emotions but his own, and is not much in touch with those. There is a lot of potential in this film (it might have worked brilliantly as an all-silent film) but it's an unfinished and art-schoolish, not the work of a mature artist.\u2026Expand"}

{"text":"\"A Day in The Country\" is a unfinished film by French grand-master Jean Renoir which now can only be appreciated as a vague short film.\n\nIt is filmed ever so beautifully and it carries a sense of nostalgia and earthy passion in the viewer that creates a wonderful experience. The only problem is it being unfinished. it does not flow seamlessly as a short film and is not as effective in its plot development or at genuinely touching its viewer like I know it has the potential to do at feature length.\n\nThe story is a passionate one with themes of nostalgia and longing for a different kind of life to lost love and regrets. The final sequence which is\u2026\n\nJean Renoir's A Day in the Country, compiled and edited from footage of a movie Renoir never quite completed, is a surprisingly powerful, moving short that tells a bittersweet love story that is brief but beautiful. Only forty minutes long, this is a film you don't want to miss. Delightful.\n\nPerhaps the greatest unfinished film of all time, Jean Renoir's Partie de Campagne follows the Dufour family who are spending a day in the country. Unbeknownst to Monsieur Dufour, while he's fishing with his daughter's fiancee, his daughter and wife are spending their time with two strange men. Beautifully shot, even in its unfinished state Renoir's symbolic day in the country is one of cinema's most powerful statements on the impermanence of human nature.\n\nShort film which established a tone of nostalgia and whimsicalness that made me want to go out into the country and roll around in the grass for a few hours. But plot wise this is weak, and I call bullshit on the \"love story\" here, which is basically romanticised rape - the film is pretty deplorable for that. Can't see this film being great even if it was finished, but it's technically accomplished and has a certain poetry to some of the sequences of images, but again characters and plot that, while it's unfair to say so considering the state of the film, are too underdeveloped."}

{"text":"TV\n\nTV review: 'Parade's End'\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch stars as a very, very British guy in Parade's End.\n\nThe Details\n\nParade's End\n\nFebruary 26-28, 9 p.m., HBO\n\nThe HBO\/BBC miniseries Parade's End, based on Ford Madox Ford's acclaimed 1920s quartet of novels, is very British indeed. Partly that means it's full of dry, biting wit, but partly that means its main character is so upstanding and repressed that he's a bit of a drag to spend five hours with. Rising star Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock) stars as stuffy, uptight bureaucrat Christopher Tietjens, who comes from an aristocratic family and is clinging to old traditions as Great Britain heads into World War I.\n\nCumberbatch is a model of stiff-upper-lipness as Christopher, but it's Rebecca Hall as his flighty socialite wife Sylvia who really steals the show. Sylvia spends the entire series attempting to make Christopher miserable, via her liaisons with other men and her exploitation of his sense of duty, especially as she keeps him from the true love of his life, young suffragette Valentine Wannop (Adelaide Clemens). Hall's vibrant performance, with her spirited delivery of Sylvia's acid-tongued barbs, is consistently entertaining, but Christopher's endless propriety gets a little tedious.\n\nWith four novels to adapt, writer Tom Stoppard and director Susanna White have a lot of material to cover, and the series' pacing is choppy and uneven throughout; sometimes it seems as if scenes have been omitted as the narrative jumps ahead in time or from one place to another. Christopher and Sylvia's sparring gets tiresome as it goes around in circles, and White isn't particularly effective at depicting the horrors of combat once Christopher goes off to war. Parts of Parade's End work as top-notch period drama, but the parts that don't work ultimately drag the whole series down"}

{"text":"Every time that guy opens his mouth, He reduces the sum of human knowledge.\n\nSaturday, September 11, 2010\n\nAppreciation: Diary of a Country Priest\n\nI've just come off a two-hour (almost) engagement with Robert Bresson's Diary of a Country Priest. I'd read the book a few years ago but I'm not sure I ever heard of the movie until I ran into it in someone's appreciation of Bresson. I'd say it is well worth the effort; it's interestingly shot, with a craftsmanlike use of voice-over (the :Diary\"). He's made great use of his non-color color, washing out all the blacks and whites into a kind of spooky pallet of grey. There's enough gloom here to remind you of Bergman, although you'd have to say that Bresson and Bergman are each gloomy in their own way.\n\nIt's a coming of age movie: young priest on his first assignment, and probably the best thing to say about it is that there is not a whiff of Bing Crosby or Barry Fitzgerald. It's an earnest and carefully-observed effort to understand loneliness and spiritual challenge, in the company of a physical body that harbors a will of its own. It's respectful and compassionate and devoid of cheap tricks, but I'm not persuaded that Claude Laydu had the chops for part that requires so much face time with the camera.\n\nI suspect the problem starts with the book itself: George Bernaonos' original is at least as bleak as the movie without the consolation of those breathtaking grey skies. As such, it is a truthful picture of the difficulties and disappointments in the believer's life: a chastening reminder of how hard it is to do any good at all. An additional difficulty is that for a book\/movie about a priesthood, there is a strangely limited take on the job of comforting the afflicted. Laydu has essentially one \"client;\" she lost a son and is inconsolable. But she is a countess with plenty of means for consolation apart from this poor unseasoned youth. Flip side: for a community that seems so poor, there are scarcely any poor people. What, exactly, does the priest do all day?\n\nYet it still commands respect, perhaps not so much for what it does, but for what it refuses to do--rhe number of occasions on which the director refuses to allow either his character or his audience any manufactured consolation. Maybe you could run it as a training film for the Peace Corps, especially if you want to make sure you drive away all the waverers before the cost the sponsors a lot of money.\n\nPerhaps you could pair it with another I ran across a few months ago--I gather this too is a movie though I have only read the novel. I'm thinking of Upamanyu Chatterjee's English, August, another coming-of-age story about a young man cast adrift with a mandate to do good in a millieu he doesn't really understand. Unlike Bernanos' priest, Chatterjee's young man spends most of his time smoking dope and masturbating. I understand it was a huge hit among young urbans in India."}

They complain \"nothing happens.\" They've been trained by movies that tell them where to look and what to feel, in stories that have a beginning, a middle and an end. Lost in Translation offers an experience in the exercise of empathy.\"\n\nBob Harris (Murray) is a Hollywood actor past his prime, who despite his fame and success feels existentially empty. He goes to Tokyo to play in a commercial for the Suntory whiskey brand. Plagued by insomnia, he meets Charlotte (Johansson), the young and bored wife of a fashion photographer (Ribisi). On the outskirts of the movie is Kelly (Faris), a movie star who is promoting her newest flick.\n\nWith too much time on their hands and no idea what to do in Japan, Bob and Charlotte drift together and become emotionally close.\n\nBilingual Bonus: Amusing scenes in which Bob and Charlotte interact with the locals are even funnier if you understand Japanese.\n\nNot to mention the direction given to Bob.\n\nThe Director:(in Japanese, to his interpreter) The translation is very important, okay? The translation.\n\nInterpreter:(in Japanese) Yes, of course. I understand.\n\nThe Director:(In Japanese, to Bob) Mr. Bob. You are sitting quietly in your study. And then there is a bottle of Suntory whisky on top of the table. You understand, right?

As if you are Bogie in Casablanca, saying, \"Here's looking at you, kid,\"\u2014Suntory time!\n\nThe Interpreter:(In English, to Bob) He wants you to turn, look into camera, okay?\n\nCelebrity Paradox: Actually a weird subversion. While channel-surfing, Bob chances upon a Saturday Night Live re-run that features a younger Bill Murray, but it is implied that In-Universe it is a movie or TV show featuring Bob Harris, not Murray.\n\nDefictionalization: Suntory started using the Catch Phrase from the fictional Suntory ads in actual Suntory ads run in the United States (which also led Suntory to attempt an expansion of their distribution in America).\n\nPretty much any time Charlotte is alone in her room. The girl does not seem to like pants.\n\nFish out of Water: Both Bob and Charlotte are completely unfamiliar with Japanese culture, and find life in Tokyo endlessly baffling.\n\nForeign Queasine: Bob and Charlotte go to a shabu-shabu restaurant and later mention that it was a terrible experience (although discussion of the lunch is an allusion to the awkward social situation around it).\n\nJapanese Language: Plenty of it, obviously, none of it subtitled. Unless the audience understands Japanese, they are as clueless as the characters about what the locals try to tell them, which fits with both the title and the theme of the film.\n\nKaraoke Box: Bob and Charlotte go to one with their Japanese friends after a party.\n\nLife of the Party: Subverted. As Roger Ebert puts it in his review of the film: \"Bob Harris, who could be funny, who could be the life of the party, who could do impressions in the karaoke bar and play games with the director of the TV commercial, but doesn't\u2014because being funny is what he does for a living, and right now he is too tired and sad to do it for free.\"\n\nReality Has No Subtitles: It's heavy handed in this, but it works for the movie's story. When two Americans are stuck in Japan for different reasons, and can't speak the native language, they start to feel very isolated, especially in a culture so foreign to the West. Having characters speak in Japanese without offering any subtitles emphasizes the isolation both of them feel, and how alien it could be in that world without anyone around to communicate with.\n\nSomeone used audio enhancement to find out what Bill Murray actually said, and posted it on Youtube. But this is a case of Completely Missing the Point, as the audience wasn't supposed to know what Bob said to Charlotte, so Coppola didn't write any dialogue for that moment and instead just told Murray to ad-lib something so they could get the shot of Bob whispering to Charlotte.\n\nReportedly, someone on a cruise ship asked Murray what he said. As Murray started to reply, the ship's horn happened to blow, so he immediately went with it, acting like he was revealing the secret while no one could hear him.\n\nAlso, who is the actor Bob was talking about to the waiter, the actor whom has been married a couple of times and whom Bob doesn't care is gay or not?\n\nShout Out: Kelly is in Japan on a promotional tour for a movie that is called Midnight Velocity, sounds like The Matrix, and even stars Keanu Reeves.\n\nThe opening shot is a more fanservice-y recreation of one in In the Mood for Love. The dinner scene at the Shabu-shabu restaurant is also a reference to the same movie."}

{"text":"For those of you who are John Grisham fans and wondering if the movie is anything remotely like his 1996 best-selling legal literary thriller, it's not. The civil case before the court is no longer about jury tampering and the big bad tobacco company. Now it's about jury tampering and a firearms company that is sued by the widow of a man who was gunned down in his office. Veteran actors Hoffman and Hackman are collaborating for the first time on screen after some 40 years of friendship. Plot: When a family man is murdered by an angry employee on a rampage, the widow hires Wendall Rohr (Hoffman), known for his wit and being an advocate against gun violence. The other side hires an infamous jury consultant, Rankin Fitch (Hackman), to assist their attorney representing the gun manufacturer. What both of them discover in their \"discovery\" is a plot to manipulate the jury by someone on the inside. With millions of dollars at stake, the two sides use various means to try and secure the votes of the jury to win a case that will set precedence for gun cases.\n\nGood: Director Gary Fleder (''Don't Say a Word'', \"Kiss the Girls\"), has taken this Grisham tale and loaded it with lots of action, intense moments of physical danger and bold dialogue like ''We love fat women, people!'' (It's a line used by Hackman when he instructs his troop of snoops, blackmailers and operatives who work for him.) This is a world of secretly shot footage of potential jurors, vindictive and manipulative actions against the twelve jurors and an involving side plot with a juror (Cusack and his mysterious girlfriend, Weisz). The two scheme to sell the jury to the highest bidder which creates the danger and greed that propels the plot. In the end, there's an unexpected twist that involves their past, where true intentions are brought to light and redeem their behavior. Hackman is perfect as the clich\u00e9 of amoral ruthlessness, coolly directing his team like a symphony. Hoffman plays the old-fashioned, above-board \"good guy\" who is confident and honest but still has a few tricks up his sleeve. I enjoyed the dynamic storyline, but it seemed too bizarre to be true and too horrifying if any of it is true. I think the OJ trial created skepticism about our legal system and juries being bought or bribed. This story doesn't exactly help that line of thinking. In fact, it left me wondering and sort of hesitant about any future jury duty I have to pull.\n\nBad: Although the action is interesting and the acting entertaining, there are a couple of things that bother me about this movie. When you have a story about a jury and the director casts a group of actors like Nora Dunn, Luis Guzman, Orlando Jones and Jennifer Beals, I think it's safe to expect some strong performances from the talented bunch. Instead, either the editor left the best parts on the cutting room floor or there were no best parts to be cut. Jeremy Piven plays an idealistic jury consultant who fast-talks his way onto Rohr's team, then does little besides gape skeptically at the counsel's unorthodox tactics. My biggest gripe is that the story uses the movie as a political soapbox against gun manufacturers and does it in such an obvious, over-the-top and politically correct way, that it should be embarrassing to everyone involved. Hackman's character represents the ruthless, evil, \"no feelings\" law, that stomps all over the common man for the sake of the powerful and mighty gun manufacturer and smacks of evil. Hoffman is portrayed as the human \"with a heart\" against guns, sent to represent and protect the poor widow and her son against the evil gun manufacturers. By film's end, he's practically made into a hero \u2013 but for what and why? The story acts as if some triumphant victory was established because a gun manufacturer was found guilty of a shooting spree it didn't commit. Never-mind the fact that the murders were committed by an emotionally and mentally disturbed employee who came into the office with premeditation to vent his anger at his former co-workers. Does Hollywood truly believe its own hype? What's worse, does it think we do?\n\nBottom Line: I despise the political message in this film and the way they went about showing it. To blame the sin and horrible act that one man commits (against several innocent people) on a gun manufacturer just because it was their gun that he used is ridiculous. If we take away accountability for our actions in society and to each other, then we have nothing of real value left."}

{"text":"Upon first reading about The Ledge, it felt like one of those classic Sundance Film Festival movies that could breakout and be a hit. It has a well-known cast, an experienced writer\/director and a story that's easily digestible. The story is about how and why a man on the ledge of a building is ready to kill himself, the cast includes Charlie Hunnam, Liv Tyler, Patrick Wilson and Terrence Howard and the writer\/director is Matthew Chapman, who wrote Runaway Jury, Color of Night and Consenting Adults.\n\nAnd while The Ledge is filled with interesting characters, solid performances and even some smart, thought-provoking dialogue, the story itself wanders around like leaf in the wind, at times totally unaware of the driving force of the movie: the Ledge of the title. Read more after the jump.\n\nHunnam, best known for roles on Sons of Anarchy and Undeclared, plays Gavin, a hotel manager who befriends his next door neighbors Joe and Shauna, a religious couple played by Wilson (Watchmen) and Tyler (Armageddon). But before all that, Gavin is just a mysterious guy with a suicidal ultimatum. Stand on this ledge until noon and then jump off. If you don't, someone else is going to die. A police officer (Howard) is there to hear the whole story and he's not having a good day either.\n\nWhat then follows is an extremely long flashback attempting to explain how Gavin got on that ledge. It begins with his attraction towards Shauna as well as the riff Joe's extreme religious beliefs have on both his wife and neighbor. All types of religious issues are debated at length and, add that to the budding romance, it's easy to forget the mystery of the film's opening. Once we finally get back to the ledge, though, it's an after-thought. Thanks to the character development, we're so invested in the flashback that the ledge itself isn't as exciting or mysterious as it was. It's just an illogical conclusion to a slew of other ideas. A post script to a whole other movie.\n\nOne gets the sense that Chapman is a much better writer than director and while he gets his actors to give very believable performances (Tyler and Wilson, in particular, shine) the direction feels somewhat flat and without urgency. The Ledge is a love story and a think piece. But what got the audience into the seats was the mystery of why Gavin is thinking of killing himself and it never feels like the movie cares about that."}

{"text":"Push Review: Dakota Fanning Makes You Laugh\n\nBased from the comic of the same name, Push tackles a new take on a band of people with special powers that combine their efforts to overcome the victimization of humanity. Director Paul McGuigan takes the helm on this adaptation and injects it with a thriller-esque quality that typically isn't seen in movies of this genre.\n\nPush focuses on Nick Gant (Chris Evans) who is developing the ability to move objects with his mind whilst tracked by a shady US government organization known as the Division, This organization genetically, or rather, psychically engineer people to have mental abilities that allow them to be telekinetic, clairvoyant, psychic, etc so that they can use them as weapons. Nick knows this and thus lives in Hong Kong, trying to stay out of the reach of this organization and consequently, others with unique abilities such as Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning) and Kira Hudson (Camille Belle) who are similarly exploited by the Division end up in Hong Kong as well to assist Nick.\n\nVisually Push is stunning, bolstered by unique urban locations chaos; so much so that some audiences may be distracted by it. However, the hustle and bustle of it all plays well into the danger posed by the cast's surroundings and gives the bad guys an edge since you never where they're going to pop up which subsequently makes for some very intense action-oriented sequences. The downside to the locations is the movie's bulk is shot in one central spot. Fortunately since this location is so diverse, it rarely looks uninteresting.\n\nThe other visually compelling achievement is the effectiveness and cutting edge use of the abilities. They are evoked in a believably subtle manner at times and aren't garishly oversaturated like in some super hero movies.\n\nEvans and Belle fill fairly typical character roles that fail to differentiate themselves from similar films. However, the way Evan's character pulls the wool over the eyes is brilliant, especially when the protagonists collaborate their efforts.\n\nThe show stealer without a doubt is Dakota Fanning. Her quirky and charming demeanor supplies the most amusing scenes and even in her most envelope-pushing scene she is hilarious. On the antagonists' side, Djimon Hounsou is a convincing bad guy and his ability makes him exceedingly frightening. The Chinese faction of villains, though not as frightful as Hounsou's character, utilize their powers in an amusingly demonic way and no doubt will the anime fanboys love the villainess of the group.\n\nWith the comic industry making such an impression on Hollywood and with so many of them being about a team of individuals with unique abilities, Push will more than likely muster a cult following in the shadows of juggernauts like Heroes and X-Men.

He's such a joy to watch, the critical part of the brain shuts down. Eventually, as the film nears the conclusion, Sanders looses his control, letting judgments percolate to the surface. This condition isn't particularly rare, but what makes Double Trouble is the repeating effect. Even after it's clear the film's charm is pulling the wool over the viewer's eyes, it goes ahead and charms him or her again, setting up another realization a few minutes further into the running time. It keeps it up until the final shot, which plays on the surface like it should get a pass\u2026 but it's really quite hollow.\n\nThere's a distressing lack of content to The Saint's Double Trouble. It opens rather grandiosely\u2013or, with grandiose promise\u2013in Cairo. Bela Lugosi shows up, mailing a coffin back to the States (there's no reference to Dracula, which is kind of unfortunate, because it's got to be what the viewer's thinking). Lugosi's actually quite good in Double Trouble\u2013it might be his best performance (or the best performance I've seen from him). But then the film skips to Philadelphia and in The Saint's Double Trouble, Philadelphia only has one exterior street corner. There's a depressing lack of scale, with the script, budget and direction failing each other. Hively doesn't do anything to make the film feel like it's taking place anywhere other than a backlot. He's a decent director, even if he likes cheap shots occasionally\u2013and he can't direct a suspenseful scene\u2013but he's generally fine.\n\nThe script's a different story. It's got some good one-liners and some fine conversations, but the film's plot is so addlebrained, the incredibly complex series of double crosses\u2013occurring off-screen\u2013is never unraveled. It's not as important as the film's hook, George Sanders playing both the Saint and the villain. These two characters apparently know each other\u2013it's implied, at least\u2013but there's never anything more about it. I'm all for letting the viewer figure things out for him or herself, but The Saint's Double Trouble asks the viewer to ignore critical reasoning and it goes down like castor oil.\n\nThe film's abbreviated running time\u2013sixty-six minutes soaking wet\u2013means not only does Lugosi get short-changed (he's even funny at one point), but so does second-billed Helene Whitney. She has a bunch of history with Sanders\u2013thank you expository dialogue\u2013but it doesn't go anywhere. Their scenes together are wasted, accelerating the plot. Sanders is great in the scenes, but the film doesn't have a single payoff. It keeps deferring the payoff\u2013it really does seem like it'll come at the end\u2013but no. The film pulls it away again\u2026 and the end is so cheaply done, it makes The Saint's Double Trouble seem like a low budget impression, filmed in someone's backyard. Hively's not entirely at fault\u2013RKO controlled the budget\u2013but he doesn't do anything creative.\n\nDirected by Jack Hively; screenplay by Ben Holmes, based on the novel by Leslie Charteris; director of photography, J. Roy Hunt; edited by Theron Warth and Desmond Marquette; music by Roy Webb; produced by Cliff Reid; released by RKO Radio Pictures."}

{"text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUser Reviews\n\nThis is an immigrant movie about three ladies, one from Hong Kong, one from mainland China and one from Taiwan, who all settle in New York. Stchingawa marries a Chinese man, but misses home. Sylvia Chang (Taiwan) goes through relationships that are not very fulfilling and Maggie Cheung plays a successful businesswoman. Its basically a story of immigrant life in the big city, always fertile ground for a film. However, the characters, to me, seem underwritten. Maybe that the film was lensed a while ago and I'm seeing it now is the reason, but it just didn't ring true. I like thyat the three ladies became friends, but feel more should have been explored on that. Their individual lives are not as interesting. I cant fault the acting, especially with the always flawless Maggie Cheung in her role, but I felt the film had potential it never realized. It should be remade now, with the same people, and it would probably make a more interesting film. So, better than okay on the strength of the performances, but not as good as it could have been.\n\n0 of 0 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?"}

Henry Barthes (AdrienBrody) is a stone-faced loner who happens to be the best public school substitute teacher around, an honor he admits is dubious. In between visits to an ineptly run nursing home where his senile grandfather resides, Barthes takes a month-long gig at an embattled public high school, where he strikes up a tentative relationship with fellow teacher Ms. Madison (ChristinaHendricks) and serves as reluctant mentor to Meredith (the director's daughter, BettyKaye), an artsy outcast. A brooding cynic, Barthes is still a bleeding heart whose icy disdain for self-destruction is further evidenced by the asylum he offers to baby-faced Erica (SamiGayle), a teenaged prostitute that he takes into his home. The film makes high school life seem like guerrilla warfare, the hallways like the Vietnam jungle, with the ApocalypseNow parallels furthered by interspersed narration from an emotionally battered Barthes. Brody, who is phenomenal, is supported by an ensemble that boats strong performances all around, especially Gayle and JamesCaan as a pill-popping instructor. The editing can be distracting at times, and the film is generally well-written, even in its relative predictability.

{"text":"HOFF 2011: Norwegian Ninja\n\nHere is what is true about Norwegian Ninja. In 1984 Norwegian diplomat Arne Treholt was convicted of high treason and selling state secrets. He was convicted to a twenty year prison term and served eight of them before being pardoned in 1992. Treholt has been living in exile on the island of Cyprus ever since. He has always maintained his innocence regarding the charges he faced.\n\nWhat is also true is that around that time during the Cold War\nperiod NATO and the CIA secretly operated what are known as Stay-Behind\nForces throughout Europe. The intention for these groups were that they\nwere to be a built-in resistance should the Russians invade. What\nhappened was either there was an itch that needed to be scratched or\nthey were following orders but some of these groups carried out\nterrorist attacks on friendly soil. The purpose was to stoke fear of\nSoviet invasion and allow the military and secret services influence\nacross the region. So, in 1978 Norwegian police discovered a large cache\nof weapons on the property of Hans Otto Meyer. Meyer was a Norwegian\nIntelligence Service officer and believed to be the head of the\nNorwegian Stay Behind Force.\n\nSo Thomas Malling\ntakes these two documented accounts and molds them into one story. Then\nhe finds a fair share of archival footage which shows how real those\ncircumstances were and how real the fear was. Then he creates a story\nabout a commune of Ninjas, who live on an island protected by Feng Shui,\nwho were sanctioned by the King to protect Norway and her interests.\nMalling pits Treholt and Meyer against each other, making their stories\none. One wants the Ninjas disbanded, the other wants to expose the\nother's corruption.\n\nTake the real life\naccounts of a Norwegian diplomat using archival footage and ask a simple\nquestion, 'What if Treholt was a Ninja and these events were all part\nof a greater scheme and plan?' Suddenly the true life accounts take on\nthese fantastical elements, like discovering that if you stand on the\nseat of a playground swing your life changes. Yeah, the story is the\nsame; it just became much more awesome though. I mean, NINJAS! Norwegian\nNinja walks the fine line between fiction and fantasy. So well, and so\nconvincing is the director's vision, that you could almost believe it to\nbe true. If it weren't for such things as the miniature practical\neffects, which pay homage to the most popular Norwegian film of all\ntime, the stop animated film Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix, you might just do so.\n\nThough\nthe film feels a touch clunky at times and flow of the narrative\nsuffers a slight bit as a result Norwegian Ninja still delivers plenty\nlaughs and excitement.

But it's also charming, hilarious, heartbreaking, wonderful, and heartwarming all at the same time.\n\nThe first segment of the movie is a short flashback which covers a lot of time: the majority of Carl's life up until the events of the movie, specifically his relationship with Ellie, his late wife. The first portion of the flashback covers the time when they first met when they were very young; they both shared an enthusiasm for adventure. The second portion is an accelerated depiction of their courtship and married life, which is presented without dialogue. At the end of this segment, I was weeping. The movie had barely even started! I was in tears again by the end. In between, I had laughed a lot, smiled a lot, gasped a lot, among many other things.\n\nWe love to feel emotion! That is what makes Up (and most other Pixar films [not Cars]) so good. They evoke so many different emotions in us all because of their ability to relate the most outlandish characters to anyone.

{"text":"Sam Strange Remembers: FROM PARIS WITH LOVE\n\nThe Hollywood legend recalls when he made one of the great movies of all time.\n\nEven when you've been around as long as I have, movie making isn't an exact science. A great deal of it relies on dumb luck and coincidence. The line between a masterpiece and an utter failure is thinner than many realize.\n\nBut that doesn't alleviate the raw misery that slams down when you're forced to confront the fact that your movie is a complete piece of shit. I've seen it happen a hundred times. The very best of us have faced that horror and never come back intact.\n\nIt's like when I made From Paris with Love. All throughout filming I had this sneaking suspicion that something wasn't right, and even with all my time-honed instinct and craftsmanship, I couldn't do anything as a director to guide my ship back to calmer, more familiar waters. And then when I finally saw the picture, it all came crashing down. I had made one of the greatest movies of all time. It only felt like a disaster making it because the two extremes are so similar.\n\nFrom Paris with Love is pure cinema. It is everything I've ever learned about what people want to see on film, all collected and spread onto the screen like a peanut butter made out of mulched testicles. Real men love it. In fact, real men are the only people who can even watch it.\n\nMore than anything, From Paris in Love is about how big its own penis is, but if you need a plot, it has one of those too. We're introduced to our main character, played by a lithe, Adonis-like Jonathan Rhys Davies, as he's playing chess with an aged American diplomat he works for. Despite looking so, so, beautiful (I mean, he looks like he's already been fucked cross-eyed before you've even touched him), he's actually quite good at chess. As the old man notes, he's using Bobby Fischer's moves. All people who are really good at chess know who Bobby Fischer is because everyone at home knows who Bobby Fischer is because there was that movie with his name in the title (I forgot what it was called, but it had Joe Magneto in it).\n\nWhile busy performing all the duties male secretaries tend to perform upon old white politicians, Jonathan Cameron Mitchell also works as a Jr. Secret Agent for some unknown secret agency. They call him at inopportune times and ask him to do stupid shit like switch random license plates or plant bugs in meeting rooms. He wants to move up to the really dangerous stuff, but they won't let him because boys so beautiful simply don't look like they can handle it (this film takes a long, hard look at the Twink glass ceiling and doesn't like what it sees).\n\nMeanwhile at home, Jonathan Richmond Virginia has a really hot lady that he thinks he might marry because her interest in sex is very casual, and she's far more into staying up late eating snacks and watching bad TV shows. Because he's so young, he does not yet realize that all men are at war with all women and there's no such thing as a penile deficient friend.\n\nBut none of this shit matters because you are not supposed to care about Johnny Cash Nickels. He's only the star of this film because young hot studs have to be the focal point in movies where young hot studs learn to be old hot ironsides.\n\nSo, let's talk Travolta because he basically IS this film and he's worth several paragraphs of sorting out.\n\nWhen I started getting ready for From Paris with Love, they told me it was impossible to do Blackface in 2010. Maybe they would have been right if I didn't have John Travolta on my side.\n\n(Why I needed him to do Blackface is a long story. The movie was supposed to star Vin Diesel, but he dropped out. So Travolta is basically pretending to be Vin Diesel. But our society is so racist that when you paint a white guy dark to look like a mostly-white black guy, everyone calls it Blackface, when I can tell you for a fact that Travolta was way more Muslimface than Blackface as far as our make-up department spray paint canisters were concerned.)\n\nSee, Travolta used to be the fucking coolest guy on the planet. Then his inability to edit himself got in the way. Then his inability to edit himself made him a star again, and our inability to edit what we're entertained by allowed him to remain a star indefinitely.\n\nTravolta represents the Baby Boomer Generation's horrid penchant for taking a promising start and mistaking it for a lifetime pass into coolville. As a result, they do stupid shit all the time, but never know it because self-editing is too much like Vietnam. Therefore, Travolta will do blackface without batting an eye because in his mind, we're all black. I mean, he literally made a movie in the 90s where all white people were black people.\n\nWhen we first meet Travolta in this film it's a bit of a shock. Not only is he in Blackface, but he's also in Blackvoice and looks more like the human personification of a penis than anyone has ever attempted before. We wanted him to look uncircumcised, so he's always wearing this silk scarf that conceals the fact that he has a neck.\n\nJonathan Taylor Thomas has been assigned with babysitting Travolta, and the first thing he has to do is save him from customs agents who refuse to let Travolta enter Paris with an energy drink called \"Rooster Cum\". He could probably get through with the stuff, but he seems dead-set on being belligerent to French people because he's racist against French people.\n\nEventually, Jonathan Rhythm Nation smoothes things over and Travolta can enter Paris WITH his Rooster Cum drink, which turns out to be a handgun smuggling canister, even though he's an agent and can carry as many guns as he wants to shoot as many people as he wants. BUT WHAT'S THE FUN IN THAT!?\n\nSo the first thing Travolta wants to do is go kill Chinamen. Jonathan Rhys Brandis calls his superior to complain about Travolta's highly unconventional tactics, but they tell him he's the best and he needs to do everything the guys says, no matter how strange. So they go kill Chinamen.\n\nWhile killing Chinamen, Travolta gets a lead on where more Chinamen might be. And these Chinamen have coke! So they go kill those Chinamen and fill a big vase with coke that's just raining from the ceiling.\n\nThen they go on a gondola ride. It's pretty boring, so they do a bunch of coke and talk about how women think their tits are awesome, but when you get right down to it, they just don't know how to handle a wiener like another dude does. Travolta happens to be getting an HJ from a Frenchlady while having this conversation. She looks a lot like Keith Richards.\n\nAfter that, they go to kill more Chinamen. But now the Chinamen are some kind of Muslimmen, except for Jonathan Rhys Ifans' girlfriend who is a Muslimwoman. After killing a lot of Muslimmen, Travolta and Jonathan Rhys Wise go home where his girlfriend (and a friend of hers that no one has ever met before) is waiting to feed them food.\n\nOver the course of dinner everyone has a good time. Travolta makes a really funny joke where it looks like he's getting an erection but then reveals it was just a butter knife and that he doesn't get erections down there because his penis is his face.\n\nAt some point, the mysterious friend gets a phone call which promps her to say the secret badguy code word: \"Hello?\" Immediately, Travolta acts: \"That's the call we've been waiting for,\" and shoots her in the head. At this point, the other girlfriend reveals that she's been a Muslimwoman all along, and her only mission in life is to blow up American politicians traveling to France. She gets away by running.\n\nSo now both boys have to stop this girl from blowing people up with her body. This is hard work for Travolta because instead of killing everyone he has to try and kill only one person. Ultimately, he doesn't need to. Jonathan Stephanie Meyers shoots her in the face before she can blow anything up. The world sees this on youtube and rallies to rid women from the planet completely. Unsurprisingly, the movement's biggest supporters are all women from the south.\n\nWith no girlfriend holding him back, Jonathan Rhys Frakes can finally be the super agent the world needs him to be. The film ends with him and Travolta playing chess together. The beginning of a long wonderful father\/son relationship that will go on to survive two world wars and five miscarriages"}
{"text":"'Looper' is great sci-fi\n\nCampus Correspondent\n\nPublished: Monday, October 1, 2012\n\nUpdated: Monday, October 1, 2012 22:10\n\n\"Looper\" is one of those movies that is constantly unraveling itself. Just when you think it's going in one direction, it turns onto a different road. It makes you think you've been told everything, only to reveal more secrets. It surprises and amazes you at the same time.\n\n\"Looper\" takes place in the year 2042, where Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) plays an assassin hired by the future mob. They send their enemies back in time to be killed and get away with murder. Eventually, every one of these assassins, known as Loopers, have to kill their future selves as part of a contractual obligation. Joe soon encounters his older self, portrayed by Bruce Willis, in a role that only he could play, and faces difficulties in hunting him down. That isn't even half of the entire story, but if that sounds interesting on its own, trust me when I say it gets ten times better.\n\nIt's pretty impossible to have to have a movie about time travel without a complex, mind twisting plot. \"Looper\" is no exception, but its screenplay is sewn very tightly. The story is fairly easy to follow and I never experienced any \"hey, wait a minute\" moments. It often presents its scenes from an angle that one wouldn't expect, and trusts its audience to make the necessary inferences, rather than adding tedious exposition.\n\nThe film contains a very rich supporting cast, which includes a mob boss played by Jeff Daniels, who proves with this performance why he's one of the most underrated actors alive, a desperate and pathetic thug played by Noah Segan, and a tough but deeply troubled farmer played by Emily Blunt. But by far the scene-stealing performance is by Pierce Gagnon, who plays Blunt's 10 year-old son. Without giving anything away, Gagnon's character is revealed to be the critical element to the film's success. He is asked to play a child with many faces and dimensions, and likely has the most challenging performance ever given to a young actor; he nails every aspect of it. If there is any justice in this world, an Academy Award nomination is headed his way.\n\nWhat sets \"Looper\" apart from most science fiction thrillers is how it writes and utilizes its characters. Every character, from the primary to the lesser is given strong development and a deep personal conflict. Nobody emerges as the clear hero or the villain, and because everybody has a stake in the story, you are constantly torn over who to root for. Sometimes that can work against a film, but not here. \"Looper\" is not afraid of taking risks, and the plot goes into several areas that many other films would and have stayed clear of.\n\n\"Looper\" begins as a very cold and basic film about gangsters and violence. And while it did well on that front, it quickly evolves into an absorbing multi-layered drama about morals, passion and the lengths people will go to in order to protect the people they care about. It's brilliant, innovative and one of the best films of the year."}
{"text":"Hope Springs\n\nStories often end in marriage, but few movies are actually about marriage, about what happens to people and relationships years down the line. Yes, there are lots of adultery movies - they don't count, as the main action in those takes place outside the marriage, after all. (That's why it's adultery.) But movies about the interpersonal dynamics of a marriage, about how a marriage works and why it sometimes doesn't, are practically nonexistent.\n\nSo \"Hope Springs\" gets credit going in just for taking on the subject, and then it does better than that. This is no lightweight comedy, contrary to some of the movie's cheerful and airy publicity photos. There may be laughs in it, but by and large \"Hope Springs\" is about as hilarious as an angry, stone-faced Tommy Lee Jones at couples counseling: funny in theory, but in practice, unsettling.\n\nIn fact - this is its chief virtue - \"Hope Springs\" borders on unsparing. In a pre-credits sequence, Meryl Streep is shown in a nightgown, fluffing up her hair and getting ready to go to her husband. She finds him sitting in his separate bedroom reading a golf magazine, and when she suggests (without coming out and asking) that they have sex, he begs off, saying, \"I had pork for lunch.\" Again, that's almost funny, perhaps even enough to laugh, but neither Vanessa Taylor's screenplay nor David Frankel's direction forces the humor. They stay focused on this moment and others as examples of what can happen to love after 31 years of marriage.\n\nAnd not just love, but life, joy, conversation, hope. The marriage in \"Hope Springs\" is like the last weigh station before the grave, with silent breakfasts, no physical warmth and evenings spent with the wife puttering in the kitchen while the husband falls asleep watching the Golf Channel. If anything, the filmmakers lay it on too thick, but then there was no way Streep wasn't going to make the wife's despair felt, or that Jones wasn't going to turn the husband into the sternest, most intractable and least smiling man ever to end up in couples therapy. Everyone involved took the characters and their dilemma seriously, and that's a good thing.\n\nStreep is a marvel - she always is. She creates a portrait of a sheltered woman with grand yearnings, without much experience and few adventures, but she definitely wants something - nothing specific, just something rather than nothing. Like an anniversary present that's more personal than a new water heater.\n\nBut in the end, this is really Jones' movie, and the drama takes place inside him. He's the one who makes us wonder, and he's the one we watch. In retrospect, both Frankel and Jones show a real command of the film's tone, in that Jones is able to take his character right up to the edge: Just a little more nasty, just a little more cold, and the movie would collapse. We would stop having hope for this guy, stop seeing the movie as emblematic of some marriages in general and start seeing it as depicting an isolated example of a rotten husband.\n\nSkillfully and with delicacy, Jones shows the person under the hard shell, not the whole person - people can't be revealed so easily - but enough so that we don't think the wife is crazy for seeing something there.\n\n\"Hope Springs\" is not about the big horrible things that happen to people, like death and illness and financial ruin, but the small horrible things that can happen: how people can respond to pain by narrowing their lives, how doing the same job for years, day in and day out, can narrow one's interests, and how getting older and thinking you know how every social encounter will turn out can keep you planted on the couch forever.\n\nIt's not much of a comedy - even Steve Carell, as the therapist, plays it straight here. But it's very effective as a cautionary tale.\n\nThere may be laughs in it, but by and large \"Hope Springs\" is about as hilarious as an angry, stone-faced Tommy Lee Jones at couples counseling: funny in theory, but in practice, unsettling.\n[...] - this is its chief virtue - \"Hope Springs\" borders on unsparing.\nAgain, that's almost funny,..."}
{"text":"\"After I killed 'em, I dropped the gun into the Thames, washed the residue off my hands at Burger King and walked home to wait for instructions,\" says a voice at the start of \"In Bruges,\" the first feature by the Irish playwright Martin McDonagh. The voice belongs to Colin Farrell, who plays Ray, a hit man fresh off his first assignment, which he has botched in the worst way. As an unseen Ray speaks, images of the medieval Belgian city of Bruges pass across the screen, squeezing together the ageless and the banal into the tightest space possible.\n\nThis is what McDonagh, whose seven plays -- two black comedic trilogies and a dark fantasy -- were famously written in a period of months more than a decade ago, is known for doing. This and having a well-honed sensitivity to what it's like to be a foreigner in a foreign land, which also sets the tone for the rest of the movie. A dark comedy with a melancholy streak and punchy sense of humor, \"In Bruges,\" which opened the Sundance Film Festival and follows McDonagh's Academy Award for a short film, gives us a couple of Englishmen in exile, lowlifes in a city once considered \"the Athens of the North,\" a pinnacle of civilization.\n\nRay is in Bruges with his mentor-in-crime, Ken (Brendan Gleeson), on orders from their London boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), who still recalls the city fondly from time he spent there as a boy. Ray and Ken, however, have no idea why they're there or what they're expected to do next. Ray wants to leave as soon as he arrives, though it's clear that other things he'd rather not talk about weigh even more heavily on his mind. As they wait for Harry's call, Ken takes the opportunity to do some sightseeing, but Ray couldn't be more miserable. \"Do you think this is good?\" he asks Ken as they float along the canals admiring the buildings, \"going 'round in a boat looking at stuff?\"\n\nRay's petulant philistinism in the presence of ageless, timeless, perfectly preserved and thoroughly exploited beauty is funny. It also gives Farrell (and McDonagh) license to be as giddily offensive as they want to be. The city plays straight man to Farrell's outrageous buffoon, silently rebuking his endless monologues about how the paintings in the Groeninge Museum are just \"rubbish by spastics,\" or how he'd be impressed with Bruges if he hadn't grown up in Dublin but on a farm \"and was retarded.\" Then again, there's something irresistible in the idea that a town criticized for being a living museum would have Russian gun-runners and pretty drug dealers dashing about, selling ketamine to dwarfs on movie sets.\n\nWith his elementary school vocabulary, his shuffling gate and a pair of eyebrows that recall \"The Hungry, Hungry Caterpillar,\" Farrell turns his mercenary killer into a wide-eyed innocent, hilariously vulnerable, if not exactly touching. It's not until he comes across a film crew shooting a Dutch art movie and meets the drug dealer Chloe (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) and the dwarf Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) that Ray's mood lifts and his mind wanders away from the guilt that's been racking him since he left England. (Occasionally, anyway.) Ray is temporarily distracted from contemplating the fate of his immortal soul thanks to the interventions of some obnoxious Canadians and a skinhead with a gun, at which point Ken, who has finally gotten the call from Harry, is forced to make a big moral choice of his own.\n\nGleeson is solid as the fatherly Ken, and Fiennes departs hilariously from type as the barracuda Harry, a snaggle-toothed chav cum country squire. All three performances amount to high-wire acts, ostentatious but pretty dazzling nonetheless. You get the sense that McDonagh wants us to conclude that the enriching experience abroad has led all three characters to a deeper understanding of who they are. And maybe it has. But he stops short of pretending that deeper understanding would actually result in change. As Ken says, when Ray tries to make sense of what he has done and determine whether it means he's going to hell, \"Aside from trying to live a good life, I have to reconcile myself to the fact that I have killed people.\" Should we really be empathizing?\n\nThis is what elevates \"In Bruges\" from glib, knowing shoot-'em-up to something fresher and brighter. As self-conscious as it is, \"In Bruges\" manages to toy with clich\u00e9 while avoiding it entirely. If, as David Mamet has said, the difference between gangster films and film noir is that gangster films sentimentalize the gangster while film noir \"depicts a Darwinian zero-sum world, a world without rules and without judgment,\" then \"In Bruges\" is a film noir in which there is plenty of judgment (including Hieronymus Bosch's painting of \"The Last Judgment\"), but none of it has any real or lasting consequence. As for sentimentalizing its characters, Ray, Ken and Harry each have a code of honor, but the codes owe more to the movies than to anything real. (And anyway, who needs codes when the only people who seem to have them are always running around shooting guns at people?) Toward the end of the movie, when the lovely and very pregnant hotel owner Marie (Thekla Reuten) suggests that Harry and Ray put down their guns and go home, Harry replies, \"Don't be ridiculous. This is the shootout.\" His frame of reference, clearly, is a screen. Marie also says, \"You guys are crazy!\" and you get the feeling she doesn't just mean them."}
{"text":"Summary:\nBased on A. E. Hotchner's memoir, this coming-of-age story follows Aaron Kurlander (Jesse Bradford) as he struggles to survive on his own while his traveling salesman father is away and his mother is committed to a sanatorium with tuberculosis.\n\nKing of the Hill could have been a family picture, or a heartwarming TV docudrama, or a comedy. Soderbergh must have seen more deeply into the Hotchner memoir, however, because his movie is not simply about what happens to the kid. It's about how the kid learns and grows through his experiences.\n\nA far cry from his earlier films sex, lies, and videotape and Kafka, Soderbergh skillfully pulls off what could have ended up as a sappy glob of treacly nostalgia. Instead, the director populates his young hero's chaotic world with genuinely disturbing people, images, and events.\n\nSoderbergh has bathed the Depression in lovely, golden-brown hues - so lovely, so golden, that the flick seems to be unfolding from inside the delicious core of a burnished bran muffin.

{"text":"DVD Review: 'The Liability'\n\nMovies newsletter\n\nE-mail *\n\ndo not change\n\nContact Email\n\nContact Email2\n\nContact Url\n\nSubscribe to Blog\n\nRemember my Info\n\n\"Where in the world has Tim Roth been?\" was the first thought that struck me upon starting his latest film, prompting an investigation into his cinematic whereabouts for the last few years. He had a small part in \"Arbitrage,\" a pretty good film, and dabbled in TV for a couple of years with \"Lie to Me,\" but hasn't really done much else, making it a pleasure to see him pop up here in \"The Liability.\" It's a direct-to-DVD release, which usually indicates that it's not of the best quality, but if you actually give it a chance, you might be pleasantly surprised.\n\nRelated topics\n\nAdam (Jack O'Connell) is a young man who lives with his mother, Nicky (Kierston Wareing), and her boyfriend, Peter (Peter Mullan), a man involved in some very shady business. One day, he crashes Peter's car, which obviously makes him very angry, especially since Adam doesn't have any way to pay him back. He does a few chores around the house, but eventually Peter offers him the job of driving an acquaintance of his around. Considering the alternatives, Adam agrees.\n\nThe acquaintance is Roy (Tim Roth), whom we slowly realize is a hitman. While on a job, a passerby (Talulah Riley) happens to see what they are up to and manages to get away, stealing their car and a bag containing some important items in the process. This prompts them to set out in an attempt to recover their possessions, but as Adam learns along the way, he has bigger problems to worry about than someone having seen him at the scene of the crime.\n\nA lot of \"The Liability\" reminds me of films like \"In Bruges\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" (and the latter's not just because Tim Roth is present in both). Much of the film depends upon the dynamic between the two people trying to pull off a job\/make up for a botched job, though if we were to get specific, Adam is not really trying to help out all that much, but does end up helping a bit nonetheless.\n\nLike in the other films I mentioned, they seem like a bit of a mismatched pair. Before he realizes what they're doing, Adam treats it like a joke (and even later on, he picks up this attitude again). All the while, Roy is as serious as he can be about the whole matter. However, the two eventually come to an understanding of each other. It may take a while to get to that point, especially with all the craziness that happens in between, but when it happens, it's an intriguing moment.\n\nThe first two acts of the film are rather well written, tightly paced, and very engaging. As I mentioned, a lot of it depends upon the dynamic of these two characters, and that's exactly what keeps the film so engrossing. On top of that, you have an intriguing plot that keeps you guessing as to what could possibly happen next. It starts off as a kind of road film as Adam and Roy drive across England, for what, we don't quite know, but then things get rather interesting when we find out.\n\nYou also get a fair amount of tension when the witness to their crime gets away, a tension that flows through the second act of the film as well as they try to locate and retrieve their stolen items. This continues to build as more secrets are revealed. However, things begin to take a rather strange turn as it heads into the third act, which is where most of the film's problems reside.\n\nWhereas the first two acts are well written and tightly paced, the third act felt like a bit of a slump as random bits of plot are thrown in in an attempt to spice it up. For instance, there's the random inclusion of a sex trafficking ring that the witness was trying to track down in order to locate her sister. This eventually leads closer to home, but it couldn't help feeling like a random inclusion to the plot, especially when it's not expanded upon very much.\n\nSpeaking of random parts of the plot, there were also several random instances of characters being able to find other characters inexplicably. By my count, this happened three times. The pacing also seemed to get a bit languid here, giving this act the feeling of being stretched out a bit in order to fill up some more time. This was a shame given that the first two acts were put together so well, but luckily it doesn't take away too much from how enjoyable the first part of the film is.\n\nIt's rather surprising to find a film of this quality as a straight-to-DVD release. My first reaction to receiving such a release is to recoil and prepare myself for a bad film that wasn't deemed worthy enough of being presented in a theater. However, merely 10-15 minutes into the film, I found myself already absorbed by the story. This is something that I always take as a good sign, especially since I consider the story the most important element of the film.\n\nLooking at the technical specs, the video is presented in a 2.40:1 widescreen transfer that delivers a crisp picture despite the overall murkiness of the film. A lot of it takes place in dark or hard to light locations, but the picture always remains very clear. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio is quite lucid, though you may have to turn it up a bit to hear it. The only difficulty the audio presents is in trying to understand the sometimes thick English accents. Other than that, there aren't any problems to be found.\n\nAs far as special features go, the only one the disc comes with is a featurette entitled \"Making The Liability with Cast and Crew Interviews.\" It may be the only extra included on the disc, but this 33-minute featurette covers a lot of ground. It's not really a \"making of\" in regards to how the film was made, though it does cover a little about how the project came about, but more so an examination of the various characters by the cast and crew. It's definitely worth a watch, especially if you end up enjoying the film.\n\nDon't let the direct-to-DVD status of the project fool you. \"The Liability\" is a film that has a decent amount of entertainment to offer, particularly with the story and characters, and when you combine that with the interesting special feature, you get a DVD that's easy to recommend. It just goes to show that sometimes decent movies get swept under the rug"}
{"text":"Eraserhead Review\n\nI've been wanting to see Eraserhead for a couple years now, but things always got in the way. I've finally seen it, and, yes, I'm totally confused but also amazed.\n\nThe imagery, the photography, the lighting, the visual and special effects, and even the sound were all incredible. It's hard to make sense of exactly whats going on, but the individual scenes are presented in a way where you can understand them. The way shots are given to the audience is executed with perfection. The ideas are presented and its up to the watcher to decipher what it means.\n\nI thought the movie on a whole was excellent. I don't understand the meaning, but I do understand every feeling and idea that was meant to be conveyed by each scene. Most of the time I was watching, I was saying in my head \"wtf is going on?\" but at the same time my mouth was dropping open, I was laughing, I was being disgusted, I was being horrified, and I was being amazed."}
{"text":"NOTE: Showtimes are currently unavailable for this movie\n\nFind Dinner\/Drinks Nearby\n\nPart political procedural, part seamlessly re-created time capsule, Pablo Larrain's \"No\" re-visits Chile in 1988, when brutal dictator Augusto Pinochet -- under pressure from the international community -- held a plebiscite on his leadership, which he had seized in a coup in 1973.\n\n\"No\" follows the quixotic advertising campaign mounted to remove Pinochet from power. Gael Garcia Bernal stars as Rene Saavedra, a brash young advertising executive who masterminds a media strategy that infused an inherently negative word (\"no\") into a vote for progress, optimism and change. Using the anodyne motto \"Happiness is Coming,\" Saavedra co-opts Madison Avenue ad strategies to create a down-with-dictatorship\/up-with-people campaign, replete with peppy musical numbers, idealized tableaux of pretty people in telegenic settings and, almost always, at least one winsome mime.\n\nSaavedra's boss happens to be working for Pinochet's campaign, and his estranged wife, Veronica (Antonia Zegers), is a radical activist who insists that the plebiscite is just an empty exercise, rigged to legitimize a reign of terror that included murders, kidnappings, exiles and \"disappearances.\" Played by Bernal with somber reserve, Saavedra glides through the tensions of his life with cipher-like diffidence, hanging back meekly when Veronica is being beaten by police and quietly accepting her inconsistent presence with him and their young son.\n\nSeen through one lens, Saavedra is a metaphor for Chile itself, the embodiment of the very passivity and fear that he's trying to banish in a series of catchy 15-minute ad montages every night before the vote. But that might be reading too much into what is essentially a simple, uncomplicated retelling of events, albeit one made more aesthetically compelling by Larrain's use of 1980s-era video technology and the appearance of real-life ad campaign actors. The result is one of the most naturalistic, spontaneous-looking period pieces in recent memory -- one that isn't afraid to look as bad as the era's cheesiest visual culture (\"No\" is full of flares, glares and awkward cuts endemic to the proto-video age).\n\nSome wags have called \"No\" a mash-up between \"Mad Men,\" \"The War Room\" and \"Missing,\" but it doesn't quite achieve their brio or haunting power. Still, it's an intriguing artifact, and Larrain is sophisticated enough to embrace and let stand Saavedra's indeterminate position between social change agent and slickster. He's so unforthcoming that it's difficult to decide whether he's hopelessly shallow or shrewdly un-threatening, but by the film's tumultuous final scenes, his ambivalence is clear. \"No\" isn't nearly as definitive or declarative as its title: It leaves viewers wondering whether they should cheer, shrug or shake their heads"}
{"text":"Cast Away\n\nA funny and telling thing happened while watching \"Cast Away\" the other day. There were a couple of instances where Tom Hanks' character, a FedEx systems engineer named Chuck Noland, becomes injured in the water and starts to bleed. Immediately everyone around me tensed up and collectively muttered \"Oh no, sharks.\"\n\nIt's amazing how much film has influenced the way people view real life. Thanks to \"Jaws\" and all the fin flicks that followed, audiences have come to believe that every time someone bleeds in the ocean, a shark will magically appear. It's a cliche, best left suited to pulpy films like \"The Beach\" with Leonardo DiCaprio. Sharks are usually a suspense device used when the filmmakers don't trust their story and characters enough.\n\n\"Cast Away\" is different. The filmmakers' trust us, even respect us, and never go for the obvious. There isn't a shark to be found in \"Cast Away.\" Nothing magically happens in this film. Everything is earned. \"Cast Away\" is smart, and funny, and ultimately amazing.\n\nIt features a towering performance from Hanks, who has never been better. He delivers a performance filled with courage, wonder and complete conviction. There isn't a dishonest emotion in his delivery. You believe in his character, and share in his adventure and disappointment.\n\nLike most people who work in high-pressure jobs, time is money to Chuck Noland. At FedEx, it is Noland's job to make sure that everyone is working at their peak so that the packages get delivered on time. When we first meet Noland, he's rallying a group of Russian employees, convincing them that every minute they waste is a minute lost forever.\n\nNoland's life is as exact as the second hand on a clock, a fact not lost on those who share his world. They admire his drive, but wish he would occasionally stop and smell the roses. Especially fiancee Kelly Frears, an understanding undergraduate who finds it hard to stay mad at Noland, even when he has to interrupt Christmas dinner to baby-sit a plane to South America.\n\nTime catches up with Noland when the plane crashes into the ocean, killing the crew and sending him spiraling into the churning sea, eventually washing up on a deserted island. Relying on his wits and instinct, Noland creates a makeshift, temporary home. As the days turn into months, his hopes of being rescued vanish.\n\nWriter William Broyles does a remarkable job of making all of this matter. He avoids the pathos and melodrama of \"The Blue Lagoon.\" What he delivers is a detailed road map that takes us on a journey filled with real life observations and reactions. His observations are so precise that it allows director Robert Zemeckis the opportunity to use cinematic shortcuts without sacrificing the integrity of the story.\n\nOnce Hanks firmly establishes Noland's survival instincts, we leap four years into the future. The brilliance of Broyles' script and the film in general is that we don't need to see Noland go through the motions for four years. We know he will adapt, and indeed the next time we see him he looks like a seasoned survivor. His hair is longer, he's 50 pounds leaner, and resembles a modern day Robinson Crusoe.\n\nA lot has been written about how Hanks lost the weight for the film's third act, and indeed the physical transformation is remarkable. Hanks doesn't stop there. He not only looks like a different man, he acts like a different man. His eyes show us someone who has lived through four difficult years. We believe that this man has changed, that he has gone through a personal metamorphosis.\n\nThe sincerity of Hanks' performance makes everything he says and does matter. Hanks hardly speaks during the film's second act, yet his action say more than words ever could. There's real joy when he learns how to make fire, and honest sympathy for his only companion, a volleyball named Wilson. It's a testament to Hanks strength as an actor that the bond between Noland and Wilson is not only believable, but vital.\n\nZemeckis captures all of the wonder and beauty with a meticulous eye. There isn't one wasted frame in the film. It's truly amazing how Zemeckis is capable of making epic entertainment that feels intimate. He takes us places and shows us things that we have never seen before.\n\nI truly respect the director for not making this a film of convenience. Noland doesn't wash up on some lost paradise with running streams and wildlife. He washes up on a pimple of an island. He doesn't become master of his domain. He's forced to adapt.\n\nZemeckis is blessed to have \"Forrest Gump\" cinematographer Don Burgess behind the camera. The images are both beautiful and haunting. Ken Ralston's visual effects and Arthur Schmidt's editing are seamless, while Alan Silvestri's score is majestic and touching.\n\nFilled with memorable images, true adventure and a Oscar-worthy performance by Tom Hanks, \"Cast Away\" is a modern day classic. It will endure over the years because it is honest.\n\nThis entry was posted\non Thursday, June 28th, 2001 at 4:03 am and is filed under Film Review.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site."}
{"text":"Main menu\n\nRandoms\n\nPost navigation\n\nI've never forgotten a line that Hank Worden's cowpuncher character says about an hour into Red River: \"I don't like it when things go too good and I don't like it when things go too bad\u2026.I like 'em in between.\"\n\nWorden was talking about driving a huge cattle herd to market across rugged country,\n\nbut most moviegoers feel the same way. They don't like films that are unrealistically happy or silly or dopey, and they don't like films that seem oppressively glum and downbeat.\n\nI can't think of a recent \"too happy\" film that qualifies, but the reason for Biutful's 71% Rotten Tomatoes rating, it seems clear, is that a certain percentage of critics are saying, \"It's obviously very well made and Javier Bardem is great, but it's just too gloomy, dammit, and I won't have that\u2026I want a few more rays of sunshine in my dramas, thank you.\"\n\nWhat they're saying, in effect, is one of two things about their own life experience. Either they don't believe that bad luck comes in streaks for some people, particularly those who lack sufficient funds or cushions, or they know that this happens but they just don't want to go there. I'm a big fan of Biutiful but even I feel that the downish stuff is a bit much toward the end, but I know things can get that way (i.e., I've tasted bad runs in my own past) so I went with it.\n\nIt's an objectively very good movie, and Bardem indeed, as EVERY REVIEW WILL SAY, \"gives a TOWERING performance.\" And that Spanish chick with the enormous nose who plays his troubled wife should also be talked up, though I can't believe Jeff wasn't cringing out of his theater seat in that scene where she's naked on top of that bloated, shirtless brother of Bardem's\u2026\n\nBut, now to the Bilasphemy, I found it kind of bioring. And I do like and respect Innaritu's punishing blunt escalating misery and uncomfortable examination of mortality, and there are some REALLY striking bits that everyone should see this in a theater just to see on a proper screen\u2013 that mummified corpse, those bodies floating up on shore, the bit with the cheap heaters in the sweatshop\u2026\n\nBut even with the ever-escalating calamity and freed of his former screenplay collaborator's multi-story shtick, a lot of the movie just feels like\u2026 Bardem kinda doin' some stuff, drifting around town running errands and having prolonged conversations about his past, and while the narrative of this sketchy fringe dude preparing for his fate and being an awesome dad in the face of it all\u2026 man, I'd be lying if I didn't admit that sometime around hour 3 of Bardem eating cereal with his kids, my eyelids didn't feel like anvils.\n\nWhy is Bardem PSYCHIC in it? And the movie is such that around 110 minutes into the utter solemnity and studied grit, you find yourself asking, \"Wait, wait, wait\u2026 wasn't Bardem communicating with dead souls about two hours ago?\"\n\nYes, MINOR MINOR SPOILER\u2026\n\n\u2026it does pay off in terms of the moving bookends and Innaritu's overall thesis, but for the bulk of a VERY long, punishing movie, to say it gets short shrift is like a MASSIVE UNDERSTATEMENT. Literally there's two throwaway bits where Bardem is doing THE MOST SUPERNATURAL SHIT THIS SIDE OF TRON, and it's just kinda shrugged off and he goes back to being an anonymous black market goods guy.\n\nInnaritu is the auteur that I just do not get the appeal of. I think his movies are pedantic and heavy-handed. They rub your nose in misery the way you rub a puppy's nose in it when you're housebreaking. I got to the \"ripping the head off the chicken\" scene in Babel and just said, \"You know what? I got it, I'm out.\" Left the theater right then and there and haven't looked back.\n\nInnaritu does seem to be engaging in diminishing returns. I loved Amores Perros, and I liked Babel, but he really needs to stop with those movies where everyone is a chess piece moved into the worst tragic miserable event.\n\n\"What they're saying\" and what \"seems clear\" is easy enough to fathom. Just read the reviews.\n\nFor instance: A.O.Scott thinks that Innaritu lacks the commitment and depth of a serious artist, that he goes half-way into serious, then settles for the banal and upbeat. It's all there in the review. Not mysterious at all.\n\nHank Worden (born Norton Earl Worden) (23 July 1901 Rolfe, Iowa \u2013 6 December 1992 Los Angeles, California) was an American cowboy-turned-character-actor. He was raised on a cattle ranch near Glendive, Montana. He was educated at Stanford University and the University of Nevada as an engineer. He enlisted in the U.S. Army hoping to become an Army pilot, but washed out of flight school. An expert horseman, he toured the country in rodeos as a saddle bronc rider. During one ride, his horse landed atop him and broke his neck, but aside from a temporarily sore neck, Worden didn't know of the break until x-rayed twenty years later."}
{"text":"Movie Reviews\n\nIt was really only a matter of time until Quentin Tarantino made a western and \"Django Unchained\" is almost precisely the sort of film you would expect the man to make. That should pretty much tell you right now whether you'll enjoy what the film has to offer.\n\nBrash, stylish, shocking, often hilarious, there is no mistaking \"Django Unchained\" as anything other than a new Tarantino film, although it does feel notably different if only in a subtle way.\n\nTarantino has always been a remarkably confident (some might say arrogant) director. You don't make a searing debut like \"Reservoir Dogs\" if you aren't wholly confident in what you can bring to the screen. But \"Django Unchained\" feels like it has an extra layer of confidence slathered on it, like Tarantino is just sort of strutting around, fully in control of his craft and certain that what he's putting on the screen is pure gold.\n\nIs that arrogant? Maybe. But it's earned, at the very least, because \"Django Unchained\" is undoubtedly the work of a filmmaker working at the height of his powers, cranking out a film that is almost preposterously entertaining.\n\nLike \"Inglourious Basterds\" before it, \"Django Unchained\" is a revenge fantasy. But instead of Jews getting a chance to give Hitler a face full of lead, it's a slave having the chance to kill white slavers as a bounty hunter. In the words of Django (Jamie Foxx) when asked if he enjoys his newfound vocation he replies, \"Kill white folks and they pay you for it. What's not to like?\"\n\nGetting him into said profession is Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). He's looking for a trio of brothers and knows that only Django can lead him to them.\n\nFollowing a surprisingly hilarious (and unsurprisingly bloody) encounter with Django's captors, the duo are off to track down the Brittle Brothers, with promises of Django's freedom following their successful takedown of the bounty. However, once Schultz learns of Django's desire to track down the wife he was separated from, Schultz promises to do what he can to help reunite the two.\n\nThe plot is surprisingly thin, all things considered, but you'll hardly notice because this is such a rich movie in pretty much every other capacity. It's shot gorgeously (Tarantino and his frequent cinematographer, Robert Richardson, clearly have fountains of affection for the way '70s westerns were shot), the score is just as eclectic (and often off-the-wall) as you'd expect from a Tarantino joint and the tone is perfectly balanced, managing to bounce from being disturbing to intense to outright hilarious with ease.\n\nHowever, the real treat of the film comes from where Tarantino always shines brightest: Dialogue and character.\n\nBy far the best part of the film is any time Schultz and Django are interacting with each other. They make a tremendous team and I'd have been happy if the entire film was nothing but the two of them wandering the dusty South, taking down bounties as they will.\n\nRegardless, Foxx and Waltz play off each other remarkably well, with Waltz getting the lion's share of the crisp, sharp dialogue bits. I'm not sure there's been another actor whose delivery of Tarantino's words feels as full of life and energy as Waltz's. He's a joy to watch in every scene. If you felt uneasy by how engaging and entertaining his turn as a Nazi in \"Inglourious Basterds,\" this will be refreshing for you as there is no such roadblock.\n\nFoxx, by contrast, has a much more understated role to play. In the hands of a lesser actor, the part might have felt woefully underwritten, but Tarantino elicits a wonderfully intense performance out of him, allowing Foxx to deliver so much information and emotion just through his intense glares. It's as strong a performance as I've seen from him. I was worried Foxx might feel out of place in the role. He has a look that simply feels \"modern\" in a way that could have been distracting in a period setting such as this, but Foxx fills Django's boots quite capably.\n\nRounding out the primary cast is Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie, the somewhat aloof yet still menacing owner of Candieland, the plantation where Django's wife can be found. Running the plantation behind the scenes is Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), Calvin's house negro. While Calvin is evil enough on his own (just wait for the scene involving a human skull and a hammer), it's Stephen who comes across as the most dangerous. Together, though DiCaprio and Jackson make a wicked team with DiCaprio delivering some of the most unhinged acting of his career while Jackson provides a nice reminder that he actually can act.\n\nAs with many of Tarantino's films, this one has sparked controversy. Some (including the notoriously outspoken Spike Lee) have decried the film as being too flippant with its subject matter, that doing something as brash as release a slave revenge fantasy is simply beyond the pale. While it's certainly a bold move making these sorts of fantasy films (and make no mistake, this is pure fantasy, just as \"Inglourious Basterds\" was), Tarantino's approach is hardly what I would call callous or insensitive.\n\nOn the contrary, he actually goes out of his way to depict just how brutally mistreated slaves were by their white owners. We're shown slaves' deep scars from repeated whippings and perpetual shackles. Runaways are branded by hot irons while others get ripped asunder by dogs. We see the medieval accoutrements adorning their heads and necks. It's brutal, often harrowing stuff and Tarantino never makes it feel exploitive or cheap.\n\nInstead it does a proper job of helping us to understand the rage and passion that fuel's Django's quest.\n\nThat rage is exhumed and exorcised in the film's action scenes. When Django is let loose and draws his pistol, it's righteous anger aimed squarely at the forehead of southern fried evil. But these aren't just stylish bits of gunplay, these are explosions of violence that burst from the screen with an impact and brutality that has to be seen to be believed. Each gunshot is like a small cannon being fired with a resultant explosion of blood. This has to be the wettest film I've seen in years. Squibs don't just burst and release fake blood, they erupt. These aren't spurts, these are waves of blood, as though Tarantino is aiming to stick it to every filmmaker who refuses to use anything other than digital fakery for cinematic blood.\n\nWhat it comes down to is this: \"Django Unchained\" is pure cinema. Yes, Tarantino is still doing his \"usual schtick\" of acting as a sort of cinematic DJ, combining and mixing familiar tropes and elements. But the end product is a work of art that still stands as wholly his own. This is electric, brutal filmmaking that reverberates with the joy of making movies. Tarantino never pretends for a second that this is anything other than a movie that we're watching and the experience is all the richer for it."}
{"text":"Chronicle (2012)\n\nRecently, I've been trying to go into movies without knowing much about them. Sure, I check Rotten Tomatoes scores and see some trailers while at the theatre, but I try to avoid plot information and trailers when I can. Such was the case with Chronicle. It was a film that wasn't even on my radar until it started getting strong reviews, and aside from its most basic premise, I didn't know anything about it going in. I'm not sure whether or not that helped my enjoyment of the film, but either way, I did enjoy the film a lot.\n\nIn a way, there's not much to know about Chronicle, aside from the basics. Our protagonist is Andrew (played by Dane DeHaan), an introverted teenager who decides to start filming his entire life. One night, he goes to a party with his cousin, Matt (Alex Russell), and while there, they discover a mysterious crater in the ground. After investigating its contents with the senior class president candidate, Steve (Michael B. Jordan), the three boys begin to develop mysterious telekinetic abilities. And, as you might be able to guess, not everything goes smoothly.\n\nChronicle does a really interesting job of mashing up elements of superhero movies, teen comedies, horror films, and \"indie\" dramas to make something pretty unique. It plays things straight (well, as much as you can in a movie about teens with superpowers), and it's a lot of fun to see the characters react to their newfound abilities. They don't go out and save people or defeat bad guys. They just play dumb pranks and laugh about it. Of course, things get out of hand (and the film arguably goes too far over the top in the last 20 minutes), but I like that there's never any supervillain to defeat in Chronicle. The conflict comes from the boys' own lack of control, their personal lives, and from the dynamics within their group.\n\nThe \"found footage\" style of filmmaking suits the intimate feeling of the film well. The filmmakers make the best of it, and I liked that they used other types of cameras (security cameras, a fellow student shooting video blogs) to cull \"found\" footage from. The lack of music in this movie is also unconventional, and the substitute soundtrack (which includes a lot of background noise and silence) proves to be quite effective. The filmmakers also play around with the editing, and while the found footage approach may not be completely necessary to this film, it's nice to see the filmmakers use it in a logical and effective way.\n\nBut aside from the construction of the film, Chronicle is a movie that relies heavily on character development. This isn't a \"superhero movie\" in the conventional sense, and there isn't a lot of action. It's important that the audience cares about the three main characters, and I definitely cared about all of them. Andrew, Matt, and Steve are all distinct and have their own quirks, yet it makes sense that they would bond over these extraordinary circumstances. We don't get a lot of backstory, yet we know who they all are. The screenplay, aside from a few cheesy lines, is strong and paints these characters in a believable way.\n\nThe movie also wouldn't work without good actors. DeHaan, who looks like a young Leonardo DiCaprio, has the most emotionally exposed character, and he does a good job of making us sympathize with Andrew, but also makes the turns that his character takes feel (mostly) believable. Jordan, who was great on Friday Night Lights, is very charismatic. Steve is a character who's confident to the point of occasional cockiness, and Jordan does a great job of conveying that while still making Steve likeable. Russell was the weaker link in the cast, but he's still fine.\n\nChronicle is only 84 minutes long, and that feels like the perfect length. It's a really fun time at the movies, and, most importantly, it creates characters that you become invested in."}

It was the decade where I came of age as a film buff, but many of its films that seemed at the time to speak so strongly to my generation just haven't held up that well to scrutiny as years have passed. It was a decade that saw one of the most original filmmakers of the 1980\u2032s, David Lynch, do his most astounding work on television with Twin Peaks. In film, the Coen Brothers hit their stride while a contemplative Canuck (Atom Egoyan) and an insane Dane (Lars Von Trier) reached career pinnacles. Meanwhile, emerging from the British Isles were the classically refined works of Anthony Minghella and Sam Mendes. But it was in the Coen Brothers' America where many saw a mini-Renaissance. Unlike the 1970\u2032s, which produced a plethora of auteurs (Scorsese, Spielberg, De Palma, Coppola, Lucas) who were birthed in formal film schools, the 1990\u2032s saw the emergence of a new generation of auteurs (Tarantino, PT Anderson, Fincher, Spike Jonze) who developed their styles first by working in music videos or by being products of their own self-guided fan-boy obsessed film clubs after dropping out of film school"}

{"text":"Movie Mom\n\nInterview: Writer-Director Todd Graff of 'Joyful Noise' Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah as warring gospel choir leaders, and again he deftly manages to make the audience care about a group of exceptionally appealing characters and fills the theater with heart-lifting musical numbers. It was a real pleasure to talk with him about growing up listening to his mother rehearsing the Hadassah choir in his home and his surprise homemade gift from Ms. Parton.\n\nThe closing credits of the film pay tribute to your mother's work as a choir leader for the Jewish women's group Hadassah.\n\nIt may seem strange, but Queen Latifah's character is really based on my mother.\n\nNot strange at all! I think this is her all-time best performance, and I loved the scene where she tells her teenage daughter a few things about what beauty means.\n\nWhen Dana [Queen Latifah's birth name] signed on to do the movie, I had not even written that scene yet. After she joined, I said, \"I want to see Dana do what Dana does!\" And that's when I wrote that scene.\n\nTell me more about your mother.\n\nMy mom was an amazing woman. She was a housewife but she had a degree in music and taught piano.\n\nShe was a singer and a choirmaster and a community activist. She was always down in the basement at the mimeograph machine running off handbills to hand out. I would wake up and there would be a blind child there and she would say, \"You should hang out.\" She just thought he could use a friend. The bad thing is that it's a lot to live up to. One of the things she did was she had these ladies in the choir over to the house twice a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays for my whole childhood, and she was really tough on them. For an amateur choir, where the most they would do was perform in a nursing home, she still treated them like professionals. The line in the movie where Queen Latifah's character says, \"You have to look at me because Jesus doesn't know where the cut-offs are\" \u2014 that is my mom. She'd say, \"I'm thrilled that you're into it but God doesn't know where the cut-offs are.\" I couldn't get her voice out of my head and this movie really took shape around that voice.\n\nThis is your third film in a row featuring teenagers. What is it that appeals to you about featuring kids that age?\n\nIn all honesty, it just started out, as so much of my life, as fear-based. They wouldn't know if I knew what I was doing or not. My first movie none of the kids had even been in a movie before so I thought I was safe. I seem to have enough of an arrested maturity level that we could communicate well and those stories interested me.\n\nTell me how you go about casting a film like this.\n\nIn my movies, you have to sing and dance so I won't read anyone until after the choreographer has winnowed down the people who audition to the ones who can dance and musically we have narrowed it down to the ones who can handle the singing. So that gets rid of two-thirds. Of that last third, even though I'm a big rehearsal guy and we rehearsed for a month on this, you don't have a lot of time. I don't have the time to break kids of entrenched bad habits. So I look for kids who are as natural as I can find while still having some degree of chops. They have to be directable. Because it is a musical and the musical numbers take up a big chunk of time that non-musical movies don't have to worry about, I can't just have the kid that you discover and has a quality but hasn't done anything before. I want someone who is honest and true and real but can hit a mark and stay in their light and talk to another actor believably.\n\nThe music in the movie, as in any religious setting, is half worship and half performance.\n\nIt's a changing world and the influence of secular music and other forms of expression in sacred music is where we are now. I did a ton of research and I would see huge gospel competitions in 18,000 seat arenas sold out. There was praise dancing and stand-up comics did religious themed material. There still is old-school traditional gospel and there will always be. But I was interested in a character who introduces the concept of change with a character who has to feel in control of everything because she feels if she lets one ball drop everything is going to fall apart. As it is, she's treading water right up to her nostrils. So this is the last straw. She feels: \"If you're going to change what I do in church on top of everything else, I'm not going to be able to take it.\"\n\nQueen Latifah's character has a son on the autism spectrum. What led you to include that kind of disability in the film?\n\nAutism is an umbrella term and a broad spectrum. This version of Asperger's is about the inability to understand social cues and so it makes contact difficult, difficult to connect with the community and with family even. He won't even allow his mother to hug him, even his father in the big emotional moment of the movie, dad can't hug him. That is very dramatic to me and germane to the stuff the movie is trying to talk about.\n\nYou worked with two very different ladies in this film. What was it like to direct Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton?\n\nNot as different as you might imagine! But of course Dolly is her own special creation. God bless her, I worship the ground she teeters on in those eight inch heels. Precious! She gets up an hour early no matter what time her call is and she cooks breakfast for everybody \u2014 pancakes, grits, eggs. I would have a Hershey bar in the afternoon when my energy was down. She came in one morning with four pounds of fudge in Tupperware she stayed up all night making. She said, \"I know you like your chocolate but I don't want you eating that junk! This is made with real milk and real butter and a whole lot of love and if you finish this, I'll make you some more.\" She is real. And Dana is also incredibly generous as an actor, as a person, kind to the extras and the crew. She and Dolly had a love-fest. They were a joy. They're both real church girls, so they share that. They both wanted to make a movie that uplifted people and touched people. They saw it from the beginning as more than a comedy piece \u2014 it was really important to them that the message be evident.\n\nWe had no drama, no complications all through the movie and post-production. It was almost too good to be true. And then the tragic thing is that after it was all over [co-producer] Joe Farrell died. Really really terrible and sad.\n\nAnd Dolly Parton wrote some of the songs in the movie?\n\nShe wrote three songs for the film. She would write them and send them to me with very elaborate demos, full orchestration. And I would say to her, \"This is great but for the scene in the movie you've written a song in 2 and I need one in 4 and you have a walking bass line and I need \u2013\" and she would say, \"Honey, I don't know what you're talking about.\" She can play 12 instruments but she can't read music. She would say, \"If you don't like it, I'll write another one. It only takes me an hour.\" I'd say, \"Why don't we just fix this one?\" She said, \"No, I'll write another one.\" She ended up writing 12 songs and said she would use all the other ones somewhere else.\n\nWhat was your biggest challenge?\n\nThe big concert sequence because I only had four days to film three musical numbers with all the extras and all the backstage scenes, the cafeteria stuff, and kids who can't work full hours. There is not a single real choir in the movie. I cast all those people and put them together. [Music director] Mervyn Warren and I turned them into choirs.\n\nWhy is choir music so moving?\n\nSomeone said that one star is just a star but many stars is a constellation. You can't harmonize by yourself. When you can be part of a whole that creates such a gorgeous, layered, powerful, communal experience you are part of something that makes you feel more connected to the world and less alone.\n\nDisney Lets Merida Be Merida After All Did the folks at Disney bringing this to our attention. This sounds like a more genuine movie than the typical manipulative Hollywood movie fare. If his movie is as funny as this guy is (\"I worship the ground she teeters on in those eight inch heels\")we will enjoy"}

{"text":"Oliver Stone's World Trade Center is the second major movie to emerge this year that literally re-enacts events from September 11, 2001. Earlier this year, Paul Greengrass's United 93 was released, and the two movies couldn't be more different in approach. Where United 93 is an evenhanded depiction of tragic events eliciting unique and personal responses from each viewer, World Trade Center wants its audience to respond in a collective, singular manner, using whatever manipulative tactics it deems practical.\n\nThis doesn't mean the movie is poor, necessarily. Stone has never been known for subtlety -- I think he wields the sledgehammer more than any current director -- and yet he's usually been able to craft a film worth seeing, mostly because his methods are incorporated into an overall boldness of vision. Stone isn't shy about making his feelings known, nor about how obvious it is that he desires big things from his movies -- forceful story delivery, clear points of view, and strong reactions from his audience.\n\nSo what's disappointing about World Trade Center, which centers on the true-story plight of two Port Authority police officers (Nicolas Cage and Michael Pe\u0146a) trapped under rubble after the two towers collapse, isn't so much Stone's tone of approach, which could've been foreseen. It's perhaps the simplicity -- some might even say lack of depth -- of its mission. Ever since the events of 9\/11, America has been addressing the tragedy in different ways, trying to make sense of it, measuring responses to it, learning how deep the wounds are, and what parts of the psyche they've reached. United 93 offered a reflection point after four-and-a-half years, allowing us to recalibrate our view of the subject. Stone's film, on the other hand, isn't going for anything more contemplative than \"remember the heores\" and \"people are capable of wonderful heroism.\"\n\nThose are noble ideas; it's touching that the movie only wants to be a tribute and a memorial. But that makes this movie similar to others lauding the efforts of a band-together rescue mission, or, more broadly, the struggles of underdogs facing incredible odds. It isn't complex material; one veteran of this subject is Ron Howard, and movies like Apollo 13 do feel like the precedents here. Stone, whose previous works reveal some amount of cynicism, isn't Howard, and his attempts to evoke the true heart of Americans comes across less gracefully, with familiar character personalities -- crusty and colorful New Yorkers, down-to-earth working class men, strong and devoted wives -- going through the usual motions of a crisis situation (hang in there, stay with me, I'm not gonna let you die).\n\nAs the movie is based on true events, I began to wonder just how much of these moments rang true. I wouldn't doubt that this is the way we act, react, and talk in times of crisis. I do believe, however, that such moments can be delivered with an honesty, without an oversell that highlights its intentions as drama. Stone strives for cheers and tears by going the extra mile, or two, or three (we're given a slew of heartstring yankers, from flashbacks to visions to humorous, mushy ironies involving baby naming; we're even given an angry ex-Marine to inject a dose of jingoism). At some point, the audience should be trusted to meet the material half way.\n\nStone fares much better in the film's pyrotechnics, and the sections that effectively bookend the movie are awesome feats of production value and special effects. The moment when the buildings collapse is as terrifying as anything I've ever seen on screen. And once the rescue attempts are underway, an urgency develops that very naturally brings to the surface our common faith in the best that people can offer.\n\nBut if World Trade Center only wants to remind us that people have \"a best to offer\" when the chips are down, we're not given much new to take away. In our hearts, we know this and we like being reminded of it, but the specific subject of 9\/11 is still going to hurt for a long time; and with so much to explore and investigate, it's disheartening that World Trade Center can boil down its own exploration of the subject with a summarizing end-of-movie voiceover. The movie means well, and we can appreciate the sentiment; it works on the level of heartbreaking spectacle, but it doesn't add more to our wisdom."}
{"text":"Across the span of his career, director Brad Anderson (2001's \"Session 9,\" 2005's \"The Machinist,\" TV's \"Masters of Horror\" entry \"Sounds Like\") has exhibited a strong, confident command of genre filmmaking that harkens back to a time when horror-thrillers relied on mood and character over more blatant trappings like violence and bloodshed to weave their effective spells. He does it again with \"Vanishing on 7th Street,\" a giddily unnerving offering that gets more mileage from its restraint than it ever could by spelling things out and going for conventional scares (though there is one socko jump-out-of-your-seat moment, too). The plot proper isn't terribly original, but peer beneath the surface and one will find more going on than meets the eye. This, above all else, is where the film should exceed the expectations of audiences who have been trained in recent years by commercial Hollywood cinema to turn their brains off rather than consider a story's or theme's deeper implications. That \"Vanishing on 7th Street\" even has deeper implications deserves to be seen as something of an achievement.\n\nWhen a mass power outage occurs across Detroit\u2014and, one has to assume, the rest of the world\u2014the darkness steals with it the majority of the human population. With the sun rising later and setting sooner with each passing day, three strangers who remain\u2014television news field reporter Luke (Hayden Christensen), physical therapist Rosemary (Thandie Newton), and AMC multiplex projectionist Paul (John Leguizamo)\u2014seek refuge at Sonny's, a corner bar where 12-year-old James (Jacob Latimore) holds court as he feeds the rapidly dwindling electric generator. Struggling to come to terms with the unthinkable as malevolent shadows close in, the four of them eventually figure out the common ground between them: they were all holding or around a light source when the blackout occurred. What will happen to them, then, when they no longer are?\n\n\"Vanishing on 7th Street\" opens with disquieting eeriness, a mundane evening for movie theater employee Paul turning outright freaky and bizarre when the rest of his co-workers and all the patrons vanish without a trace at the moment of a sudden power outage, their clothes and belongings the only things left behind. Glimpses into Rosemary's and Luke's respective experiences at this crucial moment are also indelible, with Rosemary aghast at the sight of a hospital patient in the midst of open heart surgery who is left horrified and helpless on the operating table before he, too, is snatched up, and Luke waking up the next morning in his apartment beside lit candles before stumbling outside to find a desolate cityscape. Immediately, they begin to get stalked by the shadows on the walls and the darkness surrounding them, pulled off with astonishing efficiency through expertly conceived lighting and visual effects far superior to many other CGI-heavy films with notably larger budgets. It, of course, helps that these elements are critical to the story, used often ingeniously to serve the script and the atmosphere rather than as the frivolous, eye-candied main attractions. Nevertheless, it's one of the main reasons for the picture's suffocating sense of paranoia, the imperiled characters feeling that they are constantly being watched by unknown supernatural forces.\n\nKey flashbacks, all of them aiding in the development of the protagonists, are unobtrusive and minimal, but also powerful. As Luke's extracurricular activities are revealed\u2014he is carrying on an affair with his married co-anchor while still pining for his ex-wife\u2014Rosemary's horror in losing her infant son compliments her personal ordeal and James is haunted by a memory of spending time with his bartender mom before she left to find help at a nearby church and never returned. The performances from Hayden Christensen (2008's \"Jumper\"), Thandie Newton (2010's \"For Colored Girls\"), John Leguizamo (2008's \"The Happening\"), and newcomer Jacob Latimore are believable and vulnerable, each one distinct but never made to be orchestrated as the lead or some movie-style hero. This is especially wise once they, too, are gradually swept up by the darkness, their disappearances captured with a startling, matter-of-fact nonchalance that leaves everyone in equal danger and duress.\n\n\"Vanishing on 7th Street\" is a skillful, compact chiller, unburdened by too many subplots or the tendency to overexplain what is going on. A lesser film would seek answers, but screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski and director Brad Anderson are smart enough to understand their film is more about questions. To tidily provide reason behind the events in the story would be a betrayal of its portentous aura. Conjecture and one piece of evidence\u2014the word \"Croatoan\" found written on a wall\u2014linking things to the infamous 16th-century lost colony of Roanoke is provocative while lending further enigmatic inference to the goings-on. Following a middle section that hushes the pacing and the threat before the urgency of the third act takes over, the picture transforms itself into a poignant, borderline-profound metaphor for the mysteries of death and the helplessness with which we fight our inescapable mortality. In spite of the knowledge that all living things must one day pass on, people struggle with the imprint\u2014or lack thereof\u2014they will leave on the world after they are gone. Did they make a difference, or a name for themselves? Will anyone remember in future generations that they even existed? These existential conflicts are, indeed, universal, and the encroaching darkness waiting to pounce on them the moment their light\u2014their very life force\u2014fades is symbolic of nothing less than the grimmest unknown specter of them all. Even with hope more or less gone, they fight. For their survival. For their mark on the earth. That's their nature, and our own."}
{"text":"Somewhat softer of a punch to the gut than the notorious A SERBIAN FILM, with which it shares the Subversive Serbia showcase at the current Fantasia film festival in Montreal, THE LIFE AND DEATH OF A PORNO GANG is no less explicit, though its sexual content may be even more extreme than its gore. Before the bloodshed even kicks in, there are graphic scenes of rape and bestiality, which will no doubt clear the room of more sensitive viewers before the knives and chainsaws come out.\n\nBut then, sensitive viewers wouldn't sit down for a movie with a title like this in the first place, and writer\/director Mladen Djordjevic isn't after them anyway. He has crafted a confrontational film that addresses the harsh realities of Serbia over the last decade or so, through the framework of a pseudo-mock-documentary centering on film school graduate Marko (Mihajlo Jovanovic). The first 15 minutes are so are comprised of his \"video diary\" in which he describes his creative goals and documents his attempts to achieve them around the turn of the Millennium. Unfortunately, he can't find much support for the allegorical science fiction epic that's dear to his heart, so he winds up shooting commercials before falling into the world of pornography. From early in this opening v\u00e9rit\u00e9 section, the turmoil of the outside world peeks into Marko's, from the bombing of Belgrade to the fall of Slobodan Milosevic.\n\nWhen Marko squanders some of his adult-film backer's money, he is forced to hit the road with his girlfriend Una (Ana Acimovic), forming a porno cabaret act that travels from village to village in a Woodstock-esque van. The troupe aren't all necessarily the type that a lot of people would want to see naked, and some are suffering assorted addictions and afflictions, but they're willing and available. Unfortunately, the rural Serbs take to Marko's shows like the villagers did to Dr. Frankenstein's experiments, and soon Marko takes a further step downward into depravity: creating snuff films for a German backer in order to alleviate his ever-worsening money problems.\n\nEven after LIFE AND DEATH abandons the \"video diary\" gambit, there's a loose and improvisatory, but not undisciplined, feel to the way Djordjevic films his story and guides his cast, and he has a clear affection for the misfits who populate his movie and the would-be artistic rebel who leads them. The up-front presentation of their assorted carnal pursuits feels of a piece with the writer\/director's general warts-and-all approach, and as bleak and nasty as the story gets, he inserts moments of twisted humor here and there. Sometimes, they exist cheek-by-jowl with his shocking imagery, as when a young man bids an emotional goodbye to his beloved goat\u2014before bloodily killing it.\n\nDjordjevic is deadly serious, though, in his intent to point out the cruelty and atrocities of his country's recent history. The subjects of Marko and co.'s snuff movies are not victimized innocents, but volunteers who desire to die, and it's the filmmaker's blunt point that their grisly on-camera deaths are escapes not necessarily any less unpleasant than the lives they are departing. One snuffee is an ex-soldier haunted by his participation in war crimes; another is a man who believes the money he'll receive for his sacrifice will help out his granddaughter, who was disfigured by fallout from the conflict. Djordjevic's message is clear: Whatever carnage a director might stage before his lens pales in comparison to the inhumanities committed by our government and military on a much grander scale.\n\nAs such, THE LIFE AND DEATH OF A PORNO GANG doesn't carry the catharsis or vicarious thrills of a traditional horror film; even when the splatter goes over the top, the snuff sequences are more sad than anything else. In fact, LIFE overall doesn't really qualify as a strict genre movie; it's more a multicharacter study of artistic aspiration giving way to simple survival instinct under the worst possible circumstances. Not all of it connects emotionally\u2014there are times when Djordjevic lets things go slack in his pursuit of personal observation\u2014but for the most part this is an absorbing experience. And in a time when worldwide cinema is becoming increasingly homogenized, it's something particularly noteworthy\u2014a movie inextricably tied in with the country and climate where it was made, that couldn't have been produced anywhere else."}

Using the proud ancestry of a Maori family as its backdrop, it tells the story of a man whose inheritance of his retiring father's business coincides with his personal revelation that the life he has been leading as a husband and father of two is a lie. His reluctant coming out and the ensuing fallout is handled with an admirable tenderness, the material providing much of the warmth and sincerity the actors don't always successfully convey. Though it follows a predictable arc and never dares to stray from the safety of its three act structure, the ideas it tackles are moving enough to outweigh the distinctly uncinematic approach they're here given."}

My very low expectations of this film were pretty cynical. The twist which I won't mention was where I thought the movie went completely downhill. The relationship that everyone wants but no one really ever gets. and things just keep falling apart. Everyone knew the dad was gonna die and Savannah was gonna move on from John while he was gone. The story isn't unique, (neither is The Notebook) but it is executed in a way that makes you feel as though you're watching something new. The ending cuts the whole point of the book out so I was also unhappy with that. I was hoping the movie was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books. The story is truly touching with all of life's ups and downs. Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried are very good in their roles, along with Richard Jenkins as John's father.

{"text":"Tools\n\nJohn Waters' Cecil B. Demented concerns a gang of crazed young underground filmmakers, led by the eponymous Cecil B. (Stephen Dorff), who kidnap a Hollywood star and force her to a play a role in their anarchic, shot-on-the-run anti-Hollywood 16mm film. As the movie opens--in Baltimore, as always--the star, Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith) is bitching about crab cakes and having to be polite to the yokels. The city's revenge comes swiftly. Cecil's gang sweeps her out of a charity premiere and spirits her to its hideaway in an abandoned movie theater, where she finds that her new company is an assemblage of snarling misfits: a porn star, a Satanist (she does make-up), a junkie, a gay guy and his beloved, a straight guy who's racked with guilt over his heterosexuality.\n\nGiven the premise, you may or may not be surprised to learn that Waters has again awarded a small part to his friend Patty Hearst, who once upon a time was kidnapped and forced to play a role in the radical scenarios of a group of crazed media-seekers. Does Patty not get the joke, or is her appearance in the film her way of saying it's OK, even she can laugh at her gun-toting past? Hard to tell.\n\nAs Patty once did, Honey eventually comes to identify with her captors and casts her lot with them. And why not? Beyond being a bunch of cool wackos who have lots of goofy fun, they're just the opposite of the rich, jaded Hollywood types she knows too well. These kids are passionate about cinema. Their makeshift studio-cum-hideout is a combination of Che Guevara, Peter Pan and Norma Desmond's derelict manse in Sunset Boulevard. They've even tattooed themselves with the names of their favorite film directors. The list includes Otto Preminger (Cecil's choice), Peckinpah, Warhol, Sam Fuller, William Castle, Almodovar and Fassbinder.\n\nCecil and his cronies are like the Bonnie and Clyde of oppositional cinema. Berserk with hatred of Hollywood, they stage attacks on its local manifestations (and film themselves doing so): a multiplex showing of Patch Adams: The Director's Cut, the shooting of the sequel to Forrest Gump, a party where the Baltimore film commission schmoozes studio creeps. Rather than Tinseltown's phony, brain-destroying crap, Demented and Co. want to save real movie culture: art houses, porn theaters, the last of the drive-ins.\n\nAll of this is fun and pretty consistently funny--especially for viewers who get the references. Waters stages his daffy satire at an assured clip and gets droll, confident performances from his cast, especially leads Dorff and Griffith, who don't undercut their roles by winking at them. But that's not to say that Cecil B. Demented is a seamless success. In fact, watching it can produce something akin to vertigo: Call it movie-culture cognitive dissonance, in spades.\n\nProblem is, the film's as cluelessly out of sync as Rip Van Winkle. If it had been made 10 or 12 years ago, it would have seemed only five to 10 years out of date. Whose notion of \"underground cinema\" does it purvey? The '60s', of course. And all those tattooed-on-the-arm celluloid heroes? Ditto. I can't believe you'd find many 20-somethings in the year 2000 who know the oeuvres of--much less give a toot about--Otto Preminger and William Castle. Both were cult faves of collegiate cine-nerds circa 1969.\n\nAnd look who's selling a mock-revolutionary pose in making Cecil B. Demented. Not only is Waters 54 years old, but he's now as much a part of the system as his fellow Baltimorean Barry Levinson. (Cecil B. Demented comes to us from USA Films, which is owned by Universal.) Who does he think he's kidding? The most giddily clueless thing about the movie is that it seems to think it's a barb that will sting the gilded hide of Hollywood. If it were satirizing kids who imagine themselves as cinematic rebels, when all they're doing is aping the radical chic of 35 years ago (which was a bit ridiculous to begin with), that would be one thing. But Waters' sympathies and allegiances are actually with Cecil B. and his motley crew, as if they bore even a faint resemblance to present-day young film aficionados.\n\nOf course they don't. They're part of an imaginary world in which independent filmmaking--a term never used in the film--simply doesn't exist. Shooting on 16mm? That's so retro, too, at a time when any would-be auteur can pick up a mini-DV camera and make a feature. In fact, all of Cecil B. Demented's reference points for \"radical\"--tattoos, gays, porn, what have you--are now all so thoroughly a part of mainstream culture that the movie's own sensibility ends up seeming barely a step away from the shopping-mall, multiplex mindset it purports to detest.\n\nWhat Cecil B. Demented gives us ultimately is further proof of how some revolutionaries survive, once their salad days have passed, as nostalgia merchants. Still, it's hard not to retain a fondness for John Waters; from the era of Multiple Maniacs and Pink Flamingos on, his love of sleaze and bourgie-tweaking sensationalism always had a true believer's guileless exuberance. Of course, Almodovar, one of Waters' heroes, started from similar premises and has continued to grow, turning out films in recent years that far surpass his early work in depth and humanity. But Almodovar clearly was willing to grow, where Waters has been content to endlessly recycle his childhood fetishes and fantasies. If anyone's interested, that's one definition of the difference between an artist and an entertainer"}

But her character does point out a major problem with the \"drug war,\" that things like mandatory sentences, long-term no-parole prison time, and \"three strikes and you're out\" penalties are really just ploys, part of the smokescreen the politicians use to rack up convictions so they can get re-elected on their \"law and order\" record, no matter what their party affiliation is.

{"text":"Scottish princess Merida defies her parents by perusing an interest in archery, but inadvertently jeopardizes her father's kingdom in the process.\n\nBrave (2012) | Review\n\nPristine On Blu-Ray\n\nYo\n\nOkay, I'm going to be honest with you. I think I was bit harsh on Brave when it released earlier this year. In my defense though, I had extremely high expectations. It was the studios first non-sequel since Up, it was their first fairy tale, their first story set in an ancient time period, and all of that just sent my expectations through the roof. A friend put it best, so far as feelings about Brave after it released; \"It's like having a child that gets straight A's all the time, and one day they come home with a B+. It's not a bad grade, but it's just not what you're used to seeing.\" I thought Brave was a letdown because it wasn't another A, but the fact of the matter is it's a pretty darn good, fun, heart-felt, entertaining movie. Watching it on Blu-Ray, removed from the ridiculously high expectations of its summer release, made me realize what a good film it is. It's not the pinnacle of what Pixar has achieved, but it's still far and above the rest of the competition.\n\nI also think one reason why the film didn't really connect with me is because it's a story about mothers and daughters. My wife was equal parts moved and horrified by the film, but then, she has two daughters and more than anything, she just wants to be a great mom to them. That's what this story is about; a mother wanting the best for her daughter, and a mother and daughter who can't really communicate with each other. I'm a dad. I'm more like Fergus, Merida's father, in the movie. I'm generally looking around with an air of confusion and \"what just happened?\" It's important for dads to connect with their daughters, and I work hard at that, but there's just something special about that mother\/daughter bond that causes more emotion and more angst that just about any relationship; at least, that's my observation. And from that perspective, Brave is a very well done story. There are still a few, minor plot holes here and there, which is unusual for a Pixar movie, and the overall arc of the movie feels a bit formulaic, but it all has that special Pixar touch and for whatever reason, I enjoyed the movie much more the second time around than when it was in theaters.\n\nOne thing that hasn't change, and perhaps has improved, is how Brave looks. It's a stunning film. On Blu-ray, it looks absolutely pristine. Producer Katherine Sarafian said the biggest challenge really wasn't the curly locks of Merida's hair, but recreating the wild, naturalistic landscape of Scotland. It's very organic, with green stuff growing everywhere, and very few predictable lines. Well, somehow Pixar perfectly captured the wild grandeur of that land, and even its innate sense of mystery. This is a rich, lush looking movie that looks absolutely spectacular on Blu-ray; even better than it did in the theater (which I think is partly due to the dimming effect of 3D glasses). This is a reference quality disc, one you pop in to show people just how stunning Blu-ray can look (assuming you know anyone who's still not convinced)."}

It isn't afraid to mix splattered blood and scattershot comedy, bringing forth that kind of compellingly uneasy tone that Hitchcock often used to his advantage.\n\n'Headhunters' has a typically twisty plot regarding a headhunter\/recruiter named Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie, excellent) who moonlights as an art thief to pay for the extravagant lifestyle his trophy wife apparently needs. His MO is classic: he interviews his victims, chats art and security as an aside to the job spec and then schedules them to meet with somebody while he robs their paintings and replaces them with printed off copies. However, it all gets complicated when his latest mark his an agenda of his own and is also having an affair with his wife sending Roger's life into a tailspin of deception.\n\nThere are dozens of twists and essential plotpoints to get through in this adaptation of a Jo Nesbo bestseller. They may all connect at the end but you can't help feeling that it's all a bit far fetched and too neatly tied up.\n\nAs a director, Morten Tyldum is fantastic at setting up suspence and driving us through it with gripping brutality and offbeat humour but he often fumbles the aftermath, downplaying the inner turmoil and keeping his narrative too slick for its own good.

{"text":"WIRES\n\nOTHER\n\nThe Golden Door DVD Review\n\nBy Prairie Miller\n\nThe look and manner of immigrants to the US of any historical time, is a well worn group portrait, a mixture of cautious uncertainty and a self-conscious sense of relegated difference. But rarely has a film penetrated beneath that common, usually stereotypical surface to the acutely individualized fears and conflicted dreams of these nomads of determined destiny, like Italian director Emanuele Crialese's Golden Door (Nuovomundo).\n\nAt once compassionate and multi-dimensional, magical yet unidealized, Golden Door's early 20th century Sicilian immigrants to NYC's Ellis Island are lacking in roadmaps and language, and readily embrace instead collective fantasy and rural folklore. The narrative, such as it exists in minimalist terms, focuses on two Atlantic steamship voyagers, a passionately optimistic peasant from the countryside Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), and a mysterious British lady Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg) trying to reach the United States without too much scrutiny or detection among the Italian passengers. But the real protagonists of Golden Door are the masses of people on land and sea. In a most poetic scene that immortalizes the distance established between those who depart and the ones that are left behind, the boat separates from the shore, abruptly dividing a deeply connected people.\n\nBefore leaving his village, Mancuso buries himself in the earth to commune with his ancestors and be blessed by them, while he muses about coins falling from the sky and covering him. On board the ship, men daydream about flying donkeys who scatter money across the new land, while rivers of milk flow through an imagined California as giant carrots float by reconceived as life rafts. Lucy's issues are less fanciful, as she deflects gossip and stares directed at a woman who dares to travel alone and live unpossessed by men.\n\nGolden Door is a cinematic treasure, dipped in the delights of magical realism and the enchanting dual consciousness of cultural relativism. And while these fearless wanderers also suffer the plight of rejection, disappointments, emotional isolation and imposed conformity, the moments of utter amazement like unfamiliar bread that tastes like clouds, possess inspired revelations that we understand will surely sustain them. In any case, those whose prophetic rivers of milk don't engulf them"}
{"text":"Gone with the Wind (1939)\n\n(148th - 7.9 - 6-Excellent)\n\nSo this is Gone with the Wind? I've heard so much about this film: about how it's the greatest love story of all time, how it's the epic to end all epics, how there is nothing like it in the history of cinema. It's not just well placed here in the IMDb Top 250, it's also fourth on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest films of all time. It swept the Oscars in 1939, leaving with no less than ten of them. So why is it so highly regarded by all and sundry? Well now that I've finally seen it I can understand why, but there's also a massive and fundamental flaw that I just can't get past, which means that I don't see how I can give it a Classic rating and keep a good conscience. I'll get to this flaw shortly.\n\nBefore I do, I'd like to point out that every actor in the film does a superb job, and as can be expected in a four hour film there are a whole bunch of them. Clark Gable doesn't just act Rhett Butler, he exudes him. Even though he didn't want to take the job to begin with, he does it so well that it's hard to imagine anyone else in the part. It's Rhett Butler that he will always be remembered for, even though by the time he died in 1960, two days after finishing The Misfits with Marilyn Monroe, he had made 67 sound movies on top of his few silent film appearances, and was known throughout the 1930s as 'The King of Hollywood'.\n\nVivien Leigh, the unknown from England who landed the role everyone in Hollywood wanted for their own, is wonderful as Scarlett O'Hara, the central focus for the whole movie. She's believable as a rich bitch and she's believable as the woman who does what she must when she must, and the consequent balancing act between weak and strong is not an easy one to manage, especially for an unknown starring opposite some of the greatest names in the industry. Then again she was dating Laurence Olivier at the time.\n\nLeslie Howard has his own balancing act to manage, juggling between the spineless man and the honourable warrior, and he's just as good as Leigh. His wife, Olivia de Havilland, is whiter than white, too much so, but she makes it almost seem natural. And above all of these superb performances, my personal favourite is Hattie McDaniel's as Mammy, the big black slave who effectively runs the show at Tara, the O'Hara homestead.\n\nThe background that all of these players act against is nothing short of epic. Margaret Mitchell's novel isn't about Scarlett, it's about the demise of an entire nation, with Scarlett merely our guide through the Civil War that caused the South to effectively cease to be. David O Selznick's film covers the same grand scale. There are some truly wonderful set pieces, from the burning of Atlanta to the stunning romantic sunsets to the endless sweeping staircases to the justifiably legendary long pan across the stupendous numbers of confederate wounded. All the way down the line the film is beautifully shot, which has a good deal to do with the production design of William Cameron Menzies. In fact Gone with the Wind marks the first time that anyone at all was credited with production design, purely because what Menzies did went way beyond the old position of Art Director.\n\nIn short, I'm not surprised at those ten Oscars and the rest of the legend. So to the catch. Who the hell am I supposed to care about in this picture? Other than Olivia de Havilland's saintly Melanie Wilkes, everyone in the film is either a pathetic wimp or entirely unlovable. It doesn't matter how much money or influence each has, they're all nobodies and I couldn't care what happened to any of them, least of all Scarlett O'Hara who is truly despicable.\n\nScarlett starts the film as a rich brat who toys with her suitors, then falls for her neighbour Ashley Wilkes who is already planning his marriage to Melanie. When she finally realises that she can't have him, she promptly marries someone else who she doesn't give a monkey's about and isn't unhappy in the slightest when he dies in the war. As a supposedly mourning widow, she falls for Rhett Butler but ends up marrying her sister's fianc\u00e9e instead purely for the money and position. Not only is she a blatant gold digger but she's a blatant gold digger at the expense of her family, which is even worse. Eventually this husband dies too leaving her free at last to marry Rhett. Of course she promptly goes on to make his life a misery in the same way she did her other husbands, even though they manage to stay on speaking terms just long enough to produce a daughter. How a film entirely devoid of romance can be seen as the greatest romance of all time, I fail to understand.\n\nI presume I'm not supposed to cheer at the death of her daughter and the break-up of her marriages, but I did. The happiest part of the film for me was when she finally drove Rhett away too, because it was the first real piece of justice in the film. Of course Rhett isn't much of a catch either, being little more than someone who makes money out of the misery of others. He spoils his daughter to the point of her death, but he does at least care about her. That puts him a cut above Scarlett at least. Ashley Wilkes is apparently a great soldier but he's nothing once the war is over and he's back home. His wife is the one redeeming character but she's just too perfect. She's more of a saint than Mother Teresa, and entirely blind to everyone else's faults to boot.\n\nAdmittedly by no stretch of the imagination could I claim to be a romance fan. I know little about the genre and don't pretend to understand it. However I have seen some blatant tearjerkers and I've even surprised myself by thoroughly enjoying some of them, including such unashamed chick flicks as The Bridges of Madison County. One in particular that I enjoyed recently is almost the polar opposite of this film. Camille was made only two years earlier, in 1937, but it avoided Technicolor, sweeping grandeur and the whole epic scale that Gone with the Wind thrived on. The most important difference is that, while it may not have jerked my tears, it certainly succeeded in catching my emotions and I just plain cared what happened to the petulant heroine Marguerite, who begins the film as a spoiled brat just like Scarlett but eventually finds redemption in love. The why of it is half Greta Garbo's powerhouse performance and half the script that paints her far more vividly in black and white than Scarlett ever managed in colour, but the end result is that it's a joy and Gone with the Wind is almost an endurance test.\n\nI've also travelled through the South, through Savannah and Charleston and Atlanta, and I've had the pleasure of encountering some of the kindest folks that I've ever met right there below the Mason-Dixon. I understand what southern hospitality is because I've experienced it first hand and I appreciate what the South did to make these people who they are. However I didn't see any of this in Gone with the Wind, because instead it was full of spoiled brats who deserved everything they got.\n\nSo Scarlett screws up her life, even with all the chances she's given, and so does Rhett and so does Ashley and so does Charles and so does every other supposed lady or gentleman in Gone with the Wind. Well, my dear, to steal the legendary line from Clark Gable, frankly I don't give a damn. They just didn't deserve any better! I can't feel sorry for any of them, and if they are really what Margaret Mitchell's South was all about then why the heck didn't the Yankees start the war a couple of hundred years earlier and save everyone the trouble?\n\nTo be fair I should point out that I haven't read Mitchell's source novel. However I presume that while this flaw probably lies with the novel rather than Selznick's film, it still doesn't excuse it. It's still there and we still get to suffer from it."}
{"text":"BLACK SWAN Movie Review\n\nIf there's one type of movie that I'm usually not a fan of, it's psychological thrillers. I don't know what it is about them, I guess I can't really be pulled into a movie that I can't relate to. I'm not a paranoid schizophrenic, I don't know what it's like to be one, and it's rare I watch a movie that displays someone with a mental disorder that I can understand. I feel like Darren Aronofsky's \"Black Swan\" is a rare occasion where a psychological thriller works for me.\n\nThe story follows a young ballerina, Nina (Natalie Portman), who is elected to be the star of a New York ballet remake of Swan Lake, renamed Black Swan. It takes the idea of Swan Lake and adds both the pure, White Swan, and the evil, Black Swan. It is quickly established that Nina has a mental disorder, and as the plot progresses, her mental state deteriorates and finally crumbles as the stress of being the star ballerina overwhelms her.\n\nThe reason this movie worked so well to help me understand what it's like to be in the mind of a disturbed young woman was because it takes her perspective throughout the film. What I mean by that is, whatever Nina sees, you see. Whatever Nina experiences, you experience. The film is about following her from her own mind, seeing the bizarre and often gruesome imagery that she sees in her own head, and never really knowing what's reality and what's fantasy created by her disorder. Natalie Portman's performance in this film is incredible as well. She is a pure, vulnerable, helpless young woman, suffering from her own staggering inhibitions when it comes to socializing, interacting with others and sex. But she is also a dark, powerful, malicious woman; violent and careless and rampantly sexual. The fact that Portman is able to display both of these personalities side by side so well is a testament to her incredible talent as an actress.\n\nBlack Swan sucks you in and leaves you shaken at its relentless look into the mind of a mentally disturbed human being. That to me is what a psychological thriller is supposed to do."}

{"text":"An Analysis of the Great Citizen Kane\nOrson Wells' 1941 masterpiece Citizen Kane has been repeatedly haled as the greatest movie of all time. This is no underserved praise it is quite evident when you watch the film how extremely ahead of its time the movie is. The movie can stand alone in looking just as good as any movie to come out to day with out much effort, just imagine what the audiences of 1941 must have thought when they looked upon this film. This was just the case, people back then had never seen anything so visually stunning and extremely well edited from the many ways it was shot, to the wonderful works of the soundtrack, score, and Foley artists. Citizen Kane has various techniques, such as all sorts of new acting skills, photography and sound experimentation, and a pretty steady switch from the story being portrayed to a well-placed narration. These were used to capture the audience and keep the audience for the entire duration of the film. Citizen Kane is just considered great because of the film it self it's the people that made it and why. The various reasons around the film and all the negative press around it can all be seen as here say because they were never confirmed by Orson Wells or the rest of those that made the film , but it was never denied either. In this paper I will be touching on the true cinematic wonder that this movie really is and all of the social aspects and scandalous drama that this new wave, out of the box film caused. As well as the emotional appeal that this movie had to millions, and still has.\nThe world at the time that this movie was made was a world filled with turmoil and war full of people with better things to think about than what would be gracing their local movie theatre. A perfect time for a person like Orson Wells to come onto the scene and try out his new vision for how movies could be and should be. With this movie...\n[continues]"}
{"text":"Review: Rabbit Hole belongs to Nicole Kidman\n\nWith a title metaphorically hinting at a phrase from Alice's adventuresin Wonderland, Rabbit Hole's Becca Corbett (Nicole Kidman [ Images ]) skirts several stages of K\u00fcbler-Ross principle to arrive uninterruptedly at the last.\n\nShe accepts mortality and the fact that her four-year-old had been killed. Throughout she tries hard, very hard to deal with the loss.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the plot doesn't concern the tragedy itself as much as its aftermath which shatters and disintegrates the Corbetts, a middle-class suburban couple who find themselves in difficult situations they never expected could touch their easy lives.\n\nRabbit Hole stays away from maudlin situations that could have so naturally arisen from a tragic event such as death. It does retain the shock, the shaken feelings and constantly juxtaposes it with the sentiments of 'moving on', that no matter how painful a situation is, time marches on and so should you.\n\nIn a scene that embodies, in part, some of the film's central ideas, Becca's mother advises her that grief is like a brick, \"At some point, it (pain) becomes bearable. It turns into something that you can crawl out from under and... carry around like a brick in your pocket. And you... you even forget it, for a while. But then you reach in for whatever reason and there it is.\"\n\nDirector John Cameron Mitchell takes his characters deep into an emotional abyss, the last point of human suffering and sets them against one another.\n\nFor instance, while Becca gets into a mysterious connection with her son Danny's killer, her husband Howie (Aaron Eckhart) develops a rather playful bond with a fellow griever at a group therapy session.\n\nIn that sense, Rabbit Hole is not puerile, it is rather tasteful and restrained, especially in terms of its characterisation. Kidman pumps dignity into Becca. It's a singular act, unforgettable and well-poised, that in a way characterises Rabbit Hole.\n\nIn films attempted in the past on similar themes, ranging from Robert Redford's extraordinary drama Ordinary People to the strictly ordinary Reservation Road, you'll notice that they aren't driven by a single performance; instead, it's the film in toto.\n\nIn the case of Rabbit Hole, Kidman owns it, single-handedly. Her foibles are visible, her pain is deep and she's constantly struggling between the world inside her and the one outside, in which there are various relationships to maintain and nurture. She does not resort or depends on loud display of bitter weeping, howling or rage. She remains understated and effective.\n\nThere aren't too many plot turns and twists, either. Mitchell keeps it straight and concentrates on how the characters would react instead of how the story would react. It, indeed, helps to have the screenplay based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning play.\n\nKidman, also a producer on Rabbit Hole, somewhere mentioned that it's a film with a message -- that walking through something you think unbearable is possible. It wouldn't be wrong to say she makes it look utterly possible."}

{"text":"Summary:Margot at the Wedding is a sharply observed portrait of a family in distress. Noah Baumbach's latest project is an unflinchingly honest story about coming to terms with one's family and oneself, a journey that is both funny and heartbreaking. The film stars Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Jack Black. (Paramount Vantage)\u2026Collapse\n\nThis is moviemaking for people who don't much like movies unless they are -- you know -- \"serious.\" It is visually inert. It appears to be taking up small-scaled, yet emotionally resonant issues, but does not actually define them sharply or bring them to firm conclusions.\n\nThis is a wickedly funny and intelligent movie and Nicole Kidman delivers: specific, imaginative and brave (fully using herself without commenting at all on a despicable character to indicate she's not like that). Hers is by far the best leading actress performance of the year, but then that has very little to do with who gets recognized for awards, does it? It's not a perfect film, Jack Black can be funny I suppose, but he's not a real actor and there's no reason Jenifer Jason Leigh (very solid, very intimate) would be with him (Mark Ruffalo where were you?). This Noah Baumbach really has got something going for him.\u2026Expand\n\nWell filmed, well acted, affecting at times, but ultimately a huge disappointment. The characters don't speak like humans do, don't react like humans react, and don't have any motivation.

{"text":"What It's About:\n\nThis colorful, pulse-pounding war epic recreates a famous battle from 1879 in Natal, where four thousand Zulu warriors descended on a small outpost, Rorke's Drift, housing just 140 British soldiers. Facing certain slaughter, senior officer Lt. John Chard (Baker) and his second-in-command, Lt. Gonville Bomstead (Caine) still decide to make a stand. Through sheer guts and cunning, they withstand brutal attacks from an enemy with vastly superior numbers. But just how long can they hold out?\n\nWhy I Love It:\n\nEndfield's breathless depiction of a rag-tag English force battling an implacable enemy remains one of our very best war films. Baker (who co-produced) was never better, and got his mystified Zulu extras to cooperate only after showing them an old Gene Autry Western, which helped them understand the nature of acting. In one of his final film appearances, Jack Hawkins registers as a fanatical priest, and you can almost see the word \"star\" emblazoned on Caine's forehead. Like the heroes it portrays, the stellar \"Zulu\" richly earns a chestful of medals."}
{"text":"Tuesday, July 1, 2008\n\nThe Man from Earth\n\nImagine if a man from the Stone Age was inexplicably gifted with immunity from aging, and just kept on living until the present. That's the premise of the The Man from Earth, which I watched last night on my laptop (with any feelings of guilt evaporated by the movie's producer, who has thanked people who've raised its profile by distributing it over the internet).\n\nThe movie tells the story of a man who was born 14,000 years ago and survives until the present day, currently living as a professor under the name John Oldman (note the clever pun!). He moves from place to place assuming various identities every 10 years or so, or whenever people start to notice that his appearance hasn't aged a day. When his colleagues throw an unexpected farewell party and pressure him to give an explanation for his sudden departure, he gives in and takes the risk of revealing his identity to the stunned group.\n\nA very clever premise! In fact, half of the appeal is in the concept, the idea of someone who's lived for thousands of years, an idea which they take and explore for 90 minutes. The entire movie takes place in a small house, and plays itself out through intelligent conversation among the group. Yes, they take that mind-blowing premise and milk it into a long conversation.\n\nPerhaps this would have been a very different movie if it had the proper budget of a major studio motion picture. But would it be better? Take, for instance, The Island, which took an awesome idea and buried it deep under thick layers of action and special effects. No, this movie isn't the slightest bit interested in the glitz and adrenaline. It just wants to take its idea and get you thinking about the possibilities. What if this guy was a disciple of Buddha? What if he was friends with Van Gogh? What if-- and this is the real bombshell-- what if he was Jesus? All this talk doesn't lead to anything significant, but it's fascinating with the way it tugs at the imagination in all sorts of directions.\n\nThe idea of taking an impossible concept and elucidating it to tickle the mind reminds me of The World Without Us, a \"speculative fiction\" book by Alan Weisman, exploring what would happen to the environment if the human race suddenly disappeared-- how houses would deteriorate, cities would crumble, and lifeforms would evolve on an Earth without people. Well, no I haven't actually read this book, but it's a very cool concept. Just think of it, and the conversation it could make."}

In reality, black soldiers weren't allowed to bear arms until the shortage of white recruits, as was recalled in Edward Zwicks's 1989 film Glory.\n\nThe question is asked by Lincoln as though he were Shakespeare's Henry V mixing with his troops before battle, only for the centre of the struggle to be shifted almost exclusively to Washington.\n\nIt's close to a one-man-show, with the great contortionist Daniel Day Lewis proving perfect as the tall, crook-backed politician who proved a master of the Machiavellian arts.\n\nAmong what seems to be a cast of thousands, Spielberg concentrates on the major players who vied for Lincoln's attention - his \"mad wife\" Mary (Sally Field), their sons and significant protagonists of the era.\n\nThey include his spin-master William H Seward (David Strathairn) who had to promote the ideals of staunch abolitionists like Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) despite degrees of difference in the anti-slavery camp.\n\nIn the finale the principal characters read aloud the words of the 13th Amendment, as though to impress it on the popular psyche - like learning by rote.\n\nNot that it ends there. As with Spielberg's Schindler's List, the epilogue is almost an advert for Israel as Abe tells Mary he would like to walk in Jerusalem before he dies.\n\nAt that moment, we witness not just principles being shaped by the demands of real-politik but Spielberg recruiting the most iconic US president in his personal commitment to zionism."}

We meet David Norris, a Senate-hopeful in New York who's making his second run for office. Just as some frat-boy antics sink his campaign yet again he meets a mysterious dancer named Elise (Emily Blunt) with whom he feels an instantaneous intimacy.\n\nThen things get weird.\n\nGuys in grey and nudging us back towards40Critical Appeal\n\nThe Adjustment Bureau is loosely based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (\"Adjustment Team\"), and it feels that way -- like something short that's been overstretched and made thin. What the movie doesn't trust itself to show is hurriedly described, and much of the abundant, clumsy exposition falls to Harry (Anthony Mackie), an adjustor who, for some reason, wants to help Norris. They rendezvous on boats and in other moist locations, because in an inexplicable, Shyamalan-esque plot device, the adjustors' powers don't work near water. From Harry, we learn that the agents of the Adjustment Bureau are supernatural beings, eons old, who work for the unseen \"Chairman\" (heavily implied to be You Know Who), tweaking the fate of mortals and keeping them in line with the master plan for humanity. Though they've been mucking around with the fate of humans for thousands of years, for some reason, they dress like they had all of their tailoring done in the '60s. Oh, and they have magical hats. Seriously.\n\nThe Adjustment Bureau manages to pull off the dubious trick of over-explaining itself while still remaining woefully vague and unconvincing. The central conceit -- that there's an agency of government-type bureaucrats controlling our fates -- seems tired from the get-go, and the agents' pseudo-technical jargon about \"recalibration,\" \"adjustments\" and staying \"on-plan\" seems mostly intended to make their bromides about fate less pointless. The ending, I'll simply say, is a triumph of vagueness, with a message along the lines of \"We don't control our own fates, unless we do\"\u2026 or something.\n\n60Guy Appeal\n\nAs a writer, first-time director George Nolfi has a solid resume of films that appeal to guys, including Ocean's Twelve and The Bourne Ultimatum. Since The Adjustment Bureau is basically one long chase scene, you'd think it would, at least, be an exciting ride. But it's not. The bad guys really aren't that bad. They're unarmed, even-tempered and though they threaten Men in Black-style brain erasure at one point, the idea is never revisited. Catching Norris is clearly a hassle, and the agents chasing him seem bored with their roles as destiny's hall monitors. Mostly, they just trail Damon and talk his ear off.\n\nWhen the adjustors decide that Norris is a troublemaker and decide to bring in the big guns (a guy they used to call \"The Hammer\"), you might justifiably sit up in your chair and hope for some action. But no such luck. The Hammer (an intense but miscast Terence Stamp) ends up just being an even older and even more humorless guy in a fedora. All in all, the adjustors simply don't do very much -- though at one point they do rob Damon of the girl's phone number. (How do you like them apples?)\n\nDamon has played a hunted man often enough to be pretty good at it (again, see \"Bourne, Jason\"). His David Norris is a likable and understandably confused guy, and the sad-eyed Emily Blunt plays her character disarmingly and with a saucy wit. The two have good chemistry, and their scenes together are sexy and among the best parts of the film. Unfortunately, they barely get three minutes to themselves before they're interrupted by another gray-suited spook on a mission to scold Norris into giving up on love.\n\nThe fact that you're left yearning for more romantic scenes is mostly a testament to the film's failure as a sci-fi thriller. There are shades of The Matrix and Dark City here, but where those films introduced us to compelling characters and pulled us into challenging curtained worlds, The Adjustment Bureau is dramatically dreary and intellectually flat. When it attempts to engage with the weighty philosophical questions of fate and free will, the film quickly finds itself out of its depth and with very little to say. In other words, The Adjustment Bureau would collapse under the weight of its own ideas, if it were able to get them off the ground."}
{"text":"Review: Bound For Glory\n\nThe forces of freedom and spontaneity have a way of dominating foregrounds in Bound for Glory: kids, in closeup, singing a Guthrie children's-ditty whose beat seems slightly out of sync with the mechanical rhythm of the motion their parents make as they stoop and pick vegetables deep in the shot; or Woody himself singing songs of protest in a recording studio while behind him in another booth a trio of radio actors read from what might well be some escapist Depression comedy script (we can't hear their voices but their expressions and gestures are pretty inane). On the other hand, authority and oppression\u2014or at least the powers of inertia maintaining the social and political status quo\u2014seem to mobilize in murky backgrounds such as those we find in a California fruit camp where bosses and thugs mill about \u00e0 la John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath, preparing to break up a hoedown they figure is pretty subversive\u2014a crowd of homeless migrants clumped around blinking fires, making music into the night. Perhaps there's no hard and fast rule at work, but such a visual structuring presents itself often enough to warrant some thought; and the matter of perspective is especially vital because Bound for Gloryis to a large extent about how, in the Seventies, we see Woody Guthrie as a folk hero.\n\nForegrounds and backgrounds matter from his first appearance. The film begins with the title handwritten across an earth-toned screen, and with Jimmie Rogers' singing \"Goin' to California\" on what sounds like an old 78. Ashby fades in on a dusty street whose look is also warm, slightly brown, and almost luminescent. As though there were never any question about how Woody Guthrie should happen into the movie, David Carradine emerges from the background and walks easily toward the camera. As he gets closer, the camera swings to include a group of men sitting around a radio, which we suddenly realize is the source of the Jimmie Rogers song\u2014music which was heard before the movie proper had even begun. Nobody has said anything so far, but already some allusive crossreferencing is beginning to build: between time frames that shift with each new disclosure of visual and musical context, and between a folk hero already fading into the crackle and static of mortality and one walking newborn into the light of day (Rogers died in the early Thirties, the starting point for the film). The movie itself ends\u2014or nearly so\u2014with the real Woody Guthrie's voice, ghostly, similarly imprisoned in mortality, high-pitched with enthusiasm and desperately optimistic, talking about change, personal conviction and perseverance in a hardened world); between the lyrics to a winsome pre-dustbowl song and a quest that will take Woody Guthrie halfway across a continent to Los Angeles and the California fruit camps in search of ideals both personal and political.\n\nAnd there is something offhandedly auspicious simply in the way Woody approaches from deep in the shot towards the camera; throughout the film Ashby will persistently intermingle and layer historical as well as visual planes, creating an interesting double-exposure effect that works on our perception of Guthrie as myth. The sometimes offbalance use of music\u2014unique juxtapositionings of orchestrated score and the music emanating from people on the screen\u2014often adds to this layering of time and viewpoint. Again and again, Leonard Rosenman's panoramic orchestration of time-honored Guthrie tunes tends to become an extension of, or at times a counterpoint to, Woody's own handhewn brand of music, as though that music were somehow pouring out of the Thirties and into the present. In one scene Woody and a fellow railroad bum are perched atop a boxcar heading west. It's a single, tremendously long take emphasizing that a country is passing by behind them, taking us under a steel span bridge, through a long tunnel, making us strain to see the characters through sooty steam that billows around them as they move along in this unique dimension of time and space. Finally, Woody leans back and starts playing his harmonica. Ashby pulls away for a longshot of the whole train, and as he does, Woody's playing gives way to an orchestrated variation on the same tune. Woody has been visually absorbed into this golden landscape, while his music has been adopted (and adapted) by the present, absorbed into the fabric of the film itself. It's not really a big moment, but it has a way of hanging around in your mind, a brief crystallization of feeling and direction in a movie that seems to flow so generously and often so allusively through time, finding connections\u2014through use of music, sometimes parabolic anecdotes, or bits of finely nuanced performing\u2014between Guthrie who's become part of the American cultural and mythical landscape, and the man who actually lived through and sang about hard times."}
{"text":"FILM REVIEWS\n\nMute Witness B+\n\nSundance Film Festival, Park City, Utah, Jan. 25, l995\u2013Anthony Waller's Mute Witness, a witty, unpretentious thriller, is a seductive piece of real filmmaking ripe with tension which should keep audiences hyperventilating to the last reel. Shot on location, well-crafted susp How Get Back Your Ex Girlfriend enser concerns three American youngsters making a movie in Moscow who inadvertently get entwined with the Russian underworld. Pic was presented in Sundance's \"Park City at Midnight,\" but with a shrewd campaign, Sony release can attract a broader contingency than the midnight crowd.\n\nUsing the classic format of a disabled woman in peril, writer-director Waller gracefully borrows elements from such thrillers as Wait Until Dark, starring a \"blind\" Audrey Hepburn, as well as F\/X, placing his tale on a studio set with outstanding movie special effects playing crucial role in the plot.\n\nThe heroine, Billy (Mary Sudina), is an attractive, highly skillful special effects make-up artist, working on a low budget thriller that is directed by Andy (Evan Richards), b.f. of her sister Karen (Fay Ripley). Overly protective, Karen is worried about Billy because she's mute\u2013she can hear but can't speak.\n\nOne night, leaving the studio with her family, Billy realizes she forgot a mask that needs more work. Going back to retrieve it, she unwittingly stumbles onto a \"snuff\" movie, which is secretly shot on the same location. Her colleagues, who work on both movies, claim the murder never happened. As the only witness, Billy's task is to prove her competence\u2013and save her life. What seems at first a simple little thriller progressively spirals in unexpected directions, as Billy and her friends are drawn deeper and deeper into a Russian labyrinth of mafia and terror.\n\nNeophyte helmer has obviously watched many Hitchcock movies, for he knows how important a good MacGuffin is to a thriller's machinery. Waller manipulates the plot with twists and turns based on such icons as a lost key, assuring that Billy is locked inside the studio with her chasers in hot pursuit. There's also a missing computer disc containing secret info about the Russian mafia, which inadvertently gets hidden, adding another layer to the escapade.\n\nSetting Mute Witness in the new Russia proves to be a cunning strategy, for it heightens the feeling of danger, isolation, and helplessness of Americans in alien territory, lacking any command of its language. And it also makes the movie more topical, showing how modern Russia \"follows\" the Western world, including organized crime.\n\nMost of the film takes place within the controlled environment of a dilapidated movie set (the noted Mosfilm studio), where Waller achieves a superlative mise-en-scene. Helmer shows a slippery, ominous visual sense and a good nose and ear for macabre humor, as in a cellar scene, where Billy faces a dead victim in a plastic bag. An outdoor chase scene, though not particularly well-executed, provides viewers with a long shot of the Kremlin.\n\nTech credits in what appears to be a small-budgeter are proficient, with special kudos to Werdin's edgy lensing and Adam's tricky but precise editing.\n\nHelmer Waller is not beyond using generic visual cliches, like swinging doors, locked windows, alley cats, and glinting flashlights in dark buildings. Thriller can also be faulted for being entirely plot-driven, neglecting to develop intriguing characterizations. Nonetheless, pic's suspense is so chilling, its narrative so disciplined and its style so pleasurable that they jointly triumph over the other deficiencies"}

{"text":"Religion can be a sensitive subject, which is why I find it fascinating when filmmakers attempt to shed light or take a stance on issues surrounding it. Typically, one of two things happens\u2013the film is horribly offensive to a large number of people, or the issue is dealt with so delicately that it fails to have any impact whatsoever. Director Nadine Labaki is guilty of the latter with her watered-down, albeit well- intentioned, account of Lebanese women caught in the crossfire of the fighting between Muslims and Christians in her film, Where Do We Go Now? However, she effectively and realistically portrays the story through the eyes of women, who are rarely represented in films of this sort.\n\nThe film begins in a small, close-knit village comprised of Muslims and Christians who work together to keep the town running efficiently. This peaceful existence changes when the villagers catch wind of the warring that has taken place between Muslims and Christians in other areas of the Middle East and the men start acting aggressively toward each other. It's then up to the women to balance everything out. The only problem is that they have to do it without the men knowing. Amale (Labaki), Yvonne (Maalouf) and Afaf (Hakim) band together with women of all ages to devise a plan and eventually trick their husbands into looking past their differences in religion.\n\nMost of what ensues is comical and offers some insight into the role that Middle Eastern women play in the household and town itself. That being said, it sometimes trivializes the actual issue and comes off as either naive or sugar-coated. There are parts of the Where Do We Go Now? that make the situation look like it could actually be fun and silly, but then there are emotionally compelling parts that capture the severity and tragedy of the situation, making it difficult to fully invest yourself in the film or truly care about any of the characters. While Where Do You Go Now? is not quite the substantial or enlightening story it promises to be, it's refreshing and thought-provoking."}

{"text":"Movie Reviews\n\nI haven't done reviews in a while mostly because I haven't seen anything that interesting. Some quick updates:\n\nIt Might Get Loud was quite a good documentary about how rock guitar has evolved over the years. It's a meeting of Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White with background individual interviews and lots of guitar playing. Page produced it. There are a few of stand out moments but the two I most remember were Jack White playing his favorite song, Son House's \"Grinnin' In Your Face\", and the Edge playing a riff with and without amplification and effects. This film convinced a friend to learn guitar.\n\nExit Through the Gift Shop is another documentary, this one about street art, or about a street art documentary. Thierry Guetta is an eccentric character who obsessively films his whole life. He gets interested in graffiti art and follows and films some of the better known ones, including Invader and Shepard Fairey and begins a quest to find the elusive Banksy. Since most of this art is illegal they're a little concerned to let Guetta film, but he decides to make a documentary about them and builds some street cred. At some point the film falls apart and Banksy takes over and edits the film from Guetta's footage (Banksy is listed as the director). It then takes a few more twists. I thought it was a little long, particularly since Guetta is so annoying, but much like The Sixth Sense, the ending made up for a lot.\n\nThe Secret in Their Eyes won last years Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. It's an Argentinian crime noir with a romance thrown in. It opens in 2000 and we meet Benjamin, a retired criminal investigator and Irene, a judge. There was clearly something between them. Benjamin is writing about an unsolved rape-murder case they were both involved with 25 years ago. The film flashes back and forth telling the past story and his current investigation. There are some interesting supporting characters, a great chase in a stadium, some ruminations on memory and love and some funny moments. it's also a little slow at points and a bit unbelievable at others. Still it's the best movie I've seen in a few months.\n\nPlease Give is a small film set in New York City. Rebecca (Rebecca Hall), a mammography technician who's genuinely nice and spends her life taking care of her 90 year-old grand-mother Andra (Lois Smith) who's genuinely not nice. Her self-obsessed sister Mary (Amanda Peet) works in a salon and lives with Rebecca and isn't helpful in taking care of Andra who raised them. Kate (Catherine Keener) and Alex (Oliver Platt) live next door to Andra and have arranged to buy her apartment after she dies so they can expand theirs. Maybe this seems a little less odd as they are antique dealers who regularly deal with estates. They buy low from grieving family members who don't know what the pieces are worth and then sell high in their shop. Kate is a little bothered by this and is always giving five and twenty dollar bills to homeless people she passes in the street, much to the annoyance of her acne-stricken teenage daughter Abby (Sarah Steele). The characters are all a bit quirky which probably stems from depression in a way that makes their one-dimensionality seem multi-dimensional.\n\nI have fond memories of watching Land of the Lost as a kid on Saturday mornings. I'm sure it wasn't very good even if there were episodes written by Larry Niven,Theodore Sturgeon, and Ben Bova. I'm also surprised to learn they did a remake series in the early 90s. Last summer Will Ferrell turned it into a typical Will Ferrell movie. It was certainly ripe for parody but Ferrell just plays Rick Marshall as the same character he always does (so no, this isn't for kids) and the script isn't particularly funny.\n\nHoly Rollers had potential. It's based on a true story of young Hasidic Jews who smuggled drugs into the US from Europe. The dealers used them because custom agents didn't suspect them and didn't search their bags. Jesse Eisenberg plays Sam Gold who's first tricked into it thinking he's bringing \"medicine for rich people\" and is lured in by the money. This should have been interesting but you're never made to care about the characters. Sam is 22 but acts like a whiny 14 year-old. Which is perhaps understandable as it seems he's never even touched a woman and he's just waiting for his parents to arrange a marriage to the pretty girl in the neighborhood. He has no coping skills other than to get angry or stop talking to someone; which is understandable because that's all we're shown his family and friend as being able to do.\n\nAvoid The Spirit at all costs. A friend said it was the worst movie of 2008 and it came on cable and I had vague interest in seeing it because of fond memories of writer\/director Frank Miller's comic book work in the 80s. That was a mistake. Miller hasn't had an original idea in 20 years and corrupts his idol Will Eisner's character. The film has the same look as Sin City (and to a lessor extent 300) but makes no sense, has no life and is tedious as all hell. Seriously, just avoid it (as you were probably going to), it's not so bad it's good, it's just bad.\n\nSplice got some good reviews as an intelligent sci-fi horror film. Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) are biochemists who create a new species which can be used to create pharmaceuticals. To be really useful they need to splice in some human DNA but oddly the company is a afraid the public isn't prepared for the ethical implications. But Elsa doesn't care, she convinces Clive to go ahead with it in some secret corners of their soon to be shutdown lab (how Eve-like). Clive and Elsa are married and he wasn't kids but she doesn't. But now they are raising Dren, an almost girl experiencing rapid aging. They get to go through all the stages of parenthood in a couple of months. Well maybe a few more than the normal stages, this is after all a horror film. It's not particularly gory and this is far from a slasher flick but I never got too engaged with it. It might have been because of the heckler in the audience who wouldn't shut up or it might have been but the constantly dumb things these scientists did that he had to heckle about it. Then there's a big dumb action that I just couldn't get past and it becomes a monster movie in the woods film. Friends I saw it with like it, I think for campy genre fun, so if you're into that kind of thing, maybe you'll like it. Still compared to The Spirit, this movie is Psycho.\n\nI had never seen the infamous Myra Breckinridge and caught it on cable. It's an incoherent mess that isn't worth seeing.\n\nValkyrie was a reasonable attempt at making a thriller out of an actual failed plot to assassinate Hitler. It just never quite came to life."}
{"text":"There are plenty of moments in its 150 minutes when Inception is flying in mid-air, uncertain whether there is a safety net or a parachute of coherent plot to explain its entire exhilarating enterprise. Don't ask to have its theory of dreaming spelled out in foolproof detail, just know that the age-old love affair between dreaming and the movies has been reasserted. Above all, treasure the film's serene lack of exhausting violence or ingenious cruelty. Yes, there is action aplenty, with car-chases and gun-battles, all edited with insolent speed, as if to admit that we all know a chase and a shoot-out are just familiar riffs, shaggy dog stories, the tunes of nostalgia, like Edith Piaf. And shiver a little that Piaf has been used in a movie where Marion Cotillard is the raw-eyed emblem of hurt feelings.\n\nThis absence of \"R\"-heavy violence isn't just a way of letting the teenage audience into the theatres without subterfuge. It's part of the airy sense of play that oxygenizes the picture. Indeed, the thing I like best about Christopher Nolan's film is that with all the attendant prospects of a Big-Time Metaphor (film equals dreaming), and the chance of major World-Ending Political Intrigue, the mission impossible here is as silly and evanescent as why people play golf, chess, or postman's knock. It's just that the game is pretty and passes time in an elegant, harmless way.\n\nSo, projected enemies are shot down, like the phantom figures in a videogame, but all the characters survive\u2014because we are asked to like them, and to admire the spirit with which they play the game. It. You get attached enough to the plucky stance of the dog for a couple of hours, but you could as easily have admired the splendor of the pocket battleship. Of course, this detachability in feelings and needs is very fair to the relaxed and rootless air of dreaming\u2014that aspect of experience (so like the movies) where we learn that the show is everything, so long as it doesn't matter so much that you start taking it seriously and believing it's Life. The deepest link between film and dream is that we are safe in our dark, no matter that the bright hurtling locomotive (the screen) comes so close.\n\nIf you want a measure of the film's wit, of its tongue- in-cheek delicacy, just notice how the intrigue is all achieved in the first-class cabin of a long-distance air flight. No matter the dream's turmoil, these people are cushioned and placed in the most artful bed-seat, gently mulling over the flight's choices\u2014the game hen in cilantro aspic, or the chilled lobster DeMille. There may not be such a dish, except in dream, but I name it to hark back to the impassioned vulgarity, the urge to see new things, that inspired that pioneer filmmaker.\n\nSo don't be put off by the way millions are flocking to Inception\u2014just study the ease with which these audiences are floating over the bits of plot they can't follow, carried along by the witty good nature of the film. And that's the crucial novelty.\n\nChristopher Nolan has tended to be a little gloomy in the past and that sometimes left him looking solemn. What really works in Inception\u2014and means so much to the future of movies\u2014is its grace, its ease, its happiness in being an entertainment and a game.\n\nAs I go back to it, and we all will, I think this truth will emerge, that amid its stunning visions of Paris folding up like a clever box and cliffs crumbling like abandoned tenements, it has the panache of a comedy. Leonardo and his gang do a great job with their inane task, but it could have been Laurel and Hardy getting a piano up those steps.\n\n4 comments\n\nI couldn't disagree more with this characterization of Inception as witty, graceful, light-on-its-feet, deft, fun, etc. These words describe Hitchcock movies. Inception was humorless, pretentious, clunky, and dull by contrast. Far from taking the plot -- Hitchcock's \"MacGuffins\" -- with a grain of salt, this movie is dominated by explaining, in turgid detail with non-stop inane chatter, the particulars of the conceit. The movie spends more time explaining the rules of the game than playing it, and, when it does play it, it feels like it's running out the clock.\nThe following is well-observed: \"It.\" Because of this, nothing feels at stake. We don't care about the wound, the loss, the destiny, and so we don't care what happens, which is necessary to enjoy a movie.\nMy theory about why people aren't bored out of their minds watching bits of make-believe is not that they care about the plot or the MacGuffin, but that they care about the people -- that even escapist entertainment is, in the end, \"character-driven.\" The characterization need not be complex, or literary, or even true to life, in order to capture our attention. We need a reason to give a shit. Often in light entertainment, chracterization comes in the form of, at a minimum, a *personality*. DiCaprio's character lacks personality. He's just a vessel for the silly plot. He's a big MacGuffin himself -- the due diligence, the thing that doesn't really matter. But once plot and character are zeroed out, there's nothing left to care about, and you just want to leave.\nAre the images beautiful, arresting,or witty? Not so much. The dreamscapes mostly resemble banal reality, like a rainy afternoon in an anonymous downtown city, scene of one of several tedious shoot-em-ups. Dreams are actually weird, freaky, trippy. These dreams are not remotely dreamlike. They don't scratch the surface of what dreams, or the unruly subconscious, are like. We get inside human heads and what do we find? Something unsettling, disorienting, intriguing? Nah, we just find another mundane battleground for some action sequence that pales next to Bond or Bourne.\nDo characters crack jokes, or crack smiles? Nope. (Remember, they don't have personalities.) How about the music? Any Hermann-esque style? Nope. Hans Zimmer blasts a lot of noise in rhythmic pulses, as if to say, This Is a Big Deal -- not We Are Having Fun. The love of DiCaprio's life, for the most of the movie, is a demonic presence. The drama of the film -- what little there is -- is downbeat, and surrounds an ugly suicide. Altogether, the general feel alternates between dull and sour. Panache of a comedy? I'm unconvinced that Thomson saw the movie, or stayed awake. Perhaps this reflects his dream version.\nIt injects a little play into the last moment, but of the cliched, chessy sort, like tacking a question mark onto \"The End,\" and serves merely to convince us of what we already knew -- that nothing that happened before was worth caring about.\n\nPeople seem to be split on this one. I enjoyed it. I thought it was a playful homage to multiple past genres, from the one last heist to Freud with a side of Hitchcock (or vice versa) to Tarkovski's slow-motion symphony of memory, dream and reality\u2026there was even an obvious nod to Fred Astaire's Royal Wedding.\nThis dream-within-a-dream tesseract is genre-within-a-genre, Borgesian Noir. More playful then original, it invites, and eventually forces multiple interpretations.It brings to mind Ecos's \"opera aperta\" where meaning meanders freely un-imprisoned.\nThe film itself is an inception a seed where interpretations uncertainty and doubt grow like ivy in the mind. If you let them.\nIt may require an acquired taste, to which naysayers may answer \"so does poo\". I'm not commenting to tell people why they should like it\u2026only why I liked it (and I don't \u2013yet- like poo).\nIn the end for me Nolan wove a entertaining jaunt into hyper-reality, which is everything I ask for when I go to a movie.\n\nWhy is Salt, a disposable star vehicle, better than Inception, a supposed modern classic? The answer lies in the fundamentals.\nCharacter: I said before that even escapist entertainment is character-driven, because caring about the characters is a prerequisite to caring about what happens to them. You like Jolie from the start, and are invested in what happens to her. The same can't be said about DiCaprio's character. Why not? DiCaprio is an excellent actor. But Jolie has the charisma of a movie star. DiCaprio looks and sounds boyish and twerpy and needs strong material to shine, as he did in Aviator and Revolutionary Road. Jolie needs only her easily expressive face and screen presence. Both Salt and Inception begin with the familiar trick of placing the hero in peril from the git-go, but Salt immediately takes a step back to allow the character to project intelligence, charm, and warmth, such that when we're plunged into the action ten minutes in, we're already sold. You could argue that Inception concerns a mystery about Cobb, and the movie has to maintain some distance from him. But Salt even more obviously concerns a mystery about its hero -- is she a good guy or a bad guy, \"Who Is Salt?\" It doesn't matter! We root for her even when the evidence suggests that we should reconsider our allegiance. Inspiring loyalty that leads us to suspend rational inquiry and moral judgment is the stuff of movies and story-telling. You might even say that it's the stuff of love. As Hitchcock, Wilder, and countless lesser Hollywood hacks knew, movies are a romance. Since the wonderfully engaging Memento, Nolan seems to have forgotten that.\nAction: What happens to this character we care about? She's chased. Chases are better than shoot-outs, because they move. They distill the notion of suspense to its essence. The action in Salt is well choreographed and shot -- more sweepy than jolty, thankfully -- and it feels taut. *This* is fun. For all its movement from dreamscape to dreamscape, the actual set pieces in Inception are curiously static and dull.\nPlot Construction\/Length: We don't need to be rigid about this in the manner of Screenwriting for Dummies -- as in, you must have three acts, divided by two plot points. But it's worth noting that Salt follows a familiar pattern and sustains our interest, whereas Inception is ponderous and meandering. Having established a character we care about and plunging her into the action, Salt pulls the rug out twice at well-spaced intervals on its way to a satisfying conclusion a mere 90 minutes later. Done and done. Inception is a full hour longer, and it never pivots. I believe the technical term is \"switcheroo.\" Inception doesn't have any. It just plays out the caper more-or-less according to plan, with some fresh perils thrown in that feel arbitrary. It peels away Cobb's character, but the reveal packs no punch, because something of the sort had been telegraphed ad nauseum and, as I said, we don't care about Cobb anyway. The half-assed suggestion at the end that we might still be in a dream doesn't count, although something of the sort could have worked if Nolan had taken the trouble to work it out. Imagine a movie that starts the third act with a revelation that everything you thought was happening was really in DiCaprio's head, that his subconscious was being invaded by extractors not working for him but who are on some other more interesting mission, that DiCaprio is laboring under an implanted idea, that he and not Cillian Murphy is the target of the caper -- something along those lines. Too obvious? Maybe, unless it's all skillfully befogged and revealed. (Some have suggested that Nolan was actually going for something like this, and that it's so well befogged that I missed it, and that you have to see it twice or thrice in order to decipher the clues, and so forth. I doubt that this is what's going on, but, even if it is, I don't go to the movies for a homework assignment. Seeing it once should be enough to understand what happened.)\nMusic: Inception's score goes like this: \"Booooom. Booooom. Booooom. Booooom.\" Salt's, of the Bourne school, goes like this: \"Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta-Ta-ta.\" This is a nice illustration of the difference between the two movies. Slow and bellowing vs. quick and light.\nSex: Here, Salt doesn't score so well. The elimination of sex from the genre, in favor of a fanboy's vision of what's sexy, is a whole other topic under the heading The Decline and Fall of the Hollywood Thriller. I suppose that Jolie's sex appeal was enough to check off this box, though barely. But Inception has zero sex appeal. *That's* certainly not Hitchcockian! Cotillard is mostly a demon presence or off her nut. There's not a hint of a real relationship there. Page's sex doesn't register in her anticeptic role. On the whole, Inception is ironically barren and lifeless."}
{"text":"In the brutal World War 2 Battle of Saipan, Sergeant Joe Enders (Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage) guards - and ultimately befriends - Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), a young Navajo trained in the one wartime code never broken by the enemy, the Navajo Code. But if Yahzee should fall into Japanese hands, how far will Enders go to save the military's most powerful secret? John Woo directs this \"exciting\" (Premiere) \"against-all-odds battle adventure\" (The Toronto Star) written by John Rice and Joe Batteer and inspired by the true story of the Navajo soldiers whose courage and sacrifices helped win the war in the Pacific.\n\nSynopsis\n\nOn December 8, 1941, the United States declared war on Japan. For the next several years, U.S. forces were fully engaged in battle throughout the Pacific, taking over islands one by one in a slow progression towards mainland Japan.During this brutal campaign, the Japanese were able to break coded military, dramatically slowing U.S. progress.\nIn 1942, several hundred Navajo Americans were recruited as Marines and trained to use their language as code. Marine Joe Enders is assigned to protect Ben Yahzee - a Navajo code talker, the Marines' new secret weapon. Enders' orders are to protect his code talker, but if Yahzee should fall into enemy hands, he's to \"protect the code at all costs.\" Against the backdrop of the horrific Battle of Saipan, when capture is imminent, Enders is forced to make a decision: if he can't protect his fellow Marine, can he bring himself to kill him to protect the code? The Navajo code was the only one never broken by the Japanese, and is considered to have been key in winning the war.\n\nEveryone who knows of this movie I think also knows it's very simple premise, based on a true story - a code based on the native american indian language, thus impenetrable by the enemy as long as they did not have access to a speaker of the language who understood the code.\n\nNicholas Cage is Joe Enders, a marine assigned the task of \"protecting the code\", a task that essentially involves being body guard to a Navajo radio operator, but with a terrible responsibility to ensure that that operator does not fall into enemy hands alive, if the situation should arise.\n\nOn paper, this film should rock - John Woo directing, Nicholas Cage and Christian Slater out front, and an easily comprehended premise providing the basis for a strong emotional drama played out against the backdrop of World War II.\n\nIn practise, unfortunately, things don't quite seem to gel. The biggest problem is that John Woo just isn't able to shake off that certain \"other worldly\" feel that seems to permeate his Hollywood movies. This works in his favour when the premise is itself fantastical (Face\/Off), or at least hyper-real (Broken Arrow), but Windtalkers demands a more grounded sensibility. The battle scenes in this movie are undeniably well staged, but it is also impossible not to see them as precisely that - staged.\n\nA theme of racism running through the story provides the framework for some of the strongest performances in the movie, but ultimately is underplayed and thrown away, to the point that it could easily have been lost in the editing room without anyone noticing.\n\nSimilarly a story device involving letters from a wannabe girlfriend falls flat and is quickly forgotten when the uncomfortably inevitable ending makes resolving that particular element of the story inconveniently awkward.\n\nAll of which is a crushing shame, as there is undeniably a story worth telling in the truth of the events that inspired this movie, and for that alone I would say the film is worth seeing. Just don't expect Private Ryan or Letters from Iwo Jima levels of gritty reality.\n\nYou can earn a 5% commission by selling Windtalkers"}
{"text":"Gupta's film is set in an alternative Britain in 1945, imagined as being under Nazi occupation. 26 year-old Sarah Lewis, a farmer's wife, wakes up one morning in her home in a small Welsh valley to find her husband has left in the night without even saying goodbye. Later that morning she finds that all the men in the valley have disappeared. The women believe that the men have left to join the Resistance and that they will be back soon.\n\nBefore they can find out exactly where their husbands and sons have gone, a German patrol arrives in the valley and the women don't know why they are there. The women of this tiny community work together on their farms, helping each other as the winter approaches. They anxiously await news of their men folk but can find out nothing. The winter becomes so severe that the women reluctantly accept the German soldiers' help. Sarah becomes very friendly with the patrol's commanding officer, Albrecht. But tragedy looms, when the women are suspected of being collaborators.\n\nAndrea Riseborough brings a glowing intensity to her role as Sarah, while Tom Wlaschia gives a strong portrayal of the Nazi officer, Albrecht who is torn between his duty as a German officer and doing what he believes is right. Michael Sheen has a tiny part as a resistance leader.\n\nThe film is somewhat long drawn out and lacks any sense of urgency. What is impressive, however, in what is director Gupta's first film, is the depiction of the Welsh landscape. The sounds and visuals of the valley in different seasons are very well caught.While it will not appeal to those expecting an exciting war film, this is a sensitive, mood piece. Based on the book, Resistance by Owen Sheers, this is a story that could have happened."}
{"text":"What It's About:\n\nThis antic, sprawling drama set in contemporary France follows the parallel fates of Parisian art dealer Nora (Devos), who's just learned that her father, an author caring for her young son Elias (Valentin Lelong), has terminal cancer, and her ex-husband Isma\u00ebl (Amalric), a neurotic classical musician plotting to escape from a mental hospital after a nervous breakdown.\n\nWhy I Love It:\n\nThis highly eccentric, character-driven melodrama by France's most intelligent young director is built upon the marvelous performances of Devos and Amalric, the finest and most versatile actors of their generation. Nora is a woman who seeks to maintain her composure through the worst kinds of crises-the death of her lover, a father's betrayal-while Isma\u00ebl is narcissistic, inappropriate, and bursting with strong emotions he can barely fathom. So his unexpectedly moving speech at the finale, in a scene with Lelong, is truly a highlight in a film blessed with many. Watch for Catherine Deneuve in a brief, humorous turn as Isma\u00ebl's unflappable psychiatrist. Funny, tragic, and exhilarating all at once, this is a \"Queen\" you'll surely kneel for."}

{"text":"WHAT I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE MOVIE:\nIt's a Western, starring Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman, and directed by Clint Eastwood.\n\nLET ME EXPLAIN...\nI have to admit, there was a fair amount of anticipation for me to see this movie. This was the first Clint Eastwood Western I had ever seen, and everyone I know who had already seen it always say things like \"SUCH a great movie\" at just the mention of its name.\n\nHowever, when my wife and I saw another Western, \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (rated #73 on AFI's list), we didn't like it. Or more appropriately, we didn't get it. We'd heard from so many people how great that film was, but we thought it was slow and we never really got into the plot. (If anybody can explain to me why that movie is so good, please leave a comment on here and tell me.) So with this being really only the 2nd Western I had ever seen after \"Butch Cassidy\", I was nervous I wouldn't like this one, either.\n\nFortunately, I did like this movie. Actually, I liked the movie right up until the ending. Then I loved it.\n\nI really don't know how to discuss what I thought about \"Unforgiven\" without giving away anything to those who haven't already watched it. My wife and I spent a good half hour after it ended talking about what we both thought, and the crux for every topic - all the character development, every crucial scene or piece of dialogue, etc. - is dependent on seeing this movie in its entirety. It's like watching a mystery whodunnit: most of it might not make much sense or seem that great until you find out who the murderer is. Then, after the big revelation, you end up thinking the whole movie is great (at least, I do). \"Unforgiven\" isn't a mystery whodunnit, but it has that same dependency on the ending to make every other scene better. And it delivered. Trust me on that!\n\nWhy is this a \"Top 100\" Movie?\nWhile being an admitted \"Western novice\", I felt watching \"Unforgiven\" educated me on what a good Western should be. Of course, not having a lot of viewing experience to compare it to in that genre, I can only say that I at least know that this particular Western is awesome. This movie also speaks volumes into the complexities of life and morals in the Old West, particularly regarding the act of killing a person (which most Old West examples I've seen portray killing as practically just another job, but this film rightly conveys it as a difficult and horrible act to commit). So I'm inclined to say it's a Top 100 movie because it's an epic Western, but in my opinion, it's just an awesome movie. It also won multiple awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (Gene Hackman) in 1992.\n\nNot really a complaint, but...\nThrough most of \"Unforgiven\", Clint Eastwood's acting seemed to be wooden and emotionless. But - once again - the ending changed all that for me. I ended up seeing his character as someone fighting emotion and his natural tendencies which - to me - explained his \"wooden\" demeanor. Plus, Clint Eastwood at the end was entirely believable, so this is just another example of how the ending made the entire movie - including Eastwood's acting - better.\n\nLET ME SUM UP...\nI would not call myself a fan of Western films by any means, but this movie was awesome. It's a fantastic example of how an ending can kick the rest of a movie up a notch just by being so good (Vertigo is another classic example of this). When the movie ended, I almost wanted to start watching it all over again to see just how much better I'd like the rest of it after knowing how it ends.\n\nWHAT I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE MOVIE:\nOnly 2 things:\n1) It starred Charlie Sheen\n2) It's about the Vietnam War\n\nLET ME EXPLAIN...\nThis is the third \"Vietnam\" movie I have seen. The first one being \"We Were Soldiers\" (decent, but it felt more like a Mel Gibson movie than a Vietnam War movie), and \"Apocalypse Now\", which I would categorize not so much as a Vietnam movie (though it does convey the horrors of it very well), but more of a horror story set in the Vietnam War (if that makes sense). \"Platoon\", in my opinion, has been the best example of showing what fighting in the Vietnam War was like.\n\nBeing too young to have lived through Vietnam, I've always been a little confused about why we were there, though I keep getting the feeling most people were confused why we were there while we were there. This film did nothing to make me think otherwise. In fact, if I had to describe \"Platoon\" in two words, it would be TOTAL AMBIGUITY... What are we doing here? Who's really in charge here? Who are the real bad guys? At a confusing time in American history, this movie does an excellent job of illustrating how confusing being in the war must have been.\n\nAnother quick note on the overall story: the tagline for the film is \"The first casualty of war is innocence.\" This is spot on in \"Platoon\", and Charlie Sheen's character is the perfect illustration of that.\n\nWhat makes this a \"Top 100\" Movie?\nWhen I think of what movie probably conveys World War 2 the best, \"Saving Private Ryan\" immediately comes to mind. And now when I think of what movie probably conveys the Vietnam War the best, I'll think of \"Platoon\". It's a very well done film about a significant war in American history. It was also nominated for 8 Academy Awards, winning 4 of them, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nNot really a complaint, but...\nAt first I was disappointed at the lack of back-story for practically every character in the movie. You only get tiny hints of where guys came from and what they did back home, but then I realized that that's something that made the movie better. Why? Well, this movie was very realistic, and it puts the audience in the situation of being a brand new soldier who's thrown into the hell of Vietnam. Just like a new soldier, you don't know the other guys, and you don't know their back-stories. That's more realistic than getting told through flashbacks or heavy monologues why some guys are the way they are. It also added to the ambiguity of the movie because you couldn't truly know what some guys were capable of.\n\nLET ME SUM UP...\n\"Platoon\" was captivating (the 2 hours went by really fast), it was hard to watch, it was sickening, and it was realistic. I was really glad I finally saw it, but I didn't feel like I wanted to ever watch it again. However, it seems like the best illustration on what the Vietnam War was probably like; it was well acted (Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe were both nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and Charlie Sheen did an excellent job in his transformation from \"innocent\" to \"corrupted by war\"); and all that together makes me say this is definitely a film to watch at least once in your life.\n\nWHAT I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE MOVIE:\nOnly one thing: it's of the film noir genre. Film Noir, according to the ever-so dependable Wikipedia, is defined as: \"a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly those that emphasize moral ambiguity and sexual motivation.\"\n\nLET ME EXPLAIN...\nSeeing as how \"Double Indemnity\" is a film noir, I was apprehensive about watching it, especially since I didn't like The Maltese Falcon. However, after watching this film, I've come to the conclusion that it's not film noir I dislike. I'm just not a big fan of \"The Maltese Falcon\". In other words, I really liked \"Double Indemnity\".\n\nWhat did I like about this movie? Well, the use of lighting and shadows was very cool. I thought Barbara Stanwyck's performance was excellent. Edward G. Robinson was also outstanding, and his character - \"Keyes\" - was my favorite. But the story itself was easily the best thing about this movie.\n\nIt had some outstanding suspense (two scenes in particular I remember feeling REALLY nervous that they were going to get caught), and it was very Hitchcock-esque. And to spend the whole movie hoping the characters get away with murder while their plan continues to unravel (not really spoilers, since you know from the very first scene they don't get away with it) made this movie fly by quickly. I was surprised when I looked down at the clock and realized there were only about 5 minutes left.\n\nWhat makes this a \"Top 100\" Movie?\nAfter watching a special on the DVD's \"Bonus Features\", I got a pretty good idea why this movie is considered one of the greatest ever. First of all, \"Double Indemnity\" is considered by many to be the first real American \"film noir\" movie, and seeing how that genre holds a significant niche in film history, it makes sense that the first great example of it is considered one of the best. The story itself was also quite controversial, as it took 8 years before the Hollywood Production Code allowed it to be filmed because it centered around such an immoral plot (and I'm learning that controversy in a well-made film usually helps boost its significance in film history). It also received seven Oscar nominations in 1944. And from my perspective, the story had great suspense and the basic idea has been re-done so many times since that it seems to be quite the groundbreaking plot.\n\nMy complaint (or, in honor of Keyes, \"What the little man inside me says\")...\nThe ending. Maybe I missed the subtleties of it, or I just couldn't appreciate it enough. Up until the last 5 to 10 minutes, I was ready to give this a solid 8\/10, but the ending seemed really flat and anti-climactic, and it made my opinion of the whole movie drop a bit.\n\nLET ME SUM UP...\nThis is a great story of suspense and could almost be mistaken for a Hitchcock film. Even though elements in this movie have been re-used in many suspense-thrillers since 1944, I found it to have some original excitement. Up until the ending, I was extremely entertained and found the first hour and 40 minutes to fly by."}
{"text":"The Village\n\nFor four films straight\u2014The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, and now The Village\u2014writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has conjured a winning formula that weds market-ready hooks and surprise payoffs with a Spielbergian knack for pop craftsmanship. By this point, the results are beginning to whiff of cold calculation, as if viewers exist only to be suckered. But Shyamalan is a master manipulator, so in control of his effects that it's hard not to follow him down his latest rabbit-hole. In the context of his career, The Village may have finally emptied his usual bag of tricks, but considered on its own merits, its skillful fusion of Grimm fairy-tale horror and pointed social parable find Shyamalan in peak form.\n\nIn a close-knit, conservative settlement where the ruling council of elders speaks in harsh tones about the \"wicked\" towns outside its borders, the villagers are forcibly isolated by the surrounding woods, unable to think about the outside world. The elders have formed an uneasy truce with \"those we don't speak of\"\u2014an ominous phrase referring to the murderous creatures that are prepared to slaughter anyone who sets a toe into the forest. After a child dies from lack of medical care, intrepid loner Joaquin Phoenix volunteers to brave the woods in search of modern medicine, but his actions have potentially grave consequences for his fellow citizens. Council head William Hurt tries to dissuade him from leaving, but Hurt's blind daughter (Bryce Dallas Howard) inspires Phoenix with her curiosity and love, much to the chagrin of the psychologically imbalanced Adrien Brody.\n\nWorking with Coen brothers cinematographer Roger Deakins, whose artfully murky compositions recall classic Jacques Tourneur skin-crawlers like I Walked With A Zombie and Night Of The Demon, Shyamalan relies on old-fashioned techniques for suspense and shocks. As in Signs, the creatures gain their menace through precise framing, stomach-churning sound work, and offscreen space; it says something when the film's biggest jolt involves a brief flash of red across the screen. Now, if only Shyamalan were as skilled behind the typewriter as he is behind the camera: The plotting isn't exactly airtight, and his approximation of 19th-century dialogue often sounds like something Yoda would write.\n\nYet The Village succeeds most as a chilling storybook allegory on the pursuit of knowledge and the perils of isolationism. The Big Twist\u2122, when it arrives, isn't some arbitrary bit of rug-pulling, but it enforces ideas that should resonate with American moviegoers weary of their own persistent threats and sealed borders. If Shyamalan can only keep from hemming himself in as a filmmaker, The Village bodes well for his future."}

{"text":"A: To tell the ultimate love story from A to Z. From the first encounter to the last. Break up to reunion. From the best years of two lovers' lives to the worst.\n\nQ: When did you get the idea that you wanted it to be a gender reversal?\n\nA: I thought, \"This is the ultimate challenge for a couple in society: transsexuality.\" It's a movie of how authentic you are willing to be in a relationship. When you meet someone, you become a teen. You have this honeymoon. After this comes the moment where you start being some sort of persona, and you start being the person you are. Is the other willing to accept you that way? Laurence Anyways is about that.\n\nQ: You originally had another actor in mind for the title character. How did Melvil Poupaud get the role?\n\nA: Melvil answered the phone, and two days later he was waxing his chest in Montreal. He responded so quickly to that request and showed up in Montreal and tried all the clothing for hours and hours and hours while he was jet-lagged. We looked at him in the way the clothing was falling on his chest and his legs and the way he was standing. We saw Laurence, in front of us, for the first time. We thought, \"This is our Laurence.\"\n\nHe did that with such commitment and abandoned himself to this with so much faith and trust towards us and the movie that I thought, this is exactly what this character is doing in the story. But he can do it in real life.\n\nQ: Do you expect audiences to bring their sexual-identity baggage with them when watching Laurence Anyways?\n\nA: People can bring their baggage to it. As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather have people bringing their own private baggage to this than their cultural baggage. Imposing references and influences on me is the irksome tic of analysis in movies. But for the rest of the people, the audience, or the people who review films, I'd love for them to bring their baggage and their privacy into the theatre.\n\nQ: What \"tics\" have critics attributed to your films that you haven't liked? Is it the comparisons to filmmakers like Pedro Almod\u00f3var?\n\nA: Well, for example, I have absolutely no exhaustive knowledge of Almod\u00f3var's work. I'm ignorant, literally, of his work. I've seen three of his films: Volver, Broken Embraces and Talk to Her. I think we're both gay and we like colours. Gay men protect women. They invent scenarios and situations where women are heroes, while their mothers have disappointed them. So maybe I think that's something Almod\u00f3var does, he writes very strong female leads. That doesn't make us cosmic twins or something. I know people are being very flattering when they write things like this. I think what I'm really aiming for in this life and this career is to be versatile enough to never have a signature.\n\nQ: So you're not exactly thrilled about the idea of seeing the adjective \"Dolanesque\" any time soon?\n\nA: What will it mean? It depends on the definition. I'm just going to work real hard on trying very different things, and I will always, always always read what people think about my work. It's always very educational and very interesting. I read reviews because I'm interested in what people think and understand and accept to understand to see in my work. Sometimes it's very interesting because I'm thinking, \"Yeah, he's right. There's a little bit too much of that. I'll get better next time.\" That's rare, though"}
{"text":"Mysteries of Lisbon\n\nRaul Ruiz, who passed away this year after directing over 100 films (with nary a mainstream hit), is an interesting case. It's not so much that I've never really heard a satisfying explanation for some of his more enigmatic films; it's that satisfying explanations seem to be completely besides the point. Initially, this led me to think that his films focused so exclusively on formal tinkering that they disregarded drama (I think \"Michael Bay for grad students\" was the line I used at the time). But his style, full of otherworldly images and romantic bursts of music, is also very attuned to human emotions, and when he keeps his foot in something concrete (as he does here), the results are stunning. So what is Mysteries of Lisbon? It's a graceful merry-go-round of characters, a series of anecdotes and vignettes that keep shifting and morphing into one another over the course of an epic four-hour running time. (Edited down from six, when it aired as a miniseries). At it's core, and if it were directed in a more prosaic style, it would essentially be one big expository soap opera. But in Ruiz's hands, and with the enveloping, mesmerizing mood he creates, it becomes something more: a tract on how life is long, complicated, messy, and beautiful, and you can spend your whole life trying to understand it without coming close.

{"text":"Parents say\n\nKids say\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nParents need to know that the titular partner in Darling Companion is a beloved dog who helps a woman (played by Diane Keaton) fill an emotional vacuum. When the dog gets lost in the woods, her family comes together to track it down, leading to a chance for reconnection. There's some swearing (\"s--t,\" \"ass,\" etc.), social drinking, sex talk, and a few suggestive scenes, but this is primarily a simple drama about rekindling love. While the movie's theme and older characters may not hold much appeal for younger viewers, the film's messages offer an important lesson for anyone who's ever been in a long-term relationship.\n\nA self-centered surgeon who at first puts his career before his family comes to realize that he's got his priorities backward and vows to be a better husband and father. That said, some of the characters are fairly stereotypically portrayed.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nBeth (Diane Keaton) adopts a stray dog who becomes her DARLING COMPANION to help her cope with her growing empty-nest issues now that her daughters have grown up and moved out, especially since her husband, Joseph (Kevin Kline) is far more concerned about his career as a surgeon than his family. But when the dog gets lost in the woods after the wedding of one of their daughters, Joseph gets the chance to adjust his priorities with some help from his sister's (Dianne Wiest) new boyfriend (Richard Jenkins), who may be smarter than he looks.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nDarling Companion has a pure message that it delivers in at-times wonderfully simple but other times discouragingly pat story. Yes, it's important that Joseph learns the value of family -- and no, it comes as no surprise that he does. Nor is it a shock that the doctor gets an important lesson in humility as he discovers that sometimes the surgeon needs to be cared for. But most of that's forgivable given the wealth of talent that graces the screen. Kline and Keaton, both consummate professionals, have an authentic (if unsurprising) moment of realization about the state of their marriage that could make even the steeliest of hearts crack. And Wiest and Jenkins steal the show as a couple that appears, at first, to be hapless and troubled but proves to be the best companions of all.\n\nBut unfortunately there are issues that prevent Darling Companion from being, well, darling. Let's start with the quasi-psychic caretaker who helps track down the dog. That she's of Roma descent isn't just annoyingly stereotypical but also superfluous. Her character seems tagged on for added ... what? It's never clear. There's always a place for the mystical, but plotlines that veer toward it should be done well. As it stands, that element in particular makes the film seem more like a TV movie of the week than a feature film with A-list stars stereotypes.

Why do filmmakers fall back on using common character types?\n\nHow does Darling Companion compare to other dramas about aging couples?

{"text":"Movie Review: The Wolfman (2010)\n\nI managed, over the past few months, to get myself pretty excited for The Wolfman. I liked the trailers and the cast and the posters, and I'm generally starved for intense, atmospheric movies. When the bad reviews started pouring in, I figured I'd be the guy who could see its merits, accept its flaws, and give it a positive review. And here I am, able to see those merits shining through, but a good review is more than I can muster.\n\nThe Wolfman is ostensibly a remake of the 1941 Universal Pictures monster movie of (almost) the same title. Aside from the general werewolf premise, the plots of the two movies only share a few key reference points. Joe Johnston's The Wolfman begins with Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returning to his family's estate in Great Britain upon the death of his brother. After reuniting with his father (Anthony Hopkins), Lawrence agrees to investigate his brother's death at the request of his brother's fiancee, Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt). He starts his inquiry at a traveling gypsy caravan, and while he's there, a marauding beast attacks. Lawrence is bitten, and though he survives, he discovers that he has incurred a grim fate.\n\nThe rest of the film follows Lawrence as he transforms, ravages, is condemned, escapes, and faces the demons of a haunting past that contributed to his tragedy. I would describe the plot in more detail, but the synopsis would make it sound more complicated than it actually is. This is to the movie's credit; it builds a fairly in-depth web of relationships between its core characters, and it takes a number of sharp turns and twists before it settles into its predictable final scenes.\n\nThe film succeeds in some other ways, too. Johnston handles the atmosphere well, rendering one of the most inky, intense Gothic worlds I've seen in a while. In this respect, films like Hellboy could take a lesson from The Wolfman, which uses light and shadow to accentuate ornate sets and landscapes, baroque arrangements that also manage to seem stark and ominous. Of all the film's departures from the original, its atmosphere and tone are probably the best creative decision. Furthermore, the actors are well-chosen. Anthony Hopkins channels Hannibal Lecter, providing a uniquely sinister portrait of fatherhood. Del Toro acts well, too, though he doesn't play quite the timid second-son character that his backstory would suggest. The calculated Gothic-noir demeanor of Hugo Weaving fits the milieu, as well.\n\nArticle comments\n\nI haven't seen this one yet, Jesse, but from what I hear from people who have seen it is that it misses the mark. Why remake a classic? Why tinker with that? I don't know, but I will wait to see it myself before I can say more."}
{"text":"Summary:Bobby Green; he greets friends and customers or dances with his beautiful Puerto Rican girlfriend, Amada, in a haze of cigarette smoke and disco music. But it's 1988, and New York City's drug trade is escalating. Bobby tries to keep a friendly distance from the Russian gangster who is operating out of the nightclub--a gangster who is being targeted by his brother, Joseph, an up-and-coming NYPD officer, as well as his father, Burt, the legendary deputy chief of police. (Columbia Pictures)\u2026Expand\n\nThe closest thing Gray's done to a commercial actioner, the film also applies his genius for tone (aided by superlative sound work) to set pieces that throb with trauma: a tinnitus-soundtracked shoot-out and a rain-slick car chase set to the tempo of windshield wipers.\n\nAmada(Eva Mendes) is not a blondie; that's why \"Heart of Glass\" and \"Rapture\" throb on the soundtrack. This irony sets the stage for Amada's new life as a law and order man's girlfriend. But \"We Own the Night\" is dishonest about Bobby's father(Robert Duvall) and brother(Mark Wahlberg) in their dealings with Amada, the \"brown-ie\", the Puerto Rican who sticks out like a sore thumb at police functions. There's racism, but the film conceals it through editing. Since \"We Own the Night\" chooses to be cowardly about dealing with Amada's ethnicity, it's only fair that the writer hammers square peg attributes, such as integrity and a willingness to be law-abiding, down her round-hole essentiality. Amada likes being an outlaw, but \"We Own the Night\" doesn't want to Maria Conchita-Alonso her(she played a bad girl in Dennis Hopper's \"Colors\"), and reforms her party girl image. \"We Own the Night\" could've been an exceptional police procedural had Bobby(Joaquin Phoenix) insisted that the Grusinsky men accept Amada into the fold as one of the preconditions for his coaction in the family business.\u2026Expand\n\nIn We Own The Night, Bobby Green(played by Joaquin Phoenix) the owner of a night club, finds himself, his police captain brother Joseph, his father, a police chief, and his girlfriend in the center of a crime wave due to gangsters and drug dealers who are killing cops at an increasingly high rate. The movie was better than I expected, as I walked in not knowing what the movie was about(I had not seen the trailers or heard much about it prior to watching it). Joaquin Phoenix gave a good performance as the lead, but he didn't wow me as he did in Walk the Line(however, I don't blame him; His character felt underdeveloped to me, as did many others). Mark Wahlberg was just above average as Bobby's tough older brother who doesn't approve of his wild behavior. Eva Mendez plays Bobby's girlfriend and I found her part in the film almost pointless and her performance was just average. The movie drags in parts but for the most part it isn't boring and kept my attention. Although there was not much that really set the movie high above the average crime thriller, it did leave an impact on me at the end. I recommend the movie to those who are looking to pass the time.\u2026Expand\n\nThis movie just didn't cut it. A guy (J. Phoenix) doesn't go from being a nightclub manager inside a drug den to becoming a decorated cop simply because his high-ranking father got killed. Mark Wahlberg gets shot execution style but lives... only in the movies. The plot lines aren't well developed. The viewer never gets to identify with any of the characters because they're all generic stereotypes, and many of the scenes are incredibly boring. I'm glad I watched this on DVD and could use the fast-forward button; an hour-and-45 minute flick took just 45 minutes to watch, and it still lacked entertainment value.\u2026Expand"}
{"text":"Review: The Trip (2010)"}
{"text":"A Series of Unfortunate Events is uniquely bizarre and many may find its sense of the macabre somewhat repellent. However, there's a clue dropped early on about how to take the story. The executor of the Baudelaire will is named Mr. Poe. This is Edgar Allen Poe for children.\n\nClearly this movie's aiming for the success of the Harry Potter series but a closer relative is Jumanji from several years ago. Director Brad Silberling has given this production of Lemony Snicket's (Daniel Handler's) book a feel rather like Tim Burton would have. Or perhaps it's more of a Terry Gilliam feel. Credit Production Designer Rick Heinrichs for this. It's dark and yet familiar; you can't quite identify what year it is or what city you are in. You are surrounded by all kinds of strangely mutated technology, like a 64 Chrysler Imperial with five rearview mirrors and a tiny reel to reel tape deck built into the dash. Lemony Snicket himself (Jude Law in silhouette) is always surrounded by giant clockwork gears and is tapping out the story on an antique typewriter.\n\nThe central figures are Violet and Klaus Baudelaire. Violet can invent anything out of materials at hand and Klaus knows all sorts of useful trivia because he reads so much. They and their baby sister were orphaned by a mysterious fire. Their parents' fortune is to be at the disposal of their new guardian, the gangly and frizzy-haired Count Olaf. Played with a duplicitous and double-jointed zeal by Jim Carrey, Olaf is clearly focused on their demise. The children escape from his clutches and are given over to other eccentric relatives but Olaf keeps trying; the movie meanders through a half dozen of his curious plots against them.\n\nPurists will point out that the story doesn't follow the books' storyline that closely, but as a movie it hangs together well. Jim Carrey alone would make the movie worth watching but it features a lot of acting talent besides him. Not the least of these is Emily Browning and Liam Aiken playing Violet and Klaus Baudelaire. Browning especially, who seems like a pre-teen Angelina Jolie, displays a strength that will ensure her appearance in movies for years to come. Billy Connolly is charmingly reptilian as Uncle Monty and Meryl Streep is surprisingly comic as the monumentally ditzy Aunt Josephine. Dustin Hoffman even shows up momentarily in the audience at Olaf's play.\n\nIt's weirdly perverse and yet charming, but definitely not a happy time elf movie for tiny tots. Yes, it's Poe for children; we were warned.\n\nThe Skinny:\nDid I enjoy the movie? Yes I admit I delighted in the torment of these orphans.\nWould I go to see it again? My daughter says the books are definitely better but I bet she'll watch it again when the DVD comes out."}
{"text":"Let's get the important stuff out of the way first: there are no scenes of Courtney and Lili gobbling each other up. Yeah, that's a disappointment, but so it goes.\n\nThe performances were excellent, and somewhat believable, except for the sudden emergence of an older, uneducated suburban housewife as a scientific prodigy. Yeah, that happens all the time. That was the only plot device that didn't fly, but it really ruins the rest of the movie. You just can't see this woman suddenly discovering she is a genius, a lesbian, and her independence all at the same time.\n\nShe suddenly discovers she's a lesbian? Sure, why not. That one works. But why does it have to involve her tossing her husband out on the street? How is it his fault? Lesbians don't have any feelings for people who have supported and loved them? She suddenly discovers she's in love with her best friend. Yeah, that one works, too. It throws an interesting twist into the film and Courtney Love delivers one of her better performances here.\n\nShe suddenly discovers she's a genius? This is where it breaks down. She never showed the slightest sign of intelligence before, but now she's a prodigy. Unfortunately for her husband, she's not smart enough to treat him with any dignity or respect, but she's smart enough to write cryptographic algorithms even though she never graduated high school. If it wasn't for this lame, unnecessary and ignorant part of the movie, I'd say it was a great independent and lesbian film.\n\nJulie Johnson could have been the average housewife who discovers she's a lesbian and is in love with her best friend. That would have made a good film. But she's suddenly a spiteful genius, and that doesn't make a good film. Too bad.\n\n5 of 11 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?"}
{"text":"Picks and Pans Review: pi\n\nFirst, a refresher course for those of us forever mathematically challenged: Pi, the symbol for which is the title of this disturbing intellectual thriller, is always the number 3.14...carried to infinity.\n\nIt is the notion of infinity, stretching beyond what the mind can grasp, that is the starting point for pi. Shot in black and white on a dinky $60,000 budget, the movie follows a math whiz (Gullette) who's obsessively hunting for a pattern in the seemingly random numbers of the stock market. As he feverishly calculates away, both a Wall Street firm and a breakaway Hasidic sect whose members believe God is in the numbers, try to force Gullette into sharing his research. It's all very intense, and, as pi progresses, ever more dismaying as it becomes clear that what we are witnessing is less a mathematical breakthrough than a mental breakdown. What's most startling and impressive about pi is how first-time filmmaker Darren Aronofsky has found a surrealistic visual vocabulary (an ant in a computer, a hand dripping blood, a pulsating brain) to convey both intellectual overdrive and madness, pi is not for the squeamish.

{"text":"Hay River\n\nUser's review\n\nThis movie musical is visually embracing and as a fantasy is wonderful. Not everyone will \"get\" this movie, but just sit back and let it happen. A little reading about the movie 8 1\/2 and the plot summary before you go will help. It is different with a much smaller story line than Chicago, but the musical numbers and the actors are worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"Maria Bello has starred in some pretty gritty, jarring movies, and Prime Suspect may cement her status as a star. But before she tore into Helen Mirren's former role as Jane, Bello filmed a small screen movie about an embattled mother who finds herself carjacked by a fugitive bank robber and searches desperately for a way to free her young son from his clutches.\n\nCarjacked is almost as straightforward as its title. It's surprising, given the generally non-mainstream material that Bello has signed up for (Beautiful Boy, The Company Men) that she would take this one on. She did collaborate with Stephen Dorff in World Trade Center so maybe that's where the idea for Carjacked was hatched, with The Marine'sJohn Bonito directing. It's nearly as direct as that film, with flashes of violence, terror, and action that may not be original but will periodically take your breath away.\n\nDorff plays a wicked Roy who stumbles on Loraine (Bello) as she navigates single parenthood with her son and the support group for abused women she attends. It's amazing how horrible the advice is that she gets from her friends, like Job's friends in fact, and it's amazing how incredibly naive and stupid the people she meets are in their interactions with her as she tries to escape Roy, from the people in the gas station to the police officer who pulls them over and everyone in between.\n\nWe could probably predict how this is going to end: you figure Loraine isn't going to take it anymore (at some point) and she'll release the inner Kathy Bates inside of her. She's held down by poor decisions, problems, other people's evil intent, and so much more, but at some point, she has to take initiative to save herself. Surprisingly, it's not to save herself that she finds the greatest resolve, but in the end, sometimes to save yourself, you have to save someone else first."}
{"text":"Proverbial wisdom be damned: absence\ndoesn't make the heart grow fonder-it makes the heart\ncrawl beneath the sheets and sob and throb ceaselessly,\nsleeplessly, for days that feel like weeks, growing\nnot fond, nothing so feathery as fond, but more and\nmore sore. Sore from the hurt, from anger, from being\nleft or having to leave, sore from all of that uninterrupted\nfeeling.\n\nTsai Ming-liang works too subtly and too organically\nto lay it out for us, but with What Time Is It There?\nhe explores every worthy connotation of the word departure,\nfrom taking a trip away to taking the final, mortal\nbow; from making a substantive personal change to simply\nsaying goodbye. Even better, he shows how it all amounts\nto the same, sore thing.\n\nThe familiar, deceptively light question posed by the\nfilm's title is actually a suitable, vernacular expression\nof no less than the state of being. Time, rather than\na fixed fact, is a collusional construct, a structure-while\neminently useful and essential-that's descriptive, not\nprescriptive. Tsai yanks time back to its original metaphorical\nplane, where it ticks and tocks, the tin man's new heart\nfilling the empty space, making sense, the best it can,\nof what's behind, before, and beyond us. Too slow, too\ndismayed to operate in the swift seconds of the literal\nhere and now, we're yet capable, as that question implies,\nof imagining (or at least wondering) what it's like\nover there, of setting our hearts to another time, of\nbeing in both places-if sloppily-at once. It gives our\nlives spatial dimension and, for the privilege, gives\nus heartbreak.\n\nThe first scene, an otherwise banal documentation\nof an old man (Miao Tien) sitting and moving quietly through\nan empty apartment, establishes the film's vocabulary\n(long, deep focused stationary shots), sets the tone (quiet,\nattentive, humanely whimsical), and immediately involves\nthe viewer in its exploration of absence (at the outset\nof the second scene it's implied that the old man has\ndied, and those first, banal moments are all we'll have\nto call on while his wife and son spend the better part\nof the film grieving his loss).\n\nAs with our short glimpse of the old man, interactions\nthroughout What Time Is It There? are fleeting;\nover time, in the company of only oneself, moments of\ncontact swell with meaning, memories carrying into the\nfuture a deepened feeling for what's past. Rather than\nreceding, the hunger to recall what's passed imbues meaning\nin everything, animating the inanimate, impregnating empty\nspace, and bending time. Tsai shows people literalizing\ntheir loss by fixating on objects: the widow (Lu Yi-ching)\ntries to bring back her husband's spirit by casting spells\non household items, cooking his favorite meals, and adjusting\nto \"his time\" by covering the windows and eating and sleeping\nat strange hours. Though it's never shown, \"his time\"-as\nestablished by the off-time kitchen clock-was likely set\nby the son, Hsiao-kang (Lee Kang-sheng), a watch salesman\nwho we'd earlier seen changing the clocks in his bedroom\nto \"Paris time\" in honor of a Paris-bound girl, Shiang-chyi\n(Chen Shiang-chyi), to whom he sold his own dual-time\nwatch. But the son never corrects his mother, and nor\ndoes Tsai define which clock time is Paris and which is\nTaipei: they're each in their own time, sharing a space\nbut in different orbits, real time subordinate to the\ndesire to span all that empty space and get back in step,\nin time, with the departed.\n\nTolerant at first, Hsiao-kang\ngrows weary of his mother's erratic and desperate behavior,\nand he tries to make her stop. But he can't, nor can\nhe offer any comfort save for staying out of the way.\nConvinced that the deceased will return, she forbids\nthe killing of any living thing for 49 days. When a\ncockroach is apprehended in the kitchen, the son drops\nit into the fish tank, where it is immediately, comically\ndevoured. Before long, mother surmises that her husband's\ntraveling soul is in fact swimming around in the belly\nof their large white carp. Face to face with the fish,\nwater rimming her eyes, it's a devastatingly funny moment.\nIrrational and pathetic in her grief, she proceeds to\nspeak with shattering honesty. \"Have you come back to\nsee me?\" she asks, expressing abandonment's deepest\ndesire. If only, as if it would make it better, or easier,\nor less lonely-if only the departed could see us in\nour grief. To him, to the fish, to us, to herself, she\nconfides, \"It's just so hard.\"\n\nHsiao-kang acts just as erratically, transferring his\ngrief to an obsession with Shiang-chyi in Paris. Though\ndismissive of his mother's reliance on magical spells\nto reach the dead, his obsession with the girl has something-though\nnot everything-to do with the dictum that it's bad luck\nto take an object, such as the watch, from a person\nin mourning (he relays this to Shang-chyi before finally\nrelenting and selling her the watch. To allay his fears,\nshe claims no belief in luck: \"I'm a Christian\"). By\nkeeping time with her, and trying to align Taipei's\ntime-through increasingly risqu\u00e9 public clock manipulations-with\nParis's, he's moved by the desire both to be with her\nand to protect her. It's not much, but with father gone\nforever and mother out to lunch, his traveling sympathies\nare keeping him, and his grief, company.\n\nShiang-chyi, in turn,\nlives the perpetually temporary existence of a foreign\ntraveler, always alone, always on the move, always in\nher own head. She's got that dual-time watch, keeping\nher in both places at once and never fully anywhere.\nA bold gaze from a stranger is at first returned and\nthen rebuffed. Meals are at once commonplace and uncommonly\nthick with anxiety. She asks for help, and then, when\nit's given, she grows weary of the generosity. To travel\nalone is to prefer, on some level, one's own company;\non another level, travel widens the search for connection;\non all levels, one grows terribly lonely and desperate\nfor the company of another. Tsai's observations here\nare pitch-perfect, detailed and emotionally specific,\nand yet iconic. Isolation of this sort, of the silent\ntraveler in a city where one doesn't speak the language,\nhas a certain sound, and What Time Is It There?\nhas it down. By going without a score for the duration\nof the picture, Tsai calls attention to the ambient\nnoise of various spaces, and to the tentative, spooky\nand spooked noises bodies make when alone with themselves.\nIn the city spaces that the girl passes through, silences\nare cavernous and sounds, like the banging in an upstairs\nhotel room or the clip of heels on an empty street,\nare amplified and threatening.\n\nWhile mother's grief crescendos with a fancy (and ultimately\nmasturbatory) date at home with her beloved's photograph,\nthe two young principals move against their tide of\nisolation and try to connect with other human beings:\nHsiao-kang, in his car, with a prostitute, and Shiang-chyi\nin the bed of a fellow female Chinese expat. Fresh from\nletting their mutual connection pass too quickly, they\neach hold on too long and too strong, looking for company\nwhere only momentary comfort was on offer. Burned, Tsai\nliteralizes their worsening state of affairs by leaving\nthem robbed-boy of his wares, and girl of her belongings.\nThey sleep heavily, and no doubt will be more sore in\nthe morning.\n\nThen, after staring filmlong into the faces of absence,\nthere's presence. As the girl sleeps a lonely sleep\nin the grey dawn by the Tuileries, a familiar face appears\nand retrieves her errant suitcase from the reflection\npool. Paris time is \"his time\" after all. It's a gift\nfrom the filmmaker, a generous, godly gift of grace.\nThere's no rest for the weary in the real world-nor\neven for the three achingly lonely principal characters\nin What Time Is It There?-but before releasing\nthe privileged viewers from his world, his lovely,\nlovingly human spell, Tsai Ming-liang reaches across\ntime zones, across language barriers, and likely well\ninto the future, to provide comfort."}
{"text":"The film is called Young Adult. It stars the Oscar winning Charlize Theron, and was directed by JasonReitman and written by Diablo Cody. These two were paired up as Director and Writer in the 2007 film - Juno.\n\nCharl Park West in New York. Instead, Mavis lives in a modest Minneapolis apartment with 'Modest' being an overstatement. However to Mavis, this was a far better situation than if she was stuck back in the old hometown\n\nThe thing about Mavis is that she can't see beyond her own image. Beauty worked for her in high school. She was the prom queen, she dated the school's football hero, and in her mind - the sea was required to part if she showed up on its shore.\n\nSo Mavis was the kind of woman who steamrolled through life - she either overwhelmed you because she was just sooo important, or she never saw you, like you weren't important, or attractive enough to even be noticed, considered, or thought about. What a gal.\n\nSo Charlize takes this role of this kind of a self-centered woman. She thought she was a woman born to run, as in run through life always having everything her way. Only for the rest of us - she was a woman that was born to hated.\n\nSo there's your set up. Usually in this kind of a situation - the bitch goddess gets taken down a peg, gets humiliated, or is knocked off her pedestal by the local folks, who put aside their sense of being threatened, and rev up their inner nobility - and a lesson is learned, the b\/g gets the message, and everyone lives happily ever after.\n\nThat's usually the case - but it doesn't work out that way this time. Mavis is never going to get the message. She'll remain an unrepetentily savage. Not so much that she becomes a cartoon queen of cruelty. No Charlize, Reitman, and Cody have imbued her with a myopic sense of self. She can't see beyond her own aura - the one she imagines, and the one that is like an invisible force field. This field keeps people away, and keeps 'goodness', if any exists within Mavis, locked up inside her.\n\nThe object of Mavis's lust is Buddy Slade played by Patrick Wilson. He's a nice guy, and he loves his wife. But he is somewhat vulnerable when Mavis begins her assault on the beachhead of his marriage. But he quickly marshals his common sense, so he rebuffs, refuses, and reacts in the negative. Watch for his expressions as he gradually gets the message that the message he's sending to Mavis is the message that she's not getting at all.\n\nPatton Oswalt is on hand as the local good guy. He was damaged a long time ago - in fact he was beaten up by town toughs back when he was in high school because they thought he was gay. He wasn't - but he's been badly disabled from that attack. He had the locker next to Mavis back in high school. Does she remember him - not at first - but then she recalls that incident and remembers him as The Hate-Crime Guy.\n\nSo Mavis is on one end of the spectrum - she's the Prom Queen both then and to this day - she's still the prom queen. She got all the attention she could handle. Patton's Matt is on the other end of the spectrum - 180 degrees opposite. He was the geek, the nerd, and he was never noticed.\n\nBuddy is the middle.\n\nThe film has entertainment value despite the fact that the lead is despicable. Kudos to Charlize for taking this role. The film's tagline says - Everyone gets old. Not everyone grows up. So much so, that you are actively rooting against Mavis. Tough work for an actress. But the way Charlize handles this role - she's definitely worth seeing again. that back she goes to a local bar and bumps into an old classmate named Matt who recognizes her. She doesn't recognize him though, even though his locker was next to her through all 4 years of high school. That's because he wasn't part of the popular crowd. In fact, he suffered a brutal beating which caused him to walk with a cane. That's the only thing she does wind up remembering about him. Matt and Mavis form an unlikely bond, though Matt continually warns her not to mess with a married man's happiness. She doesn't care though. She only cares about making herself happy. The best scenes in the movie involve these two since you can tell that Matt still wishes to be with someone like Mavis, and this is the closest he's ever been to that. As uninterested as her ex-boyfriend Buddy seems in her, she still pursues him nonetheless. Matt is just her new friend to confide in, and basically mope around with as she's clearly depressed with her life. One would think Matt should be the depressed one considering he still walks with a cane and hasn't had much luck with the ladies. But he's clearly more content with his life than Mavis is. Matt is played by comedian Patton Oswalt who does a great job in what's more of a serious role. He's sort of the heart of the movie. Mavis remains unchanged. Most movies that center on her type of character would have her do some kind of self-evaluation and become a better person. Mavis starts to realize she's a bit crazy, but she doesn't try to change. That's one unique thing about the movie. It's not the most redeeming film but it's an interesting one. It basically just shows you that some people never grow up.\n\n The film is called Young Adult .

{"text":"VANISHING ON 7TH STREET, the latest from the talented if inconsistent Brad Anderson (beginning its theatrical release today from Magnolia Pictures' Magnet Releasing), will in many reviews and discussions be compared to THE TWILIGHT ZONE. Its small cast, confined to one location during an unexplained widespread apocalypse of shadows and disappearances, does immediately recall the classic series, but sadly, beyond its premise, the parallel isn't sustained.\n\nThe opening reel sees almost the entire population of a major city quite literally disappear, with only their clothes left piled on the ground as remnants. It seems their physical selves have been pulled in to join the masses of dark, shadowy figures that creep and slither along the walls and streets, often echoing what was left of nuclear warfare victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Four survivors\u2014a reporter (Hayden Christensen), a distraught mother (Thandie Newton), a projectionist with interests in dark matter and metaphysics (John Leguizamo) and a young boy left alone (Jacob Latimore)\u2014find each other in a pub on the titular 7th Street, where they argue, muse over the reasons for their plight and make attempts to escape.\n\nWith location work in Detroit and a tale that calls for endless shadow and hard pools of light, Anderson still finds it difficult to create a palpable, threatening atmosphere here. Sure, the premise is intriguing, but the film can only float along so far on the question of what's really going on before the lack of empathy and suspense lead to audience disinterest. To be fair, only some of the VANISHING's faults lie in the director's hands; Anthony Jaswinski's script simply doesn't go anywhere. The action never moves beyond philosophizing over the cause or trying to get the hell out of the bar\u2014but since none of the endless theories hold any more water than the rest, the stakes are never raised. There is strength that lies in haunting ambiguity, but when its development is so muddled, there's nothing stimulating or particularly memorable to ponder post-viewing. One gets a sense that Jaswinski himself didn't have much in the way of an answer, and simply tried to coast on his initially striking premise.\n\nNewton and Leguizamo are regularly solid screen presences, but their chops are undercut by grating characters that force the two actors into wide-eyed and eye-rolling dramatics. Christensen, as usual, is wooden and uninteresting, continuing to dumbfound the world as to why anyone thinks he's a leading man. Young co-stars Latimore and Taylor Groothuis (playing a mysterious little girl who pops up intermittently throughout) fare just fine, though.\n\nWhat's not the film's fault, but won't help either way, is that its final shot is almost an exact clone of an image most genre fans were inundated with in 2010 thanks to another apocalyptic saga. It's an unfortunate coincidence, and when coupled with VANISHING's shoddy and not-so-eerie CGI shadow people, just elicits sympathy for Anderson being saddled with such second-rate material. In its final act, VANISHING ON 7TH STREET shoots for one last gasp of significance when some shadows desperately whisper, \"I exist.\" But the existential angle is just another underdeveloped possibility thrown on the pile. It reminds us that THE TWILIGHT ZONE, even when being vague, taught us something about our lives\u2014lessons that carried a sincere layer of thoughtfulness, not just the shadow of one."}

{"text":"In most cultures, relationships ending sourly is one of life's inevitable truths alongside death and taxes. How does one go about coping with the fact that his girlfriend left him?\n\nWong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express (\u91cd\u5e86\u68ee\u6797, Chung Hing Sam Lam) tries to answer that by following two Hong Kong policemen, No. 223 (Japanese\/Taiwanese singer Kaneshiro Takeshi) and No. 633 (Tony Leung). Both are policemen, and both are dealing with the wake of their love lives having recently gone awry.\n\nChungking Express was one of the sleeper hits of 1994. Little did Wong Kar-Wai know that it would be one of the films he is best remembered for. I picked this one up after having seen Wong's later (and absolutely amazing) In the Mood for Love.\n\nWhat is interesting about Chungking Express is how it actually tells two subordinate stories in sequence rather than one main one. First we see plainclothes officer 223 in hot pursuit of criminals on the streets. We learn of how his relationship with a woman named May ended on April 1. He then falls in love with a woman in a blond wig (Fantasy Mission Force veteran Brigitte Lin). Little does he know that she is in reality a drug smuggler who is on the run when a deal went bad.\n\nQuite a bit sooner than the halfway point, 223\u2032s story ends and transitions to that of the uniformed beat cop 633. 633 had recently broken up with his flight stewardess girlfriend. When stopping at the fast food shop he frequents, he encounters the newly-hired waitress Faye (Faye Wong, the same one who sang \"Eyes On Me\" in Final Fantasy VIII).\n\nThe two acts of Chungking Express are interesting in how similar and different they are. We see 223 take part in exciting foot chases, tackling suspects and holding them at gunpoint. We see the woman in the blond wig running away from would-be assassins in a subway station. On the other hand, 633\u2032s job seemed to more or less entail writing tickets for people who littered, and Faye works what seems like an equally dull job as a waitress.\n\nYet we see that 223 and 633 share similar personalities, strong enough to hope for love, weak enough to be hurt when they don't get it. 223 decides to down thirty cans of pineapples they day they expire on May 1. 633 consoles inanimate objects in his apartment (like a cake of soap) as if they are the ones who are feeling the hurt from the stewardess' leaving his life. Much like the lead cast of Waterboys, our two heroes are easy to relate to in how seemingly pathetic they are.\n\nAs he later did in In the Mood for Love, Wong didn't bother constraining his characters to a plot, and instead let his movie be a pure character study. The four leading characters, from the cautious woman in the blond wig to the absolutely carefree Faye, narrate their parts of their stories, giving us their philosophies as we simply take in events as they unfold through the eyes Wong gives us to see.\n\nDespite the first bit of the movie playing like a crime thriller and the rest as a romantic dramedy, the movie worked overall as a whole. Once again, instead of the music suiting the scene, it looks more like the characters move to the music. We see No. 223 chasing down a thug alongside more frantic, action movie music. We see Faye dancing to The Mamas' and The Papas' \"California Dreamin'\", a quintessentially 60s rock song.\n\nMuch like In the Mood for Love, Chungking Express is a beautiful movie because of its shear simplicity. Wong dared to be different in his telling two separate stories in sequence which led to a generally unconventional story; unfortunately for that reason, while having done very well in Hong Kong, Chungking Express bombed at American box offices. Still, Chungking Express is quintessentially 90s, quintessentially Asian, and overall just a very attractive film."}
{"text":"The film is one that is quick to present us with a number of mysteries. Is the man Harris? Is someone else Harris? Why would someone else pretend to be Harris? If the man isn't Harris, then who is he? Are the bad guys just as confused or do they have the answers?\n\nYou're supposed to care deeply about these questions, because the film wants you to see it just to get the answers. It doesn't promise to be funny or beautiful, it just promises mystery. It doesn't even claim to be an entertaining mystery, just a mystery.\n\nBecause you won't go into the movie caring about Martin Harris or anyone else, all the suspense surrounds the idea of an answer instead of the answer itself. Will the answer be simple or complex? Will they reveal the answer at around the hundred-minute mark or will they wait until the last second? Will the answer be open to interpretation? Will any part of the story turn out to be just a dream?\n\nThe story begins as Harris (I'll refer to the Neeson character as \"Our Harris\" from now on) and his wife Elizabeth (January Jones) travel to Berlin for a biotechnology conference. She goes to check into their hotel, but he realizes that he forgot his briefcase at the airport. He jumps into a cab driven by a girl named Gina (Diane Kruger) to go retrieve it. But the car crashes off a bridge and Harris wakes up in the hospital four days later with severe head trauma.\n\nThe doctor warns him that he might have some false memories as a result of the accident. Harris just wants to get back to his life He returns to the hotel only to discover that his wife is with another man. The man is a biochemist named Dr. Martin Harris (Aiden Quinn). Neither of them claims to know Our Harris.\n\nOur Harris is at first terrified that someone has stolen his identity, but then remembers what the doctor said about false memories. Now he doesn't know what to think. On top of that, there are people trying to kill him. Perhaps Gina the pretty cab driver knows something\u2026\n\nThe bad guys make lousy villains if they can't kill Our Harris Not only is Our Harris mentally disoriented as a result of the crash, he's physically disabled. He should be a sitting duck. But their idea of an attack on Our Harris is to try and catch him when he's a few feet from the door to a train that's about to leave its station. These people quickly eliminate sympathetic witnesses (so we know that they are indeed bad guys) and then take their time with Our Harris so he can escape at the last minute. They have a higher motive than killing Our Harris, and they're laughably bad at executing that plan too.\n\n\"Unknown\" is little more than a two-hour wait for answers to its own questions. Most of the film is useless, its dialogue and action are generic. Its plot is full of twists, which ironically are completely expected in such a mystery. As for the ultimate answer, I guess it technically fits with the plot, although it does mean that some of the film's characters have been lacking in common sense.\n\nThen again, no one is about to accuse the film's characters of possessing common sense (Our Harris suffered head trauma, what's everyone else's excuse?). \"Unknown\" is not a movie where you leave feeling cheated, but you do leave knowing that you could have spent your time and money on something better.\n\nTwo stars out of five.\n\n\"Unknown\" is rated PG-13 for some intense sequences of violence and action, and brief sexual content. Its runtime is 113 minutes."}

{"text":"\"Take This Waltz\" Is A Likeable Summer Indie shows like \"Eastbound and Down.\" Sarah Polley's \"Take This Waltz\" marks a much more serious role for Rogen, albeit not leading, but is just more proof that he possesses versatility in his acting ability.\n\nThis project seems personal to Polley; it's her second feature film, and she features a protagonist in Margot who is flawed to the exact extent so that you, the viewer, actually consider her a human. Not to a point where you want to put a gun to her head and blow her brains because she's a lost cause or, on the opposite side of the spectrum, where you feel bad for her and sympathize with her because she's just plain pathetic \u2013 you accept her for who she is because she just lives how she feels; there is nothing superficial about her whatsoever.\n\nMargot (Michelle Williams) is caught romantically between her husband Lou (Rogen) and her new shy neighbor Daniel (Luke Kirby). In a picturesque Toronto setting completely absent of any sign of winter is where Polley presents this harrowingly realistic storyline, the gorgeous cinematography of this colorfully vibrant atmosphere really adds to the irony of how dark \"Take This Waltz\" is. Margot is just caught in boredom.\n\nEven with all the questionable acts she commits, there still lie the more joyous moments in her life, along with those many unmemorable instances that stand in between. Some days include mindless neon-infused bumper car rides; others include showering with her best friend Geraldine (Sarah Silverman) amongst other women of all shapes and sizes talking about life; most include life's difficulties as we as human beings know them.\n\nThat's why I tend to think women are better at directing women than men are (I'm pointing at you, Woody Allen), because men don't understand that sexual attraction is an enigma \u2013 it's completely random; it's a mystery. Lou cares, caresses, and shows affection for Margot but she simply cannot force herself to do something she doesn't want to do. She's just a human being.\n\n\"Take This Waltz\" plays a lot like Derek Cianfrance's \"Blue Valentine\" in terms of how each film looks at the many inconsistencies that may go alongside the tragedy of being a male in love. Lou is a lot like Ryan Gosling's Dean character; they're both down to earth, generally kind human beings who just can't please Michelle Williams' respective characters. No matter what they do, she still has this unexplainable yet understandable inclination to treat these poor men like shit even though they would do anything for her.\n\nPolley proves she understands both men and women with \"Take This Waltz.\" It's not an awards contender or a best movie of the year contender by any means, but anything this down to earth and realistic is surely commendable."}
{"text":"Secrets and Lies: 'Adoration' - A Review\n\nAs thoughtful, calculated, somber and cold as a heavily footnoted term paper, \"Adoration\" is the first film by Canadian writer-director Atom Egoyan to get a Memphis theatrical booking since the heartbreaking \"The Sweet Hereafter\" in 1998.\n\nLike that earlier movie, \"Adoration\" could be described as an investigation of a tragedy, but in this case the disaster that inspires the drama is a mix of reality and fantasy, as a high school student (Devon Bostick) is encouraged by his sexy-eyebrowed Lebanese theater teacher (Egoyan's wife, the striking Arsinee Khanjian) to concoct a fact-based terrorism fable that circles back to bite its makers when it's accepted as true and goes viral via the Internet.\n\nIn his clumsy, incipient way, the student is a born storyteller, which is to say an artist. \"Why would you make people feel all those things if it wasn't even true?\" an angry adult asks the boy, and it's a question Egoyan seems to be directing at himself. Why does an artist create fantasy situations and characters to inspire feelings of sorrow, terror and joy? Is a fictional tale less worthy of our full emotional investment than a real-life report of horror? If it's not, is art dangerous?\n\nThe movie suggests many other Big Questions about religion, memory, family, purpose. A mysterious woman in a burka haunts the film, and the script contains evocative references to Bethlehem and 9\/11. \"If every life was precious, the world would not be able to sustain itself,\" asserts one character.\n\nThe performances of the actors are impeccable, but their faces provide this rather dull and unconvincing story with its only visual interest. The movie feels like an adaptation of an intriguing but pretentious novel that should have been left on the page."}

This review originally ran in the Jan. 20, 2012, edition of The Oklahoman.\n\nA love letter to silent cinema, \"The Artist\" features the career of a Douglas Fairbanks-esque movie star and the effect the introduction of sound has on his career. In a gimmicky but brilliant move, the black-and-white film is itself a silent movie.\n\nJean Dujardin is all smiles and bright eyes as silent movie star George Valentin as the movie begins. He's perfectly cast; he absolutely looks as if he could have existed in 1927 cinema. His slicked-back hair and perfectly styled mustache highlight his charming, roguish style and his devil-may-care attitude. The Jack Russell terrier that plays Valentin's sidekick is adorable and a high point of the film.\n\nValentin's chance encounter with dancer Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) gives her career a kick-start, but before long, the sound movies preferred by studio head Al Zimmer (John Goodman) leave Valentin on his own.\n\nValentin sinks his money into one last gamble, a silent film that will show the world why he should still be a star. But times have changed, and Valentin finds himself in worse and worse straits, certainly not helped along by the stock market crash.

{"text":"Update: Whoops! I originally posted that Raya Green was played by Vanessa Oryema. I was wrong - she's played by Rutina Wesley. Sorry!\n\nOk, I'll admit it, I kind of have a teen dance movie problem. One of my favourite movies of last year was Stomp the Yard (I will make an honest case for why I truly believe it is a passionate appeal for gender and racial equality! Also it is full of hot babes).\n\nBut while I understand why some might not quite agree that Stick It is among one of the most rousing and anti-establishment pieces of cinema of the early '00s, with ZERO guilty pleasure quotient I highly, heartily recommend How She Move.\n\nIn a word, what distinguishes How She Move from all the other teen dance movies that I hold dear to my heart, is how Real it is. And Realness is pretty unusual for a genre that can rarely hold itself back when it comes to fulfilling stereotypes about poor neighbourhoods, teenagers, men and women and physically impossible dance sequences.\n\nBoth the female and male characters span a broad spectrum of personalities, instead of falling into socially sanctioned roles of what it means to be a man or a woman. Or when they do fall into those roles, the motivations and reasons for why they choose to follow that path is clear - demonstrating (intentionally or not) that gender is learned rather than biological. That's a pretty hefty topic for a movie featuring Keyshia Cole in a cameo.\n\nMore than that, How She Move features Toronto neighbourhood Jane Finch in all its gritty glory (And yes, the story is actually set in Jane Finch - not Bed Stuy or 8 Mile. Whoohoo Canada!). Unlike other CanCon which tends to try and portray Toronto as a \"world-class city\" the film is honest about both the city's crappiness and potential. Which if you think about it, is more patriotic and loving to Toronto than trying to pretend that Toronto is New York City - despite the fact that the dialogue does still take potshots at poor old Scarborough.\n\nAnd if that's not enough, here's another great thing about How She Move: Rutina Wesley, who plays lead character Raya, just looks like a regular cute teenage girl, instead of a Pussycat Doll. EXTREMELY unusual for a teen dance movie. And Wesley plays Raya as a woman on her own terms, who has an extremely clear sense of what she wants, and is affected but not swayed by the heavy expectations that our culture has of women. And darn it, call me sucker but if that ain't inspirational I don't know what is.\n\nOh, and of course, the dance moves and convoluted plot will knock your socks off. But you already knew that. We are, after all, talking about a teen dance movie. Anyways, must dash, have to go get in line for advance tickets to Step Up 2: The Streets.\n\nPS A Film Friday on a Monday?

{"text":"Parents say\n\nKids say\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nParents need to know that The Intouchables is an award-winning French drama based on the true story of a wealthy quadriplegic and his down-and-out personal aide. Like most odd-couple stories, the drama includes worthwhile lessons about friendship being deeper than the superficial differences that divide people (in this case, race, wealth, education, and physical ability). It's subtitled, but there are about 10 translated uses of \"f--k,\" as well as \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" and other insults. There are several references to sex, an ongoing comedic flirtation between a man and an uninterested woman, and plenty of cigarettes, wine, and even some marijuana -- used both medicinally and for leisure.\n\nThe Intouchables offers valuable reminders about how you can't assume anything about anyone regardless of their wealth, education, or physical abilities. Philippe and Driss' trusting, open relationship proves that race, status, and disability don't have to be obstacles to understanding and unconditional friendship. Disability also doesn't have to stop a person from finding love.\n\nEven though they're employer and employee and of different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds, Philippe and Driss grow to respect and love each other, and each changes the other. Their odd-couple relationship transcends superficial differences and becomes based on their mutual ability to see beyond what others see in them.\n\nDriss intimidates a couple of guys (one of them a teen) by shoving them against a wall and getting in their face. The police -- with guns drawn -- handcuff and act rough with Driss until they notice Philippe in the car. Driss' younger brother is under a drug dealer's thumb. An older woman slaps a younger man. At one point, Philippe, a quadriplegic, looks like he's in distress and even about to die.\n\nA man shamelessly flirts with and propositions an uninterested woman, who sometimes plays along by unbuttoning her top a few buttons while the man disrobes down to his underwear. Bikini-clad \"massage therapists\" (prostitutes) have to be told not try to go below the waist. Teenagers make out until they're interrupted. A woman who's revealed to be a lesbian suggests a \"threesome\" but is doing it as a joke.\n\nThe movie is subtitled, so only French speakers will understand the spoken curse words. But in the subtitles, there are about 10 uses of \"f--k\" and even more of \"s--t,\" as well as \"a--hole,\" \"ass,\" and insults like \"moron,\" \"idiot, \" \"insane,\" \"jerk,\" \"crazy,\" and the occasional religious exclamation.\n\nThe movie takes place in France, where smoking cigarettes is still very common. Several characters smoke them, and adults are also shown smoking marijuana. Wine and cocktails are shown at every meal or party, and a teen girl purposely combines anti-diarrhea medication with painkillers after she's dumped (she's OK, though). A sick man takes many prescription drugs and uses pot to help with his appetite. A teen boy is arrested for marijuana possession.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nThe award-winning French drama THE INTOUCHABLES is about a rich, white Parisian quadriplegic who hires a black ex-con as his live-in personal assistant. Loosely based on a true story, the story follows how paralyzed aristocrat Philippe (Francois Cluzet) gives down-and-out petty criminal Driss (Omar Sy) a chance to be his health aide, even though there are many more qualified applicants. At first, Driss is skeptical and even disgusted by some of his responsibilities (like bathroom duty), but soon enough the two very different men come to understand and respect each other -- and help each other above and beyond any employer-employee dynamic.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nAs unlikely friendships in movies go, the one between Philippe and Driss is purely on the sweet and inspiring side. There's nothing all that complicated about their alliance. Wealthy Philippe and street Driss understand each other and can teach other the respective importance of Beethoven and Earth, Wind and Fire. Though Philippe can't drive, Driss can use his legs to drive Philippe's Maserati fast and furious, providing a thrill that Philippe thought he'd never feel again.\n\nAlthough deeper issues about the socio-economic divisions that separate Philippe and Driss aren't substantively explored, The Intouchables is a fantastically acted, surprisingly funny film. It's obvious what Driss gets from being Philippe's aide (a steady income, a ridiculously beautiful place to live, and all the other luxuries that being part of Philippe's household staff offers). But it's equally obvious how Philippe benefits from the relationship: He gets a sense of spontaneity, a lust for life, and a companion without pity. It's no wonder why France selected the feel-good movie as its 2012 submission to the Academy Awards for best foreign language The Intouchables teaches about disability. Why was Philippe happier with Driss as an aide than the other, more objectively qualified assistants? How did Driss treat Philippe differently than the others?\n\nSome critics have said the story dismisses any deep exploration of the differences (particularly race and class) between the two men. Do you agree?\n\nHow does the movie portray smoking? How is it different in that regard than an American movie?\n\nCritically acclaimed French drama goes a thin line between PG-13 and R!\n\n\"The Intouchables\" is a French drama based on a trues story. It was a huge success in Europe, bith financial and critical. I actually was surprised that this movie wasn't nominated for the Academy Award as \"Best Foreign Language Film\" since in Europe, this was the most acclaimed movie of the year.\n\"The Intouchables\" is a witty and sweet story about a friendship between the handicapped, but wealthy Philippe and the big-mouthed african-origined Driss. While they are both minorities, they both have faced the dark side of life. The two very different people learn from each other, and a very strong friendship begins.\nWhat makes \"The Intouchables\" more than just a French version of \"The Odd Couple\" is its original way of storytelling. It is serious and comic, both touching and funny. it is one of the few movies that doesn't focus on political correctness, but still treats everyone with respect. This is not a big budget Hollywood movie, and that what makes its charme. It lacks the structures we are used to, and brings in something new. Sometimes you don't need a plot twist or a highlight to make a movie good. If you expect a pure drama or comedy movie, you will be disappointed. But if you're open for something new, you'll be fine with this movie.\n(SPOILERS may follow:)\nThe movie is neither violent nor sexual. There are some verbal references to sex and sensuality (a character gets aroused by getting his ears rubbed), but it is at the PG-13 level.\nThere is one scene in which characters smoke marijuana, but there is not much talk about it. Since i'm strictly against drugs, I don't know if this will appeal to others. But it is not that strong. Know your kid.\nThere are about 10 uses of the f-word (in subtitles), very infequent.\nThis movie goes a thin line between PG-13 and R. If there was no language, it was PG-13 for drug abuse and some mild sex references.\n(END OF SPOILERS)\nI think it is okay for teens and up.\n\nGREAT MOVIE-ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE STUDYING FRENCH!\n\nThis is a fantastic, uplifting, movie with great messages about making the best of what you've got and never giving up. Some of the sexual references in this movie can be a bit confrounting (e.g. a man is aroused by people licking his ears) and there is a considerable amount of strong language. However, by the time your child is 15 I believe that there is nothing that they wouldn't be able"}
{"text":"Before and After\n\nMeryl Streep, Liam Neeson, Edward Furlong\n\nDirected by Barbet Schroeder\n\nWhen a book you buy into as much as Rosellen's Brown's Before and After becomes a movie you don't believe for a minute, you have to figure the problem is tone. Brown's 1992 novel was a human drama about a New England couple whose lives unravel when their teenage son is accused of murder. The film is a melodrama that substitutes theatrics for the fine grain of characterization. It plays like a trashy TV movie with an absurdly overqualified cast.\n\nThat's Meryl Streep, winner of a gazil-lion Oscar nominations, as cool Carolyn Ryan, the local pediatrician with the happy home life. That's Liam Neeson, Oscar nominee for \"Schindler's List,\" as passionate Ben Ryan, Carolyn's husband and the local celebrity owing to his metalwork sculptures. That's pouty Edward Furlong (Terminator 2) as Jacob Ryan, the 17-year-old accused of bashing in his girlfriend's head and hitting the highway without a word to his parents. That's Julia Weldon as Judith Ryan, the daughter nobody pays much attention to except that she's saddled with voice-over narration that sounds like Juliette Lewis' in Cape Fear, only even more irritating. OK, Weldon's an unknown. But how about Barbet Schroeder? He directed Reversal of Fortune. Or screenwriter Ted Tally? He adapted The Silence of the Lambs.\n\nYou get my drift. These people should know better then to write, direct and perform in a movie that seems cobbled together out of highlights from the book like a Reader's Digest condensation. Bing, the murder. Bang, the capture. Boom, the trial. The connecting tissue of the novel, the stuff that made us ache for the family as it tried to determine whether Jacob was capable of murder, is glossed over. Streep has a few provocative scenes with Alfred Molina as Panos, Jacob's fast-talking lawyer. The rest of the acting is either overheated (Neeson) or underdone (Furlong).

{"text":"Main Menu\n\nANTIVIRAL\n\nCULT OF CELEBRITY\n\nThere's a moment in Brandon Cronenberg's debut feature-length film, Antiviral, when protagonist Sid March (Caleb Landry Jones) explains that celebrities are social and cultural collaborations, not real people. In a film that is obsessed with our own obsession for celebrities, this makes sense: like any massive, accelerated, hyper-visible cultural construct, celebrities are more flattened icons of representation than bodily incarnations of identity. Therein lies the crux of Antiviral: the process of celebrity has accelerated at such a rate that it threatens to disembody us, creating shadow selves that exist regardless of time and place, in a cultural vacuum of consumption.\n\nAntiviral follows Sid as he negotiates a society in which people overtly and constantly consume celebrities, not just in \"traditional\" ways, through television and print, but literally, too, as people line up outside butchers serving steaks made grown from celebrity cells, or fork over a pretty penny to be infected with the same virus their favourite celebrity currently carries.\n\nSid becomes the object of intense scrutiny when, though his own addiction, he is infected with the same virus that threatens to kill Hannah Geist, the film's most fetishized celebrity. As he races to try and figure out what it is that is killing her, all the while avoiding the corporations who would rather keep him sick in an effort to market and sell the virus to millions of others, his addiction spirals out of control and he begins to lose his own body and sense of self.\n\n\"I think people become celebrities through repeated imagery,\" begins Cronenberg. \"Once someone is visible enough, they start to take on a significance. They also become an icon, something recognizable and people feel they have a personal relationship with them.\" That Cronenberg actively identifies celebrities as icons is telling: in semiotic theory, notably Charles Pierce's tripartite model, an icon is a first-order sign, instantly recognizable with a minimum of cultural investment, a flattened (re)presentation of reality. An icon immediately says something and is understandable across most experience, and is most closely tied to that which it represents, but it is also the shallowest. Indexes and symbols, on the other hand, allow for much more interpretive work.\n\nThe theme of repetition is prevalent at all times in Antiviral. From the looped video footage of Hannah Geist \u2014 \"Isn't she perfect?\" breathes Sid. \"She's almost more than perfect,\" he says as part of his sales pitch for the Lucas Clinic, a telling thought in how celebrities' images work to transcend our bodily limitations in the pursuit of perfection \u2014 to the constantly flickering television screens on which people seem to solely watch tabloid programming screaming sex scandal after sex scandal, to the ultimately creepy posters of Geist herself looming far larger than life over everyone in every public space, her \"more than perfect\" eyes glittering, watching, over everyone like some kind of beautiful Big Brother, Antiviral drives home the point that accelerated, endless repetition robs us of our bodily reality.\n\n\"I think celebrities are cultural constructs, media constructs,\" Cronenberg says. \"They're loosely based on human beings, but they're fictional characters. A lot of what is reported in the celebrity news world is just made up. A lot of celebrities are sort of deified and we see them by way of media collaboration, I guess. Whereas the human being lives and decays and dies, the celebrity appears 40 years later in a vacuum cleaner commercial.\"\n\nCronenberg alludes to this sense that there is something truer than representation in our own bodies, perhaps hinting at the branch of existentialism that rose to favour in France in the '80s, following the politics of second wave feminism, that places prominence on the ontogenetic qualities of a body that movies. Philosophers like Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari pose that there are actually two planes of existence: a \"molar\" one, which is the plane of representation, on which celebrities' images clearly proliferate, and a \"molecular\" plane, which is the plane of the body that moves, the moving body, and cannot be contained by narrative (or image, to that extent). Antiviral traffics in this tension, in the disconnect between the represented world of images and the world we experience and create through our own flesh.\n\n\"Bodies are supposed to be imperfect,\" furthers Cronenberg. \"It's sort of part of the human condition, though that's cliche. It's part of our existence as human beings: we tend to strive for permanence and perfection, we want to strive to live forever. The fact that our desires with regards to ourselves are immediately at odds with our realities. We lose perspective if we deny ourselves as animals.\n\n\"There are two elements (to celebrity): one, it's a culture that fetishizes the body, so the film had to fetishize the body. The other aspect was this making explicit the body that culture is trying to ignore. There's a fetishization, like who has the worst cellulite in celebrity magazines, but to reconnect this uncomfortable human body in the face of this inhuman icon-making deification.\"\n\nIndeed, Cronenberg, much like his father's work before him, has mastered the tools of psychoanalysis, which have informed so much classical film theory. Fetishization and voyeurism are rife throughout Antiviral: not only is does the dystopic technology at the centre of the film \u2014 the ability to overtly consume celebrities \u2014 suggest an active cutting and compartmentalizing of celebrity bodies, but there are constant flashes of new technologies, too, that are able to see further into (female, always female, according to classical Hollywood narrative, which Antiviral ultimately tries to invert) bodies, to the point where internal sexual organs are on full display. Furthermore, cameras everywhere suggest a culture of voyeurism where everyone can see the celebrities, but they cannot (ostensibly) see back. Of course, a culture of voyeurism bleeds into a culture of surveillance and the erotic power imbalance between the holder of the gaze and the object of the gaze is complicated.\n\n\"I think there's an interesting power dynamic when it comes to voyeurism. The whole scene in Levin's club is the whole idea that people crave this power dynamic and it feeds voyeurism. If you're invading people's lives and mocking them, seeing them at the beach, catching them naked, it's a position of power \u2014 you're the all-seeing eye,\" agrees Cronenberg. \"The reality is that you don't really have power over people, but the more they become significant, the more there is a desire to have this power over them.\"\n\nAs this desire accelerates, Sid's body begins to deteriorate from Geist's unknown virus. Barely even able to hold himself up, he, like a junkie, continues to crave the source of his illness. In his depths, Sid croaks, \"I'm approximating myself,\" alluding to this tension between identity and desire, suggesting that we can never really be ourselves, not in the presence of such a proliferation of our own images.\n\n\"I was thinking about states of being sickly, or not just being sick, but, kind of those moments where we create these characters for ourselves that are fictional in a way. We touch on these things and we need them to function, but, at the same time, they're not inherent to who we are. It's still a fiction and still something we create for ourselves.\""}
{"text":"Inside 'The Brown Bunny' with Vincent Gallo\n\n--Page 3\n\nIf people are only focused on the controversial issues surrounding this movie, especially on the graphic sexual issues, what are they missing? They're missing what children miss when they're in a car traveling to a place they want to go. They're missing the experience of getting there. They're missing all the beautiful things that are happening on their way there, and they're missing the continuity of what the entire trip as a whole means to them. So they're missing things the way adolescents miss things. If you look at that film without prejudice or hearsay or, even worse, suspicion about why it was made and what my intentions were to make it, then you become unaware of the multi-complex innuendos, narrations, aesthetics, and sensibilities, and concepts, and nuances, and melodramas that happen along the way.\n\nI'm more attracted to the first part of the film than I am the last part of the film. The last part of the film works juxtaposed against the first part of the film, but it's a more conventional It becomes slightly more conventional. The part of the film that really engages me, the most beautiful scene in the movie to me is the scene between Cheryl Tiegs and I. I think what people miss if they put focus on the part of the film that they deem exploitive or titillating, they miss the film as a whole. And they certainly misinterpret the scene that encompasses them.\n\nYou had that scene blown up on a billboard on Sunset Blvd. That's a conscious choice in marketing the film and the marketing campaign of 'the most controversial American film ever made,' it's going to define the movie. People can't help but go into the movie thinking about that. Well, I'll respond to that simply by saying I've made six posters for the movie. I've done all the synopsis, all the trailers, everything. And the line 'controversy' had nothing to do with the sex, it had to do with Lisa Schwarzbaum and people saying it was the worst movie ever made. It wasn't an address to sexuality.\n\nAll the other pamphlets and formatting and imagery and text that I presented about the movie is highly intellectualized, highly conceptual, extremely discreet, and extremely conceptual in its aesthetics - in direct relationship to the film itself. The billboard on Sunset Blvd. was a much more broad concept for me. I designed it, I choose it, I paid for it. Okay. It happens in these ways: First of all, it's the dream of my life since I'm a teenager to have a billboard on Sunset Blvd. because when I'm in LA I don't watch TV, I don't read the newspaper, I don't listen to the radio. I only know about contemporary culture by broad advertisements. But I felt, first of all just as a person, it was a dream sort of to be able to have a billboard and to be able to pick what it was. That said, the billboard itself whatever boldness it has, whatever appeal it had, the intentions were that the appeal would be aesthetic and intellectual. I mean, the only people who would respond to that billboard in a way where they really understood the sensibility of that billboard would be people who were evolved on some level. That was not a mainstream provocateur. I mean, across the street you'd have a Calvin Klein ad where the girl is fisting the boy and her boob is out, and she's dripping. Mine is in black and white \u2013 you can't really see anything. There's no boobs, there's no nipples, there's nothing. It's done in a blown out half-tone. The whole billboard has no corporate names, it has no quotes from festivals. It has nothing. It's done in a style or a tradition of classic adult cinema and the reference is that this film is A) an event \u2013 that those actors are substantial. And the purpose was to take away the marginal perception of the film. If people think that this is an art film, it's offensive to me. They think it's a self-indulgent, narcissistic film with a sex act. It's offensive to me.\n\nI was trying to give imagery that would relate to the other corporate advertisements to suggest that the film had a corporate element, or that it was Certainly that it was not marginal and it was not 'artistic' in the classic sense. It was bigger than that. It transcended the Sundance Film Festival, or just the American film with the European ending \u2013 or something like that. I didn't want anything like that and I didn't want the hearsay to continue without addressing it. I wanted to show that the film was provocative, that it was in this tradition of adult cinema \u2013 \"Last Tango,\" \"Midnight Cowboy,\" whatever. But I wanted to do it on my own terms. I wanted to use provocative images that were beautiful, dramatic, aesthetic, clearly outside of mainstream eroticism."}

{"text":"Confession time: I had little faith in this movie. The trailers did not inspire me, and the joke-y fake commercials (for kilts and records and stuff) that Pixar released outright annoyed me. I didn't know what to make of any of it. It felt like the movie wanted to be something big and dramatic but then you had jokes that fell flat (the old dude lifting up his kilt just made me cringe) and smelled of bad Dreamworks fluff. And then there's the film's somewhat possibly troubled production: the first director, Brenda Chapman got replaced by Mark Andrews during production, which did not inspire confidance (though, to be fair, that could be for any number of reasons unrelated to the quality of the work Chapman was doing). And yet, it should be noted that both are credited as directors of the final product, so it's not like Chapman was erased from the movie entirely.\n\nBut yeah, I walked in with doubts. And then something happened\u2026\n\nThose damn PIXAR shorts, I tell you. Once again, after the last trailer played itself out and the usher closed the theater doors, the screen lit up with the PIXAR logo and we were treated to La Luna, honestly one of the loveliest shorts the studio has ever produced. Gorgeously shot, animated and paced, it is simply, only, completely breathtaking. I mean look at that image up there! If nothing else, La Luna is worth the price of admission. But that's not fair because, as it turns out, BRAVE is really good\u2026\n\nSo the Short film ended and I was so in awe, so happy with what I'd just seen, I decided to let go of all preconceptions I had about BRAVE and to just enjoy what ever PIXAR had in store for me.\n\nBRAVE is a film, first and foremost, about a mother (Elinor) and a daughter (Merida). The mother has expectations and the daughter is not in the least bit interested in meeting them. That isn't to say that Merida is mean-spirited or anything, she just has different aspirations. Obviously the focus of the movie is on her, but Elinor is a huge part of the proceedings and very central to the movie. In any case, the big reason why this movie worked for me is that I liked, respected and rooted for both characters equally. How great is that? The mother is not evil, the daughter is not a brat. Their agendas just happen to clash at this point in their lives. Mistakes (really really grave mistakes) are made, lessons are learned, and in the end\u2026 well, let's not give away the end\u2026\n\nThere is no bad guy in this movie, only bad decisions, only inner turmoil. It's an interesting choice and it feels refreshing. In fact I'd be tempted to tell you this movie is a family drama if it wasn't so funny. But it's funny. There are a dozen side characters that get their moments, most prominently the king (husband and father of the two protagonists) and the three princes. Because, oh, yeah, the daughter in question is a princess. This is a princess fairytale, get with it.\n\nA lot has been said about the fact that this is the first PIXAR film centered on a (or two, in my humble opinion) female character. PIXAR have always been great with female characters, to be fair, even if they have so far been relegated to secondary parts. Helen Parr\/Elastigirl (The Incredibles) and Colette (Ratatouille) come to mind as very strong and well written female roles (better written, in fact, than many female leading roles of the same period, be they animation OR live-action). That being said, there is no denying that BRAVE is a movie where the fairer gender just shines. Merida and Elinor are fantastically portrayed, deep and complex characters that love eachother deeply but have reached a point where communication has simply seazed to function. They're at an impass and the movie really resonates when that turmoil between them finally reaches boiling point. Given that the two characters are voiced by amazing actresses (Kelly MacDonald and Emma Thompson), any scene they have together resonates. I'm glad my nieces will see this, I'm glad they have these women to look up to.\n\nThis movie is also absolutely gorgeous to look at. that's an easy statement to make about a PIXAR film but here they have yet again completely outdone themselves. I could smell the fresh forest air and the morning dew. I could feel the sun on my face. I wholly believed in this world, and I thought it was beautiful.\n\nSome of the ads for the movie want you to believe that it's epic and it's not. They want you to believe that it's full of action and it isn't. There is seriously barely any. It's a very personal, gorgeously shot, fairytale\/drama about a princess who is at odds with her Queen's expectations of her. And it's funny, not always ha-ha funny, but if anything, always charming-funny. I could have done without the old dude lifting his kilt and saying feast your eyes, but in context it plays better than in the trailer\u2026\n\nThe film's structure is very loose, and this is where the movie sometimes leaves a little to be desired. It doesn't feel as tight as other PIXAR efforts, like there could have been another pass or two done to the script. Still, as I write this, I wonder what I would cut and I can't think of anything. There is a big plot point half way through the movie the forces a sort of division, give the movie an episodic feel. Thing A happens, then thing B, thing C, all the way to Z. And, pfffff, you know what? There's nothing wrong with that. It's just not a movie that flies by you \u00e0 la The Incredibles or Up!, whewre everything is so tight and every story beat just punches you in the face with it's effectiveness. No, BRAVE takes it's sweet time and invites you to do the same. You're rewarded if you accept the pace.\n\nAt the end of the day I don't think this will be remembered as an all around classic like Toy Story or Up!, movies that feel timeless upon the very first viewing, with incredible resonnance, but it's a very strong, if loose, effort by the greatest movie studio operating today.\n\nA bunch of peeps I know saw it last Summer at the Fantasia film fest and they all loved it. It's one of the few I missed out on and it's coming out in February. There's a trailer out there that I refuse to see. I'm going in this one clean.\n\n-John Carter\n\nAndrew Stanton follows in the footsteps of fellow Pixar wizard (yes, they are wizards, be silent) Brad Bird and makes the jump to live action. He's adapting pulp classic The Princess of Mars, the first John Carter adventure, published around 1917 or something. People will inevitably accuse it of ripping off Avatar and Starwars and stuff. These people will have the whole thing ass over tits. John Carter was seducing otherwordly princesses before it got cool.\n\n-The Cabin in the woods\n\nWhen Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard team up to take horror genre conventions for a spin, you stop whatever you're doing and you bask in their collective genius like the puny lesser human that you are. Or at least I will.\n\n-Marvel's The Avengers\n\nJoss Whedon is given amazing toys and ressources to pit Iron Man and Hulk and all their buddies against something probably mean and rude. I'm there.\n\n-Prometheus\n\nRidley Scott returns to the world his Alien franchise takes place in. I think this movies happens before all that stuff though. In any event it'll look great. Also it has Michael Fassbender in it and I'm at least 5% gay for him.\n\n-Brave\n\nIt's Pixar doing a movie not involving cars, so I'm in.\n\n-The Dark Knight Rises\n\nUm. You really need a description?\n\n-Looper\n\nRyan Johnson did an amazing film called BRICK, then he followed that up with a fantastic and completely different film called THE BROTHERS BLOOM. LOOPER is his third film, that's enough for me. But hey, when it's about future Bruce Willis being time machined back to the present to be assassinated by his younger self (played by regular joe Joseph Gordon Levitt) it seriously garantees my ass in the seat.\n\n-The motherlovin' Hobbit\n\n(that's not an official poster, there isn't one yet)\n\nI just like their hairy feet.\n\n-Django Unchained\n\n(that's not an official poster, there isn't one yet)\n\nQuentin Tarantino is doing a cowboy movie about an escaped slave seeking vengeance or justice or something equally badass. Look, it's Tarantino and he's in my top five. I'm going.\n\nThat's it for now. I'm sure I'm forgetting a thousand movies but it's 6 AM and I really should find my keys."}

{"text":"Lifestream\n\nNews for the 'Foreign+' Category\n\nDogtooth (Kynodontas, Greece)\n\nThree children (Aggeliki Papoulia, Christos Passilas, and Mary Tsoni) live a sheltered existence with their parents (Christos Stergioglou and Michele Valley) who control them to the extreme in order to protect them from the rest of society. They invent an older brother who, they tell the children, ventured outside the confines of the estate and was killed by a vicious, flesh eating cat. The parents improvise new definitions for words like sea (an armchair) and zombie (little yellow flower) to further isolate them from anything beyond their bizarre, manipulated microcosm.\n\nThe children's only link to the outside world is Christina (Anna Kalaintzidou), a security guard at the father's workplace, who is paid to relieve the son of his sexual urges. One day, Christina offers a present to the oldest daughter but she is obligated to give her something in return \u2013 oral sex. The family structure starts to unravel once Christina is gone and the oldest daughter is forced to replace her role as the son's personal prostitute. Whatever cruel punishment her father exacts, the oldest daughter isn't deterred from rebelling and, eventually, going to great lengths to gain her freedom.\n\nDogtooth, original Greek title of Kynodontas, is shocking and depraved. This is not for most people and most definitely not for anyone under the age of 18. With multiple sex scenes (a few including incest and a very graphic fellatio clip from a pornographic video tape), an act of animal cruelty, violence and bloodshed, child abuse, and full frontal male and female nudity, this is not for the casual viewer. It seems the only debauchery left out of the film is bestiality (thank goodness).\n\nThe dialog is painful to endure at times but the acting is kind of hypnotic. In fact, it's hard to stop watching entirely because of how inappropriate and insane the movie is. It plays out in a silly fashion with the lies the parents tell the children elevating to absurdity for their own selfish desires (e.g., Frank Sinatra is their grandfather so they have a reason to listen to his records).\n\nFor me, the highlight of Dogtooth is when the two daughters dance for the parents, who are celebrating their anniversary, while the son strums an expressive tune on the guitar. An innocent, reverent dance with her younger sister turns into a frenzied solo interpretation of Flashdance that becomes so intense, she's ordered by her mother to stop. Imagine contestants on shows like America's Got Talent or So You Think You Can Dance who are aired only because their dancing is so horrendous, so hilarious, so over-the-top, but so full of spirit that it must be witnessed."}
{"text":"Summary:\nA well-made talking heads doc, \"The 11th Hour\" takes a doom and gloom approach to the earth's current plight, but it also offers a ray of hope and intelligent solutions for making a change, hopefully not too late to make a difference.\n\nStory:\nThis comprehensive documentary examines how the very presence of man on earth has made it so the planet may one day soon be completely uninhabitable, hence the film's title, which states that the earth as we know it is in its 11th hour.\n\nAnalysis:\nAs surprising as it is that it took an ex-Vice President to convince Americans that global warming was a serious problem which needed to be addressed, \"An Inconvenient Truth\" only was one part of the equation. What the Oscar-winning doc began last year, \"The 11th Hour\" continues, taking a very different tact, one that might not be nearly as effective at getting its message across, but deserves respect for making the effort.\n\nThe gist of the film's thesis paper centers around how the enormous population growth in the last forty years is killing the planet, particularly because man's greed and desire to expand and grow has destroyed many of the earth's defenses against natural disasters. It's an intelligent and solidly-constructed documentary that collects dozens of interviews with scientists and experts who corroborate that the very existence of humankind is what's destroying the planet and making it uninhabitable for life. These interviews are cut together with gorgeous and often harrowing images of the planet and accompanied by a haunting ambient score, and every once in a while, producer Leonardo DiCaprio shows up to add his two cents, ably reading them from cue cards. It's almost too comprehensive in the amount of ground it covers, as it ties together many environmental hot topics like Hurricane Katrina, the melting polar ice caps and the destruction of the Brazilian rainforests, going into depth of why they're important at reducing the floods that have ravaged so much of the globe.\n\nIt's very much a talking heads movie, but at least it has something to say and it doesn't talk down to its viewer. That said, it's not exactly packaged for the layman or woman i.e. the average Joe or Jill who might get the most out of this information either. Instead, it's a film so full of techno-babble and eco-jargon that you'd have to be a MENSA member to really understand half of what is being said, and it's more likely to have an impact on businessmen or politicians who may be able to enact the necessary changes warranted. Even Leonardo DiCaprio's scripted bits seem too smart for the film's purposes-- they're more like a college lecture--and it's sorely lacking what Al Gore brought to \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" a charming and charismatic spokesman that can sell the ideas and offer the spoonful of sugar needed to help the medicine go down. It's a shame because there are many important facts and figures here, but they may be too much for one person to absorb without completely zoning out.\n\nThe movie spends most of its time going over all the problems and how many of them are irreparable, but just as you're about to slit your wrists, the movie suggests there may still be time for people to change their habits and make a difference. It proceeds to offer smart solutions in its last act, which can't be said about \"An Inconvenient Truth\" which waited until the end credits when most people would be walking out of the theatre. By the point that \"The 11th Hour\" changes gears, it's unlikely that anyone who's sat through the first hour will be so numbed by what was said to not want to get involved and take action, so the movie does end on a note of optimism and hope, one that's far more positive and fulfilling than all the earlier doom-mongering.\n\nUnfortunately, the people who really need to see this movie and make changes, those who continue to wantonly destroy the earth and its environment, will probably never see this movie, and even if they do, it's not likely they'll understand enough to realize importance of making those changes. For everyone else, you'll just have to accept the fact that the end is nigh."}
{"text":"Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers does a most difficult and brave thing and does it brilliantly. It is a movie about a concept. Not just any concept but the shop-worn and often wrong-headed idea of \"heroism.\"\n\nIt's a noble undertaking, and Eastwood is stylistically bold enough to create a view of combat based mainly on images that are clearly manufactured. (As with \"Saving Private Ryan,\" the movie's principal source is \"The Big Red One,\" whose director, Samuel Fuller, actually experienced the war.) But this is underimagined and so thesis ridden that it's nearly over before it starts.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever given a movie a ten on MetaCritic. This is definitely one of the best, if not the absolute best, WW2 films ever created. It pays its respects to the soldiers who fought in WW2, but at the same time it shows the other side of the story. Similar to the fictional Catch 22, it depicts the ugly side of America and her military during a time of war. If you are into World War 2 video games, books, movies, you MUST see this movie! The realism and authenticity of the battle scenes are worth it by itself, and the political and philosophical themes will get you thinking, long after you've seen the movie.\u2026Expand\n\nDirector and American icon Clint Eastwood follows up Million Dollar Baby, which was controversial but shouldn't have been, with a surprisingly subversive critique of America's participation in the Last Good War that even managed to hoodwink ultrapatriotic right-wing movie reviewer Michael Medved (Baby's prime and most notorious detractor) into uncritically awarding it three and a half stars. (Maybe it's the title.) While Eastwood and writers Paul Haggis and William Broyles Jr. never mention Iraq, the parallels are certainly there for all to see: their movie's vision of World War II is one where funding and public support are controlled and manipulated by (largely fraudulent) PR gimmicks, and both Jessica Lynch and Pat Tillman are shown to have historical predecessors. Ultimately, this is all a lot more interesting to discuss than to actually watch: Eastwood's storytelling approach derails itself with a tortuous, serpentine flashback-within-flashback structure of the kind that occasionally works in romantic dramas and spy thrillers but virtually NEVER in war movies, as the poor reception given to the similarly-structured 1944 Humphrey Bogart French Resistance drama Passage to Marseille (made by the people behind Casablanca) will bear out. (Saving Private Ryan wisely limited itself to making the entire movie a simple journey through only one character's past; perhaps Steven Spielberg, doing co-producer duty here, was trying to top himself. If so, quit while you're ahead!) Eastwood's use of decolorized cinematography in his depiction of the struggle for Iwo Jima is visually effective but nowhere near as gripping or as frightening as Ryan's opening battle sequence, and the use of highly unconvincing special effects and props to depict battlefield gore doesn't work at all. Actors as frequently bland as Jesse Bradford, Ryan Phillippe and Paul Walker, playing servicemen, do nothing to intensify our identification with them, and the only time Flags of Our Fathers really hits the mark is in its fascinating portrayal of Pima Indian Ira Hayes (movingly played by Adam Beach) who generally accepted racist jokes about squaws and wigwams from his fellow Marines as good-natured male bonding but couldn't handle the official and unofficial racism of the folks back home, and because of that AND the knowledge that he was ordered to promulgate a fraud for the sake of building support for the war and selling war bonds, became one of World War II's most poignant psychological casualties. In the last couple of months, we moviegoers have been treated to two inspirational football dramas, two period pieces involving magicians, and THREE films in which a real-life character is so fascinating and beautifully played that he just dwarfs all the other stuff surrounding him. Put together a three-part movie consisting of just the George Reeves material from Hollywoodland, the Idi Amin footage in The Last King of Scotland and everything involving Hayes in this picture, and the resulting anthology would be a prime contender for one of the 10 best films of 2006!\u2026Expand\n\nThe direction, acting and painfully boring political spectrum involving the war leads to a war movie that has each character mearly one politicians handshake away from becoming a cliched and forgettable film experience. There is absolutely no connection between the characters and with such long pauses between past, present, future and politics you almost forget that Eastwood set out to do a film about war. This movie is definietly not worth the time and suggest seeing Letters from Iwo Jima where Eastwood gets it right\u2026Expand"}
{"text":"Podcasts\n\nJuno and the Paycock (1929)\n\nThe first few decades of cinema suffered from the same missteps video games are going through right now: trying too hard to fall back on what makes other mediums great. A number of current blockbuster video games end up being terrible games because they attempt to capture film experiences instead of game experiences. About 80 years ago, film was having the same problem by attempting to capture the experience of watching stage plays.\n\nThe closest Juno and the Paycock comes to realizing any of the potential artistry of film is in the opening moments when a crowd runs away from a flurry of gunfire. The film cuts away from the crowd to a cat scurrying up a street light. From that shot on, the rest of the film is comprised of droll, stilted shots that watch their subjects as they, talk, sing and get into various forms of trouble.\n\nBut even as a play, Juno and the Paycock doesn't seem to be that compelling. From the opening moments, there's a dissonance between the backdrop of the Irish revolution and the characters that comprise the film. Even though they live among such turmoil, they appear oblivious and immune to its effects. The aforementioned scene where the crowd runs away from gunfire is followed by a scene where two of the main characters quip back and forth at the local pub after closely dodging death.\n\nThe film strains for a good laugh, but neither the jokes nor the delivery is close to amusing. There's not a laugh to be found within the film's runtime. Furthermore, after a solid hour or so of comedic farce, the film tries to take a dark turn and it doesn't work. Not a moment in this film makes one sympathetic or interested in the placid and dull characters, and watching them go through a challenging time lacks any resonance.\n\nAt a little under 90 minutes, the film never goes anywhere meaningful or takes the time to develop anything. Perhaps in the length of the play, there was time to explore and develop these characters. In the film, it's just another farce, another jab and another gag that fails to add up to anything. There's even ten minutes of people sitting around and singing for no particular reason.\n\nJuno and the Paycock is miserable in just about every way imaginable. It fails to recognize any of the potency or life to be found in the potential of film as an expressive medium. There's not a moment of life, vibrancy or joy to be found in this film, just a procedural series of events that add up to nothing. It's a reminded of how backwards the advent of sound was at the time, look at films from just 2 years before and they're a decade ahead of Juno and the Paycock in terms of style, creativity and wit.\n\nOne Response to Juno and the Paycock (1929)\n\nDitto. It's amazing how badly the switch to sound screwed up Hollywood. When you look at films like Sunrise or Metropolis and then\u2026 pretty much anything with sound in 1928 and 29? No comparison. The films are just ugly and loud."}

{"text":"ActionFest Repertoire Review: \"Beat\" Takeshi's OUTRAGE\n\nFrom time to time we will be reviewing films from our ActionFest Repertoire since there is so much great stuff that has played at our festival which is just now coming out on home video or is still upcoming. Outrage screened at ActionFest 2011 and recently became available on home video.\n\nTakeshi Kitano directed, wrote, and starred in the latest yakuza movie to hit the big screen, and now your home entertainment system. Outrage is the mobster story he made to entertain us, where one low level mobster hacks off the tip of his pinkie finger, only to have Otomo (Kitano) slash an X-marks-the-spot on his face. It's merely the beginning of a violent tale of retribution that will escalate through the remainder of the movie.\n\nCrime boss Sekiuchi (Kitamura Soichiro) finds a prison saki deal between one of his underlings (Jun Kunimura) and an outsider named Murase (Renji Ishibashi) to be unacceptable, so he sets out to bring them in line. His right hand man passes the buck down the line to Otomo, who (with a stony disposition) carries out the subsequent beatings and murders with reckless abandon. So many insubordinate mobsters to whack, so little time. Of course, each act of violence brings a return that escalates the violence (a murder for a beating) until it's all-out war.\n\nThere's comic irony here, but it is black comedy. Each underling thinks that he's the next man up, better than whoever is over him, and determined to climb the food chain. But the overall perspective that the audience can see is that none of them are all that smart. They're like an army charging en masse at the oncoming army that out mans and outguns them in a style of war that expects an honor among thieves that doesn't last.\n\nEven as Otomo acts with violence predicated by his orders, he's expecting a certain samurai-like code to rule the day. Instead he gets a dog-eat-dog scenario where the deals are crossed up by better deals, a word is not the bond between two men, and everyone would do anything to get ahead. It's done against a backdrop of techno bass beat, with an abundance of dialogue and exacting violence interspersed throughout. Fans of mobster flicks will dig it, as the violence accelerates, each payment increasing on what came before. A beating requires a violent dental extraction which leads to chopsticks going where they don't belong, and a soup you'd never want to eat.\n\nOverall, the action is too far spread apart, and the dialogue too campy to warrant ownership. But if mob-related action gets your attention then Outrage is worth the viewing even if you need the English subtitles. Still, it's like most of the great foreign flicks (think Pan's Labyrinth): this story is shot well enough that it doesn't matter if you can't hear it with chopsticks in your ears."}
{"text":"Michael Green's review:\n\nThe critics are largely unanimous that this is the film of the year. I find no cause for dispute - this is an exceptionally well made and thought provoking family drama. While the core thread of the story may be considered somewhat unique to Iran the, themes of morality and virtues are universal. The tagline 'ugly truth, sweet lies' really captures the essence of a film that goes further than simply explore the cultural roles within modern Iranian society, it challenges the morality. This is the stuff of defining cinema. You could equally watch this without the sound on and still come away with the same sense of emotion and understanding of cultural roles. But to only talk about how great the events of the film are is to miss one of the most exceptional elements - the way director Farhadi uses the camera will have you glued to every shot."}
{"text":"I've been working through the movies of Danish director Lars von Trier for the past few weeks, a project that I took up knowing mostly his current reputation as a divisive figure, the maker of movies that some people accuse of being simple exercises in provocation. What's been interesting is that while his works (particularly the early ones) engender a discussion of how much they say anything other than say it stylishly, none of the movies have been particularly 'shocking'. I know I'm a jaded viewer, but I'd like to think I'm not completely numb to those things.\n\nWell, that changes today.\n\nBut first I think we need a history lesson. Two weeks ago I talked about the Dogme 95 movement, but didn't really explain it. Unfortunately, we're at the point where that's no longer an option, as the movie we're watching today is the only Dogme film von Trier has made to date (likely the only one he will make, I'd guess). So to approach the film one must understand some of the ideas and restrictions wrapped around it.\n\nCreated by Lars von Trier and fellow Danish director Thomas Vinterberg, Dogme 95 was a filmmaking movement the two men thought up as a rejection of 'traditional' movie-making, which they both claimed was far too artificial and philosophically impure to create moving, worthwhile art. So they wrote out a manifesto of 'vows of chastity', limits on what Dogme films could include in order to qualify. This was to return cinema to its immediate roots, inexpensive and immediate. The rules can be found on the wikipedia page, if that interests you, but mostly they were straightforward: no sets, no props, no special effects, no score (outside of what's naturally in the world), no tripods or crane shots or Steadicam. In fact, no action or genre works, nor period or fantasy, were allowed. Dogme movies take place here and now, and are different from cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 primarily in that they use real actors who follow these rules as well.\n\nThe Dogme 95 movement took off in certain arthouse circles primarily because it cut out a lot of the expense of making a movie. Sure, one of the rules was that you still shoot on film, but the productions were by and large otherwise very accessible, low budget affairs just because there wasn't anything to spend money on. When you don't have all the trappings of a production, you don't have a big crew either, and so the whole thing immediately becomes much cheaper. That said, Dogme was not without its criticisms. It is such a stringent set of rules that the movies in question are all kind of ugly affairs, in particular the rule that states that there can be no camera mountings lead to a lot of handheld 35 mm shooting, which in the mid-90s was a far more horrifying prospect to people than it is today, when rampant handheld has infested every level of movie making.\n\nAnd there's a question of just how seriously Lars von Trier took the very idea. In some ways it was a publicity stunt, as von Trier used an opportunity to speak on the future of film at a French film festival to paper the audience with Dogme 95 manifesto pamphlets, only to later admit that he wrote the rules down on a whim one day, while drunk, in a scant 45 minutes. Which is just another wrinkle in the frustrating duology of von Trier. The idea to create a genre of cinema that's not beholden to the massive budgets and excess of 95% of film is a noble one, but von Trier can't do anything genuine without adding a level of showmanship that makes you half convinced he's doing it just to get a rise out of people.\n\nAs it is, Dogme 95 has produced a few dozen movies from various directors, mostly foreign language films, but it never really took off as an actual revolution of cinema. Partially due to just how restrictive it is, but also probably due to the influx of people in the past decade who have had great success with no-budget cinema in a post-digital camera world. And even the films that did supposedly adhere to the principles regularly violated one or more of the rules, as shooting a film with no artifice other than narrative is apparently next to impossible if you want to have a real product on the other end. But it is a key part of von Trier's evolution and influence, part of the reason he's such a controversial figure particularly among long-time critics, and explains some of why today's film is the way it is.\n\nThe Idiots (1998)\n\nSo let me just lay down the plot of The Idiots for you, free of value judgements, so you know what we're getting into: The Idiots is the story of a woman named Karen (Bodil Jorgensen) who encounters a group of adults who have an unconventional sort of performance art. They go into public spaces, or the house where they're all squatting, and unleash their 'inner idiot,' which often involves acting developmentally disabled, in order to seek a sort of societal and emotional freedom that they feel their bourgeois setting is built to repress. They do this by spassing, which involves things such as group trips to restaurants or public pools, where one of them acts as the 'normal' supervisor of the group while the rest act out, and then they all gather back home to talk about their experiences.\n\nSo I've lost most of you already, I'm sure. This movie was controversial upon release and it still feels absolutely shocking on a fundamental level that it exists even today. Part of it is cultural norms, but as someone raised to even question the use of the word 'retarded' as a pejorative, the idea of adults emulating the behaviors of actually disabled people hits all my 'offensive' buttons. But that's no surprise, because this is Lars von Trier, and in all things he seeks to provoke and scandalize as much as he does make genuine statements. So while plenty has been written on the moral questions of making this your subject for a film, I don't think that discussion is terribly interesting. This probably should offend you, but if you're interested in seeking stuff beyond it, we'll talk about those things. If you'd rather just consider the whole premise too much? Can't say I blame you. Adi\u00f3s, vaya con dios, and see you around, as next week's movie is much more conventional.\n\nWhat's most interesting is that behind all of that initial shock and scandal is one of the more human of von Trier's films. It plays out as almost a documentary of this fictional dadaist performance art troupe, as they act out as both a way to entertain themselves and as a profound sort of therapy that they seem nearly guilty admitting. The movie, shot in a smeary hand-held that looks unlike the entirety of von Trier's other filmography, seems almost like a found footage movie at times (the genre didn't exist yet, of course, and nobody acts like the camera is there), especially since it's inter-cut with interviews with the characters involved at some point past the scope of the movie, where they somberly try to provide justifications and reflect back on that time. But each moment is surprisingly revealing, even when everyone struggles against each other and personalities clash, and that's before they even begin to spass.\n\nIt's those sequences that really define the emotional moments of the film, and do so with a sympathy that leads one to even go so far as to understand why these people are doing the things they do. There's one sequence where one of the members, spassing, is left by the normal-presenting leader of the group, Stoffer (Jens Albinus), in the care of some violent biker guys, a test of sorts to see if he can keep up the facade under threat of potential violence if these guys feel they're being put on. But people's reactions to the disabled are often heartbreakingly humane, as these rough and tumble guys instantly go into caretaker mode, even going so far as to bring him into the bathroom when they decide he needs to go, one of the men holding the spasser's penis for him. It is at the same time one of the most uncomfortably exploitative and infinitely sweet moments I've seen on film in some time, and it's that juxtaposition that really drives home most of the poignant images of The Idiots.\n\nStoffer is the group standout, as he's the only who organizes most of the group efforts but is also the one who seems most interested in the political uses. To him, the group is a statement against society, a way to act out against a culture that has become safe and coddled. If that's true, then what truer role could a human try to become than an idiot? He's also the one who seems the most angry, lashing out sometimes violently when he confronts people in the real world who don't immediately fold under the societal pressure to accommodate the disabled. Contrasted with Karen, who spends most of the time being the audience surrogate, tacitly disapproving of this way of life while still staying around, fascinated by it. By the time she feels comfortable letting go the first time, it becomes a transformitive act of beauty, this rather proper, closed off woman accessing this deep emotional well that move others in the group to tears.\n\nIt seems strange to call a movie with such a ridiculous premise nuanced, but I'm going to walk out on that limb. There's a lot about human nature, about the lies we tell ourselves and the roles we assume to hide away our pain, that The Idiots says in a way few movies ever try to communicate. It does it in incendiary ways, but I feel that's as much to jar people into recognizing themselves in this madness than it is to just shock and offend. Provocation is a tool with actual results, something that often gets forgotten in a world where trolls shock people for no other reason than the lulz. If von Trier is doing it for lulz, it's only after the pain and suffering clearly on display, deeply felt by a director who makes each film seem like a cry of anguish he can't express any other way. And for all the weird artifice of the spassers, there's real discussion there about how people treat the disabled, and what it means to act out in society on various levels and with increasing degrees of consequence.\n\nOf all the movies I've ever written about, this is absolutely the hardest to condone, much less recommend. But there's material of worth here, buried under the obvious objections, that make it all worthwhile. This is undoubtedly as divisive a film as von Trier has made to date, and with good reason, but I've already followed this rabbit hole this far and it not only doesn't feel out of place, but feels more humane and compassionate that most of von Trier's work. There's heart buried here, so long as you're willing to find it.\n\n2 Responses to Directed Viewing: Dogme 95 and \"The Idiots\"\n\nI've been interested in seeing this for ages, but never got around to it.

{"text":"Sunshine (2007) English Subtitled Review\n\nSo it's been a while since I done a review for movies, but after watching this one for a second time around, I really felt inspired to write it. Today I'll be writing about Sunshine. By director Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire. I'll be honest the first time I watched Sunshine, I really thought the movie was quite boring, until I recently received a copy while going through my friend's computer.\n\nSo the movie is a science fiction\/thriller. It follows these group of astronauts who are sent on a mission to save earth, by taking this shuttle \"Icarus II\", after a failed attempt in the past to revive the sun. Earth's last hope to save themselves, they build this massive nuclear bomb out of the last remaining materials existing on our planet. Based on the \"Big Bang\" theory, they decide to create an explosion large enough to produce a star within a star (Sun). Along the mission, these astronauts encounter a bunch of problems, after a long period living closely with each other. The movie truly shows human emotion at work, a fight breaks over the simplest thing like sending a video message back to loved ones. Which if you really follow the movie, you'll understand why. They also encounter the loss of their ecosystem, that generate their oxygen. After one of the crew members makes a disastrous calculation, that requires them to make a exterior repair to the ship, in which the captain sacrifices himself for the greater good. After the loss of their captain they found, distress signals from \"Icarus I\", which seemed almost impossible, since believed they were lost seven year ago. They make a decision to take the route to rendezvous with the original Icarus, which would increase their chances of success of the mission with an extra bomb.\n\nTheir judgment call proved to be ugly, They encounter many more situations such as losing crew members, a guilty suicide that ties to the first half of the movie. An old crew members death wish to everyone, after sabotaging Icarus II's mission.\n\nThe movie proves to have a lot of plot twist and some loose ends, but then it makes up for incredible acting, and tremendous soundtrack that makes you feel the emotions involved in some scenes. The plot seems to be building up to something since the very beginning, but with many plot twists. It ends up to slightly kill the movie, In my opinion. I think they should of stuck to the whole, its the typical end of the world plot, get to destination, draw straws to see who stays, detonate, and leave sorta deals.\n\nAside from all of it, I definitely still would recommend the movie to anyone who wishes to pass time. Its worth a watch, but I would recommend others before it. The soundtrack does make up for a lot of things through the movie.\n\nLoves: Truly enjoyed many of the actors attempt to deliver the screenplay, very diverse cast, great directing and great soundtrack.\n\nHates: Didn't really enjoy much of the plot twists, their whole attempt to isolate the character's emotions seemed good, but they should of put more memory elements to the plot. Such as childhood memories, flash backs, just to make the characters more human.\n\nAllen Han started in promotional work in brand placement right after high school, then moving onto venue promoting.

{"text":"Movies: Sticking to Their Guns\n\nIn the Old West -- anyway in the old westerns--morality and mechanics went gun-in-hand. Any showdown ended with the good guy proving his superiority over the bad guy via a double blast of dexterity and firepower. Few questioned why the better man should automatically be a faster, more accurate shot or why disputes had to be resolved by gunplay. That was just the way that, in national and movie mythology, the West was won.\n\nToday, when the western reposes in the Boot Hill of movie genres, and the acquisition of the West can be seen as a century-long act of aggression, serious films are more likely to question gun love than to celebrate it. In Aric Avelino's American Gun, a film shown at the Toronto Film Festival last week, the gun is seen as a virtual urban plague that ends young lives, sunders families and turns schools into maximum-security prisons. Andrew Niccol's Lord of War imagines that a Ukrainian-American named Yuri (Nicolas Cage) could rise through the arms-dealing underworld, Scarface-style, spreading the virulence around the globe. There's \"one firearm for every 12 people on the planet,\" Yuri says. \"The only question is, How do we arm the other 11?\"\n\nAmerican gun love has long preoccupied and puzzled foreigners. So it's appropriate that an all-fired-up allegory on the subject, Dear Wendy, should come from perennial bad boy Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves), who wrote the film, and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Thomas Vinterberg (The Celebration), who directed. Set in a nameless U.S. town, the movie is framed as a letter written by a pensive idealist named Dick (Jamie Bell) to the love of his life--a handgun. Dick, who abhors violence but is fascinated by the workings and personalities of firearms, has gathered a few like-minded loners into a group of \"pacifists with guns.\" This heavy-artillery youth club, situated in a mine shaft, has all manner of arcane rules, including that the weapons must never be fired outside the club. That'll change.\n\nVon Trier has a tendency to go overboard in his denunciations of American violence (Dogville). By contrast, Dear Wendy is a cogent, comprehensive take on the land and the films that obsess him. In his upended western plot, these nice kids are inventing villains, reacting to outside threats that don't exist. By the end, the political implications are clear: the U.S. sees itself as the lonesome marshal--Gary Cooper in High Noon--when in fact it possesses the world's biggest arsenal and is making more trouble than it's preventing. Or not. But you needn't agree with this dour vision to find Dear Wendy a potent fable about America's history of violence."}
{"text":"Tag Archives: in bruges\n\nMarty (Colin Farrell) is a screenwriter with writer's block. However, when his best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) kidnaps a gangster's beloved Shih Tzu, Marty becomes involved and gets more inspiration than he was hoping for.\n\n2008\u2032s In Bruges was somewhat of a cult hit, so when writer Martin McDonagh returned with Seven Psychopaths, there was a fair bit of anticipation. Whilst it doesn't quite live up to the aforementioned Belgium-based rib tickler, Seven Psychopaths still has a lot going for it, particularly its witty script and some excellent performances. Rockwell and Christopher Walken especially give top-notch performances and steal pretty much every scene they're in. Farrell also seems much more at home in this type of thing than straight up action films.\n\nThe story is somewhat scatterbrain with characters and plot threads jumping here, there and everywhere (a metaphor for scriptwriting and writer's block?), but the interesting characters and sometimes hilarious dialogue keep it glued together. It is a brilliant script that has huge amounts to dwell upon once the credits roll and is a film that almost demands a second viewing. It's also full of self-referential moments that tread the line of clever and covering up for the odd occasion of lazy writing, but it's nowhere near enough to spoil what is a worthy follow up to McDonagh's debut, even if it doesn't quite hit the same high notes."}

{"text":"So I thought I'd kick my contribution off on our brand new review blog by talking about an old classic, namely Michael Bay's 2009 seminal masterpiece, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen. But then I decided to dig a little deeper, and instead discuss the 1953 classic Rashomon, from Japanese directing legend Akira Kurosawa. Why the switch, you ask? Well, I'll leave the intellectual philosophising of what robot balls are trying to say about modern society to someone more intelligent than me.\n\nRashomon is the third classic masterpiece that I've had the fortune of seeing this year (the other two being David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia, and Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times). Now whilst I am excited when I begin a movie I've heard so much about, I can't help but always have a level of trepidation as to whether the aspects that made any given movie a classic can be seen only by those who go into it with a fresh mind. In the case of Rashomon, the movie is commonly known for pioneering the technique of telling the same story through different angles, illustrating the unreliability of witnesses, among other things. As someone going into the movie for the first time, I can see how such a technique would be mindblowing and show how firm a grip the director has on the unfolding story; however, my concern was whether the movie had enough for someone like me, who was well aware, and in fact expecting, this technique to be used. And like the other two classics, I foudn the cinema had much more to offer than just pioneering the multiple perspective technique.\n\nThe movie begins in the middle of a massive rainstorm, from which a man seeks refuge in a temple. Along with shelter from the storm, the man finds a priest and a woodcutter sitting despondently, both of whom are saying they've heard a story so strange it has shaken their faith in humanity. After some prodding, the priest and woodcutter both tell a story of a murder that happened in the woods, and how the three tales told (by the three participants) all paint very different pictures of what actually happened. Of course, the newcomer, being perceptive among other things, eventually determines a fourth source for the story, one that gives us possibly the only accurate account of what happened (though possibly not). As the rain subsides, the cries of an abandoned baby are heard from within the temple, and the reaction of the three men to this sight really speaks of their true nature, regardless of their words and actions up to this point.\n\nDespite the murder mystery seemingly at the centre of it, I did not see this movie as a whodunit. Indeed, the question of how the person died was, in my mind, about as relevant as the question of why Hans Gruber chooses the Nakatomi building to steal from in Die Hard; that is to say, it is the catalyst for the film's events, but not an important factor in the final product. Rather, Rashomon is an examination of humanity, and the heights and depths that it is capable of. The fact that the narration occurs in a temple is not insignificant; the three men can be seen as otherworldly figures looking down at Earth. The way I interpreted it was that the priest was good (as evidenced by his clearly shaken faith in humanity, as well as his desire to comfort the baby upon finding it), the newcomer was evil (as evidenced by his cynicism, as well as his desire to steal the kimono upon finding the baby) and the woodcutter was humanity's representative in this cosmic debate on the true nature of people. The baby could, likewise, be seen as Earth itself, being entrusted to the care of humans at the end, while the rain was indecision, opaqueness, an inability to see true mankind, in whatever form it may be.\n\nWhich is not to say that the story of the three participants of the murder (the thief, the woman, and the dead husband) is any less an exploration of the faults of humanity. Kurosawa very excellently uses the multiple perspectives not simply as a flashy gimmick, but a tool to display the lies people tell to manipulate their image to outsiders, and the lack of innocence and true faultlessness. Not even the murdered man, telling his tale through a medium, turns out to be guilt-free in the whole affair, and the entire story, once seen from all four perspectives (as the newcomer accurately determines, the woodcutter was a silent witness to the entire affair) does leave one with a sinking feeling in their stomach, because if this is how humans behave in the absence of crowds, then what hope is there for the population at large? The period when this came out, less than 10 years after the dual atomic bombs Japan had dropped on them by the US in WW2, is significant in understanding where this seemingly bleak outlook that Kurosawa adopts comes from, but not in grasping the outlook itself, as the relevance of this exploration has not been lessened by time.\n\nOne thing Kurosawa does not offer here is any easy answers. The murder, and the rape that precedes it, seem to be, when all is said and done, senseless acts of violence that don't accomplish anything in the end, and no attempt is made on Kurosawa's end to change that. The viewers are left to draw their own understanding of why such a thing happened, whether it can happen again, and what it says about people. Which is not to say that the ideas are not explored, quite the contrary. Many movies have posited some interesting ideas, only to abandon them after scratching the surface, but Rashomon stands out as a work that manages to allow the viewer to arrive at their own thoughts while fully exploring all the ideas and themes it initially set out to do.\n\nDespite the seeming despair in humanity that casts a shadow throughout the movie , the final message is one of hope, that despite such depths that humanity can fall to, it is inherently good. The aforementioned baby is handed by the priest to the woodcutter, who asks to raise the child despite having six of his own already, just as the skies clear and the rain ends. The message is clear; Good has not given up on mankind, and mankind should not stop doing good, no matter how much bad they may also do. And that is a message that transcends time.\n\nOverall, this movie that kept me glued to the screen during its entire runtime, and left me thinking about it long after it was over. The movie exceeded all the expectations I had of it from years of hearing its praises, and rightly deserves its classic status they"}

{"text":"berg\n\nAdolescence has been an evolving cultural concept since, arguably, the Industrial Revolution. Back then, people suddenly were able to build real wealth, creating a middle-class lifestyle that meant the young didn't have to be in a big hurry to be worked to death. They could travel a bit, try out different professions, and maybe even kiss\/fondle a few people before settling down.\n\nUnfortunately, enough leisure time to find one's identity also doubles as time for self-doubt. The concept of youthful angst was born, leading to the coming-of-age story, in which a young protagonist tries to figure out where he fits into the big picture. The whole point is that the kid takes a journey that helps him find meaning for himself in the corrupt world of his elders, providing a crystallizing revelation from which to launch his own adulthood.\n\nIn recent years, it seems like adolescence has evolved (or devolved, depending on your view). Young people no longer figure out their place in the world in their late teens or early 20s. A lot of people shuffle around, bitching about the parent culture well into their late 20s and beyond. Young 'uns might go through any number of false starts until they feel \"\" through a combination of peer pressure, experience and shame \"\" ready to become self-actualized beings.\n\nOur understanding of Roger Greenberg's world is first filtered through Florence (Greta Gerwig, \"The House of the Devil\"), who works as his brother Phillip's (Chris Messina, \"Julie & Julia\") assistant. Her days are spent floating around the sun-drenched spiritual wasteland that is Los Angeles, generally meeting other peoples' needs. At night, she attends hip events, sometimes going home with the hipsters she meets. Like the girl in the song, Florence doesn't know what love is; she only knows when someone wants her.\n\nWhen Phillip takes the family on vacation, Florence meets Roger, who has come directly from a psychiatric hospital to house-sit for his brother. Inexplicably, she is drawn to Roger, who is the troubled, prickly-pear sort whom pretty girls are invariably drawn to in movies. He is naturally drawn to Florence, but also knows that getting involved with her is going to be a big hassle that will drain his alone time standing around the house making pained expressions out the window.\n\nOn top of dealing with a nascent relationship with Florence, Roger also has to deal with the baggage he left behind in L.A. 15 years before. It seems he was in a semi-successful band with Ivan (Rhys Ifans, \"Pirate Radio\") and Beller (Mark Duplass, \"Humpday\"). When the group was offered a recording contract, Roger somehow screwed it up with his Larry David-style social skills, and the band fell apart. Roger left town, and the resentments have been festering ever since. There's also his ex-girlfriend, Beth (Jennifer Jason Leigh, \"Synecdoche, New York\"), and the rest of his former social circle to contend with, all of whom seem to have morphed into middle-aged, child-rearing teetotalers who look at him with a mix of pity and contempt.\n\nMost of the tension in \"Greenberg\" comes from Roger attempting to avoid engagement with anyone around him and his inability to stop picking at his social irritations and attendant emotional wounds. His painful back-and-forth with Florence, the wincing conversations with Ivan in which they ignore the elephant in the room, and his general manner are all extremely awkward.\n\nThe main question is whether or not Roger will actually learn something and take a step forward as a human being. The way this question is handled is the great success: We don't really know. Roger understands he would be happier if he could let the world in, but it's not clear whether he actually has the option to change. He may just be too habitually bitchy to eliminate the negative and accentuate the positive.\n\nIn a way, it's a question that applies to almost everyone, especially those under 30. With all the world's distractions, material excesses and paths to personal estrangement, the possibility of achieving the bildungsroman's crystallizing revelation has become remote, maybe nonexistent. \"\"Mike Robertson"}
{"text":"Friday, August 31, 2012\n\nThe Way DVD\n\nI'd recommend The Wayto anyone who is seeking answers, enlightenment, understanding, and isn't afraid to take a look at the tough questions in life: What am I moving towards? What am I running from? And why?\n\nI expected the movie to be about major religious conversion, but it's not. Actually, the movie only loosely touches on the religious and spiritual implications of the Camino and the many Christ-centered pilgrims who set out to make the trek each year. In a sense this makes the film more accessible to the masses (pun intended) instead of a good fit mainly for the Catholic parishioners in the pews.\n\nThe Way is a thought-provoking, humorous look at how a physical journey is every bit as much about a journey inward as it is about reaching a particular destination. Having read the book Hiking the Camino: 500 Miles with Jesus by Dave Pivonka, T.O.R., a while back, I was somewhat familiar with the ancient pilgrimage trail when I heard about this film.\n\nWhat I didn't realize ahead of time is that this movie is a family affair. Not to say it's the right choice for a family movie night if you have children under thirteen, it's not, but the rich heritage, tradition, and strong family bonds explored in the film seem best acted by those who really do have a father\/son relationship. The Wayis directed by Emilio Estevez, dedicated to his grandfather, and stars as the lead Martin Sheen, the director's own father (who was named at birth Ramon Gerard Estevez).\n\nThe film was shot in France and Spain, where the el Camino exists and still attracts millions of pilgrims. The cinematography is quite beautiful which is immediately evident to the viewer even if the main character in the film neglects to take notice of or slow down to appreciate it.\n\nFour very different people from different countries, professions, and with widely varying reasons for hiking the Camino end up bonding as they each strive to overcome the challenges of the trail, which often prove to be more obvious and less treacherous than the emotional minefields within themselves.\n\nThe special features and behind-the-scenes definitely enhanced my appreciation for the movie and the collaborative effort in making it as well as going cross-country on a bus tour to promote it"}
{"text":"PAnews.com, Port Arthur, Texas\n\nFebruary 1, 2012\n\n'Man on Ledge' starts strong, plummets into mediocrity\n\nSean McBride The Port Arthur News\n\n\u2014\nThe new thriller, \"Man on a Ledge\" starts off at a brisk pace, offers up an intriguing mystery and gets the tension going early so that the audience is quickly sitting on the edge of their seats. It's a great start, but unfortunately, all these good elements fall by the wayside as the film lurches toward its ludicrous, coincidence-filled finale. In movie math, film endings are more important that their beginnings, so the final assessment is that \"Man on a Ledge\" is ultimately just another mediocre crime thriller.\n\nSam Worthington stars as Nick Cassidy, a disgraced police officer now serving a 25 year sentence for a crime that he claims he didn't commit. Nick breaks out of prison, checks into the Roosevelt hotel and orders something to eat. Then he takes a deep breath and steps out onto the window ledge some twenty stories above street level. It's not long before a crowd gathers to watch the obviously suicidal man and a police negotiator (Elizabeth Banks) is sent to try and talk the man down.\n\nIf you've seen the TV commercials, you know that Nick isn't contemplating suicide as much as he's trying to stage a diversion for a daring scheme. It turns out that just across the street, Nick's brother (Jamie Bell) and his girlfriend (Genesis Rodriguez) are breaking in to an ultra-secure vault. They are looking for the diamond that Nick supposedly stole. If they find it, they can prove Nick's innocence as well as extract a little payback on the guy who put Nick behind bars.\n\nIt's a convoluted plot, which is to be expected in a film that's equal parts mystery and crime thriller. It's also something of a character study, as we learn little bits and pieces about why our hero is out on the ledge, as well as the backstory behind the police negotiator. The problem is that while these disparate elements are intriguing in their own right, they don't quite gel into one cohesive story. You'll leave the theater thinking about the implausible ways that the film was forced to wrap up, instead of how much fun you had watching the thriller.\n\nThat's a shame, because the film is a lot of fun. Sam Worthington makes a great, everyman character. Kyra Sedgwick also amuses as a decidedly not-Latino reporter. Playing the bad guy, Ed Harris, while a little over-the-top for my personal tastes, is always an engaging presence up on the big screen. The bottom line is that there is a lot that goes right in \"Man on a Ledge.\" It's the ending that slips and sends the whole endeavor crashing down to earth."}

{"text":"The Silence of the Lambs\n\nRate this movie:\n\nYou must sign-in first.\n\nCurrent Rating 9.32\/10 | 91 Votes\n\nI saw this movie exactly ten years after it was released and now I finally understand why so many people call it a masterpiece. Everything in this film is great, story, acting, direction and it keeps you so focused -nearly hypnotized- on it that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen for a second.\n\nClarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is an FBI trainee who's asigned to talk to a psychopath prisoner, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in order to get information that might help finding a serial killer known as 'Buffalo Bill', who kidnaps women, starves them for a couple of days and then removes part of their skin. Dr. Lecter was a famous psychiatrist before he started killing people and became Hannibal the Cannibal, nickname what was given to him because instead of skinning his victims as Buffalo Bill does, he ate them. Lecter is going to help Clarice find Buffalo Bill but he wants to be transfered to another prison where he has a view to trees and stuff like that, in his current prison he's completely isolated from everything.\n\nThe story is much more complex than that but if you want to know what happens you're gonna have to watch the film, I wont spoil it for you in here.\n\nThe Lecter character was portrayed so wonderfully by Hopkins that through the film you get to sympathise with him and forget how evil he really is. He treats Clarice with such charm it's even hard to believe this man used to eat people. Lecter is much smarter than the average people, he could tell you a lot of details about your life just by looking at you, and he's an excellent mind manipulator. That's basically what made the film so great in my opinion, the Lecter character. His calmed tone of voice and the way he says 'Clarice' at the end of every sentence he says to Clarice is terrifying, now everytime I'm in a silent place I start hearing \"Good evening, Clarice\". Hopkins doesn't have such a scary appearance, it's his facial expression and his metalic voice that make him look frightening.\n\nThere are no words to describe how good the acting was in this film, Sir Anthony Hopkins was just unbelievably good and Jodie Foster gave the best performance of her career, they both won an Academy Award for their flawless performances. On the supporting side Ted Levine and Scott Glenn were pretty good also. Direction by Jonathan Demme was great too, he also got an Oscar. Ted Tally got an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. It'd be no surprise by now to say the film also got the Best Picture Oscar.\n\nThe thing that I liked most, and I think most people really liked too, is the cinematography. While Lecter and Clarice are having their conversations, Lecter's face it's often shown from a very close angle, his face fills up the whole screen in this occasions and that by itself is truly scary. The film has some blood but it's not as gory as it's sequel, which is totally understandable since it wasn't really needed. This film is a masterpiece and it shouldn't be missed by anyone, it'll have you thinking about it for sometime after you see it."}
{"text":"CAPSULE: RATATOUILLE has an engaging enough premise,\nbut does not really have a good story to tell. The\nfirst third of the film is much more engaging than\nthe remainder. The furry rat who is the main\ncharacter is expressive and winning, but the human\ncharacters do not give him much support and the story\npulls in too many directions. Rating: high +1\n(-4 to +4) or 6\/10\n\nRemy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) was born with a taste for the\nfiner things in life. He knows food and not only has a highly\ncultured palette; he has a supernatural talent for cooking French\nhaute cuisine. You can just tell that Remy is headed for a lot\nof frustration since he is, after all, a rat, and kitchens are\noff limits to rats. Most people who see a rat in a kitchen\nimmediately go after it with a cleaver or sometimes a shotgun.\nRemy's chances of ever getting to test his talents in a kitchen\nseem small, but hey, this is a cartoon. A chain of events chases\nRemy away from a farmhouse kitchen and washes him into a storm\ndrain and out again. He finds himself in the center of Paris and\nat the very foundation of the restaurant founded by Remy's hero,\nthe famous Chef Gusteau. But Remy still has to overcome the\nwhole rat-in-a-kitchen problem. Luckily the garbage boy at\nGusteau's discovers Remy. Linguini (Lou Romano) has been hired\nreluctantly by the tyrannical Chef Skinner (Ian Holm) on the\nspecific proviso that Linguini never tries to cook. But Remy can\ncook using Linguini as his hands.\n\nThe story of RATATOUILLE is a good cut beneath previous\nPixar\/Disney animation films. It almost feels as though whenever\nwriter\/director Brad Bird could not figure out how to make the\nplot work, he added a contrivance or a coincidence to push the\nplot along. Remy idolizes Chef Gusteau and a flood and a storm\ndrain contrive to deposit him in Paris exactly at the chef's\nrestaurant. How can a rat silently direct Linguini's cooking?\nWell, it just turns out that Linguini has a peculiar muscular\nreflex that no other human has ever had, but it turns out to be\njust precisely what Remy needs to run the show. At various\npoints various people know that Gusteau's restaurant has what\nappears to be a rat problem. Only one person does anything about\nit, and that is unrealistically insufficient. Yet Gusteau's\nRestaurant's fine reputation is never damaged. This is a film\nthat has too many bad guys doing too many different things. The\nbad chef is victimizing Linguini while the bad critic is\nvictimizing the restaurant. A villain is vanquished two-thirds\nthe way into the film in what seems like a big climax, but he\nstill hangs around threateningly without doing very much. There\nis a romance, but neither the boy nor the girl is particularly\nlikable.\n\nA film like this needs a nice well-defined plot. FINDING NEMO, a\nprevious Pixar\/Disney film, had a clear, clean plot. Nemo is\ntaken and the film is about the how Nemo is rescued. RATATOUILLE\ndoes not have such a clear plot. Remy wants to cook and eat what\nhe cooks. Linguini is not sure what he wants other than to hold\nonto his job and get the girl. Chef Skinner is nasty and may\nwant to be rid of Linguini, but his chief goal does not clearly\nconnect with the main characters. The villainous, egotistical\ncritic just wants people to know where to get good food and is\nwilling to be a little sarcastic along the way. That actually\nshould help Linguini and Remy, not threaten them.\n\nRATATOUILLE is funny and imaginative. I will not say the\nanimation is great, not because it isn't, but because *every*\nPixar film has great animation and breaks new ground. The visual\nelement is very fine, but the script was frequently unsatisfying.\nOn balance it is a good film and I rate it a high +1 on the -4 to\n+4 scale or 6\/10. As is becoming the custom with animated\nreleases, RATATOUILLE comes packaged with a supporting cartoon.\nIn this case it is \"Lifted\", in which an incompetent teenager-\nlike alien tries to abduct a human with a levitation beam. It\nwas funny enough, though younger children in the audience were\nasking why aliens would kidnap humans, and come to think of it so\nwas I."}

It doesn't help either that sometimes it's impossible to understand what the characters are saying. It almost feels like there should be subtitles down the bottom. Basically, as far as I can tell anyway, the story moves from one character to another and shows their involvement in the overall plot. Then at the end it tries to explain itself, but by then the audience is already so lost as to what's going on that it's pretty pointless anyway. It also seemed as if the writers really believed that massive shootouts in the middle of the city still happened every 5 minutes and that no one took any notice as if it was an everyday occurrence. It really seemed as if they believed those scenes to actually be possible in todays world.\n\nNot one that's going to be remembered as great by any stretch of the imagination.

{"text":"Email\n\nShare\n\nMore I Watched This On Purpose\n\nNo related Where to start? Caligula is the rare sort of film whose production seems more relevant to its storyline than its actual content. It's a monstrous, shambling wreck that infuriated its director and its screenwriter, thoroughly embarrassed its cast, and so appalled critic Roger Ebert that he was unable to sit through the entire two-and-a-half-hour running time. (He gave it zero stars anyway, calling it \"sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash\" in his review.) Most critics were equally dismissive. Bob Guccione, the recently deceased founder and publisher of Penthouse magazine, financed the film with little understanding or interest in how big-budget epics were actually shot, ultimately firing original director Tinto Brass and editing footage into a hash that removed what little sense may have originally existed in Gore Vidal's screenplay, and inserting hardcore sex scenes to spice up a movie already loaded with enough naked flesh to make David Duchovny blush. Wikipedia currently lists an astonishing nine different cuts of the film, including the 102-minute R-rated version, the 156-minute unrated version, and the horrifying-if-real 210-minute work print. Given its salacious content and infamous reputation, it's no surprise that Caligula has been released on home video and DVD multiple times; the only surprise would be if anyone watched it all the way through more than once.\n\nCuriosity factor: If reading the previous paragraph doesn't make you even a little interested in watching the movie, well, you're made of sterner stuff than I. A porno starring Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, and John Gielgud? Oh hell yeah. I was under no illusion that Caligula would be any good at all, and that 156-minute run time did make me nervous (yes, I went with the unrated cut; would you expect less?), but some movies persist in the cultural memory simply because they're so outrageous, we can't help but be delighted they're real. Oh of course it's trash, and of course it's filth and perversion and horse-fucking and girl-on-girl and Peter O'Toole being crazy and Malcolm McDowell fisting a dude and\u2014wait, what was I saying? Right. It's trash, but in concept at least, it has the potential of being gloriously transgressive trash.\n\nWarning: All of these clips are decidedly NSFW.\n\nThe viewing experience: Transgressive? Yeah, maybe, although not in any way that matters. Trash? Honestly, I'm uncomfortable with the moral component there. I've heard nothing of anyone being assaulted or brutalized over the course of filming that I could find, so \"trash\" is probably going a little far. It's stupid, but not hatefully stupid. Glorious? Er, no. Aside from some impressive pieces of set design and the occasional strong performance or striking shot, \"glorious\" doesn't fit here. \"Sleazy\" would be more appropriate\u2014and that's a moral-ish word I do feel comfortable using, because I'm pretty sure Guccione was aiming for it. Watching Caligula is like flipping back and forth between a prestigious but dull historical epic and a movie in which people masturbate a lot. The masturbation may be some kind of symbolism, but when you're watching actual genitalia onscreen\u2026 well, to paraphrase Freud, sometimes a dick is just a dick.\n\nIt's tempting to blame most of Caligula's flaws on Guccione's meddling, and there's little doubt that his additions\u2014including, most infamously, a five-minute lesbian sex scene that doesn't have anything to do with anything beyond being a five-minute lesbian sex scene\u2014were distracting, pointless, and, by the end, irritatingly dull. During a late-movie orgy sequence, I'd swear I saw the same woman giving the same guy the same blowjob at least six times. Apart from ruining any sense of narrative momentum, the constant assault of fuckery just gets old. It starts as shocking, becomes compelling in a Rube-Goldberg-meets-the-Marquis-De-Sade kind of way, but by the time you hit your third finger-bang, the magic is gone.\n\nEven stripped of its sexual content, though, this would be a slog, though admittedly a much shorter one. Again, much of the problem can be laid at Guccione's feet. His influence in the editing room changed the order of some scenes, which probably didn't much help the story's attempts at rising action, not to mention scene-to-scene continuity. Yet I can't help but wonder whether Vidal's screenplay and Bass's original vision would've been anything more than another by-the-numbers historical epic without the interference. There would have been nudity, and there would have been a quality cast, but as it now stands, this is an epic that mimics a standard rise-and-fall arc without ever generating any drama outside a few isolated moments. Obviously, it's impossible to judge what might have been, but this is fitfully intriguing at best.\n\nTake the plot: Malcolm McDowell plays Caligula, inveterate sister-fucker and heir to not-quite-dead Emperor Tiberius (Peter O'Toole). The movie opens with a familiar quote about gaining the world and losing one's soul, but let's be honest here: When your idea of a perfect day involves romping naked through the woods with a sibling, then screwing that sibling to your heart's content, the soul train has already left your particular station. Caligula and his sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy, who replaced Maria Schneider) form the closest thing to a positive, loving couple in the entire film, and something could've been done with that. As creepy as their situation is, at least this is a starting point of (incredibly comparative) wholesomeness.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no place to go from here, because there's no sense of anything important being lost once Caligula takes over Rome. Tiberius, who spends his days bathing, groping slaves, and hanging out in what looks like the hell set from The Apple, comments on what a bastard his heir is, and Tiberius' advisor, Nerva (John Geilgud) kills himself to avoid living under Caligula's reign. Maybe not everybody understands what's coming, but Caligula's rise to power and his instantaneous corruption seem like inevitable outcomes of his poisonous upbringing and his own built-in crazy. There's nothing wrong with that for a movie\u2014inevitability is one of the cornerstones of tragedy\u2014but aside from the spectacle, and the initial curiosity as to what the nutty bastard will come up with next, there's surprisingly little drama here. Caligula commits atrocities, anonymous attractive people grope each other, rinse, repeat. (Not kidding on the \"rinse\" part.)\n\nLate in the film, Drusilla catches a fever (probably from Caligula himself) and dies, and Caligula goes mad. Well, madder, I guess. He goes and hangs out with the common people, who mock him and his dead lover, and that bothers him somewhat. You can tell because he claims he's a god, and then he goes to war against Britain, even though they don't provide an army to fight against. He also declares himself the Pimp Of Rome, and we get the really, really big orgy scene that ties the other orgy scenes together thematically. My grasp of Roman history is limited to what I remember from Robert Graves' I, Claudius (Claudius shows up a few times here, but is never anything but a joke), but much of this seems familiar; what's odd is that here, the story seems almost sympathetic to the strutting, venomous creep. We see most of the movie through his perspective, and he's largely opaque, doing ugly things one scene, rending clothes and mourning his sister the next. Apart from the personality-free victims of his atrocities, none of the people in the film distinguish themselves as worthy of our admiration or emotional investment. So who cares?\n\nBut hey, what about that cast? Nobody winces on camera, and they all manage to escape with their dignity intact, which is the most anyone could hope for. Performance-wise, McDowell is just doing a less charismatic version of Alex from A Clockwork Orange, and Gielgud's role barely qualifies as a cameo. Helen Mirren does what she can with what she's given, which is mostly just hanging out and occasionally getting naked. (Her expression of bored contempt when McDowell mounts her from behind during their first sex scene is great.) About the only one to really make an impression is O'Toole. Glowering through a face full of sores, he is gleefully decadent and vile, and when he dies, he takes with him the only thing that could've saved the movie: a sense of humor.\n\nHow much of the experience wasn't a total waste of time: Because I refuse to believe that anything with a naked Helen Mirren in it could be completely worthless, I'll say 30 percent. It's worth seeing as sort of bragging-rights viewing experience, although viewers with weak stomachs are advised to look elsewhere. As a reenactment of history, Caligula is too scattershot to be much use; as entertainment, it's a drag; and as pornography\u2014well, a person can only take so much in one sitting."}

We'd drive to set each morning with the sun coming up over the cane fields and mount warning in the distance, it was just really, really special.\n\nTell us a little bit about your character, Rhia:\n\nEmily Barclay: Rhia is 27, she has three kids, the eldest of whom, Lou, is 11. Her partner has recently left her, she's I trouble financially and she's just struggling to stay afloat.\n\nHow did you prepare for your role?\n\nEmily Barclay: I don't know - I mean I read the script a million times, I researched various things, I wrote a lot, I talked a lot to Belinda, rehearsed with the girls.. I guess it's a bunch of things, the character is in your head constantly and everything you see and experience you kinda relate back to them, you pick up this and that...\n\nWhat was the hardest thing about playing a mother in this film?\n\nEmily Barclay: I think often Rhia feels like she doesn't know how to be a mother, there's this gap between the ideology of it all and her reality, like nothing quite fits or feels right, and I felt that at times - not quite knowing exactly what to do or exactly how to be with the kids, but I guess those feelings were relevant, and maybe it was just the lines of reality blurring haha.\n\nLily Bell-Tindley, who plays Lou is quite young, can you tell us a little bit about the filming process for the movie?\n\nEmily Barclay: Lily is incredible. She's so smart and fun and mature - just such a beautiful person, it was such a joy working with her. And she was so excited about it all and so eager to learn everything and that attitude is infectious -the fact that Lily was there everyday influenced the rest of the cast and crew and made it such an enjoyable experience.\n\nObviously there are certain restrictions when you have three kids on set all the time - days are shorter so somedays you can feel a little pressed for time, but everyone was very supportive and respectful of the kids and the focus was on them which was great.\n\nWhy will this film appeal to Australian audiences?\n\nEmily Barclay: I think it's such a sweet, tender story, it feels like an Australia that we don't really see on film, while still being a story that we can all recognise and relate to on some level.\n\nIf you could star alongside any actor, who would it be?\n\nEmily Barclay: I don't know! There's so many amazing actors... working with John Hurt was something I never thought would happen, I don't know if it gets much better than that!\n\nWhat's next for you, in regards to acting?\n\nEmily Barclay: I just finished a film in New Zealand called Love Birds with Sally Hawkins and Rhys Darby and I'm currently finishing Guardians of Ga'hoole which is an animated film being directed by Zach Snyder."}
{"text":"He repairs almost anything, including irreparably damaged relationships. But this film about damaged lives needs no repairing. My Name Is Khan is a flawless work, as perfect in content, tone and treatment as any film can get. The 'message' of humanism doesn't comes across in long pedantic speeches.\n\nThe film's longest monologue has our damaged but exceptionally coherent hero Rizwan telling a congregation of Black American church-goers about his dead son.\n\nAnd if that moment moves us to tears it's because the emotions are neither manipulative nor flamboyant. It isn't because Rizwan's son Sameer perished in a racial attack. It isn't even because Shah Rukh Khan delivers his life's best performance in that moment of reckoning. Rizwan's heartfelt rhetoric is not about changing the world with words. Born with a physical disability this is a man on the move. And boy, does he move!\n\nIn what is possibly the most touching testament on film to the spirit of world peace and humanism (lofty ideals to achieve in the massy-masala format but see how pitch-perfect Johar gets it) Rizwan takes off on a picturesque journey to meet the US President with a message that initially strikes us as being too naive for reiteration.\n\nBut look closer. Some of life's basic values have been lost in recent times. Writer Shibani Bathija's seamless screenplay, arguably the best piece of writing since Rakeysh Mehra's Rang De Basanti, recovers that long-lost message of loving your fellow human being unconditionally without getting trite around the edges.\n\nSex and politics have nothing to do with it. It's okay to hug your neighbours.\n\nFirst and foremost My Name Is Khan is a wonderful story told with a flair and flourish that leave a lingering impact on the viewer. Almost every frame is composed with a mix of mind and heart creating an irresistible progression of moments so tender and forcible we're simply swept away in the tides of the tale about a very special man who undertakes a very special journey.\n\nMy Names Is Khan opens with Rizwan boarding an American flight being frisked after a suspicious co-passenger hears him chanting religious passages. Before we begin to suspect this to be one more film on the persecution of the innocent Muslim, Karan Johar doing a smart and slick spin away from his trademark content and style, takes his hero on a journey that crosses several emotional, political and geographical borders before stopping with breathless integrity to say, life doesn't go on...it changes colours and textures with the moral values that the individual chooses to confer on the life given to him.\n\nSuperbly scripted by Bathija with pithy outstanding dialogues by Niranjan Iyenger, the film is edited by Deepa Bhatia with just that much amount of time allotted to the character's and their thought processes to make them appear warm humane and tangible without over-punctuating their presence.\n\nMy Name Is Khan To take one example , when Rizwan brother (Jimmy Shergil, making the best of his brief but comprehensive role) quietly tells his lovely wife (Sonia Jehan) to not wear her veil to work in the US because God would understand, the scene with beautiful economy conveys the couple's mutual empathy and determination to override the hatred outside their home.\n\nKaran Johar always a master of overstatement, for once holds back. The silences in My Name Is Khan often speak far more eloquently than the spoken words. The relationships that the inarticulate Rizwan forms during the course of his life from child to husband to father to a political individual are contoured with a luminous lack of laboriousness. Whether it's young Rizwan (played sensitively by Tanay Cheda) and his mother (Zarina Wahab, memorable in her brief appearance) or much later, Rizwan and his step-son (brilliant young discovery Yuvaan Makar) the traditional relationships are done-up in striking but subtle shades. We look at every moment in the film (even the clumsily-done flood sequences) as special because they are part of vision that goes far beyond the real of hop-in-hop-out entertainment.\n\nThe director swerves out of his comfort zone without the sound of screechy wheels . Karan Johar's unconventional take on modern marital mores in Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna faltered due to over-statement. In Khan he doesn't try hard. The characters and their predicament as America gets increasingly suspicious and hostile about the Muslim presence, are portrayed with a lightness of touch that lights up almost every sequence.\n\nThen there is Kajol to provide the kind of natural light to every frame that no amount of artificial light can supplement. As Rizwan's Hindu wife Mandira with a smart intelligent son she has a distinctly secondary role to Shah Rukh Khan. She leaves a lasting impact as a divorcee and later an angry wife and grieving mother, as only Kajol can.\n\nThe scenes of courtship between Mandira and Rizwan work so beautifully because of the exceptional chemistry between the two actors. More than a strong political statement and moving message of peace My Name Is Khan is a love story of a man who can't express his love through words, only deeds. This is a film that Frank Capra would've made if he had lived long enough to see 9\/11 happen.\n\nThe narration is carpeted with virtues, both invisible and visible. Ravi K Chandran's cinematography captures the incandescent soul of the pure-hearted protagonist as effectively as the stubbornly unbroken spirit of unknown passersby on the streets of America.\n\nRizwan, we are told, is petrified of the yellow colour. The offending colour recurs with just a hint of insistence. Rizwan wears shocking pink because he hears Mandira's buddy (Navneet Nishan) say it suits her. He proposes marriage and sex (in that order) at the most inopportune moments. He suggests Mandira have her dinner when she's traumatized by grief. He wears his dead son's shoes as he takes off to meet the President. Rizwan moves by his clock. But his tale is timeless.\n\nShah Rukh Khan doesn't PLAY Rizwan.

Undoubtedly this is Shah Rukh's best performance ever.\n\nThis is no ordinary hero. And"}

{"text":"Fight Club\n\nSynopsis\n\nHow much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?Chuck Palahniuk's novel Fight Club is a stunning piece of literary fiction. When I first read it I was blown away by the narrative voice present, laden with fierce and bleak language with an undertone of unchecked rage towards a society focussed on individualism and consumerism. Capturing all that is one thing, but also managing to mould all this into a plot that is filled with twists and turns and is perfectly paced without getting lost in all its ideas, well, that is something else altogether. Now to say I was sceptical when I read that a film was going to be made out of this book is a huge understatement. I was convinced that they would fail, even Fincher\u2026\n\n\"Listen to me!

{"text":"Reviews\n\nOrphan\n\nIt's hard to understand why some people just don't enjoy a movie you enjoy, Orphan is one of the more recent movies to get highly divided views and it's sad since there is a good film here. The DVD is ridiculous, especially if you're renting, but the story is enough that you should more than check it out and see if it appeals to you.\n\nKate (Vera Farmiga) is coping with the death of her stillborn daughter and a depression that drove her to alcoholism, endangering other daughter in the process. Eventually her and her supportive husband John (Peter Sarsgaard) decide to adopt an older child, and that's where they meet Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). Esther dresses differently, talks with a Russian accent, and forms a close relationship with her new little sister Max (Aryana Engineer) who is deaf. When people start getting hurt in bizarre accidents, especially those who Esther doesn't like, Kate starts to think something is wrong but face opposition from those who think she's merely crawling back into the bottle.\n\nThere's a lot of layers to this movie, considering on the surface it's supposed to be your typical evil-kid film. Yes Esther is evil, but the movie takes a lot of different horror movie conventions and adds some real heart and depth to them. Kate and John are a genuinely loving couple who have suffered a terrible loss. That could have been the only factor but we get in glimpses and dialogue that Kate turned to drinking and almost killed Max while drunk. It allows the audience to connect with Kate and realize some people don't bounce back like movies show. The other unique factor is little Max, a role beautifully played by the adorable Aryana Engineer. Max could have been the sweet, innocent girl who is trapped under Esther's spell, but director Jaume Collet-Serra takes things a different route by making Max deaf. Engineer herself is deaf and she expertly conveys so much emotion with no words. The way she turns her body or just looks at her family, conveys twenty times more emotion and fright than any dialogue. Hopefully this little girl goes on to act more because she is a fantastic talent. As evidenced, the family is already hanging by a thread, and Esther is merely the push that gets everything rolling. This isn't to say the evil-kid story doesn't work, but it seems more than it usually is by taking into account the family's history. Isabelle Fuhrman is solid as Esther, the only issue is these types of characters have limited range, merely being cute and menacing.\n\nOrphan is far from perfect and that's due to it being a rehash of every other movie in this genre. Peter Sarsgaard and Jimmy Bennett are mainly used to round out the family. Sarsgaard is necessary for the plot but he seems very wooden, it's evident this isn't his strongest acting to date. His character is also extremely forgiving, making him look a bit creepier than he should be. Bennett just does his usual schtick of whimpering and trying to be the tough older brother. In terms of story there is a lot of plot issues, mainly involving how obvious Esther becomes and yet no one believes her of being a killer. Kate herself does a lot of things that are immediately thrown aside as being the ramblings of a drunk, this is highly ridiculous in a scene in the hospital where she's forced under sedation. In re-watching this after seeing it in theaters, the twist that leads into the ending will either interest you or repel you. If you watch Law and Order: Special Victims Unit the ending will seem ripped from that series, and irritate you. The movie also seems to end twice, once with a straight-forward ending, and then a prolonged fight scene that seems unnecessary.\n\nThere's supposed to be deleted scenes on the standard DVD but my rental copy had nothing so it might purely be a buy feature. That's apparently all that's on the DVD, four deleted scenes. The Blu-Ray has the scenes and a featurette, again nothing too compelling to get you to buy. A gripe is that the movie has about twenty previews before the movie, and unfortunately the only way to pass these is to fast-forward (you're unable to hit menu or use the skip feature). Considering there's no added material it's irritating that the previews can't be skipped.\n\nOverall, Orphan is good, nothing more or less. There's plot gaps and some overacting but nothing that you won't find fun if you're a horror buff. Collett-Serra doesn't pander to typical horror conventions and adds some true complexities to the family so even if you're not a horror fan, you can still enjoy the family fighting against evil. The DVD is pointless so rent if you're a first-timer and only buy if you think you'll watch this more than once. The movie gets a 3\/5 and the DVD gets a 1.5\/5."}

Every now and then she needs to feed on the local peasants that her creepy brother (Sam Spruell) brings to the castle. She literally sucks the life out of them.\n\nA small price to pay to keep looking that fabulous.\n\nBut the years have worn on the killer queen.

But then Snow escapes, running into the Dark Woods where the queen's power holds no sway. The queen hires a huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to track the runaway down. But he falls for Snow, not the queen. Weird.\n\nFirst-time director Rupert Sander assembles an excellent production team. Colleen Atwood's costumes have a cool, decadent feel, most notably with the queen's oil spill dress that drips black feathers. The art direction adds to this feeling of unnaturalness. However, as a director Sander tends to play the scenes out too straight. The script by Evan Daugherty is too on point with characters saying exactly what they feel and not much else. This is more of a makeover of the familiar tale, and less of a different take.\n\nEven the famed seven dwarfs (plus one!) aren't much more than a guessing game of name the actor\u2014Ian McShane and Nick Frost are the standouts.\n\nStill, Theron is a delight.

It's just as meaningful, inspiring and enlightening now as it was back in 1940, when it was released as Chaplin's first all-talking, all-sound picture. Chaplin financed the entire film himself, and it was his biggest box office hit, grossing around $5 million.\n\nA tiny bit of trivia: Adolf Hitler banned The Great Dictator from Germany, but curiosity eventually got the best of him and he snuck a copy into the country.

{"text":"Movie Review: City of Ember\n\nCity of Ember is the sort of movie I would have worshipped as a kid. Its unique style and emphasis on discovery help it fit right in with Flight of the Navigator, The Goonies, and the countless other adventures that comprised my cinematic diet back in the day. At the risk of sounding like a crotchety old-timer, they just don't make movies like this anymore, truly riveting tales all too often pushed to the side in favor of something heavy on the lame-brained pratfalls. It may not be the \"be all, end all\" of family pictures, but City of Ember has a lot more going for it than a good chunk of the material usually aimed at the grade-school set.\n\nOnce upon a time, a catastrophic disaster forced a fraction of mankind to retreat into an underground city called Ember. A box was entrusted to the city's mayors, a box that would open in 200 years and provide instructions on what to do next. But those two centuries have passed, and the box has long since been lost to the sands of time. It's especially unfortunate, since the generator keeping Ember surging with power is beginning to fail, and various sections of the city are crumbling apart as well. With a lame-duck mayor (Bill Murray) who assures the people of Ember that everything's under control, the task of figuring out how to save the city falls into the hands of two children. Lina (Saoirse Ronan), a rambunctious girl who uncovers the forgotten box, joins forces with stalwart pipe worker Doon (Harry Treadaway) in order to defy the mayor and escape Ember before it's too late.\n\nCity of Ember opened in the fall of 2008 to a rather chilly reception, especially financially speaking. It was easily overshadowed by the likes of High School Musical 3 and Beverly Hills Chihuahua, though heaven knows why. This film has more spark (pardon the pun) in one frame than those two did in their entireties, but for some reason, kids didn't respond that well. Perhaps it was too retro-looking for their tastes, too offbeat and risky to dive into right off the bat. But if being original and creative (in an era when Hollywood's annual output indicates that it's anything but) is a crime, then consider City of Ember guilty as charged. It's the first movie I've seen in many an age that immerses you in such a fantastic, complex world with seemingly little effort. Though director Gil Kenan (Monster House) firmly establishes that Ember isn't that great of a place to live, I still felt like diving through the screen and exploring the city on my own. It's a veritable labyrinth, packed with all sorts of gadgets, gizmos, mazelike corridors, and lights as far as the eye can see. Kenan does a masterful job of not only bringing Ember to life but ensuring that you don't forget it too soon"}

{"text":"Thursday, August 19, 2010\n\nAn actress' true essence is in her expression of emotion. The way she portrays the feelings of a character by a movement or a facial expression. The art of letting the audience feel the emotion without words. Michelle has proven to be a master in this several times. I'm sure Michelle's performances have made a lot of people cry. And even though I can't cry at movies myself, these moments were heartbreaking.I am Sam.It's always a surprise when you suddenly see a soft character getting a backbone. But it's an even bigger shock when you see a cold character getting feelings. And Michelle did it perfectly. Her emotional break-down towards Sam swept people away. That cold edge around Michelle's character suddenly melts away and makes room for this blurt of emotion. If that's not heartbreaking, what is?\n\nThe deep end of the ocean. I'm not a mother, so I can only imagine how it must feel like. Losing your child is the worst thing that could happen to a mother. The moment when you see the crust of bread in Michelle's hand while she makes a face, just that look makes you feel empathy. And when she looks at her son's picture and starts to have an attack\u2026 You get such a mixture of feelings. Shock, understanding, pity. Now that I think of it, that movie is very underrated. As is Michelle's performance.\n\nCh\u00e9ri. The whole last hour of this movie is sad actually, but the last conversation between L\u00e9a and Ch\u00e9ri is the real tearjerker. The complexity of L\u00e9a all falls together in the end. The real sadness lies in the realization that L\u00e9a loves Ch\u00e9ri so much that she lets him go. And the way she says 'You found an old woman.' One simple sentence, said with so much emotion and remorse. It really overwhelmed me and I even got Goosebumps! Only she could do it that way. And talking about gripping looks. L\u00e9a's look in the mirror at the end expressed it all.\n\nThe age of innocence. I've been longing to do a review on this one, but I want to wait for the right moment; this movie means a lot to me. The heartbreak, obviously, rests in the way Ellen and Newland can't be together, even though it's obvious they belong together. Michelle's expressions and dialogue are what made Ellen. The way she resists the temptation and pretends the carelessness. Also, their chemistry is just right. The scene where Newland strips Ellen of her glove, followed by a passionate kiss, it just takes my breath away.\n\nFrankie and Johnny. My favorite Pfilm; real, honest, heartbreaking. Michelle portrays an unhappy woman with a strong shield around her heart. That is until the last part of the film. The last scene in which all her emotions come out is really heartbreaking. The heartbreak itself was short, because it does have a happy ending and it was so great to finally see her giving love another chance. But this movie wasn't about the ending, it was about the journey of the characters during the film.\n\nUp close and personal. From the moment you see Ned's face, you know there's something wrong. And when you see those boots, all you can do is scream, silently. But I don't find Michelle's crying and whispers in terror the saddest about this movie. The scene I find really touching is the very last scene. When she is going on stage to give a speech and sees her husband's picture on the screen. Her look there is indescribable. So is her speech, which she gives as she goes. \"My husband told me that, not so long ago.\" Just the way she said that. So sincere and warm, with a look that tells you more than a thousand words.\n\nWednesday, August 11, 2010\n\nWe all know Pfans aren't common. We're a very selected group of people divided in different parts of the world. I'm not talking about people who like her in a movie or two; I'm talking about the real deal Pfans to the bone. The people who spend their time writing Pfeiffer-blogs, surfing Pfeiffer-websites and discuss all sorts of Pfeiffer-stuff with other Pfans. But why is it that so few people are Pfans? I mean, Michelle's an A-class actress, there's no question about that. But still, most people prefer Meryl, Angelina or Sandra.\n\nOk, obviously, it has to do with the quantity and quality of her work. She hasn't worked in a while and even her most recent films weren't big successes. I'm sure that has cost her some fans. But that's the difference between someone who likes her and a true Pfan.\n\nPeople love a humanitarian. Someone who donates money to charities, attends galas for nature causes; those sorts of things. It's safe to say that Michelle hates the spotlight. Remember her quote: \"I act for free, but I demand a huge salary for being a public personality.\" If you want to gain star-status, you should go to the right parties, attend important events, and so on. But Michelle doesn't want to be a public personality. This explains why we haven't seen her in so long. I'm not saying she is doing this on purpose to minimize her fan base, but it's an inevitable outcome.\n\nBut one thing she's forgetting. With a big fan base, comes big success. Don't you think Ch\u00e9ri would've been much more appreciated if Meryl Streep had starred in it? I guarantee she'd get an Oscar nomination, probably even win. I'm not saying that she could do it better than Michelle, I mean, come on! It's just that Meryl is a generally more respected actress. Besides, no offense, but it's like a rule that all her movies have to be nominated or something! It's so disgraceful that Sandra Bullock won for 'The blind side'. Ok, the movie wasn't horrible, but really, each of the other nominees deserved it more. But that's Hollywood. Sandra is America's sweetheart and the Academy plays on that. Michelle's hugely underrated and that's such a shame. But the blame really is on her dislike of publicity. If she would do something about her publicity, she could be huge. But that brings us back to the beginning; Michelle doesn't like publicity! And that equals few Pfans.\n\nBut I don't mind Pfans being so few in number. Their dedication and loyalty are infinite!\n\nMonday, August 2, 2010\n\nI've always kind of liked Angelina Jolie, but never so much that I watched movies just because she's in it. Lately though, I've become fond of her and her movies. First of all she has a very wide range. Her characters are all so different. People see her as the typical lead in action movies, which she is on some level. But her roles in \"The changeling\", \"Girl, interrupted\" and \"Life or something like it\" were every bit as good as \"Wanted\", \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" and \"Salt\". Secondly, I like her attitude towards the media. She has no agent or anything and she's very open in interviews. I find her honesty about being bisexual pretty cool. She definitely appreciates her fans. She once signed autographs for an hour! Also, I like her approach in roles. It takes a lot of courage and self-confidence to do the kind of sex scenes she has done. She's shameless and daring. Lastly, she's a great humanitarian. Donates millions to good causes, she's even a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador. And she's simply a beautiful woman.\n\nBut let me make something very clear (Higg, read carefully :p). No one, I repeat, no one could ever replace Michelle as my number one. She will always be my favorite actress, forever.\n\nThe difference between my fandom for Michelle and my liking towards Angelina is in the opposition. Michelle and Angelina differ like water and fire. When you look at Michelle you see grace, when you look at Angelina you see sex. Angelina appears naked in a lot of her movies, Michelle got uncomfortable in \"Tequila sunrise\" when only her behind was shown. They could never change movies. Can you imagine Angelina in \"Dangerous liaisons\"? or Michelle in \"Original sin\"? I can't. They have one thing in common though. They're both beautiful, extraordinary actresses who are not afraid of a risky choice in movies.\n\nLet's face it; Michelle has kind of passed her smoking years (90s) and she's barely working. I don't think we can expect a lot more Pfilms. Angelina, on the other hand, is now in her golden period and is constantly making movies. So with Michelle slowing down, I found (though small) a consolation in Angie.\n\nI think it's OK for Pfans to like other actors. As long as they remember who's on top"}

{"text":"Becoming Jane is a historical-romantic flight of fancy that takes a nugget of verifiable history and poses the intriguing question, \"What if Jane Austen had lived a Jane Austen novel?\" English scholars and literary enthusiasts have long admired Austen's socially astute novels and her delicious play with irony, and screenwriters Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams have essentially taken those ingredients and stirred up a new batch of Brit lit for the screen, but this time with Austen herself as the intelligent and feisty young women caught between her romantic desires and the restrictive social pressures of rural England in the Regency Era.\n\nWhen the film opens, Jane (Anne Hathaway) is a young woman still living at home with her father, Reverend Austen (James Cromwell), and mother (Julie Walters). Already possessed of the desire to capture the world in prose, she spends her early mornings composing bits of novels and happily striking at the piano when she hits a phrase of absolute perfection. Her older sister, Cassandra (Anna Maxwell Martin), is engaged to marry a respectable young man, and Jane's mother worries that Jane will die a poor old maid because their family is not wealthy enough to support an unmarried woman. As she puts it quite bluntly, \"Affection is desirable; money is absolutely indispensable.\" Her father is more sympathetic to Jane's plight, but he has his limitations, as well, especially when he preaches in a sermon that women gifted with intelligence and wit should keep it all but hidden.\n\nJane's insistence that she will be able to live by her pen is considered something just beneath ridiculous, but she believes in herself enough to turn down a marriage proposal by Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox), the favored nephew of the snobbish local moneybags Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith). It is not that Mr. Wisley is a bad guy, it's just that Jane feels no affection for him, and she is resolute in her belief that no good marriage can exist without affection. Her mother and everyone else seem to take the exact opposite approach: marriage is about financial stability and social respectability, not romance and love.\n\nJane is much more intrigued by Tom Lefroy (James McAboy), a carousing Irish lawyer from London who is sent to live with his rural relatives by his stern uncle as punishment for his reveling ways (which include boxing, boozing, and consorting with prostitutes). With his fashionable green velvet jacket and air of urban sophistication, Tom fancies himself a chip off the block of his literary hero, Tom Jones. Jane is, of course, immediately repelled by him and his arrogant and selfish ways (one the film's funniest writerly moments is when she composes a long, rambling, critical description of him, then scratches it out muttering, \"Too many adjectives\").\n\nYet, just like Mr. Darcy in Austen's novel Pride & Prejudice, which the film imagines Austen writing in response to her relationship with Tom, the unctuous young interloper begins to grow on her, and soon they recognize in each other kindred spirits. (While history has noted that Austen and Lefroy did meet and have some sort of relationship, there is nothing to suggest that it was the passionate affair imagined in Becoming Jane.) Unfortunately, their relationship is not embraced by others (he is considered tainted by his previous behavior and she is seen as a poor country mouse trying to feed on the elite's cheese), which brings up the question: Will they rebel against social norms in their quest for happiness or fold beneath the heavy weight of social expectations?\n\nThe idea that Jane Austen wrote great romances that also doubled as knowing social comedies because she lived them directly is an intriguing idea, and director Julian Jarrold (Kinky Boots) turns Becoming Jane into something more than just a game of literary \"what if?,\" which is important since there have already been so many Jane Austen movies in recent years. Comparisons to Shakespeare in Love (1998) are inevitable, and even if it doesn't quite rise to that film's delicate balancing of romance, tragedy, and comedy, it still works surprisingly well, especially in the way the screenplay literally drips with well-chosen phrases and clever, airy dialogue that is the very epitome of being erudite without being incomprehensible.\n\nAnne Hathaway always makes for a genuinely appealing protagonist, and she projects a quiet mixture of wily intelligence and real vulnerability. Perhaps because of her role last summer in The Devil Wears Prada (2006) she feels particularly modern in the 19th-century setting, but that subtly works to her advantage. James McAvoy (The Last King of Scotland), with his unconventional looks and Ewan McGregor-ish charm, was also a good choice to play Tom; you can believe that this is the kind of man a woman like Austen would fall for. It's not exactly Pride & Prejudice, but it's an enjoyable appetizer, albeit for a meal that one could argue already has far too many courses."}

I watched the film in a state of rapt enjoyment.\n\nThere's a special pleasure in watching the familiar tropes of noir transferred to an \"exotic\" locale, whether it be the recent Korean film \"Mother\" or, going back much further, Luchino Visconti's \"Ossessione,\" which essentially borrowed the plot of James M. Cain's \"The Postman Always Rings Twice.\" The brainchild of stuntman-turned-first-time-director Nash Edgerton, \"The Square\" is so promiscuous in its lifts, from Cain and Chandler and everything in between, that the price of admission should include a handy reference guide. But this pileup of borrowings is part of the film's appeal; we're encouraged to recognize how cleverly Edgerton has made them his own.\n\nIn a sense, noir plots are as rigorously codified as, say, haiku. Originality isn't essential; execution is all. In \"The Square,\" we have as its centerpiece a classic noir Everyman \u2013 or I should say, Everydupe. Raymond (David Roberts) is a married construction supervisor in suburban Sydney who is carrying on with his married, and much younger, hairdresser neighbor Carla (Claire van der Boom). Raymond keeps promising to leave his wife for her, and when Carla notices that her bullyboy husband, \"Smithy\" (Anthony Hayes), has stashed a wad of ill-gained loot in the attic, she tips off Raymond and presses him to take her, and the cash, far away."}

His main adversary is Javsnooze (Russell Crowe), who hates him cause he's a better Australian singer than he'll ever be. One day, Snooze Valsnooze escapes and then finds asylum in a church, but then he steals stuff from the church, is caught, but the priest lies for Valsnooze, which makes no sense, unless the priest wanted to sleep with him, but he doesn't, cause he's not a small boy [PRIEST JOKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!]\n\nThen years pass and Snooze Valsnooze now has a new identity and owns some sort of sewing company that employees a comely but really poor Snoozetine (Anne Hathaway), who can't stop crying cause she has a daughter that she needs to feed, but needs a job to feed her, but she can't really do her job cause she can't stop crying, so basically she's the world's worst employee. Snoozetine gets fired (SHOCKER), so she sells her hair and her teeth and her body, and sings a song about dreaming and basically dies, then dies. Is this a dream or a nightmare??? Snooze Valsnooze feels bad that she died cause he's a thief with a heart of gold, and a voice of platinum!!!, so he takes Snoozetine's daughter Snoozesette (younger version played by Isabelle Allen & older version by Amanda Seyfried), but then Snooze Valsnooze has to run away cause Javsnooze smells his faux sewing ruse, so Snoozesette lands in the hands of Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett (Sacha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter, the only BRIGHT spot in 9 hours of dark and dreary bllllaaaaaahhhhhhhness), who are like slimy innkeepers who also sing cause the musical play theater play musical said they had to\n\nAnywho, Snooze Valsnooze returns to take his faux kid back from the comic relievers, and he does, and then Valsnooze and Snoozesette get new identities like 'Boring Valborings' & 'Boringsette', and then hide in some little Hobbit house in a graveyard or something. Then a fake French Revolution happens and that annoying redhead who faux bedded Marylin Monroe (Eddie Redmayne) sees Boringsette walking around Francetown and instantly falls in love with her, but he's being secretly loved by Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett's real daughter (Samantha Barks), but her story doesn't matter, even though she's hot, and how is it that that annoying redheaded guy has two women who want to bang him?? He's so lame that even his left hand refuses to beat him off\n\nAnywho, the half-assed revolution begins by the dirty French people throwing furniture into the streets, and then the army shoots all of them, cause the furniture pile is a giant mess. Most of the revolutionaries die (SPANK DAWG, cause it means the movie's closer to ending), but Boring Valborings saves that annoying redhead cause he knows that he would be a good person to bang his faux daughter Boringsette for eternity. Then he feels ashamed for some reason and disappears, and then Javsnooze reappears and is ashamed or something (mainly cause of his singing voice) so he kills himself, and then Boring Valborings dies, but right before he does, he gets to see Boringsette's face one last time (see below)\n\nThink that was what the movie was. Wait, WHAT THE FCUK WAS THAT? That story is not even a story, and it's stretches longer than turning the 310 paged Hobbit book into 3 Hobbit movies. Les Snooze feels like 19 Hobbits. It tastes like boring. It's so fcuking snoozy. Sure, it's well made and stuff, but so are guns, and guns kill people. Les Mis\u00e9rables will kill any joy you have in your body.

{"text":"Rep Pick: Red Light Bandit\n\nThe Red Light Bandit (1968)\nDirected by Rog\u00e9rio Sganzerla\nSunday, April 8 and Thursday, April 12 at the Spectacle Theater\n\nMy movie event of the year so far was a Rotterdam retrospective of films from the Boca do Lixo. The \"Mouth of Garbage\" lies in the heart of S\u00e1o Paulo, and during the 1960s the working-class neighborhood filled city papers with stories of poverty, corruption, and crime. It also produced a lot of great, grungy movies, made quick and cheap by any means necessary. A lot of these filthy-minded wonders\u2014The Margin, The Pornographer, Orgy or: The Man Who Gave Birth\u2014could only exist as independent productions, especially during Brazil's censorious military dictatorship's rule. 1968's The Red Light Bandit came through the grace of studio funding, but shares its rebellious brethrens' spirit. In time Rog\u00e9rio Sganzerla's movie became one of those classics so beloved that few people still talk about how radical it is.\n\nIf you live in Brazil, that is. It's hard to come by this baby in the States, which makes attending the Spectacle's digital projections a near-imperative. At them you can see (in clear, sharp, black-and-white) a smooth criminal (Paulo Villa\u00e7a) robbing, raping, and murdering his way through the city, and doing such a job of it that he turns from man into legend. The radio announcers label him the \"Zorro of the poor,\" the journalists plaster their walls with his pictures, and a fat politician smiles at the thought of feeding the tourists more folklore. The ruling powers stay in place by robbing the bandit of the right to tell his own story. He can crash through society, but he can't turn it topsy-turvy.\n\nThe film cuts lightning fast between its man's multiple failed suicide attempts; cartoon style crashes into real human despair, as the bandit sags under the weight of being made into a symbol. But if his actions, once made immortal, are doomed to repeat themselves, they can also inspire new witnesses each time. Part of the bandit's legend (romantic, sad, or both) is that the low can combat the ones at the top. \"Those with shoes won't survive!\" a mad character calls, and at film's end the shoeless masses take joyously to the streets. Laws are what make people criminals, imprisoning them inside social structures, and lawlessness can be an expression of freedom. As long as there's justice, there will be bandits."}
{"text":"Viva Riva\n\nI have a bad habit of giving subtitled films a much easier time than those in a language I can understand. Viva Riva!, set in Senator Norris' old stomping ground, the vividly manky Kinshasa, is a crime-thriller about bootleggers and wannabe gangsters that takes place in a swirl of Congolese Lingala, French and Angolan Portuguese. The impressive setting (this is an entirely Congolese production) and the flurry of the languages set up a barrier to stop you realising immediately, though not eventually, just how well-worn the story-lines are or even from judging individual performances. The obvious comparison that springs to mind is a less complex, less interesting, African version of Cidade de Deus. Chock full of big-swinging-mickey characters who are generally riding or racking up the body-count. Viva Riva! lacks the subtlety required to distinguish itself from the pack at anything other than surface level."}
{"text":"September 21, 2012\n\nBlue Thunder is the name of a black military-style helicopter with advanced surveillance and heavy firepower capabilities. It also is tied into data banks with information on individuals. The helicopter is one of the main stars of the film. The other is Roy Scheider, who delivers an excellent performance as he always does. He carries the film over its many weak spots.\n\nIn 1983 the idea that the federal government wants to militarize the local police forces and the idea that it will use false flag events to get what it wants were less common than 30 years later (today). Introducing these themes is a major contribution of the script. In the script, the federal government bad guys murder a community activist so as to produce riots so that Blue Thunder will be adopted by the LA police.\n\nAfter seeing the data bank and other capabilities, Scheider, who is a helicopter pilot and tests Blue Thunder, says this: \"A dozen of these and you could run the country.\" Not so far-fetched.\n\nThe film is inconsistent. When Blue Thunder is introduced, the horns give us patriotic glorious-style music, there are glowing orange heavenly clouds from which the vehicle descends, and visually it is treated as some kind of personification of the superior technology of the superior American soul. Soon we find that the federal government has all the bad guys, while the LA police who use their own helicopters to fight crime are depicted as the good guys. There is in fact a long opening sequence that glorifies the swooping and snooping of the smaller LA helicopters.\n\nBlue Thunder provides a slam-bag demonstration of its firepower in a staged exhibition in which there is much simulated collateral damage. Scheider is wincing every time the helicopter accidentally takes out a dummy that portrays civilians and then it takes out a busload. The LA police would never go for such excessive firepower \u2014 that's the message. And that message is repeated at the end when the federal government starts firing heat-seeking missiles from F-16s over LA, and they go wrong. Hollywood has to have good guys and bad guys. They can't all be bad, except in film noir which this isn't. Life is getting to be more like film noir, as the lines between local police and federal agents, data banks, armor, techniques, and military arms are blurred. So LA hasn't reached the stage of using F-16s quite yet, but on the ground the SWAT teams are not exactly your friendly cops walking a beat; and we are seeing tank-like vehicles coming into use.\n\nAfter the demonstration of Blue Thunder's overkill, the federal guy attempts to save face, saying \"That kind of firepower would be used in our worst-case scenario like armed insurrection.\" This is 9\u201310 years before Ruby Ridge and Waco. It's 4 years before Robocop, in which the machine really goes wild during a demonstration.\n\nThere is a sequence in which Scheider and his co-pilot hover quietly outside an office building and record the conspirators who are planning to kill him. Fast forward to spy drones equipped with listening devices and the surveillance state grows exponentially. The surveillance state is already upon us. There will have to be limits, just as there have to be limits to debt. If people will sabotage cameras that monitor intersections, they will learn to sabotage intrusive spying devices even if it means taking down whole networks."}
{"text":"Tag Archives: Don ZimmermanIf it weren't for the cast and direction, I'm not sure how The Package would play. The combination of Gene Hackman and Andrew Davis makes the film, which has a bunch of problems, noteworthy. Davis gives the film enough grit and realism to make it seem wholly believable, just so long as one doesn't think about it much while watching it.\n\nAfter a couple starts, about thirty minutes in, it becomes clear The Package is an assassination thriller. Unfortunately, it's not a particularly compelling assassination thriller. Without Hackman holding it together, it'd fail. Even worse, the first two starts promise something far more interesting and unique.\n\nEven the assassination thriller part starts better than it ends. With a slightly different approach, The Package would be a road movie. It's still basically arranged in that manner\u2013principle supporting characters show up in sequence, not all at once. First it's Tommy Lee Jones (in a glorified cameo, which is too bad since he and Hackman are great together), then Pam Grier (solid in a thankless role) and finally Dennis Franz (playing a family man variation of his cop standard). Joanna Cassidy shows up between Jones and Grier and sticks around.\n\nNearly all the supporting cast is excellent, regardless of how much they have to do. Kevin Crowley, Chelcie Ross, Thalmus Rasulala\u2013small roles, great performances (Rasulala doesn't even get a name).\n\nThe only weak performance is John Heard, which hurts me to even type but he's just bad.\n\nThe Package is okay, if problematic.\n\nCREDITS\n\nDirected by Andrew Davis; written by John Bishop; director of photography, Frank Tidy; edited by Billy Weber and Don Zimmerman; music by James Newton Howard; production designer, Michel Levesque; produced by Beverly J. Camhe and Tobie Haggerty; released by Orion Pictures.\n\nI rarely worry about how I'm going to get 250 words about a film. Rocky IV probably features 251 words of dialogue. Well, closer to 251 than not, anyway.\n\nReally, what is there to say about this one? Stallone directs it poorly? Stallone substitutes montages and music videos for actual narrative content? It's a ludicrous proposition from the opening credits, which directly involve the film's eventual content of the U.S. versus the U.S.S.R. in the boxing ring\u2013except it's a narrative development, not something the film opens with. So, even though it looks cool (did they use hot air balloons for the boxing gloves) for a while, it's nonsensical. It's a reference to something the film's characters don't even know about yet, but the viewer would from the theatrical trailer\u2026 so it's titles just for the viewer, which is rather goofy\u2026 but Stallone knows (or knew) his audience. They didn't think.\n\nIt's strange also because of the disjointedness. The beginning is this whole picture about Rocky's boring eighties lifestyle with cars and robots and Carl Weathers thinking he's getting old, then it turns into the east versus west thing. The montages don't start until after Weathers dies.\n\nHowever, none of that paragraph is to say the opening is good\u2013well acted, directed or written\u2013it's just a solid narrative. Unlike the rest of the picture, which is a forty-five minute music video with some digressions.\n\nLots of people enjoy watching Rocky IV, regardless of its quality.\n\nI do not.\n\nCREDITS\n\nWritten and directed by Sylvester Stallone; director of photography, Bill Butler; edited by John W. Wheeler and Don Zimmerman; music by Vince DiCola; production designer, Bill Kenney; produced by Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler; released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nI forgot MGM still made movies in the 1990s. The aura of bankruptcy and failure has surrounded Leo for so long\u2026 it's distracting. I remember my Diggstown laserdisc sleeve. It's been at least ten years since I've seen the movie. It's still a great time and I'm left, as I always was when finishing it, perplexed. How did James Woods not have a successful film career as a leading man? Diggstown might have even his last major lead role.\n\nDiggstown has a large cast\u2013figure twenty recognizable cast members\u2013and the casting is brilliant. It might have been the first movie I ever saw Oliver Platt in. The film's broken up into three parts (not the acts, however). The prison prologue, the set-up, then the long boxing sequence (Louis Gossett Jr. fighting ten guys, which is why the cast is so large). Each section feels different, with Woods owning the prologue, but Platt getting the most attention in the opening of the set-up. It's a bombastic role and Platt's perfect for it. There isn't a bad performance in the entire film (Ritchie's a fine director of actors), but the acting from Platt, Woods and Gossett is just amazing. Each one of them turn in singular performances\u2013so it's unfortunate Diggstown doesn't offer them much more to do.\n\nThe film's funny, endearing and constantly enjoyable, but there's a certain lack of depth to it. There's nuance in the film\u2013when Gossett and Woods meet up at the beginning, they're having an intricately guarded conversation, combining the acting, the direction and the editing. But the nuance doesn't carry over to the film. It has a simple close. There isn't much opportunity for a deeper story here, but there's some (the flirtation between Woods and Heather Graham evaporates as the boxing part of the film begins).\n\nInstead, it's just a good time, with a great, self-aware performance from Bruce Dern. I'm not always a fan, but when Dern's on, he's really on. The supporting cast\u2013John Short, Duane Davis, even Michael DeLorenzo\u2013has some standouts as well.\n\nDiggstown is a well put together film\u2013Ritchie doesn't have a single unsure directorial moment, every move is confident\u2013and it makes Diggstown one of the finer junior members of the era's films. Diggstown is a contained, inclusive filmic narrative\u2013the viewer isn't supposed to engage with Woods as a celebrity, only his performance. There's even a \"Roots\" reference and, even if it was supposed to be an in-joke with Gossett, it doesn't come off as one.\n\nBefore I finish up, I need to mention James Newton Howard's score. The score's great, really changing pace as the film does\u2013not only does Diggstown have those twenty or so characters for the viewer to remember, it has a lot of locations too\u2013Howard keeps up with everything, developing the score inline with the narrative.\n\nOn one hand, I wish Diggstown had a little more depth\u2013the film has room for it, Ritchie and the cast can certainly handle it, but maybe not\u2026 It's a solid, smart, well-made comedy. I remember when I first saw it, on videotape, I couldn't wait to see what Woods and Platt did next. Platt did well enough, Woods provided a frequent disappointment. Even this time through, sixteen years after it came out, it's hard not to be excited at the talent on display in the film.\n\nCREDITS\n\nDirected by Michael Ritchie; screenplay by Steven McKay, based on a novel by Leonard Wise; director of photography, Gerry Fisher; edited by Don Zimmerman; music by James Newton Howard; production designer, Stephen Hendrickson; produced by Robert Schaffel; released by Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer.\n\nIt must have been Bette Midler's former manager, Aaron Russo (Teachers's producer), who somehow confused Arthur Hiller as the creative force behind The Hospital.Teachers is very much like The Hospital, but in its stoic protagonist, the stoic protagonist's ultimate choice in the end, and the strange hijinks. However, as is clearly evidenced by JoBeth Williams's strange, too flat to be absurdist nudist jaunt, Hiller is not a social commentator. He's the guy who'd go on to direct Carpool and National Lampoon's Pucked.\n\nHiller isn't the biggest problem with Teachers. The film could survive his competent and unimaginative direction\u2013Hiller seems to have influenced not just every modern sitcom director, but also Jon Favreau, who's a similarly torpid director. The problem is the script. I don't know if W.R. McKinney used to be a teacher (it seems likely for press purposes, regardless of uncredited script doctors), but he's a terrible writer. He's got severe problems with dialogue and his plotting is awkward. Some of his details are good\u2013he's got some funny stuff. But mostly he's awful.\n\nWhat makes Teachers work is the acting. Nick Nolte runs the whole thing. He's got a big monologue\u2013poorly written\u2013and Nolte, even with Hiller's lame direction and Don Zimmerman's incapable editing, makes it work. He makes it superior.\n\nMuch of the supporting cast is good\u2013Judd Hirsch is good as the sellout (rebel teacher turned assistant principal), Allen Garfield as the befuddled but well-meaning teacher, Richard Mulligan (in one of McKinney's stupidest moves), Morgan Freeman, William Schallert. Williams is okay in her inessential and unlikely role. Ralph Macchio\u2013idiotic costume aside\u2013runs hot and cold. Lee Grant and Laura Dern are terrible, particularly Grant, who has no excuse (Teachers was one of Dern's first films and her character is, to be fair, atrociously written).\n\nBut the Aaron Russo-produced white guy soundtrack\u2013Bob Seger, Joe Cocker, ZZ Top\u2013takes center stage, big shock (the advertisement for the soundtrack is the second end credits card, right after Russo's credit for producing it too). The soundtrack's poorly handled, like no one told Hiller it'd be there; not to mention the sound levels being confusing (is the music playing for the characters during Nolte and Williams's date, or just for the moviegoer).\n\nTeachers has\u2013until the very end\u2013a certain optimism going for it. It loses it then, when the script\u2013shock of shocks\u2013crumbles under its own ridiculousness. A better director could have helped, but not without an artistically-minded (versus soundtrack album sales minded) producer and a great rewrite. Still, seeing Hirsch in a film makes it worthwhile to some degree. And Nolte does have some fantastic moments.\n\nCREDITS\n\nDirected by Arthur Hiller; screenplay by W.R.

{"text":"What I'm Watching: The Men Who Stare at Goats\n\nOne of the quirkiest movies I've seen in years, The Men Who Stare at Goats is a bizarre comedy that pushes the limits of my suspension of disbelief, but ultimately left me laughing and feeling oddly satisfied.\n\nBased on the book by Jon Ronson, The Men Who Stare at Goats features Ewan McGregor as a reporter who flees his divorce by trying to become an embedded reporter in the Iraq war. While there, he runs across Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a man who he has been told was involved in a secret Army project in the 80s to develop soldiers with psychic powers. As we watch, two stories unfold simultaneously \u2014 the tale of the original \"New Earth Army,\" and the tale of Cassady and McGregor's Bob Wilton as they race across Iraq on a mission that Cassady is remaining disturbingly tight-lipped about.\n\nFor a movie about the army set in 2003 Iraq, it's refreshingly apolitical. Director Grant Heslov isn't trying to beat any agenda into the audience's heads, and the story is far more amusing than it is chilling or thought-provoking, even if it does seem a bit goofy. Ronson's book, which I have not read, is about a supposed real-life military arm that tried experiments to develop paranormal abilities such as psychic location, telepathy, emotion control, and other such talents that could have practical purposes. While I have no trouble believing that the army would attempt such experiments, the plot here goes far outside of the realm of belief, regardless of what the opening lines of the film proclaim. The program itself isn't really treated as a joke, just the reactions and character of several of the people involved.\n\nThe cast is good. Clooney handles his role with an appropriate gravity, and Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the failed writer whose participation in the program is far more selfish than that of his comrades. Jeff Bridges is almost channeling The Dude as he plays the reborn hippie that develops the project, and he drives most of the flashback sequences.\n\nMcGregor is a good actor, and very good in this part, but I almost think that casting him was a mistake. The participants in the project name themselves after characters from a popular movie series of the time \u2014 they're called \"The Jedi.\" Which is appropriate enough, but when you have McGregor asking what a Jedi is, how people become a Jedi, what a Jedi's powers are and so forth, it does pull you out of the movie. Virtually every time the word \"Jedi\" or another other Star Wars reference was made with him on the screen, half the audience began tittering with amusement. It's funny enough the first few times, but soon I found it becoming distracting. There's even a reference to the \"Dark Side\" at a rather serious moment that I couldn't help but giggle at. McGregor did a fine job, but I wonder if it may not have served the story better if the character who was trying to uncover the secret of the Jedi wasn't the guy who played Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nI liked this movie. It wasn't a knockout punch, but it was funny enough and I felt like I got my money's worth.\n\nI haven't read the book, but I've read a lot of surrounding material and the unanimous opinion from everyone who discussess the project is that it was real. No more idiotic than some of the ideas generated waaaay back to kill Castro\u2026 Exploding cigars and soldiers running into walls attepting to pass straight through them \u2013 you couldn't make stuff like that up."}
{"text":"Cloud Atlas\n\nI've spent 3 days just thinking about Cloud Atlas, the latest movie from the filmmaking team responsible for bringing The Matrix to life. It's at once an epic story that spans generations, an ambitious project that stretches cinematic boundaries, a meta critique of the nature of genre and the inherent limitations therein, and a deeply intimate story about what we all need to find satisfaction in our lives.\n\nI'm just not sure if it is good.\n\nTom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant and a host of other familiar faces don disguises to play a variety of characters whose lives intersect and intertwine across the ages. There isn't a through narrative in the story; rather these are a series of intercut stories about subjects that have no connection outside a theme of the importance of finding peace, whatever your situation.\n\nTo describe the plots would be an exercise in futility, because it's not the stories themselves that will draw you in but instead the way they are told and how they are performed. There is not a bad performance in this movie, all of the actors buying completely into the concept and giving it their all. I could see a best ensemble award given for this group but there are no particular standouts.\n\nAs to the stories that make up the whole, they are diverse and fascinating, any one I would have been curious to explore on its own. There's a comedic tale of a man running from his debtors who gets locked up in a retirement community by his vengeful brother. The story of a man who sees the evil of the slave trade and his fight to return home to his beloved bride (and the stowaway slave who becomes his protector). A grand composer and his eager understudy who quickly learns he is not in a position to make his own name. A tale of how human clones are exploited by the evil corporations that run the world. The post-apocalyptic story of a woman searching for the truth in a world annihilated by war.\n\nThese are the threads that are used to sew the tapestry known as Cloud Atlas but the description does them no justice because it is the way they are utilized that makes them special. It's a historical tale, a film about classical artists, a modern comedy, a dystopian sci-fi flick and a post-apocalyptic journey. A Sucker Punch with narrative drive that favors thematic concept over flash.\n\nEssentially a libertarian love story by way of Aldous Huxley, the Wachowskis have made a movie about the importance of freedom and the ties that bind all of humanity. As you would expect given the pedigree of the filmmakers, the effects are magnificent and never did I question the reality of the world presented.\n\nThe biggest critique is the way the film seems to imply a larger, cosmic purpose to these particular souls. Marked with comet-shaped birthmarks, I was expecting some grand reveal at the end, a man coming out from behind the curtain, or stepping from a podium, taking a bow and explaining everything to me. Perhaps taking a cue from the critiques of V for Vendetta and the Matrix sequels, the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer give no concrete resolution, leaving the interpretation completely to the viewer (who, if they have been paying attention, shouldn't have trouble following this film.)\n\nPerhaps the best thing I can say about Cloud Atlas is that I need to see it again. Soon. I'll give you advice that I wish I had going in: Don't try to \"figure it out.\" There's no twist, no grand reveal. This isn't Inception and you're not going to get a gold star for having an original interpretation.\n\nInstead, simply appreciate Cloud Atlas for the magnificent spectacle it is. A celebration of life and what makes it special, Cloud Atlas is a recommended experience."}

{"text":"\"Everything is everything.\" This stoical phrase one of several coined by Africa-Americans in the volatile times of the 1960s and 70s that would become a trope of an era, capturing in a matter-of-fact way the reality of oppression, despair and the imminence of death. It is simple, powerful, elegant and symmetrical. It is also mysterious, complex and asymmetrical. It is evoked and becomes a statement of fact on viewing Matt Norman's captivating and compelling film \"Salute\".\n\nThe opening minutes provide a dynamic collage describing the political ruptures of the era across the globe. These moments in the film lead one to conclude that 'then' is 'now', when looking at the world in a similar way today. What makes 'then' unique is a character like Peter Norman, the film's cynosure.\n\nThe film manages to iconise and be iconoclastic in equal measure. For many across several generations the photographic still of the Black Power salute from the 1968 summer Olympics in Mexico is highly familiar and the subjects of fascination are the two African-American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos. Peter Norman, the silver medallist in that 200m final, we are made to realise is an equal participant in the protest.\n\nNorman did not raise a fist but opened his heart and pinned a badge over it, a simple gesture of solidarity in humanity, which would be of detriment to his athletic. The film with some subtlety suggests the idea that Norman may have been the victim of the same racism faced by Carlos and Smith.\n\nWe come to know that the Australian Athletics Association effectively banned him from the 1972 Munich Olympics, and that he was not invited to attend the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, though still holding the Australian national record in the 200m.\n\nPolitics features heavily in this film but what also makes it consistently potent is that it never loses sight of the high quality athleticism and sportsmanship of each actor. 'Then', these men were superlative in several ways and that is what distinguishes that time and Peter Norman from 'now', despite everything still being everything."}

{"text":"Reviews\n\nJ. Edgar\n\nIt's hard to believe that audiences are just now seeing a biopic about J. Edgar Hoover, founder of the FBI and man with enough skeletons in his closet to curl one's hair. When one did get made it definite had some clout! The film J. Edgar boasts a director like Clint Eastwood and phenomenal performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Armie Hammer and Naomi Watts. The film is a taste clunky and long but the acting and story keep you riveted until the last scene.\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover (DiCaprio) is telling his life's story to fellow FBI agents writing his autobiography. Throughout the film one learns about his life, his relationship with his domineering mother (Judi Dench), his long-time secretary (Watts) and right-hand man Clyde Tolson (Hammer). As Hoover's power grew he found more manipulative ways to hold onto it including blackmailing the world's most prominent figures.\n\nEastwood and crew definitely make the film feel like the time periods depicted. From the grit of the 1930s to the flash of the 60's the film emphasizes and expertly highlights each period. There are several moments that just seem like loving tributes to film including scenes of characters in movie theaters watching films about gangsters and G-Men. The film lifts elements from film noir, especially with the focus on the Lindbergh kidnapping, and the political thriller in how Hoover holds onto his power. All throughout you doubt Hoover's version of events as in the beginning of the film he tells the agents to embellish bits of the story to \"add to the narrative.\" You begin to question if Hoover was at certain places or did certain things and it's not till the end you understand what's fact and fiction. Regardless, you're awed and scared of the man because it's apparent no matter if his details are accurate, they had the ability to instill fear and reverence in people.\n\nThe cast is what sells the film and what might allow this movie to hit big come Oscar time. DiCaprio is a presence as Hoover. The old age makeup has already been sighted as being atrocious, which it is, but DiCaprio still sells you on the character. The accent is a bit wobbly but when he strides into a room you feel he can harm a person. His chemistry with Hammer is electric and his relationship with Watts' Helen Gandy is one of mutual respect and friendship. Hammer is sweet and vulnerable as Clyde Tolson and you understand why he would come to care for a man like Hoover. The film doesn't shy away from stating what their relationship to each other was but you can see why each man found love for the other. Watts has a smaller role but she is fantastic as Helen Gandy, a woman struggling to have her own career who found respect in a world of men.\n\nThe film does have its flaw, mainly in pacing and runtime. The film is over two hours and does start to feel it, especially with how many times we jump back and forth. At times you have to struggle to orient yourself and ask \"when are we?\" It doesn't help with the most minute of scene changes. The transitions are triggered by objects a character sees that segues into the next scene. Sometimes these transitions have little connection to them so it's hard to figure out why that particular event or element caused us to jump forward or backward in time. By the end it seems like you're yo-yoing back and forth with little rhyme or reason. Dench's role as J. Edgar's mother Anne is by far the most clich\u00e9 and over the top. A scene where she tells J. Edgar about his friend \"Daffy\" screamed of cheesiness and the way she tells if you're almost wondering if she wants to replace the word \"daffodil\" with a gay slur, it's that smarmy and mean-spirited. It's unnecessary from the character and there's no reason why Dench has to play the character so villainous.\n\nDespite a clunky set-up the performance and story keeps you engaged. From the Lindbergh case to the Kennedy's there's a ton of history to wade through and be wowed by. I wouldn't be surprised to see Oscar nods for Hammer, DiCaprio and Watts at some point. If you miss this in theaters definitely check it out on DVD!"}
{"text":"Three Takes on the Entertainment World\n\nTag Archives: Silicon valley\n\nThe Pirates of Silicon Valley stars Noah Wyle and Anthony Michael Hall as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates respectively. Both do an outstanding job in portraying the genius, drive, and fallacies of the two pioneers in the tech industry.\n\nThe movie chronicles the rise of Apple and Microsoft and their eventual clash as the two vie to usher in the personal computing age. Since the movie was released in 1999, the movie does not touch on the iphone or even ipod years at Apple. Rather, it ends with the surprising partnership between the two tech behemoths in 1997.\n\nI will admit I am not well versed in the history, so I cannot vouch for the film's accuracy. Regardless I found the story in the film compelling with the two men not being portrayed as necessarily the smartest tech guys but the most astute business men. Both Jobs and Gates seized the day as key opportunities presented themselves. Jobs essentially swindled Xerox out of the technology behind graphical user interfaces and Gates practically stole DOS for a mere fifty grand.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the performances, I wish the film delved deeper into what made each man tick. The movie starts out with both men already aspiring to lead the personal computing crusade. However, it would have made for a better movie had we understood why each were so driven to do what they did. Nowadays, it is expected for everyone to have a computer. Back then though, what was their inspiration to defy convention and aim to put a computer in every home? What was the moment that the \"apple\" hit them on the head?\n\nAnother flaw in the film is that it simply ends with no real climax. All of a sudden we get some text on the screen saying Jobs was kicked out of Apple. Then we jump ahead a few years, and he's reconciled with Bill Gates and agreed to a partnership. The film should have shown more of how the two came to this new agreement. How did they get past their differences?\n\nThe upcoming Steve Jobs movie would do well to differentiate itself from this previous film by providing a more personal look at his life. The Pirates of Silicon Valley was a good film but it felt more like a Wikipedia entry rather than a thorough retrospective on the forefathers of personal computing.\n\nI chose to watch The Pirates of Silicon Valley after hearing Ashton Kutcher would be playing Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic. I never had a chance to watch this movie when it first premiered on television.\n\nI'm not quite expecting something as good as The Social Network, but I have heard good things about the movie. Since the movie came out in 1999, it will not touch on the iphone or even ipod years at Apple. However, I am looking forward to the conflict between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, especially since they seemed to be very close towards to the end of Jobs's life."}
{"text":"Stephen has consumed\u2026\n\nAs a piece of American Pop culture, this movie is on the must see list. \"Sometimes a man has to lose himself to find himself,\" Burt Reynolds says, setting the stage for a parable about civilization's encroachment on the few remaining wild places and sinister hillbillies that leads to a dehumanizing experience. It seems a bit uneven and episodic while watching it again, but still it is a movie frequently referenced in sitcoms and trivia games."}
{"text":"You are unlikely to see a movie about incest made as sensitively and tastefully as Womb. And although the characters speak English, the film is firmly anchored in European sensibilities, thanks to its Hungarian director, Benedek Fliegauf.\n\nAn incestuous payoff might be expected, given the casting of Green; she first attracted widespread attention in Bertolucci's \"The Dreamers,\" as a young woman who is unusually close to her brother. But whatever happens, Womb is more melancholy than erotic.\n\nIf the 20-odd seconds of blank screen squatting pointlessly amid the opening credits aren't enough warning that you're in for some seriously sluggish storytelling, then the adoption of a snail as one of the central motifs should drive the point home.\n\nSpare yourself this awful crap. There are millions of ways to spend 111 minutes that would be far more enjoyable. Like colonoscopy, or root canal. If you insist on watching anyway, be sure there are fresh batteries in the remote. Fast forward will be your only savior.\u2026Full Review \u00bb"}
{"text":"Desire to Kill is the debut feature by Owen Cho and Kim Sang-Hwa but you would never know it because this thriller is so well put together with such flair and smart writing it makes many other films from more experienced directors look creatively barren.\n\nAfter the death of his wife, Kim Min-Ho (Cheon Ho-Jin) repeatedly tries to commit suicide. His efforts leave him in hospital and paralysed from neck down. He is overwhelmed by his muddled memories and the desire to kill the murderer of his wife. When an unconscious man named Sang-Up (Yu Hae-Jin) is brought into Kim Min-Ho's room he discovers that he is the murderer and is suffering amnesia and paralysis. The two are under the care of Nurse Ha (Seo Hyo-Rim) and Dr. Paik (Kim Seo-Hyung) who is performing brain surgery on Sang-Up whilst feeding the two an untested medicine named AAP. Kim Min-Ho finds himself in a race to recover before Sang-Up so he can exact his revenge.\n\nThe film begins on July 25th 1984 with Min-Ho stating \"Weather clear. I plan to kill a man today but I can't remember his face.\" This is the start of a film which features a great thriller plot accompanied by black comedy all wrapped up in great visuals but what really impresses is the exploration of memory.\n\nMemory can be a tricky thing. When we bring in different interpretations it can be the least reliable thing around. It is a subject regularly explored in films like Memento, The Bourne Identity and Retribution. If I had to make a comparison with another film it would be Oldboy as it gives us two characters defined by memory, or lack of it in one case, and pulls back their layers of memory as part of an intricately constructed plot tied to one character's desire to kill.\n\nFor this film Min-Ho and Sang-Up are our two mystery protagonists and the filmmakers use every trick in the book to make us constantly reassess them. The characters are all brilliantly written and the actors physically adhere to types. It is easy to take them at face value, especially with Min-Ho (Chun Ho-Jin who appeared in Doll Master) looking like a bedraggled underdog and Sang-Up acting like a loutish thug which is what actor Yu Hae-Jin is good at if you watch Kick the Moon and Public Enemy. The two are charismatic enough to blind us to any imperfections which allows the plot to surprise.\n\nI will not reveal any more, suffice it to say that the two actors give their all in physically demanding performances. Yes they are stuck on hospital beds and in wheelchairs due to the limited motor-functions of their characters but that does not stop them trying to kill each other and they go through hell as they attempt to do so.\n\nThe constant obsession with death is where the black comedy emerges. Watching the two racing to recover quickly before one gets his memory back is amusing as they constantly probe the progress their rival has made and engage in mad but limited training. Min-ho's constant pilfering of objects from nurses and making rather rubbish improvised weapons for his frenzied attacks also leads to amusing sequences. Nurse Ha's (Seo Hyo-Rim) obliviousness to the dark intentions of her two patients is also endearing.\n\nAll of this takes place in the realm of a hospital, sometimes in the grounds, the operating theatres, corridors but mostly in the room the two patients inhabit. It is never boring.\n\nThe directors display strong visual design. The film takes place in one location, a hospital, which has a lot of character. The physical set seems to reflect the actions\/memory stages of the patients. Initial daytime scenes when the plot and characters are simple are bright and clear, predominantly white with bright sunlight reflecting off bed sheets, doctor's uniforms. As the film progresses and the darkness emerges the colours reflect that as dark blues, tanned browns, sickly yellows, blood reds emerge.\n\nThe directors' deliver all of this with the use wide angle lenses\/dolly-shots to capture both patients in their wheelchairs or beds and set scenes. When there are realisations or a medical break-through there are close-ups on faces. Someone has been watching The Diving Bell and the Butterfly because the POV shots are blurred at edges. One fevered sequence, light flashes, bleeds out, cuts between shots rapidly, close-ups on things. I am listing things which is boring to read but actually watching them is exciting and even if the characters lack the ability to move you still feel so much energy coming from the screen.\n\nThis is yet another example of why Korea is considered one of the hottest and most creative centres of filmmaking and getting two interviews on the disc with the director and cast was fascinating.\n\nI have kept this review as vague as possible. I was blown away by the second half of the film as the plot unfolded and things became much more complex and surprising, becoming bigger and darker than I could have guessed but the sharp black humour and the excellent acting kept things running smoothly and with a great thriller plot like this it is a great film to watch and re-watch just to marvel at the intricate design.\n\n4 Responses to Desire to Kill \/ Enemy at the Dead End\n\nI still wonder how do they come up with such ideas, any Korean movie I saw featured a never-would-have thought-of-that story and the execution is top notch. Or I juts managed to watch only the best ones yet.\n\nThe style, invention and originality of Korean cinema is pretty amazing but as you suggest we're probably only seeing the best ones. I have seen quite a few romances and comedies that don't appeal to me (but they still look better than most things Hollywood has come up with!).\n\nWell most of the stuf I've seen were thrillers or horrors and I'm blown away. I think they are making the best quality movies right now, because they pay attention to every detail, and twists after twists after twists. I've just seen Oldboy and the last part of the movie new turns, so to say, just kept on coming."}
{"text":"In light of facts, Phil Spector film's message seems tone-deaf\n\nAre you planning to watch HBO's Phil Spector? Then step into my cubicle. We need to talk.\n\nI'm just a reporter, so my opinions about film aesthetics don't add up to much, but as one of the only journalists to cover both of Spector's murder trials, I can tell you that this movie, which premieres Sunday, is a bomb factually.\n\nAnd in an era when millions depend on The Daily Show for their news and best picture nominees for their history lessons, that scares me. Most viewers will know very little about the Spector case, and when the program is over, their understanding will be deeply flawed.\n\n\"Wow,\" I can hear them saying as the credits roll. \"I had no idea that Phil Spector was railroaded. Juries are so stupid. The entire justice system is a joke.\"\n\nOf course, filmmakers -- particularly one as talented as writer-director David Mamet -- are entitled to artistic license. But the problem here is that the movie blends fact and fiction into a misinformation smoothie. Characters bear the actual names of participants, dialogue is lifted directly from trial transcripts, and Al Pacino nails Spector's shuffle and rasp. But when the movie jets off to the land of make-believe -- as it often does -- there's no red flashing light to warn the audience.\n\nWhat's especially galling is that the film commits the very crime it condemns. Phil Spector argues that a famous eccentric can't get a fair trial because the bloodthirsty, ignorant public is willfully blind to the facts. But the movie supports its thesis by ignoring, misrepresenting and soft-pedaling the evidence.\n\nThe facts of the case\n\nOn Feb. 3, 2003, Spector met a struggling actress named Lana Clarkson at the Sunset Strip club where she worked as a hostess. They repaired to his mansion, where two hours later, she was shot in the mouth as she sat in a chair by the front door.\n\nAfter he was arrested on suspicion of murder, Spector claimed Clarkson killed herself. The first jury to hear the case deadlocked 10 to 2 in favor of guilt. A second jury convicted him in 2009.\n\nIn the film, we are told repeatedly and emphatically that there is no evidence Spector pulled the trigger.\n\n\"They have no facts!\" insists defense lawyer Linda Kenney Baden (played by Helen Mirren). It's as plain as Spector's white dinner jacket, the movie says. If he had shot her, we are informed again and again and again, the snowy fabric would be drenched in blood.\n\nIn fact, there was blood on Spector's jacket: Tiny mistlike spots near the lapel that, according to expert testimony, put Spector no more than 3 feet from Clarkson's face when the gun went off. The same type of blood mist was found on the outside of Clarkson's wrist, an indication, experts said, that at the time of the gunshot, her hands were up in a defensive posture and not on the trigger.\n\nThen there's the chauffeur. Spector's driver testified that shortly after the gunshot, his boss walked out of the mansion holding a gun in his bloodied hand. \"I think I killed somebody,\" he quoted Spector as saying. The film suggests that unethical police detectives forced the chauffeur to make this damning statement by threatening to charge him as an accessory.\n\nThere's no evidence of this, and Spector's lawyers never alleged it at trial. Probably because the driver told the first patrolman on the scene about Spector's comment and never varied in a subsequent recorded interview with detectives.\n\nFive women testified, often through tears, that Spector had pulled guns on them when they tried to leave his house against his wishes. They were unshakable in their accounts of how alcohol and dashed romantic hopes turned an old-school gentleman into a monster. The movie rolls its eyes at them. Just common people looking for their 15 minutes, instead of treasuring their time with the genius.\n\nSpector's defense claimed that Clarkson, 40, committed suicide because she was despondent over her prospects in Hollywood. The film ultimately embraces a second theory -- that she accidentally shot herself while toying suggestively with the gun.\n\nWhat it doesn't mention is that Clarkson died with her purse strap on her shoulder. If that seems inconsequential to you, perhaps you are a man. Ladies, I ask you: Is shouldering a purse the gesture of a woman who intends to a) commit suicide, b) play a sex game or c) leave?\n\nNot a 'true story'\n\nIn anticipation of criticism, HBO has taken pains to describe the movie as a \"mythological take\" on the case.\n\n\"This is a work of fiction,\" the disclaimer that opens the film reads. \"It's not 'based on a true story.' It is a drama inspired by actual persons in a trial, but it is neither an attempt to depict the actual persons, nor to comment upon the trial or its outcome.\"\n\nIt struck me as less a helpful piece of information than a warning to people who know the case well: Attempts to point out the film's many factual problems will be dismissed as artistic ignorance.\n\nIn lieu of examining Spector's actual case and what it says about the American legal system, the film prefers to meditate on what HBO calls \"the nature of celebrity\" and how it contributed to the supposed framing of Spector. There are long stretches in which former pals, lawyers and the defendant himself muse on the larger reasons for the injustice.\n\n\"It's called envy,\" Pacino-as-Spector says. \"Extraordinary accomplishments ... transform the grateful into an audience and the envious into a mob.\"\n\nOur culture's relationship with fame is ripe for comment, but it's unclear why Mamet chose Spector as his vehicle. When his case first went to trial in 2007, Spector hadn't produced a hit in decades and was less a celebrity than a tricky Jeopardy! question.\n\nProspective jurors couldn't envy him because they had no clue who he was -- a reality the film acknowledges, then conveniently forgets in reaching its broader point about strange artists and fair trials. It's a highly questionable assertion, given the acquittals of Robert Blake and Michael Jackson in the years leading up to Spector's trials.\n\nIn shoving Spector's case into an ill-fitting argument, so much of what made his case fascinating is lost."}

{"text":"This might be the saddest, darkest film I've ever seen. From the people who made Watership Down (which I still haven't gotten around to), an animated British film from the 80's about two horribly abused dogs that escape from a military test center and make their way through the English countryside while their former captors hunt them down.\n\nThe animation is haunting and beautiful, at times terrifying. There are images in this film that you will never get out of your head.\n\nNot a kid's film either. It's not an adult cartoon, in that its not filled with T&A or gratuitous violence (though it does get very violent at times). But had I seen this movie when I was a kid it would have wrecked me for months, rather than just for a weeks like I assume it will now.\n\nThis also has amazing character development, and goes in places you just do not expect, no matter how much you steel yourself going in. The two main characters are amongst the most sympathetic hero's ever put to film, especially if your a dog person ( I work with dogs, so yeah...fuck me...).\n\nIt's on Netflix instant, and I highly recommend it, and even though its actually depressing, and not just melancholy, its also deeply riveting and probably the most intelligent animated film I've ever seen (and I'm not trying to diminish animated films--but even the transcendent ones are rarely this mature).\n\nPS. The opening credit's song sets the tone for this film as good as any I can think of before or since.\n\nI just watched this again as well. It was mentioned in the Netflix Instant thread, I think. Anyway, I read the book about 20 years ago or so, and could only remember that it was extremely sad without recalling details. Then that scene right at the beginning with Rowf in the tank reminded me of just how depressing the movie was going to getA great film. I actually saw this when I was a kid and it has probably the saddest ending to a film ever. I actually think it's better than Watership Down. Dammit... just thinking about that ending makes me want to cry.\n\nUpon re-watching, I actually think the ending isn't quite as downbeat or even ambiguous as it seems at first. The first time you watch it, the fact that everything is so bleak and doesn't end on a happy note, kind of colors the way you look at it (at least it did for me). But seeing it again, the island does show up as the credits roll, and the song is a pretty happy one. Although it doesn't resolve what happens to them, really, I think it heavily suggests they at least make it to land.\n\nAt least, I really, really need to believe that.\n\nAlso, the final voice overs of the humans in that scene seems to suggest that b\/c of all the bad publicity, they're closing down the research facilityYeah, but I don't view WD as a total downer....after all, Hazel passes away at a ripe old age after leading the warren to safety and defeating Efrafra.\n\nWhile it's intense (I had to rewind after I saw them all-but-come-and-say that Woundwart's soldiers got, er, conjugal privileges), it isn't the total soul-crushing that The Plague Dogs is. When the lone friendly human they meet accidentally gets his face blown off, it would sink a lesser film. Here, it's just another scoop of horrible on these dogs' livesPoor fucking fox...\n\nPS: They totally drown, Z.Vasquez.\n\nYou're a bad man.\n\nAnd yeah, love the Todd. It's great because you totally expect him to betray them, but he never does. He just helps them every step of the way, and eventually his goodness is rewarded with death. It's like The Wire, but animated and with talking animals.\n\nETA: I've heard the book actually has an all-out happy ending.\n\nBy the way, I'd love to read some of those articles. There's a real lack of coverage for this film out there.\n\nIt's not really 'coverage' (and I realize I'm implying I actually read the book in what I wrote).

Stephen Baldwin as McManus, Benicio Del Toro as Fesnter, Kevin Pollack as Hockney and Gabriel Byrne as Keaton are just 4 incredible performances, along with Spacey's they are probably the best acting a cast has performed in a film, it was just incredible.

{"text":"Review: 'My Life So Far' is barely there\n\n(CNN) -- Hugh Hudson's \"My Life So Far\" is a well-meaning, amiable little movie you've seen maybe 30 times before, even if you've never seen it. This is one of those \"I grew up in an eccentric family\" testimonials in which a man reminisces in voice-over as we watch him cavort through his idealized childhood.\n\n\"My Life So Far\" is set on an estate in Scotland, but it could take place in Bora-Bora and it would contain the same string of characters and the same life-defining \"wacky\" situations.\n\nStory-wise, you get a pinch of everything, from the starry-eyed vision of childhood in \"Hope and Glory\" to the obsession with aviation and budding sexuality of \"The World According to Garp.\" The characters are also exactly what you're expecting. There's even a sage old grandma whose death engenders the collapse of the family.\n\nIt's likely that none of the similarities are intentional, since the narrative is based on a memoir (\"Son of Adam\") by British television honcho Sir Denis Forman.\n\nBut Hudson's film never manages to make an appearance. It's like he's cooking something up in the other room; it smells pretty good, but you'll just have to imagine the meal. And, for a movie that's supposed to deal with big human emotions, it's benign to a fault. There's nothing here to hate, but you'd have to work pretty hard to fall in love with it.\n\nNothin' says lovin' ...\n\nRobert Norman stars as Fraser Pettigrew, the little tyke who leads us through his supposedly eventful formative years. Fraser and his family live on a beautiful estate owned by his wealthy grandmother, Gamma (Rosemary Harris). Fraser's father, Edward (Colin Firth), is viewed as a bit of a nut by Gamma and his stiff-upper-lip brother, Morris (Malcolm McDowell).\n\nRich-but-practical Morris would be pleased if Edward could come up with a better income-generating scheme than the one he's currently wasting his time on, namely digging up moss around the estate and selling it by the bag full. It doesn't make the family much money, plus it ruins the grounds.\n\nEdward is always building crazy things like a paddle-driven flotation device and an underground chimney that funnels smoke away from his peat-processing plant. If that doesn't make you fall over in hysterics, you can bet nothing else in the movie will, outside of a couple of innocently sexual one-liners from the oblivious Fraser. There's also a nail-biting curling match for sports enthusiasts.\n\nNothing much happens for quite a while, including an unexpected visit from a barnstorming French biplane pilot (Tch\u00e9cky Karyo). Don't' be concerned if you're wondering why the pilot shows up, makes eyes at Fraser's sister, then flies away without her. It's all clarified later on when he shows up again, makes eyes again, and flies away again.\n\nIt seems like half of what happens is included for its \"whimsical\" nature (the sight of a plane unexpectedly dropping out of the sky), rather than for any constructive purpose. Even the pivotal event of the story, when Edward falls for his brother's pretty fianc\u00e9e, Heloise (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob), plays for its entirety as if it's just getting started.\n\nTo begin with, Heloise as written is hardly enticing enough to make an apparently happy man turn his back on his loving wife (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, for some reason.) There aren't any big scenes between Firth and Mastrantonio before Jacob shows up, so you have no reason to suspect that Pop might want to stray. You can't even tell that the newcomer is affecting Edward, outside of his being happy to show a pretty woman around the estate and brag about his lame-brained inventions.\n\nHeloise just smiles a lot and playfully throws peat at Fraser, but it's somehow enough to turn Edward into a complete ninny. He pouts and slouches around like a 6-year-old after Heloise rebuffs his attempt to kiss her.\n\nIn the end, it all amounts to very little, and that's being generous. This is the least crazy movie you could ever hope to see about people who are trumpeted as oddballs.\n\nThere's no bad language in \"My Life So Far,\" and no actual nudity. You do get to see some erotic etchings that Fraser discovers in the attic, and he makes a few remarks about the history of prostitution at the dinner table. Look in your encyclopedia under \"Who cares?\" Rated PG-13. 93 minutes."}

William James in \"Hurt Locker.\" (Summit Entertainment)\n\nIn \"The Hurt Locker,\" the captivating new film by Kathryn Bigelow, a clock is always ticking, an explosion of some kind is always only moments away, death and danger are constant companions.\n\nOddly enough, they're welcome companions for Staff Sgt. William James (the terrific Jeremy Renner, in what should be a career-making turn). James is addicted to the adrenaline of war, and he's certainly found the right job for scoring his daily rush.\n\nJames is part of a bomb squad working in the Iraq War. He comes to his new partners -- played by Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty -- after they've seen the devastation a bomb can cause, and then proceeds to terrify them with his cowboy ways. It's mad enough that he puts himself in harm's way just for the fun of it, but he's also putting them in danger.\n\nBigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal aren't really offering up a standard story here, a dramatic progression that arcs and releases. Instead, they're simply following these three soldiers as they try to survive a nasty desert war punctuated with bombs built into cars, bombs left along a roadside, bombs placed inside human corpses.\n\nAs with most war films there's a countdown toward the day the men will get to go home that hangs like an ax over their heads. Pull one wrong wire and that day never comes.\n\nIt's tense stuff well tendered and the ever-macho Bigelow (\"Point Break\") is just the woman to explore such dark and sweaty corners. But in the end, the adrenaline addiction is somewhat self-explanatory and a bit limiting dramatically.\n\nThe question isn't how do you live with the buzz of looming death; it's how do you live without it?

{"text":"How does a moviemaker legitimately portray the life of a great artist? The question is in the air these days with the release of \"Anonymous,\" which posits Shakespeare as a nincompoop fraud, and now Philipp St\u00f6lzl's \"Young Goethe in Love,\" which turns one of the greatest geniuses of German literature into a love-struck rapscallion.\n\nIn Germany, the film's country of origin, it was simply titled \"Goethe!\" (I've always made it a point to be wary of movies with exclamation points in the title.) The title change in English is obviously meant to remind us of \"Shakespeare in Love,\" but the resemblance ends there. Despite its strenuous attempts at levity, not to mention high literacy, it's an earthbound and prosaic piece of filmmaking.\n\nYoung Goethe (Alexander Fehling, from \"Inglourious Basterds\") wants to be a famous playwright and poet, but his output is mediocre and his work habits are worse. Flunking his bar exams in 1772, he is sent by his autocratic father (Henry H\u00fcbchen) to the rural town of Wetzlar where he unhappily toils as a clerk at a county court under the Teutonic eye of ambitious prosecutor Albert Kestner (Moritz Bleibtreu). Goethe and Kestner end up pals, but that's before it's discovered that both are vying for the fetchingly giddy Lotte (Miriam Stein), whose widower father (Burghardt Klaussner) is angling to marry her off to the wealthy prosecutor.\n\nOut of all this hoo-ha comes \"The Sorrows of Young Werther,\" Goethe's novella about a suicidally love-stricken romantic that made his reputation just in the nick of time. It was a huge seller, although the movie neglects to mention that Goethe's name did not initially appear on it, and because of copyright laxities, he didn't earn a great deal from its success."}
{"text":"The family drama is an all too familiar genre, but add dark humor, murder and incest to the mix and it makes for a fun, demented thriller. In \"Stoker,\" Korean director Chan-wook Park teeters between art and vulgarity. While the script from Wentworth Miller (\"Prison Break\") needs to be fleshed out more, I couldn't look away while watching the events unfold, much like a horrific car accident.\n\nIndia's father (Dermot Mulroney) dies on her 18th birthday, leaving India (Mia Wasikowska) alone with her icy mother, Evelyn (Nicole Kidman). On the day of her father's funeral, India meets Uncle Charles (Matthew Goode) for the first time. Evelyn invites Charles to stay with them, despite India's protestations. On the surface, Charles has the best intentions. Regardless, India's suspicions about her uncle loom. Over time, her suspicions evolve into an infatuation, and they share an intimate moment that awakens the real India.\n\nHalf of the fun of \"Stoker\" is its big reveal near the end, which is why I won't go into too much detail about the plot. Still, Park's directing skills, specifically how he plays with sound, color and texture, is reason enough to go see the movie. It's unsettling to watch India glide a hard-boiled egg across the table and hear it's shell slowly cracking, as if were the sound of bones being crushed. Sound plays a crucial role in \"Stoker,\" and it's the most blatant similarity between India and Charles. Their shared hypersensitivity unites them and forces India to accept her true nature, something her father tried to suppress. Interestingly, it's never made clear just how close India and her father were, but Evelyn's resentment towards her husband as well as India implies the unthinkable.\n\nMulroney and Kidman give solid performances, but it's Goode and Wasikowska that stand out. Goode was perfectly cast as the handsome stranger. In addition to being incredibly good-looking, Goode possesses an innate charm. Like Goode, Charles is charismatic, which makes it difficult for Evelyn or India to see through to his ulterior motives. I've liked Wasikowska ever since I saw her in \"The Kids are All Right.\" And while India's wardrobe resembles Wednesday's from \"The Addams Family,\" Wasikowska's tenacity and intelligence reminds me of her role as Jane Eyre in \"Jane Eyre.\" Largely due to Wasikowska's performance, I both feared and admired India.\n\nMiller creates a compelling story with rich characters and unexpected plot twists. Unfortunately, the writing stumbles through a few scenes. India's motives are not always made clear. And while I might not fully understand the meaning behind \"Stoker,\" I got a kick out of seeing Park and the actors experiment with the material."}

That's better than bad! Liam Marple (Robson Green), a shiftless, conscience-free, tabloid newspaper hack, meets and falls in love with Laura Bowden, England's troubled female Prime Minister (Caroline Goodall). Their romance is destined, as the PM says, to \"end in tears,\" and the script's twists and turns kept me guessing as to whether the leads would get together or not.\n\nViewers of Hollywood movies assume right up front that romantic comedy leads end up together, but this is a British movie, and the Brits gave the world boiled beef and soggy vegetables, and they are not afraid to tack a tear jerker ending onto a romance; that's certainly happened in Masterpiece Theater before. So ... you really can't be sure till the final frame what will happen.\n\nWhatever charisma is, Robson Green has it. You can't take your eyes off of him. I can't nail down what it is -- in some shots he looks hideous, while in others, he looks matin\u00e9e-idol, or romance-novel-cover-model, handsome. He's always compelling.\n\nSome viewers said that the film seemed \"unbelievable.\" I beg to differ. \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" is worth watching for a scene, early on, where Liam asks Laura to dance. The heat they generate while dancing is remarkable. And neither is much of a dancer. It's entirely believable that any woman with a pulse, finding such powerful chemistry in the arms of a stranger, would take great risks to pursue the relationship.\n\nCaroline Goodall, though, was never believable to me as the Prime Minister. She did not convey power, competence, or passion for a cause. Rather, she appeared afraid, coquettish, or snippy, by turns. She would make a great career woman, but this isn't a career woman; it's a leader of the free world.\n\nOh, for a performance such as Katherine Hepburn was able to give -- to convey power, passion for a cause, and sexiness, all at the same time. Or Audrey Hepburn, in, for example, \"The Nun's Story,\" or Rosalind Russell, in \"His Girl Friday.\" Too, the script is a bit muddled. Any movie with three separate endings is going on too long and not doing so very gracefully.\n\nFor all its imperfections, though, \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" is worth viewing for romantic comedy fans.

{"text":"**\nHere is what you can suss out from the trailer for Charlie Saint Cloud: Young Charlie is a sailor and good student bound for success until the car accident that nearly kills him takes the life of his younger brother. Emotionally destroyed, he retreats to a simple life in his oceanside town, where he's still able to see his brother's ghost every evening, and they play baseball. This arrangement works well until Charlie meets a beautiful young sailor (a lady sailor, that is-- sorry, half of Zac Efron's fanbase) who is planning to take her boat on an around-the-world trip. He wants to go with her, but he fears that if he leaves he won't be able to see his ghost brother anymore. When she gets lost at sea, Charlie has to decide between his past and his future, between the memory of his brother and the possibility of opening himself up to a new relationship.\n\nThere's about ten minutes of actual movie left after that, so if you've seen the trailer and have a pretty good guess as to which avenue Charlie is going to choose, you can probably stay home. Why buy the cow when you can watch the shitty movie for free?\n\nWhat the film's trailer doesn't account for, however, is its sheer weirdness, which is somewhat endearing.\n\nTeen dreamboat turned regular dreamboat Efron plays Charlie as a kind of haunted hunk, which isn't particularly credible, but at least he extends beyond surface-level sadness. Since the accident, which left him clinically dead for crucial seconds, he has established some sort of bond with the afterlife, one that allows him to see and speak to ghosts who inhabit the graveyard where he works. Not a lot of ghosts, or very often, or according to any real internal logic-- why can he see some people occasionally, yet his brother every day, yet potentially not be able to see his brother ever again if he misses a single appointment of pitch-and-catch?-- but enough that it skews his perspective on the living.\n\nCharlie is rattled out of his doldrums both by the beautiful sailor girl (the very tolerable Amanda Crew, a young Kate Beckinsale type) and by a visit from Florio (Ray Liotta), the paramedic who revived him after the crash. Florio is himself dying of cancer, and is eager to both impart his dying wisdom to Charlie, and also to explicitly verbalize the movie's squishy themes about fate and destiny and true love.\n\nOn paper Charlie Saint Cloud sounds like another melodrama off the Nicholas Sparks Melodrama Assembly Line; it's got a quaint community bordering water, starcrossed young lovers, the black cloud of a family tragedy, and the looming inevitability of a thematically clarifying catastrophe. But director Burr Steers elevates it, if only a little, above drek like The Last Song with a superior sense of pacing, a (relatively) better visual aesthetic, and a dedication to the movie's weird ghost premise.\n\nSteers's previous two films are the Catcher in the Rye knockoff Igby Goes Down and his first collaboration with Zac the Dreamy, Seventeen Again. He's yet to distinguish himself or settle into anything resembling a style, but Charlie Saint Cloud splits the difference between the dimestore artiness of Igby and the blatant commercial appeal of Seventeen Again. He's made three movies so far, none of them good, but there's a hint of promise there that's a little too nagging to ignore.\n\nSpeaking of promise, Efron does a passable job. The role demands more than he can give, but he does have a real onscreen presence, and his range certainly extends far beyond that of his peers, notably the stiff vampires and charisma-free werewolves of Twilight. He's still better suited to light comedy, but there may come a day when he can do something interesting with a potentially meatier role. Ten years from now, perhaps he and Steers can reunite for a movie that's more of an unqualified success."}

Walter Salles took on the challenge, and his background in road movies certainly helps, but there are some x-factors here to be sure.\n\nSam Riley sounds appropriately gruff and wandering in voice over in the new trailer, but the movie will also be a test of whether Garrett Hedlund and Kristen Stewart can really act or if they can only chew gum and walk.\n\nCheck it out for yourself:\n\nWhat's striking here is that the look of the project isn't aggressively indicative of the period.

Just indulging the idea that there is such a thing as good or bad people as opposed to a whole spectrum of ambiguity.' So I feel very conscious about that when I make a film, that nobody's a hero and nobody's a villain. My experience of human beings is that\u2026 that we're complicated people.\n\n\u2014Sarah Polley, on the moralizing that goes on in films, courtesy of this great piece by hitfix.(via casualsplendor)"}

A fictional take on a real-life tragedy, it includes mass murder and suicide. In addition to the violence, there are a few brief moments of frank sexuality and a bit of strong language (\"s--t,\" one \"f--k\"), though it's not very frequent.\n\nFamilies can talk about how the media depicts the pressures of school and academics. Do you think it's realistic? How are the pressures different between high school and college (or, as in this case, postgraduate work)? How do the issues that Liu is facing compare to the ones that have led teenagers to violent acts in high schools? Can you think of other movies that deal with similar themes or topics?\n\nThe good stuff\n\nMessages: Streep's character is a well-off, well-intentioned woman whose interest in Chinese culture is portrayed as the vague affection of a silly tourist. Quinn's character takes advantage of his Chinese students; some of the students attend a church group, but it's clear they're only there for the snacks and social events; one of the students also steals cable. Quinn's character blocks his student's academic progress out of anger and spite.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nViolence: A Western shootout fantasy sequence features \"shooting\" but no blood; there are also four realistic graphic murders, and a character commits suicide.\n\nSex: A sexual encounter in a crowded rental flat is shielded by a blanket but still audible to the other residents; characters watch scrambled pornography and discuss the nature of female orgasm; brief shot of a naked back. A conference is described as featuring \"Free booze, good food and beautiful -- albeit high-strung -- women.\" Chinese characters discuss the rumor that American teens are \"doing it\" by age 13. A scene between Streep and Liu has a sensually charged undertone.\n\nLanguage: Language includes \"bulls--t,\" \"s--t,\" one non-sexual use of \"f--k,\" and \"bastard.\" A poorly translated toast comes out as \"up the bottoms"}
{"text":"Hotel Rwanda\n\nMovies like this leave my mind reeling with questions.\nNot just the usual ones brought on by the horror of mankind's actions, those questions made pointedly by bodies on the road as far as he can see, speedbumps on a 'cleared road' (cleared of the living). How could anyone do this, to be so consumed by hatred or anger that the normal restraints are completely absent.\n\nOr the big questions like what makes people so different in their response to horror that some risk their lives repeatedly to help while others give in to what looks like mass hysteria and hack up their neighbors? And of course the personalization of that question in: given the same situation how would i react?\n\nWe have seen the main pieces over and over again since the British concentration camps for the Boer women and children in 1899, the Armenia genocide with its thousands perishing in the desert or lost in harem sexual exploitation for a lifetime. The destruction of Yugoslavia in an orgasm of violence, rape hotels and the eventual partitioning of history and geography back 50 years. It has happened so many times, in so many places that we get emotional callouses over our hearts to protect us from the immediate horror of it all. But the survivors, they will never heal, will never have the luxury of developing a hard heart to the evils of mankind. They will never close their eyes without reliving the nightmare.\n\nBut after all these questions have settled down to a dull aching roar, i am left with the idea that to honor, to remember these dead is to strive to keep it from happening again. To understand how such things erupt in our midst, to think about the warning signs and to struggle to push the powers that rule to build strike forces or international police forces or what ever it takes so that this evil leaves our midst forever. The radio in the background, urging violence, dehumanizing \"The Other\" into cockroaches, making great divisions where there were little to none before (nose width???) certainly is significant. Mob violence, herd mentality explains part, but what about that man on the radio, or more importantly the few leaders behind the masks of evil, who are they and how did society create them. And more importantly, how do we keep trash thought from rising to the surface of society and causing this? I see the same kind of racism, the same kind of demonization of others, of the cockroachizition in the decline of dialogue into nothing more than utter polarization and namecalling around me."}

{"text":"Film Review: Hanna\n\nIf they gave out oscars for Most Style Points, Joe Wright, Director of \"Hanna\" would be the frontrunner right now. He has crafted a movie that's colorful and boyant and scary and joyfully weird. It's a film student masterpiece. A technical A++.\n\nBut all the artistry in the world is for nought if the story falls short. And in Hanna\u2026you guessed it\u2026the story falls short.\n\nTo be sure, it's not terrible. The premise is good. A young girl, Hanna, trained to be a killing machine by her father, is let loose in the world. We meet an especially unlikable CIA agent who is to be the target of Hanna's killing skills.\n\nThe trailers lied to us about this movie. It's not a \"little girl as Jason Bourne\" type film. Even though there are some pretty spectacular sequences employing the skills of Saoirse Ronan's character. As well as a particularly memorable fight scene with Eric Bana and five nameless goons. But this is really a sort of coming of age story, about a girl who is discovering the world for the first time. And Joe Wright films it that way. Through the eyes, and ears of a child. Everything is curiously wonderful, or scary. Hanna is on her own for the first time. She meets her first friends, almost has her first kiss, learns new truths about people and her own childhood. It's engaging enough, but definitely short on action. If you came to see Hanna kick a lot of butt, you won't be completely satisfied.\n\nThe performances are very good. Standouts include Cate Blanchett as the evil CIA agent. She devastatingly assured of herself, and has dismissed compassion to hide her secrets and get her job done. Jessica Barden, a young English actress turns in a surprisingly funny and effective performance as Hanna's new, very straight forward, promiscuous friend. And of course, Ms. Ronan herself, who is pitch perfect and consistant every scene.\n\nThe problem isn't that the film is billed as an action film when it's really a film with some action in it. And the problem isn't that it's shot like an art film. It's that the plot is really paper thin. We never learn why any of this had to happen. We never get enough from the story to have a strong emotional connection to the characters motives. Sometimes they act contradictory to what we've learned about them. Most of the time, they just do stuff they have to do, because the story says they have to do it. The storytelling is adept enough, that we can go along for the ride and trust that we'll get the answers we need. And we keep waiting for more enlightenment, then the movie is suddenly over.\n\nThere are instances when a movie needs not explain everything. Sometimes, a film is more effective when it leaves you with unanswered questions to think about. But Hanna leaves us with questions, I'm quite sure it doesn't have the answer to. Questions the filmmakers may not have thought about, and we weren't intended to be asking. Hanna leaves us unsatisfied. It's a great looking and great sounding film. A lot of stuff happens. But a lot of stuff happening does not a story make. Grade: C+"}
{"text":"Lawless is an articulate and powerful film that lives and breathes in the specificity of performance, burns bright in the living and dying of personal ambition and the collateral damages in its name. Driven by a talented cast, a masterful director and brilliant screenwriter, this is and isn't just a gangster film, just as it isn't burdened with the limitations of 'based on a true story', and thankfully, quite purposefully it is artfully inspired. Mostly it is, simply put, a crafted cacophony of moment in time and place that goes beyond the experience of historical dramas and genre flicks, resonating, however fleetingly in the hours and days of our lives with the thrill that comes from movies made by and for adults. The joy of a good R rated film is that we can find something real to connect to, even against our inevitable differences, drawn from the truth of happening when all the movie constellations line up to form something special, something lasting that we can't wait to find again, watch another time, share. I admit I imagined greatness from Lawless, the gold mine from the repeat union of John Hillcoat and Nick Cave that gave us the unique landscape outback of an Australian Western (The Proposition). Right away I knew this film would have appealed to Sergio Leone. Of course we lost Leone in 89\u2032 and therefore can only speculate on what he might have to say, but certainly the demi-god of Westerns would enjoy Hillcoat's fascination with the eternity of moments. Surely the lover and master of Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne would celebrate the resounding crescendo formed from Hillcoat's juxtaposition of extreme close-ups and far away shots snapped as if perched on the hand of god, broiled by Leone's unforgiving sun. Leone, like Hillcoat are fond of the surety of performance, not the value of computer effect or how to best cover up deadpan performances with a series of shots. It is the language of Hillcoat's obsessions and his direction of Nick Cave's script that gives breath as breath is taken, the way smiles soften a harsh reality, give birth to shared darkness. Lawless seems to take us back in time or at least to another place less obscured with the big floppy hats of blockbuster films replaced with the dirty faced children of Prohibition-era Franklin County, Virginia gawking at guns and cars and beautiful men and women.\n\nYou can feel the world of this film without a lot of attention placed on it to constantly dazzle you. It exudes the warmth of a settling dusty road, the battered smile of a damaged woman, the smell of a hay-field collecting young love. This way the actors are allowed to disappear altogether, absorbed in a way and replaced with the personalities of the story. Lots of films rely on rigid archetypes that make such freedoms almost impossible where the bad guys have to be bad all the time, wear dark like capes and Fedoras without much room for acting. Hillcoat's tutelage offers a balanced mix of executable actions and moments born in the moments. These characters are wrought from air and reflections, complexions colored from emotions found and made to burn up as the theater smolders in their every rung out glance and grimace. It doesn't matter where we're going, we just want to enjoy the ride and we do. The unencumbered plot is to a Hillcoat film as laden exposition is to a Christopher Nolan albatross, worlds of difference tempered in the moments. Whereby Inception explains the action, The Proposition frames it, nourishes it, the latter winning over the other even if popular opinion prefers the former for now. Perhaps we'll see the difference more clearly later, after we come to our senses. Grand films consume all by overload, stifling the senses but destined to fade, leaving a hole where its bloated belly had been, the comic effect of ridiculous patterned from caricature that just doesn't stick with us over time. What's the difference between Bale's Batman and George Clooney's? Nipples? The raspy voice? Internal films know no such flaws, the taxing done inside where our guts and bones share space, returning to remind us that believable feels real. It is why the most prestigious awards are given out to the films that most aptly capture our living fantasies. Sure, there are plenty of fodder trophies and manufactured accomplishments but like bowling mementos they collect the most dust and inevitably wear out their usefulness, destined for thrift shops where nobody knows the names on the plaques.\n\nLawless makes no apologies for being a character film. The fact that it has been criticized for not having a point, suggesting somehow that stuff has to happen in a certain grand way in order to qualify as a big screen story is ridiculous. The fact that Roger Ebert's movie reviews have been declining in years suggests there is more to his missing the merits of this film than his mere abhorrence of the violence, revealing instead that he's lost his objectivity due to cavities from so many PG13 movies he's preferred. In light of his appreciation of The Proposition I won't write him off entirely just yet. In the case of this film, plot serves characters individually and collectively in their relationships, crimes and misdemeanors. Plot moves chronologically forward but only insofar as we remain roughly in the vicinity of the story. No flash backs, no flash forwards or old men telling us about the adventures of their youth, etc. There is a certain bookend effect, such that we are told in a way to wrap things up things that happen down the road. But this is necessary closure, it is what is known as the denouement or \"the final outcome of the main dramatic complication in a literary work\". Plot is what happens to tell story within the given time frame of your typical movie but more often than not a film relies almost entirely on the stuff happening, less about story and even less about characters. These 'concept driven' films are often blockbusters, comic book movies and fantasy films often fall into this concept, and by all rights it is clear that character films are just not in the same neighborhood and they are better because of it. Anthropomorphic cars, jeeps, planes and trains from another planet that team together to help save the planet, show them joining forces, fighting, winning, and saying goodbye until the next invasion force is what it is and Lawless doesn't even want to be that. Stuff happens in order to arrive at the inevitable conclusion, planet Earth saved another day, but what is the story and who are the characters? Lawless establishes time, place and relationships first, than plot moves us forward but never independently, never solely for effect. Most people aren't going to mistakenly sit down to watch this film and mix it up with Transformers so complaining that Lawless isn't more like giant walking and fighting cars is a little silly.\n\nLawless focuses on the lives of the Bondurant brothers, Jack, Forrest and Howard who were moonshiners and outlaws who became heroes when the law became criminals back during Prohibition. The brothers were locked together and their destiny interwoven. A story about one of them could only fully be told by including all of them. The main character is Jack, growing up the little brother in the shadow of his brothers, already larger than life and steeped in mystery, struggling to scratch out from under so much reputation and lore. He just wants to live but he cannot, all hope for a little more youth burned up in the fire of wicked men, lawlessness and ambition. If we are to believe criminals can be heroes and the meek can do right by desire to be better alone, then Lawless goes beyond portraiture, never succumbing to the ills of caricature, tapping into our own personal and collective histories. If the film suffers at all it is that is succeeds so well at creating the world of the story that we hate to see it end, desperate to hold on a little longer, draw in a little more reckless abandon.\n\nIt is true, the film plods at time, caught up in capturing moments too long, allowing us a way into the history of Americana at the expense of larger than life Hollywood grandeur. There are no bustling green screen city scapes, no wild action porn or bare knuckle car chases beyond what could have happened and probably did. The tires on the cars in the movie never completely break possible, always held together with the glue of probable. Gun battles rage but people are not immune to the red-red blood of death and dying. We are spared the atrociousness of a PG13 rating, the horrors of dumb, dumber and dumberer storytelling. The scenes are propelled forward by dirty hands and sweat stained faces, bloody holes and voracious appetites. Hillcoat does not spend much time in the bedroom or belabor torture, the ghastly is held in candle light and impromptu calamity, extreme violence that is considerably more effective held back a little, given the chance for us to make much more out of it in our own experiences. The film moves by character actions, not the action of characters and this is challenging to many who would prefer it the other way in order to justify long drawn out scenes like vans held in the seconds flying off a bridge or the same 8 minutes of airplane crash rewound and played back over and over and over again. Hillcoat prefers the internal happenings of men and women to their counterparts, the events of history as portrayed by stuff taking place, bridges erected only to burn them down, prisons with the purpose of place instead of a place for character, a place holder for genuineness, blossoming togetherness torn apart by the greed, ambition and evil.\n\nLovingly photographed and artfully designed, Lawless takes great pains to get the setting right, to compose shots that give life to shadows and frames to ordinary countrysides, small towns and family homes. Cinematographer Benoit Delhomme (The Merchant of Venice, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, The Proposition) is certain to give Hillcoat the canvas for his imagining, to always keep the camera out of the business of the story, enhancing what is there not the way we see it \u2013 like avoiding shaking the camera for effect, moving the camera in ways that break all reality, manufacture performance. It is a rare treat to be invited into a movie for a change, given the opportunity to settle in time and place, allowed to engage and be engaged. Lawless is not revolutionary by design, it does not invent new techniques or tell a story we have not heard in one way or another before. It does not pretend to be something beyond the story and characters portrayed, it does not answer questions or write history any more than right the wrongs of perception, prejudice or expectations. What it does well, where it exceeds the limitations of so many films that set out to tell a story with characters we can relate to, is that it captures so effortlessly the mood and sentiment of an era where the law and criminals were sometimes on opposite sides of the people, a time when what is right and what is wrong cannot be manufactured or broken or upheld because it should be but rather because our actions make them so and they are right in the living of them. Historical dramas about actual people are challenging insofar as there are certain guidelines that must not be broken, just as there are certain matters of fact that have to be part of the telling of the tale. In the case of actual persons who lived a certain way and died in the living of those ways, it is hard to imagine a better cast of actors living so fully and with such certainty of performance that we are reminded of the power of the cinema to explore, to confirm and to unsettle all our preconceived ideas and feelings in order to enjoy ordinary, aspire for more and live our own joys of misdemeanors and accomplishments.\n\nRelated articles, the bits and brambles..6 Responses to Lawless (2012)\n\nAwesome review! Lawless felt like a breath of old fashioned air amidst the usual Hollywood fair. The characters were flawed and sometimes even detestable, and in that way I found this film to be very human. People don't always get amazing lines \u2013 sometimes they just grunt it out like Forrest.\n\nHey Livi \u2014 Thanks for the kind words. I knew the film was going to be special when I firs saw the trailer. I kicked myself for not seeing it in theaters, then again it was great watching it at home so I could watch it again before returning the rental! \"..breath of old fashioned air..\" nice way of putting it. Good, true character work still wins out over all the green screens and computer manufactured drama in the world \u2013 at least for those who can tell the difference and appreciate it. Tom Hardy was born to make movies like this. He reminded me of Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, De Niro, Brando..steeped in the method, drawn out over the fires of performance. Yes, the primal grunts and scrapings are sometimes all that is needed or wanted..\n\nI think it's out of time, out of place amid the clutter of overdone, these super fantastical comic book movies and fantasy farces that have replaced character and story with concepts, spectacle and grand illusions. Computer effects and green screen shenanigans have become the absolute norm, not the summer blockbuster du jour but the matter of expected everything. It's a shame when such performance driven, character specific stories come along that burn so very bright in talent, realism and personality. Actors live for these films while making the others, while filling bank accounts with forgettable in order to breathe, bleed and believe in films like Lawless. Hillcoat and Cave give me reason to keep going to the theater.\n\nI agree with everything you said pretty much. All kinds of films are cool when done well and with a bit of hard. But so often in the kind of films you mention, a half arsed, money grabbing route is taken"}

{"text":"Jean-Pierre Melville\n\n\"The fatalism is certainly there. The stoicism rears its head at times.

Yet, there's also a lack of deep-set purpose in these men when compared to Melville's characters later on. Individual ethics are less isolated and not such an obvious focus as in the other films.\" (Le Doulos)\n\n\"Since Melville peddles in tragedy as much as he does character-oriented crime tales, the expectations for the protagonist's future should be limited, but if you're watching intently then you're probably in his corner to a certain extent.

They neither beg for attention nor affection. They are singularly concerned with performing a task. Emotions, while being hinted at and thus present on some level, are shrugged off in favor of a job, an existence. It's not just the professionalism to admire, but the focus and confidence that preparation will lead to the proper fate. Not success, necessarily. Not even continued life.

The priest and the woodcutter are recounting the story of a murdered samurai whose body the woodcutter discovered three days earlier in a forest grove. Both were summoned to testify at the murder trial, the priest who ran into the samurai and his wife traveling through the forest just before the murder occurred. Three other people who testified at the trial are supposedly the only direct witnesses: a notorious bandit named Taj\u00f4maru, who allegedly murdered the samurai and raped his wife; the white veil cloaked wife of the samurai; and the samurai himself who testifies through the use of a medium.

The woodcutter reveals at Rash\u00f4mon that he knows more than he let on at the trial, thus bringing into question his own actions.

{"text":"Wow, that was certainly an experience. I haven't seen many of Lars von Trier's other movies, only Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves, but I've seen enough to feel like I know what to expect (and I learned about him and the Dogme 95 movement in film school). Even so, this movie blew my expectations out of the water.\n\nDogville makes it clear from its opening scene that it doesn't care about a mainstream audience. My wife didn't watch more than 5 minutes before quitting. This was most likely because it lacks a traditional set, using what I would call instead a symbolic set. That places it into a more avant-garde or experimental camp. The entire story takes place in the town of Dogville, and its entire contents are laid out on a soundstage. Chalk lines on the ground demarcate the different buildings, and the only set pieces laid out on top of it are the pieces that bear some function in the story. I've never seen anything else like it.\n\nThis choice, combined with the voiceover narration, and its division into chapters makes the movie feel very much like a storybook. It also has symbolic meaning, as well. There are no walls, because each person knows every other one's business. You can't see anything outside the town, because the story focuses on the town itself. You never see the doors (though you hear them) because they don't matter. You do see their clothes, and certain set pieces, because they add character (and realistically, they have to wear something).\n\nThe story has it's charms, and kept me engaged throughout, although because it's a Lars von Trier movie, I had certain inklings about where it was going. His films excel at creating uneasiness. The ending, for me, ties it all together. I would never spoil it, but let me say it's a very unique happy ending."}

Cyrus' goal was to reunite every gang in order to \"take over the city\" (what exactly for, is anybody's guess).\n\nJust as the Warriors try to escape from the law, they are unknowingly framed for that murder which means they must make their way across the entire city in order to reach the safe haven of their Coney Island turf -- where oddly enough, they can feel safe, but first, they have to pass through the territories of several gangs as the constant presence of \"the voice\" (a semi-depicted woman who narrates the night's occurrences on the radio as if such were a sporting event) \"spreads the word\" that leads the various avenging gangs into a collision course with the title heroes. It would have probably helped the Warriors, and certainly the police, if they had occasionally listened to this particular radio station but let's remember we are talking about pre-internet, pre-cell phone, pre-a-lot-of-things times (though clearly, not pre-portable radios).\n\n\"The Warriors\" was obviously shot in real New York City locations and it depicts the city and its subway system at its bleakest, dirtiest and most violent, hardly the stuff that could ever encourage outsiders to try it (I know it made me want to avoid it for years). Like \"American Graffiti,\" \"Eyes Wide Shut\" and the \"24\" TV series, this is also one of those features in which the action takes place throughout the night and until the sun's dawn which was clearly the right decision as these characters simply wouldn't have looked right in plain daylight, curious though how, much as in these other examples, they make it through the night without having to take a nap or even yawning.\n\n\"The Warriors\" wasn't cast with big movie stars nor did it need to be; none of its leads go on eventually to do anything bigger than \"Xanadu\" or Hill's own \"48 Hours.\" This is simply a film with the right actors in the right roles and one which wouldn't have felt right with identifiable big name stars in it. It can be also be said that the creepy villain and the hot-head Warrior, played by two of Hill's regulars David Patrick Kelly and James Remar, clearly got the scene-stealing parts, in contrast, it's hard to make much of the Swan and Mercy roles (Michael Beck and Deborah Van Valkenburgh) the main players of the piece, she clearly wants to be with him, the Warriors fill-in leader, but he acts as if his gang responsibilities had forced him to take a celibacy vow and rejects her advances, only to later be moved by her affliction at not being as good as the rich prom girls they meet in the subway, leading Swan to allow her to walk by his side in the movie's final scene, at sun's dawn by the beach in Coney Island; don't worry if all this doesn't make much sense to you, \"The Warriors\" was never intended to be a movie about complex human relationships.\n\nPerhaps the easiest criticism that can be made about the \"The Warriors\" is how dated it feels today; it's fair to say that it looks very much like a film of its time, Back in the late 70s the exposure to gang films by movie audiences had been mostly limited to less elaborate displays (and definitely tamer ones) such as \"Rebel without a Cause,\" \"The Wild One\" or even \"West Side Story\" but what then was considered innovative or even cool today merely seems curious (to put it kindly). On a recent viewing of \"The Warriors,\" even one of the movie's biggest assets, the much discussed fight scenes, seemed somewhat tame when comparing them with many recent action films: extremely well choreographed but maybe a bit over-choreographed as well, almost like this strange group-ballet, If there is such a thing as a movie that glamorizes violence by making it seem beautiful and exciting, this is clearly it. Still it's fun to see the weaponless Warriors manage to obliterate the gang on roller skates though with the aid of what appears to be a lapse in the earth's gravity force (or simply well hidden trampolines).\n\nWhat makes \"The Warriors\" outstanding however is its energy, its original oddness, the way it touched a nerve with members of the audience who had nothing to do with gangs and yet, made them identify with these people instantly; how else to explain the feelings it awoke in some of them of wanting to belong to groups like these? (and beating each other in the process). The film however isn't the best place to search for reality, otherwise the questions of how these guys finance their uniforms and where they get them made (they sure seem to spend a lot of time designing them), what exactly they do all day, what's the point of hanging around together, etc., etc., might come up. Let's just say \"The Warriors\" made its mark, it entertained audiences and it is well remembered and loved, especially by those of us who got to see it when it first came out. More than enough reasons for me to recommend it"}

It's more of a strange little\ncurio, though, than an important part of the great director's repertoire.\n\nOne thing that bothered me about the film was the loud, obtrusive musical\nscore.

{"text":"A clockwork homage\n\nHUGO is director Martin Scorsese's tribute to the artform to which he has dedicated his life.\n\nBased on the book by Brian Selznick, Hugo is not just the story of a young boy's adventure but also an homage to cinema and the pioneers of film.\n\nFor the director best known for his confronting and often violent masterpieces such as Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Gangs of New York, the innocent and whimsical Hugo is probably the most un-Scorsese film Scorsese has ever made.\n\nYet it still bears the unmistakable fingerprints of the master filmmaker, and as a tribute to the art of cinema, Scorsese has certainly created a moving and beautiful magnum opus with a finely crafted story and memorable characters.\n\nBut, well, I just wasn't as blown away by it as I was expecting to be.\n\nHugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who lives in the walls and hidden rooms of a busy train station in Paris, keeping its many clocks wound, working and on-time.\n\nThe only thing he has left of his dead father is a curious clockwork man, an automaton, which they were trying to repair together.\n\nThe lonely Hugo still works on the automaton day and night, trying to make it work so he can find out what it does, while also trying to avoid being caught by the station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) as he steals food and clockwork parts from shops around the station.\n\nBut it is only when he is caught pilfering by a toymaker (Ben Kingsley) and meets the toymaker's god-daughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), that Hugo uncovers the missing pieces of the mystery.\n\nHugo's story is only a part of the narrative here, the longer thread that ties everything together.\n\nA significant chunk of the story virtually the entire second act focuses on the life and work of pioneering French filmmaker Georges Melies.\n\nMelies is best known today for his 1902 silent film A Trip to the Moon and was an innovator of early special effects, using the new medium of moving pictures to dazzle audiences with fanciful stories and images.\n\nScorsese is clearly an admirer of Melies and the way he depicts the early filmmaker's passion and vision makes the modern audience share in that wonder.\n\nIt is difficult not to be captivated and moved as you watch the techniques Melies used to create his fantasies and watch his still-stunning artworks through eyes more accustomed to computer-generated special effects.\n\nBut how does all this tie in with young Hugo's personal journey? You'll have to watch the film to find out.\n\nStylistically, Hugo looks very much like a French film (something which I'm sure was deliberate), with its rich colour palette, warm lighting, lush characterisation and artfulclose-ups reminiscent of modern classics such as Amelie.\n\nThe performances from Butterfield and Moretz are beautiful, the two young leads showing the kind of multi-layered, emotionally complex performances that much older actors often struggle to perfect.\n\nThese kids have a real connection on screen and their every word, movement and expression is entrancing.\n\nKingsley's performance as a clockwork toymaker with shattered dreams is also a thing of great beauty, the veteran actor creating a complex and fascinating character who always proves surprising.\n\nThe use of 3D is fluid and does not draw much attention to itself, which is probably how it should be, but it is a little too understated to seem particularly noteworthy or innovative, even though it does succeed in building a world that feels like it surrounds the viewer.\n\nThe movie's two-hour running time might be its own worst enemy.\n\nA few people left my screening at about the two-thirds mark, and as the credits rolled several people were heard complaining that it was too long.\n\nBecause of the way the story fits together, each of its three acts feels like a completely different movie: a docu-drama bracketed by a family adventure\/fantasy on each side.\n\nIt isn't until the final act that all the threads start to even look like they intend to come together, which worked very well for me but, as Hugo is essentially a family film, it seems to be leaving some younger and more casual viewers bored or baffled.\n\nIt is a movie that needs to be appreciated for its finer aspects and deeper meaning if it is to be appreciated properly, which is noble enough but could feel exclusive to some.\n\nThat being said, Hugo is definitely a beautiful film and expertly crafted with a gorgeous visual style and a sensitive story that touches on themes of acceptance, the human need to be needed, and searching for our purpose in life."}

{"text":"Each one of us, however noble our deeds, is capable of 'a detestable act'. That appears to be the premise of When No One Is Watching, written and directed by Mark Grey. Seven much lauded charity workers are summoned to a mysterious mansion to be told that they have a chance of a share of \u00a320 million, bequeathed by one Edward Charles Montgomery, who ran 'Command', the humanitarian charity for which they all worked. They are unknown to each other, and none of them knows 'Edward Charles' either. So far so Agatha Christie.\n\nThings then veer towards JB Priestley when several of them are questioned by the 'Colonel' about his wife. They deny all knowledge of her, then realise that they have somehow been complicit in her death without realising it \u2013 though quite what the Colonel and his wife have to do with Mr Montgomery is never made clear.\n\nA kind of parlour game ensues whereby the guests have to decide between them which of their number is guilty of 'a detestable act'. If they fail, they all go away with nothing. So, secrets come tumbling out, they all gang up on each other and generally behave like greedy, lustful human beings. Which is when they realise that each one of them is there to represent one of the deadly sins, though this turns out to be a red herring.\n\nThe direction is awkward in this difficult traverse space, with too many slow cues and out-front 'confessions' but the cast succeeds in generating a sense of mystery and suspense, which saves the day. Just. But this is a waste of an intriguing idea, with a weak ending that suggests that everything we have seen hitherto is irrelevant if they all learn to be 'worthy' in their own lives"}
{"text":"And so what if Tom Cruise needs an elevator to reach the stature of the book version of Jack Reacher, who is described as a 6-foot-5-inch giant with blond hair and icy blue eyes in Lee Child's novels. The tabloid target, who produced the movie so gets quite a bit a say about who plays what character, definitively reaffirms his status as a top-notch movie star in this probable franchise starter.\n\nCruise, 50, keeps his trademark megawatt smile largely under wraps as the title character, an Army brat who became a military cop but had enough authority issues to opt out of service, albeit after his share of serving in war zones. But he didn't enter the civilian world in the usual fashion: Reacher doesn't carry a driver's license or any kind of ID, sticks to riding the bus instead of owning a car, doesn't have a house, cell phone or credit card, shops only at thrift stores and drifts around the country, occasionally tapping his military pension. You don't find Jack Reacher, and if he finds you, you might not wish he had because he only cares about what's right, not what's legal.\n\nReacher turns up in Pittsburgh after ex-Army sniper James Barr (Joseph Sikora) is accused of randomly assassinating five innocent people along the Riverwalk outside PNC Park. In light of the recent tragedy in Newtown, Conn., the tense scenes of the shootings are tough to watch, but the poor timing is hardly the movie's fault.\n\nDetective Emerson (David Oyelowo) seems to have built an airtight case against Barr, and District Attorney Rodin (personal favorite Richard Jenkins) looks to have another slam dunk on his hands. But writer-director Christopher McQuarrie reveals early on that a different shooter committed the murders, and the puzzle becomes who is the mystery man (Jai Courtney), why did he do it and how and why did he so skillfully frame Barr.\n\nFor his part, Barr doesn't defend himself, only telling the district attorney, cops and his defense attorney, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), who happens to be the D.A.'s daughter, to get Jack Reacher before he winds up in a coma. After seeing Barr on the news, Reacher shows up with uncanny good timing.\n\nThe clever investigator suspects his fellow ex-soldier is guilty, until he begins to methodically pick apart the evidence, which doesn't exactly thrill the cops or the real killer.\n\nRobert Duvall shows off his usual good-ol'-boy charm as an ex-Marine gun range owner who aids Reacher, Werner Herzog gets to deliver some chilling lines as a shadowy baddie, and Canadian actress Alexia Fast makes an impression as a dim but sweet young thing who sets up some of Reacher's most sardonically smart dialogue.\n\nMcQuarrie, who won an Oscar for penning the 1995 puzzler \"The Usual Suspects\" and hasn't directed since the little-seen 2000 crime drama \"The Way of the Gun,\" shows off his considerable writing chops with his adaptation of Child's \"One Shot,\" the ninth of his 17 Jack Reacher novels. (Child makes a cameo as a police desk sergeant.)\n\nAs a director, McQuarrie also makes some great, old-school decisions in crafting \"Jack Reacher.\" The film is blessedly free of CGI, the fight scenes are rendered without a lot of flashy jump cuts, the car chase is more about brains than brawny crashes, and the overall paces hearkens back to the action thrillers of the 1970s.\n\nPlus, he lets his movie star be the star of the show. Cruise plays Reacher with a steely stoicism that sort of compels you to watch him just to see what he'll do next. After his 130-minute introduction zipped by so quickly, I wouldn't mind seeing Cruise and McQuarrie team up for another Jack Reacher mystery"}

{"text":"How many body pans can you stand? You know, the reclining shots where the camera begins at the toes and worms its way (slowly) up the female body? In Swimming Pool by Francois Ozon you see this shot several times. Way too many times. It's soft core porn with a fairly good story. Unfortunately, the story is not good enough to cover up the fact that it's soft core pornography. Ozon has been called \"Europe's most daring and inventive writer\/director\" so that should give you a fairly good idea of what you're in for if you spend an hour and 43 minutes watching this film. Oh, wait: I guess if you live in Europe and take a recommendation like that seriously, I should try and make my point from another angle.\n\nThe way Rampling's character wolfs down her food and sucks on her cigarettes while on vacation, along with the oh-so-symbolic removal of the wooden cross above the bed where she sleeps, tells us all we need to know about the mystery writer. The bouncing boobs and the naked men in the bed asleep the next morning tell us all we need to know about the daughter. So what is left to tell? The way two very different people can morph into each other when thrust together in a strange locale? The way we sometimes cannot separate fiction from fact? I'm not sure what the point was in this story, or even if there was one, aside from the body pans. It's not often you see a film with primarily female protagonists. When you do, it should be done with fewer gratuitous boob-shots than this. Try Ingmar Bergman's Cries and Whispers or his Persona or Robert Altman's 3 Women for films that might mean something over and above childish sexual fantasies.\n\nOzon wrote this in collaboration with French novelist and screenwriter Emmanu\u00e8le Bernheim. They worked together on a previous film, Under the Sand, which I didn't see and probably won't.\n\n\"Ozon means to have perversity speak for him, but in the end, it doesn't have a lot to say.\" -- Ella Taylor from the LA Weekly\n\nSwimming pools are artificial pools of water designed so humans\ncan swim in them. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, from\nslightly larger than a hot tub, to an olympic regulation sized swimming pool\n(50m long, wide enough to accommodate a number of lanes for swimmers,\ngenerally about 25m wide.)\n\nYou can have pools that are built above ground, or inground, built into a\nhole excavated in the ground. They will often have a shallow end, and a deep\nend, with the shallow end being shallow enough that some children will be\nable to have their feet touching the ground and still having their nose\nabove the water. Generally about 1 metre deep. The deep end may be only\nslightly deeper, or it may be deep enough that you can safely dive into it\nfrom a high dive. Deepest I've seen is about 10 metres, but I'm sure there's\nmuch deeper out there.\n\nYou can have indoor or outdoor pools, and you can have pools built in\nfunky shapes like a guitar.\n\nThere are two main types of pools. Personal backyard pools, and public\npools. Let's focus on the backyard variety first.\n\nHaving a pool in the backyard is awesome. You've got a nice place to\nrelax when it's hot out, swimming is great exercise, and you're going to\nbe a lot more popular than you were before. And trust me, you could use a\nfew more friends.\n\nThere are of course a few things to consider before getting yourself a\npool. The first to consider would be how often would you use it. I myself\nlive in a vast barren wilderness known as \"Teh Canada\", where the\ndaily high temperature is -50C more than 300 days a year.\nTherefore, the pool would generally only be usable between the months of\nMay and September. I would therefore get a lot less use of out my pool than\na person who lived in Southern California, or anywhere else that generally\nhas Hot to Mild temperatures year round.\n\nThe next factor to consider is the cost. A low end, pre-fabrication above\nground fiberglass pool will still probably set you back about $4000 USD.\nStart looking at excavation, for an in ground pool, and you're probably\nlooking at about $20,000 USD, with the costs increasing if you want a larger\npool, a custom design, or have any adverse ground conditions that may make\ndigging more difficult. You can pretty much spend as much money as you want\non a pool, with increasing size, quality, and fancy features. I want a swim\nup bar.\n\nIf you want your pool to be heated, that's also gonna cost you, the price\nof the heater, plus another $60 - $100 USD a month, in addition to about $20\nUSD a month for electricity to run the pump, and about $400 USD a year for\ncleaning supplies to make sure your brand new pool doesn't grow algae.\n\nAnd, next off, do you have kids? Kids love pools. They get to splash and\nplay in them and it's all a grand old time.\n\nIn the United States, there are over 375 annual drownings of\ntoddlers in residential pools. More than 2700 are hospitalized.\nThat's in kids under the age of 4 *only*. So, if you have children, or if\nyou will *ever* have children over at your house, you need to build a fence\naround that sucker. One that they can't get through. In many places, it's illegal to have a pool without a proper fence around it. It only takes a minute\nfor a kid to slip into the pool, and if that happens when you're not\nwatching and can get them out right away, then they *will* die if they do\nnot receive immediate medical attention. Even if your kid manages to avoid\ndrowning, there is serious risk of permanent brain damage due to oxygen\ndeprivation.\n\nThat's about all I can think of to say about backyard pools. Oh yeah, and\ndon't pee in them.\n\nAnd then there's public pools. They don't necessarily need to be owned by\nthe government, although quite a number are, mostly by the municipal\ngovernment. They're also likely to be owned by the fitness club, the\nY, the local University, or any number of\norganizations.\n\nFirst off, they are far more likely to be indoor pools, and are more\nlikely to have a deep end, and to be a lot bigger. The two main differences\nare that they are quite likely to have a trained lifeguard on duty at all\ntimes, and of course the public changing rooms, with their\ncommunal showers, tiny little lockers to shove your clothes into, and the\nathlete's foot.\n\nThey will often offer scheduled swimming lessons for all ability\nlevels, so it would seem to be a good idea to start out at a public pool and\nwork your way up to getting your own. That's about all I can think of to say\nfor public pools. Oh yeah, and don't pee in them.\n\nTo sum it up, if it's warm where you live and you can afford it, getting\na pool can be great. Just be sure to be safe with them. If\nit's not warm enough to justify buying your own, go to the pool at the\nY or something. I'm sure there's probably at least one near you that\nyou can swim in for a nominal fee."}

{"text":"Released: February 6, 2004\n\nDirected by:\n\nCast:\n\nTwo of Bernardo Bertolucci's great loves -- sex and movies -- are celebrated, analyzed, partaken of and discussed in \"The Dreamers,\" a film that, despite its potentially volatile subject matter, is innocuous and good-natured.\n\nIt's a bit of a history lesson for folks younger than, say, 40. I wrote just a week ago that the Vietnam documentary \"The Fog of War\" cannot possibly mean as much to a Gen-Xer (or -Yer, or anyone younger) as it would to a Baby Boomer, and the same holds true of \"The Dreamers.\"\n\nIt is set in Paris in 1968, when the French New Wave filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut were changing the art of moviemaking, and when a Parisian student riot was about to erupt because, of all things, the director of the Cinematheque Francais had been fired. In the midst of all this is naive American student Matthew (Michael Pitt), a 20-year-old film buff who spends every waking hour at the cinema, along with his unwashed, unkempt film-buff brethren and sisters. He meets his kindred spirits, twins named Theo (Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green), who invite him to stay at their family's apartment.\n\nHere they engage in all manner of mind games, movie-trivia games and sex games, a strange triangle of youthful insouciance and blithe know-it-allness. The three are partly lovers, and partly just lovers of film. Outside, though, events are conspiring that will foment revolution.\n\nThe characters speak, think and act in the language of film; for them, movies are everything. Cinema informs everything they do. It is the same way for Bertolucci, and it's energizing to see a movie so devoted to conveying that obsession. Snippets of old movies are spliced in as they are referenced, a dozen or so in total, plus many more that are mentioned but not shown.\n\nWhen Matthew and Theo argue over whether Chaplin or Keaton was better, Theo makes his case by describing the final moments of Chaplin's \"City Lights.\" By coincidence, I had seen this movie for the first time about two weeks before seeing \"The Dreamers,\" so it was fresh in my mind -- but what Theo says about it is something I hadn't considered, and it made me want to go watch it again. Bertolucci has succeeded in making a movie that makes me want to go watch OTHER movies.\n\nOther movies are, to be sure, more emotionally engaging than this one, whose characters are aloof and inscrutable. Few movies, though, are more beautifully composed: Bertolucci and cinematographer Fabio Cianchetti construct every shot carefully, often building shapes out of the characters' positions or referencing shots from other films. Even if you don't pay attention to such things, you will subconsciously realize you're watching something that has been assembled with precision and expertise.\n\nI don't know how much a casual filmgoer will like the movie. It seems designed only for hardcore movie buffs -- and I mean movie buffs who are hardcore about it, not buffs of hardcore movies (though I suppose that applies to certain elements of it, too). It speaks with enthusiasm about its subject matter; the question is whether it's preaching to the choir, or to the uninterested.\n\nNote: Much has been made of the film's NC-17 rating for \"explicit sexual content.\" In truth, the sexual content is no more explicit than many R-rated films; it is, rather, the nudity (and the frequency of it) that is more explicit than usual. The film is set in the height of the sexual revolution, which coincided with (and is interconnected with) the French New Wave and the Parisian student riots, and thus a high degree of sexuality and nudity fit the story. I'm not sure it's all completely \"justified,\" but since when are filmmakers required to \"justify\" themselves to anyone?\n\nGrade: B\n\nRated NC-17, a lot of frank nudity and some graphic sexuality, some harsh profanity\n\nThis item has 2 comments\n\nI just watched the movie Dreamers and thought there may be more to the movie than what I have seen posted to the web so far and would like others comments.\n\nIs it possible there was the message that the twins would not move forward in their personal development similar to society would not about war or violence that Matthew was trying to make the twins understand? Matthew tries to tell the twins to have sexual relationships with other people and to grow emotionally by getting out and dating other people. The twins after being labeled freaks lose their virginity which both found extremely painful with Isabella crying out banging on the door to her brother's room from her very organized pure childhood bedroom adorned with stuffed bears. Is her brother the red one?\n\nThen Matthew challenges Theo to not just talk about changing the government from his home but take to the streets with the people. Matthew mentions the people holding one book shouting the same slogan which is what the people are doing when the three join the protestors in the street \"Take to the street\" is repeated over and over, no one making their own chant until the fire scene but I could not hear what is said by Theo. Theo takes up this challenge dragging his sister along, Isabelle choosing to go with her brother instead of staying with Matthew. Matthew feels he has lost and backs out seeing the twins using violence to prove their point proof they still have not progressed.\n\nYet is Matthew the weak one? He is dodging the Vietnam draft by living or hiding in France instead of protesting or going to jail to stand up for his belief, isn't that what he told Theo to do? Is it brave to reject his father's beliefs and not go to war chancing the loss of his father's love forever yet he is approved of by the twins father. Are the parents of the twins the same as Matthew in hiding from their children whenever there is a disagreement with the father? When they find the children all nude an intertwined they just leave money and run letting the children know they were there but left without confronting them. Then Isabella's weak attempt of committing suicide leaving the door open but trying to gas them?\n\nI cannot figure out though the point of the frying eggs while the deflowering is happening, what did that stand for? I see that Theo wants to be present for the pain his sister is feeling while she is laying on the dirty, hard, cold kitchen floor with no ceremony or love. Yet why is he secluded during his deflowering in his \"pig\" bedroom that is dirty and smelly? Then he turns on Isabelle's music to cause her pain from her pure childhood room? Is this the director's thought that men have the power to cause the weaker sex pain? Are the eggs reflecting woman and one yolk being broken is his sister?\n\nIs there some type of rivalry between Theo and Matthew or are they suppose to represent light and darkness with their views?\n\nI didn't see where on this web page I could read other comments about Dreamers unless no one has commented for this movie, I do hope others will comment. Please excuse my lack of grammar I am up in age and it just doesn't come to me anymore like it use to but I do love to discuss movies.\n\nI honestly have never mulled over most of the points you brought up in particular, but I can answer that last question for you (or rather make an educated assumption). The movie was based on a book called \"The Holy Innocents\". Most thing regarding the relationships between the characters were the same as in the movie, with a notable exception--Matthew and Theo (called Guillaume in the book) become lovers as well, after undergoing the strange rivalry you sensed over Isabelle (called Danielle in the book). I have no idea why this wasn't included in \"The Dreamers\"; I feel like it would have balanced out the weird relationship situation and created a more comfortable triangle.\n\nI would normally recommend reading the original book a movie is based off of, but this is one of those rare situations in which the movie is superior anyway. The book has little focus, is far more political than the movie, and is much messier in terms of thematic coherence."}
{"text":"This first movie based on Patrick O'Brien's hugely popular 20-volume series of books about a ship's captain during the Napoleonic Wars falls into the Harry Potter category: the intensely detailed books have passionate and intensely detail-oriented fans, so any movie version had to be flawlessly meticulous.\n\nCo-screenwriter\/director Peter Weir (Dead Poet's Society, The Truman Show) has delivered a respectful but exciting film based on two of the books. He clearly intends it to be the all-but-impossible \u2014 a thoughtful and intelligent action film for grown-ups. And it comes pretty close.\n\nJack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is captain of a tall ship called the H.M.S. Surprise in 1805, the midst of the Napoleonic Wars. His orders are to \"sink, burn, or take as a prize\" a French ship called the Acheron. But it is Aubrey who is surprised when the Acheron attacks. Many of his crew are injured or killed and his ship is badly damaged.\n\nAubrey must chart a new course on many levels. The Acheron is more powerful. Aubrey has no way of getting any information, direction, or support from home. He must lead his men (some of whom are still boys) into battle against a daunting enemy, knowing that many will be wounded or killed.\n\nAubrey is a good captain. He treats the men with dignity, kindness, and respect. But he understands that they need him to be a leader, not a friend, and that sometimes requires discipline and distance. Aubrey's nickname is \"Lucky Jack.\" He knows that when he is in command of a group of boys and men a long way from home, it helps if they believe that he is lucky as well as wise. But that means he has to stay lucky.\n\nThe action scenes are exceptionally well-staged, putting the audience in the middle of the battles. The details are perfectly rendered \u2014 every gun, every blast, even every sound. But the action is balanced with a strong, classically structured story of the friendship between Aubrey and the ship's doctor, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany, last seen as Crowe's roommate in A Beautiful Mind). They are friends and they share a great deal as they play music together in the quiet evenings. But they are very different. Aubrey is a man of action who gives and follows orders. Maturin is a man of science who believes that battles are tragic distractions from the pursuit of knowledge to make the world a better place. Their two perspectives provide balance as they struggle with their duties.\n\nAll of the performances are exceptionally strong and Crowe is splendid as Aubrey. He has the dash and the gravity and the sheer star power to provide the center of the movie, even in the midst of flying cannonballs. Weir has succeeded in making a film that is true to O'Brien's books, utterly respectful of the history but all about the story.\n\nParents should know that the movie has prolonged and intense battle violence and some graphic scenes of amputation and surgery. Characters are in peril and many are severely wounded or killed, including some who are still children. A character is whipped as punishment. A character commits suicide. Characters drink and smoke and there are references to drunkenness, including the impact of extra rations of rum for the sailors.\n\nFamilies who see this movie should talk about Why does Dr. Maturin say that \"the deaths in actual battle are the easiest to bear?\" Would Aubrey agree? How does Aubrey's joke about \"the lesser of two weevils\" turn out to relate to some of the movie's deeper themes? Why does Aubrey say, \"I can only afford one rebel on this ship?\" Who is he referring to? Characters in this movie are constantly making very difficult choices. Which did you think were most difficult? Which would you have decided differently?\n\nFamilies who enjoy this movie will also enjoy seafaring classics like Errol Flynn's Captain Blood and Against All Flags and Gregory Peck's Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N.. They will also enjoy the recent A&E television Horatio Hornblower miniseries starring Ioan Gruffudd"}
{"text":"Pages\n\nSunday, December 18, 2011\n\nReview: Shame\n\nWhat you know about Shame is that it's an NC-17 portrait of a sex addict. To a teenager (or those who have never watched an Almodovar film) the taboo rating signifies something immediately forbidden. There will be nudity, there will be sex that somehow qualifies as \"more adult\" than the MPAA's R-rating. In all likelihood: there will be boobs. It's true. But, you know, where aren't there boobs? So, the thing is that there will also be a penis flopping about somewhere. If you're lucky, it won't belong to Harvey Keitel. What gets overlooked, often times, is that simple body parts do not an NC-17 rating warrant. In the case of Shame, and, in my experience, the case of a great deal of NC-17 'serious' films (versus 'unrated'), anatomy is sullied. Sexualized content is rarely sexy. It will be somehow dirtied up, plot relevant, and often horribly unpleasant. What this really means, apparently, is that when an NC-17 film actually makes it into a theater, the combination of these elements will prove a great annoyance. Personally? I was carded multiple times before the film started, the theater management felt the need to post detailed warnings as far out as the parking garage elevator that Shame contained content of a graphic nature, and that the final usher to check my ID muttered \"Good luck\" as I walked in. \"Don't worry,\" I assured him, \"I won't ask for my money back.\""}

And yes, Brendan Gleeson does a brilliant job!\nThe humour is british but not like in Hot Fuzz so it's not too weird and I don't see why people tend to say you got to have a sense of black humour.\nThe movie and it's feeling is in my opinion best compared to In Bruges. I really recommend this one."}
{"text":"If you like your women half-naked, strung upside-down from pulleys, and sliced like deli meat, this is the movie for you. Whether the victims are more tortured than the plot is a serious question.\nAl Pacino stops by to pick up his paycheck as Dr. Jack Gramm, a forensic psychiatrist described by a defense lawyer as \"this year's prosecution expert du jour,\" whose testimony sends a fellow named Forster (Neal McDonough) to death row as a serial killer.\nThe opening scene is particularly noisome, as two nice Asian twins get the killer treatment. One of the sisters survives. She's the only eyewitness testimony at Forster's trial, and she's none too sure about her identification, but Gramm's expert testimony convinces the jury.\n\nNine years later, Forster's appeals have been exhausted and his execution date has come due. But just as justice is about to take its course, women start turning up dead, dispatched with the exact MO for which Forster is about to pay the supreme penalty. Is it a copycat killer? Is Forster innocent as he claims? To make matters worse for Gramm (and for us), he gets a phone call telling him he has 88 minutes left to live. Why 88 minutes? You'll find out if you see the movie and stay long enough.\nYou'll have to stay longer than those eponymous 88 minutes. Theoretically they unspool in real time, but the clock doesn't start ticking until that phone call comes, nearly 20 minutes into the nasty proceedings. Then, as the voice on the phone says with each succeeding call, it's \"tick-tock, Doc.\"\n\nSo it's up to Gramm to save his own skin and find the killer, keep Forster on Death Row, dodge bullets and motorcycles and fire engines and car bombs, and avoid being arrested as the perp when his DNA starts littering the crime scenes like popcorn on the floor of a movie theater.\nJust about everyone, including Gramm, looks suspicious as hell. Even in crowd scenes the camera lingers for an extra beat here and there on shifty-looking creeps, and among Gramm's circle of acquaintance (he admits to having practically no friends) there is virtually no one who doesn't raise a red flag. In addition to his busy schedule as the world's leading forensic psychiatrist\/star witness, he also teaches at the university, where his students are a bright and dodgy lot. They include his beautiful teaching assistant Kim (Alicia Witt), a clever fellow named Mike (Benjamin McKenzie), and a round-faced, smirking Amazon named Lauren (Leelee Sobieski). Dean Johnson (Deborah Kara Unger), who drops into Gramm's classroom to announce a bomb threat, doesn't pass the trust test either. Gramm's loyal lesbian assistant Shelly (Amy Brenneman) is so loyal that you can't be sure about her. And when we start dipping into the minor characters, like the security cop at the University, Kim's ex-husband, or the doorman at Gramm's apartment building, you realize it's a jungle out there and paranoia is the most normal of conditions.\n\nActually, though, you will probably spot the killer pretty early. There's a scene that practically pins an \"arrest me\" sign to the back of one of the characters, hard to miss if you are paying any kind of attention.\nThrough it all Pacino smolders, struts, glowers, and rattles the celluloid as only Pacino can. Even when he's not trying, and he seldom seems to be trying very hard here, he commands attention. Even when he's at his most phlegmatic, it's as if there's another actor inside him storming around, cracking a whip and working very hard. Pacino is worth his weight in gold to this production, but it must be remembered he's not a big man.\n\nDirector Jon Avnet (who made a nice start years ago with Fried Green Tomatoes, but hasn't lived up to that promise) does his best to distract attention from the ludicrous script by keeping the action moving at a giddy pace, but it's no good. There are shoals of red herrings, there are blind alleys, dead ends, twists, and revelations. There are places where continuity and plausibility seem so bizarre that you almost, but not quite, want to see the movie again to see if it all really happened the way you think it did. And the closer it comes to the finish line, the more outrageous and nonsensical things get.\n\nPacino still makes good movies when they come his way. His Shylock was powerful, but that was four years ago, and it's been five years since he won an Emmy as Roy Cohn in Angels in America. For that matter, it's been two years since he played Dr. Jack Gramm, forensic psychiatrist. This movie has been skulking in Columbia's storeroom since 2006, and it came out on DVD over a year ago in Europe. They don't come calling with the award-winning material as often when you're bearing down on 70, even if your name is Al Pacino. So it's nice to know that he's still working, but you might want to just take my word for it."}
{"text":"There was a Hushpuppy and she lived with her daddy in the Bathtub\u2026It begins almost like a \"Once upon a time\" fairytale. But children have a way of making the most complex stories sound so simple and \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" is much more than a simple tale of a girl living with her dad.\n\n\"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" is the tale of Hushpuppy, a poor 6-year-old girl facing orphanhood. Economic struggles and the loss of loved ones can be difficult concepts for anyone to grasp and deal with, but for a small child, it's even harder. Despite the harshness of her reality, Hushpuppy's story is a magical one filled with imagination, bravery and hope. It's the type of heroic story that only a child could tell.\n\nAt the start of the film, Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis) introduces us to her isolated community, Bayou community known as The Bathtub. From her eyes, everything seems truly spectacular: you feel her sense of love for her father, delight in her pretend dinner parties and gasp with glee at her wonderful descriptions of the town's frequent holiday celebrations. For having no money and no mother, Hushpuppy makes it seem like she has a lot. But despite her optimistic narrative, it's impossible to ignore the tides of sadness ebbing in at the sides of her world. The reality is that Hushpuppy is malnourished, abandoned by her mother, and her beloved father (Dwight Henry) is an abusive, often absent drunk that's slowly dying. She's on the brink of orphanhood and the reality of her world is downright awful.\n\nRunning through Hushpuppy's narrative is the story of these mythical boar-like beasts, trampling straight for her and leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. These made up creatures are very real to Hushpuppy and are the embodiment of her fear. Their presentation is a lot like the beasts in \"Where the Wild Things Are.\" They're illogical and imaginary, but very matter of fact and tangible to the child, which makes them the realest thing in the world. Can Hushpuppy face the threat they pose to her carefully crafted world?\n\n\"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" is not an easy film to sum up in a few sentences, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It's a magical story with some very big and real issues that are presented spectacularly. It's not like poverty and death haven't been shown in film before, but Benh Zeitlin's \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" is a unique, fantastic story with a perspective that's often overlooked in films. The young, new actors such as star Wallis are wonderful casting finds. Wallis brings a special authenticity to the story and has a bright future ahead.\n\nYes, there was a girl named Hushpuppy and she lived in The Bathtub with her father, but there was also so much more and it is worth going to theaters to see her story"}
{"text":"BLOGS\n\nThe premise for Welcome to the Rileys has been described by some critics as the thinking moviegoer's The Blind Side, and I suppose that's fair. After losing their daughter in a car accident, a married couple (played magnificently by James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo) have grown apart, and have managed to avoid facing and dealing with their crushing grief. Like, completely. They don't speak to each other, he's cheating with a Waffle House waitress, and she's deathly afraid to leave the house, among other issues. But when Gandolfini comes across a teen hooker (played by Kristen Stewart) with more sores than positive role models in her life while on a business trip to New Orleans, he decides she represents a second chance at saving his daughter, gets Melissa Leo on board, and after a bumpy road, emotional healing is had by all.\n\nIt's a movie about love and loss, and pain and grief, and reasonably priced po' boys and scabby hookers and the French Quarter and second lines, and DIY home improvement and how sometimes what you fear is gonorrhea just turns out to be a UTI, and all of that, supported and elevated by excellent performances, amounts to something really nice: that hope and redemption are always possible. I mean, there have been a million \"indie dramas\" about that and it takes a pretty formulaic road to that destination, but when it's James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo taking you there, it's still mesmerizing to watch. And the emotion is genuine and makes sense, even if it seems a bit melodramatic in its execution. Yes, it's crazy that Gandolfini's character -- a wealthy businessman -- would extend his New Orleans trip to move in with a diseased Kristen Stewart and fix up her not-exactly-up-to-code slum, but grief makes you do crazy things, and the grief of losing a child, I'd imagine, would make you do even crazier things. Through that periscope, it really doesn't seem that ridiculous.\n\nThe script is not without some major issues, however. The movie wraps up so neatly it's not only lazy, it feels like it was tacked on from some other, lesser movie. All three characters have this major breakdown in one scene, and then in the next everyone is cleaned up and happy a few months later, and everybody's friends, and everything's great, and it's like -- what? How is that even possible? These people were dying the last time we saw them! There are a few moments like that, where things just happen a little too quickly or are a little too clich\u00e9d, that it takes you out of it, but if you discount the hackneyed ending, the movie really is a nice little tearjerker on the whole.\n\nOh, and Kristen Stewart? She's honestly not bad. Her character's main characteristic is that she's unpleasant, however, so maybe that's why she didn't seem miscast. But either way, she wasn't anywhere near as annoying and terrible as I'd expected. Though if you're thinking about seeing this because it's been billed as \"The Kristen Stewart Stripper Movie,\" sorry, she remains clothed and really doesn't do any stripping all movie. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nDid you see the movie? Did you like it? Tell us what you thought below!"}

{"text":"The Mechanic\n\nThe basic plot of The Mechanic\u2014a loose remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson movie of the same name\u2014holds boundless promise for action fans, and mostly fulfills it: A preternaturally skilled hitman (Jason Statham) teaches a young loose cannon (Six Feet Under's Ben Foster) the tricks of his slick, deadly trade. But things aren't that simple, naturally. The duo connect at the funeral of Foster's father (Donald Sutherland), who was also Statham's mentor in the killin' business\u2014and whom Statham murdered early in the movie, under orders from his clearly no-good handler. Feeling some pang of regret even though Sutherland double-crossed the company, Statham takes the hotheaded, boozed-out scamp under his wing and sets about making him into an ice-veined killer. It's the least he can do, right?\n\nFor a good chunk of its running time, The Mechanic is a buddy movie about two guys really enjoying murder together. They almost seem ready to high-five after a job well done, even as Statham's character glumly explains \"I wanted you to see one up close.\" In order to ease the audience's conscience, the protagonists' victims are conveniently more awful than they are: an arms dealer \"who'll sell to anybody,\" a ridiculous cult leader, a hulking gay assassin who wants to fuck Foster. Statham's hit-plans are frequently complex, and he's always eight or nine steps ahead of everyone else\u2014so much that it would've been nice to see these guys actually planning more assignments instead of just watching those assignments unfold. But that would leave less screen time for strangulations, splattery headshots, and murder-by-fireplace-tools, so maybe it's just as well.\n\nStatham and Foster play off each other nicely, and director Simon West (Con Air) strikes a playful balance between carnage and conviviality, gore and gregariousness. A confrontation between the two leads is inevitable, and since The Mechanic is so morally muddled to begin with, it's difficult to tell where things are headed, or how to take sides. That isn't because these characters are well-drawn or terribly complex\u2014they assuredly aren't\u2014but it's still an unusual, intriguing path for a movie like this to travel. The only thing certain going into the climax is that guns will be fired and things will explode in style. Couple that with actual acting\u2014Statham is the most winning action hero around, and Foster brings some nuance that the script probably doesn't deserve\u2014and it's bloody fun."}
{"text":"My Rating\n\nMovie Info\n\nWELCOME TO THE RILEYS\nderail their relationship, turns out to be the inspiration they need to renew their marriage. -- (C) Samuel Goldwyn\n\nAudience Reviews for Welcome to the Rileys\n\nThere's a lot of drams that are made to be \"award bait\". Which means, it will get a lot of nominations, which will increase it's visibility and make money. But, there are a lot of movies made for that reason, that don't come out right and end up getting no awards and making no money. \"Welcome to the Rileys\" is one of those flicks. It stars James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo as a middle aged married couple who have grown apart. Doug(Gandolfini) has a business trip to New Orleans, and while there he meets a 17 year old stripper(Kristen Stewart). He doesn't want a relationship with her or sex, he just wants to help her the way a father would help a daughter. Lois(Leo) is agoraphobic but finds the will to come to New Orleans to be with Doug. From there conflicts with Stewart and some secrets come out. The performances are all just ok. Gandolfini is the best, but he just seems to be going through the motions. Stewart does the exact same thing here as all her movies. Lip biting, playing with her hair, and pouting. She has that all down pat. The movie drags and doesn't really give much of a conclusion. Worth a watch? I a copy for free, and I'd say that would be the only reason to watch it. I'm sure there are some people who like this, but it didn't work for me at all really.\n\nGood movie! Welcome to the Riley's was a very interesting little American indie film. The movie is a little clich\u00e9d and sugarcoated but there's also a lot of dark and ugly notes in the film as well and it manages to strike an even balance. The acting and directing is decent enough that the setup seems believable and you really learn to care for the characters. Gandolfini is good and lovable like always and Leo turns in another impressive performance and continues to show her range. It's Stewart that really shines in the film though and silences her critics by continuing to broaden her range as well. The film is emotional and rewarding to a certain extent. Nothing too powerful or memorable but a nice little indie drama that gives some good actors some nice material to play around with. Worth seeing if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSomething's wrong at the Rileys. Married nearly 30 years, Doug and Lois rarely talk. She doesn't leave their Indianapolis home, and she's ordered a gravestone with their names and birth years on it. He has a long-time Thursday night mistress whom he invites to go with him to a plumbing supply conference in New Orleans. Once there, Doug calls Lois to say he's staying for a while. What's he leaving behind and what's he looking for in New Orleans? And Lois, can she break out?"}
{"text":"RATING:\n\nstar55\n\nThis is a dark film adapted from that brilliant story \"In a Grove\". This is a film about...you guessed it: the dark ambiguity of human nature. So after a first viewing for modern audiences, there is bound to be that question: What the hell did I just see?\n\nThe performances are the simply frightening. Mifune acts out the horrific candor of his bandit character, making us question how twisted a person can really be. Then there's the lady, frightening how she \"might\" be capable of demonstrating a polar opposite that is also evil. The guy is really actor Mifune's opposite, with an acting style that is quiet and effective in suggestion. Nobody knows what he's really thinking(modern audiences are smart enough to be skeptical regarding that psychic). The woodcutter is the big surprise of this movie. Takashi Shimura is first innocent, later just downright weak and cowardly. The monk and that third person at Rashomon gate play off each other well as polar opposites, optimism vs. cynicism.\n\nKurosawa's direction is quite simple, I think. He simply establishes settings and builds atmosphere. He allows the story to tell itself in a fluid way, and does everything he can to get the effect he wants(he doused the entire district water supply with black ink so the rain can be captured on camera). Kazuo Miyagawa simply goes gung-ho with the camera. He's got the camera shooting straight into the sun for the first time in film history. He uses lots and lots of dollys so the camera can move the way he wants it to. The guy's more of a perfectionist than Kurosawa himself...\n\nThe ending is something...after all that darkness Kurosawa dares to throw an optimistic ending at us. Most films like this ends in tragedy, but not this one. This one ends...well does it properly end? Not really. I swear this is the most challenging optimistic ending I have ever seen. I eventually understood why I was so challenged by such a ending. It was because by the time I got to the end I didn't believe these people could be capable of truth and goodness anymore. This film though challenges by ending with a \"but\". All depends now on the viewer: Do you believe that humanity is forever stuck in a dark muddle, or do you believe in a goodness that can prevail?\n\nI'm trying...I'm trying real hard to keep hope...(borrowed from Samuel L.

{"text":"role in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" with \"Exorcist II: The Heretic,\" a move from which her career never quite recovered).\n\n\"I Dreamed of Africa\" probably looked great on paper: Basinger gets to play a strong, willful woman who outlives just about everyone around her; she gets to play the range of emotions, from despair to exultation to righteous anger; and she gets to play an animal rights activist, which, according to news articles, she believes to be her destiny as an actress. Unfortunately, the resulting film is a protracted, tedious docudrama that's long on pathos and short on narrative interest, and it never makes Kuki Gallmann into a truly interesting character.\n\nThis is a shame because, in every article I've read about Gallmann, she sounds like a fascinating person. Born into Italian wealth and privilege, she was badly hurt in a car wreck in which her future second husband, Paolo (Vincent Perez), was also involved. Told she would never walk again, Kuki persevered and eventually married Paolo, who was a restless adventurer. In 1973, they moved with Kuki's 7-year-old son from a previous marriage, Emanuele (Garrett Strommen), to the Ol Ari Nyiro ranch near the Great Rift Valley in Kenya. It is here that the majority of the film slogs along while documenting their life amid the dangers of Africa.\n\nUnfortunately, on screen, Kuki never truly comes to life as the extraordinary person she is made out to be in news articles. This is not so much the fault of Basinger's performance as it is the script by Paula Milne (\"Mad Love\") and Susan Shilliday (\"Legends of the Fall\"), which was based on Gallmann's best-selling autobiographical book. The script deals much less in character development than it does in disasters and tragedies.\n\nRather than truly exploring Gallmann's growing love for Africa (the best we get are some stilted voice-over narrations), the film documents one tragedy after another, starting with the deadly car wreck in Italy, and then moving to Africa to include a buffalo attack, a lion attack, a highway robbery, a killer windstorm, two major deaths in the family, cattle disease, and a string of poachers. Granted, all of this probably happened (the opening title card reminds us, as if we didn't already know, that this is \"A True Story\"), but it shouldn't be the focus of the film.\n\nAfrica herself is meant to be a character with which Gallmann and her family interact, but we never get that in a visual sense (hence, the need for the lousy narration). Director Hugh Hudson, who scored big with 1981's \"Chariots of Fire\" and then all but decimated his career with the 1985 disaster \"Revolution,\" seems lost in the story. He and cinematographer Bernard Lutic fill the screen with glorious, sweeping panoramas of the African wilderness, but they don't seem to know how to make the landscape more than just postcard-pretty. What the film really needed was a director like Terrence Malick, whose three films, \"Badlands\" (1973), \"Days of Heaven\" (1978), and \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), were brilliant at merging the landscape with the characters, making them part of each other.\n\nYou can sense that this is what Hudson would like to do, but he can't seem to pull it off. Maybe it's because Basinger simply looks too pretty all the time: For a rancher in Africa, her hair always looks like Paul Mitchell himself just washed and styled it. Or, maybe it's because Gallmann's character development is never made clear. When and why is it that she gives herself over to \"the Dark Continent\" and makes it her life's passion? In the film, it feels more like Gallmann is simply tolerating her life in Africa rather than embracing it, and the disparity between those two positions makes all the difference in the world."}

Her legendary feminine intuition refusing the fatal outcome, she starts an investigation to discover the truth.\n\nThose who liked Audrey Tautou will be satisfied, since she's the driving force of the film, and displays her now famous Am\u00e9lie smiles, but also shows the face of despair and melancholy in front of events.\nIf you enjoyed the previous film's visual choices, you'll be treated with spectacular natural landscapes and early 20th century interiors and city views (Paris mostly).\nHow typically french is the movie ? Lots and lots. Costumes, faces, language, you name it. The cast is top-notch, you'll keep asking 'who's that ?' after leaving the theatre.\nI had not been completely enchanted by 'Am\u00e9lie', partly because of the character's immaturity. But 'Un long dimanche...' is much darker (the context of WW1 is still a painful wound in the french psyche) and more adult. It brought me misty eyes repeatedly (and it doesn't happen to me often).\n\n[QUOTE=snuffy]every shot in amelie and in the city looks like a painting. did this movie do the same thing?[\/QUOTE]\n.\n\n__________________________\n\n[url=\nall it takes is $60 and a dream.\n\n[QUOTE=snuffy]i also love the posters from 1995[\/QUOTE]\ni haven't seen any posters. i should do a sweep of jeunet\/carot - after i'm done collecting whatever i'm doing now, christopher guest movies, i guess, and then i have to finish with wes anderson, they're next. look out, jean-pierre, cominatcha\n\n__________________________\n\n[url=\nall it takes is $60 and a dream.\n\n[QUOTE=vidalia].[\/QUOTE]\n\nYou know, I rented City of Lost Children earlier this summer and I didn't care for it much. It was a shame because it seemed to get just beaming comments about it online, yet I just couldn't get into it. I did notice that film and Amelie have these random \"chain of events\" scenes, such as the dog running around and just stopping to fuck another dog in City, and all the funny little random bits in Amelie. I did like Amelie though. I need to rent it because I saw it in the theater my first time, so it's been a while.\n\nWhat'd you think of her in Dirty Pretty Things? I thought she did a good job acting but the movie was a bit of a letdown as well. It wasn't horrible, it just didn't excite me like I was hoping it would.\n\nI thought this thread deserved a bump because this movie just got released in the US. My parents took me to see it a few weeks ago, and I LOVED it. We went to see it because my father is a war picture aficianado, and because I'd just seen \"Dirty Pretty Things\" and fallen in love with Audrey Tautou.\n\nThis is, hands down, one of the most violent war movies I've ever seen. It's up there with \"Saving Private Ryan.\" It was interesting because WWI isn't taught very thoroughly in most American schools, and I think it's easy for us to forget how horrific it was, with modern weaponry but without the advent of antibiotics.\n\nAnother reason I liked this movie was because it's a lot of different genres at the same time. It's a war movie, and a romance, and also a very engaging mystery. Most of the movie is Mathilde following clues and tracking down people to find her fianc\u00e9 who might or might not be dead, and unlike many other period pictures, this movie never gets slow. Overall, I give this all the thumbs I possess up.\n\nI am so thrilled this thread exists!!! I was wondering about this film and most people have no idea what I am talking about when I mention it ... I'm am so excited, it sounds good. Sadly, I have to drive 4 hours to get to a theatre that has it ...\n\nI found it better than Am\u00e9lie because I didn't completely buy the character, that I found slightly childish, while 'Un long dimanche...\/ A long engagement\" is about people forced to make choices as adults.\nBut of course it's a personal feeling and I fully understand that many people could fall under the spell of Am\u00e9lie.\nI am curious to know how all of you reacted to the strong 'Frenchness' expressed in both films.\n\n[QUOTE=franc tireur]I am curious to know how all of you reacted to the strong 'Frenchness' expressed in both films.[\/QUOTE]\n\nI'm introducing the vague notion of Frenchness, because I've already heard many people insist on how French they found Am\u00e9lie, whatever they put behind it. Was it the score played with the accordion, or the typical Paris sights ? Or something less obvious ? I don't know very well, because most of the elements of the film are natural to me.\nAll I can say is that in 'A very long engagement', the most significantly French aspect of the film is the trauma that WW1 caused in our national culture. I think the film conveyed it even to people who didn't percieve it as directly as I did.\n\n[QUOTE=Thag]Is there a theatre in Chicago that has the movie playing tonight?[\/QUOTE]\nI would imagine Chicago has it playing somewhere, since it's in one of the Detroit theaters right now. (time lapse) And for some reason i was just moved to check, and it is indeed in some Chicago theaters, although damned if i know where those theaters actually are in Chicago\n\nMan, i loved the Amelie soundtrack, hopefully going to go see A Very Long Engagement tonight, anyway.\n\nI need to see this movie... I still kinda regret that I chose to learn (?) Spanish and not French in school.\n\nI liked Amelie, and the Frenchness that you mentioned was very much there. Even a Parisness. I've been to Paris and the movie really well displays this huge metropole in which people live like normal citizens, and not like freaked out big-towners.\n\nI live close by to the Boddington's factory. Interbrew, the brewery that run the place, are closing it down. It's costing too much to produce the beer in Manchester, so they're taking somewhere else. It's a shame really. Boddington's is just as much a part of Manchester as Strangeways prison, The Hacienda, The Stone Roses, The Smiths and The Happy Mondays. Now they're taking it away from us.\nBTW: I've just finished editing a training video on how to pure the perfect pint Boddington's. It also included, Stella Artois, Leffe, Hoeggarden, Murphy's and Bass. We filmed all the shots in the Brewery Tap, the pub that is situated on the factory site. Le sigh.\n\nBUMP ! I'm watching the DVD, and JP Jeunet's commentary is absolutely priceless. He gives out lots of details on the technical aspects, but also on the influences he pays hommage to in this very dense film.\nFunnily, from time to time, he says \"this is a failed film\", because of a small detail like an actor's hair"}
{"text":"Archive for April, 2009\n\nCrap, it's been forever since I've blogged. Been busy, I guess. Anyway, the film festival CPH:PIX is currently running in Copenhagen, ending this Sunday. I've seen eight movies so far, and I though I would write some small reviews of them.\n\nD\u00f8d Sn\u00f8\n\nD\u00f8d Sn\u00f8 as a Norwegian zombie movie I've been looking forward to for a while. It was a late night screening in Glyptoteket, so the mood was set for some zombie action. I was actually surprised about how much I liked the movie, it's more of a parody, well, a tribute, to zombie movies. The zombie make-up is amazing (which it has to be, when you're working in full, snowblinding daylight), and the movie is filled with hilarious zombie-killing scenes.\n\nA Hungarian thriller, The Investigator follows Malk\u00e1v, a pathologist, who needs money for his mother's surgery. When a man offers him \u20ac40.000 for killing a man, he quickly accepts, only to find out the man was his half-brother. A conspiracy slowly unfolds as the movie turns into a detective story. The character of Malk\u00e1v is very well acted, he doesn't say much, and seems cold-hearted, but it becomes apparent that there are more layers to the man. Amazing movie, worth a watch.\n\nBased on a 2003 tv-series, State of Play follows reporters Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) and Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) trying to uncover what lies behind the apparent suicide of Sonia Baker, a senate lead researcher and mistress of congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck). I liked the movie, it has nice moments of suspense, surprising plot twists, and a decent story. However, it kind of goes to far in the end, and I would have preferred if it ended 10 minutes earlier, instead of revealing another, pretty ridiculous, twist.\n\nI really need to see more South Korean films, as far as I remember, this is only the second one I've seen, the first being Oldboy. The Chaser follows Joong-ho Eom, a cop turned pimp, whose prostitutes have started disappearing. He discovers that it always happens in one area of town, with one customer, who he believes is selling the girls. The audience quickly discover that, that is not the case (the girls are brutally murdered), but Eom doesn't know. First of all it's refreshing to see a protagonist whose motivations are different from what we usually see. He's losing money, and that's why he wants to find the girls. Secondly, I just love Koreans, or the way the they act in movies anyway. Granted, I haven't seen many movies, but their just funny. They always slap each other when they're mad\u2026\n\nNord follows a depressed caretaker of a small ski lift, in a desolate, Norwegian area. When his home burns down he embarks on a journey to see his daughter and former wife. The movie reminded me of The Straight Story, and it is a similarly sweet and touching road movie. Most of the actors had never acted before, and the movie is shot on location, making it seem very natural, and real.\n\nSince I'm a huge fan of Lukas Moodyson (Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l, Lilja 4-ever) I was really looking forward to his new movie, Mammut. Moodyson has been making some more experimental movies the recent years, and this is his return to more mainstream audiences, unfortunately it's not a very good return. I have nothing against social realism, but this movie is excruciatingly boring, most of the conflicts are very minor, and some of the crucial choices of the characters seem unmotivated.\n\nThe master of stop motion, Henry Selick, returns after 13 years. In a time of where CGI has become common, it is very refreshing to see a movie like this. Selick is a mastermind, and I was so impressed by how incredible this movie looked. This was also my first feature-length film in 3D, and this is probably a perfect movie to see in 3D. It seemed more like a play, with the dolls prancing around on a stage. It's also pretty cool to hear people's reaction to seeing stuff in 3D for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, it's got a nice, scary story, and amazing voice acting.\n\nI have looked forward to this movie for months. Danny Boyle and Darren Aronofsky are probably my favorite directors at the moment, but I wasn't overjoyed with Slumdog Millionaire. The Wrestler did, however, fulfill my expectations, amazing acting, amazing story, solid movie."}

Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook' is so refreshing: we haven't encountered these characters before, and this is a character-driven piece. They're unpredictable and idiosyncratic, but recognizably real. Even the neighborhood cop doesn't talk or behave like a stock movie policeman."}

{"text":"RED LIKE THE SKY is inspired by the true story of Mirco Mencacci, one of the most gifted Italian sound editors working today, who happens to be blind. A small village in Tuscany, 1971. Mirco is a bright, lively 10-year-old, crazy about the movies - especially Westerns and adventure films. His father, an incurable idealist, is a truck driver. One day, while Mirco is playing with an old rifle, the gun accidentally goes off; the boy is shot in the head. He survives, but loses his sight. At that time, Italian law considered blind people hopelessly handicapped, and did not permit them to attend public school. Hence, young Mirco's parents are forced to shut their son up in a \"special school for the blind\": the David Chiossone Institute in Genoa. In the beginning Mirco does not accept his new condition. But he is feisty and determined. Then he finds an old tape recorder and a few used reels...\n\nI understand now why you, Andy, fought for so long to bring us this movie and I truly appreciate your efforts because it was worth the wait.\n\nWhy when we grow up do we lose the ability to simplify our lives and lack seeing the beauty in the world that those without sight can and who \"see\" the world far clearer than those with sight do? This movie was so inspiring and such a pleasant reminder that we should really \"stop and smell the roses\" and not give up on things or rather people who might be different than others. There is a very good message in this movie and I wish more people could view this film in hopes to spread that sentiment.\n\n15-Nov-12: Jim - Rating: 5\n\nThe movie starts with what seemed like a poorly contrived accident. It's a curious boy and a loaded gun which results in a tragedy to a real person. From there on it pulls you in to the difficult transition from a sighted to a blind young boy. The feel of this small village setting to the school for the blind was a shock well translated by the film. Difficult minding by the staff and the almost happy accident of finding a tape recorder soon lead to inspiration and a creative outlet for Mirco. His small rebellion and friendship with Francesca are both innocent and believable. His experiences with the school bully become a nice surprise. A fantastic story well told in film. Why it isn't available in NTSC 1 format in English subtitles for the American market is hard to understand. I loved it and it was a happy tear I shed for this story.\n\n14-Nov-12: judy s - Rating: 5\n\nThanks Andy. Masterly. Memorable. Magical.\n\n13-Nov-12: Jim - Rating: 5\n\nWow wow wow! This movie is clearly the reason I belong to the cinema society! What a wonderful film! The magic of \"seeing\" the world through kid eyes. The best of the human spirit. Andy, you called it when you noted that none of the kids were acting, they just were. So thankful you were able to show us this film. And what a loss for the rest of the country that they won't see it."}
{"text":"\"Hmmm. He seems\nattractive...and stupid. Perhaps he will take me to Kate\nand Leopold.\"\n\nA French Take on the Life of an Eccentric\nYet Single Woman.\n\nIf I can say nothing else, the new French film Amelie\nis very sweet. The film captures a childhood innocence\nthat is very oddball in sensibility yet still remains to be\nfun and sexy. But candy is also very sweet. And sometimes\ntoo much candy can make your stomach hurt. That's kind of\nthe only way I can describe the feeling I had after walking\nout of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's take on the fantasy world of a\nlong distance crush. The romantic misadventures and childlike\npranks and tricks are very well done and clever the first\nfew times. But it's as though the script was afraid that the\naudience would not understand the Austen-esque story unless\nwe got to see every setpiece more than a couple of times.\n\nAmelie (Audrey Tautou) was born and raised in a household\nwith very little love. The only time Dad, who was a retired\nArmy doctor, gave her any kind of attention was when he was\ndoing his weekly physical exam. So, every time he did this,\nher heart beat extra fast so he assumed she had a medical\nproblem. As a teenager, Amelie moved to the city to work at\na small and quaint cafe. And still, she cannot find a man\nthat will give her the love that she longed from her father\nfor so long. Then, on the day of Princess Di's death, she\ndiscovers a box of childhood items that belonged to a former\nresident of her apartment. The joy that she sees on his face\nupon receiving the memorabilia gives her a new mission in\nlife: To find people out who are longing for something, to\nfind the thing the people long for, and then to unite both\nin a fun, game-like fashion. Indeed, this becomes quite a\nhobby for the young Amelie. One day, she finds an album devoted\nto ripped-up photographs from asidewalk booth. She learns\nthrough her research that the album belongs to Nino (Matheui\nKassovitz), a quirky young man who had a very similar childhood\nto Amelie who now spends his time split between arranging\ndildos at a local porn store and working in the haunted house\nof a fun fair. Will these two lost souls get together and\nCO-inhabit the same fantasy world? Perhaps, but there is a\nlot of stopping and starting before the film ever gets to\nthat point.\n\nI found that this film worked the best whenever it visualized\nthe imagination of children. The earlier scenes of Amelie\nand her imaginary friends have a bit of wonder while remaining\nmindful of her total and complete loneliness. This imagination\nfollows her desire for daddy's love into her early twenties\nyet they grow up a bit as well. When Amelie fantasizes about\nher life, she sometimes sees herself as Zorro in an adventure\nor as an explorer going to the North Pole. Even her challenge\nof bringing people happiness has the feel of a mischief playing\nLost and Found. While she's watching these people fall in\nlove or become reunited, the question of \"Will Amelie\never love again\" floats around like it will never hit\nthe ground. When Nino does respond to Amelie, she merely backs\naway. Then, she reaches out again and then backs away. Why\ndoes she do this? Sadly, the filmmaker never really allows\nus to know the main character very well. Most of the film\nis done through narration. We hear other people's reaction\nto Amelie and we see her blossom into a princess of joy while\na real Princess is being buried. (As a side note, I found\nthe film's observation of people's reaction to Di's and Mother\nTeresa's death, both died within days of one another to be\nquite telling and funny.) Yet we never hear her. We never\neven to get to understand much about her or about what makes\nher tick. So, when true love does come along, it's baffling\nas to why she keeps pulling away. Eventually, it no longer\nseems quirky or sweet and it ends up feeling like broccoli-flavored\nmedicine .\n\nI'll never understand why movies and\/or TV shows do this.\nAre we supposed to find love to be as much of a nonsensical\ngame as these people do? It seems that very early on Amelie\nplaces its finger on what love is: It comes from innocent\nwonder or from the touch of someone who cares. But it still\nfeels like the whole film is search for this type of love.\nThe structure for the film ends up not like Austen but more\nlike two seasons of Ally McBeal making funny faces at her\nneurotic fantasies while romance drifts back and forth out\nof her life. For the most part, Amelie plays pretty\nwell as a film that asks us to look for all of the lovely\nthings in life. In the end, its most telling scene is when\nNino finds out who the mysterious character that keeps popping\nup in his photo album is. It turns out to be fairly silly\nexplanation and not what he made it out to be in his head.\nFor later reference, a scene like that should never define\na movie."}
{"text":"Hysteria\n\nGiven its ostensibly titillating, ostensibly feminist subject matter, you may have heard a certain buzz around Hysteria, the new film, directed by Tanya Wexler, that chronicles the birth of a certain beloved piece of machinery that has ministered many a horny human toward sexual completion, whether alone or in sympathetic company. But the vibrations emanating from this facile, half-farcical period exercise in patting viewers on the back for being more enlightened than the average Victorian tight-ass are not the good kind. The novelty of the premise and the accompanying tired plot mechanics wear off faster than the glow of a purely utilitarian, too-hurried self-serve orgasm, and the Merchant-Ivory meets Benny Hill humour is limper than a dirty sock.\n\nThe film, scripted by Stephen Dyer and Jonah Lisa Dyer, is loosely based on the true story of one Mortimer Granville, played here by Hugh Dancy. Granville was a doctor and an idealist who lands a gig helping a fellow physician perform vulvar massages on patients suffering from hysteria. Apparently it was presumed that an overactive uterus was the most common cause of that demeaning and widely diagnosed (to women almost exclusively) malady that plagued London back in the day. The big repeated gag is that these guys somehow don't understand that they're essentially handing out handjobs to sexually frustrated society ladies, not even when these ladies are furiously writhing and moaning as they reach \"satisfactory paroxysm.\" Ha ha.\n\nMeanwhile, there's Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a suffragette who works with the city's downtrodden. Charlotte and Mortimer initially get off on the wrong foot, which means we'll have to wait a while for the movie to force them into each other's orbit of endearment as it awkwardly applies a few screwball tropes. But the romance is just the sideshow to the main attraction: the rise of the vibrator, something that may never have occurred if Mortimer and his finger-popping colleagues didn't suffer such debilitating hand cramps. By the finale even Queen Victoria gets her kicks courtesy of the little love machine. A pretty lame movie, but it certainly has a happy ending"}
{"text":"'Just Cause' is a liberal dose of inverted politics\n\nFebruary 17, 1995|By Stephen Hunter | Stephen Hunter,Sun Film Critic\n\nGlimcher, who has a fine sense of milieu and truly captures the seediness of Ocochobee, hasn't much luck with action; it's all banal and predictable. Worse yet, wasn't Scorsese in the same jungle in his liberal deconstruction movie, \"Cape Fear,\" just a few years ago?\n\nOther flaws intrude. There's a planted murder weapon and for the life of me, I cannot figure out who, by the very logic of the plot, could have planted it. In fact, generally, there's too much plot: A connection to Connery's wife is forced and a degradation worked upon a prisoner feels unbelievable.\n\nFinally there's Connery himself. Hulking and radiating strength, he never really seems comfortable with the part of a man of passionate ideals but little practical skill, though almost certainly it was his commitment to it that got the movie made. But he never transcends his screen persona to become something new. I kept thinking how much more believable it would have been with someone other than a tattooed (Scotland Forever!) ex-Royal Navy Mr. Universe contestant, with a cinema baggage of three decades of mayhem behind him. James Bond, a liberal? Give me break!"}
{"text":"Cast & Crew\n\nMargaret Atwood's highly regarded novel came to the screen in 1990 in an uneven yet still gripping production (newly released on DVD). Natasha Richardson makes perhaps the biggest impact in her career as Offred, the \"handmaid\" at the center of a dystopic future where ultra-right wing factions are in control of the government, martial law rules, and biological agents have rendered 99% of women sterile. Those women who are still fertile and have been convicted of some crime, however ridiculous, become handmaids, stripped from their lives and sentenced to service the remaining rich and powerful, whose wives can't conceive children.\n\nOffred finds herself at the mercy of a good-natured but subtly manipulative commander (Robert Duvall) and his faded-star wife Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway). And soon enough she slips her way into an underground aiming to overthrow the fascist regime.\n\nAtwood's tale is brilliant, but a little something is missing in its translation to the screen. The major flaw is with the direction by Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff (Palmetto, tons of German films you've never heard of), who isn't exactly the most renowned director on the planet and is considerably out of his element with this extremely challenging material. The movie ends up as a good one, but the nearly-farcical future-shock makes you inevitably compare it to Brazil, and that's a comparison that few films can stand up to. Never mind the directing talent, Schl\u00f6ndorff simply doesn't have the budget to pull off a realistic version of even the near-future. The movie is fairly solid up until Offred's wholesale recruitment into the resistence, whereupon the film starts to slip into oddity.\n\nThe ending comes suddenly, reminding us that two hours have passed and we haven't reached a resolution. And it doesn't entirely satisfy, either. The ending feels way too much like the \"happy ending\" tacked onto Brazil -- and which ultimately became a cinematic joke (see the Criterion release of that film for an in-depth look at this phenomenon). Still, it's a pretty good movie if for no other reason than its sheer guts at calling out the religious right while still maintaining a sense of sophistication. That's rare indeed."}

{"text":"Blu-ray Review: A Mighty Heart\n\nBased on the heartbreaking true story of kidnapped and murdered Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, A Mighty Heart is a gripping film that's especially moving due to its basis in fact.\n\nDaniel (Dan Futterman) is in Pakistan, with his wife Mariane (Angelina Jolie), reporting on terrorism in the region. He's promised a meeting with a prominent sheik, but never comes home, launching an investigation into his disappearance fueled by hope, but fearing the worst. Daniel's kidnappers proclaim that he is really an American CIA agent posing as a journalist, and the threat of death seems imminent.\n\nAt the core of the investigation is Mariane, pregnant and determined to get her husband back alive. Jolie's performance is strong, despite an accent that tends to drop in and out. Her quiet resilience is under constant attack from an impending hopelessness, and Jolie is excellent at conveying this mounting pressure until her emotions reach a crescendo in the film's climactic scene. Both cathartic and devastating, this is powerful stuff from Mrs. Brad Pitt.\n\nDirector Michael Winterbottom (The Road to Guantanamo) approaches the film with the goal of realism, appropriately. Confusion is ever-present in the narrative, with a large and ever-growing cast of characters that may be involved in Daniel's kidnapping. It's difficult to get a handle on what actually happened, which is often the way reality works.\n\nWinterbottom's natural style and handheld camera work is a good example of how the format can be effective without being overly jarring or distracting. The film maintains an almost constant layer of suspense, despite the outcome being known going in, and much of that is due to the excellent direction.\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc\n\nA Mighty Heart is presented in 1080p high definition with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. This is a film that has a lot of natural grain due to its visual style, and it's nearly always apparent to some degree or another here. The color palette is mostly pale, dull even, leaving few shots where any particular color stands out. Skin tones and black levels appear to be consistent throughout, and picture clarity and sharpness are generally strong, but there's little remarkable about the visual presentation. It's an upgrade from standard definition, but the film just doesn't lend itself to high def greatness."}
{"text":"The 20-year-old Hubble Space Telescope--whose repair mission is the subject of this chronicle--turns out to be a bit of a stage hog, and audiences expecting a blissout of swirling galaxies will wonder why so much time is spent on astronauts sweating over screws and boltsSo why is this songwriter, so articulate on vinyl, so vague and spacey in current-day interviews? Something happened here, deeper than an aborted quest for fame, and the documentary hasn't gotten to it.\n\nJustice is blind - but there are cases where fingers start weighing down the scales. That's the j'accuse that Ra'anan Alexandrowicz's documentary puts forth regarding Israel's rule of law in its post-'67 occupied territories\n\nRedemptively, the cast goes a long way: Jean Desailly is perfect as a jowly literary celeb deep in midlife crisis, while the aloof Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac is magnetic as his airline stewardess and all-too-scrutable love object.\n\nShe has real sympathy--characters that might have been brittle, mockable creations in another writer-director's hands gain resonance here. But the filmmaker also might have very little to say apart from the way guilt enters into life, and then suddenly recedesNew Yorkers and those who've been following the neighborhood's plight know exactly how this ends; at the very least, Paravel and Sniadecki have preserved the memory of what was. Sometimes, that's the most you can do.\n\nThere has to be room for this kind of plea, especially a work that, obliquely, captures so many largely unreported details: the night raids rounding up children, the torn-up olive trees and kids' soccer games in the battle zone.\n\nGrand scale or no, this feels like a blockbuster on autopilot more often than not, curiously detached and self-importantly somber even by the director's standards - and without the cerebral heft of his best work.\n\nIn narrative terms, it's mostly an excuse to work in a trio of crooks whose banter may be even better than that of our hero; Mark Strong's disgusted rant about paying off policemen and Liam Cunningham \u2013 led musings on Bobbie Gentry's \"Ode to Billie Joe\" are enough to justify the entire movie on their own.\n\nThe director illuminates how the town's racial and economic dynamics have changed, while simultaneously reflecting on the ethics of nonfiction filmmaking. It's a powerful testament to how far we both have and haven't come.\n\nIt probably would have helped if Walker (who credits two other codirectors) had chosen just one of those avenues for deeper study; her doc has a vertiginous way of feeling arty and ephemeral at one moment, humane and maybe too earthbound the next."}
{"text":"Movie Trailers\n\nMovie Photos\n\nA Simple Plan, starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thorton (nominated for an Academy Award for this movie), Bridget Fonda, and Brent Brisco, is a thriller from director Sam Raimi. The movie's title describes the plot perfectly, but, of course, as in all these kinds of movies, things don't go as planned. What started out as a simple crime ends up as a web of deceit, murder, and paranoia, and A Simple Plan takes a slightly more unique approach.\n\nWhile a lot of these movies seem to entail characters that are deceitful from the beginning and purposely kill to get away with whatever they're stealing (usually money), A Simple Plan's characters are innocent, at least at the beginning. Paxton's character starts out reluctant but quickly - almost too quickly - changes to the deceiving side. He spends a whole scene telling his more simplistic pals, his brother Jacob (Thorton) and his friend Lou (Brisco), that they shouldn't tell anybody, including their wives. But almost instantly, Paxton reveals the money to his wife, and very shortly after, she joins in. She further complicates things by suggesting he do things to keep the money under wraps. Paxton willingly obeys and more problems ensue, like murder.\n\nThorton is the most respectable of the group. A little on the slow side, he wants to take the money just because he found it. There really was no greed behind him other than that he couldn't resist four million in cash (who could?). He ends up regretting his mistake but cannot break out of the conspiracy.\n\nThe acting is great in A Simple Plan but the characters are sort of stupid. Stupid as in a personality trait. Even Paxton, the smartest of the group, makes a lot of stupid mistakes. These guys are constantly letting things slip, constantly acting nervous, and constantly wrecking their possibility of making it by doing stupid things.\n\nA Simple Plan has a good story and good actors, but sometimes the mistakes that are made in the film are just a little too stupid. And the movie can lag in parts."}
{"text":"EW Movie Review: \"Red Tails\"\n\nLucasfilm's \"Red Tails\" soars when it comes to special effects, but the human-to-human drama feels like it's stuck on the runway. Entertainment Weekly contributing critic Owen Gleiberman filed the following review.\n\nIt's been 26 years since \"Top Gun,\" but the dogfights in that absurdly entertaining Reagan-era classic have lost none of their speed-demon zap. That said, \"Top Gun\" lets you know that you're basically watching a video game with actors. Not so with \"Red Tails,\" a lavishly square historical drama about the Tuskegee Airmen, the very first African-American military pilots, who served in segregated units during World War II.\n\nThe movie has potent sequences of aerial combat that recall Tom Cruise and his flyboys bombarding evil out of the air. Here, though, the planes zoom close to the ground, with the tree-lined hills of Italy looming up behind them. The actors really appear to be flying, and that gives the airmen's brushes with the enemy\u2014even when they're just providing \"escort\" cover for white pilots\u2014a heart-in-the-throat, you-are-there quality. Plus, they finally do get to blow up a few Nazi planes.\n\nAs long as it stays in the air, \"Red Tails\" is a compelling sky-war pageant of a movie. On the ground, though, this George Lucas production is a far shakier experience: dutiful and prosaic, with thinly scripted episodes that don't really add up to a satisfying story.\n\nThe scenes of racial conflict, like one set at a white officers' club, are vivid illustrations of what the airmen were up against, and Terrence Howard, as the colonel who argues for their right to see combat, is defiant in an enjoyably savvy, high-command way. The young British actor David Oyelowo plays Joe \"Lightning\" Little, the Cruise-ian daredevil who must to learn to fly in support of his team, and his cocky bravado is desperate and humane. But just about everyone else in the cast achieves one or two eager dimensions rather than three."}
{"text":"Brief: Muroga reclaims for Japan, what Clint and Sergio borrowed in the 1960's.\n\nIf the inspiration for this one wasn't clear, Goro Yasukawa's score will soon enlighten you: Sergio Leone. A character with a mysterious past and equally obscure agenda comes into a lawless town, and kicks ass. For The Man With No Name and his horse, read Saki (Yonekura) and her Harley. Given that Leone basically ripped off Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo in A Fistful of Dollars to begin with, the irony is satisfying. She has come to Tsuson - surely a nod to Tucson, less than two hours down the dusty Arizona I-10 from where I write this - to take on Tojo (Tsurumi), the local mob boss, who commits his crimes with impunity from the safety of an American Air Force base. She gets his attention when she interferes with his robbery of a wages truck, and takes the money herself. The two had met previously, though Tojo doesn't recognise Saki; you'll probably work out the basic circumstances long before the film reveals them, but it does add a couple of unexpectedly nasty twists of the knife.\n\nThe Okinawan setting is interesting, given tension between US forces there and the locals, dating back to a 1995 incident when three servicemen raped a 12-year old girl. Hence, the scene where Yuki demolishes two leering US soldiers has an additional level of resonance for local viewers, and the tolerance of the Americans to a brutal thug on their territory become somewhat more explicable. Yonekura is impressive in her role, and Muroga wisely doesn't bother to introduce any love interest; the film is barely an hour long, so there just wouldn't be room. The inevitability of the final Suki-Tojo faceoff is perhaps only exceeded by its ludicrousness - the heroine expands the definition of \"unarmed\" to include other limbs too. However, for an obviously low-budget work, it's busily energetic, and rarely slides much below entertaining."}

{"text":"Parents say\n\nKids say\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nParents need to know that while this movie's content is squeaky-clean (with sexuality limited to a few brief kisses), the plot behind the songs and dances is racier than that of the typical musical, featuring romantic complications, infidelity, and a predatory female character who seems intent on turning Gene Kelly's character into a gigolo. Younger kids probably won't get the innuendos, while older ones may be a bit discomfited by the romantic duplicity of the film's characters.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nTriple threat Gene Kelly acts, sings, and dances beautifully in this eye-catching musical laced with Gershwin songs and gorgeous dance numbers. Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) is a former WWII soldier who stayed in Paris after the war ended to pursue his love of painting. A wealthy divorcee (Nina Foch) has offered to be his patron, though she's clearly interested more in Jerry himself than his work. Meanwhile, Jerry has fallen for a pretty French dancer (Leslie Caron, in her screen debut), and is having trouble choosing between financial security and passion.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nThe song-and-dance segments are the main appeal of AN AMERICAN IN PARIS particularly Gershwin's 17-minute title piece, accompanied by a lengthy ballet built around the main characters. It's a knockout, and a good thing, too, because the plot is nothing to write home about.\n\nThe characters are silly, duplicitous, and grasping, and resemble nothing so much as cardboard cutouts meant to push a plot along in between musical numbers. But what does it matter, when the songs are so delicious (particularly \"S'Wonderful\" and \"I Got Rhythm\") and the dancing so infectious? Lavish sets, gorgeous costumes, great music -- this one's a feast for the eyes and ears, not for the brainGood for what it is:\n\nA 50+ year old musical with mediocre acting. It is interesting visually, but the ending is a ridiculously long number that is 100% unneeded. Mostly for Kelly's fans, or real old movie buffs.

{"text":"Circuit interruptus.\n\nMenu\n\nDaily Archives: September 5, 2007\n\nThe reckoning is here! The scoring is very arbitrary and specific for these films, but the last set of figures represent things I've found I look for in every movie. Production values are something that often mean nothing (the best looking movie can still be shit), but it's where I'll give bonus points for nice photography or an excellent score. Unique selling points account for cool moments that cannot be classified otherwise. Oh, and sorry for using an obnoxious corporate phrase.\n\nAs for liveliness, a degree of coherent energy can make up for a lot of other failures, and by that I don't mean crazy pace. Something slow-paced, e.g. Jonathan Glazer's widely hated Birth (off the top of my head), barely moves at all, but there is an intelligence and plan for maximum effectiveness to that film that many films lack despite the frenetic editing or stunt-packed explosiveness or otherwise skillful filmmaking. It's just apparent there's some attention to pacing beyond making individual scenes work in a certain way, something that extends from committed and thoughtful performances on set down to the arc of the movie, and whether it works as a progressive ebb and flow from the first moment to the last, i.e. has the director figured out the movie's parts and whole from a God position instead of just focusing on the money shots, for lack of a better word. It sounds silly and nitpicky, but I'm always surprised at how many talented or untalented directors nowadays can't be bothered to figure that out. ::shakes cane at whippersnappers on their skateboards::\n\nUgh, it's something I've been thinking about for a while, and hope to explain better in the future, as well as come up with a better word for it. Not right now, though. We've got facing\/off to do.\n\nI will admit, kneejerk dislike of the leads didn't help here, but as much as Schreiber and Thewlis get on my nerves, I'll admit they're talented, intelligent actors (cursed though they are with sinuses that function as reverb chambers). Here, though, they just give up, sleepwalking through the movie with just enough awareness to point their faces in the right direction. Gambon and Farrow bring it back through sheer insane effort, but John Moore really wasn't paying attention to some of the performances, and thus we get a mixture of apathy and shrill annoyance.\n\nYes, Thewlis' death was great fun, but once cinema has offered the sight of someone sliced into pieces by a flying wire fence (as in Final Destination 2), or a skull chopped into pieces by a dislodged engine (as in Final Destination 3), you've got to try hard to top it.\n\nLowest scores possible for originality, as it's pretty much a Van Santing of the original movie. As for cliche, perhaps it's a bit unfair to judge the script on that, but Moore offers nothing directorially that could sway me. Everything is filmed exactly the way you would expect it. As for offering something you can't get elsewhere, you've got the superior original and the macabre Final Destination trilogy, which not only loses the religious guff (a secular horror movie about fate!) but presents pregnancy as something positive and hope-inspiring. That those movies are horribly bleak is both an unfortunate side effect and a USP. ::sigh:: I really like those movies. Omen overall total: -69\n\nA truly appalling, cynical cash-in movie, and further casting doubt on the ability of John Moore to create anything memorable in his career, other than the awesome plane crash scenes in Behind Enemy Lines and Flight of the Phoenix.\n\nFor all the film's faults, Hopkins did get a bunch of talented actors and didn't get in their way too much, as opposed to Moore's higgledy-piggledy approach. Swank especially tries hard. I just can't hate on her. Her taste in projects is often way off, but she commits to it, at least. Andrea Frankle, playing Robb's mother, was in the movie enough to register, but was given nothing to do other than be a red herring. She might be good given something to do, but here she was ill-served.\n\nPlot elements specific to this film: Elegant transmission of exposition: -2 Crazy deaths: -2 Ridiculous character names: 0 Grasp of London geography: N\/A (If you could see the London Eye above the bayou, it would win hands down.) Fair treatment of women\/reproduction: -10 Avoidance of lazy dream sequences: -7 Survival of ethnic sidekick until final frame: -7\n\nTotal = -28\n\nIf only this film had a Bugenhagen, or death by satellite-crashing, it would register more. Instead the earnestness swamps anything, with only the staging of the locust scene making an impression. It's the only proof that the crew were awake during the planning of the movie. However, see below.\n\nNot as cynical as The Omen, and certainly the dour atmosphere tends to suggest Hopkins thought he was making something more than a silly potboiler, but it doesn't hide the lack of imagination, not to mention the derivative script. It rips off many better movies, and the best scene in it, i.e. the locust attack, is nowhere near as emotionally affecting or dramatic as the locust scenes at the end of Days of Heaven. Completely different film, but infinitely more compelling. Some nice photography and effects, though. Reaping overall total = -48\n\nBland to the point of barely existing. It looks a lot better than it should, but it's a film that just didn't need to be made. Not that that's a bad thing; lots of films don't need to be made, but they can still transcend that and become something great. A half-hearted rehashing of better plots without the wit or imagination to rework them, play homage to them, or push them to an insane level of melodramatic hysteria, is not what I have in mind, though.\n\nSo, in a fairish fight, The Reaping wins through superior acting and some nice production values. But as you can see from the score, it's a Pyrrhic victory. In fact, here is an accurate representation of the Biblical Horror Movie Fightbot Face\/Off, from Stuart Gordon's massively entertaining Robot Jox.\n\nOh, the humanity! Those final shots show what me and Canyon's brains were like once the movies were over. Damn you biblical horror movies! We should have rewatched Exorcist III. And pooed ourselves with fear."}

{"text":"Wag the Dog (1997) is one of those 90s movies you somehow missed. I don't know how I did, but I recently came across it looking for something along the lines of propaganda and psychological warfare in film, and boy was I in for a treat. Wag the Dog is dark satire and is far more than I expected it to be. The film is about private intelligence consultants\/marketing experts creating a fake war as a distraction during a presidential candidate's re-election that is racked by scandal.\n\nRobert deNiro plays Conrad Brean, \"Mr. Fix It,\" the intelligence\/media manipulator hired to create a big distraction that ends up being a fake war with \"Albanian fundamentalist terrorists.\" There are several people this might be, and it could also be a composite, but given his hat and appearance, E. Howard Hunt immediately comes to mind, though the timing is off.\n\nWhile most analyses of the film would focus on the film's narrative itself as an expose, which is true as far as it goes, I\"d like to take a step back and point out that it is more than that. It's an example of what I'd call meta-propaganda, in the sense that metanarrative in the study of Shakespeare involves a story about the process of writing a story, so with Wag the Dog we have an example of meta-propaganda. The film is itself propaganda about the process of making propaganda. This is the secret power and effect of predictive programming: hoodwinking a unknowing mass populace into accepting a manipulation of archetypes and emotional images that produce a desired effect.

He faces insurmountable odds and maintains his sanity\nthrough his love of music.\n\nOne of the things that appealed to me most was the incredible way it\nwas shot. Director Roman Polanski and his cinematographer Pawel Edelman\nwork together to create a muted palette that dulls and livens the visuals\nat the same time. Even though the story follows Szpilman (played by Adrien\nBrody) virtually exclusively, there is an overwhelming sense of voyeurism.\nI couldn't help but feel I was intruding into his life, despite\nthe fact that the majority of the film is shown from his perspective\n(of course I don't mean first person camera work). The audience\nis as enclosed and as trapped as Szpilman.\n\nWe want to reach out and help him. Give him some of the popcorn and\ncandy we eat while we watch him scrounging for food. Invite him to sleep\non the couch we observe him from. Yet, while we enjoy the luxuries of\nour daily life, we can at least begin or pretend to empathize with him,\nand we can surely applaud the courage required to overcome that unspeakable\ntime.\n\nA lot of credit is due to the actors. Brody is astounding. He not only\nplayed a couple of complex songs on the piano, he also played a complex\nset of emotions: both to near perfection. I never had to question any\ncharacter's motivation. All that is required is to look at the\nactor's face and all would be understood perfectly. Even the thousands\nof extras stood out to me as giving great performances. The deaths were\nnot stagy. They were gritty, understated and very effective.\n\nIf you don't know that the film is based on Szpilman's actual\nstory (his book was adapted by screenwriter Ronald Harwood), it may be\ntough to believe some of the events. A couple of the situations seemed\nto be a little too convenient and hard to swallow. However, assuming\nthat the movie is essentially true to life, it makes his harrowing story\nthat much more incredible.\n\nNo one my age could ever possibly truly begin to understand what living\nin a time such as that was like for someone of any nationality, let alone\nthe amazing struggles the European Jewish people had to endure. \"The\nPianist\" is a remarkable piece of work that touches your heart\nand soul.

{"text":"Joann Sfar, the director of Gainsbourg (Vie H\u00e9ro\u00efque), did not set out to direct a film about Serge Gainsbourg the man, or even Serge Gainsbourg the musician; he wanted to capture the Gainsbourg he saw in his dreams. Sfar wrote on his website that the film would resemble \"a fairy tale\" rather than the Vie en Rose-style biopic that many anticipated; instead of recounting the songwriter's life in a convincing, if conventional, manner, his film would be a phantasmagorical homage, unafraid of blatant omissions and fabrications. \"I see him as a new archetype,\" wrote Sfar of Gainsbourg, \"one as complex as Cyrano, Don Juan, or Albert Cohen's Solal\u2026I want to speak about the poetic reasons why we identify with him.\"\n\nThe result of Sfar's experiment with unreality is an unusually flattering portrait of a public figure seldom remembered for his virtues. Gainsbourg was an alcoholic, a womanizer, a walking advertisement for unfiltered Gitanes; he chased after women 20 years his junior, talked a clueless France Gall into singing about a schoolgirl who sucks lollipops for loose change, and recorded \"Je T'aime, Moi Non Plus,\" a song so suggestive that the Vatican denounced it as profane. Gainsbourg was well known for seeking out trouble on every front, but in Sfar's portrayal, he comes across as more mischievous than misogynistic \u2014 a self-conscious young man who could never quite believe his luck when he had a date with a pretty girl.Throughout the film, we see Gainsbourg's tender side: Serge cooing at babies; Serge dropping a whiskey glass out of nervousness on Juliette Gr\u00e9co's floor; Serge eating pickles with his parents in their little Parisian kitchen.\n\nThe songwriter's much-documented decline is addressed too, albeit selectively: It is largely by omission that Sfar characterizes Gainsbourg as a lovable, dorky poet. Sfar's screenplay mercifully leaves out the singer's American TV appearance when he said, in what appeared to be a drunken stupor, that he wanted \"to fuck\" Whitney Houston. \"Lemon Incest,\" a truly atrocious song Serge recorded with his daughter Charlotte when she was 13, also goes unmentioned, as do the majority of his songs recorded after 1980.\n\n\"Stories online aren't really stories right now. They're like fragmentary reactions to things for the most part. They're like little nerve firings. Very rarely are they fully formed thoughts and expressions and so on. So, I think creating a space that's more about slowing down and contemplating and being introspective is a prerequisite for getting people to tell stories that have impact. When you design a space that encourages short, reactionary verse, people are going to give you short, reactionary verse. Maybe when you design a space that's not encouraging that, people will use more depth in their self-expression.\"\u2014Jonathan Harris (PopTech 2007), quoted on design mind (via somethingchanged)"}

{"text":"Hopkins turns in a good caricature performance, his identity completely obscured by prosthetics, makeup and an alteration to his voice. He carries the film well enough and embodies Alfred Hitchcock to the same degree, but it's hardly Hopkins' best role.\n\nHitchcock is moderately entertaining as it focuses on the filmmaker's motivations and desires surrounding the creation of his controversial classic, but it lacks identity - somewhat ironic given the subject matter. The movie has a lighthearted tone - it begins with serial killer Ed Gein murdering his brother in a humorous way - but not a comedic one, leaving the story and its characters to flounder in edgeless drama. By using bright colors and refusing to give his actors - Scarlett Johansson, Danny Huston, Toni Collette, Jessica Biel and James D'Arcy among them - much to bite into, director Sacha Gervasi handicaps his film out of the gate.\n\nHitchcock needed an identity, a unique one. Had Gervasi shot it like a Hitchcock film - with strong angles, a piercing score and a tendency toward suspense - he might have had something. Or, had he committed to a genre - say, as a comedy, where the characters are exaggerations of themselves, or as a drama, where the story dives deeper into Hitchcock's obsession with perfection and his alleged affinity for his lovely leading ladies - the movie would have had a better chance.\n\nAs is, it's entertaining but unremarkable, normal when it should be anything but. Gervasi attempts to be unique by diving into Hitchcock's mind with flashbacks to Ed Gein's murders, but these moments are the least effective parts of the movie.\n\nThe film's saving grace is Helen Mirren, who plays Hitchcock's wife and collaborator. Mirren is terrific and grounds the film. The casting of James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins was also superb.\n\nHitchcock is not a bad movie, but it is about one of the greatest filmmakers of our time... So why does the film feel so normal?"}
{"text":"Starting out like a gentle family melodrama, this gorgeously made Japanese film morphs into something much darker as it progresses. And in both its economic premise and family observations, it couldn't be any timelier.\n\nRyuhei (Kagawa) manages a busy office and is so stunned when he's made redundant that he doesn't tell his wife Megumi (Koizumi). He pretends to go to work every day, hanging out near a homeless centre with an unemployed friend (Tsuda). Meanwhile, Megumi is battling her own inner demons, wishing her life wasn't so dull. And their sons have problems too: teen Takashi (Koyanagi) decides to join the US military in Iraq, while preteen Kenji (Inowaki) spends his lunch money on piano lessons, discovering that he's a prodigy.\n\nKurosawa opens with an Ozu-style shot of domestic tranquillity before unpeeling everything down to bare bone. It becomes a kind of kitchen sink horror film, as each character is pushed to the brink emotionally and physically. And what makes this film remarkable is the fact that they all travel this path on their own, too proud or afraid to reach out for any help, right to the achingly beautiful finale. This biting comment on modern society (not just Japan's) is thoroughly unnerving.\n\nThe cast members give strong, transparent performances that highlight hidden emotions. Even as the plot spirals into overwrought scenes of emotion, pain and fear, the film remains stately and cool. This matter-of-fact approach cleverly shows everyday situations warping into something extraordinary. Dreams of an unruffled, happy life vanish in a moment. Ryuhei wants just a shred of dignity, Megumi wishes she could wake up and be someone else, Kenji wants to do what he knows he should do, Takashi wants to control his destiny.\n\nAs everything is stripped away, each of them must find the strength to move forward. All of these things happen in beautifully staged scenes that resonate deeply. We know exactly what it's like to try to maintain some privacy and independence by hiding our true feelings.

{"text":"Martin Scorsese is a director of astonishing power and \"Gangs of New York\" is a movie of astonishing imagination, ambition, and scope. The first fifteen minutes are as dazzling as any images ever put on screen. The rest of the movie veers from brilliant to flawed, but it is unfailingly arresting, provocative, and powerful.\n\nScorsese has shown us his fascination with New York City (\"New York, New York,\" \"New York Stories,\" \"The Age of Innocence\") and with violence (\"Goodfellas\"). Both themes come together in this story of the origins of New York, in the Civil War era where it was not yet a city, but \"a furnace where a city might be forged.\"\n\nIn a brief prologue, the leader of a gang called the Dead Rabbits is killed by the leader of \"the natives\" (those who have been in the United States for generations) in a huge and brutal skirmish. His young son, Amsterdam Vallon, is taken to an orphanage\/reformatory. He returns twenty years later, determined to finish his father's fight.\n\nBy this time, the man who killed his father, Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) runs just about everything in the sprawling area called \"the Five Points.\" Even the legendary Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent), the real-life figure who presided over the most corrupt political machine in American history, has to ask Bill for his cooperation and support. Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) arrives in the Five Points. Bill the Butcher controls just about everything. Amsterdam recognizes some of his father's former supporters, including Happy Jack (John C. Reilly) and McGloin (\"Billy Elliot's\" Gary Lewis). The only one who recognizes him is Johnny (Henry Thomas of \"E.T.,\" in the year's worst haircut).\n\nAmsterdam becomes a part of Bill's inner circle, and finds himself drawn to him in spite of himself. Bill is magnetic and when he begins to treat Amsterdam like a son, the boy who lost his father cannot help but respond. As he says, \"It's a funny feeling being under the wing of a dragon. It's warmer than you think.\" Amsterdam also begins to care for a pickpocket\/thief, and sometimes prostitute named Jenny (Cameron Diaz).\n\nThe struggle between good and evil is represented throughout the movie at every level, from the internal struggles within Amsterdam to the massive battles between the immigrants and the natives. Scorsese also puts the combat in Five Points within the context of the riots in New York after the Union began conscripting soldiers. His reach is over-ambitious at times, but he has a sure hand with the narrative and fills each frame with splendid images. Who else would have P.T. Barnum's elephant lumbering through the city as combatants hurl themselves at each other? After the terrible fighting is over, Scorsese shows us how the city was delivered, in both senses of the word.\n\nSuperfluous voice-overs and flashbacks are very annoying, Thomas' character is poorly conceived, and Cameron Diaz, though game, is badly miscast. DiCaprio just manages to stay on top of his role, but Day-Lewis gives a career-topping performance of such ferocity that the character almost bursts out of the screen.\n\nParents should know that the movie is extremely violent, with savagely brutal battles and oceans of blood. Bill the Butcher uses his expertise to cause the most painful damage possible. Characters are badly wounded and killed, including a hanging. The movie also has very strong language, including the n-word and sexual references and situations, including nudity, prostitution, a character in bed with three naked women, and a reference to abortion. Characters engage in every possible kind of corruption and illegality.\n\nFamilies who see the movie should talk about how our history creates us. What does the movie tell you about present-day New York? Why does Amsterdam's father tell him to leave the blood on the blade and never to look away? How does Scorsese show us parallels between the different gangs and between the gangs and other groups, like the Tammany hall politicians and the draft protesters?\n\nFamilies who enjoy this movie will also enjoy \"Goodfellas.\" They also might want to find out more about some of the real-life historical characters in the movie, like P.T. Barnum and \"Boss\" Tweed"}
{"text":"The Facts of Life in 'Inception', 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', and 'The Matrix'\n\nChristopher Nolan's Inception was released last week to resounding praise, establishing the director as one of only a handful of cinematic artists whose name has become synonymous both with critical plaudits and box office hoohah. Yet the difference between Nolan and other auteurs of populist embrace is the consistent intellectualism of his vision. While the Spielbergs and Tarantinos wrench the viscera, Nolan tickles the cerebellum. His dialogue requires full attention, and he holds that attention by suspending threads of thought the way Hitchcock did emotions. Images of well-spoken men wearing dour expressions and designer suits have become to Nolan what terrycloth robes and light-sabers are to George Lucas or blood-spattered blades to Quentin Tarantino.\n\nHis ability to carve out brainy protagonists has become bankable even as applied to comic book heroes like Batman, the adventures of whom we can't help but feel in our gut but which under Nolan's tutelage we now consider with frontal lobes intact. Cinema is a felt medium, and most directors would play to that strength. Others, like Nolan, let the constructed thematic intricacies of their images carry equal weight as the easier-elicited, felt aspects. Nolan has earned the trust of his audience by playing to the smartest version of it, by working within a tradition of genre-bent stories that depend most upon the figuring out and thinking over.\n\nNolan's most recent fantasy can be cast against two other highly successful millennial fairy tales of that particular \"reality gone wacky\" vein, where visual perception of what is real becomes part and parcel of characters' story arc, the Michel Gondry-directed, Charlie Kaufman-penned Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and the Wachowski Brothers' information-age adventure, The Matrix. These films are an espionage\/\"long con\" story, a romantic comedy, and an adventure cum bildungsroman, respectively, movies marketed to different audiences, created for different effect, dressed in markedly different visual styles (can you imagine Carrie-Anne Moss's gothed-out Trinity, Jim Carrey's nerdified Joel Barish, and Leo DiCaprio's Cobb showing up to the same party? Neither can I).\n\nYet there is a commonality between them besides the fact that people's brains get fiddled with and stuff goes slightly sideways. Information, or lack of information, figures heavily as plot device in all three movies, and while the true pleasures of each film are mostly wrapped up in supposing how concepts of reality would be susceptible to alterations of human ability to understand them, this understanding revolves around missing bits of data and unknown facts which, once known, change everything.\n\nInception's densely woven tapestry of shared dreams and co-opted subconscious minds would read like the Mapquest of a hairball were it not for its \"long con\" McGuffin. A team of mentalist spies cut straight from 007's cloth are tasked with an impossible task, or so they inform us, the planting an original thought in their mark's mind. The movie doles out heaping spoonfuls of exposition around the backdrop of mental espionage, but things really pick up once the focus moves from extracting information to implanting it. Still more vital to Inception's burgeon of story is the DiCaprio character's unresolved marital issues and their implications in the stability of his team's shared dream world. Reality may be subject to the dreamer's mind, but what that dreamer knows or does not know (apparently) determines the rules of the game.\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind assigns equal importance to the knowledge of the dreamer, though for Jim Carrey's and Kate Winslet's characters this knowledge is a torment. They are a lovably toxic couple driven by each other to the brink of paying for the service of forgetting one other. Much of the movie traces this journey into imposed ignorance and seems, finally, to suggest that knowledge, or lack thereof, does not necessarily determine whom one loves.\n\nThe Matrix boasts two vital secrets turned plot device: The first one frames the Wachowski's whole imagined world, mainly that life as we know it is a computer program from which only a chosen few may break free by freeing their minds, (whatever that means.) The second is a kind of trick played on the movie's hero by an all-knowing Oracle. The film's story arc and the possibility of a Matrix sequel depend entirely on whether or not Neo is the One, (whatever that means.) The Oracle tells him that he's not, which of course somehow takes off the burden of \"oneness,\" enabling Neo to prove wrong the prophecy and fulfill his potential. A similar technique is practiced by soldiers who, facing battle, mentally count themselves as already dead, the idea being that as the pressure of survival is lifted the possibilities of bravery increase. The self-fulfilled prophecy of Neo's becoming the One is perpetuated on false information.\n\nThe appeal of Inception, as well as the long line of fantasies stories stretching from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to The Matrix, is to make us believe that reality is as pliable as a bit of newsprint cast upon silly putty, stretched and bent into an elongated version: \"There is no spoon,\" and so forth. And yet if these three examples tell us anything, it's the importance of conventional knowledge even in undone worlds. As reality gone sideways plays out within the interests of genre, information becomes the true lynchpin of all three story arcs. As the missing pieces of the genre puzzle emerge, and unknown facts become the driving force to Story, these movies become more ordinary against their mind-blowing backdrop, and also more effective. Good fantasy stories always provide inroads (and off-ramps) between the world in which we live and those imagined, and while cinematic reality can be bent to the whims of the CGI wizards, entertainment is always measured in terms of what works and what doesn't.\n\nWhat Christopher Nolan seems to get that a lot of other modern storytellers don't is that a story is essentially a mental exercise in suspended disbelief. Never mind the pitfalls of discriminating between fiction and non-fiction, abstract representation into story is the suspension of \"the real\" or \"what happens to be the case\" in lieu of a \"supposing.\" Even stories most connected to realism require the framing device of removed perspective, the volunteerism of directing one's attention to certain aspects of reality, certain pieces of the whole. Realism doesn't claim to represent reality but rather couches itself within the ethos of \"you were not there; you would not know without my telling,\" so that the telling becomes a \"supposing\" of real events.\n\nStill, while realism serves as the baseline of seeing outside of oneself into abstraction, fantasy extends this \"supposing\" to impossible things and not just \"things that happen not to be the case.\" The fantasy world runs alongside the abstract one, and the process of \"supposing\" inherent to the understanding of any story extends even further into genre. The fantasy exercise is extremely aesthetically rewarding, which no doubt speaks to why fairy tales are so popular; they are like that famous description of Casablanca's Rick Blaine, \"like most men [or stories] except moreso.\"\n\nInception is a wonderfully dizzying example of the kind of story we work to understand that equally rewards our efforts in the currency of an imagined world."}

{"text":"There's a character in this film named Charlie. He causes a remarkable amount of trouble, considering his remains are currently in a bait canister.\n\nCharlie is, of course, dead, and his remains are supposed to be scattered by his two best fishing buddies, JT and Hollis. The two men are supposed to scatter his ashes into their fishing spot, something they are reluctant to do.\n\nThe reason they don't want to scatter them is set up as a secret, and one that I won't spoil here. Previous to that revelation, the friends try to work out what it all means.\n\nIs there a heaven? Do we get what we deserve when we die? Is being old something that happens to you, or is it just a state of mind?\n\nWhat makes these questions troubling is that there are no answers to them anywhere in this life. These two characters, the people who made the movie, I, the writer, and you, the reader, all may have different answers to them, which is something the film acknowledges.\n\nWhere the film flounders is that it doesn't really provide anything new to chew on in one of the oldest philosophical debates. It simply takes its two characters, gives them two different viewpoints, and presents a few tired old ideas.\n\nThis is unfortunate, as the film's script hamstrings an otherwise wonderful production. Both actors are excellent (both formerly appearing in \"Northern Exposure\" together, they have an Emmy nomination and a Tony award between them). The music is lovely. The location is stunning and beautifully shot. That the film was shot digitally (the credits proclaim that no celluloid was harmed during the making of this film) but with the exception of one shot, you'd never be able to tell.\n\nIt just makes you wish the film were better. In particular, the film's aforementioned secret feels like a letdown when it finally comes out. It seems to impact only one living person, and the buildup to that point is so weak that the explosion is almost nil.\n\nIn the end, this film is just a little too much like the boat in which JT and Hollis are sitting. It looks good, but the motor isn't powerful enough to give it the kind of drive for which it's begging"}
{"text":"Before the Kollaps, Detective Josef Horkai was the best at resolving the seemingly worst scenarios with minimal collateral damage. When all else failed, he was like the great relief pitcher winning the game with striking out the opponents and hitting a walk off homerun. However that was pre-Kollaps Horkai.\n\nIn post Kollaps, Horkai awakens to white noise with amnesia except for recalling the end of the world Kollaps. He still has an inner sense that he is the best though at what remains vague and acknowledges civilization has radically changed. Horkai is aware that his life is slipping away while people linger nearby monitoring him in what appears to be a total frozen state. His legs no longer work and his hands seem on the verge of failure. He has no teeth or hair and has no idea how long he has been kept alive, why they keep him alive, or what is killing him.\n\nA stranger claiming to be his friend thaws Horkai. This person insists Horkai's skill as an investigator is desperately needed. Horkai's assignment is to retrieve a stolen cylinder before something as catastrophic as the Kollaps occurs; he realizes how vague this information is. With his head pounding, his limbs useless, and his focus off kilter and unable to delineate between memories and dreams, Horkai has little time if he wants to remain alive; he must finish the mission quickly so those he distrusts can return him to a frozen state.\n\nWith a dark Kafka like feel to the powerful 200 proof grim storyline, Immobility is a great thriller that grips the audience from the opening sequence when Horkai begins to slowly awaken to his environment. The background, whether it is the hospital room or outside slowly comes to life as a horrific dying world that will never see the sun shine again.\n\nThe harsh landscape sets the tone, but this is Horkai's tale. He struggles in this new world order where he lacks experiences as a paraplegic, which means his few memories of his days as a hero offer him little solace as he had functioning arms and legs then. His mission also disturbs him as he has mental issues with realism and once again his lack of experience in this environment. Even more troubling to Horkai is his gut instinct that his self-proclaimed friend and his caretakers are the enemy, keeping him on ice until they need him. Even the task is nebulous except for retrieving the cylinder.\n\nThis is a superb distressing noir thriller as the eclipse blocking the sun never moves on. With a super climax that, as a Monday morning quarterback, seems obvious but not while reading, fans will be spellbound by the darkness as Brian Evenson opens a curtain on a forbidding world. A hellhole where the beleaguered protagonist (and the audience) wonders if he suffers from an unending nightmare limiting his world or is this really happening to him; either way this is real in the mind of Horkai.\n\nOur Readers Respond\n\nFrom: Carole:\n\nMuch better cover than the oginiral. I mistook the original cover as a young adult novel and almost didn't purchase it. So was pretty pleasantly surprised by what was inside. It was a case of not judging a book by its cover. So this one is a bit more accurate reflecting what to expect. Look forward to seeing what's done for books 2 and 3."}
{"text":"Devil's DVD Advocacy: Inception\n\nChristopher Nolan follows up his blockbuster The Dark Knight with a film that goes back to his Memento or even The Prestige ways with a true puzzler of a film called Inception. Trying to tap those roots, Nolan tries to please the mind more than the eyes. Don't get me wrong there is plenty of action to be had, especially in the second half of the film.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio channels his character Teddy Daniels from last years Shutter Island for the most part here as Dom Cobb. Along with his right-hand man Arthur, Cobb navigates others dreams while they are asleep and secure information for clients. Bottom line, a way of corporate espionage.\n\nWhen a job goes wrong, Cobb finds himself in that movie mentality, one last job to get me home and I'm done. A common trait seen in many action movies that depict the hero agreeing to do a job that otherwise wouldn't do but will because of the promised outcome. Providing this opportunity is Ken Watanbe's Saito.\n\nEnough about plot, I want to talk about the acting and the film itself. DiCaprio did a fine job but as mentioned before, I felt it was a very similar character as Shutter Island's right down to the mysterious wife and two children involved. The characters were so alike it was eerie, and the fact it was back to back movies made me not appreciate the work that DiCaprio did here as I felt I should.\n\nLast time I stay at a hotel that's marked for demolition.\n\nEllen Page is also in this film but comes across as more of a narrator to the audience to explain things when we may not understand. To me, Nolan, while in Memento the audience has to connect the pieces, has characters such as Page's Adiadne sort of takes a time-out and explain things for us to understand. One such instance is why Cobb has the wife issues that manifest in the dreams and while in other scenes character's explain why it's possible to go further deeper into dreams with the sudden revelation of just using more sedation. I can go further into detail and explain this but I don't want to spoil details that one will see when viewing the film. I just feel that everything is wrapped up in neat little packages and all the dream sequences aren't perplexed as on would think.\n\nThe top performances that highlight the film to me were of Marion Cotillard as Cobb's Wife, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, and of Tom Hardy as Eames. Cotillard gives a great femme fatale, crossed with a psychiatric patient, mixed with the creepiness of Freddy Krueger. Gordon-Levitt does great with Arthur who keeps Cobb balanced. He also is in the most visually appealing scene in the hotel hallway. Hardy plays Eames the same as Arthur but with a more willingness to take risks and chances.\n\nInception is a movie that would be more appreciated in the theaters than at home for its visual effects. Even with its simplicity at times, it still is an enjoyable film and one of the summer's better ones. I give it 3 pitchforks, because I was entertained but wasn't wowed as I felt I was believed to be. That's my opinion\u2026.well my devil's advocate opinion at least.\n\nIn reality I really enjoyed the film, it was no masterpiece or no Memento by any means but was a real nice blend of action mixed into a mind provoking film. Despite underused actors such as Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy, the other main stream actors made up for that and more. With Nolan's vision of the dream world you can't but help second guess what's real or not leaving the theater. This is easily one of the summer's, scratch that, one of the year's best films."}
{"text":"Parents say\n\nKids say\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nParents need to know that this movie has brief strong and vulgar language, mild sexual references, a scary accident, and a sad on-screen death. Many characters are mourning sons killed in the war. One returning soldier is disabled and bitter. Pete responds to bad news by getting drunk and he drives while he is drunk.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nSet in the 1950s, THE MAJESTIC centers on Hollywood screenwriter Pete (Jim Carrey), whose feels like he's on the brink of success, with his first film about to arrive in theaters, a starlet girlfriend, and a great script accepted for production. But Pete's life turns upside down when his name comes up in the McCarthy-era investigations of suspected communists. Upset, he gets drunk, gets into an accident, and winds up with amnesia in an idyllic Norman Rockwellian community where everyone says he looks familiar. Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) thinks Pete is his son, Luke, a war hero reported missing in action. Harry seems so sure that Pete begins to believe it. The town has lost many young men in the war, and his return is cause for celebration. Harry is so excited he even pledges to reopen his movie theater, The Majestic. As Pete tries to figure out who he really is, he meets people from Luke's past, including his girl, Adele (Laurie Holden). Meanwhile, FBI agents, convinced that Pete's disappearance is evidence he's a Communist, set out to find him. Lack of a past allows Luke\/Pete to think about what his dream really is. Still the screenwriter, he \"fills in the blanks\" to understand the lives of the people in the town. But in rebuilding The Majestic and connecting to Harry and Adele he achieves a greater authenticity of feeling and spirit than he had before.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nFor the first time, in The Majestic, Jim Carrey opens himself up to draw from a more vulnerable part of himself as he plays a character who literally does not know who he is. It is not a great performance, but it is a moving one, within the context of the story and as an invitation to share some of Carrey's own journey to a broader maturity as a performer. The Majestic shares this double layer of meaning because it is as much about the movies and the role they play in our lives as it is about the characters and the story.\n\nHarry says that in a movie the good guy should always win, and this is a movie that Harry would love. It has enough of the guaranteed elements for warming the heart to please both the fictional studio executives in the movie and the real-life ones who got this made. And it presents these homespun values with enough sophistication (and a little bit of \"just-kidding\" ironic distance) to make it work. It plays with history and gets a little corny, but the movie itself has such a good time with it that the audience does Red Scare of the 1950's that blacklisted many Hollywood writers and performers. As recently as 1999, when distinguished director Elia Kazan received a special Oscar, there were protests because he cooperated with the House Committee, as Pete is urged to do here. Some of those called to testify refused to cooperate. What were the different pressures that Pete had to reconcile? What were the priorities that made him decide what he did? How did his ideas about himself change? Why"}
{"text":"Sunday, August 12, 2012\n\nOf late there seems to have been a rediscovery of Stanley Kubricks's Barry Lyndon. Several theaters in New York, including Lincoln Center have played the film. Many of the biggest film fans I know have come out to say how much they really like the film, with some going on about how happy they were happy that the best of Kubrick's films finally got a proper restoration on Bluray.\n\nIs the film that good? Is it the unheralded jewel in the Kubrick catalog? Is it a film that should be the source of high fives between film fans who discover a shared love of the film?(as it was with an acquaintance in a bar recently)\n\nProbably.\n\nFirst off the film isn't unloved or unliked. Too many people I know love the film for that. It is simply un-talked about, the question is why is that?\n\nI'm guessing is it's the least sexy of Kubrick's films.\n\nPaths of Glory has Kirk Douglas and is a stinging antiwar film.\n\nSpartacus is a huge Hollywood epic\n\nLolita has controversial subject matter and Peter Sellers\n\nStrangelove is Strangelove\n\n2001 is trippy\n\nClockwork Orange is funny, violent and controversial\n\nShining has Nicholson chewing scenery\n\nFull Metal Jacket is a big war film with great sequences and R Lee Ermy\n\nEyes Wide Shut is a mess, but it's his last film.\n\nBarry Lyndon doesn't fit into any of that line up.\n\nLyndon is a 18th century period drama based on a Thackeray novel with a lead actor, Ryan O'Neal, many people consider a joke. It's a film that seems to be the red headed step child of all of Kubrick's films. It's an epic film that somehow seems strangely warm and personable which Kubrick's films are only in fits and starts.\n\nWarm and personable?\u2026no it is. Really. Consider all of the other Kubrick films and you tell me where you see another film that doesn't feel like you're an observer in an almost sterile environment? Maybe, perhaps Spartacus, but even that suffers from the fact it's a huge film that you are distanced even in the close ups. Kubrick's films aren't so much movies as clinical studies masquerading as feature films. His films are people under the microscope, or in the case of Clockwork Orange one man's version of the truth, slightly less clinical than all the rest, but still a case study in a life.\n\nWhich thinking about it would seem to indicate that had Clockwork not been made we would never have gotten Barry Lyndon. Think about it, Clockwork is the least sterile, least Kubrickian of his films to that point. You have film that has dirt and grime and doesn't look completely perfect. You also have a voice over that rips control of the film from the director and puts it into the hand of Alex.\n\nWhat other film is like that? Only Barry Lyndon.\n\nActually Clockwork and Lyndon are probably the first Kubrick films with any real human characters (Spartacus excepted). Yes I know you have an odd character here and there, say Peter Sellers as Mandrake or Slim Pickens in Strangelove, but outside of that there aren't many real people. Kubrick seems more interested in using the characters as props (everyone in 2001) or mouthpieces (Kirk Douglas in Paths of Glory). Clockwork has Alex, who bends the characters in his telling to his own devices, and Lyndon has pretty much everyone behaving as if they can control their world. Sure much of what we know about the characters comes from the narration, but at the very least it fills in emotional details that we'd never get otherwise (or, more importantly, in any other Kubrick film)\n\nBarry Lyndon is the story of a rogue who is forced to flee when he kills a man in a duel. He ends up in the army, and after saving his commanding officer he begins climbing the social ladder until he marries a rich widow. It's not a happy film. Lyndon is a scoundrel and rogue, not of charming variety. Things go wrong and by the time we reach the end no one is particularly happy.\n\nAtypically to Kubrick's film this is his one film that doesn't seem to have a subtext. The film is the story of a rogue. It feels like it's source, a Thackeray novel come to life. It doesn't seem to be a film that is about anything beyond that. If you look at Strangelove you have a critic of the arms race, Paths of Glory and Full Metal are about the absurdity or war. 2001 is about everything or anything you can fit into it. Eyes Wide Shut is about lust and personal relationships. Clockwork is about society and it's outcasts. Lyndon seems to be just a ripping pot boiler. Of course it has a great deal going on, much like the source novel. Its a film that is deeper than many of his others with details across the entire three hours fueling the themes and subtexts. If you want to talk about the film in detail you have to really pull the whole film apart.\n\nI suspect that people don't talk about liking this film because it doesn't seem like you're liking one of the cool films. Its not a film where you can easily argue the deeper meaning of what's going on\u2026additionally as I said earlier it doesn't have humor, violence or trippy images that draw people to other Kubrick films.\n\nRelated to that I think people aren't talking about it because to like the film frequently means you get shouted down by a fan of one of the other films who never tires of repeating lines like \"Open the pod bay doors Hal\", \"Here's Johnny\", Or \"What kind of Malfunction are you?\" I've gotten shouted down by any number of people who love to state how clever they are by liking one of Kubrick's bigger films and stating and restating the obvious points about why those films \"rule\".\n\nLyndon is not a film for all audiences. Its slow, long and very much from another time. There are few duels, a battle scene or two, but mostly there is just people and talk. The music is several centuries out of date. Other than someone looking for a good film, regardless of the type, most modern audiences are not going to watch it. I mean Ryan O'Neal is the star, what's he best known for these days? Being Tatum's dad and Farrah Fawcett's boyfriend.\n\nWhy do people like this film? Because it's the most human sized of his films, even if it is a huge epic.\n\nI really like Barry Lyndon. It's probably tied with Clockwork for my favorite Kubrick film. Admittedly it's not a film I watch often. It is not a film for casual viewing, it's a three hour and four minute commitment. The joys of the film are in devouring the whole film, and not coming in 25 minutes in or popping in a favorite scene. And there are no favorite scenes or sequences, there is simply the whole film. You can't pull it apart. (another strike against it in many people's eyes). With every other Kubrick film you can discuss one scene or another (war room, Beyond Jupiter, The record store, Kidman's monologue), I dare you to try and discuss one scene or sequence in Barry Lyndon as a stand-alone dissection, you can't do it. Everything in this film ties to something else.\n\nIt's a masterpiece in the truest sense of the word since it's a film that requires you take in on in total or not at all. (another reason people don't want to discuss it, it's too big a thing to talk about fully)\n\nWhile I understand why people seem to shun Barry Lyndon, at the same time I'm tickled pink every time someone professes that they love the film. It's so nice to know that I'm not alone in the world and that there are people out there who really do like good movies and understand that sometimes you have to look beyond the flash in the pan.\n\n1 comment:\n\nI've recently been ordering the DVDs for Kubrick films through Netflix because I've made it my goal to see every one of them. I just watched the first part of Barry Lyndon today and was just struck by how different it is from the other ones I've seen (Eyes, Clockwork, 2001), but it is the most beautiful of all of them. You can literally feel the passion that Kubrick must have had while making it. It was a breath of fresh air for me and made me so glad I tried it. Oddly enough, I never heard of it before until I looked them all up. It is def interesting that nobody ever talks about it."}
{"text":"Wall\n\nI'm glad that Bradbury novels often include a dichotomy between the characters of lightness and darkness, tyranny and freedom etc, in the form of a brief vocal argument between the opposing philosophies. In Fahrenheit 451, it was the chief fireman vs. Guy Montag. In this film (I haven't read the book yet), there is Mr. Dark vs. the librarian, where Mr. Dark articulates his perspective on darkness.\n\nUnjustly maligned adaptation of Bradbury's classic may not completely capture the dark magic of the book, but still does a very good job of translating it to the screen. Some of the minor characters and subplots are underdeveloped, and the young actors playing the boys aren't the best, but they're backed up by a great cast of character actors and some impressive special effects. Definitely worth another look."}

{"text":"Related Films\n\nBoth Joe Carnahan's The Grey and Asger Leth's Man on a Ledge opened last week during the movie industry \"dead zone,\" a name film scholar David Bordwell gave to the first quarter of the calendar year. During this stretch, lower-profile releases with limited box-office expectations often sneak into theaters for brief runs alongside their Oscar-craving kinfolk. At their worst, these movies slip in and out of the multiplex without a peep. But at their best, these movies are more nervy and creative than most summer blockbusters and autumnal prestige pictures. After seeing Carnahan's and Leth's latest films this weekend, I was left with two questions: First, what made The Grey such a bracing example of this kind of neo-\"B\" film storytelling? Second, why was Man on a Ledge nothing more than a high-concept fiasco?\n\nLet's start with the actors. The Grey stars Liam Neeson as John Ottway, a tormented man who survives a plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness with seven other members of an oil-drilling team. Like Clint Eastwood, Neeson has defied time. He's gotten older, yet thanks to movies like 2008's Taken, he's also transformed himself into a bankable action hero. His two great traits are his bulk and his gentle demeanor: He's capable of assuming the alpha-male role among a pack of surly Hemingway types, but he's also capable of flavoring a line like \"You're gonna die; that's what's happening\" with something like paternal care. The Grey surrounds him with an able-bodied cast of middle-aged character actors like Dallas Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, and Frank Grillo, who give the film an air of solemnity and seriousness. These men aren't playing around.\n\nThe titular \"man on the ledge\" in Leth's film is Avatar's Sam Worthington, who shares Neeson's space-eating screen presence but lacks any corresponding moral force or psychological complexity. Worthington plays an ex-cop who's been wrongfully imprisoned, but for all his outrage and frustration, he feels like he's just playing with the role rather than inhabiting it. This is kind of remarkable: How can you make clinging to the side of a building seem phony? His capable co-stars \u2014 Elizabeth Banks, Anthony Mackie, Ed Harris, and Kyra Sedgwick \u2014 never fill the emotional void he creates. For a while, Banks is pleasingly matter-of-fact as she tries to talk him back inside. But the other performers seldom bring any elements of danger or volatility to their roles. They're paid professionals doing risk-free work.\n\nAnother key difference between the two films comes from the apparent simplicity of their plots. For example, The Grey focuses stubbornly and pitilessly on how Ottway and his fellow crash survivors are going to survive the wilderness. Carnahan spends the rest of the film whittling down his ideas about man and nature (and about God and faith) until they're as sharp and wounding as spear points. Instead of staying focused on its protagonist's tense situation, though, Man on a Ledge heads in the opposite direction. Leth and screenwriter Pablo F. Fenjves frantically broaden their canvas in an attempt to weave together the heist film, the cop drama, the social-protest picture, and the romantic-comedy caper. Eventually, all the reversals, revelations, complications, and expansions tug the movie in so many different directions that it's torn into little scraps.\n\nBut it's not like either movie is a model of realism. No matter how savage the wolves of The Grey are, their threat is not grounded in fact. Wolves simply don't kill people, much less methodically hunt them down like the members of a highly trained lupine assassins' guild. However, if you think of these outsized predators as symbols of the natural world's savagery or what Jack London once memorably described as \"the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life,\" then the film gains strength as a nasty parable about the fragility of human existence. After a while, Carnahan doesn't even need wolves to get his point across. He just lets them howl in the darkness. And when day breaks, he watches his ever-dwindling band of survivors trudge through the ankle-deep snow of Alaska's windy, treacherous vastness.\n\nThere's no way to read the ridiculous plot twists and shabby action set pieces of Man on a Ledge as anything other than the desperate flailings of a filmmaker trying to mix-and-match genre conventions. More ridiculous and offensive than these scattershot chase scenes and plot twists are the statements about class envy shoehorned into the film. When the long-haired Occupy Wall Streeter who joins the crowd of passersby and takes an interest in the drama between Banks and Worthington unfolding 21 stories above him spouts some prefab nonsense about the rich getting away scot-free while the poor suffer, it's a gesture, not an emotion. This guy's shouts of \"Attica!\" aren't rallying cries for a wrongfully accused man; they're a smart-ass allusion to Dog Day Afternoon, a far more volatile account of a big-city standoff.\n\nThe most important difference between The Grey and Man on a Ledge comes from the ways in which each film plays with genre expectations. Starting with a truly horrifying plane-crash sequence, The Grey begins with blood and violence but ultimately slows down, growing more pensive, contemplative, and potent as its characters come face to face with their tragic destiny. Man on a Ledge, however, grows more breakneck and goofy until it plummets off its perch and lands in the safety net made from dozens of action-film clich\u00e9s."}

What are they asking us to consider? The means that one should follow to track down one man? The amount we'll alter our own ideals to get a job done?\n\nOne of my favorite scenes in the film is when Maya and her fellow officer Jessica talk about what motivates operatives to resort to the measures that they eventually have to. Money? They dismiss that immediately. Ideology? The same basic concept of money. This movie isn't about politics. It's about a group of people in a room realizing that there the only ones left who are responsible for solving the situation. There's no on another floor, just them.

Lets not get into the Oscar-fodder fray if we don't recognize phrases like \"for your consideration.\"\n\njkredwine\n\nI thought The Hurt Locker was absolutely terrible, almost exclusively because of Mark Boal's absurd and over-the-top screenplay full of cliche.\n\nThe writing for Zero Dark Thirty isn't much better, but the acting is certainly superior. Jessica Chastain is fantastic. For the record, though, you said another filmmaker might add \"the cushion of a human story amidst the strenuous ten-year project to hunt down the infamous al-Qaeda leader\" to make the story more palatable\u2013 Jessica Chastain's characters is exactly that. She allows the film to emotionally center around a precisely (and fictionally) crafted lead rather than struggle to maintain a narrative around the broad ensemble of actors who worked to bring Bin Laden down. It works, but it's certainly the easier route.\n\nIf Bigelow wins ANOTHER Oscar for this film I'm going to have to finally live up to my threats to stop watching the Academy Awards altogether.

{"text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUser Reviews\n\nThis is one of the best whodunit's in years! The acting is great, and cleverly staged. Each individual adds more and more complexity to the storyline such that you can't discount whether or not they're crucial to the plot. The plot unweaves slowly, but evenly, adding layer on layer of innuendo, suggestion, twists, and turns that catch you off guard. No one character, or actor for that matter, overtakes any of the others. I don't think you'll get this consistency, unless Mamet directs. The downtown realism of Buenos Aires only adds to the story. It's not a shoot location we're used to seeing, and the novel setting creates an odd contrast to what we've seen come out of modern Europe. The action is well-paced, with a steady guessing, and wondering-what's-gonna-happen-next pace. I highly recommend seeing this movie before, and if, a US version is released.\n\n32 of 35 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?"}
{"text":"form the unlikeliest of alliances and begin to remake their lives.\n\nJacques Audiard's \"Rust and Bone\" is an effective and moving drama about the strength of the human spirit and the will to survive. Given that Audiard has previously made macho, tightly directed movies (such as his Oscar-nominated 2009 prison drama \"A Prophet\"), it's no surprise this is a testament to tough love.\n\nAs her character begins to overcome a seemingly insurmountable injury, the power of Cotillard's performance distracts us from Stephanie's disfigurement and draws us deep into her experience. She begins as a woman whose view of life had never extended much past her own vanity and daily routine. After the depression of her near-death begins to lift, she begins to perceive the world differently, seeing possibilities and life all around her. She begins living more fully with a wheelchair and prosthetic legs than she ever had before.\n\nThe key to her rebirth is Ali, a petty crook, inattentive single father and aspiring bare-knuckle street fighter. He's played by the bull-necked Belgian star Matthias Schoenaerts as a boxer drawn to his sport not because it appeals to a violent streak but because it provides an outlet for his sheer brute energy.\n\nHe's completely matter-of-fact about life's hard knocks, which is why Stephanie's intuition led her to call him. On their first outing to the beach he leaves her on the beach and plunges into the water. It's not a callous gesture but a challenge. She can get back into the swim if she wants it enough. He's not a sensitive lover \u2013 he asks if she's in the mood as casually as you'd schedule an oil change \u2013 but he's a 110-volt connection to the life force.\n\nAs Stephanie becomes Ali's manager, promoter and cheerleader, she rebuilds an unimaginable new career from the wreckage of her old life. They fight for every step forward and you cheer them on. The film's odd title refers to the taste of a solid punch to the jaw. It's also a hint that sometimes it takes a painful blow to remind you you're alive"}
{"text":"Blu-ray Review: The Dark Knight\n\nIt's hard to fathom a movie with more hype behind it than The Dark Knight. This is the point where the comic book movie has truly come into its own, surpassing the usual boundaries to become something more. It's impossible to give full credit to anyone here, although names can certainly be tossed out as to who made this more special than it would have been without them. It's not a perfect film by any stretch, but it's a great thrill ride.\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan eschews the usual build-up, creating a villain entrance that's both eerie, impressively scaled, and almost completely illogical (no one saw a bus crash through a bank while walking on the streets?). It's the only thing the audience needs to become involved with the Joker, played by Heath Ledger in his much hyped final performance. There's no need for a backstory to explain where he came from or why he does what he does. It's all there in the performance, and it's certainly one that's notable.\n\nThat opening is a perfect set piece to what becomes a sometimes overlong investigation. The mystery here is deep, at times slightly confusing, and always intense. The personal side to this conflict gripping Gotham City is portrayed through sheer mass panic to gain a sense of scale and one-on-one confrontations where the actors can shine. Likewise, action a-plenty delivers what audiences came to see, including an unforgettable tunnel chase, and multiple fights that offer incredible impact.\n\nKatie Holmes is gone as Rachael Dawes, strangely choosing to star in the comedy Mad Money instead of this sequel. In her place is Maggie Gyllenhaal who offers up a stronger performance than Holmes. It's evident as she faces off with Ledger at a fundraiser, where the emotion of the moment lets her shine.\n\nUnderrated is Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face. While Ledger steals the show, Eckhart is forced to play under him, and it's a shame. Part of that is the scripting, which overwhelms audiences with the Joker, making Two-Face feel unnecessary at times. It's crowded, and it shouldn't be. That said, the special effects used to create this secondary villain are amazing, and absolutely rock-solid. Never does the effect come off cheesy or even slightly unrealistic. It's as impressive as it is gruesome.\n\nIt's hard to find fault in a movie that does nearly everything right, although claiming this to be a cinematic masterpiece is probably going a bit far. It's undoubtedly the best of the Batman films, and that's including any era. It's probably the best of the comic book movies as well, transcending the usual colorful stylings and one-liners (though Dark Knight does slip a few in there) for a serious, involved tone. Dark Knight is too long, loaded with too many characters, and not always as smart as it thinks it is, but it is enormously entertaining."}
{"text":"Hiroshima mon Amour\n\nShame you don't like Marienbad. It really didn't 'get me' until the moment where it repeatedly trucks in to the woman at ever increasing speeds while her figure goes from embracing to horrified and the male voiceover shouts, \"NO! I DIDN'T! I'M NOT CAPABLE OF THAT!\" and I realize that one of the (many) narratives underlining the production is that this may be a meeting between a victim and her rapist, where she blocked the memory out and he's trying to revise it to justify himself.\n\nI got that part, I got the whole idea that the viewer is left to decide what kind of relationship these people had. I ultimately did not like it because to me, the concept was taken so far that these people were reduced to being ideas instead of people. I guess that was the point with \"A\" and \"B\" and \"K\" and whatever but to me, it's like I'm watching placeholders for humans and scenarios instead of experiences. It just left me way too cold and in a place much too intellectual for my liking.\n\nI wanted to like it, I truly truly tried to like it since I love Hiroshima, but I just had to be honest about it in the end. I did like that one spooky guy (the husband) who plays the take away game and always wins. God what a creep that man was.\n\nI didn't say that's what the movie was about, but that it's one of the things it is about. Or as Pastuch sez,\n\n\"the viewer is left to decide what kind of relationship these people had.\"\n\nAnd in response to the next line,\n\n\"I ultimately did not like it because to me, the concept was taken so far that these people were reduced to being ideas instead of people.\"\n\nThere is ultimately a lot more humanity in it than just a 'game of the mind' piece. Underlying the movie regardless of your individual reading of specific narrative details is a massive post-war anxiety, the same anxiety that underlines Hiroshima Mon Amour. This is the era where pretty much everything Resnais is making is mindful of the atomic bomb and the Holocaust. That makes it more than just an intellectual exercise, but a confrontation of the rules (including narrative rules) of a world where people feel fit to justify killing in such great numbers, and sometimes use narratives (propaganda, et al) to enable that justification.\n\nIt's a very 'mature' movie in the sense that it's building off of visual practices started by such movements as the Surrealists and the Dadaists, themselves reactionary filmmakers of the post-WWI era. It's a lot more structural and a lot more sober, though I don't want to claim its entirely without a sense of humor.\n\nAnd even without the historical anxiety element I'm describing, it does push forward the trend toward abstraction enabled in the visual arts by the construction of photography and motion pictures in the first place, so there's that. That area is where I will agree that this can be seen as coldly intellectual. But I'm down with abstraction, personally, so\u2026\n\nI liked your comments on Hiroshima. It makes me want to see it again, especially since I didn't really \"get\" the film. Ironically, your criticisms against Marienbad are sort of my criticisms against Hiroshima. The characters don't seem like real people, and your recent comments suggest that they represent certain ideas and themes (which I didn't notice, nor would I have be able to view the film that way when I saw it).\n\nMy sense is that French films around this period often used characters in this abstract, cypher-ish way.\n\nIn fact in some sense seeing what I've seen of Alain Robbe-Grillet's subsequent work, his ideas are more procedurally abstract and mind-game in style, Alain Resnais' is the more primal cry of horror stuff. They both did a little bit of both though. The result of this collaboration is unlike anything else, which is both remarkable and unfortunate because I'd really like to see other movies 'like' Marienbad but Marienbad is unique.\n\nJazzaloha, I also saw the people in Hiroshima as sort of ciphers during my last viewing. I was thinking \"This is just melodramatic tripe, why did I like this?\".\n\nBut then, I somehow have been ignoring that great scene with the woman when she washes her hair in the sink: she just about says as much. And another clue is when she completely loses herself in the tea room and the man has to smack her back to reality. There is some very great sound design here and in fact in the entire film: I had never quite noticed the excellent placement of train sounds throughout the entire background of the film. Cars, musical horns, footsteps, running water- the sound is excellent.\n\nSo yeah, while I always saw the film as two people kind of trapped within the memories of their past, I never quite saw it as them almost totally isolated from their real world surroundings. The scene where she nearly gets lost in the peace parade, the restaurant scene, the scene with them walking along a deserted street (framed so it looks like the man is haunting her).\n\nHere are two people so helplessly, melodramatically trapped inside the concept of this woman (the woman herself and the man are both trying to \"relieve\" this abstract memory) as well as within the concept of the Hiroshima bombings- that's what the beginning is all about.\n\nResnais and Duras take the idea of a \"mass memory\" of a big event in history and move to the small, human side of it and it basically becomes very bizarre. I never quite got the tone of the latter parts of the film, and now I kind of do.\n\n@Polaris- what you say about Resnais and \"primal cry of horror\" also applies to this. Because if all of the melodrama and screaming and flipping out in Hiroshima had taken place in say, a Bergman film, it would not seem so out of place and actually quite natural. I think that's what makes the film feel so weird, it starts off with two seemingly reasonable people musing about Hiroshima and its consequences and then they start actually living the memories of their youth to the point where they're both hysterical.\n\n\"it starts off with two seemingly reasonable people musing about Hiroshima and its consequences and then they start actually living the memories of their youth to the point where they're both hysterical.\"\n\nOne of Resnais' themes was: to move forward, we must 'forget' the past and yet, the past must remain, as part of who we are. It is a theme that allows the film to have a universality, which keeps it fresh and undated. (The theme is also found in Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz.) Memory, collective of individuality, effects everyone's ability to take and idea into the world \u2013 that theme effects everyone.\nThat existential theme would certainly be something Duras struggled with in her artistic and personal life.\n\nThe film only just missed the critics' top 10 in the 1962 Sight & Sound poll, having made a huge splash at the time, as did Breathless and L'Avventura. Now it is not even in the top 100. How are we to account for this decline? Is it suspicion of elegance, beauty, intellect?\n\nLater Resnais films have not been such landmarks and probably of mixed quality, but i think films should be judged on merit, not devalued by later standards or overall auteurist ranking. For instance i love some early Wenders as much as ever, despite later failures. Certain styles also come and go with fashion. I'm happy for Rivette to get attention, though- and i prefer him to Resnais too.\n\nBut also, some of what I said about post-war anxiety and atomic age stuff is necessary too, because society isn't really feeling as existentially threatened by nuclear threat as it was just after the two bombs went off. That's opening up a whole other can of worms over whether or not society 'should' be feeling as threatened (it's always a danger, really), but nevertheless the whole concept itself may not be as engaging to modern audiences.\n\nSadly but as Robert Peabody points out, maybe that's the point?\n\nHow 'bout it guys, thread about a list of movies that are purposefully designed to be forgotten?\n\nJohn said, Here are two people so helplessly, melodramatically trapped inside the concept of this woman\u2026\n\nBut they seemed more like artificial constructs\u2014ciphers, as we mentioned. So the poignancy or melodrama just didn't work for me. But I was used to this style of filmmaking when I first saw the film, so maybe if I see it again, I will change my opinion.\n\nKenji said, \"How are we to account for this decline? Is it suspicion of elegance, beauty, intellect?\"\n\nJust a thought\u2014relating to my comment above: maybe the approach to the characters hasn't aged well?\n\nHow 'bout it guys, thread about a list of movies that are purposefully designed to be forgotten?\n\nSounds intriguing, but no films come to mind immediately. I'm thinking of Hollywood fluff\u2014but I don't think they're intentionally designed to be forgotten\u2014just not designed to be remembered, perhaps.\n\nBut they seemed more like artificial constructs\u2014ciphers, as we mentioned. So the poignancy or melodrama just didn't work for me. But I was used to this style of filmmaking when I first saw the film, so maybe if I see it again, I will change my opinion.\n\nThey didn't seem like ciphers to me because they aren't necessarily melodramatic from the start, and even then they go through a wide range of emotions, especially the man. When they're chatting in bed in the beginning or in the man's empty house, they were acting fairly calm and natural. And again, the scene towards the end in the Casablanca bar, where they stare at each other seems to hint that they realize how trapped they are in each other. The man also goes from being overjoyed with her to hating her over and over again.\n\nI mean, at the end of the film, they basically admit they've become ciphers, ideas. They basically no longer exist as actual humans, but a collection of ideas and cliches for someone else. But it's not as literal as in Marienbad: here in Hiroshima they're two humans that realize what they've become, and they react to it. It's hard to catch on the first few viewings, as it was for me, because there is this big romantic love story at the forefront.\n\nBut for me, at the end, both characters realized it makes no difference whether or not she stays. They will never see each other more than placeholders, ciphers for their own memories. Memory vampires. Ridiculous people. They realize how ridiculous they are.\n\nThe creepy part about it is the last couple of lines and the way they're delivered. She seems a bit astonished and horrified by this fact. Yet the way the man delivers it, he seems pretty much OK with it. Like Scotty in Vertigo \"Yes, you will be Nevers in France. So what's the problem?\" Again, his expression of emotions is what keeps the two characters from just being ciphers completely. He's so relentless through the whole movie, he becomes SO happy when he realizes she has told her big secret ONLY to him.\n\nI don't know about the approach to the characters not ageing well. Maybe the strange formality, if not (Brechtian distancing) absurdity, of their spoken interactions may make them feel like ciphers for intellectual ideas. But questioning reality and subjectivity, along with themes of time, memory (collective and personal), nuclear power, war, love, patriotism, cultural interaction, fate, individuals caught up in and responding to major events, seem relevant and important as ever. And the pain of Emmanuelle Riva- the Nevers passages are tremendous- comes through very strongly. When visiting the Loire or seeing it in Straub-Huillet's excellent L'Itin\u00e9raire de Jean Bricard recently, i was bound to remember her and Sacha Vierny's beautiful cinematography."}
{"text":"Untitled\n\nBrilliant nostalgia piece from Federico Fellini, arguably the best film of his formative, post neo-realist years, about five man-child layabouts in a small country town who sponge off family, dodge responsibility, and revel in the joys of booze, women, and male friendship. When the most dashing of the group, Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), is forced to marry a girl he knocked up, and get a job at a local merchant shop, the remaining pack envy his seemingly adult choices, until he hits on the boss's wife, steals a priceless statue from the inventory, and nearly destroys all the earned good will of the marriage. Fellini's autobiographical examination of friendship, responsibility, and growing up is filled with joyous moments tinged with nostalgic yearnings and disappointments, like when the group intellectual (Leopoldo Trieste) dismays at the wasted opportunity of selling a play to a boozy fey actor from Rome, or when a rambling, drunken Alberto Sordi longs for his beloved sister, who has run away with a two-timing boyfriend; it's a dreamy landscape of parties and loafing, perpetuated with deeply felt emotions of regret and loss, but not without a positive understanding for the hopes of future prosperity."}

The fact that this was based on a true story made it especially interesting. On one level, this was just an entertaining story. On a deeper level, it exposes what can happen to ordinary people and their families when they are caught up in unexpected success and attention. it is also the story of how much we can achieve if we step outside our normal social constraints and go for what we believe in.\n\nComedy as light and fluffy as a sponge cake, (but basically a serious, true story), as served up by a very masterful chef. Helen Mirren and Julie Walters (AND the rest of the women) are in top, or topless if you will, form, and the English countryside is soooo beautifully photographed !\n\nA story of love, devotion, persistence, success, and being willing to step outside the bounds to make something good happen. Great humour and wit. Some terrific acting (primarily from Helen Mirren), and some great tension as the project (and success) builds. Good examination of the price paid by the families, as well as the main participants. Very moving, the more so because of being based on a real event.\n\nSummary\n\nWhen Chris' best friend Annie loses her husband, Chris derives a scheme to memorialize him. The two women, along with some of their friends - all fiftysomething women - will make a nude calendar to raise money for the hospital where he died. The calendar becomes hugely popular. Based on actual events.\nHelen Mirren, Julie Walters, John Alderton, Linda Bassett, Annette Crosbie, Ciaran Hinds, Celia Imrie."}
{"text":"\"Supreme art is a traditional statement of certain heroic and religious truth, passed on from age to age, modified by individual genius, but never abandoned.\" Yeats\n\nThursday, May 10, 2012\n\nThe House Of Islam: The Raid Redemption\n\nIt's difficult to say at exactly what point you realize you're watching a masterpiece during The Raid: Redemption, because there just hasn't been a film like it: it's not just the incredible fight scenes, but the unusual violence and the fear of this kind of situation the film sets-up being real, and you being trapped within it. Then, at some point, you realize, \"It is real, and I am trapped in it.\"\n\nThe apartment building that has been \"off limits\" to the law of Jakarta because of the absolute sway the crime lord holds over it. At the end of the film, the apartment hasn't been won, but it's crumbling and the crime lord is dead, so it won't take much for a group to go in and, as Andi says, take it down brick by brick, which is the intention.\n\nThis is the story of Rama, a rookie elite cop in Jakarta, Indonesia, getting ready to go into work, to make the raid. The first image is of a watch, ticking, then we see Rama on his prayer rug, reciting the Muslim prayers, Rama does a grueling physical work out and says to an old man, \"I'll bring him back.\" Great film makers know the first images are always the most important because they form and shape the audience's expectations; it's also a way of giving the audience information.\n\nRama during his morning workout. It's imperative for us to understand that his prayers and spiritual strength are every bit as important to the upcoming battle as his physical strength, even more so, because at one point, his physical strength is about to give out, but remembering his wife and baby strengthens his heart and soul so he can go on.\n\nIn Indonesia, Muslims are a majority of the population, Christians being greatly outnumbered, and Muslims are advancing in taking over the country. It's significant, then, that the first image of the main character is in the religious majority. The watch we first hear and see in the opening, however, is a symbol of history (as well as the old man Rama speaks to) and no one keeps better track of their history than the Muslims. So we all ready know that this story will be about Muslims on a larger scale and what is that? Restoring the House Of Islam to Muslim rule through a political jihad.\n\nI am a convert to Roman Catholicism and this makes a difference in my viewing of the film; I would like to say again that this film is really a masterpiece, it's just incredible how good it is, and I agree, wholeheartedly, with all the praise it has received from various awards committees because it deserves every bit. (Many people simply hate anything that has to do with religion, whether it's Christianity or not, and will adamantly protest my incorporation of a religious interpretation of the film simply because of their dislike; please note, however, the title of the film, The Raid: Redemption, \"redemption\" is a religious term and that invites a religious understanding of the events as well, again, as Rama on his prayer rug).\n\nAs the cops are entering the apartment building, they see a man who lives there trying to get in; they stop him and the captain doesn't want to let him go into the building, but the man insists that his wife is sick and he has to get her medicine. Rama protects the man so he can get back to her, then later, Rama brings one of his wounded friends to the apartment where the man and his sick wife live and beg shelter of them. Reluctantly, they agree, Rama's friend cursing Rama that the couple will turn them over to the crime lord and Rama insisting, \"He's not one of them.\" It's an interesting situation because, if following this line of analysis, the man can be taken as a Christian, his sick wife would be the Church (probably ill because of the sins of her members, myself included). The man hides Rama and his friend in a false wall, symbolically translated could be, from a Islamic perspective, a reservoir of sympathy towards Islam (for Christians, it would be more like we do good unto others because of the Good Christ did for us, and because what we do for another, we do for Christ, but this is why it's an interesting film, these kinds of \"discrepancies\"). In hiding, one of the crime lord's thugs sticks his sword into the wall where Rama's face is, running the blade into his cheek. This becomes an interesting situation to interpret because Rama, it appears has \"lost face\" or been \"defaced\" by accepting the help of a non-Muslim, whereas the non-Muslim are rewarded with their lives because they helped the Muslims in need..?\n\nHaving aired my biases publicly, it's really a simple, but effective, plot: the apartment house symbolizes Indonesia itself, being run by a \"democratic constitution\" that should be run by Muslims (territory controlled by Islam is considered \"the house of Islam\"); the 20 elite cops symbolize the Muslim effort in Indonesia to take control. That Christians are the \"ruthless outlaws\" because anyone outside the law of Islam (Sharia Law) is an outlaw. So the purpose of the film is to get control over the House of Islam (the apartment building) and establish law and order (Sharia Law and Islam).\n\nTama, the crime lord holding full reign over the 30 stories of apartment the elite--but rookie--cop team enters to try and wipe him out. The problem is, he knew they were coming. There are at least two levels of corruption in the film, the type of personal corruption exhibited by Andi, Rama's brother (more on that below) and the professional corruption seen in the cops being bought and paid to leave the apartment and Tama alone. In this sense, going with the religious interpretation, the film can be seen as a critique of Muslim leaders who deal with Christian leaders instead of fulfilling the requirements of Islam (Rama, who is pure and who has a wife with child, symbolizes the unadulterated future of Islam in Indonesia once all the corruption is wiped out). Young Muslims might be tempted to criticize an old practice of Islam, that is, non-Muslims being allowed to worship in their own religion with the paying of a fine for not converting to Islam; devotees of Islam might be wanting that to be eradicated so there is a stricter policy of conversion for the non-Muslim population; why? In The Raid: Redemption there is a nearly intolerable level of corruption, and that would be inexcusable in Islam, hence, a potential movement to end the option of fining non-Muslims. The barbarity of Tama reflects the way Muslims view the history of Islamic-Christian relations (especially colored by The Crusades).\n\nWhat I most appreciate about the film is the way physical violence is translated into spiritual warfare, the battles we see, individually and collectively, are really the clashes of the spiritual world and not physical fights; materialists--specifically atheists--will denounce this viewpoint, however, I hold that nearly all violence in art can be traced back to inner-turmoil being expressed, either spiritually, politically or emotionally, and doesn't exist for the sake of violence, rather, violence is always about making a statement on where violence comes from within the culture. The Raid: Redemption carefully constructs scene after scene of gruelling violence that you think just can't get any worse,... until it does. Here is one small scene of the film:\n\nAn interesting detail regarding the apartment is that Tama, the crime lord, promises to give free rent and permanent residency to anyone killing the cops, most of the residents being criminals themselves. In Christianity, this makes sense, because all Christians know they are sinners (criminals, basically, against God's commandments and laws) and Tama's invitation to his residents is rather comparable to the promise made to suicide-bombers that they will go to heaven for witnessing for Allah. (Christians aren't rewarded for taking life, but for giving their life for Christ, and this is a slight, but definite disagreement between the two religions on the shared, but differently understood, concept of martyrdom).\n\nAndi (Rama's brother) on the left with a similar wound on his face and \"Mad Dog\" on the right who is small, but an incredible fighter and really, really mean.\n\nThere are two more characters needing to be discussed: Andi and Mad Dog. Tama, the crime lord, has two right hands, Andi the brains and Mad Dog the enforcer. Andi happens to be Rama's brother and, seeing his estranged brother in the apartment's security cameras, goes to save him. When Andi goes down into the elevator to the floor upon which he expects to find Rama, on the elevator wall is written in large, graffitied letters, \"GAUL.\" In what today is largely France, old Gaul was a region which was Christianized (and could be an encoded reference to \"the West\"and the medieval conflicts between Islam and Christianity from deep within history). Andi's \"being away from his family\" means that he converted over to Christianity (a real crime in Islam) and Andi refuses to return with Rama even when Rama tells his brother that he's \"going to be an uncle\" which is a prophecy: children symbolize the future, the next generation, and Rama tells Andi that the future is Islam, not Christianity in Jakarta, and Andi needs to make his decision.\n\nJaka, the police squad leader, and Mad Dog. Mad Dog could easily pull the trigger and kill Jaka, however, he tells Jaka that the hand-to-hand combat is where his rush comes from and insists on fighting Jaka to the death; poor Jaka doesn't stand a chance. Like a dog, Mad Dog drags Jaka's dead body back to Tama to show his boss what he has done for him, whereas Andi will come back empty-handed.\n\nAndi returns to Tama after his brief conversation with his brother and Tama is furious that Andi has returned \"empty-handed,\" so Tama takes a knife and stabs it through Andi's hand (an act familiar to Christians because Christ was stabbed through the hand with the nails). Tama then gives Andi to Mad Dog and Mad Dog works at beating Andi up, slowly killing him.\n\nAndi, Rama's brother and Tama's right-hand.\n\nSo who is Mad Dog?\n\"Mad dog\" in Catholicism probably refers to the Dominicans which is formed of two Latin words for \"dogs of God,\" who were created to tackle heresies both inside and outside of Christianity. Writings by various Dominicans have... upset Muslims over the centuries and the Church's continual dependence on their learning and sanctity has made them a bane to those who attack the Church. When Mad Dog has Jaka at gun point, and it would be easier to pull the trigger and kill him, but Mad Dog wants to fight him instead, that clearly references the Dominican love of Scholasticism and the \"argument for the sake of the argument\" which they are so famous for, even to this day.\n\nTama and the sergeant of the police force, Wahyu, who is there (risking the lives of all the rookie cops) because he wants a big payoff from Tama who refuses to give it to him. Tama was alerted that Wahyu would be coming by his superiors who wanted to get rid of him. This is the kind of \"corruption\" which devout Muslims may be critiquing in the film, that Islam is being used as a vehicle for personal gain, rather than spiritual redemption.\n\nWhen Rama walks into the meat locker and sees Mad Dog beating on his brother, he silently challenges Mad Dog to a fight, to fight both Rama and Andi at the same time. It's perhaps the most intense fight sequence I have ever seen, but one of the injuries which Mad Dog sustains in the battle is a fluorescent light bulb is rammed into his neck. Because the neck symbolizes what guides us, or that to which we are yoked (the way an ox is yoked to the plow, for example) it shows Mad Dog is yoked to \"illumination\" because the light bulb, being a source of light, symbolizes Light, i.e, truth and inner-illumination; hence, Mad Dog's (Dominicans') desire for illumination is really his death because the light bulb is broken, they seek illumination from the Broken Body of Jesus, instead of the teachings of Islam. Throughout the film, a person's physical strength and fighting capability communicates to the audience the character's deeper, spiritual level, so then it's all reconciled. That injury, the light bulb in the neck, is at least something I have never seen before, and the uniqueness of the inflicted injury speaks volumes to those willing to listen.\n\nMad Dog taking someone down.\n\nBack in February, I posted a trailer for an internationally acclaimed documentary called Position Among the Stars which follows an elderly Christian woman in Indonesia where Muslims are gaining power and wanting more:\n\nWhich ever side we are on in the battle, we are all involved, and no one can excuse themselves. Again, The Raid: Redemption is an absolutely fantastic film, incredibly well done and I suggest you watch it regardless of your religious beliefs (or lack of). I've advocated many times in the past the use of violence in art as a means of conveying deeper, internal struggles, and The Raid: Redemption certainly does that and then brings the inner-struggles back into the public, political arena for the whole world to watch and we should be watching. The extended clip below contains four different fight scenes:\n\nDear Anonymous, I truly understand your comment; I TRULY do, but it's also an act of censorship to automatically assume that someone saying something, anything, about a group of people based upon their religious identities or race, etc., is automatically prejudiced or bigoted, etc.; I don't know if you bothered to read the entire post, but I am a devout Christian and take no offense at being compared to the \"criminals\" and \"low-lifes\" and \"thugs\" the film presents Christians as being; it is an excellent film, extremely well-made, and to ignore the art and message a group is making is to be walling one's self up in ignorance. PLEASE, you are more than welcome to introduce a counter-reading of the film, and I would be most interested in reading it. I would like to point out two important points, however. First, it is THE VERY FIRST INFORMATION WE ARE GIVEN OF THE MAIN CHARACTER with whom we are asked to identify and root for; secondly, my interpretation not only accurately reflects the genuine political situation occurring within the Philippines, but goal and aim of Islam. If you ignore that, you are ignoring what Islam is and that, despite what some people will tell you, does not make you a better person than myself, it makes you someone who ignores things. Thank you for taking the time to leave your comments, and, again, I sincerely look forward to reading your own interpretation of this extremely well-done film!\n\nyou are thinking too much i guess,its story is very standard for hollywood action movies,if its american movie,make sure to watch the hollywood remake of this movie,i can guarantee the main character will pray to jesus. you said the thugs are christians and all,i hope you noticed the main villain while shooting his men was wearing sarong in the beginning of the movie,most men in indonesia will wear it when they are going to pray in the mosque.i never know anyone in indonesia would wear it into the church.so i guess the story isnt about religion AT ALL...no sign of christianity involved there.you also have to notice that religion in indonesia is not only islam and christian.\n\nand if you are talking the history why islam 'taking over indonesia' ...its a veryy loong history,and the incident the dutch invasion for 3.5 centuries for their gold glory gospel mission has a very big part,probably it was their fault why indoseian choose islam instead of christian.but i do respect a lot of indonesian christian heroes though.yep,im indonesian,and i know my history better than you.\n\nif you can interpreting a very simple plot movie into something like that,then i can interpret michael bay's transformer as crusade war,with megatron as the catholic general or something (didnt you see the cross on megatron's head?) and the innocent people are the infidel atheist sinner, or jews(isnt witwicky a jewish name?),you wanted to 'save' from hell.but thanks god,the good guys win,even if they are not christian.\n\nIf the film is re-made in Hollywood, no, the main character would not be praying to Jesus because that would be too religious for Hollywood, it wouldn't happen. It would, rather, be turned into a class warfare film, like the Gangster Squad film about to be released (Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin), but no, it would not be religious. You mentioned that you are from the Philippines.... why didn't you bother to say which religious denomination--if any--you are from? Further, I don't talk about history in the post except for briefly mentioning that watches are symbolic of time\/history. The Philippines have chosen to be Muslim; where do I get upset about that? I don't. It is, in fact, true, that in Islam--the dominant religion of the country--it is a crime to be anything other than Muslim, would you like to argue that? It's also a crime not to be a devout Muslim, would you like to argue that? There doesn't have to be any Christina religious symbols for a Muslim audience the film might want to reach, to understand who the \"criminals\" are, that's the way \"coding\" in all art forms work, there is just enough to suggest in art, because if it blatantly states something, it ceases to be art and then becomes a documentary or a political platform, but all art is encoded and there are enough structural elements throughout the film to legitimately base my thesis upon. You mention Transformers, I have not seen it, but that interpretation is very possible. It's not about who is a good guy or who is a bad guy, it's about the moral and value structure which causes an audience to be ABLE to identify the good guy from the bad guy. If you don't want to believe that, it's fine, but that's how art has operated for thousands of years, and will continue to operate until the end of humanity; you are not arguing with me, my friend, you are arguing with the very nature of what art is. Just because of my interpretation, doesn't mean that other interpretations of the film aren't possible; but just because other interpretations of the film are possible, doesn't invalidate mine. Thank you very much for taking the time to leave your comments and helping me to clarify these points of interest!\n\nYour theory collapses right at the start when you talk about the significance of the word \"Redemption\" in the title - the film's actual name is simply \"The Raid\" and the subtitle was added only because the production company couldn't secure the rights to the name.\n\nI believe everyone is entitled to their opinion and the mark of a great film is one where viewers can attach some form of personal sentiment or interpretation on, but fixing religious propaganda to it is significantly disrespectful to those who created the film. Why can't you just accept that the protagonist is Muslim and leave it at that?\n\nDear Outrack, First, please excuse the time lag between the time you posted your comment and my tardy response, I regret I don't have much time nowadays. Secondly, you have brought up a very interesting point, but, regrettably, it only feeds my argument, not yours. If the original title was \"The Raid\" only, and a change had to be made to the title, that--OF ALL THE WORDS IN THE WORLD THEY COULD HAVE CHOSEN BUT DIDN'T--they choose to add the word \"Redemption\" to the title, validates that a religious orientation was on their minds; why didn't they call it \"The Raid: Payback?\" or \"The Raid: War Lords and Druggies?\" because they want a religious connotation attached to the film, hence, they chose a religious word to amend the title! Lastly, my interpretation has been very thorough and complete, I felt it was an excellently made film and wanted my admiration for the film makers to come across in my review; I apologize if it didn't. As stated above, \"ignoring\" something being stated in art doesn't make a person better or \"tolerant,\" it means they are ignoring something, and given the well-constructed script and elements it provides, I stand by my interpretation as well as my admiration for the quality of the film."}
{"text":"Plot: Eddie Morra is a down-on-his-luck writer who comes across a drug that allows him to use his brain to its full potential.\n\nReview:\n\nIf you could know everything, would you? On one hand, you'd have all the knowledge in the world and could easily take advantage of it to gain wealth and power, among other things. On the other hand, you could never be surprised about anything. LIMITLESS, directed by Neil Burger (the man behind 2006's THE ILLUSIONIST), is a thriller film that explores the idea of ultimate knowledge, and while the film does feel a bit jumbled, overall it's an enjoyable film.\n\nThe film stars Bradley Cooper as Eddie Morra, a down-on-his-luck writer who is working on a book but is plagued by constant writer's block and hasn't gotten a word of his book down. One day, he bumps into his ex-brother-in-law Vernon Gant. Vernon is a drug dealer who offers Eddie a new drug, NZT-48, which allows him to use one hundred percent of his brain whereas most people can only use twenty percent.\n\nEddie recognizes the potential of the drug and goes to Vernon to obtain more. He finds that Vernon has been murdered, and he suspects that the killer was after the NZT. Eddie finds a hidden stash in Vernon's oven and hides it in his pants as the police arrive. He begins to start using the drug frequently and uses the stock market to build up a massive amount of wealth. Along the way he meets several characters who either want to use him or use his drug, one of them being Carl Van Loon (played by Robert De Niro), a hard-working businessman who wants to use Eddie's mind to play out his corporate takeover of various companies.\n\nThat being said, the main antagonist of this film is not Van Loon or any of the other people after Eddie; it's the drug itself. Eddie relies on this drug for everything, from something as simple as figuring out how to calm down his landlord who is demanding rent, to something as complicated as figuring out how to fight off a couple of thugs who want his drugs. Even when he is on top of the world, Eddie is still a slave to NZT-48. I liked the way this idea was handled, as it wasn't really forced down your throat, but subtly hinted at in the film.\n\nLIMITLESS is incredibly well-shot and features unique camera angles and special effects. For example, there is one scene where Eddie is cleaning his apartment while on the drug for the first time. The camera pans around the apartment, showing multiple iterations of Eddie cleaning up the apartment, all existing at the same time as if he had been cloned. In addition, color schemes are used to depict the state that a character is in while on the drugs. When Eddie first takes NZT, the colors become dull before bursting open into warm and vibrant scenery. Unique shots like these exist throughout the film and really add another layer of enjoyment to the film.\n\nThe film isn't without its faults, though. My biggest issue was the number of potential mini-storylines that were tied up in an unsatisfactory way. One in particular involves Eddie, who finds himself on a bridge after tripping out on the NZT, unable to account for the previous eighteen hours of his life. During this time, we see Eddie hook up with a wealthy young socialite, and later Eddie discovers that she was murdered. The police take him in and believe he is the murderer because a witness saw him leaving her apartment. Because Eddie was unable to account for the previous day, he isn't quite sure if he actually did kill her or not, and while the plot was eventually resolved, you never do really know if Eddie killed her, nor does it seem to bother him in the least once the plotline is resolved. There are a few more that come to mind, but I won't spoil them and will let you figure them out for yourself.\n\nIn addition, the film feels as if it's nonlinear even though it isn't. The film fluctuates between Eddie's rise and fall and rise and fall while on NZT, and the fluctuation doesn't feel natural or fluid. It almost feels as if some prankster started switching around scenes in the editing software during production and nobody noticed. It's difficult to identify with Eddie when he's benefiting from the drug during a couple of scenes and being destroyed by it in another.\n\nOverall, LIMITLESS is an intriguing thriller that is aesthetically pleasing and has a great concept. A few issues such as an unorganized plot structure and the lack of willingness to follow through with certain plotlines keep LIMITLESS from truly being great, but it's an enjoyable film regardless and is worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"As a rule, I'm not a big fan of historical epics. Character development and plot are often pushed aside in favor of meticulous set design and a sense of spectacle that is often more overwhelming than anything else. Though Master and Commander initially threatens to be exactly that sort of film, it eventually becomes a rousing and thoroughly engaging adventure movie.\n\nBased on the historical novels by Patrick O'Brian, Master and Commander follows the exploits of a 19th century British ship and her crew - with the formidable Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) at the helm. After his vessel is attacked by a French ship, Aubrey makes it his personal mission to go after and capture the perpetrators. Though Aubrey is clearly a stern and disciplined captain, his jovial friendship with the ship's doctor (played by Paul Bettany) proves that there's more than a little humanity in the man.\n\nMaster and Commander kicks off with a battle between the British and French vessels, which is followed by Aubrey's crew attempting to survive severe weather conditions. This is all before the film has bothered to introduce any of the characters to us, so it's essentially akin to watching someone play a war simulator. It's all so overpowering that it really doesn't bode well for the remainder of the movie, but thankfully, director Peter Weir does eventually slow things down. When the film stops being about cannon battles and bad weather, that's when it becomes involving.\n\nThere are a lot of very talented actors in this cast, but it's not until the movie virtually stops dead in its track that we finally get to know these characters. Though he initially seems to be a tough-as-nails disciplinarian, Aubrey is eventually revealed to be someone that cares a great deal for his men and often puts their safety first. But above all, he's a great captain and Crowe does a fantastic job of getting into Aubrey's skin; this is certainly a much better performance than his Oscar nominated turn in A Beautiful Mind. Even better is Bettany, Crowe's Beautiful Mind co-star, who is absolutely convincing as this 19th century doctor. The film's best sequence finds Bettany's character forced to operate on himself after being shot; Weir smartly keeps the camera tight on Bettany's face, and his expression says so much more than a garish close-up of the wound ever could.\n\nSome mention must be given to the astounding production design, which is incredibly detailed and ensures that the film is always interesting to look at. The interior of Aubrey's ship - from the crowded crew's quarters to the ornate senior officers mess hall - almost becomes a character in itself, which isn't all that surprising given how much time the film spends within its walls.\n\nPeter Weir proves to be quite adept at directing action sequences, ensuring that we always know what's going on and who's doing what. But his need to start the story off with a bang proves to be the weakest element of the film, and proves to be more distracting than anything else."}
{"text":"I was thinking more about Godard and the political messages he conveyed in his view of America.

It's the same thing with cities like London, Istanbul, or Beijing, which are all very spread out, but when people conceive of those cities they only think of a very small geographic area. Obviously it's different with places like Paris and Amsterdam, which are very concentrated geographically. It's frustrating but I'm just saying.\n\nWhen you take a place or a set of scenes that have become familiar (in this case in US films) and yet they are filmed\/written in such a way as to have a \"visitor\" quality to them, an out-of-kilter feeling.\n\nBrad put it very well: \"Herzog made Wisconsin look like it was on another planet.\"\n\nIf you have seen some older foreign horror movies that feature (unknown) American actors as 'the Americans' you get the same feeling. Yes, they are supposed to be the \"American scientists\" and yet the scenes feel completely off compared to a US film featuring the same characters.\n\nIt's not an undesirable effect as it certainly can mess with an audience if the filmmaker wants to.\n\nMATT: agree about Brother, but i don't think Takeshi is using the 'effect' to say anything in particular though. he is just a foreigner making a film in the U.S.\n\nshame it's not a particularly great film ;-)\n\nRenault2011\n\nabout 2 years ago\n\nIs the R1 release of Stroszek botched or can I rent it?

What do you have in your mind, gentrification and hipster boom? If that's the case then I don't recall any of that in those flicks.\n\nRenault2011\n\nabout 2 years ago\n\nI'm thinking of yuppies, gentrification, and hipsters. Yes. But then again, perhaps one needs to simply stray away from these areas to see that NYC cool still exists. Queens hasn't yet been trampled upon, thank god, nor has Harlem, or any of Manhattan above central park for that matter.\n\nMy best friend in US grew up in Queens, he still uses words like \"pisser\", it's pretty funny how much non-textbook things I know about NYC without having spent much time in the city thanks to him. Thinking about it\u2026 actually most of my friends in US grew up in NYC.

All that has had a pretty drastic effect on my accent, some people think I'm Polish immigrant from Brooklyn, no kidding there pal.\n\nDoes exoticization have everything to do with differentiation? I find it interesting how Melville requires his rather fetishized \"American\" mise-en-sc\u00e8ne to occur\/be located on the outskirts of (traditional) French civil society\u2026 In order to render things more plausible? Or more exotic? A \"plausible\" person is one who is said to be skilled at producing persuasive arguments, esp. ones intended to deceive. Is there a difference between the need to be plausible and the need to feign the exotic?\n\n\"i don't think Takeshi is using the 'effect' to say anything in particular though. he is just a foreigner making a film in the U.S.\"\n\nWell, yes, at some level it's just a grope for a segment of the American audience that might otherwise not see his films, but it's also an attempt to set the Japanese gangster (as in Yakuza) against American gangter (as in mafia) and American \"gangsta\" (as in post-modern, aestheticized version of certain aspects of street gang culture) culture. It doesn't quite come off like intended, though (at least, not for me).\n\nI think Godard was drawn to film noir because of the seamy side these movies presented of \"America.\" It fit his political sensibilities. I think Melville and Truffaut were drawn more to film noir stylistically and saw it as an effective way to present their own cinematic visions. Truffaut completely transplanted \"Shoot the Piano Player,\" setting it in Paris and the French countryside."}
{"text":"Running With Scissors lacks the edge of Augusten Burroughs' best-selling memoir. The result is an inconsistent tragicomedy that attempts to be cut from the same darkly humorous cloth as American Beauty, but fails.\n\nExperiencing Burroughs' horrendous adolescence has an appeal similar to watching an accident or its bloody aftermath. You are riveted mostly because you can't believe anything could be so awful. But when the nightmare that was his life is adapted to the screen, it becomes even more outlandish. What is lost in the translation from book to movie is emotional subtlety and pathos, which, to be fair, were in short supply to start.\n\nIn his book, Burroughs approaches the severe mental illness of his narcissistic mother (Annette Bening), the alcoholism and abandonment of his father (Alec Baldwin), his life with the most unorthodox psychiatrist on the planet (Brian Cox) and his loopy family with a sense of the absurd that only time and maturity can bring.\n\nBut it requires a very proficient filmmaker to capture the eccentricities of the story without making it seem farcical and exaggerated. We need to feel for young Augusten if the story is going to engage us.\n\nJoseph Cross' performance as Augusten is sensitive and subtle. Bening's range and innate intelligence give some meaning to the unlikable character's erratic behavior. Cox strikes just the right notes as the bizarre shrink who sees omens in his excrement. Evan Rachel Wood, Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow are also strong as the doctor's extended family.\n\nBut writer\/director Ryan Murphy blunts the power of those performances with his campy, shallow tone. The movie becomes merely a series of far-fetched and surreal atrocities committed by Augusten's mother or the psychiatrist's family who take him in.\n\nWhat ends up on the screen has an off-putting deadpan craziness that may unsettle audiences."}

What we know is that 18-year-old Jess and 12-year-old Moss are on an abandoned farm somewhere in rural Kentucky and they are alone. I spent the entire film looking for hints as to why. Where are the parents? Where are any adults? How are they eating and powering the tape players that they use to listen to their odd cassettes?\n\nThe days are long and wandering and they seem to always have something to do to occupy their time. The film doesn't follow a traditional narrative, but explores the summer through a variety of film stocks and techniques, in bits and pieces. This was a fascinating way to explore the story, giving the audience a whole bunch of pieces, but not enough to make up the whole picture.\n\nSeeing this film was like visiting an art gallery. I enjoyed not knowing everything and the sense of exploration that the viewer feels as these two characters explore the world around them.

{"text":"Contagion Realistic, But Not an All-Time Great\n\nLet's face it, most disaster movies tend to be over-budgeted films that focus on action for the sake of action and have very little\n\n(Courtesy Photo)\n\ncharacter development. Contagion, however, is not in this category. The film's story comes off as intelligent, meaningful and intriguing, yet it's maybe too far on that side of the spectrum, since the movie isn't all that exciting. It definitely holds interest \u2014 the characters and the plot are good and real enough \u2014 but it just doesn't impart a sense of wonderment that great movies undoubtedly do.\n\nContagion is gripping. Not gripping as in you're at the edge of the seat with sweat dripping down your face, but as in it has an engaging plot. From the very first sound, a cough, the plot is kick started into action. The plot is pretty straightforward, even though it jumps around perspectives, and nearly every scene deals with the massive amount of stress people are dealing with in response to the disease. The movie does a good job of creating empathy in the audience; the epidemic comes off as realistic, and many scenes can tug at the heartstrings.\n\nThe film primarily focuses on the human condition in a time of panic. Just about every viewpoint of the disaster is covered, too. Whether it's the head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, doctors struggling to find the cure, a conspiracy theorist, or a man who has just lost half his family to the disease, the perspectives cover a wide range. The quick changes in perspective, however, can be misleading, as there are many characters to follow with this third-person omniscient point of view.\n\nOne major theme of the film is how socially contagious things can be, not just in the pathological sense. A lot of the film's themes center on the rate at which fear, panic, rumors, secrets and hope can spread across a population parallel to disease. It's overwhelming to see how an idea can spread and overcome a mass of people so quickly. Though one would think the contagion is a virus, it really has much more to do with the latent definition of the word \u2013 the ready transmission or spread as of an idea or emotion from person to person.\n\nThe film is done well, but at the end of the day, it didn't have a hook to it that qualifies it as an all-time great film. That's why the movie only gets the better-than-average 3.5 stars. Sure, the movie is realistic and intriguing, but as a movie, it has a hard time entertaining. The word 'entertainment' is different to everybody; the majority of people will find the movie to be on the slower side, since there aren't tons of enticing action shots. Others will find the movie enthralling. The climax isn't incredibly exciting either. Things become underwhelming. The buildup is great, but it passively drifts to the end. The result is a good movie for thinking, but there is nothing spectacular about it. Great movies don't have to be spectacles to be great, but they do need to enchant the audience. Contagion just doesn't do that.\n\nThe level of credibility and realism in the plotline, however, helps make it worthwhile. There are little to no scenes that audiences will think, \"Well, that would never happen,\" when watching. If anything, the very real possibility of most of the situations is what is the most frightening. Even the CDC itself worked closely with the filmmakers to create a highly accurate portrayal of a growing pandemic, according to cbsnews.com. This is definitely one aspect of the film that the crew did well.\n\nOne thing that was interesting to watch was the director's editing choices. Throughout the film, there are thought-out placements of the camera that bring attention to certain emotions, or sets the mood entirely. It's pretty cool, and definitely something to look for.\n\nOne thing that will definitely pique interest is the amount of celebrities in the film. The cast ranges from the big time like Matt Damon, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and Gwenyth Paltrow to the surprisingly cast comedian Demetri Martin and Bryan Cranston of AMC's Breaking Bad fame.\n\nWhile not the most intense or thrilling disaster film out there, Contagion did a fine job of making a realistic and thought-provoking movie. It just won't go down in history as an all-time great."}

Fortunately, two outstanding actors agreed to play the lead roles. After watching this movie, I am convinced these men could make any movie entertaining. Both Jack Nickolson and Morgan Freeman on their own usually give memorable performaces in the roles they take on but putting them together like this was nothing short of briliant. Their on-screen chemistry made one believe they always had been life-long friends. This movie managed to balance chortles of laughter with a disquieting sense of mortality.

{"text":"Film review: 'Safe Haven'\n\nIt's hard to believe that just a few years ago the phrase \"based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks\" would've produced only shrugs from most moviegoers. But then \"The Notebook\" blew up in 2004, making of stars out of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, and creating a burning desire in Hollywood to adapt other books from Sparks' Southern-fried romantic\/drama oeuvre.\n\nBut here's the thing: there hasn't really been a good movie based on his material since. \"Nights in Rodanthe\" disappeared without a trace. \"Dear John\" was a dirge-like bummer, and \"The Last Song\" and \"The Lucky One\" were ill-fated coming-of-age projects for tween stars Miley Cyrus and Zac Efron.\n\nCritics hated them, but they had respectable box office tallies for low-budget films, so along comes \"Safe Haven\" as the next in the Sparks line.\n\nLike \"Dear John\" it was directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, thrice an Oscar nominee and the rare European filmmaker who seems to embrace the more saccharine aspects of Hollywood moviemaking, at his own peril. The result is a great-looking, sun-dappled story about life on the North Carolina coast that's also devoid of much dramatic or emotional heft.\n\nIt's about a woman on the run, hiding out from the law after being accused of a brutal, bloody murder. Needless to say, she falls in love with a local dreamboat, starts putting down roots and feeling secure before her haunted past shows up on her adopted doorstep.\n\nA big part of the movie's problem is Julianne Hough in the lead role. The \"Dancing with the Stars\" star has mostly done song-and-dance pictures like \"Footloose\" and \"Rock of Ages,\" and simply doesn't possess the sort of dramatic acting tools for a part like this.\n\nWe know from the get-go that Katie was an abused woman who went on the lam after stabbing her attacker, so the screenplay (by Leslie Bohem and Dana Stevens) requires her to go through some pretty major transformations -- from self-doubting victim to new gal in town coming out of her shell to strong, resourceful woman ready to take the next steps in life.\n\nBut Hough's placid exterior is more shy cheerleader than woman rising up.\n\nJosh Duhamel is better as Alex, who runs Ryan's Port Market in Southport, N.C. He's a young single dad raising two moppets after cancer took his wife. He's been keeping his head down, he says, just trying to make a life for his kids, and when he falls for Katie it's like lifting his head up again for the first time.\n\nNoah Lomax plays Josh, who's on the cusp of adolescence and testing his dad, the self-appointed protector of his mother's memory. Mimi Kirkland as Lexie reaches a level of adorableness heretofore unseen in cinematic children.\n\nKatie gets a waitressing job at Ivan's, the local seafood shack, and begins a tenuous friendship with her neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders). When Alex, noticing that Katie trudges daily from her remote cottage to the shoreline every day, gives her an old bicycle, it's Jo who instructs her that refusing gifts south of the Mason-Dixon line is a no-no -- particularly not from wounded widowers who somehow find the time to keep their abs sculpted.\n\nThe story keeps shifting back to Tierney (a creepily effective David Lyons), the Boston detective who treats tracking down Katie as much more than a standard domestic murder case. \"Nobody is innocent,\" he insists. \"We bring 'em in, and the other guy sorts 'em out.\"\n\nThings lead to a fairly predictable place, and an outcome that is never truly in doubt. Naysayers may dismiss Sparks' books as pap for undiscriminating mass consumption, but I think there's the bones of a good story in \"Safe Haven.\" It just needed a different cast and crew to find itill Bergeron\n\nWednesday, February 13, 2013 at 11:31 pm\n\nWhy do they always seem to change the story when they make a movie from the book?

{"text":"Mamet's a veteran screenwriter and director (currently producing The Unit for CBS), but that doesn't mean he has any great love for the industry-his Hollywood is the stereotypically corrupt and cutthroat world where screenwriters willingly change their stories to accommodate every stupid suggestion from producers, who are blatantly lining their own pockets, while stars bicker over who has the bigger trailer. But his stories are entertaining even when they're unsurprising, and though loosely organized, a few broad themes emerge. He expounds at length, for example, upon his well-known penchant for straightforward storytelling, where drama boils down to \"the creation and deferment of hope,\" and every scene should be able to answer three questions: \"Who wants what from whom? What happens if they don't get it? Why now?\" At other times, he's happy simply to explain why he thinks Laurence Olivier was a terrible film actor or to test out a theory that the early film industry owes its development to Eastern European Jews with Asperger's syndrome. As usual with Mamet, each word is precisely chosen for maximum effect, and nearly all hit their mark. (Feb.) (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved\n\nFrom Library Journal:\n\nFamed playwright, screenwriter, and director Mamet (On Directing Film) takes a not-very-detached look at the industry to which he has contributed (e.g., Oleanna, The Spanish Prisoner, Wag the Dog, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Glengarry Glen Ross). Although critically well received for the most part, Mamet's movies have tended to be too arcane for the general film-going public. Here, he provides practical tips drawn from his own experiences on such topics as acting and screenwriting and the \"three questions\" a writer must answer (\"Who wants what from whom?\"; \"What happens if they don't get it?\"; and \"Why now?\"). But this is not a how-to book for hopeful screenwriters or other Hollywood wannabes; instead, it is a somewhat scattershot look at all aspects of cinema that personally interest Mamet-and not necessarily in a good way. As such, it makes for quite a readable trip through his wit and wisdom, which can be considerable. However, whether he considers himself Bambi or Godzilla in the Hollywood jungle is an open question.

{"text":"Lots of things are up in the air in the opening scene of \"Safe Haven,\" unless you've ever seen a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, in which case nothing is.\n\nJulianne Hough plays a beauty on the run from the law who lands in postcard-pretty coastal Carolina to build a new life and bicker with a strapping local (Josh Duhamel). We don't know who she is or what crime she's supposed to have committed, but again, if you've seen \"The Notebook\" or \"The Lucky One\" or \"Message in a Bottle\" or \"The Vow,\" you know: She didn't do it; she'll fall in love with Strapping Local; she will eventually explain herself with the phrase, \"It's not what you think\"; and once a secret cache of poignant letters is uncovered, everyone will live happily ever after.\n\nWatching \"Safe Haven,\" I kept hoping it would turn out that Hough really is a criminal and that she would threaten to kill the mayor at a clambake, but that's not the way Sparks rolls. The appeal of movies based on his books -- and, I assume, the books themselves -- is their familiarity. Like an Agatha Christie book minus the homicidal vicars, SparksFilms are comfort food for moviegoers who want a little romance in the middle of winter.\n\nThe plotting in \"Safe Haven\" is more awkward than in other SparksFilms (the neighbor played by Cobie Smulders is the worst movie character of this young year), but Hough and Duhamel are likable enough as the will-they-or-won't-theys, and Lasse Hallstrom (\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\") directs\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwith his usual attention to detail.\n\nEven when the overall story is sinking in implausibility, there are bits of business -- between, say, Hough and one of Duhamel's kids -- that almost make you believe in these people."}

{"text":"Welcome to 'Shudder' Island\n\nIt's pretty much impossible to give a movie like \"Shutter Island\" a grade without comparing it to the director's previous works.\n\nClick image to enlarge.\n\nAdd to that fact that the film's director is Martin Scorsese and things get even more difficult, leaving most people, including me, with the verdict: \"It was a pretty good movie, but not a great Scorsese movie.\"\n\nTeddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Federal Marshall (or \"Fedah-ral Mah-shall\" as he puts it in his thick Bostonian accent) sent to a mental asylum located on an island off of Massachusetts Bay to investigate the disappearance of an escaped mental patient.\n\nThings quickly turn the usual conspiratorial \"things aren't exactly what they seem here\" way, leading Teddy deeper and deeper into the island's secrets, questioning both the safety of the island's patients as well as his own sanity.\n\nAs a thriller, \"Shutter Island\" works best in its disorienting, dream-like scenes, in which Teddy is investigating the island, not knowing if what he's seeing is real or all in his head, creating the same uneasy feeling in the audience you get when you first wake up from a nightmare, not knowing what you experienced was real or not.\n\nThe magnificent score, done by Robbie Robertson, heightens the tension, making each scene feel like a screw being twisted tighter and tighter, until the ultimate payoff at the film's conclusion. Even more effective are the scenes played with hardly any music accompaniment at all, adding to the feeling that the audience is right there with poor Leo wandering the dark and creepy halls of the asylum.\n\nThe ending that \"you'll never see coming\" is, well, not that surprising and can be seen coming from about a mile away. But even though the twist probabtly won't blow your mind. Its execution is a decent enough payoff (the twist's twist, if you will), so the audience doesn't feel totally cheated.\n\n\"Shutter Island\" is no \"Goodfellas\" (has to be said), but it's a new type of movie, even a new style, we haven't seen before from Scorsese. It doesn't break much new ground but proves Scorsese can exploit the thriller conventions just about as well as anyone else in the business, making \"Shutter Island\" still worthy of your 10 bucks."}
{"text":"CinemaOne 2011: SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION FROM LILIA CUNTAPAY Review\n\nMost\nfamous for the several short films which displayed a very casual understanding\nof the idiosyncrasies of Filipino life without relying heavily on cheap charms,\nAntoinette Jadaone has been regarded by the late Alexis Tioseco as the person\nthat is most qualified to give Filipino mainstream filmmaking that much-needed\nburst of novel inspiration. Tioseco's observations are very much valid,\nconsidering that Jadaone's shorts are all tightly packaged confections that\nmarry the popular appeal of mainstream escapist entertainment and the unique\nwit of more adventurous fare. The only concern remaining is whether or not\nJadaone can replicate and sustain the irresistible charms of her short films in\na feature length film. Fortunately, Six\nDegrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay is more than enough proof that\nshe can.\n\nLilia\nCuntapay, the film's endearing subject, is the perennial extra, playing nameless\ncharacters in various films. Perhaps because of her distinctly memorable\nfeatures, she has been type-casted to play hags or ghosts in horror films.\nCuntapay is actually most famous for having a face that is easier to recall\nthan her name. Six Degrees of Separation\nfrom Lilia Cuntapay springs from that unique fame of Cuntapay, opening with\na montage of popular actors and directors who have all worked with Cuntapay who\ncan't seem to recall who Lilia Cuntapay is, until Peque Gallaga, who discovered\nCuntapay while shooting one of the episodes of Shake Rattle & Roll 2 (Gallaga and Lore Reyes, 1990), breaks\nthe name's supposed unfamiliarity to describe Cuntapay's strange appeal.\n\nSet\nin a fictional scenario wherein Cuntapay gets a very surprising nomination as\nBest Supporting Actress, a filmmaker (played by Jadaone) ventures into Cuntapay's\nneighborhood to document Cuntapay's life a few days prior to the awards night.\nThe film follows Cuntapay as she goes to work to play another nameless role for\na television melodrama, or as she excitedly sets up a viewing event for her\nfirst-ever interview for a popular primetime news program, or as she tearfully\nrecounts her memorable past few days to her stepdaughter who lives in Canada.\n\nDespite\nthe numerous humorous depictions of a woman who has always settled to be in the\nfringes of an industry whose main currency is popularity, the film remains a\nvery human portrait of Cuntapay, who suddenly finds herself in the brink of her\nlong-ambitioned recognition. Six Degrees\nof Separation from Lilia Cuntapay succeeds not only because it seamlessly\nmerges fact and fiction or because it manages to tackle a personality who\nexists in the margins of Filipino pop culture within a context of absolute familiarity\nbut because it is genuinely touching. As the film reveals Cuntapay's other\nsides, as longing mother to an absentee stepdaughter, as dutiful mentor to her\npatient assistant (Geraldine Villamil), as a beloved and loving neighbor, it\ngraduates from merely being just a witty and hilarious satire into something\nmore worthwhile, more enduring.\n\nJadaone\nmay have just made the quintessential Filipino underdog movie. Cuntapay is in\nfact the quintessential Filipino underdog. She struggles in a world of pretty\nfaces, supple breasts, and pleasant gestures, despite the fact that she is the\nepitome of the complete opposite of what her world values the most. She is\nsomeone to be rooted for, not exactly to be given the fame and fortune luckier\ntalents would normally aim for but only to be recognized, to be given a\npermanent place in that world she has devoted her life and uniqueness to but cannot\ngive the same devotion to her. Jadaone's film, rooted in that fantasy that someone\nwho has persisted for so long like Lilia Cuntapay may actually cross-over to be\npitted against established and talented actresses in a glittery awards ceremonies,\nis a heartfelt tribute to each and every person who dared to dream dreams as\nbig (and probably far-fetched) as the ones dreamt by Lilia Cuntapay"}

The timing of the story really couldn't have been any better considering the times we are living in, with the wall street protests we've had, and all the talk about the privileged 1%, I think Don Delillo was a visionary of sort considering he wrote Cosmopolis well before the 2008 collapse of the American economy and before the phrase \"the 1%\" became part of our everyday lexicon. This film is really about how life can change in the blink of an eye, for anyone.\n\nYet, at the end of the day, this film isn't really like anything else I've seen, it can't really be compared to the 1980's film Wall Street, yet it isn't as complicated as everyone makes it out to be either. Without giving away to much, you the viewer, will get to live vicariously through Eric Packer for a day, as the precocious, promiscious, stoic young man tries to get across town in his custom limo just to get a haircut at his preferred babershop. Eric wants what he wants even if the ride will cost him on many levels and as the film progress you start to feel for Eric and wonder why he continues on his current path.\n\nAbout Robert, he did a great job at bringing Eric Packer to life. I am used to seeing complicated roles like this going to more seasoned actors like Leo DiCaprio and Viggo Mortenson but Robert was just as engaging and I think Cronenberg selected his leading man wisely.

{"text":"Bernie\n\nRichard Linklater's 14th feature chronicles the strange but true tale of Bernie Tiede (Jack Black), the young man who arrived in Carthage, Texas with some neatly pressed shirts and pants, a smart little moustache, a gift for politeness and a mortuary degree, and Mrs Nugent (Shirley MacLaine), the crabby, extremely wealthy old widow loathed by everyone in town. Bernie and Mrs Nugent became close companions, so close that, despite Bernie's apparent homosexuality, many wondered if their relationship didn't include a sexual component. But that relationship became increasingly oppressive for Bernie, and one day in 1997 Bernie shot and killed Mrs Nugent, hiding her body in a freezer. No one discovered her for nine months.\n\nInspired by Skip Hollandsworth's 1998 Texas Monthly profile of the case, which much of the film quotes directly, Bernie comfortably hovers somewhere between semi-staged documentary and true crime feature. It's a black comedy and place study narrated by a chorus of townsfolk (the cast mixes actual Carthagians and hired actors, including Matthew McConaughey and The Whole Shootin' Match's Sonny Carl Davis) speaking direct-to-camera from front stoops or greasy spoons or seated before farm equipment. Their Bernie is a Robin Hood figure, killing the rich and donating to the town: murder as a benevolent act. \"He had the ability to make the world seem kind,\" one of the locals says. Linklater, a Texan himself, exudes affection for his subjects and their things (check out the attention to detail in the set dressing, ie: the horse painting lampshade on Scrappy Holmes' desk). Told from the inside out, Bernie neither condescends nor soft-pedals, and seems ever-fascinated by its own incongruities and enigmas.\n\nI'd never spoke to Linklater before, but found him just as friendly and easygoing as I'd always assumed he'd be from watching his films, some of which feature an occasional director's cameo. He appears in Bernie as a deadbeat dad engaged in one of those weird contests where you have to keep your hands on a car for as long as possible.\n\nVUE WEEKLY: I realize that the film is called Bernie, but I was really struck by how beautifully it works as a portrait of a community. RICHARD LINKLATER: When Shirley first read the script she said to me, \"Really, it's the gossips' movie.\" I laughed. To some degree that's true, because it's seen through their eyes.\n\nVW: That's just it. The film refrains from psychoanalyzing Bernie. It offers little about his roots. It doesn't try to get inside his head. Instead you build your portrait as much as possible from the perceptions of the Carthagians. You let them author your Bernie. RL: We'll never know what really happened between Bernie and Mrs Nugent, but we do know the effect their relationship had on Carthage. It always seemed like the most interesting choice to hear these multiple voices testify to how the events reverberated through the community. Such events are more poignant in a small town, because everyone really does know each other. Small town gossip has this unanimity to it: Bernie was the nicest guy in town and Mrs Nugent was the meanest bitch. Life is high school. Ultimately you are what everybody says you are. If you were to go to Carthage today and get in line at Sam's barbecue, you might find someone telling you how Bernie should have done it\u2014without getting caught.\n\nVW: One of the really intriguing things about this whole story is the way the themes of disguise and the denial of death weaves its way through Bernie's vocation and right into his crime. RL: Even in death we disguise ourselves. There's that telling line from the opening scene, where Bernie's demonstrating his craft: \"You don't want him to look unhappy to be there.\" [Laughs] I heard that from a lady who dresses the dead as her job. She was our consultant, giving me some pointers. I thought it was hilarious. I don't think she thought it was funny.\n\nVW: The casting of Jack Black was really inspired. He's very funny as Bernie, but he also has this quality, this very particular pathos, that feels both native to the character and distinctly Jack Black. RL: I'm so proud of Jack's work here. When you're funny no one thinks you're a good actor, but the truth is Jack's a great actor. And a great singer. And both skills are required for this part. Jack has this ingratiating element; he wants to be liked. But then there's this tinge somewhere in Jack that's a little off. This edge. That edge itself is funny. It's forever intriguing. That's what makes him a movie star.\n\nVW: You've been carrying around the idea for Bernie since 1998. Did your concept of the film change a lot over the years? RL: Not much. All I did the whole time was think about the tone, and that was beneficial. Everything clicked when we met the actual Bernie. I had been writing to him for years, but when Jack and I got to visit him in prison it kind of confirmed all my hunches. He truly did seem like the nicest guy who did this one horrible act. To me, that was the story. He's not a psychopath, so the question arises as to whether any of us, under the right circumstances, could be driven to kill somebody.\n\nVW: The scene where Bernie pulls the trigger really isn't especially dramatic. It's just this moment where the barrier between fantasy and action becomes so slim. RL: And it's so easy with certain weapons. It happens in a flash.\n\nVW: Have you given any thought to whether you'd like to be buried or cremated? Would you like someone like Bernie to prepare your remains for your grieving loved ones? RL: [Laughs] That's a great question. I've spent all these years thinking about the death industry and you're the only person to ask me that question. So I'll tell you honestly, because you deserve it: I will in no way let the death industry get close to me when I die! [Laughs] I've been researching this and there's this thing called green burial. You die, they put you in a biodegradable stack, bury you vertically so you don't take up much room and you immediately return to the soil. You don't kill a bunch of roots. They just throw you out in the woods, really. It's the least you do can do and it only costs about $200 instead of $10 000. The idea of putting all these fluids in your body and going through all this rigmarole to act like you're not dead is just crazy. It's a horrible industry, really.\n\nVW: I know. This whole idea that you can buy a casket that will keep worms off your body for an extra hundred years. At some point, when the people that loved you and even all your grandchildren have all died, you know, maybe it's time to finally let go. I've always liked the idea of cremation, though I hadn't really thought about the pollution aspect. RL: That's an issue. And it's expensive because of the fire, and because they still do all these things to treat the body beforehand. Mind you, they make you think you have to do so many things, but if you check the books there's actually very little that you're obligated to do, legally.\n\nVW: Well, I hope that neither you nor your loved ones will have to be thinking about your death rites for a very long time. RL: Thanks, but we all get there sooner or later. Thinking about it's not so bad"}
{"text":"Plot Summary: At 43, Jean-Dominique Bauby (Mathieu Amalric), editor-in-chief of Elle magazine, has a devastating stroke, which leaves him almost completely paralyzed and unable to communicate except by blinking one eye.\n\nHeather Huntington\n\nReelzChannel.com, November 30, 2007\n\nIt's shocking to say a movie is better than the book from which it was adapted, but is it a sacrilege when that book was literally blinked out letter by letter by a person who paralyzed everywhere except one eyelid? If so, get my hand basket ready Satan, 'cuz I'm coming for a visit.\n\nAdapted from the memoir of the same name, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is the true story of Jean-Dominique Beauby, the editor of ElleFrance, who had a massive stroke at the age of 43 that left him completely paralyzed--with the exception of one eye. His speech therapist figured out a way for him to communicate by blinking, allowing him to communicate with his friends and family and to record his experience.\n\nIt sounds excruciating, like another \"physically challenged protagonist who overcomes\" movie in love with its own Oscar marketability. But it is absolutely anything but. In fact The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is gorgeous from the very second it hits the screen--with the opening credits super-ed over X-rays and set to the incongruously perky sounding tones of Charles Trenet singing \"La Mer\" announcing its brilliance from the get go. And with the genius of eccentric director Julian Schnabel (Basquiat) and superstar Janusz Kaminski (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler'sList) behind the camera, you start to understand why.\n\nRonald Harwood's (The Pianist, Being Julia) script is simply remarkable--from the sheer beauty of the language to the ingenious idea to tell the story from Beauby's perspective (for a good chunk of the movie you only see what he sees and his thoughts are voiced over) to the effortless motion between the imagination sequences and reality to the unexpected humor and levity. He did the near unmanageable with a screenplay adaptation--he preserved the essence and the spirit of the book and expanded on it in a way that gave us even better, more intense and personal access to the character.\n\nThe acting is magnificent. Max von Sydow (Beauby's father) brings the audience to tears, and more importantly, as Beauby himself, Mathieu Amalric (Munich, Marie Antoinette) gets an absolutely world of traction out of one eye. The result is an emotional tour de force that is simply stunning all around.\n\nWere it not for the fact that The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is in French, it would likely get a nomination in every Oscar category there is. But the fact remains--even if Schnabel and some of the production team were American, the movie has French actors, is in French, and it feels French. And that will probably deter a lot of American audiences, which is a shame because they'll be missing out on what is without question one of the best movies of the year."}
{"text":"A Misogynist Melodrama\n\nYes, Penelope Cruz too can go ugly\/pathetic for critical acclaim. It's done the trick for so many other beautiful actresses: Halle Berry, Nicole Kidman, and Charlize Theron won Oscars this way, and Cruz received Best Actress from the European Film Awards for her unfortunate transformation into Italia, the destitute, uneducated, whiny, weepy peasant who falls madly in love with the man who mistreats her.\n\nGive her some tacky blue eye shadow, wobbly high heels, a horrendous hair cut, some false front teeth and Cruz really does look bad. She certainly doesn't seem like the kind of woman a successful doctor would want to rape, impregnate, buy shoes and risk ruining his life for. Which is exactly what happens in Sergio Castellitto's preposterously bad film \"Don't Move.\"\n\nThere are almost too many things wrong with this melodrama to really get into it: the overbearing theme music and the cinematically pouring rain, the series of flashbacks, all the crying, brooding, and the passion. Expect lots of ugly sex, mainly in uncomfortable places. Add to that the film's manipulative framing: a potentially fatal motorbike accident. While doctors perform emergency brain surgery on Timotheo's darling daughter, the weary father paces the hospital halls, remembering his tragic affair with his tragic peasant.\n\n\"Don't Move\" has the added bonus of being terrifically misogynist. Upper class Timotheo (performed by director Castellitto) doesn't love his beautiful, independent wife (Claudia Gerini.) In fact, he resents her for her competence, desiring instead the needy, less attractive waif--precisely because she needs him. Timotheo can sexually assault his new woman, time after time, and always come back for more! What more does a man want? Based on Margaret Mazzantini's prize winning novel, this romantic tear jerker aims to be a moving love story, but the squalid relationship between Timotheo and Italia--based on power and economic privilege\u2014will turn your stomach."}

{"text":"Children of Men\n\nIn 2027, the human race is dying. No one is able to give birth and the last child, born over eighteen years ago, has just died. With no hope, governments are toppling and England is one of the last civilized countries still standing. Naturally, this makes them a magnet for immigrants from around the world and the government enacts very tough immigration laws, rounding up new immigrants at the border, putting them in camps and then shipping them out again. Entire sections of London and England have been fenced off, acting as concentration camps and deportation stations. Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) gets through his days with as much alcohol as possible, walking through all of this madness with a numbness allowing him to cope. He also visits his friend, Jasper (Michael Caine), a former political cartoonist living off the grid with his catatonic wife, a former journalist in a secluded house where jasper grows pot. When the youngest man in the world dies, a new string of violence and desperate acts causes everyone to become even more agitated. Theodore is kidnapped and blindfolded by a terrorist group. As they remove the mask, he finds himself sitting in front of his ex-wife, Julian (Julianne Moore), the leader of the terrorist group. She needs Theodore's help to get papers for Kee (Claire Hope-Ashitey), a young black woman. They want to get her to the coast and into the hands of a group called the Human Project. Why all this fuss for the girl? She is pregnant.\n\n\"Children of Men\", written and directed by Alfonso Cuaron (\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\", \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azbakan\") is a bleak, but interesting look at the future. Cuaron apparently used the \"Harry Potter\" film as a bargaining chip to get this film made and it resembles a passion project every step of the way. Throughout the film, the story takes turns most big budget Hollywood films would not and could not showing the passion and clout the director has used to get the project made.\n\nLondon in the year 2027 is a crowded, dirty, bleak place filled with people who are gray and dour. Hopefully, this is not your stereotypical vision of London today, because it is much more than this. But Cuaron and his team have drained all of the extra bits out of the future vision of this great city. Large plasma billboards have been erected advertising a drug you can use to gently put you to sleep forever and they'll pay two thousand pounds to your next of kin. They also continuously remind people to report illegal refugees, who have been nicknamed 'Fugees'. The buildings are dark and gray and people look consistently depressed. In addition, parts of London have been walled off, patrolled by security, and reserved for the use of the privileged; they have parks to walk their dogs, to lead an existence cut off from the rest of the world. The production design for this film is complete and very Oscar worthy. Unfortunately, it helps create a very realistic view of a future that is extremely depressing.\n\nClive Owen has always been an interesting actor and he brings a conviction to the role of Theodore, making him believable and real. From the first moments, Theodore is clearly a numb individual and Owen makes this a part of his character throughout. Yes, he has a moment or two of enjoyment when he visits Jasper (Caine) at his home, but he lives in a world where there is little to enjoy or be happy about. He walks around in a fog, desperate to add some alcohol from his ever ready flask into a Styrofoam cup of black coffee. But even this moment of respite is interrupted by a bomb at the coffee shop.\n\nTheodore is a very reluctant hero. Too many years of living in this society have numbed him to anything but a mere existence. But he has also been personally affected by the problem; he and Julian lost a son to an illness at the beginning of this madness, breaking them up and causing Julian to take some action. It causes Theodore to become depressed and stay that way. But when Julian calls him to action, the memory of their son and the possibility of getting back together, lead him to help out.\n\nThere is a lot going on in \"Men\" and Cuaron and his co-writer Timothy Sexton thrust us into the middle of the action, sometimes explaining things, but more often than not, we have to catch up and pick up little pieces of information here and there. This seems like the smart thing to do; if the film had to stop every time something new happened and explain why the story would never go anywhere. We learn the human race is infertile and that is enough. We learn a little about Jasper and his wife through a camera pan across newspaper clippings. We learn some about the society through brief comments. Stopping to fully explain everything would make the film too long and full of lengthy, preachy passages. Cuaron has made the right choice.\n\nJulianne Moore's Julian is a strong character who benefits from this lack of exposition. How did she and Theo meet? What happened to their son? Why did she go off to join this terrorist group? Or did she in fact start the group? We don't learn a lot about these things, but that isn't as important as their relationship. We have to feel that they still care or each other and we do. The moment they set eyes on one another, we see a little of the old spark, below all of the pain and anguish.\n\nMichael Caine turns in a memorable performance as Jasper, the former political cartoonist who is now content to care for his wife and grow pot, which he supplies to the guards at a nearby Fugee Detention Center. His role is funny and helps to bring a few brief moments of comic relief to the film. It is a testament to Caine's acting that he is able to make us care so much about his character in such a brief time. It is a testament to Cuaron that such a brief appearance seems so natural and fully integrated into the rest of the story.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor plays Luke, Julian's second in command. For much of the film, he is accompanying Theo or chasing Theo and Kee, trying to keep the pregnant girl in their control. His role doesn't allow for a lot of emotion, and he appears cold throughout. But he does appear tenacious.\n\nAfter Theo meets Kee, the film becomes much more linear. Theo has his assignment; he must get Kee to the Human Project, who will meet them at a specific time, on the Coast. From that moment forward, the clock is ticking and everything but getting her to these people becomes unimportant. Initially, Theo has a large group of people to help, but slowly, they disappear, are injured, killed, leave as a few more people join in. Soon, it is just Theo and Kee.\n\nAs they get closer and closer to their goal, we see more and more evidence of why this pregnant mother is so important to the survival of the human race and why Theo is so determined to help her. They travel through some terrible obstacles and meet some unusual people along the way. And the journey is never anything less than interesting. Along the way, Theo realizes what she could mean and we see her through his eyes.\n\nBut Cuaron's picture of the future is bleak. And consistent. This is not one of the most uplifting films I have ever seen, but it is an interesting one.\n\nDon't go to this film if you are feeling depressed. It might send you over the edge."}

It makes viewers think realism is just another style in art, so that no movie, no matter how realistic it looks, is believable.\n\nThe affable and talented Ben Affleck has admitted his film's climax, with Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers jumping in a jeep, chasing the plane down the runway and shooting at it, was fabricated for excitement.\n\nAuthenticity vs entertainment\n\nHollywood always wants it both ways, of course, but this Oscar season is rife with contenders who bank on the authenticity of their films until it's challenged, and then fall back on the \"Hey, it's just a movie\" defence.\n\nZero Dark Thirty, \"based on first-hand accounts of actual events\", has been faulted for leaving the impression that torture was instrumental in the capture of Osama. It celebrates Jessica Chastain's loner character, Maya, when it could have more accurately and theatrically highlighted \"the Sisterhood\", a team of female CIA analysts in the long effort.\n\nAnd then there's the kerfuffle over Lincoln, which had three historical advisers but still managed to make some historical bloopers. Joe Courtney, a Democratic congressman from Connecticut, recently wrote to Steven Spielberg to complain that Lincoln falsely showed two of Connecticut's House members voting nay against the 13th amendment as rejects the idea that he has defamed Connecticut or the real lawmakers who voted aye. He said that in historical movies, as opposed to history books where you go for \"a blow-by-blow account\", it is acceptable to \"manipulate a small detail in the service of a greater historical truth.

{"text":"Combining a police procedural with a musical comedy, the Swedish film Sound of Silence brings a comedic and thought provoking take to the crime caper genre. It's a film that reveres the art of music, while simultaneously criticizing it, and although the final act becomes a bit muddled, it's still an easy recommendation for any music lover.\n\nOn the surface, Sound of Noise is about a group of rogue percussionists, who set out to make the ultimate flash-mob-esque street music, and the police detective charged with bringing them to justice. The film follows Sanna (Sanna Persson), the quasi-leader of the musicians, and Amadeus (Bengt Nilsson), the tone-deaf detective who's desperately trying to track the group down.\n\nSound of Noise plays out like a typical cop flick, except instead of watching heists or murders, we see quirky musical interludes, followed by Amadeus investigating the crime scene and piecing together clues. It's in these interludes that the film is at it's best. The musical numbers are entertaining, comedic, and ingenious. Who would have thought playing a fat guy's gut like bongos would produce such a great rhythm?\n\nBut this isn't just a cops and robbers story. It's a statement on the rigidity and confinement of traditional music, and a call to arms for those musicians willing to experiment, and attempt something new. It has that \"Music is all around us, we just need to listen,\" vibe going for it. This is most apparent when looking at the relationship between Amadeus and his family. He comes from a family of musicians, and his younger brother is a famous composer, however Amadeus never had an interest in music and is tone deaf. This leads to some of the film's more existential moments, which unfortunately didn't really work.\n\nIn addition to these almost supernatural elements, it becomes clear within the first act of the film that there would be an inevitable love story between Sanna and Amadeus. This was not problematic to the plot, but it felt slightly tacked on by the end. In a film that has so many other things happening, it seems like adding a love story at the climax is just unnecessary.\n\nWith clever music, and a nice blend of comedy and heart, you'll find yourself smiling and tapping your toes throughout most of the movie. While it may not move you like a Haydn symphony, this is still an entertaining film, and is a must-see for any music aficionado."}

{"text":"If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.\n\nSaturday, November 24, 2007\n\nMovies: No Country For Old Men\n\nYour enjoyment of the Coen brothers' latest film, \"No Country For Old Men\" (based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name), depends chiefly on how much pleasure you derive from a very particular worldview; the movie can be summed up as \"Gnostic dualism with firepower.\" The characters, including blue-collar protagonist Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin, who is having a career-making year), are trapped inside a material world that doesn't take bravery or goodness into the equation.\n\nMoss stumbles upon a failed drug deal and a big bag filled with unmarked bills while hunting out in the desolate Texas plains. Rather than leave well enough alone, he takes the money, bringing the inevitable attention of a whole bunch of folks, among them Chigurh (a remorseless killer tracking the money, played expertly by Javier Bardem), angry Mexican drug dealers, and a Texas sherriff (Tommy Lee Jones, essentially playing the same role he's played in every other movie - a weathered law enforcement officer). It's typical Coen brothers territory - money, greed, and sporadic bouts of extreme violence.\n\nWhat isn't typical is the worldview. This movie is the polar opposite of \"Fargo,\" both in setting and in its larger meaning. \"Fargo\" had Frances McDormand's \"Margie,\" a paragon of virtue in a horrible world. \"No Country\" is far more bleak in its assessment of what happens when a good cop meets unspeakable, almost insane violence. It wasn't really effective for me, but your mileage may vary.\n\nThe standout role in the movie is Chigurh. Bardem gifts the character with an unwavering, almost predatorial intensity - you feel that even if Chigurh got the money, he wouldn't really know what to do with it. Chigurh is a sociopath in the strict, DSM-IV sense - he does not follow society's norms, but he is not irrational or wild. And yes, he carries the coolest movie weapons I've seen in awhile - a suppressed shotgun and a cattle gun."}

No other genre is filled with as many\narchetypes as fantasy.\n\nBuilt on a foundation of religious allegory, fables, fairytales, myths\nand legends the characters and storylines that dominate fantasy are intricately\nwoven into our collective and historical consciousness. And even when\nthere are no tangible connections, historically or geographically between\ncultures, variants of these stories appear in traditions around the world\ntime and time again.\n\nVersions of Cinderella have appeared in Korea, Russia, Vietnam and West\nAfrica. Nearly every post-Star Wars geek knows that, via Joseph Campbell\nand his Hero with a Thousand Faces, Lucas found inspiration for Luke's\nstory in the myriad of hero myths that have existed as long as man has\nbeen telling stories.\n\nIncreasing the difficulty for McKean and Gaiman are the number of iconic\nfantasy films that are a part of our film language. So when a story is\nas underdeveloped as MirrorMask's is, imaginative creatures like\nMcKean and Gaiman's sphinx instantly bring Alice in Wonderland's\nCheshire cat to mind. When the Dark Queen's mannequin-like servants\ndress Helena, one thinks of the singing and dancing mice from Cinderella's\nball gown sequence.\n\nThere's even a touch of Japanese animation powerhouse Hayao Miyazaki\n(Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle) in not only the story's\nflow, but also in the design of the both the creatures and the world they\ninhabit. (The Miyazaki influence probably isn't a coincidence considering\nGaiman scripted the English translation of Princess Mononoke.)\n\nThese allusions wouldn't be such a distraction if MirrorMask had\nsome concrete whys and what-fors. Gaiman's screenplay offers us\nseveral, but neither he nor McKean's direction ever settles on any\nof them.\n\nIs Helena's quest to save her mother, or is it to have her mother\naccept her as she is? What exactly is the point of Helena's doppelganger?\nWas she real or was she, as a product of Helena's guilt, Helena's\nimmaturity personified? Why is Helena's relationship with her mother\nso much more acrimonious than with her father? And of course there's\nthe big question that remains unanswered. Was Helena's journey real\nor imagined?\n\nThe impression is that either both McKean and Gaiman, knowing how familiar\nHelena's quest would be to most audiences, made a conscious decision\nto rely on the production design to gloss over the gaps \u2014 which\nis unlikely. Or, in trying to cover so much territory in a two hour movie,\nwere simply overambitious. (Allegedly, McKean and Gaiman outlined the\nstory over a three day period and it was during filming that they filled\nin the details.)\n\nOne of the strengths of a novel is that not only can it raise a thousand\nquestions, there's enough space to give a thousand contradictory\nanswers and still leave an audience satisfied. And watching MirrorMask\nI couldn't help feel that as a novel the story would have had been\nmore than just the sum of its parts. But, no matter how inspired the imagery\nof MirrorMask is, as a film, it's a hurdle that McKean and Gaiman\njust can't overcome.\n\nCharles Judson is a local screen and comic book writer and regular reviewer for cinemATL."}

I invested two hours into this time sink before dashing for the exit. The religious mumbo-jumbo didn't do a thing for me either. Pseudo-intellectual garbage."}
{"text":"A dystopian future where the United States has been divided into twelve districts, each of which must send two children as tributes in a battle to the death, \u00e0 la Theseus and the Minotaur. Sounds like fantastic fodder for a young adult book, right? Somehow, though, Suzanne Collins' book, \"The Hunger Games,\" and its subsequent sequels have become unprecedentedly popular, a remarkable feat when most teenagers' reading is done in 140 characters or less.\n\nAs movie studios always want to do with successful books (especially those with well over 20 million copies in print), a movie adaptation was ordered. Adapting beloved books is a tricky task, as they turn everyone into a critic, and it is impossible to please everyone.\n\nSomehow, though, director Gary Ross has pulled off the unimaginable, both literally and figuratively. The odds were ever against Ross making a successful, pleasing movie of \"The Hunger Games.\" While the book is chock full of images, it is also rife with challenges from a filmmaking perspective. Undaunted, Ross, together with Collins, who served as a screenwriter and producer, tackled every issue and dealt with it in a creative and imaginative way.\n\nIn the unlikely case that you are reading this review but have not read the book, I first of all recommend that you go out and read the book. It's scintillating and you probably won't be able to put it down. If, for some reason, you are still reading this and have ignored my advice to read the book (but really, do!), herein follows a brief plot summary. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 16-year-old huntress from the destitute District 12. When her beloved little sister's name is chosen at random to participate in the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to compete in her place. She is then whisked off to the Capitol with her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), a boy she barely knows, but with whom she already has a storied past. Soon enough, the games begin, and both are entered into a desperate battle to the death.\n\nAs a whole, the acting in the movie is quite good. Lawrence, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her work on the tonally similar \"Winter's Bone\" is particularly strong as the heroine\u2014thankfully, as she occupies the screen about 95% of the time. The rest of the cast is rounded out quite well with both Hollywood veterans (including Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, and Elizabeth Banks) and relative newcomers, as Katniss' fellow Tributes.\n\nOne of Ross' greatest successes is in his departures from the original text. While the experience of seeing the book's pages come to life is an unparalleled delight, the new material, which gives glimpses into the machinations of the Hunger Games, is even more of a treat. Additionally, the editing does a wonderful job of keeping the pace of the film moving along at a good clip and gives unexpected insight to Katniss' experience inside the Games.\n\nWhile the film is not faultless (some of the special effects are less than stellar, and there are some self-indulgent and groan-worthy moments of melodrama), it creates an incredibly compelling story. The movie is almost two and a half hours long, but does not seem it, and, more importantly, leaves the audience yearning for more. All in all, \"The Hunger Games\" is an incredibly engaging and enjoyable exploration of a possible post-apocalyptic future."}

{"text":"June 30, 2011\n\nI know. Who cares what I think? If you don't, then you don't have to read. If you do, then go ahead.\n\nTerrence Malick's The Tree of Life is a pretty, poetic, and even confusing film created from a white, privileged, hetero male perspective. Necessarily. But to those who think The Tree of Life is all about boyhood (Roger Ebert): it probably is to you, but I beg to differ. The only person that walked out of the theater when I saw it last night was a man. My boyfriend liked it less than I liked it. But we both found plenty to say about the movie and talked about it for hours afterwards. He found it confusing and inaccessible. I found it pretty and fruitful. For whatever that's worth.\n\nNone of the characters are realistic; they are all excellent conglomerations of pieces of people with both endearing and revolting traits. The mom was so unrealistically perfect, a pure mother Mary, and the dad so Biblically Old Testament doling out \"loving\" punishment, that we recognize them both as people we know, but not entirely. They are archetypes. They serve as metaphors of strict gender roles in a Judeo-Christian Western civilization. It is sad that a mom won't speak up and a dad won't shut up. Things I've learned in life: don't expect a revolutionary message from Brad Pitt. Or Terrence Malick, for that matter.\n\nStill, some of the themes are universal. To me, The Tree of Lifeis a meditation about nature v. grace, or the cruelty and goodness found simultaneously in nature, humanity, and history. I think most Arab Muslims and American Christians and Tibetan Buddhists would agree that humans are interested in the struggle between cruelty and goodness within our souls and in our environment.\n\nWhy do young boys get together and strap a frog to an exploding rocket? Why does a big brother put his little brother in danger? Why does a little brother trust so unconditionally? Why did a sweet 19 year old boy die? Why did God take him? Nobody knows. It is disgustingly sad that parents outlive their children, yet it is a fucking terrible truth.\n\nI don't know if you've ever had someone very close to you die. But when my dad died when I was 19, my thoughts turned to God and the Universe and BIG, mysterious, unanswerable questions. I wrote letters and emails and journal entries that didn't make a lick of sense; I'm sure my best friend at the time thought I was going crazy. The week after my dad died, I went back to college, and I bought a strand of Christmas lights, and I put them up on my dormroom wall in the shape of a tree. I told everyone who came to visit me that it was the 'Tree of Life.' No kidding. I still have pictures of it. Maybe I was going crazy, or maybe I was grieving.\n\nTo me, the human mind is hard-wired toward nostalgia. It is hard to sit in reality when you are greiving. You'll let your mind wander. Anywhere but the pain of here and now is better, you think. We grow into adults and get unhappy and look back. But Malick's film reminds us that we might all do well to notice how the buildings and bridges and the trees and planets and jellyfish are endlessly curious. Humans may be innately impatient and in a hurry; but I'm convinced capitalism makes this worse. See the modern-day character played by Sean Penn. It is sad how a little boy can grow up to be the man he knew he would become, but didn't try or want to become.We should all pay attention more.\n\nExcept when CGI dinosaurs appear on-screen. WHY!?! They made me cringe like when my mom says something awkward in the middle of a delicious dinner. I'm just gonna pretend it didn't happen.\n\nBack to the one thing every viewer and reviewer of the movie seems compelled to acknowledge: this movie is gorgeous. Roger Ebert was on to something when he said, \"Rarely does a film seem more obviously a collaboration of love between a director and his production designer, in this case, Jack Fisk.\" Awe. And I would say the wardrobe designer deserves some props, too. So here's to Jacqueline West! I loved the wardrobe. Loved. Every. Dress. That. Mama. Wore.\n\nOften, we want direct messages, commandments almost. But we don't get that with The Tree of Life, and I respect that Malick, instead, offers up a scenic-route meditation. I like the scenic route. I take it whenever possible.\n\nSeptember 5, 2009\n\nCaster Semenya\n\nMaybe you all have heard the story of Caster Semenya, the South African runner who won the 800m gold medal at the world championships recently; she is amazing, and fast, and muscular, and doesn't wear her hair down when she runs. Then, lo and behold, concerns were raised that she wasn't really a female. So the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), put her through several tests- including hormonal, gynecological!, and psychological- to prove she was a female.\n\n#1 Testosterone levels vary from person to person, from male to male, and from female to female. They also vary at different times of the month, different times of your life (increasing during puberty), even at different times during any given day (highest in the morning), and over the course of any given activity (levels drop after ejaculation, for instance). They often increase under pressure or when risk or harm is posed to an individual. They also increase in winners of a competition and decrease in the losers of a competition!\n\nTo summarize, my first point is that TESTOSTERONE LEVELS ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND MYSTERIOUS TO PROVE SOMETHING AS BANAL AS WHETHER OR NOT AN INDIVIDUAL IS MALE OR FEMALE.\n\n#2 People who have been writing about this case, as well as the people who are conducting the testing of Semenya make no distinction between the terms 'SEX' and 'GENDER.' See ESPN. See The Guardian. See USA Today. What's the big difference, you ask? It is this: SEX refers to the type of reproductive organs you are born with. What's between your legs, to put is vulgarly. However, and this is a big however, more than two sexes exist in ALL animal species, especially the human species. When you are born with a mash-up, a variety, a rainbow of XX AND XY chromosomes, you are intersex. Sometimes, being intersex shows up at birth (which presents a real problem for these babies because they encounter all kinds of doctor and parental biases toward \"girls\" and \"boys\".) But sometimes nobody, not even you yourself will know that you are born with both kinds of chromosomes. Sometimes, men have a penis, produce offspring, feel and look like a regular dude, but upon autopsy after they die, they are found to also have a set of ovaries! This chart is very enlightening if you want to look into intersex diversity further.\n\nOkay, so what is 'GENDER'? Gender is how an individual identifies her or himself. Period. That's it, in my humble opinion. And, this is why, to me, the Caster Semenya story is such a tragedy. She says she's a girl. She was raised as a girl. She wore skirts to school for cryin' out loud! No matter what any doctor with ten degrees says, or what endocrinology tests show, there is only one expert on Caster Semenya's gender, and that is Caster Semenya!\n\nThe test results may show that she is intersex or whatever, but that doesn't prove she was cheating, nor do I think that means that she should be disqualified. It means that the categories that sports and the rest of our society have constructed are too plain to contain our complexities as human beings.\n\nI also think that she is being poked and prodded like a fuckin' animal, and I think it's because she is a woman and she is good and she is black and she is young. Which is fuckin' disgusting. So there.\n\nFebruary 22, 2009\n\nwhat do you think?\n\nshould folks who cannot carry and bear children be able to vote on the abortion issue? why or why not?\u2013or to resist binarism, just feel free to not pick a side and say something in general. (personal note: i like to say no, they shouldn't. not that it would ever happen, but to be essentialist for a tiny minute, i think that men are worried about women having the power to decide to have the baby or not. do people who are not able to grow embryos and feti in their bodies not trust those who are able to do so?)\n\nNOTE: ultimately, to me, this isn't a men\/women issue; it's a who can bear and who can't issue. gender is socially defined, not biologically. sex is defined biologically. and sex is as fluid as gender (i love you, trannies!). some men can bear children, and some cannot\u2013same for women. some men would want to, and some wouldn't\u2013same for women. and yes, it does take an egg and a sperm to make an embryo. however, only one person's body actually carries the embryo and fetus and bears the infant.\n\ni'm not trying to rile y'all up. just wondering. secondary question: if only people who can carry children decided whether or not abortion was legal\/illegal\/etc., how would the issue and laws be affected? try not to be heteronormative and also try to re-think gender and sex. have fun!"}

{"text":"Post navigation\n\n90s Movie Review: Edward Scissorhands\n\nWhen it comes to 90s movies, there are many films that would seem too obscure to reach profitable popularity in any other decade, but in the 90s they produce a massive cult following. One of these films is Tim Burton's humble, lovable Edward Scissorhands.\n\nOur story begins in an old, lonely castle atop a menacing hill. It is there that an inventor lives, creating new devices and tinkering around with them. One day, he decides to create a man whom he decides to named Edward. The scientist is like a father figure to the creature, but dies before he is able to finish making Edward. Left alone, confused, and with scissors for hands, Edward isolates himself in a dark corner of the castle and watches the days pass by. It isn't until the super-friendly, motherly makeup saleswoman, Peg, discovers him that he is granted a new life. Peg pities Edward and decides to invite him into her home.\n\nHis scissor hands are not appreciated by everyone, though, and his eccentricities quickly become a barrier to friendship and acceptance. Through his own quiet, gentle, humble disposition, Edward eventually makes an impression on everyone he meets. Whether it be curiosity, anger, or fear, Edward is the talk of the neighborhood.\n\nUnfortunately, Edward's good nature leaves him open to be taken advantage of. His artistic use of his scissor hands is exploited and he is tricked into burglarizing a house by Peg's daughter and her asshole boyfriend. Edward's frustration and feelings of rejection make him shy away from society, and he also learns that he is unable to touch others without accidentally hurting them with his sharply-bladed fingers. The townspeople's curiosity and love toward him is replaced with fear and a desire to get rid of him.\n\nEdward Scissorhands is simultaneously a love story, a lesson in kindness, and a tale of rejection and estrangement. It's a tale about how a strange person, no matter how gentle and well-meaning, can enter a conformed society and shake things up beyond repair. It explores the reaches of human tolerance for someone who is different than them and how those who stray from the norm will be used and eventually rejected, damaging their inherent goodness. Despite all of the evil that exists around Edward in the form of deceit, gossip, jealousy, hypocrisy, and a lack of understanding, he remains vigilantly gentle and innocent.\n\nIt's definitely my favorite pairing of Johnny Depp with Tim Burton, and his performance as Edward is touching and believable. The lush, pastel beauty of the neighborhood landscape is well-contrasted to the dark, grey, gothic scenery of Edward's world. The irony exists in the fact that the lonely, isolated castle is a more comforting shelter from the pretty world outside where the evil truly exists. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect blend of the weird and the soft in much the same way the film is. While not always remembered as the most popular film Burton ever did, it is one of my favorites and certainly the most beautiful."}
{"text":"I'd like to be sitting in back of a theater to watch the reaction of a crowd suckered into \"Traitor\" by the TV ad's claim that it's an action thriller like the \"Bourne\" movies.\n\n\"Uhhh, how come there's so much prayin' to Allah and not much fightin'?\"\n\nNot even close to a \"Bourne\" flick, it's more like a \"Mohammed Brasco,\" about a devout Muslim demolitions expert who goes deep under cover to infiltrate a terrorist group. If there isn't already a cultural suspense genre, maybe this'll start it.\n\nDon Cheadle (\"Hotel Rwanda,\" \"Crash\") plays a Sudanese-born former U.S. Special Forces soldier named Samir Horn who has a talent for making things go boom. Caught making a deal with terrorists, he's thrown in a Yemeni prison where two things happen: He's interrogated by enlightened FBI agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and his old school smack-'em-around partner, Archer (Neal McDonough); and he becomes fast friends with a terrorist named Omar (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui), who helps him escape. (Omar would be the Al Pacino in \"Mohammed Brasco.\")\n\nIf \"Traitor\" is like a \"Bourne\" movie in any respect at all, it's the globe-trotting, as the cat-and-mouse game between Horn and Clayton takes them to locations around the world. Gradually proving his way into the terrorist group through different bombings that all seem to have some kind of hitch in them, Horn is really working for a CIA contractor (Jeff Daniels) aiming for the terrorist bigwig before a major symbolic attack in the U.S. heartland.\n\nAs the first big American blockbuster movie I can think of with a devout Muslim hero, it may take an adjustment for some, but that's not what makes \"Traitor\" difficult. Filmmakers seem to err on the side of overcautiousness whenever it comes to depicting Middle Eastern bad guys \u2014 and hey, I remember covering a protest for 1998's \"The Seige\" by people who hadn't even seen it. \"Traitor\" is a much smarter, nervier and more complex movie, but it's still too by-the-numbers and didactic. For instance, Agent Clayton is a Middle East expert and clearly the only one out of all worldwide law enforcement who seems able to find his own backside with both hands. Just too stock, especially in his awkward dialogue with the more ignorant Archer.\n\nNot all Muslims are jihadist nutcases? Hey, thanks!\n\nSome of the people who don't like Americans might actually have valid reasons? Oh, stop, you!\n\nHaving said that, it's still the Southern-accented Clayton whom I'd rather see in a spinoff, like Tommy Lee Jones' character in \"The Fugitive,\" because the filmmakers barely give up enough about the tormented Horn to make you want to stick with him. It's not the character's ambiguity \u2014 the choices he makes to stay undercover, let alone a problematic final act that's supposed to be heroic. It's that he's too much of a ghost, and even a talent like Cheadle's can't bring out material that isn't there.\n\nFirst-time director Jeffrey Nachmanoff, known for \"The Day After Tomorrow\" script, wrote the screenplay. Of all people, Steve Martin came up with the idea. It is neither wild nor crazy."}

Three boys are sitting in the sun-bleached field,\ndeconstructing an animated cartoon.\n\n\"First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette,\" one\nboy says in disgust, the gun falling forgotten to his side. \"Gargamel\ndid.

And as for the whole gang-bang scenario . . . it just couldn't\nhappen. Smurfs are asexual,\" he continues, as if this should\nall be common knowledge and the biology of Smurfs taught in every high school\nscience class. He finishes his speech to the chagrin of his squinting friends.\n\n\"Damn it, Donnie,\" one of the boys sighs. \"Why do you\ngotta get so smart on us?\"\n\nThe film is Donnie Darko, a cult favorite if there ever was one.\nMany a mind has developed migraines trying to interpret the dizzy gyrations\nof Donnie's journey through the Tangent Universe. Film students and\nInternet bloggers alike can philosophize for hours on the metaphor of a boy\nfollowing a dark rabbit down the eighteenth hole and the science of popping\nplacebos. Donnie Darko, as a cinematic experiment, just seems to\nask for interpretation.\n\nOr does it just ask what Sean\nSmith asks? Why do we have to get so smart?\n\nFollow the metaphor\n\nFilm is about communication\u2014but so is music. So is the Internet. So\nis homicide. Everyone has a message they want to get across, so it seems\nnatural for humans to interpret film as having deeper meanings. But maybe\nthat's not the real story. Maybe there's no message at all. Maybe\nfilm criticism is one more exercise in human egotism, and films we label\ngroundbreaking are simpler than we think.\n\nMuch of Donnie Darko's conflict takes place in Middlesex\nRidge School. The first real journey through those doors is taken in slow\nmotion, accompanied by the Tears For Fears ballad \"Head Over Heels.\" This\nis the fifth chapter on the DVD edition of the Donnie\nDarko director's cut, also titled \"Head Over Heels.\" The\nphrase seems out of place in a DVD full of chapters whose labels are rather\nstraightforward, such as \"Going Together,\" the segment in which\nGretchen agrees (if you can call it that) to be Donnie's girl and \"Inappropriate\nMethods,\" containing the firing of Karen Pomeroy.\n\nIt's just a song, right? Nondiagetic sound, as the film students would\nsay? Maybe not. A closer look at the lyrics reveals\nthat perhaps the film and the song share more than just an obsession with\ntime.\n\nStormy relationship\n\nI wanted to be with you alone, and talk about the weather\n\n\"A storm is coming. Frank says a storm is coming,\" Donnie intones\nin front of a class at Middlesex Ridge.\n\nThe phrase \"a storm is coming\" has long been used as a metaphor\nfor climactic events, both in film and in life. This meteorological metaphor\u2014meant\nto symbolize not the end of the world in general, but the end of Donnie's world\u2014is\nreferred to repeatedly during the course of the film. The poem is just the\nbeginning; later, in a therapy session (now there's a woman\nwho wouldn't get a message if it came up and bit her in the face),\na hypnotized Donnie sobs, \"The sky will open up.\"\n\nFinally, Roberta Sparrow, who has gone from being a scientific genius to\nthe insane Grandma Death, whispers what Donnie has always known: \"The\nstorm is coming.\"\n\nIndeed.\n\nA touching movie\n\nYou keep your distance with a system of touch and gentle persuasion.\nI'm lost in admiration\u2014could I need you this much?\nOh, you're wasting my time, you're just wasting time\n\nThe clumsy but oddly sweet romance between Donnie Darko and Gretchen Ross\nis handled well in the film\u2014\"well\" meaning \"subtly,\" of\ncourse. It can be argued that the most romantic scene in the entire film\nis Gretchen's refusal to kiss Donnie on the way home from school.\n\n\"I just want it to be at a time . . . at a time when . . .\" Gretchen\nfalters.\n\nDonnie finishes her thought for her: \"When it reminds you how beautiful\nthe world can be?\"\n\nGretchen frowns, her gaze darting to a clump of trees. \"Yeah. And\nright now there's some fat guy over there staring at us.\"\n\nIt takes Donnie and Gretchen nearly the entire film, in fact, to express\nphysical affection in any way, shape, or form. Their time together is quiet\u2014a\nhand held here, a brief kiss there, and yet the two characters form the strongest\nbond out of any two characters in the entire film\u2014except, perhaps,\nthe bond between Donnie and the dark rabbit of his nightmares.\n\nAmbitious\n\nI made a fire and watching it burn thought of your future\nWith one foot in the past now just how long will it last?\nNo, no, no. Have you no ambition?\n\n\"Donnie Darko,\" Gretchen muses on that first walk home from\nschool. \"What kind of a name is that? Sounds like a superhero.\"\n\nDonnie arches a brow. \"How do you know I'm not?\"\n\nIt's not so far from the truth. If Donnie's not a superhero,\nhe is most definitely an equal opportunity villain. Not satisfied with the\nflooding of the school, Donnie takes vandalism to a whole new level with\nthe burning of Jim Cunningham's house, graduating in a matter of minutes\nfrom disgruntled student to arsonist. The flames eating at Cunningham's\nportrait are nicely symbolic, but Donnie cares nothing for the metaphor he's\nunwittingly created, nor for the child pornography he accidentally exposes\nwith his crime. The deed is done\u2014fitting punishment for a man who thinks\nhimself fit to tell kids their own ambitions. \"No one knows what they\nwant to be when they grow up,\" Donnie laughs into the microphone at\nCunningham's question-and-answer session. \"I think you're\nthe Antichrist.\"\n\nChildhood memories\n\nOne line of the Tears For Fears song seems to have more significance in\nthe film than any others. During the \"Head Over Heels\" sequence\nof Donnie Darko, the lyrics are mixed so that the line \"with\none foot in the past, now just how long will it last?\" is certain\nto play during the scene (chronologically, it wouldn't have appeared\nin the sequence, which is too short to allow the entire song to play). One\ncan argue, naturally, that these lines are in keeping with the film's\nobsession with time. Donnie himself is the only character \"with one\nfoot in the past\" and the other in the future. His visions bring him\nto tears in his therapist's office, or light him with the smile of\nan angel as he promises social misfit Cherita Chen that someday everything\nwill be better for her.\n\nMy mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air and dreaming I'm\na doctor.\n\nDr. Spock could have taken a few pages out of the Darkos' book. Eddie\nand Rose Darko rarely express distress over Donnie's apparent mental\nmalaise, and when they do, it turns almost immediately into a joke. \"Our\nson just called me a bitch,\" Rose Darko laments in one of the opening\nscenes of the film. \"You're not a bitch,\" her husband soothes. \"You're\nbitchin', but you're not a bitch.\"\n\nLikewise, when Donnie is suspended for telling uptight teacher Kitty Farmer\nto \"forcibly insert the LifeLine card into her anus\" (not that\nthere would be any room due to the stick already firmly in place there),\nthe Darkos are less than perturbed. Rose Darko's comment, \"I\nthink that telling any woman to forcibly insert a book into her anus is an\naction that should have consequences,\" sounds very rehearsed, as though\nshe knows a camera is trained on her and is recording her words.\n\n\"I think we should buy him a moped,\" is Eddie Darko's\nanswer.\n\n\"I think we should get a divorce,\" Rose responds.\n\nThen both collapse into laughter.\n\nBut it is Rose Darko who has the final say on the parenting front. When\nDonnie asks her, \"How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?\" she\nanswers with a tearful smile, \"Wonderful.\"\n\nIt's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand.\n\nIt's nicely ironic that Donnie deconstructs the Smurfs while shooting\nbottles in a field. \"What's the point of living if you don't\nhave a dick?\" he asks his friends with a shrug. The answer is he doesn't\nneed one\u2014he has the gun. And while he spills his secrets to his therapist\nboth voluntarily and under hypnosis, the one thing he keeps from her is the\npistol he finds in his parents' bedroom. It is never explained why\nthe Darkos have the gun or how it makes the journey to Roberta Sparrow's\ncellar on that last fateful night, but even Donnie, advocate of truth that\nhe is, keeps that piece a secret.\n\nYes, that is a gun in his pocket, and he's not happy to see you.\n\nAnd this is my four leaf clover\nI'm on the line, one open mind\n\nOne open mind.\n\nMaybe that is the whole point. Donnie Darko, the Living Receiver, the visionary\nwho saw that fateful storm coming. Throughout the film, only Donnie argues\nagainst the status quo\u2014at Jim Cunningham's seminar, during Kitty\nFarmer's LifeLine exercise, in Karen Pomeroy's English class.\nEven Donnie's beloved Gretchen works against him in their duel over\nthe point of Watership Down. \"You're missing the point,\" Gretchen\nsays. But Donnie's argument is quite simple\u2014there is no point\nto miss.\n\nWhile discussing time travel with teacher Kenneth Monnitoff, Donnie's\nopen mind is busy figuring out ways to apply Roberta Sparrow's theories.\nHowever, Monnittoff stops the conversation with the admission, \"I can't\ncontinue.

{"text":"von Trier Again\n\nPseudo Reviews\n\nLars von fucking Trier!!!! I think I've now recommended 3 films by\nthis mad genius. I'm afraid I have to make it 4. If you haven't seen\nat least one of my previous von Trier recommendations yet (BREAKING\nTHE WAVES, THE KINGDOM, THE IDIOTS), then fucking blow me! To those\nof you who enjoy seeing magnificent filmmaking, here's another film\nfor you to check out. It's the only one I'm recommending this issue\nbecause it's just that good.\n\nZENTROPA (a.k.a. EUROPA)\n\nThis movie is all about style. I don't think I've seen a movie, quite\nthis stylized before. It's pure eye candy. I'd rather not tell you\nabout the techniques employed in case some of you can't tell what's\ngoing on in the film technically. If you don't well you're soooo damn\nlucky. I was giddy because of it, but it would be fucking stunning to\njust watch the film, and not knowing for sure, what's being done.\n\nThe basic plot of the film, is an American of German decent, goes to\nGermany in 1945. There his uncle has lined him up a job as the\nconductor of a sleeping car, on a train. On his first day, he meets a\nwoman, who later invites him to her family's house for dinner. The\nfamily is of high class, and eventually he gets mixed up in their\npolitics and terrorism.\n\nIt's just an amazing, beautiful, and downright cool film.\n\nYou should be able to find it pretty easily, since it was released on\nvideo by Touchstone. Why the domestic laserdisc isn't letterboxed, is\nbeyond me. We (When I say `We', I mean, `I' until I've got some other\npeople on my side) can only hope that they'll release it on DVD in the\nnear future.\n\nJeff thinks that since Kubrick is gone, that von Trier should take his place in that joke about God thinking He's Kubrick"}

The stories of his uncle chronicled a man who left Yugoslavia to seemingly became the king of the common man in 1970s West Berlin. Dragan's disco-era world was filled with strippers, champagne and a crime racket with guys known as The Crow and The Baker. Over three decades later, Vuk decides to seek out his uncle. In place of the hedonistic playboy, he finds an aging bordello security guard longing for the days before the Wall came down. Soon Vuk becomes directly entangled with Dragan's skewed world, where doing street-side bordello promotion is a hard day's work, smuggling jackets is a perfectly logical way to make quick cash and political correctness is never a priority.

{"text":"Winner of the Cannes Grand Prix, Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan's (Uzak, Three Monkeys) new film has been hailed as a masterpiece. An epic tale, it follows one night and day in a murder investigation; as police grimly disinter a buried body from the Anatolian steppes. As the corpse is uncovered, so are long-buried memories in the minds of the lawmen. It sounds simple, but Ceylan enriches it with so many rich meditations, it feels like a novel."}
{"text":"... posters,\nbut in posters that employ the skills of artists. Naturally this bias is\nweighed heavily towards materials produced from the 1950's to the late 1980 bo... boys to fill a neverending void. Made in 1983, \u00c0 nos amours is considered as one of Maurice Pialat's masterworks with L'enfance nue and Van Gogh. Its subject, sex with a multitude of partners in the world of young adults is still an important one and as of nowadays teenagers seem to start having sex in a younger age than ever before. Pialat's objective camera works like a documentary observer that captures the life of a family that is torn from inside. The love between the father and the daughter, the love\/hate relationship of Suzanne with her mother and the older brother that is involved despite his disgust for all of this. What strikes most is how it is much more than just the story of a young woman who gets to sleep with many young men. It is about a family, the most universal human cell and how when they don't get along anymore everyone is involved and gets collateral damages. It is also correct to believe that Pialat who always used his live as an inspiration might have made a representation of the impotency of the nuclear family. As he portrays the father of the family it is easier to associate him as one of the authors.His main strenght as a storyteller is to present events and scenes without any introduction or narrative manipulation. He doesn't need to explain his story, the story explains itself as it goes along. He takes for granted that his audience is smart enough to understand the meanings of the images they are watching. As mentioned earlier in this review, the documentary feel of the whole thing is elevated by the naturalistic performances of the actors and the improvised like dialogues. This is a mastered film and a stronger effort than L'enfance nue, it is more a whole than a patchwork of different scenes and it flows much better as a plot. When someone thinks about French films of the 1960's and the French directors that starter in this era we tend to link them with the Nouvelle Vague or French New Wave if you prefer. In the case of Pialat, he was not a part of it since his first film was released too late and even if it was produced by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Pialat never really was a part of this group. He even didn't really liked the band of the Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma and he minimized the influence of the bunch of the Nouvelle Vague. Having myself been a huge fan of the Nouvelle Vague, I find it very refreshing to discover films from directors thqat didn't really cared for them. \u00c0 nos amours has strinking performances for its actors especially the young Sandrine Bonnaire who makes a superb Suzanne that seems to be lost in this difficult age. This is, however, a very subtle film that may or may not charm its viewer just like a Eric Rohmer film where much is said and little is done. Well, here much is said and done but not much is really explain on the motifs and causes of the events. I would recommend this film for French film lovers and people who like films with a content that is not chewed already. alway... always, win in Rugby, which outside of North America is a really big deal. But. You love horror movies. And aside from a few enormous standouts from the past couple decades the NZ isn't really known as a hotbed of horror production. But you got this really awesome idea for a horror film and wish someone would just give you a bag of money to make it. Well, it turns out ABCs of Death producer Ant Timpson has a bag...\n[Read the whole post on twitchfilm.com...]"}

{"text":"Parents say\n\nKids say\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nParents need to know that this black-and-white, 1940s-style \"film noir\" isn't likely to appeal to kids. Its plot includes references to Nazis, war crimes, and the atomic bomb, as well as lots of strong language and violence (beyond what typified the era). Characters frequently say \"f--k\"; there's also one use of \"c--t\" and an anti-Semitic remark. Violence includes beating, kicking, and shooting (resulting in bloody wounds). Sexual imagery includes a woman stripping, a rough sexual act (the woman's figure and face are in shadow), and some kissing. Several references are made to Lena's work as a prostitute. Characters smoke incessantly (it's 1945) and drink like fish.\n\nAn explicit sexual act (woman in shadows on bed, man has sex from behind her); Hannelore performs feather\/strip dance in club (shadowy); Hannelore strips to her underwear and invites Jake to have sex with her (using explicit language); Hannelore and Lena work as prostitutes (discussed frequently).\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nIn 1945 Germany, reporter Capt. Jake Gesimar (George Clooney) arrives in Germany to cover the Potsdam Peace Conference. He immediately clashes with his younger driver, Corporal Tully (Tobey Maguire). Where Jake is principled, if cynical, Tully is at once na\u00efve and slick, and involved in criminal activities. The men's differences come to a head over a prostitute named Lena (Cate Blanchett) who's currently Tully's girlfriend and was formerly Jake's lover. Soon Jake is embroiled in a murder case involving the insidious Russian General Sikorsky (Ravil Isaynov) and covered up by crafty U.S. Colonel Muller (Beau Bridges). Jack is helped and stymied by Congressman Breimer (Jack Thompson) and war crimes prosecutor Bernie Teitel (Leland Orser). Bernie is an old friend of Jake's and doesn't trust him, but is invested enough in tracking down the now-scurrying-away Nazis that he makes deals with whomever will help him do it, be it Jake or the U.S. military.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nThe Good German is Steven Soderbergh's latest expansion of stylistic and thematic boundaries. Shot in black and white, the movie focuses on the moral and political dilemmas emerging from the Potsdam Peace Conference, where, an epigraph asserts, Harry Truman, Winston Churchill, and Josef Stalin gathered to \"draw the postwar map.\"\n\nLena and Jake's passionate past -- as well as a scene at a rainy airport -- evokes Rick and Ilsa in Casablanca. But Jake's efforts to do the right thing are repeatedly complicated by others' greed and desire for vengeance. This thoughtful, complex film ends with a Stars & Stripes headline announcing that the United States has just dropped the atomic bomb on Japan. Even as WWII comes to a horrific end, the Cold War is already in motion attempts to mimic 1940s style and culture. How is the era presented differently in this movie than in films actually from that time period? How does the movie's explicit language and violent imagery alter your idea of what 1944 might have been like? How do Lena and Jake form a romantic couple that is at once old-fashioned (sentimental, nostalgic) and like those in present-day movies (cynical, passionate)?"}
{"text":"Categories\n\nCheck out the Archives\n\nOf Interest\u2026\n\nAwards & Nominations\n\nI am torn. Savages feels as if Oliver Stone somehow found a way to stream his thoughts on celluloid for the world to devour at their leisure. It's bright, vibrant, random, illogical, contrary, obtuse, surreal and visceral \u2013 often all at the same time. It's far too uneven to earn an unqualified recommendation, as it's a disorienting mess of a film at the best of times. However, it's also consistently interesting, a strangely compelling. Savagesmight be too all over the map to ever be consistently great (or even good), but it is never boring.\n\nThat's a savage mask!\n\nSavages barely hangs together as a narrative film. In fact, that's where the bulk of the flaws lie. The characters are painfully over-written and the plot depends far too much on double-cross and intrigue for its own good. In many respects, Savages feels overloaded, a little too packed with characters and conspiracies to really fit within the confines of a two-hour film, without seeming fit to explode at any given minute. The story itself seems at odds with Stone's style and technique, and the two never really find a way to co-exist. It seems like they are constantly at war with one another.\n\nYou know there's a problem with a film like this when you sympathise more with the bloodthirsty, torturing, raping, killing and necklacing Mexican drug cartel over the three kids selling dope to sick people. Our lead trio are played by a bunch of young actors to varying degrees of success, but they're the root of the film's problems. These are three cardboard cut-out archetypes. There's the pacifist. There's the hothead. There's the girl with messed up issues. These aren't any more complicated than the archetypes you'd find in a disposable slasher film.\n\nYep, so it's a bit like The Hangover\u2026 except, you know, with more brutal murder and torture and less monkeys\u2026\n\nIn a way, their shallowness kinda works with rapid-fire stream of thought style Stone brings to the film. The problem is that the script resists it. The script over-compensates for their shallowness, giving us awkward philosophical tracts and seemingly endless narration in an attempt to build character. \"You don't change the world,\" the hothead tells the pacifist. \"The world changes you.\" Deep, man. Our narrator goes on and on about how great the three of them are and how they've got their stuff together, and how they're fundamentally decent people.\n\nThe only problem is that dialogue is terrible, and Blake Lively can't make it work. \"I have orgasms,\" she explains at one point. \"Chon has war-gasms.\" It's supposed to be smart, but it's just terrible, as if you're waiting for a shot of her firing imaginary guns at the camera while winking. But she's too busy \"$%#!ing the war out of him\", her own radical post-traumatic stress counselling technique. The movie demonstrates it's working wonders. She talks about the pacifist, telling us his philosophy is \"Buddhist\", while also assuring us that the hothead's philosophy is \"baddest.\"\n\nI can only imagine what the first draft looked like\u2026\n\nIt's the type of faux!deep nonsense that you get when an intelligent writer tries to use a less literate character to deliver a philosophical point they feel strongly about. It's an attempt to couch a statement in a way that feels like it could organically come from that kind of person \u2013 it's blending Eastern philosophy with valley girl chic, and it's often quite terrible. It gets so bad that the audience doesn't even care about these three people caught in a war with the big and ominous cartel.\n\nAfter all, the gangsters might be shallow archetypes, but at least they're honest about it. Stone wisely surrounds his young leads with more competent elder actors, and its these cast members who turn in the best performances. Salma Hayek's Elena is perhaps the most compelling and engaging character in the movie. She's no more complex or sophisticated than the leads, but she gets massive points for rather brilliantly exposing just how incredibly shallow the trio are. She gets the single best line in the script, and it's one that the movie might have been a bit wiser to pay more heed to, bu the movie instead struggles against her astute observation and trying to convince us that the three leads are actual more than just a bunch of entitled stereotypes.\n\nIt's a common misconception that bad guys twirl their moustaches. Del Toro knows that real villains stroke their moustaches.\n\nBenicio Del Toro plays the effective villain of the piece, who literally spends most of his screentime stroking his moustache and demonstrating that Tom Hardy hasn't quite cornered the market on intense accented characters. Del Toro's enforcer is almost ridiculously one-dimensionally evil, but the actor pitches his performance perfectly. This man is a violent and aggressive psychopath, a misogynist, a bully, a murderer and torturer. He couldn't exude any more evil if he tried. Del Toro embraces the archetype, and produces a fascinating and compelling performance.\n\nDemi\u00e1n Bichir has a nice small role as a cartel right-hand man, and John Travolta makes the most of a relatively tiny role as a DEA agent who has one priority alone: looking out for himself. These elder veterans do a much better job than Lively, Taylor or Kitsch. They seem to realise that they're trapped inside something resembling a fevered dream, and embrace the elegant simplicity of their characters. While the script frantically pads these characters with monologues designed to craft the illusion of depth, the older actors are smart enough to accept that less is more, and to embrace the archetypes they inhabit, rather than struggling against them.\n\nGrease is the word\u2026 to describe what they're doing to the wheels of justice\u2026\n\nAnd yet, despite these fundamental problems, there's something strangely hypnotic about the way Stone constructs the film. Lots of quick shots and ambient music. Occasionally he'll switch filters or go for a weird close-up, or give us a nature shot, or a montage. He brutally juxtaposes the images on-screen and the soundtrack, setting a cartel execution to classical music, and keeping the score going as he transitions effortless to a shopping excursion.\n\nThere's a wonderful energy all this, and it often seems like the movie is tripping over itself, as if it has so ethereal and quality that it can barely get ahold of itself. It's occasionally frustrating, but it's also strangely engaging. At one point, towards the end, Stone even gives himself a \"do over\", as if literally editing the movie as we watch it. He decides that a certain scene doesn't work, so he goes back and does it again, from a different angle, with a tweaked outcome.\n\nIt's her way or the Hayek way\u2026\n\nOf course it's all painstakingly scripted, but Stone does it with enough skill that the audience doesn't know whether to be excited or appalled by his boldness. It seems as if Stone's subconscious was chewing away on a movie about drug dealers, and his subconscious just sorta coughed the whole thing up in one chunk for his conscious mind (and ours) to parse. There are times when the movie seems to abandon its narrative, plotting and characters, and just becomes this melting pot of images, music and ideas. These are probably the strongest moments of the film \u2013 as Stone often feels trapped by the paint-by-numbers plotting and the shallow characters.\n\nWatching the film, it seems almost as if Stone is discovering the film as we are. That works! That doesn't work! Okay, but what if\u2013? Hm, that was good, but then\u2013? It's an experience that is compelling, but also feels a little reckless. It's rather unlike most films, and it takes a while to adapt to it. If you can let yourself get swept along, there are more than a few lovely moments to be found, surreal diamonds in the rough, like fragments of a barely-remembered dream. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to discover Stone had imagined the whole thing one night after reading the book, almost exactly as it turned out on screen.\n\nI want some of what Stone was smoking..\n\nUnfortunately, Savages isn't nearly consistent enough to stand up to that sort of scrutiny. Stone's style is fascinating, but the content itself is far too mundane to really suit it. It's a hard film to wrap my head around. Truth be told, I am still trying to sort out precisely how I feel about it. It's not a great film, and I'm not even sure I'd argue it's strong enough to be a good film. But it is an interesting film, and one that will contain a few mercurial moments for a suitably open mind. The problem is that those diamonds are buried with an awful lot of coal."}
{"text":"This Swedish film is strongly rooted in comic books and video games, though it truly bears little resemblance to either medium. What opens with the promise of being an action film filled with bloody street brawls, turns out to be more of an examination of one man's inability to feel (both emotionally and in a tactile capacity).\n\nDonny, more commonly known as DD, is a hapless, pot smoking lay about, who is too cheap and lazy to even get himself laid. By chance (or so it seems), DD is given a mysterious white box by a woman named Lova, who claims the box is the key to \"everything.\" As it turns out, Lova may also be an immortal and a fictional character\u2014 the star of comic books and video games, Storm. The DVD synopsis says that they travel through time in a battle of good vs. evil, but I'm not sure that's entirely accurate. What it boils down to is that there are a group of bald maniacs led by a man with a scar, who wants to keep DD from remembering some suppressed childhood memory. Personally, I don't see revisiting memories as time travel. It makes little sense when you're watching it, but the film has a great sense of humor, softening up the audience with an Amelie-style introduction from DD.\n\nThe synopsis also compares the film to The Matrix, which is really unfair to Storm. The two films are nothing alike, and Storm, with its virtually unexplained, complicated storyline, is far more intelligent than the Wachowskis' action-fest. And as I hinted at before, there is very little fighting, though the film opens with Lova beating the maniacs with a bike chain. But there is one incredible action sequence, which harkens less to The Matrix than to comic books in general, where DD is reading a comic book about Storm. The sequence begins in animation and dissolves into live action, with Eva Rose (who plays Lova) as Storm, maneuvering her way through a series of laser trips and kicking some bald maniac ass.\n\nOverall, Storm may be a little off-putting to some viewers with its vague storyline and sporadic periods of more introspective down time, but it is definitely worth a watch for those who enjoy more experimental cinema."}
{"text":"Drug dealers do drive cars like this. And so do cops, garbage men, Philadelphia Eagles linebackers and barbers.

Given that it's another unholy blend of doc footage and artificial storytelling, Tulpan looks for all the world like a second go of the overrated The Story of the Weeping Camel. But there's one secret ingredient longtime documentarian Sergei Dvortsevoy has added: humor. That seems to have done the trick, as this Cannes favorite is, rather than a National Geographic snore, an irresistible mix of ethnography porn and deadpan silliness often worthy of its obvious inspiration, Werner Herzog.\n\nOn the surface is a story that would've pleased Yasujiro Ozu.

{"text":"Gigola\n\nHaving spent much of her life as a controversial author, Gigola is Laure Charpentier's directorial debut.\n\nSet in the underbelly of (literally) Gay Paris, the film tells the story of George (Lou Doillon), a young woman who dresses as a man and hires herself and her services out to the lonely, undersexed women of the Parisian aristocracy. With its setting within this little known subculture and her emphasis on authenticity, it's lucky that Charpentier is familiar with the source material. In 1972, she wrote the semi-autobiographical novel, Gigola. Upon its publication the book caused uproar, and was hastily banned by critics. The ban wasn't lifted for 30 years. Whether it was the lesbian sex scenes or the blatant challenges to gender stereotypes, Gigola rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. However, with her movie, Charpentier looks likely to reclaim that audience. The film is dripping with affection for 60s Parisian nightlife, though often seedy and sometimes dangerous, Gigola is full of fascinating and exuberant characters. From the dragged-up cabaret singers to the unhinged prostitutes George pimps out, it feels shady fairytale.\n\ni-D online spoke to Charpentier about the Paris she remembers, and George's place in today's more liberated society.\n\nGigola feels like a love letter to the Paris of the 60s. Why do you love the city? What is it that makes you fall in love? Because I'm Parisian. Because I love Paris. It's my town. France is my country of course, but when I go away for long periods travelling, and then come back to Paris I say \"Ahh, my Paris.\" So it's that sort of love.\n\nSo you still live there? Yes, it would be impossible to live anywhere else.\n\nHow do you feel about Paris today? Are its best days behind it? It's not the same Paris. My Paris had 'the nights'. These have finished for me, partly because I'm too old [laughs], but also because it is impossible to find the same places I loved, they've all shut.\n\nWas part of the appeal of the gay club scene back then, the fact that it was so secretive? I think maybe it was a secret, yes, but it was also the money, there was much more money. In the cabaret, it was champagne, always. Champagne, champagne, champagne, now it's Coca-Cola. We'd spend all night in a nightclub, but it's finished. The champagne, the dress code, it's all gone. Now it's ripped jeans everywhere. It's not sexy, it's not interesting. I prefer a woman in a long dress, with jewels and diamonds and traditions. And in gay places, there is no more glamour.\n\nThe clothes in the film are incredibls, planned down to the tiniest detail. What sort of hand did you have in that side? I chose everything, all the clothes. I described everything so it was very easy for the wardrobe boys. They'd say \"Do you like this?\" \"Is this the right colour?\" and they'd ask for validation for everything of course.\n\nThe film is interspersed with cabaret performances, like narrations getting the viewer up to speed with the story. What purpose did you want the songs and the music to serve? It was the music of the 60s. We danced to it. It was wonderfully slow. I would have liked to have Le Petit Fleur but it was impossible. It was very expensive. I wanted dressage girls too.\n\nWhen the book was first released, it was banned. What was it that upset the censors? It was forbidden because there is the gay scene with the cane, and erotic scenes between women. In 1972 it was very difficult to speak about these subjects, they were very taboo. But later, the censor [who banned it] retired, so it was possible to publish it again. But for me it was not important if it got published or not. Either way, it got a quiet reception, as it was my first book.\n\nHow did writing it compare to directing it? Two adventures. This is my first film and it was my first book. It's one adventure writing and another directing. Originally I didn't want to direct the film but the producer said, \"Either it's you or it's finished\" So I say \"No, Gigola can't die.\" So I tried to direct it. We had eight directors before me, it was very difficult. Mainly because the men wanted to put their fantasies on mine it was impossible to do. A man is not a woman.\n\nWould you say you've got a taste for directing now? Are you looking to do more? I hope so. I have another two projects. One is in London. One is about the paparazzi, and the other is about the 'butches'. I saw many in London and I was very inspired."}

Director Breck Eisner (son of Disney's\nMichael Eisner) infuses the film with a roguish, devil-may-care, serial feel\nso familiar to fans of\nNational\nTreasure and Indiana Jones, but\nit's a tone true to the story and likely to draw in viewers.\n\nEisner uses style to over come a failing script in scenes like the title\nsequence where we scan across a room and learn everything we need to know\nabout Dirk. He uses great music as Dirk's boat heads up river, lots of stuff\nblowing up in dramatic fashion and well timed comic relief to keep us further\ninterested. Even though Sahara employs\none of my most hated movie clich\u00e9s (the lead actor performing some\ntask like surfing or skateboarding in a transparent and desperate attempt\nto look cool and appeal to \"the kids\"), even though it is hard to believe\na Civil War-era Confederate ship could make it across the Atlantic Ocean\nwith a load of heavy gold coins, and even though the politically correct\nand sensitive among ticket buyers will be put off by the portrayal of Mali\nnatives, Sahara has a certain charm.\nIt's fun to let go and ride along with this crazy cast on an unbelievable\nadventure.\n\nMcConaughey is a silly, likable guy, the kind of dude who could be your buddy\nif it wasn't for that whole getting arrested while playing the bongos naked\nthing (a guy has to have standards when picking friends). He makes Dirk Pitt\nsuave with the ladies like Bond, tough as nails like Rambo, and just as\nresourceful as MacGyver. At times, it gets to be a bit too much as he and\nEva too easily and luckily stumble across the right information, but McConaughey\nis charming and gives Pitt so much life, you enjoy watching it. He shares\ngreat chemistry with Steve Zahn as the two provide plenty of laughs, and\ndoes what he can with an underdeveloped, unnecessary love story.\n\nEisner doesn't always do a good job giving us a sense of time in this movie\n(Dirk and team hike across the desert so fast, they seem to be traveling\nfaster on foot than another character racing along all night long to catch\nthem in his car), and the team of 4 writers (basing the movie on Clive Cussler's\nnovel) don't do anything original, especially with the basic dialogue, but\nSahara is a passable, likable film."}
{"text":"127 Hours\n\nA young adventurer is navigating a crevice between two mountains of rock. He steps on the wrong thing, falls about 20 feet, and ends up with his right arm crushed underneath a boulder. He can't get out. No matter what he does, he is stuck. No one knows where he is, no one can hear him scream - there's probably not a soul around for many miles. All at once, his life expectancy is less than a week. He's going to run out of water and die.\n\nIn \"127 Hours,\" director Danny Boyle (\"Slumdog Millionaire\") tells the amazing true story of Aron Ralston, who didn't die but rather lived to write his memoirs ... with his left hand. How he got out is a matter of public record and is something virtually everyone will know going in, but knowing doesn't enhance the experience of the movie. It makes it even more excruciating. \"127 Hours,\" about an unimaginably unbearable experience, is pretty much an unbearable experience of its own. And yet, it must be said, it's exceptionally well made.\n\nBoyle takes a situation that's almost impossible to make cinematic: For about an hour of screen time, maybe more, James Franco as Aron is stuck under a rock. Aron wants to be any place but there, and so do we. Aron can't leave the rock, but we can easily get up and leave the theater. So Boyle employs memory sequences, fantasy sequences, breathtaking images of nature and perhaps a dozen shots so imaginatively conceived and framed that one can't help but feel awe at Boyle's visual mastery.\n\nThe problem is that \"127 Hours\" has the feeling of a film conceived for that very purpose, to be so static and lacking in narrative movement that there's nothing to notice but the director's flair. Boyle more or less keeps the enterprise from sinking, and yet for all his exertions, \"127 Hours\" is not exactly enjoyable. It's an ordeal for Aron and for the audience, too. Nor is the suffering worth it. The film does not have anything near a psychological or philosophical depth on a par with its visual inspiration.\n\nIt's just a story about a bad thing that happened to a happy-go-lucky goofball. He's an idiot when he gets stuck under the rock, but by the time he gets out, he's not an idiot anymore. He's not a hero, either, but he's tough as rock and has the guts of 10 men. This comes through in Franco's performance, but in a muted way, because he's not really Boyle's focus. Boyle's focus is his own virtuosity.\n\n\"127 Hours\" is sometimes agony to sit through, sometimes dull to sit through, and some shots so gruesome, so gory and horrifying, that many viewers will never see them. They'll avert their eyes. Still, hardly 10 minutes ever go by without Boyle showing us something extraordinary. Sometimes it's a shot of the sun breaking into the crevice and warming the rocks. In another case, it's an extended fantasy sequence, in which cascades of water rescue Aron, and he shows up at an ex-girlfriend's door, begging for help.\n\nBoyle does something remarkable with sound. Two or three times, when Aron experiences blinding, shrieking, inconceivable pain, Boyle shocks the audience with a loud, electric-buzzing sound that, in its harshness and suddenness - in the way it overwhelmingly becomes the only thing in the room - becomes a sonic analogue for pain. It's an impressive effect. When he's in pain, so are you.\n\nSo \"127 Hours\" is the work of a very talented person. But I can't imagine I'd have endured more than 30 minutes of it, were it not all in a day's work.\n\n-- Advisory: This film contains strong language - if a boulder fell on you, you wouldn't just say, \"Oh, fiddlesticks!\" - and horrible, disgusting, disturbing scenes of gore and terror.\n\nHow he got out is a matter of public record and is something virtually everyone will know going in, but knowing doesn't enhance the experience of the movie.\nBoyle takes a situation that's almost impossible to make cinematic:\n[...] Boyle employs memory sequences, fantasy sequences, breathtaking..."}
{"text":"Under London\n\nDirty Pretty Things (rated R for sexual content, disturbing images, and bad language) is a gritty thriller set among struggling immigrants in London. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Okwe, a Nigerian illegal holding down two demanding jobs-he's a cabbie during the day and a hotel desk clerk at night.\n\nWhen Okwe finds time for sleep, it's on a couch in a small, dingy flat rented by Senay (Amelie's Audrey Tautou), a Turkish immigrant working illegally at the same hotel. There are seeds of a friendship-and perhaps more-between the two, but they work opposite shifts, so their paths cross only briefly each day. This routine is interrupted by an alarming, exceedingly unpleasant discovery in the hotel's plumbing. Okwe soon learns that a black-market industry hides beneath the surface of the well-appointed London hotel.\n\nThe movie realistically, sometimes graphically, portrays immigrant life. Okwe and Senay's illegal status makes them easy prey, but it's interesting to note that their abusers are primarily other immigrants who have reached some position of authority. Dirty Pretty Things exists in a London unseen by most, with the film avoiding shots of Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, or anything else that might show up on a postcard.\n\nDirty Pretty Things deserves a strong R. The more brutal images in the film, although almost never explicit, are still disturbing. Even what is implied is often hard to take, particularly as Senay faces sexual abuse by several employers. But the best scenes in the film show Okwe, by contrast, exhibiting a quiet resolve, intelligence, and compassion that guide him through this grimy underworld."}

{"text":"Main menu\n\nJe tu il elle (I, You, He, She) \u2026 A lesson in what not to show\n\nAn early subtext masterpiece by CHANTAL AKERMAN\n\nFor me a good film maker knows exactly what to show an audience, but a great film maker knows what not to show them.\n\nGiving an audience information through film is a great craft but implying information is a much greater cinematic feat.\n\n(I'm not going into the title, so many people have gone over this already. If you are interested in it click here)\n\nAs soon as the film begins the mysterious protagonist states she has left somewhere and now lives in a spacious house. We are given little to no information in relation to where it is she has left or whom she has left from. All we know is in this new house that she continuously tries to redecorate, move furniture and \"express\" herself through letters has left her lost and lonely.\n\nHer original three page letter suddenly becomes six pages and more. She is finding it hard to express whatever it is she is feeling.\n\nShe takes off her clothes (not worrying if people can see her from outside) sometimes she glances out the window to stare at whatever is going on. We as the audience only ever see the house, everything that happens outside is only heard and she is the only person who sees that information. This shows the film is not trying to see things through the protagonist's eyes but simply observe her anthropologically and unsympathetically.\n\nEventually she goes exploring and runs into a truck driver who she seems to be attracted to, they drive around in the twilight, eat food and drink at his local bar. There is one moment of slight sexual interaction but there is a feeling that she is not fully interested in him sexually.\n\nThere is a scene where he talks of his family and his tedious job in an almost interview like set up\n\nShe eventually turns up at the door of a pretty girl, there seems to be chemistry between them, but also a feeling that they should not be there together. The young woman she has visited says simply \"I don't want you to stay\", however the playful compatibility between them over powers it. What happened between them? Why are they not allowed to be together? Is it information we need to know? Personally I don't think so. The young girl she has visited could have a husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, strict family, maybe the protagonist was abusive\u2026 it could be anything but that is not important, what is important is they both have chemistry and history, but they cannot be together.\n\nThe young woman makes food for the protagonist (after she almost arrogantly states \"I'm hungry\") this gives off the sense that the young woman is easily over powered and submissive to her.\n\nThere is a scene where the protagonist unbuttons the girls dress; the girl shakes her head in protest but soon folds to temptation. A lengthy real time sex scene begins where despite it's explicitly, it continues to show the attuned nature of the couple both physically and emotionally.\n\nAfter they have sex the protagonist leaves the bedroom whilst the young girl is still asleep.\n\nA whole complex relationship and the effects it has on the people involved is implied but never told. We are never aware of certain events or background information, only the subtle gestures of human interaction and presence."}
{"text":"Epic, breathtaking, overblown, and yet achingly small when it needs to be, TITANIC is both an emotional and technical masterpiece. James Cameron's film is the grandest of cinematic spectacles, artfully blending romance and tragedy in such a way that makes the smallest and largest moments resonate with a deep emotional power. TITANIC is not a complex story, yet the simplicity of the trapped rich girl and hopeful poor boy falling in love aboard the world's most famous ship makes their love story even grander as it is set in the context of the legendary disaster that awaits the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nI fully and readily admit that I am utterly in the bag for this movie. Even when it was released back in 1997 and I was in full-blown elitist snark, \"everything sucks\" mode I was moved by this very simple, yet sweeping love story set aboard a massive spectacle. For me, James Cameron has only made two masterpieces, and this is one of them. (Aliens is the other.) Perhaps because these characters are so simple and set against such an important historical moment, they gain a timeless quality that sustains this movie.\n\nCameron's style of directing TITANIC is to continually contrast the smallness of people with the grandness of the ship, or the importance of a small moment in the context of the ship's sinking, and in doing so he elevates the cinematic impact of both. For the people aboard the vessel, every emotion they have takes on greater importance, while the ship itself is constantly represented as a massive leviathan, complete with towering stacks and endless labyrinthine corridors.\n\nWhat works most for me about TITANIC is that Cameron is constantly offering us these intimate moments between characters, and that continually drives home the idea to embrace every moment of your life because (clumsy Cameron metaphor coming in 3 \u2026 2 \u2026) you never know when you're going to run into an iceberg and run out of the possibility of moments.\n\nIt's Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber), the Titanic's shipbuilder, standing alone in front of a clock in the first class smoking room as his ship \u2013 his ship \u2013 is falling apart and sinking. His lament to Rose that, \"I'm sorry I couldn't build you a better ship,\" reveals that he's putting the weight of this entire disaster on his own shoulders.\n\nIt's Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), so full of vinegar throughout the film, being deflated by the unwillingness of anyone else in her lifeboat to go back and look for survivors.\n\nIt's the old couple holding each other in bed as water is swamping the ship.\n\nAnd the moment that, for some reason, hits me hardest: at the end of the film, when Rose is standing alone on the deck of the Carpathia and Cameron gives us a perspective shot looking up at the towering Statue of Liberty. Why this moment resonates stronger than the other moments in the film is nothing I've ever really been able to explain. I think it has something to do with the promise embodied in that Statue of America being the land of new beginnings. From Rose's perspective, this is a return to the United States for Rose, but it's not with the sense of entrapment she felt at the start of the voyage. Where she was saddened and crushed by being able to see her whole life as Cal's wife laid out before her, she now has complete freedom to live whatever life she chooses to live. Lady Liberty is once again a beacon of possibility instead of oppression. There's a stoic strength to the Statue, too, and Cameron uses the brief appearance to symbolize hope, strength, new beginnings, and safety.\n\nIs TITANIC a manipulative story?\n\nDamn straight it is, but isn't that why we go to the movies \u2026 to be manipulated? Don't hate because Cameron writes that manipulation large. The same goes for the film's adherence to history \u2013 I don't need my movies to be 100% historically accurate (though it's nice if they are), so Cameron's altered depiction of Molly Brown is unfortunate, but not a deal breaker. What I want is for movies to be 100% engaging, and TITANIC is definitely that.\n\nCameron contrasts the tragedy of the ship's narrative with the uplift of the love story. We know the ship is going to eventually sink and we know Jack and Rose are going to fall in love, and the two arcs intersect each other at the moment the Titanic hits the iceberg and ruptures its hull. Both DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic throughout the film. Cameron writes simple characters, of course, but again, I think this ends up being to the film's advantage, as Cameron encourages you to experience this movie instead of thinking about it. Simple characters work in TITANIC for me because I want to believe in Jack and Rose's story. I do not want to dwell on the possibility that Jack is some kind of confidence man, and Cameron doesn't, though he allows the other characters in the film to take advantage of Jack's lower class to exploit this possibility in the mind of others.\n\nCameron frames his movie through the lens of Gloria Stuart as Old Rose. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) is a deep sea treasure hunter on the trail of the Heart of the Ocean. He doesn't find it, but he does uncover a nude drawing of a woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean. Back in the States, Old Rose is living with her granddaughter (Suzy Amis), sees the report, and contacts Brock's expedition, who fly her out to question her about the diamond's whereabouts.\n\nWhile Brock and his crew are unemotional treasure hunters, but they become sucked in to Rose's story. (Again, Cameron's penchant for simple characters works to his benefit here, in part because of the story and in part because he's hired actors like Bill Paxton who can convincingly portray simple characters and still make them seem like real people.) Occasionally, throughout the film, Cameron cuts back to Old Rose telling the story to the crew and I know this is a small, obvious thing to do, but it really works for me to see these cynical guys drawn completely into this old woman's story.\n\nTITANIC does play a bit loose with Rose's story. Either what we're watching is literally her version of events, in which case she's filling in details that she couldn't possibly know about (like what was going on in scenes where she wasn't present), or we're watching what actually happened, and getting more information than Brock's expedition.\n\nWhen the film ends, Brock tells Rose's granddaughter that he's spent three years thinking of nothing but Titanic, but he never understood until he heard Old Rose's story. It's a powerful moment, delivered in a wonderfully understated manner by Paxton, and speaks to why it's critically important that personal stories of historical tragedies are told. Life is more than an accumulation of facts and dates and figures and TITANIC brings that home. Yeah, it's a made-up love story set in the middle of a true tragedy, and yeah, Cameron is more interested in emotional truth than historical truth, but I'm okay with that.\n\nTITANIC is a big, powerful, Hollywood love story, and I love every frame of it. In the final scene, when Old Rose dies or dreams her way back down to the sunken Titanic beneath them to find all of the dead waiting for her, and then applaud her return and reunion with Jack, it stands as a powerful moment of a life well lived, and celebrates that most sacred human connection:\n\nEvery once in awhile a film comes along that restores your faith in the film industry. BLACK DEATH is such a film; this is not to suggest that BLACK DEATH is some amazing cinematic achievement that cannot be missed. Rather, it's a straightforward film with an intelligent story that's skillfully executed; BLACK DEATH is a good, serious movie with plenty of moral ambiguity and no easy answers.\n\nSet during the 14th century European pandemic, BLACK DEATH tells the story of Ulric (Sean Bean) and his band of soldiers, charged with the church to investigate a remote village that's been untouched by the plague. Joining them is Osmund (Eddie Redmayne), a young bishop from the nearby monastery who's fallen in love with a woman named Averill (Kimberly Nixon). Osmund doubts his faith because of his love for Averill (whom he sends away to escape the plague), and prays for a sign from God.\n\nThat's when Ulric shows up looking for volunteers to lead his men to the village deep in the marsh. Osmund takes this as a sign to go with Ulric, despite the objections of the Abbot (David Warner).\n\nThrough this early stage of the movie, there's lots of dirt and death and darkness. Importantly, you feel all of it. It's impossible not to compare BLACK DEATH with the recent Nicolas Cage flick, Season of the Witch, since I watched it recently, but where that movie is a slick, soulless, supernatural thriller, DEATH revels in the mud, confusion, and uncertainty that accompanied the plague.\n\nUlric is off to track down a witch, so he and his men journey through the countryside and through a spooky forest. Ulric's men are professional killers and torturers, hardly upstanding Christians despite their working on the church's behalf, but they're not black hat evil guys, either. They're just men, doing bad things because the Church has told them they can. That kind of moral confusion is everywhere in BLACK DEATH. Director Christopher Smith and screenwriter Dario Poloni make these costumes feel like real, individual men in a real, complex situation. It doesn't matter that I couldn't name any of them except Wolfstan (John Lynch) and Mold (Johnny Harris) without looking at the internet because when I was watching the movie I could count on them to do interesting things.\n\nOsmund has trouble adjusting to everything the soldiers tell him; he's a servant of God who feels he has betrayed God because of his love for Averill, and now he's confronted with hardened soldiers who murder and torture who proclaim there's witches in the world. Osmund doesn't believe it and the men just kind of grunt and spit at him and tell him he'll find out soon enough.\n\nWhen they get to the spooky, mist-enshrouded woods, Osmund wakes up early so he can go look for Averill. When she left she told him she'd wait for him every morning for a week at a tree. When she said it I groaned at how stupid it was (okay, maybe I rolled my eyes instead of groaning), but the movie doesn't do what you'd expect; Osmund doesn't reunite with Averill at the end of the movie, but rather about halfway through he goes to the tree and finds \u2026 clothes, blood, and bad guys. There's a big fight scene but the bigger impact is that Osmund's world continues to spiral. He leads Ulric's men through the marsh and into the village full of healthy people.\n\nIt's here where the movie turns from pretty good to pretty awesome. The village isn't just where the end of the movie takes place \u2013 there's no final, big battle confrontation against the witch and her spooky locals \u2013 but a whole extended sequence that sees the soldiers asking for solace and the locals drugging their food and drink in order to kill them. It's a really exciting turn when the average villagers get the best of the experienced soldiers. That even includes Ulric, who's convinced there's actual evil here, yet lets his guard down long enough to eat their food and drink their drink.\n\nWhile this is going on, the head witch Langiva (a fantastic Carice van Houten) takes Osmund into the woods where she lets him witness a spooky ceremony where she brings Averill back from the dead. Osmund freaks, but it doesn't matter because he still ends up in the water cage the next morning with the rest of the soldiers. Langiva and her henchman Hob (Tim McInnerny) order the soldiers to renounce their faith. The first guy refuses and gets crucified and gutted. Then the group's charmer says he'll renounce, so they make him kneel and renounce God while Ulric and his men stand in the water behind him, shouting at him to not lose faith. Langiva promises freedom if the men renounce, death if they don't. Wolfstan implores the charmer to not renounce because these villagers are going to kill all of them anyway, but Swire renounces, gets led into the forest, and then hung from a tree.\n\nWhile this is happening, Osmund huddles in the corner, shivering and crying. He gets pulled out next, Langiva promising him that he'll renounce. She sends Osmund into a nearby building where Averill waits for him. When he gets there, Averill is all loony. Osmund is convinced it's because she's been brought back from the dead, which is an abomination to God, so he kills her and carries her dead body outside, then slashes Langiva across the cheek with a knife.\n\nSo Hob beats the crap out of him.\n\nIt's Ulric's turn next and he refuses to renounce despite being pulled wide by two horses. Before his body is literally ripped, he asks to see Osmund. Langiva allows it and Ulric orders Osmund to open his shirt, which reveals he's been carrying the plague all along, meaning that he's brought the plague into this village in order to enact God's revenge.\n\nIt's a wonderful sequence, building on Ulric's hatred of the necromancer Langiva and Langiva's hatred of Christians. Langiva \"wins\" by having Ulric's arms and legs ripped off and Ulric \"wins\" by delivering the plague to the village, proving that Langiva isn't a witch that can keep her people protected.\n\nDEATH gets even better, each subsequent ending topping the previous one. Osmund goes after Langiva and when he finds her she tells him that she's not a witch, at all, meaning she never brought Averill back from the dead because Averill was never dead. Langiva simply drugged the girl in order to perform a \"miracle,\" basically admitting to Osmund that she did it because people need a show in order to follow someone.\n\nThe realization that he was the only one to kill Averill absolutely crushes Osmund, and we learn from Wolfstan that Osmund went on to become a hardened killer for the church, scouring the countryside to bring witches to justice. The problem is that he keeps seeing Langiva \"in the eyes of the accused,\" meaning he's putting innocent women to death in an attempt to get his revenge on the witch that admitted she wasn't even a witch.\n\nIt's an incredibly powerful ending. BLACK DEATH rewards you for sticking with it and then sticks with an honest, if unpleasant, ending. There's no happy ending here, because how could there be a happy ending during the plague? Love in the Time of Pandemic? BLACK DEATH is too smart for that. The moral ambiguity between the Christians and the pagans is strong because both sides are right and wrong at various times, and when Wolfstan is securing Hob in the torture rack and asks why he would follow the witch, Hob's answer is stunning in its simplicity.\n\n\"Because she was beautiful,\" he says, without regret.\n\nAnd in a world ravaged with the plague, what better reason does one need?\n\nSCREAM 2 is both a really fun film and a mildly disappointing sequel. If you like the characters of Sidney (Neve Campbell), Dewey (David Arquette), Gale (Courteney Cox), and Randy (Jamie Kennedy), SCREAM 2 provides plenty of thrills and chills for the main stars, but if you're looking for a story as solid as the original SCREAM, you're likely to become increasingly disappointed as the movie progresses, as much of the cinematic energy is locked into the film's opening half.\n\nSCREAM 2 sees Sidney and Randy relocated to Windsor College. Sidney's got a perky roommate\/best friend named Hallie (Elise Neal), a perfect new boyfriend named Derek (Jerry O'Connell) and the same old unrequited lapdog in Randy. Everything is progressing spectacularly for Sid (including a sweet-*ss dorm room that they definitely did not have at Syracuse), whose biggest concern seems to be Hallie attempting to use her to get into a sorority. The lead sorority sisters (Portia De Rossi and Rebecca Gayheart) want Sidney in their sorority because notoriety is, like, wicked awesome or something.\n\nThe problems start for Sidney with the release of Stab, a horror movie based on the events of SCREAM. There's a good bit of fun seeing the \"real\" transformed into the \"fictional,\" complete with Heather Graham as Casey Becker\/Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson as Billy Loomis\/Skeet Ulrich, and Tori Spelling as Sidney\/Campbell. The Spelling bit is an in-joke since Sidney complained in SCREAM that if her life was turned into a movie, they'd likely get Tori Spelling to play her. Just as writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven engineered in SCREAM, SCREAM 2 starts with a murder that's personally disconnected from Sidney. Here, we have Phil and Maureen (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett) getting offed at the premiere of Stab.\n\nIt's a pretty good opening, with the same kind of \"horror knowledge\" interplay between audience and characters as we have in SCREAM. Phil and Maureen are black, and black people, as they're both aware, don't have a very high survival rate in horror movies. Unfortunately, where Williamson was willing to tweak conventions in SCREAM, here he mostly embraces them, as both Maureen and Phil are murdered during the showing of the movie. Later, Sidney's friend Hallie (also black) similarly gets killed, even though it's Sidney who's being the dumb\/brave one when she goes back to the scene of an accident to try and ascertain Ghostface's identity. She goes back to the car and Ghostface isn't there because he's gone around the back to kill Hallie.\n\nIt's an important killing that gets completely overlooked when it happens; it's not that Sidney isn't affected by the death, but it's impact is lessened by its placement, coming in between Ghostface kidnapping them by hijacking the cop car they were riding in and Sidney's mad dash to the theater house where the final violent act occurs. It's the only death in the movie that's really personal; Ghostface is revealed here to be Derek's best friend Mickey (Timothy Olyphant), who keeps getting rebuffed during the movie by Hallie in several small scenes. It's telling, too, that he makes certain to kill Randy, too, while failing to finish off Dewey, given that Randy is Mickey's rival in film class. He's also successful in killing fellow film class student Cici Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and his best friend Derek, suggesting that it's the deaths that he's most personally involved in that he sees through to the end. It's the attempts on Sidney, Dewey, and Gale that come up short, and these are the deaths that his sponsor, Billy Loomis' mother (Laurie Metcalf) has the most interest in seeing completed.\n\nThe revelation that Mickey is the killer is a bit lame because Mickey is gone for a huge section of the movie. Also, the swerve that local news reporter Debbie Salt is actually Mrs. Loomis comes up completely flat because for it to work two things have to be believed: that Sidney, Dewey, and Randy never see her in the pack of reporters (since Sidney recognizes her instantly) and that Gale doesn't recognize her despite having multiple confrontations with her throughout the movie. Her insistence that, \"I've seen Billy's mom but she doesn't look like that,\" comes up short.\n\nThe worst part of this final act, however, is that Williamson and Craven decide to have Mrs. Loomis and Mickey act all bug-eyed crazy. It's stupid. We did that last movie, and having stone cold killers would have been a nice change.\n\nIf you want to give Williamson and Craven some leeway, it certainly exists. The original script had Mrs. Loomis working with Hallie, Derek, and Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) instead of Mickey, but when the entire script was leaked online, they were forced to re-write the film on the fly.\n\nEither because the scenes were leftover from the original script, or because Craven and the actors had a real feel for how these characters would react in these situations, it's the scenes between the returning cast members that work best. The growing relationship between Dewey and Gale is wonderfully played by Arquette and Cox; he's miffed at her for writing less-than-flattering things about him in her best-selling book, The Westboro Murders, and she's still drawn to him, increasingly seeing him as a real person instead of a source. As annoying as Randy is, his death sequence is very well done. Ghostface calls the three of them as they're standing on campus and Randy is given the task of talking to him while Dewey and Gale go looking for him. When Randy gets close to Gale's news van, the killer opens the sliding door, pulls Randy inside, and gruesomely knifes him to death.\n\nRandy's death is the only part of the film that feels like SCREAM 2 is its own film, rather than a cog in a franchise that demands as many of the popular characters, as possible, survive in order to guarantee the bankability of the third film. That's not to say SCREAM 2 is a bad movie; it's mostly an enjoyable film that balances a strong use of returning characters in an interesting enough story. Like The Empire Strikes Back, SCREAM 2 is also the film where the lead shifts from it's first star (Luke\/Sidney) to its more interesting character (Han\/Dewey and Gale), and that's why the film is ultimately worth watching, despite its limp, bug-eyed finish"}
{"text":"On \"Miss Bala\"\n\nThe film \"Miss Bala\" is a powerful and truly realistic (and pretty violent and ugly) depiction of the current drug war in Mexico. The film begins with a 23 year old lady named Laura Guerrero (played beautifully by Stephanie Sigman) who wants to enter and win a beauty pageant. What happens is that Laura Guerrero gets caught up in the brutal and vicious drug war and becomes involved with a powerful drug lord. Her beautiful dream of being a beauty queen quickly spirals into a descent into hell as she is caught between the forces of drug war rivals and a brutal and corrupt military using every means to crush the drug lords even if it destroys the innocent. In this movie there are no winners and no real good guys, but plenty of victims.\n\nThis movie is all too real about the present day drug war conflict. The film makes it very clear that as long as there is corruption then the Mexican government's drug war is futile. It is very clear that the real war should be against corruption and the brutality shown by both sides. Clearly Laura Guerrero is symbolic of Mexico's people being caught in the middle between the drug cartels and the Mexican government's policy against the cartels. I find the violence in the film very disturbing, but it is meant to be disturbing. This film does not attempt to glorify the drug cartels, and that is a departure from many other films. The film is a very serious look at Mexico today and how the drug war conflict impacts the people. \"Miss Bala\" was directed by Gerardo Naranja."}

Understated lines such as \"my mum gave a hand job to a mystic\" could go unnoticed by an inattentive audience; every exchange has a hidden reward if picked up on. There are of course obvious jokes throughout, however the true comedy is found in Oliver Tate's voice over and interactions.\n\nCasting Craig Roberts as Oliver Tate was a masterstroke and much of the film's success is based on his performance. The imaginative and peculiar schoolboy analyses everything, often conjuring up fictional events which parody mainstream movies. In one such hypothetical situation he sees Jordana (Yasmin Paige) by the shore and runs to her, meanwhile his narration explains that it isn't her standing there, a stranger turns around.\n\nSubmarine is a simple coming of age story, without the solid plot of the British film veterans. A little slow paced on occasion, it could have done with an extra thread of story. In essence the narrative follows two strands, the relationship between Oliver and Jordana and between Oliver and his family. Trying to date Jordana and reignite the spark between his parents isn't a small task, not that that fazes Oliver.\n\nSubmarine is devilishly funny, a true gem and I hope it doesn't stay under the radar of most cinema goers for much longer.\n\n26 of 31 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?"}

A\"sequel\" to In China They Eat Dogs with Harald,Peter,Martin,Ratko and Vuk reprising their roles (which takes some doing as they were all killed in the first film,Old Men inhabits the same amoral,ultra violent parallel universe of the first film with Harald doing everything on \"Harald Time\" where no is never the right answer and no obstacle cannot be overcome Hilarious situations,fantastic dialogue and performances, the scene where Harald,peter and Martin try to book into a hotel is a classic moment. Arguably both films are in incredibly bad taste but the sheer inventiveness of the material and the playing with of different genres has to be seen to be believed. Comparisons to Lock,Stock etc only serve to show up the paucity of that film's ambitions,this is the real deal- utterly brilliant. Buy both they deserve to be better known (as does Danish cinema- see Pusher Trilogy and Bleeder too).\n\n'Old Men in New Cars' is a follow on to In China They Eat Dogs (Region 2) Import, with most of the cast being the same - so a group of Danish criminals (with a rival Balkan band) engaged in very violent and more or less funny endeavours.\n\nHarald (Kim Bodnia), freshly out of prison is called to the 'deathbed of his 'Godfather', whose last wish is to see his biological son. Simple enough, if the boy were not locked up in a high security prison in Sweden. This, along with robbing a bank, kidnapping and hijacking a Danish Airforce Hercules are amongst the capers the little band of Harald's merry restaurateurs gets involved in.\n\nThat is not to say the movie is without merit and it is definitely funny in a slightly ultra violence, demented fashion. An interesting piece of entertainment but more for a boy's night than a romantic afterdinner movie with your female partner...\n\nIt's not very surprising that this action\/comedy\/gangster flick from Denmark hasn't received much attention: the title misleadingly gives the impression that this will be rather boring to watch. Refreshingly, the follow-up to In China They Eat Dogs doesn't have any old men in new cars at all. What it does have is a lot of subtle but dubious humour written by one of the masters of black comedy: Anders Thomas Jensen (Adam's Apples).\n\nAfter Harald (Kim Bodnia - Pusher) has been released from incarceration he visits his dying boss\/surrogate father, Munken, on his death bed who informs Harald that he wishes to see his son before he passes away. The problem being that his Swedish son, Ludvig, is serving a life sentence in a high security prison for mass murder: a vital piece of information that hasn't been disclosed by Munken to Harald.\n\nHarald instructs his Bakery friends, Peter and Martin (Nikolaj Lie Kaas - Green Butchers) that they have to come up with a fool proof plan to free the psychotic Ludvig and grant Munken his dying wish. Meanwhile, Ratko (Slavko Labovic - Pusher) and his vicious gang are threatening to kill Harald unless he repays the 3.5million Kroner he owes within the three weeks they have allocated him to find the hefty sum.\n\nAfter the basic scenario has been laid down a series of highly charged scenes ensue with: bank heists, bullet strewn car chases, bungee jumping prison escapes, plane hijacking with a half dead doped up pilot, double crossings, murder with necrophilic implications, a redemptive romance of sorts and perfectly scripted cultural misunderstandings; making this action packed, genre bending spectacle an absolute howler of a comedy - recommended."}

One is that it is easy to mistake what you see. Another is that it is easier to be brave when you're blind, or when you close your eyes.

{"text":"It's said that an effective writer writes what he or she knows. Not of married life, but Kris and Lindy tend to inject hope into each of their films. While that hope may not include a happy ending, it does include a satisfactory resolution to their character's drama.\n\nKaren and Will (Karie Gonia and Ernie Joseph) are moving out of their idyllic cabin in the mountains. Their relationship has seen tough times, and even though they still live and sleep together, it seems like they both lead solitary lives apart from one another. It's evident that Karen still longs for the passion that has gone from their relationship, but they are too far gone as a couple to rekindle that flame without a significant push. Enter Eric and Sandy (Mark Carr and Wonder Russell), a couple leading a gypsy-like existence of free love and no responsibility. Their worlds collide and they become a part of each other's lives, showing each other the things that they're missing in their respective relationships. For Will and Karen, it's showing them the life that they've been missing, and for Sandy and Eric it's showing them showing them something more traditional, and inciting a little jealousy. Neither way of life seems to be right or wrong, but instead just decisions made and consequences lived with, and regrets on both sides.\n\nSmall details in this film really inject reality into their characters, and the filmmakers turn a simple game of Monopoly into a metaphor for Karen and Will's marriage. \"There's not enough money\", \"we're going to do it right\", these are arguments that extend beyond a board game. Will throwing the board aside is a symbol of their marriage. He's tried and now he just wants to cast it aside and stop feeling like a failure. The film can come off a bit heavy-handed at times, but it's these small details, combined with excellent cinematography, the charisma of all of the actors and actresses, and the stunning locales that truly make THIS IS OURS a film to watch.\n\nThe acting all around is stellar. It's evident that many of them aren't just saying the words on the page, but making their parts their own by channeling life experiences. There's no faking going on in this film, but genuine heart and feeling being put into every scene. The synergy between the actors and directors make this a piece of modern Americana.

Its not even a character study as much as just a study of the idea of addiction. Its sex addiction, because drugs and alcohol seem too specific unto themselves. Also, there's a bit of a misconception that sex addiction isn't real. This amazing film shows, not so much the horror of addiction, but the pure misery of it. Because it is sex, which can and should be enjoyable, that is making someone miserable is very effective. The best part is the dynamic between him and his sister. Just her existence, and knowing that she has her own brand of screwed up-ness going on, tells us all we need to know about their childhoods. Simple and powerful. And generally amazing!!"}

{"text":"Summary:Through a series of military and political accidents, a psychotic general - U.S. Air Force Commander Jack D. Ripper (Hayden) - triggers an ingenious, irrevocable scheme to attack Russia's strategic targets with nuclear bombs. The U.S. President (Sellers) and Dr. Strangelove (Sellers), a wheelchair-bound nuclear scientist who has bizarre ideas about man's future, work with the Soviet premier in a desperate effort to save the world.\u2026Expand\n\nSeen after 30 years, Dr. Strangelove seems remarkably fresh and undated - a clear-eyed, irreverant, dangerous satire. And its willingness to follow the situation to its logical conclusion - nuclear annihilation - has a purity that today's lily-livered happy-ending technicians would probably find a way around.\n\nDr. Strangelove is very simply one of the best films ever made. It easily takes the title of best comedy film. Wickedly smart and satirical, Dr. Strangelove still very much applies to the present day situation, 47 years later. Superbly acted, well written, and directed by the great Kubrick, Strangelove delivers everything you could want from a movie: humor, drama, history, and a main character with Alien Hand Syndrome. No matter what kind of movies you like, Dr. Strangelove is for you.\u2026Expand\n\nAccording to Morrissey's recent manifestation \"more gay people, more peaceful the world\", war is the malicious ramification of heterosexual meual men's urge to kill their peers (I'm paraphrasing here), which tallies germanely with this Kubrick's black war satire. Under the cold war backdrop, a rogue nuclear attack to Soviet Union commenced by a fervid anti-communist USA general, which would (irrevocably) launch a doomsday machine (a Soviet Union's ultimate self-destructive nuclear contraption), and would annihilate all the human beings on the earth. It may sounds ridiculous and far-fetched by the mass, Kubrick's masterful endeavor has overcome the detached accessibility of the warfare lingoes and the exclusivity of the decision-makers' political impasse to implement a stranger-than-fiction satire which grants a considerable closeness to its audience with ease. Running within 100 minutes, the film slickly unreels its storyline with great force of dark humor which imbues parodic and even cartoonish idiosyncrasies to the permeating machismo in the air. Peter Sellers' three-faceted versatility, George C. Scott's Communism-slamming extravaganza and Sterling Hayden's trigger-happy paranoia plus Slim Pickens' cowboy hat, the ensemble cast owns their respective frantic glory within a compacted steak of time, umpteen gags and mockeries can be savored ad infinitum, Sellers'British accent (as Group Captain) when confronting Sterling's General Rippers is unimpeachably spontaneous, Keenan Wynn's coca-cola joke is pertinently deadpan serious and Sterling's conspiracy theory about water fluoridation and the fearful deprivation of life essence during a sexual intercourse (the man just cannot face his natural aging mechanism of the body) are plainly golden ideas, outlandish but vividly rib-tickling, and astringently self-reflective.\n\nKubrick's trademark set design which would prevail in his later color features has not fully exploited this black-and-white war farce, and the (not-too-obvious) misogyny and chauvinism overtone does impede the sensitive nerves a bit, nevertheless, it is not my favorite Kubrick's film, but it is an outstanding comedy which I presume can stay untainted by numerous re-watches, for me the first round is more than gratifying and since my generally inert resistance towards war-related films, a second round may take some time despite of its overall peerlessness.\u2026Expand\n\nI honestly don't get why this movie is being hyped so much. I watched it because everyone seems to be so positive about it, but this movie was so boring that I wanted to put it off halfways. It's absolutely NOT funny, or maybe I just don't have any humor...or maybe you're all jumping on the bandwagon. I know that there are a lot of Kubrick fans out there who love everything that he has made, just because he made it! If it had been made by somebody else everyone would have disliked this movie!\u2026Expand"}
{"text":"Moreland at the Movies: Invictus (video)\n\nIt's 1995; Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela became president of South Africa the year earlier after having spent 27 years in jail for leading the fight against Apartheid.\n\nInvictus tells the story of how Mandela (Morgan Freeman) uses the South African rugby team, the Springboks, to help unite the country still reeling from decades of racial division. The Springboks deeply loved by white South Africa and just as deeply despised by black South Africans who viewed the team as symbol white racial domination. Mandela embraces the team and reaches out to the Springbok's captain, Francois Pienaar, (Matt Damon) as a means of reassuring whites that their cherished institutions such as the team would not parish while convincing blacks that they too should become fans of their nation's team. This was especially important since South Africa was hosting the world cup in Rugby that year.\n\nInvictus while a fascinating and uplifting story fails due to the necessary ingredients to any great film: a powerful and legitimate conflict. The blacks have to be convinced to support a team they loathed. This was not a real issue because they so revered Mandela that at his simple request they became fans. The screenwriter also tried to create suspense by showing how the President's life was in constant endanger. But it is well known that Mandela is alive and well despite being 91 years old. So any scenes trying to generate drama due possible threats to Mandela were undermined by the known facts.\n\nThere are a number of intense competitive rugby scenes but because the sport is not popular or the rules well known in the U.S. those scenes are decidedly uninteresting.\n\nThe acting is strong. Both Freeman and Damon show why they are two of the great performers today. However, Freeman's performance is slightly flawed because he slips in and out of his South African accent.\n\nFurther at two hours and 11 minutes, Invictus is too much of a mediocre thing. It's rated PG-13. It gets a RENT IT rating."}
{"text":"anna\n\nThe action-thriller 'Hanna' is all stylish teen angst ... with a body count.\n\nLife can be hard for a 16-year-old girl. Clueless parents, frenemies,\nboy trouble, pressure over grades, zits: The dramas are nearly\nShakespearean. And that doesn't even take into account the shadowy\ngovernment agents out to get you.\n\nThat last problem is the chief one facing the title character of \"Hanna,\" a sleek thriller opening Friday, buoyed by smart performances and a director eager to prove his action chops.\n\nAs the story opens, Hanna (Saorise Ronan, \"The Lovely Bones\") and her father, an ex-CIA agent named Erik (Eric Bana, \"The Time Traveler's Wife\"), live in the snowy isolation of Scandinavia. Dad has kept Hanna from civilization and raised her as an expert in survival. She speaks several languages, has memorized encyclopedias and can deliver a serious ass-kicking.\n\nSuch skills prove useful when she decides to leave the nest. A former colleague of Erik's, the icy and cruel Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett, \"Robin Hood\"), has made it her life's mission to track down Hanna. What follows is a global chase as the trio cuts zigzag paths before converging at an abandoned amusement park in Berlin.\n\nFeature-debuting screenwriters Seth Lochhead and David Farr offer tantalizing dribbles of information as Hanna and Marissa close in on one another. What is the relationship between the three? What does Marissa want with the girl? And why is Hanna so damned good at killing people?\n\nAlong the way, Hanna hitches a ride with a British family touring Morocco. For the girl, who knows her way with a gun but can be overwhelmed by a TV or teakettle, the clan provides a glimpse into a curiously loving world. Hanna develops an affecting friendship with Sophie (Jessica Barden, \"Tamara Drewe\"), a teenager with decidedly nonlethal preoccupations.\n\nWhy is she so damned good at killing people?\n\nDirector Joe Wright packs \"Hanna\" with wit, style and a clockmaker's precision. He deftly calibrates between scenes of emotional intensity and visceral action, the latter of which is staged with a rare clarity, given today's penchant for hyper-editing.\n\nWright has particular fun with set pieces. In a single, uninterrupted shot, he follows Bana from a bus station to an underground garage, where he is attacked by a group of government agents. It's an eye-popping bit of filmmaking similar to a stunt he pulled of in \"Atonement.\" The stylistic flourishes are occasionally excessive; a propulsive score by The Chemical Brothers alternates between exhilaration and distraction.\n\nThe movie is not just bells and whistles. Ronan imbues the enigmatic Hanna with an otherworldliness that doesn't obscure the girl's vulnerability. Blanchett is delightfully nefarious, while Bana does the most with an underwritten role. And Bardem supplies some welcome humor.\n\n\"Hanna\" ultimately adds up to something a bit less than its parts, perhaps inevitable when the questions and buildup are more interesting than the eventual revelation. Still, a lot of movies have third-act stumbles, and \"Hanna\" manages better than most. This is one case of teen angst well worth catching."}
{"text":"YOUR FRIENDS' ACTIVITY\n\nAdams on Reel Women: Fathers and Daughters Have 'Trouble With the Curve'\n\nParents die a lot in movies. From \"Bright Eyes,\" starring Shirley Temple, to Disney's \"The Lion King,\" a parent's sudden death is a plot device that frees the hero or heroine to develop against the backdrop of tragedy. Life hurts: How will you deal with it, punk? All the \"Godfather\" movies, and countless others, are about the relationships between fathers and sons. And there are some really fine movies about fathers and daughters -- although \"Trouble With the Curve\" is no \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" In the laugh-tinged drama, a crusty baseball scout, Gus (Clint Eastwood), and his intimacy-averse lawyer daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), gradually resolve their fractured relationship and exhume some tired secrets on a road trip to scout a high school slugger. \"Curve\" penetrated my defenses by appreciating the father-daughter bond in a way few recent movies have.\n\nIf the formula of the romcom is that the couple meets cute, the drama of reconciliation begins with events forcing family members back into each other's company after they have withdrawn to lick their wounds and get on with their lives. In this kind of drama, it's assumed that the characters can never be whole, or happy, if they don't operate on that festering familial wound. So, when Gus's failing vision starts threatening his career scouting for the Atlanta Braves and his behavior becomes increasingly erratic, his best friend (John Goodman) calls Mickey to come home and ferret out what's really going on with her father. He is prickly and stubborn; she is wounded and proud. They're clearly two peas in a pod, only it takes a long recruiting trip to Florida and a series of tatty motel rooms, a car accident, a bar fight, and a gentleman caller (Justin Timberlake) to get them to admit it.\n\nThe formula works in \"Trouble With the Curve,\" in part, because the performances satisfy largely without straining. Even when the subject matter abuts Lifetime movie-of-the-week territory, the actors resist. Adams can do the easy ginger-haired charmer, but it's in the moments when the pretty-girl smile stops well before it reaches her eyes that the audience leans forward and takes notice. She shares too much and then withholds too much, as if there's slippage between the confident Mickey she created in college and law school and the motherless child abandoned by her father. Adams will get more attention for her steely wife in \"The Master,\" but she's no less committed here, because this is her chance to act opposite the legend, Eastwood. She doesn't waste a take. As for playing papa, this is not the Eastwood of \"Dirty Harry\" or \"Unforgiven.\" It's the lanky loser who talks with his fists seen before in the action comedies \"Every Which Way but Loose\" and \"Bronco Billy.\" In some ways, it's a return to form, aging out the shaggy quiche-spurning Eastwood, a star whose masculinity both defines him and, occasionally, boxes him in.\n\nThe movie has its maudlin moments. A graveside scene where Gus talk-sings a Rex Harrison version of \"You Are My Sunshine\" to his late wife, followed by a closeup of Eastwood breaking into tears, is too much on-the-nose information. And, then, as if that wasn't enough, later in the movie, Mickey picks up the tune. It reflects an insecurity on the part of first-time director Robert Lorenz (Eastwood's longtime assistant director). Lorenz doesn't yet know when to pull back and trust the material.\n\nDespite the bumpy bits, the emotional truth of the bond between Mickey and Gus emerges organically in the quieter moments. That is what makes \"Trouble With the Curve\" worth watching and Mickey an empathetic character with whom many women can identify. The connection between daughters and fathers starts early, often as the father leads an active life and the daughter trails behind trying to keep up with knees that are at her eye level. As the father plays basketball (as mine did), or scouts baseball (as Eastwood does), the daughter shares his vision. It's as if they gaze at the world through one set of eyes. Or as Mickey says to Gus, \"Spending every waking moment with my dad watching baseball -- those were the best seats in the house.\" Hankie, please!"}

I'm not gonna tell you a pack of lies to make me look good. I'm just gonna tell you what happened. See more \u00bb\n\n\"Lord of War\" is about a man named Yuri (Nicolas Cage) who in the early\n80's decides that he doesn't want to just work in a restaurant for the\nrest of his life and decides that instead he wants to be an arms\ndealer. Once he makes his first sale, Yuri is hooked on the feeling of\nmaking big money for selling firearms, and continues to sell the\nfirearms but he wants more and more of a profit and more and more of a\nchallenge. It's not until an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) is hot on\nYuri's case that he begins to question the nature of his business and\nwhether what he is doing for a living is moral and if he should be\nresponsible for the hands these weapons get into and what they are used\nfor. A powerful performance by Nicolas Cage, as well as a great\nthought-provoking movie ensues I love movies like this one for a few\nreasons. The main reason is that for the most part you can't predict\nwhat is going to happen next or where the film is going. Another reason\nI like movies like this is because it's powerful and its makes you\nthink. And lastly I like a movie like this because it doesn't end in a\ntypical way and actually leaves you feeling blown-away and surprised.\n\nThe filmed starred Nicolas Cage who lately has done of some the best\nwork of his career. His performance here is top-notch and powerful.\nThere are so many other people in the film including Jared Leto, Ian\nHolm, Ethan Hawke and Bridget Moynahan to name a few who are also very\ngood at the roles they played. This film is written and directed by\nAndre Niccol the same man who wrote \"The Terminal\" and \"The Truman\nShow\" so I guess I shouldn't be so surprised by why I actually liked\nthis film so much, it had a good lead actor and a good screenwriter.\n\nI guess this movie all comes down to how open minded the movie-goers\nwho see this are. I guess it also amounts to where you stand on the\npolitical fence. The film is not for those who don't have an open mind\nabout things that are going on in the world today. The movie is based\non true events so be warned that some of things shown in the film are\nhappening in real life or did happen at one point in time. To be\nhonest, I do believe what the film states in the end, it doesn't seem\nat all far fetched. It's like Yuri says in the film \"it's not our war\nand no matter what we do we can't stop it\" and that's true it's like\nsmoking kills people every day but there are people who run cigarette\ncompanies everyday knowing that they are killing people every single\nday and getting people addicted to something that in the end will kill\nthem. Is that moral? What can we do to stop it? These are questions\nthis film asks and leaves it to the viewer to decide on.\n\nSo in the end, this movie isn't for everyone. In a sense this film is\nkind of like the movie \"Blow\" because it's about a man who feels his\nlife isn't complete without selling something that is bad. He has\neverything he could ever want but still needs to sell the firearms.\nIt's an amazing and powerful story which I feel really puts things in\nperspective as far as us Americans look at things. Nicolas Cage's\nperformance is incredible as he seems to not care at all for the\npeople's lives he puts at stake every day and when it comes to his own\nlife he still seems unemotional and doesn't seem to worry. Personally I\nthink this is one of the best film's of year and is in fact just as\ngood as the other political drama currently released called \"The\nConstant Gardner\" so if you have an open mind about things and enjoy\nmovies that will make you think, well check out \"Lord of War\" because\nit's well worth the price of admission at the theater"}
{"text":"Salute Your Shorts: Debra Granik's \"Snake Feed\"\n\nSalute Your Shorts is a weekly column that looks at short films, music videos, commercials or any other short form visual media that generally gets ignored.\n\nAlthough we didn't cover it in our 2010 Sundance roundup, one of the films we noted to watch out for was Debra Granik's Winter's Bone. The movie took away Sundance's Grand Jury Prize, won several awards at the Berlin Festival and has been picking up critical raves since its first screening. Unfortunately, despite the accolades it's being released by small indie-distributor Roadside Attractions, which doesn't have the money to try and make this festival darling into a big hit. Unless you really follow Sundance, you're probably unaware that the movie landed in limited theaters last Friday.\n\nThis is too bad, as Debra Granik is an example of what Sundance is really all about. Although major studios have been using the festival as a marketplace since Steven Soderbergh's Sex, Lies, and Videotape blew up in 1989, it's essentially supposed to be about fostering young filmmakers' voices. Granik's latest project is only her most recent success at Sundance, but the festival has been supportive of her throughout her career. Her feature debut Down to the Bone won the festival's Special Jury Prize, which helped it gain distribution, and even that was in fact an expansion of her first film short, which won Granik the short filmmaking award.\n\nThat first film was \"Snake Feed,\" which Granik made shortly after finishing her masters at the Tisch School of Arts at NYU. Like Down to the Bone, it focuses on a woman trying to raise her family despite a drug addiction. In the feature, the film's protagonist in fact spends the movie itself dealing with this problem, making it into a sort of counterpart to Half Nelson. The short that inspired it, the aforementioned \"Snake Feed,\" is in fact fairly different form this despite the part it had in making Down to the Bone possible.\n\n\"Snake Feed\" stars Corinne Stralke as Irene, who, unlike her counterpart, played by Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air), is in fact finished with her drug addiction. Although she was previously hooked on drugs, she's currently off of them and trying to go straight while raising her two children. The film's conflict is simple: she finds out that Rick,who's either her boyfriend or husband, it's not particularly clear, is dealing again, and she doesn't want anything to do with this. She initially confronts him, but he claims it's a very small-time business. She briefly believes him, but when a customer of his returns, it's clear that this isn't the case and she vacuums up his drugs. The film ends on an ambiguous note, where Irene is still struggling with what to do with both Rick and herself.\n\nAdmittedly \"Snake Feed\" isn't the most original work. This is the type of depressing drama that Sundance and other festivals have accustomed us to by now, and even its lack of any real resolution can come off as a cliche. The beauty of the short is how Granik approaches the subject and treats her characters, who are delicately balanced into more than just a typical case of art film lost causes.\n\nGranik's M.O. is indebted to the style of kitchen-sink drama that's become the specialty of contemporary British cinema, a follow-up to the Angry Young Men of the 1950s and 1960s who tried to revolutionize British filmmaking but fell out of fashion almost as they gained success. This is best characterized by films by Ken Loach, Mike Leigh or Andrea Arnold, who've used modern technology to their advantage in telling realistically-drawn stories. The unfortunate part of their style, though, is their tendency towards metaphorical proselytizing. In this sort of cinema, it's become common for a reoccurring concept to scream out symbolism in a way that draws away from their realism. While the camera may be handheld, the writing is frequently overwrought and shrill.\n\nWith \"Snake Feed,\" Granik sets out to copy this sort of filmmaker but with a different type of writing. Admittedly, Granik's dialogue tends toward extreme stylization, but her narrative is much looser. Of the film's 23 minutes, only half or so compose the plot, which is obviously quite loose in any case. The other half is characters being themselves, talking to one another and living life without having the narrative forced upon them. While in some filmmakers' hands this would be tedious, Granik has such a natural sense of pacing and has chosen good enough actors that the documentary realism of things so entracing the lack of a tight plot doesn't detract. It's fascinating simply watching the characters be who they are.\n\nSo \"Snake Feed\"'s meandering, elliptical story is in fact more interesting than a lot of the tighter ones more frequently told in short films. What it does right is picking out characters who feel true, and if they're real enough their situations are less important. It's just nice that Granik decided to expand things into a feature. \"Snake Feed\" is an extra on the DVD for Down to the Bone and like its accompanying films is well worth the time. Hopefully Winter's Bone will surprise me with its success and we'll see Granik get the support to continue making her unique brand of Southern gothic realistic films more than once every five years."}
{"text":"Posts Tagged 'quentin tarantino'\n\nThe Christmas rush of holiday movies is upon us, and if you find this whole notion of peace on earth is already beginning to wear thin, they offer some harrowing alternatives. Two of them, Jack Reacher and Django Unchained, had their premieres cancelled last weekend because their scenes of gun violence were considered inappropriate so soon after the Newtown massacre. Jack Reacher, which reboots Tom Cruise's career as a action hero, has landed with especially unfortunate timing in light of the Sandy Hook massacre\u2014it opens with a scene of a sniper killing five random civilians, including a mother holding a young child. Django, Quentin Tarantino's tale of slave liberation, is tale of merry vengeance that opens Christmas Day.\n\nJack Reacher opens Dec. 21, along with Judd Apatow's fractious family comedy This is 40. Those two studio pictures will likely lead the weekend box office, but also opening Dec. 21 are The Impossible and Rust and Bone, a pair of potent dramas from European directors that could win Oscar recognition. The Impossible is the harrowing tale of a family on holiday torn apart by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami; Rust and Bone is a romance about an animal trainer (Marion Cotillard) who loses both her legs to a renegade killer whale. No one ever said escaping Christmas would be a walk in the park.\n\nSo many movies, so little time. Here's the rundown:\n\nJack Reacher\n\nAs a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, I was as mortified as everyone else when it was first announced that the 5'8\u2033 Tom Cruise would play the 6'5\u2033 Reacher It seemed like a historic coup of miscasting. Since then Child has endorsed both Cruise and the movie, which is loosely based on One Shot, the ninth novel in the Reacher series. Now that I've seen it, I still feel Cruise is miscast, and not just because he's too short. Size doesn't matter so much on the big screen. But character does. Reacher is a rugged Army veteran, a multi-decorated former U.S. Military Police Major, who has gone rogue and become a drifter. Cruise doesn't look like he's a veteran of anything but the gym and the red carpet. Reacher, who has a brutal manner and a forensic intellect, is cool, detached and laconic. He's like a human bullet: smooth, fast and hot. Too intensely polished for the role. That said, he's an athletic actor who is always impressive in hand-to-hand combat. He functions best with blunt, minimalist dialogue, and in that sense he makes the character his own. Continue\u2026\n\nQ: Anyone who takes film seriously in this country knows who Brian D. Johnson is. He's been writing about movies at Maclean's since 1985, he's been to Cannes for the last 18 years in a row, and this will be his 27th year covering the Toronto International Film Festival, and he wrote this book [Brave Films Wild Nights: 25 Years of Festival Fever], which in my opinion should be required reading for any journalist covering the festival. Heck, for anyone who loves movies. Now, Brian, let me get this straight. Your first involvement with TIFF was actually delivering films before you were writing about movies?\n\nA: Oh, yeah. I was a freelancer, and when TIFF came around for three years I paid my dues at the festival by hoisting celluloid up fire escapes to projection booths, which is kind of what you had to do back then. It was really the best job I ever had. I'd pack an Econoline van full of, you know, metal crates of film, and go . . . they treated you like a hero.\n\nQ:Really?\n\nA: You know, people were lined up around the block . . . you know, the organizers are very nervous because if I don't show up with the film . . .\n\nQ:There's not going to be a movie!\n\nA: There's no show. I've never felt such a vital part of the film industry as when I actually delivered the movies to the theatres. It was great. And also it was like going to the gym, you get into great shape.\n\nQ:I can imagine! But then you didn't stop there, you just didn't deliver film, you've had different roles with the festival. Such as\u2026?\n\nA: Well, mostly I've been a film critic, you know, being part of the publicity mill. But I've been a filmmaker, I've had two films programmed at the festival, and this year\u2014I'm kind of dreading it\u2014but I'm an interview subject in a documentary about Garth Drabinsky. So that's going to be a bit weird because, you know, seeing yourself on the big screen is . . . I'm sure that can't be easy. So I'm going to get some of my own medicine, you know?\n\nQ:Exactly! That'll be interesting. Now, listen, when you were a kid is this something that you always thought about? Were films always important to you?\n\nA: Films, no. I mean, I liked movies like any other kid, but movies were not special to me until I became a film critic.\n\nQ:Really?\n\nA: Well, I shouldn't say that. But yeah, so I've had no education in film aside from just watching films at a particularly ripe period during the late '60s and early '70s when that whole kind of New Wave splashed through North America.\n\nQ:You lived through it.\n\nA: Yeah, and everybody who was at all kind of intellectually\/artistically inclined, movies were a huge part of your life. I mean, you know, foreign-language films, we all went to foreign-language films, you know, it just was part of growing up in the late '60s and early '70s. So I had that kind of informal education in film. And I was politically involved, I was kind of left-wing, and also, you know, the New Wave movement, and also film criticism itself\u2014although I didn't know it at the time\u2014was kind of a very, you know, somewhat ideological movement. It was critical of the status quo, it was full of all kind of French structuralist nonsense. But I just lucked into it. I went to journalism first\u2014it's a long story, you don't want to hear the whole story, but basically I was sort of into hard news and then kind of flipped into the arts, and when the Maclean's film critic kind of disappeared I stepped into his shoes, knowing a good job when I saw it.\n\nQ:Enthusiastically, I imagine.\n\nA: Yeah, it's a great job, because films are about everything, so you can basically cover every single kind of human activity and write about it in a way that very few other beats allow you to.\n\nQ:You mentioned that sort of the most memorable moments in the festival sort of in the 1980s and in the early '90s were always in the cinema itself rather than at a party. Do you still feel that way?\n\nA: Well, there have been some good parties, but the amount of time that I've spent sort of chasing celebrities and party tickets and all the rest of it, when you come down to it it's just a blur. But, you know, what really does remain with you. It's the films. And that's particularly true in Cannes as well. I mean, you're in this spectacular fairy-tale setting on the Riviera but it's really in the dark room, that's where the magic happens. And I remember in Toronto at TIFF\u2026 like, increasingly as journalists we have to follow, you know, the Oscar pedigree films because that's what people are interested in. But meanwhile the joy of going to a festival, if you're a cinephile, is that there's this whole world of films that you'll never get another chance to see. You know, or the notion of discovering a film.\n\nQ: Right.\n\nA: And I remember once, after my business was kind of done, towards the end of the festival, Ruby Rich\u2014who's an American critic\u2014and I, we sort of said, \"Let's try to find something,\" you know, \"really interesting to go to.\" We went and we saw this film by Claire Denis, a French director, called Beau Travail, which was set in East Africa in the deserts, the moonscape of East Africa, where you had French Foreign Legionnaires choreographed like modern dancers with a Neil Young song in the background, and it's\u2026 it was like dying and going to heaven because of the surprise. You know, it's like you walk into a theatre not knowing what to expect, not knowing what you're going to see, and then you're transported to another world, and that's the magic which doesn't get old.\n\nQ:Now, listen, you deal with celebrities pretty much on a weekly basis, you're interviewing them for stories and so on. Have you ever been star-struck?\n\nA: Well, it's kind of your professional duty not to be star-struck. Inevitably there are celebrities who pose more of an emotional challenge than others. I mean, outside of film. You know, talking to Mick Jagger is kind of the Everest of interviews, you know, what do you ask and how do you. But part of the way you do a celebrity interview is you establish, as soon as you can, that we're both just people and we have our agendas and you're going to try to make it interesting for them because they're on an assembly line. You're not. I mean, you're on a different kind of assembly line where during a festival you're seeing one celebrity maybe after the other, but they're sitting in a room having one journalist after another come in for maybe eight hours? And I'm not saying we should feel sorry for them\u2014it's a privileged existence\u2014but that is difficult and it's difficult to stay fresh. So it's part of my job as a journalist, not quite buttering them up, but you want to kind of find the moment. You know, you want to find a chemistry of some sort, and usually that means that you're going in there with a very specific set of questions, just like if you're playing a jazz score and you've got the score in front of you, but you've got to be ready right from the opening moment; to find a spontaneous kind of hook into it that doesn't feel scripted.\n\nQ:You just gave away all your trade secrets. I feel so lucky right now!\n\nA: One of my favourite TIFF interviews actually was with Errol Morris, the documentary director, who is a famous interviewer, so my first question was, \"What's the secret to a good interview? \" And he said, \"Shutting up.\"\n\nQ: Oh, wow!\n\nA: And then there was a long pause.\n\nQ:Oh, no!\n\nA: It's true, though.\n\nQ:Really? Because then you are forced to fill in the silence?\n\nA: Yeah, in fact often if you feel uncomfortable with a subject and you don't kind of pave over all of the gaps and if you ask a difficult question then say, \"Like, like, you know, when\u2026\" if you don't do that, you just leave an abyss and let the person fill it, there's something about an open mike where people feel they have to say something, whereas if you make it easy for them you're cutting your own throat as an interviewer.\n\nQ:Twenty-seven years of covering the festival, there must be a moment that stands out. Is there?\n\nA: It's a blur. I wish there was a moment that stood out!\n\nQ:Gotta be one, one juicy little\u2026\n\nA: One juicy little\u2026 I mean, there are lots of moments. I remember meeting Quentin Tarantino with Reservoir Dogs\u2026\n\nQ: Wow.\n\nA: . . . before he was Quentin Tarantino, and you're interviewing him, and this guy was talking, I mean, like a mile a minute. He makes Martin Scorsese sound like he's on Quaaludes he's talking so fast. And I'm asking him about violence, you know, and his language is violent, the way he defends his violence, because it's more disturbing than Hollywood violence. And he'd been up all night partying with his, you know, festival rat friends, Robert Rodriguez and all these guys who are, like, this new sub-wave of American filmmakers that were coming along. In retrospect, you think, \"You know, that's when he was just starting out\" . . . and that's kind of exciting when you catch people early on or, you know, if you go to a diner and have a hamburger with Jason Reitman and he's doing his second film, Juno, and you have no idea what's in store for him. Talking to Jane Fonda and sort of studying her complexion. You know, the thing about movie stars that is really interesting when you talk to them, is that in person their beauty\u2014or lack of it\u2014you can't really disguise it in person. You see the person, you know? I don't think I was ever so star-struck by anybody as Gregory Peck.\n\nQ:Really?\n\nA: Just because he was sort of an icon for movies of my youth. And most of all I wasn't expecting much when I walked in. It wasn't, \"Oh, wow, Gregory,\" but the charisma of the guy just bowled me over, I thought, \"Wow, this is a real movie star.\"\n\nQ:That's lovely.\n\nA: Jessica Lange, back in the day, thinking this is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.\n\nQ:Wow.\n\nA: Madonna, not so hot.\n\nQ:Really? Wow! Wow! Incredible. You heard it here first! I read about, in this book, a place\u2014was it called Heaven? An after-hours sort of disco club that everyone frequented and anything happened and everything did happen and was encouraged to happen. Did anything happen there for you?\n\nA: No, nothing happened. I didn't go to Heaven.\n\nQ:You didn't?\n\nA: I didn't die and go to Heaven, I didn't live and go to Heaven. No, you know, a lot of the festival lore I feel I kind of missed out on.\n\nQ: You were working.\n\nA: And, you know, films get out late, and what are you going to do with Robert De Niro and, you know, Martin Scorcese . . . and it was a time in the film industry where the whole thing was kind of a river of sex and cocaine, you know? So I didn't actually take part in that, you know? I mean, I was in a band at the time, in a different kind of world, but that sort of champagne-and-limousine world . . . escaped me.\n\nQ:It's for the best.\n\nA: Yeah, for the best.\n\nQ:Professional through and through.\n\nA: Well, no, just missing out, I think. Just missing out on it, you know? Yeah, the parties, the parties. And it used to be I would go to a lot of TIFF parties, but now who's got the time, you know? The TIFF schedule is so insane you spend all your time chasing films and interviews and you drop into a party to grab a bite or get a drink or talk to someone . . .but it's definitely the TIFF industrial complex now, it's not as festive a festival as it once was just because it's not so local, it's not so homey, it doesn't really belong to us anymore, it belongs to the world, for better or worse.\n\nQ:I want to ask one more question, if there's something that you're excited to see.\n\nA: Yeah, I think The Master, which is\u2026 I think everybody's excited to see The Master because it comes from Paul Thomas Anderson\u2014Magnolia, etc.\u2014because it stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, and because it is about\u2014or not about, depending who you listen to\u2014Ron L. Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, and the trailer looks great. So that's one we're all dying to see. I'm kind of dying to see the De Palma movie. I mean, De Palma . . . with Rachel McAdams in it. I'm also dying to see the Terrence Malick film, also with Rachel McAdams. So there's those, and there's a lot of good films at TIFF that I've already seen, you know, at Cannes, including Michael Haneke's Amour and The Hunt, a Danish film. There's lots of stuff. You know, it's funny, TIFF gets obscured by the celebrity glitz but the fact is there's still a bedrock of world cinema there that's there for the taking for those who want to expend the incredible energy it takes to actually navigate this festival.\n\nQ:Do you ever get sick of movies?\n\nA: I get sick of bad movies, and the majority of them are not great, but you never get sick of good movies. And whenever you see a really good movie it's like, \"What was I thinking? \" You start to sort of give the benefit of the doubt to kind of okay and mediocre stuff, and then something blows you out of the water and you say, \"Wait a minute, that's why we're here. That's why we care,\" you know? So you never get sick of the good stuff.\n\n500 Days of Summer: This is the one with that anime-eyed chick who has the indie-pop duo, right? And the whole movie is pretty much just her being super mean to some guy for a year and a half? And the title comes from the character being named \"Summer\", which should have been a dead giveaway to her boyfriend that she was a narcissist raised by obnoxious people?\n\nAn Education: I'm guessing the working title was A Pedo-cation. The \"-cation\" is short for \"hour-and-a-half vacation in a movie theatre that's probably not gonna be crowded at all\".\n\nThe Hurt Locker: Whoa, wait, I actually saw this one! Protip: it's the same old buddy-cop movie, only in Iraq. [NOTE: REVIEW IS NOT IRONIC]\n\nInglourious Basterds: I was going to make the standard cheap joke about how Quentin found a way to make Hogan's Heroes look relatively tasteful, but then I remembered that nobody under 80 really has any business questioning the tastefulness of Hogan's Heroes (several of those cast members ran from the Nazis or risked death fighting them or both; the guy who played LeBeau was in Buchenwald). I find myself wondering if maybe QT did us a favour by bringing WW2 back within range of a purely artistic treatment. I'm actually going to watch this later today, so pretty soon I'll be entitled to an opinion!\n\nInvictus: Am I the only one who literally couldn't believe this is the first time Morgan Freeman has played Mandela in a movie?\n\nThe Messenger: Outstanding year for Woody Harrelson, with Zombieland, Defendor, and now this. It's not even a comeback\u2014he's always popping up in cool stuff, even though he's got that Skoal-stuffed Kallikak face and gives every indication away from the set that he started life with an IQ of 80 and gave away about a sawbuck of that smoking the chronic. This is a guy who spoke the following words about making this very movie: \"It made me care about the soldiers. Prior to that it wasn't that I didn't care about them, I just thought of them and the war as all the same thing.\" And yet here we are, legitimately wondering: great American actor, or greatEST American actor?\n\nA Serious Man: Do you figure the Coen Brothers realize we've all figured out which ones to skip and which ones to go see? Given the pattern of their career, you can actually catch yourself thinking \"God, it's almost like they're two different people.\" Just fire the Hudsucker Proxy one and keep the Fargo one already!\n\nStar Trek: My hypothesis about the Disney-Marvel deal was that comic books don't need to be profitable because they've become storytelling R&D labs for the movies. This is confirmed here by the use of the time-honoured \"retcon\" strategy as a means of breathing life into an effed-out bunch of characters we could otherwise hardly stand the sight of.\n\nUp: Let you in on a secret: I've never really liked, as in really really really liked, a Pixar movie. I find even the good ones a little bit sterile and contrived. Which, obviously, they are, but that doesn't stop other people from flipping out about how deep the philosophy of The Incredibles was or how Ratatouille was pretty well the equal of anything Kubrick ever did. The emperor has no clothes, guys! Most celebrities are terrible at voice acting, most of these movies have Kricfalusi's Cal Arts disease in the worst way, and we should be way past having \"Ooh, cool\" reactions to nerdy little touches in CGI animation! Plus, shame on anybody who fell for the 3-D thing. You're, what, the fifth or sixth generation of audiences to fall for this crap?\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are: I didn't think it was possible for any literary work to attain a higher exegesis-to-original-text ratio than either the New Testament or Shakespeare, but Sendak proved us all wrong.\n\nTonight I had a beer with Germany's biggest box office star. I was introducded to Til Schweiger at a small, jammed party for TIFF's gala premiere of Phantom Pain (Phantomschmerz)\u2014a German movie inspired by the true story of a Canadian cyclist Mark Sumner, whose life was traumatically changed by a car accident. Til Schweiger has been called Germany's Brad Pitt. And he co-starred with Pitt, speaking English as one of his Nazi-scalping squad in Inglourious Basterds. But when I ask Schweiger about the comparison, after expressing his huge admiration for Pitt as an actor, he says, \"I'm not Germany's Brad Pitt; I'm Germany's Will Smith.\" (Given that Smith is Hollywood's biggest earner at the box office, the analogy makes sense.) Inglourious Basterds has been a massive hit in Germany, bigger than Pulp Fiction. But Schweiger told me he was furious that European countries chose to dub the film rather than subtitle it\u2014undermining the multilingual intrigue that serves as its central comic conceit. \"Here comes this guy who goes against all odds,\" says the actor. \"At the risk of alienating all the Americans, Quentin had everyone speak their own language, so you wouldn't have Germans speaking English to each other in a phony German accent.\" In his role as a German-American soldier, Schweiger naturally spoke English with his comrades. But for Germany's version of the film, he had to dub his English lines into German. \"The German audience knows me as a native German speaker. And when I'm in an international film speaking English it's a different timing, a different rhythm. Then I dub it into German, and the German audience wonders, 'why does he talk like this?' \"\n\nWhen Schweiger asked me what I thought of Phantom Pain, I confessed I had to work late and missed the premiere but planned to catch it in a repeat screening. He said he appreciated the honesty, then recalled an incident at a party where he caught someone's bluff. Once he was schmoozed by a producer who profusely congratulated him on his performance in a film that he didn't appear in, but was incorrectly listed on his IMDB page.\n\nThe director of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Kill Bill' once epitomized the future of moviemaking. But now he's mostly interested in movies of the past.\n\nIs Quentin Tarantino old-fashioned? There's a question you'd never have heard 15 years ago, when Pulp Fiction made him arguably the most famous and influential semi-independent filmmaker in America. But his new movie, the Second World War adventure Inglourious Basterds (opening Aug. 21), has the usually cocky Tarantino sounding insecure. Sebastian Haselbeck, founder of the Quentin Tarantino Archives website, told Maclean's that an important part of Tarantino's persona is \"enormous self-confidence in what he does,\" but far from sounding confident, Tarantino told the New York Times he rushed to get the film cut because he hasn't yet made a great film in the last 10 years: \"I wanted to have a masterpiece before the decade's out,\" he said. Still, he wouldn't say that Basterds would be it, only that \"this was the hardest movie I've ever made.\" Tarantino has also made some self-promotional comments that sound more like the brilliant, obnoxious media personality from the '90s, like his statement that he refuses to hire composers because he doesn't want a musician \"coming in here and throwing his s\u2013t over my movie.\" But he's increasingly acting like someone who doesn't want movie history to pass him by. Others think it already has: Gerald Peary, a critic who edited a book of interviews with Tarantino, now says, \"I don't find him as significant a cultural icon\" as he was in the Pulp Fiction days.\n\nAudiences don't always know what to make of Inglourious Basterds; the film got a mixed reception at the Cannes Festival (where Pulp Fiction took the top prize in 1994), and even favourable reviews warn that it's not the rollicking action-packed movie we'd expect from the trailers. Inglourious Basterds has all the things we've come to expect from Tarantino: horrifying but cartoonish violence, silly comedy in inappropriate places, sexy women out for revenge (M\u00e9lanie Laurent as a Jewish woman trying to destroy the Nazis in retaliation for killing her family). But it also has surprisingly little action for a movie about ragtag Nazi-killers who take their victims' scalps; two key scenes, the opening and a long one in a Paris tavern, consist of 20 minutes of dialogue followed by a few seconds of violence. And top-billed Brad Pitt, who plays the head Nazi-hunter, doesn't have much screen time in the movie; his character doesn't really drive the plot compared to the relatively unknown Christoph Waltz, who plays a charming but ruthless Nazi officer. Continue\u2026\n\nAt a festival loaded with heavyweight auteurs, and light on Hollywood celebrity, Brad Pitt was the designated superstar. But at the Cannes press conference for the premiere of Inglourious Basterds, he held off his entrance with noblesse oblige, and let his chuffed director, Quentin Tarantino, soak up the spotlight \u2014flanked by leading ladies Diane Kruger and M\u00e9lanie Laurent\n\nAnd you have to wonder, what deal with Brad's English garden-party get-up\u2014the cream jacket and the ascot-like scarf? All that's missing is a shooting stick. Did Angelina dress him in the morning as a joke? You'll notice, by the way, that in Cannes the press turn into fans in the presence of celebrity. Snapping photos I can understand\u2014everyone, myself included, wants visuals for their websites\u2014but the notion of journalists scrambling for autographs is downright embarrassing.\n\nAside from inventiveness with which filmmakers portrayed brutal violence, the other prevalent trend in Cannes this year was the camera's tendency to turn on itself. So many movies contained references to cinema, and quite a few had stories that revolved around a film within a film, or at least a show within a show\u2014notably Pedro Almodovar's Broken Embraces, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, Tsai-Ming Liang's Visage, Francis Ford Coppola's Tetro and Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. It makes you wonder if world cinema is fleeing the world, and happy to lose itself in its own reflection, like the characters who plunge through the funhouse mirror of Gilliam's Imaginarium. Quite the vicious circle. You've got several thousand film critics obsessively watching films that are obsessed with film. One of the French soldiers in Tarantino's movie is a film critic. And Isabel Coixet's Map of the Sounds of Tokyo drew a big laugh from a mass audience of critics with this line: \"How can you trust a guy who spends all day in a cinema?\" Precisely.\n\nIn this incestuous mix of art and life, nothing was spookier than seeing Heath Ledger's last performance in Imaginarium. His character makes his entrance dangling from a noose. And the film contains references to dead movie stars like Valentino and James Dean finding immortality on the silver screen\u2014allusions that now seem like morbid premonitions. But then movies lend themselves to meditations on mortality. And these days, when every auteur seems obsessed with the Death of Cinema, it was thrilling to see a film by an old man that celebrates its life\u2014Les Herbes Folles (Wild Grass), a gem by 86-year-old French master Alain Resnais, who's most famous for Hiroshima Mon Amour. Resnais's movie emerged as the festival's sleeper hit, and after catching up to it late in the week, I can see why.\n\nPlaying catch-up, I'm posting a bunch of blogs today, most written on the flight home. The festival officially ends with the awards Sunday, but by now it's effectively over, as all 20 features in competition have screened. Among the more high-minded entries, one of the favorites is The White Ribbon by Austrian director Michael Haneke. Set in a Protestant village in northern Germany on the eve of the First World War\u2014and shot in forbidding black-and-white\u2014it has the austere look and moral gravity of an Ingmar Bergman film. The village has become cursed by a contagion of strange and violent acts, beginning with the local doctor being thrown from his horse by a wire strung between two trees. A field of cabbage is chopped to bits. A retarded child is viciously mutilated. But there's also systemic abuse in this corrupt domain. Children are beaten, a daughter is molested, a midwife abused. So we assume the mysterious crimes are acts of punishment. Various patriarchs\u2014a baron, a steward, a pastor, and the doctor\u2014emerge like suspects in a Germanic game of Clue. As with Haneke's previous film, Cach\u00e9 (2007), this is a whodunit that's never clearly resolved. But with the children somehow implicated in a cycle of abuse and retribution, Haneke appears to hinting that these are the future architects of the Third Reich.\n\nQuentin Tarantino's, Inglourious Basterds (sic) is radically different from The White Ribbon, but it's another picture that doesn't exactly make one predisposed to love Germans. Tarantino concocts a Jewish revenge fantasy that rewrites history, immolating Nazis in an eye-for-an-eye conflagration, a mini-Holocaust. At the film's press conference, pulp filmmaker Eli Roth (Hostel), who plays one of the Tarantino's avenging \"basterds,\" gleefully called it \"kosher porn.\" Although Tarantino's fantasia exists in a world quite divorced from history, it makes flamboyantly explicit what is darkly implied in Haneke's film\u2014that the Nazis' crimes are rooted in some sort of original sin.\n\nYesterday was Brad Pitt Day in Cannes\u2014although hard-core cineastes, especially the Gallic variety, perhaps thought of it as Quentin Tarantino Day. And for die-hard Canadians, it was Mike Myers Day. In the biggest blitz of Hollywood talent that we've seen during the festival, all three were on hand for the premiere of Inglourious Basterds, Tarantino's outrageous Second World War epic. It was one of the most anticipated titles among the 20 films in competition here. The 2,300-seat Lumiere theatre was packed for the morning press screening, well before the 8:30 a.m. start time. And at the end of the two-and-half-hour opus, the Palais erupted with some of the strongest applause we've seen here. The movie is a hoot, and so was the press conference that immediately followed the morning screening. More on that in minute, but first a few details about the film"}
{"text":"Michael Caton-Jones\n\nThe British filmmaker reflects on his debut film, Scandal, 20 years after its original theatrical release.\n\nMichael Caton-Jones is one of the UK's best, and most unheralded, directors. Over a 20 year career, he has worked with the likes of Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis and a young Leonardo DiCaprio. His directing credits include Rob Roy, Memphis Belle, The Jackal, the singularly brilliant Basic Instinct 2 and the powerful portrait of the Rwandan genocide Shooting Dogs, which united him with John Hurt for what many consider to be one of his finest performances. Caton-Jones talks to Little White Lies about his controversial debut film, Scandal, the unique abilities of John Hurt, his hatred of the Thatcher government and why the closure of the UK Film Council as an 'unmitigated disaster' from a Government full of 'philistines'.\n\nLWLies: Watching Scandal today, what strikes you about it 20 years after making it?\n\nCaton-Jones: It strikes me as a really good piece of work, better than I thought. I look at a lot of films today, and there's a breadth to Scandal that seems to have evaporated in British films. It's about a lot of different things; it's emotional and it's classical, it's just quite a good film actually. I was surprised at how good it was.\n\nScandal is a film about a real life event that took place over a number of years. What kind of challenges did that pose as a dramatist?\n\nFirst you have to concentrate on the emotional pull of the story. You have a certain amount of recorded fact that you have to present but there were three different screenplays present at the point I joined the project. It was originally planned as a TV series rather than feature film. So my job was to try and create an architecture out of those, and develop a start, middle and end. At one point or another, I actually started to cheat on things. You can't be hamstrung by the weight of things that actually happened, it is more important to keep the spirit of what happened.\n\nIt's a sympathetic rendering of John Hurt's character, Stephen Ward. Was that a conscious decision?\n\nWhen I first came to it, the focus was on the pain and grief of the downfall of John Profumo. The scandal has his name, but it doesn't necessarily make him a central part of the drama. When I was researching the film, the more I read and the more I talked to people who were about at the time, and the more I found about it, the more outraged I got about the behaviour of these people towards this guy. He had been completely ostracised by people he called his friends, and we all know what it feels like to be let down by people. You're always looking to get your audience to empathise with your characters. But there was a lot going on behind the scenes, and you could attack the whole thing from a new angle by showing them something new, and by concentrating on someone the audience knew nothing about.\n\nYou've worked with John Hurt a number of times. What does he bring to the role as an actor, and why do you return to him again and again?\n\nWhat's great about John, and what isn't particularly obvious, is he probably the greatest actor we have. I've called him before probably the British De Niro. Physically or stylistically they are not the same, but one thing they do share is this complete bravery in how they attack a character. They are not afraid to do anything because they are searching for the truth. It's not about physicality or the voice or the surface stuff, it's inside the person. They are searching for honesty of behaviour, in its complexity. John's just the best in Britain that I know of and I've been lucky enough to work with. When I have a screenplay to work on, he is the first person I go to.\n\nThe film starts as a comment on gender, with Stephen Ward's sexuality left ambiguous. You get a much clearer sense of Joanne Whalley Kilmer's character. But as the film progresses, it becomes much more of a comment on class issues \u2013 the political class circling the wagons in self protectionism. Was that something you gleaned from the story?\n\nAbsolutely. We were quite aware of what we were doing. Scandal was made at the end of the Thatcher era and we were seriously fucked off with it. I feel the film is about hypocrisy which was rampant at that point. What I felt I was doing was looking at an example a few years earlier of what a certain type of person in a certain type of class or establishment were capable of doing and constantly doing it in the betrayal of people. I thought this was a good way of illustrating what we'd just been going through because I loathed the Thatcher administration with a vengeance, and I thought this was as good a way as any for a film maker to find out what was going on.\n\nDo you think it still has relevance today?\n\nIf you get an emotional honesty of the behaviour of the characters then it should resonate in 20 or 30 years time. If it's simply of the moment and of the fashion then it won't work in the future.\n\nConsidering Scandal was your first feature film, it is very nuanced and multivalent. How do you feel you have developed as a practitioner since making the film? Has your style changed radically?\n\nI think it has. When you start off you're full of vim and vigour. I just came out of film school and was versed in different styles of film making, so you kind of explode with all these different ideas. You try things out, and in some ways you're much braver. When you make more films you realise that what you are after is economy of expression. A lot of times when you start off, you're basically jacking off as a director. You're like 'Look at this cut, look at this tracking shot.' And once you've done that you realise your job is to be as invisible as possible and to make the story do the work and make the film simply happen, and a lot of it is about economy of expression. If you want a close up, you can dolly into the close up, or move the actor into the close up rather than cut to it. Interestingly it's kind of anti the modern way at the moment, a lot of directing is concerned with being seen and being noticed right now. It's a flamboyance rather than an invisibility.\n\nHow long do you think that compulsion to be flamboyant has been around for?\n\nI think its been there for 20 years. If you look at Paul Greengrass' films, no one else could make them. They're highly individual and highly stylised. There's a whole generation based on that scatter gun technique. There's a lot of handheld. It doesn't matter if it's in or out of focus. There's a lot of documentary montage. But I came up with a classicist view. If you come from Britain, you kind of come from the social realism tradition. That's just what you grow up with. I think it's to do with the lack of money that's now in the film industry.\n\nOn that point, obviously you'd only recently left film school when you got the Scandal gig, which has an amazing cast with John Hurt, Ian McKellen and Joanne Whalley Kilmer. It would be unusual for a young director to be given the same trust now. What's your assessment of the health of the industry, with the UKFC recently going under?\n\nWe're in a drastic state to be honest. Films like Scandal couldn't be made any more. There's a cultural chokehold. To make a film, you have to get money from the BBC, Channel 4, the UKFC or you need to go to the States. But for all these things, you need to make a certain type of film before they give you the money. So there's a cultural chokehold on what types of films can be made. By the same token, in comparison to the volume of films being made in the States, we only make a few. What is happening is there's less money, there's less variety and there's less opportunity.\n\nWith the UKFC being closed, the government are suggesting that film makers move into the private sector for funding. Is that going to exacerbate or help the problem?\n\nThe government haven't got a fucking clue what they are talking about. I think this is the most disastrous thing that could have happened. I'm not the biggest fan of the film council but I'll defend its right to exist. It just doesn't provide money for development, it looks after the exhibition side of things around the country. It strikes me as one of the biggest mistakes this mob have ever made.\n\nDespite its bloated beaurocracy, the UKFC was still at heart a redistributive body and it still provides people who aren't from London and who aren't rich an opportunity to make movies...\n\nThe Council kind of works, and the film industry kind of works. So if you get rid of it, you ask 'What are you going to replace it with?' It's stupid, and because they are philistines, and because they don't see film as an art, they just cut it. It's an unmitigated disaster.\n\nIf you could make one rule in the British film industry, what would it be?\n\nI'd lose all executive producers. The BBC is awash with executive producers, none of whom know what they're talking about. The director has been doing the producers job for decades, and now there is just another level of beaurocracy getting in the way. It's stopped directors doing their job because they have to defer to an exec producer, and they make soft films that are about compromise instead of a singular vision.\n\nWhat do you love about movies?\n\nMaking movies is the most fun you can have with your clothes on. I'm incredibly privileged to do this job. It's a really fantastic job, despite all the arseholes. And the fact is you end up with something that didn't exist, whether it is ugly, misshapen or beautiful. It's a fantastic job to create something that doesn't exist."}

That process continues to advance beyond early experiments like \"The Polar Express,\" and this majestic animal -- arguably the star of the film -- has an almost palpable warmth. You'd never guess that among his creators is the studio Rhythm and Hues, which also gave us the Geico gecko.\n\nPi Patel (played as a young man by Suraj Sharma, an appealing first-timer) calls the tiger Richard Parker (it's a clerical mix-up that stuck) and the two will soon become closely acquainted. After their cruise ship to America sinks in a massive storm, they must share a tiny lifeboat. What follows is a tale of bare-bones survival, but also Pi's attempt to find meaning and beauty beyond mere animal existence.\n\nDirected by Ang Lee (\"Brokeback Mountain\") and based on Yann Martel's novel, \"Life of Pi\" is an absolutely gorgeous movie, aglow with color and filled with wraparound 3-D effects. At times, though, the whimsical visuals trivialize the knotty parable at this film's center, which slowly emerges as an older Pi (Irrfan Khan) tells his unlikely story to an unnamed visitor (Rafe Spall). There are many mysteries here, but Lee seems unwilling to let them linger, preferring instead to wrap them up simply and sweetly.\n\n\"Life of Pi\" doesn't pack the cosmic punch it could. But it's wonderful to look at, and there's more to it than meets the eye."}

The SXSW Grand Jury gave special recognition for Nico Stone's performance in the movie. How did it feel when you heard about that?\n\nMatt Ruskin: Just being here was prize enough. Being recognized for an element of the film that we're really proud of was a huge honor and made it even more thrilling and exciting for us.\n\nPM: And he was such a big part of the movie that it must feel like it's not just his award, but a tribute to the film itself.\n\nMR: He did such a great job with it. It was his first time acting and he worked really really hard. We couldn't be more proud of the performance he gave so it's great that other people feel the same way.\n\nPM: What inspired you to make the movie?\n\nMR: We were lucky enough to know a lot of different kinds of people growing up. Some of that stuff is based on real events that happened, fictionalized into a feature film but also a story that we wanted to tell.\n\nPM: This movie was centered around one silent, but complicated character. Where did the character of Simon come from?\n\nMR: We wanted to do something set around crime and that genre in that world that we knew really well, in Boston. But what interested us in it was the human side of it, not trying to show thrill-seeking criminals trying to make that stuff look cool because we didn't have experiences with those kinds of people. There are people in really difficult situations not typically having fun. There's desperation and very difficult circumstances. We wanted to show the human side of that as best we could.\n\nPM: It did feel really gritty. The criminals in the film aren't looking for a big score. They're just trying to get by and not do much more than that.\n\nMR: Those are the kinds of people that we knew that inspired this story. We didn't know bank robbers that you see depicted in films. We saw a very different side of it. We thought that would be much more interesting and something we'd be much more capable of trying to depict in a film.\n\nPM: The film also has a unique ending that sets itself apart from other movies in this genre. Without spoiling it, tell me how you decided to end the movie the way you did.\n\nMR: Nico and I really collaborated on the script from day 1. One of the themes is that the kid can't escape who he is even though he may be the last person to realize it.\n\nPM: Finally, you guys grew up in Boston.

Speaking as a Red Sox fan, we'll always hold 2004 over New York Yankees fans.\n\nMR: I've gotten some reluctant congratulations in New York from unlikely people over the years.\n\nPM: Well congratulations on the movie and the award.

{"text":"I don't agree that it's essential to walk into the theater with a case history of the two characters to know that they're really screwed up people. Maybe the reviewer, who I like, needs his food cut for him before he eats, too. I didn't feel that Brandon's descent rang true, especially the fact that it was a bit homophobic to say that he's bottoming out if he needs to go to a gay bar to have anonymous sex.\n\n\"Since McQueen has told us so little about Brandon's or his sister's past, we have no insight into how the siblings turned out the way they did. It's empty sex for us, too.\"\n\nSuch backstories would have merely been easy explanations for a complex psychological disorder, and it would have made it far easier for the viewers to distance themselves from what is to a large part a societal problem, I'm thus glad that McQueen only alluded to it. As far as I'm concerned the actual weakness of \"Shame\" is that the film gets over the top in the second half and tries to force its message upon the viewer which wasn't really necessary anymore at that point. The scene mentioned by Jirin above was one of the reasons it ultimately lost some of its impact and relevance.\n\nNo one sees the film less as an 'addiction' film and more of a deconstruction of a greed, sex obsessed culture in the guise of the new 'upwardly mobile youth' genre?\nMaybe it's that I'm of the post-2000's generation and spent essentially every one of my years in school around guys that believe the only true goals in life are attaining exorbitant wealth and notches on one's bedpost\u2026\n\nThe answer for contrivance is found there. That the only manner in which the stereotype of the \"ultimate male\" can breakdown is in homophobia and contrivance. As if the only true statement ending McQueen could make was to show a man so empty, useless and infantile in his disposition to the world that the only manner in which he can react to it is in total cliche. You may have been rolling your eyes, I was laughing.\n\nThe biggest problem that I have with this movie is that he's so uninteresting that the movie seems to take a backseat too in an effort to keep him like so. The character was well-acted by the always-reliable Fassbender, but other than that, I didn't find anything there is to dig.\n\nShame isn't that bad, but everyone here is right: it's a brave move making a movie about sex addiction but it doesn't mean you have to be boring too\u2026\n\nSantino\n\nabout 1 year ago\n\nWhoa. I wish I could be bored by a movie like this. I was both riveted and emotionally devastated by this story and by this character in particular. Of course the flawlessness of the technical aspects of the film left me in awe too but after Hunger, we expected that from McQueen. But the story itself, that's what really hit close to home; not the specifics of sexual addiction but just the obsession this character is trapped in and his dysfunction towards intimacy. I guess this is why I don't think of the film as simply about a sex addict \u2013 to me the behavior and emotion is about so much more; about a broken character. I've certainly known my fair share of people like Brandon and Sissy.\n\n_As far as I'm concerned the actual weakness of \"Shame\" is that the film gets over the top in the second half and tries to force its message upon the viewer which wasn't really necessary anymore at that point. _\n\nI'm curious to hear what you thought the message was.\n\n@Jirin\n\nI saw Shame as more of a by the numbers addiction film, which happened to have scenes of explicit sex.\n\nI didn't really see think this was about addiction (let alone sex addiction), but a film about sin and guilt and the isolating effect of both. (I know Santino thinks I'm crazy but I see this almost as secular Bad Lieutenant. Instead of God, Sissy's love is what offers redemption for Brandon.)\n\n@Wu\n\nNo one sees the film less as an 'addiction' film and more of a deconstruction of a greed, sex obsessed culture in the guise of the new 'upwardly mobile youth' genre?\n\nDo you mean the film critiques the materialism\/greed of upwardly mobile youth? I didn't read the film that way, but I'd be interested in hearing a case for this.\n\nHe has the addiction in the beginning of the film. He has it in the end.\nHe gets rid of the paraphernalia associated with it in the middle (which is done by addicts ALL the time).\nHe deftly avoids responsibility at work for his addiction.\nHis \"truest\"\/cliched moment of pain is not related to the addiction, but to his sister.\nAnd his most revealing emotional moment happens in the instance of sexual failure, which points to an issue outside of addiction (it would be comparable to an alcoholic being unable to get drunk after a trauma).\n\nThus, his descent, at least sexually isn't a descent at all, as he doesn't resolve the addiction or even face it. Any addict recovery group will tell you your bottom isn't going to be doing the exact same thing at the end as you were in the beginning (i.e. checking out married women on the subway).\n\nSo the film is not about addiction.\n\nSo, what it is about? Outside of a sexual addiction, what is this character?\nA young, rich, greedy, superficial wall street kid with deep-seeded familial issues. So, the film is either about family issues or his socioeconomic status.\n\n.\n\nThus, the contrivance. He feels, really, really feels, when his position is threatened. But reacts with utter bullshit around \"true\" emotions of \"real\" people.\n\nHe's an archetype, playing an archetype. He is Gordon Gecko. He thinks he's Hamlet.\nThus, the deconstruction isn't of addiction, or family, but of the need to attain wealth.\n\nHis true descent is about fear of losing one's status; the ability to be a functioning sexual addict with horrendous familial issues and have it not matter because society sees the pure, unadulterated accumulation of money as the only measurement of health; not being confronted with real human problems and needing to solve them.\n\nA young, rich, greedy, superficial wall street kid with deep-seeded familial issues. So, the film is either about family issues or his socioeconomic status.\n\nWell, I think there's a third option\u2014namely, the film is about guilt and sin and being trapped by both. We all have demons within, skeletons in our closet that we're really scared to reveal (well, most of us are really scared to reveal these things). I suspect we try to ignore or hide from these dark parts of ourselves, but we can't escape them. I think the film is about this and offers a possible salvation for this.\n\nThe only true moments of dread in the film are the confrontation in the office with the woman he failed to perform for and his boss' confrontation about his computer's harddrive.\n\n.\n\nSimilarly, with his hardrive, I don't think he's worried about losing his job so much as his addiction being revealed. His fear lies in other people finding out about this dark part of him. (Hence the title, Shame.)\n\n and emotional.\n\nFinally, I don't get the sense at all that Brandon really cares much about his job, status or his wealth. His apartment is pretty simple and spare. It doesn't look like a status seeking individual. His clothes or the way he talks doesn't indicate that he's greedy or superficial, either, imo. There's two things that stand out with Brandon: he has this insatiable libido and he's filled with fear. He's trapped and this feeling, along with his sex drive, is what dominates his life.\n\nSantino\n\nabout 1 year ago\n\n@ Jazz -Yes.\n\n\"Similarly, with his hardrive, I don't think he's worried about losing his job so much as his addiction being revealed. \"\n\nYes.\n\n\"(Hence the title, Shame.)\"\" and emotional.\"\n\nI don't think Brandon was that concerned about losing his job. I think he was freaked out about Sissy having sex with his boss because it does bring her closer to his world. I think probably in the past it was easy for him to control these two worlds and to keep them separate. Clearly Sissy comes from that part of Brandon that is eating himself up. Clearly she has her own issues. She mentions they had a messed up childhood; I think they both come from a dark place and it's just manifesting itself differently in Brandon than in Sissy. However I don't think Brandon is jealous or envious of her being able to have a \"normal\" relationship. I think she is just as messed up (she's just dealing with it in a different way). No, I think it's much more of a control thing with Brandon \u2013 it's like now that she's here, staying with him, he's in less control of his obsession. He can't masturbate freely, he can't watch his porn whenever he wants, he can't have people over. Also\"Well, I think there's a third option\u2014namely, the film is about guilt and sin and being trapped by both.\"\n\nHis only sin, at least as he sees, is his loss of control.In the next scene she's seen giggling with a co-worker.\nHis power is taken away by his inability to control her.\n\nHe takes her aside and tells her not to hurt his position. To keep her mouth shut (literally), as it were.\n\nThe reaction, almost immediately, of anger and not shame; as in, \"she took this from me,\" not \"why can't I do this? what is wrong with me\"; is the giveaway that it's not about anonymity or emotion (he knows and likes the webcam performers on his computer, for whatever that is worth). It's about power, particularly about the power afforded him in his work being taken from him.\n\nWith his sister and his job, the same thing.\n\nHow does he react when they have sex in his apartment?\nHe leaves. Avoids it. It's an aggravation, to be ignored.\n\nHow does he react when she calls his boss? When she gets attached (by the way, sleeping with a married man with kids\u2026 is that a more \"normal\" relationship?), what does he do?\nHeAnd watch the manner in which the scene with the computer is shot. We're completely aware of what the confrontation is about, he isn't. ButIt's not the fear of being found out. It's the fear of losing what one has acquired if they're found out. Status.\n\nP.S. \u2013 His apartment doesn't scream minimalism to you? It's one of the most pretentious apartments I've ever seen (and I'm using the word correctly, here).I don't disagree with this\u2014but from the very beginning of the film, Brandon seems very fearful, almost mousy; a man who is holding a lot in and hiding something. (I got this sense when he's at the bar and with his co-workers.)\n\nClearly Sissy comes from that part of Brandon that is eating himself up. Clearly she has her own issues.\n\nWhat do you think her issues are? She seems capable of intimate relationships\u2014or at least she can deal with her emotions and darker aspects of herself and past. Yet, she's broken and messed up, which translates to not being able to do responsible things like get and hold a job. (I'm thinking out loud here.) On the other hand, Brandon'a inability to deal with his emotions\u2014his ability to bury them\u2014seems to allow him to not only take care of his responsibilities, but do so rather successfully.\n\n_However I don't think Brandon is jealous or envious of her being able to have a \"normal\" relationship. I think she is just as messed up (she's just dealing with it in a different way). _\n\nRight. I'm not saying Brandon is jealous, per se. She.\n\nNo, I think it's much more of a control thing with Brandon \u2013 it's like now that she's here, staying with him, he's in less control of his obsession.\n\nI think there could be some of that, but don't you think Sissy's presence scares Brandon because she seems more open to her past and the dark parts of herself. If Brandon isn't willing or unable to confront these aspects of himself, Sissy can be really threatening and dangerous presence, I think\u2014she could either openly talk about these things, which would push him in that direction or her presence might remind of his inability to deal with these dark parts of himself.\n\nAlsoI wondered if they had an incestuous relationship in the past, but I never considered if he had those feelings in the present (not that I considered seriously), but you could be right. I also don't find that reading really compelling, though. I don't think the details of the past are so important. What's closer to the heart of the film is his fear and inability to confront this fear, as well as his isolation and inabilty to deal with emotions and develop intimate relationships.\n\n\".\"\n\nTrue@Jazz: When talking about a \"message\" I basically refer to what McQueen wanted to convey about (any kind of) addiction and its social context as he stated in this interview.\n\nWhen I say the film is about sin and guilt, I mean that Brandon's sex addition represents the demons\/skeletons we all have. What his specific \"sin\" is isn't so important, imo. Basically, it's something dark and distasteful and something he's ashamed of and that's what's important\u2014at least to the reading I'm offering.\n\nIn the next scene she's seen giggling with a co-worker. His power is taken away by his inability to control her. He takes her aside and tells her not to hurt his position. To keep her mouth shut (literally), as it were.The reaction, almost immediately, of anger and not shame; as in, \"she took this from me,\" not \"why can't I do this? what is wrong with me\"; is the giveaway that it's not about anonymity or emotion\u2026\n\nThis^ scene happens right after the failed sex scene with the black co-worker? Man, I don't remember this scene at all. But how does this prove that he's greedy and materialistic? In his interactions, he doesn't seem to be power hungry or status-oriented at all.\n\nHow does he react when they have sex in his apartment? He leaves. Avoids it. It's an aggravation, to be ignored.\n\nBut how does this prove he's power hungry or greedy? I think he's aggravated because she's invaded his space, and she's able to enjoy sex. (If I recall correctly, Brandon never seems to enjoy sex in any of the scenes. In fact, he seems desperate and in pain.)\n\nHow does he react when she calls his boss? When she gets attached (by the way, sleeping with a married man with kids\u2026 is that a more \"normal\" relationship?), what does he do? HeThis is the strongest evidence that he's worried about his job\u2014but not necessarily concerned with status. But, imo, he really doesn't seem to care about status or money. What other parts in the film indicate that Brandon is greedy and status-oriented?\n\nAs for \"destroying her,\" I explain this by his feeling of resentment towards her ability to enjoy sex and the fact that she's bringing this into his bed, no less. Moreover, if he does feel threatened by her (for the reasons I mentioned earlier), then this could also explain his hostility.\n\nAs for the \"normal relationship,\" I just mean that she can enjoy sex with someone she likes\u2014something that Brandon doesn't seem able to do.\n\nButSee, I don't think the boss blaming the intern would neccessarily would immediately allay all of Brandon's fear of being discovered. The fact is, he had been caught, but he was lucky that the boss blames someone else (and does the boss really think this? He might wonder about this and maybe only later feel assured that this was the case.)\n\nP.S. \u2013 His apartment doesn't scream minimalism to you? It's one of the most pretentious apartments I've ever seen (and I'm using the word correctly, here).\n\nI'm not a hip on interior design, but the apartment seemed pretty plain and non-descript\u2014not minimal in a modern, hip way. It seemed like the person living there really didn't care much about how his place looked except for cleanliness.\n\n\"But how does this prove that he's greedy and materialistic?\"\nIt challenges his status. He has no control over her.\n\n\"But how does this prove he's power hungry or greedy?\"\nIt challenges his status. He has no control over either of them.\n\n\"This is the strongest evidence that he's worried about his job\u2014but not necessarily concerned with status.\"\nNow it's your job to show how they're unrelated.\n\n\"See, I don't think the boss blaming the intern would neccessarily would immediately allay all of Brandon's fear of being discovered.\"\nNo, it wouldn't (hence, why I stated that the blaming of the intern didn't allay his fear in the least). Because even if he's not blamed for the act, he's responsible for it, nonetheless. Hence, his status is challenged. Or\u2026\n\"It's not the fear of being found out. It's the fear of losing what one has acquired if they're found out. Status.\"\n\n\"I'm not a hip on interior design\u2026\"\nHence, the included links. Here, and example of the architectural principle. Here, a still from the film.\n\nApu said, TrueThat's a good point about using the affair as a pretext to push Sissy away\u2014both physically (out of the apartment) and emotionally.\n\nThe other thing I wanted to add was that Sissy was suicidal\u2014and that seemed related to her\/their dark past. She also seems to really need and want her brother\u2014to be near and close to him, partly as a way to deal with all of the pain. If that's true, and Brandon can't deal with emotions, intimacy and his demons, then Sissy would be really threatening to him. I also get the sense that the only way he can protect himself from Sissy is to keep her physically out of his life\u2014that if she's in his life, he will crack\u2014i.e., become intimate, have to confront his demons, etc.\n\n\"I don't know how people could be blown away by Shame. It's such a vague, thinly-drawn film that I'd hesitate to even call it a character study. It has almost no meat on it's bones. It's a half-baked idea made into a feature length film. It hardly explored sex addiction or it's characters or their relationships in a deep or insightful way. In addition to this, it relentlessly insists on it's own importance, but has nothing to back it up or justify the heavy-handed approach. Fassbender's and Mulligan's performances belonged in a much better film and honestly, they are the only two reasons to give this film a look in my opinion.\"\n\nSo when you say \"status,\" you mean power status, not social status; likewise, \"greedy\" refers to power, not wealth?\n\nNow it's your job to show how they're unrelated.\n\nI assume you agree that one can be concerned about losing a job without being power hungry or status oriented, right? Moreover, I've offered other possible reasons for his reaction to Sissy sleeping with his boss (and Apu offered another). Finally, I see very little in the film that shows Brandon as power hungry or materialistic. He doesn't treat people badly or condescendingly. He doesn't dress in a flashy way, as if to impress or show-off. He's pretty quiet and mousy\u2014and his clothes is nice, but not flashy.\n\nHence, the included links.\n\nSo what made you so sure I wouldn't be hip? :) lol\n\nOK, I know what you're talking about. I'm not sure if the lobby was really modern, but the apartment complex he lives in is nice, but I was mainly thinking about his actual apartment. It's very plain\u2014and not in the hip, modern way, if I recall correctly.\n\nSantino\n\nabout 1 year ago\n\n@Jazz -\n\n\"What do you think her issues are? She seems capable of intimate relationships\u2014or at least she can deal with her emotions and darker aspects of herself and past. \"\n\nI don't know that I would say she is capable of intimate relationships. Just because she deals with her issues in a different way from Brandon doesn't mean she doesn't have the same issues. You know what I mean? Let me put it another way \u2013 let's say you have two siblings who were both molested as children. When they grow up, one of them acts out and have lots of meaningless sex and is very promiscuous. The other one is very withdrawn and is incapable of being physically close to anyone. Both of them have deep-seeded self esteem issues and can't connect to people on an emotional level. Yet these issues manifest themselves differently \u2013 one sibling has lots of sex and the other has none. This is a completely over-simplified example but my point here is that Sissy says \"We had a fucked up childhood\" (or something to that effect) and that partly hints at why they are both are exhibiting destructive behavior as adults. Sissy obviously has issues and on the surface, it actually looks like Brandon is the one that has it together (he's got a stable job, a place to live, etc.). But of course we as an audience know that everything isn't as it appears.\n\n\"She.\"\n\nI don't think he sees her as being able to do something that he can't (or have something that he can't). If anything, I got the sense that he feels bad for her and whatever issues he's dealing with, Sissy's are much worse and he needs to put his issues aside to help his sister. If he was resentful towards her, he wouldn't have let her stay there. Why would he allow her to rub it in his face?\n\n\"I think there could be some of that, but don't you think Sissy's presence scares Brandon because she seems more open to her past and the dark parts of herself.\"\n\nI agree with this. I think this dovetails into what I was saying about how they manifest their issues. Sissy is much more upfront about her issues whereas Brandon is much more introverted, trying to hide his \"shame\". Sissy doesn't seem to give a shit that she appears to be a mess. I wonder if some of this stems from Brandon being the older sibling and feeling like he has to be a \"father figure\" and not show weakness. I don't know but certainly his inability to deal with his emotions and her being pretty open to her emotions are stereotypical of men and women in general. On the surface, she seems more fucked up but the reality is that she might be able to survive her issues (assuming she can survive the suicide attempts) whereas Brandon's repression and denial of his issues might ultimately destroy him.\n\n\"I don't think the details of the past are so important. What's closer to the heart of the film is his fear and inability to confront this fear, as well as his isolation and inabilty to deal with emotions and develop intimate relationships.\"\n\nI think you are right. I don't think it matters the specifics of their backstory and I don't think it's about incest. I think the film is about fear and his inability to deal with his emotions and specifically develop intimate relationships with people.\n\n\"I assume you agree that one can be concerned about losing a job without being power hungry or status oriented, right?\"\n\nNot if you're rich.\n[Hence, the desire to be rich and the even more fervent desire to keep what one has when they have more than enough of it.]\n\n\"So when you say 'status,' you mean power status, not social status; likewise, 'greedy' refers to power, not wealth?\"\"I'm not sure if the lobby was really modern, but the apartment complex he lives in is nice, but I was mainly thinking about his actual apartment. It's very plain\u2014and not in the hip, modern way, if I recall correctly.\"\n\nRich people may not be as concerned with losing their job as non-rich people, but that doesn't mean they don't care about losing their job\u2014i.e., getting fire. There are non-economic reasons for not wanting to be fired\u2014e.g., liking the job, not wanting to be embarrassed, etc.So you don't mean social status, but self-worth? a sense of importance? I don't think Brandon's finds that in his wealth, his job or sex. I don't think Brandon has much status\u2014or he doesn't value himself very much\u2014he seems pretty unhappy and sex or power doesn't seem to be helping much.\n\nI don't see the film about being rich at all. Are you sure your perception isn't being influenced by a personal axe you have to grind?\n\nRich people have a lot to worry about from losing their job too. Sure, they have more savings and can last longer before finding another, but higher end jobs are harder to get, especially if you're fired in a disgraceful way. Yeah, he is scared of losing his status, but not in an 'alpha male' sort of way, and so does anybody, rich or poor.\n\nI do see the film as being about sex addiction, as his addiction is what keeps him from forming a true emotional bond with anyone. The reason he couldn't have sex with his coworker is that he only likes sex when it's dirty and sinful, he can't get into it when it's dignified and personal. He loves his sister, but as long as she's around and parading around casually naked in front of him he's tempted to make advances on her, and that makes her unable to form a real bond with the only person in the world who depends on him.\n\nHe tries very hard to keep his impulses compartmentalized from what he considers the real, important part of his life, and keeps finding them bleed in, and hates his inability to control himself.\n\nSantino\n\nabout 1 year ago\n\n@ Jazz -\n\n\"I also get the sense that the only way he can protect himself from Sissy is to keep her physically out of his life\"_\n\nYes. She is vocalizing, externalizing their problems. She is bringing it to the surface. He is trying to squelch it; suppress it.\n\n\"It's very plain\u2014and not in the hip, modern way, if I recall correctly.\""}
{"text":"'Contagion' reminds us to wash our hands\n\nTodd Miller | Collegio Writer\n\nI went into this movie expecting it to be lame, unrealistic and full of unneeded, voiceless montages. I was happily surprised that it was much better than expected. Plus, it had only two unneeded, voiceless montages.\n\nContagion\n\nThe film is about a new virus breaking out in spots around the globe, and continuing to spread worldwide. The virus spreads and kills quickly while disease researchers around the world work to stop the epidemic.\nOne problem in the film is the six subplots, meaning there are a lot of characters and story lines to follow. A couple of times I saw a character who had previously been introduced, but I'd forgotten completely who they were. I wasn't able to remember the names of most of the characters. Trying to fit so much into a two-hour film meant each subplot suffered. None was quite fully developed, and half were left without conclusive endings.\nOne plot follows a Dr. Cheever (Laurence Fishburne), who works at the Centers for Disease Control. He has to protect the reputation of the CDC during the epidemic, while trying not to use his knowledge of the disease to protect the people he knows and loves. His personal plot wasn't all that involved or developed, so he is little more than a side character most of the time.\nThere are two subplots that are entirely similar, and would be continuous if not done by two characters. The first follows CDC agent Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet) as she tries to find out where the virus came from, and trying to treat and quarantine infected patients. A similar plot develops later when Dr. Hextall (Jennifer Ehle), tries to create a vaccine for the disease. However, her character seems to come out of nowher\n\ne.\nAnother subplot involves Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon). Emhoff is the husband of Patient Zero, Beth Emhoff, who died along with their son. After learning he has immunity to the disease, he spends the entirety of the film trying to keep his teenage daughter (Anna Jacoby-Heron) from becoming infected. Despite people dying around the world, all his daughter thinks of is her social life and spending time with her boyfriend. However, I can't tell if that part of her character is terrible or realistic.\nAlan Krumwiede (Jude Law) is a conspiracy blogger who quickly jumps onto the story of the disease. He claims the disease can be easily cured, but the government is working with pharmaceutical companies to make money on the cure they produce, and urges people not to take it. Krumweide's plot confused me at times. At first, it seemed he was honestly on to something and trying to help people, but other times it seemed he was just trying to get people's attention, earning him more money somehow. This was one of the plots left unresolved, so I don't really know what it was about. Krumwiede didn't play a major part in the main plot (finding a cure), so the movie would've been the same if we didn't see his portion.\nThe last plot is the story of Carrie Anne (Grace Rex), an official from the Geneva World Health Organization who goes to Hong Kong in search of the disease's origin. That's all I can say without spoiling the rest of her story. This subplot suffers the most and disappears for about an hour of the film. I nearly forgot she existed until she reappeared again. Like Krumwiede's portion, the plot wouldn't have suffered if she hadn't been mentioned at all.\nThe film would have been stronger if it better focused on such stories, rather than unneeded montages of the science behind the virus. The film tried too hard to show both, rather than focusing on one portion.\nOverall, this decent film spread itself too thin. If you can get past the paranoia of getting a disease after seeing the movie, I'd say it's worth watching."}
{"text":"Wall\n\nI'd have to say \"Daisy Kenyon\" qualifies as a failure as a melodrama since I rarely felt empathy for the cast of characters. Rather than becoming emotionally involved, I felt as though I was the detached witness to a petty universe of self-absorbed people as they lurched from one interpersonal meltdown to the next. And yet those are the very same reasons why \"Daisy Kenyon\" still feels particularly modern. The main cast is excellent, especially Dana Andrews as a slick bastard who by comparison makes Don Draper look like a paragon of chivalrous virtue. It's telling that the narrative never seems to lose its sympathy for his character despite the horrid things he does, most likely because he represents the definition of success in America circa 1947."}
{"text":"Tagore's Char Adhyay is a very complex novel and the dialogues sometimes get slightly discursive, so it's not so easy to interpret in cinema. But he (Bappaditya Bandopadhyay) did it very intelligently. He didn't want to tell a complex story in a linear form, rather he has put Ela (Paoli Dam) in different situations so that's why, though the film begins from the end (in the text), you don't feel uncomfortable. It is not pronounced, it's quite cinematic. It's like a rondo in a music piece where you come back to the tonic.\n\nI don't know if people would be able to understand the dialogues now. Bengali language-er charcha toh komey gachhey. But I am sure there is an audience. When I made Moner Manush, a lot of people had told me that the audience wouldn't understand the philosophical dialogues, but that didn't happen. People understood and they connect if they want to.\n\nThere's riddle, irony and metaphor in Tagore's dialogues that are sometimes difficult to transcreate in spoken words but Bappaditya has tried to keep the original dialogues, the original lines from the text. That's why I liked it.\n\nA lot of people may question what had happened to Ela's parents (played by Dipankar De and Srilekha Mukherjee) suddenly because after a point they are not there in the film. I don't think a director should always follow the typical style of storytelling where you have to show everything. That's why I thought that the film is like a musical movement.\n\nAnother thing which I really liked is that the film had a very limited budget but within that, art director Goutam Basu has done a very, very good job. It's minimalist. They selected a few spots, like the bank of the Ganges and only one or two other spots that have been recreated. I liked that minimalism. There's a small party sequence \u2014 now party sequences are never very good in Bengali films, I am sorry to say this \u2014 that is very well done.\n\nI also liked the scenes where Ela is drenched in the rain. It's like a leitmotif; it appears many times in the film. What I am trying to say is that the film has a style.\n\nPaoli as Ela is quite convincing, but I've told her that her make-up is a little inconsistent. Her skin tone changes in a couple of scenes. Otherwise her Ela is very good, and so are the other actors. The young guy who plays Atin (Vikram) is good. He has suited the role very well. Indraneil's is a very complex character (Indranath) and he is good in it. Actually, through this character, Tagore wanted to say rebel-der moddhey real thirst-takotota chhilo and romanticism kotota chhilo, so that aspect has come out in Indraneil's character.\n\nThe background score (by Gaurab Chatterjee)is also quite good. But I told the director (Bappaditya) that there are too many songs in the film. He could have given just the mukhra, the antara wasn't required. Because of the songs, the film drags a bit. Today people prefer fast-paced films, a few scenes are a bit repetitive. See, the concept of slow and fast in cinema is very relative. The whole mindset of the audience has changed because of television and the MTV culture, so people want something to happen all the time. So people may find the film slow. But the Tagorean world didn't have a pace like ours, so how could he make it fast? I didn't find it slow, frankly speaking.\n\nIt's a good effort, a good attempt. Visually, Elar Char Adhyay is good.\n\n(As told to Kushali Nag)\nWhat did you like\/dislike about Elar Char Adhyay? Tell t2@abp.in')+]"}
{"text":"HATRED AND LOVE FOR THE CITY\n\nRobert De Niro's legendary performance of Travis Bickle is what makes Taxi Driver as good as it is. The performance is unparallel to anything he or anyone else has ever done, and it's done so powerfully and truthfully that in some aspects we feel we can relate to this odd character. Prior to filming, De Niro worked as a taxi driver and studied mental illness in preparation for the role, and if that isn't a sign of dedication to acting then I don't know what it. In more recent years, De Niro has had a hit and miss collection of films mainly but no matter what he'll never be forgotten for his portrayal of this tortured, lonely and macabre Vietnam war veteran.\n\nMartin Scorsese's direction is also as fierce as it has ever been and is likely to ever be again. Just simply through the camera angles he uses, particularly in the scene where Travis Bickle seeks redemption from Betsy after their bad date. The camera gently moves along the corridor and then just stops. Just for that brief moment, we feel Bickle's pain and love even without seeing anything other than two walls and a closed door.\nOne of the most recognisable parts of the film is the famous \"You Talking To Me?\" sequence is also of the strongest parts. Just those four words et us in on the future of the film, with only those subtle four words. Subtleness is a common theme in Scorsese's heart-breaking masterpiece that is Taxi Driver.\n\nThe screenplay especially is nothing but incredible. The funny thing is that it's so thin and seemingly undercalculated, but it also says so much as the same time that is speaks out to it's audience in the most unlikely way possible.\n\nNow, that conclusion. That conclusion is brilliant. It's sort of a three part sequence. The usual shootout, which is done in terrifying fashion and it also appears that there's a more dormant and dark feel to the whole scene. Then it moves on to the letter. Now, this is where it gets really good. It's often criticised but also praised for not having a definitive answer or meaning to it. It's either a fantasy of Bickle's or it's actual reality and as simple as that may seem, it's not. There are parts in the film when you're damn sure it's reality, but then there are the most unspecific details that persuade you over the dream part of the argument. The third part features Betsy in Travis' taxi and this is the exact part that I mean. With all the recognition apparently showered on Bickle by the news and the locals, it could be believed that this is reality and Betsy has seen that Travis has a thicker heart to save young prostitutes from an inevitable death rather than to take girls out on dates to see porno flicks.\n\nBut in all truth, it doesn't matter what the actual ending is. It's part of the film's mystery and it's darkness and we all know by now that Scorsese's pictures aren't out to have a definitive meaning but to be ambigious and keep the audience thinking. A similar device in utilised in the latter pairing of De Niro and Scorsese in the 1983 The King of Comedy."}

It could've starred a Bronson, Seagal, or Stallone, if it had been shot in the United States. Instead, it's a dubbed over film that finds Vinnie Jones headlining, but he's merely an assassin-for-hire in the third act. What we've got here is an above average film starring Aitzhanov Berik, who turns in a decent performance as the brooding bodyguard Arsen who is searching for his brother's killers.\n\nThe first thirty minutes almost lost me. Everything moved predictably, to the point of being paint-by-numbers. But Berik's material as Arsen and the bit about the \"judges\" who speak to him, pushing him toward vengeance, finally sucked me in. Berik tracks down his brother's killers, finds out that it's a conspiracy involving the journalist's investigation into the mob, and proceeds to attract a good amount of trouble. The fight scenes are entertaining, but the supporting actors, outside of Berik and a fellow reporter, aren't very good.\n\nUltimately, the \"twist\" is pretty ridiculous, but it reinforces the questions about vengeance that come to mind about a film like this. How much does seeking vengeance cost the seeker? What are we sacrificing in ourselves when we take the law into our own hands? If \"vengeance is mine, says the Lord\" is true, why would God not want us to take vengeance?

{"text":"\"Happiness is in the little things.\" Summer of Giacomoportrays the warmth of a summer day, the cool water of a flowing river and the company of a teenage friend.\n\nIn addition to the innocent beginnings of love, the audience also experiences the progression of these feelings into the desire for more. Filmmakers often seek to capture passionate physical love rather than the yearning it stems from. In his film,director Alessandro Comodin captures this desire perfectly through candid interaction with a handheld camera.\n\nThe film is set over the course of a relaxed summer in Italy. Nineteen-year-old Giacomo Zulian and his friend Stefania Comodin spend their days together swimming in the blue water of a river hidden in the forest. They fight, flirt, laugh, have picnics and nap on the riverbank.\n\nGiacomo has recently undergone cochlear implant surgery allowing him to experience sound for the first time. The director explained in a Q & A after the film that he initially intended to capture Giacomo's metamorphosis from being deaf to being able to hear. He spent over two years filming his friend Giacomo but admitted that he didn't discover much. So the film became a documentation of Giacomo's summer with his friend Stefania, Comodin's younger sister.\n\nEnglish subtitles accompany the Italian dialogue of the teenagers. It's not your typical documentary filled with interviews and archival footage. Rather, it is a combination of long and short shots of the two on a single handheld camera. Alessandro explained that there was no script, no schedule, just a lot of waiting. He wanted to give his audience moments of reality that make the film and characters so relatable.\n\nThe handheld camera succeeds in this and allows for close-up and personal recording as well as long shots. The director doubled as the videographer and captured the intimacy between the teens while also giving them space to interact freely.\n\nGiacomo is energetic and full of life. His character brings an enjoyable humor to the film that is truly entertaining. In contrast, Stefania is quieter and more reserved, perhaps because her brother is filming her. Nonetheless, it is clear that the two develop some sort of love for each other over the course of the summer. The space between them lessens when they dance, hug, swim and caress each other. The teenage desire for adventure and passion lingers in the air.\n\nOverall the film does take a bit of patience, but an interesting twist near the end makes the wait worthwhile. The director also explained that he meant to leave some things open to the interpretation of his audience. His work is part fiction but the characters are real. The film is slightly staged in that he sends teenagers out to spend time together. It is a real documentary in that all of their interaction is candid. This is something that makes the film interesting because it combines a movie theater escape with a real-life documentary feel."}

{"text":"Turning Hugo Into a Yugo\n\nMoviemakers have been making themselves miserable wrestling with Les Miserables for almost ninety years. The very first American feature film was a 1909 silent adaptation of Victor Hugo's dark masterpiece, and it's been reprised on the screen at least half a dozen times since then. Most memorable? The 1935 version, with Frederic March and Charles Laughton, and the 1957 French edition, starring Jean Gabin and Bernard Blier.\n\nThrow in that kitschy stage musical Americans love so much, the highly derivative TV series The Fugitive and the two recent movies it begat, and you've got a major industry in reformed convicts and obsessive cops.\n\nThe Danish director Bille August (Pelle the Conqueror), whose films move more slowly than French justice itself, probably won't be remembered for his take on what every dewy-eyed matinee-goer now calls \"Lay Miz.\" And Hugo, the towering romantic who wasn't around to spend the royalties from the dozens of movies inspired by Les Miserables and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, probably isn't turning cartwheels in literary heaven this week. Despite the best efforts of Schindler's List hero Liam Neeson as the beleaguered Jean Valjean and less effective ones of Shine's Geoffrey Rush as the implacable Inspector Javert, this is a pretty tedious hunk o' Hugo. And novelist Rafael Yglesias has yielded to the basest temptations. What we have here is much less a tale of justice and redemption in nineteenth-century France than the love story of two good-looking kids, one of whom just happens to be M. Valjean's adopted daughter.\n\nIn other words, the greatest figure in French literature has been \"Titanicized.\" The rising sap in lovely Cosette (Claire Danes) and her pop-revolutionary boyfriend, Marius (Hans Matheson), takes center stage here. Forget the Battle of Waterloo; it no longer exists. Hugo's famous chase through the Paris sewers? It's been trimmed and rewritten to suit this year's fashion. As for the novelist's central conflict between authoritarian moralism and social justice, it's been relegated to the back table of the cafe so August can gaze upon young love in bloom.\n\nThis is, of course, the dictatorship of the marketplace. The bulk of the contemporary movie audience is 17.3 years old--something like that--and the moguls know that audience refuses to digest anything like the world's most famous shipwreck or the contemplation of the nature of freedom unless it's been so dumbed down and softened up by soap opera that the original event or source is unrecognizable.\n\nAugust and Yglesias defend their choice in regard to this diminished and demeaned Les Miserables by saying that Hugo's turbulent novel is so enormous and unwieldy that they had to cut out something. Well, what they've cut out is the heart of the matter--like excising the whale from Moby Dick. What they've left is petty, pretty romance. Cosette and Marius don't attain the age of lust until halfway through these agonizing two hours, but once they do, Neeson and Rush may as well cease to exist. What do trifles like restoring the Republic or contemplating the birth of European fascism in the procedure-ridden soul of Javert matter when young romantics have a misty rendezvous to keep at midnight?\n\nHey, this author and director can't even get Valjean's sentence for nipping the loaf of bread straight. That's supposed to be five years' hard labor in the quarries of Toulon, guys, then nineteen more in the galleys."}

Arthur and Franz concoct a plan to steal the money, and convince Odile to help them.\n\nWhy I Love It:\n\nLike Godard's \"Breathless,\" the exhilarating \"Outsiders\" is one of the director's most accessible and enjoyable outings from the 1960s. Part buddy film, part crime-gone-wrong drama, it tells the story of three disaffected friends whose ill-advised adventure in armed robbery is really a way for Godard to capture their devil-may-care youthfulness. Tracking the trio's romp through the Louvre (to beat the nine-minute record of an American tourist!) or staging a cool, dazzling three-way dance (the Madison) next to a caf\u00e9 jukebox, Godard is at his most invigorating here. In all, \"Outsiders\" is atmospheric, free-spirited, and fun."}
{"text":"What's the story?\n\n\"Fast\" Eddie Felsen (Paul Newman) is a pool hustler. He and his partner, Charlie, go into pool halls and set the local players up. Eddie's dream is to beat the legendary Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), so he challenges him to a contest. After more than 24 hours, Eddie realizes he can't win. He leaves Charlie the money and the car, and goes off on his own. Eddie meets Sarah (Piper Laurie), an alcoholic, and moves in with her. Eddie struggles with his identity in more than a few ways, but grows closer to Sarah. He teams up with gambler Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), who sets up a game with a rich man. In a mirror image of the game with Fats, Eddie loses at first, and then, defying Sarah's appeal to quit, persists, and wins $12,000. In the tug-of-war for Eddie, Bert has won, and Sarah commits suicide. In a new frame of mind, Eddie decides to challenge Fats to a game again.\n\nIs it any good?\n\nDespite the seedy settings (so evocative that they are almost a character in the story), this is almost a traditional morality play about humility and redemption. In the beginning Eddie is, as Fats notes, as fast as his nickname, slick, cocky, superficial. He wants to win for the kick of it. But inside him, there is someone who wants to win for the beauty of the game, and the honor of doing something surpassingly well. But before he can be a real winner, he must get rid of the part of himself that wants to lose, that is afraid to take a real risk. For that, he has to experience real loss, especially the loss of Sarah.\n\nAs Nietzsche said, \"That which does not defeat me makes me stronger.\" Eddie is strengthened so by these experiences and by what he has learned, that he can no longer be contained by what had once been his entire world. Bert's threat that he will no longer be able to play big-time pool is meaningless to him. Even if Bert had offered him a 50-50 deal, he would not have taken it. That world is too small and self- contained for him now in this movie have different ideas about what makes someone a winner or a loser. What are those ideas? How do they fit with others you have heard about, or with your own? What made Eddie different between his two games with Fats? Why didn't Sarah want Eddie to keep playing Findlay?

{"text":"It takes a while to sort out and piece together the parts in Seven Pounds. And though it all makes sense by the film's end, the process can be slow going.\n\nA romantic mystery of sorts, Seven Pounds re-teams Will Smith and director Gabriele Muccino, who worked on 2006's The Pursuit of Happyness.\n\nNot much can be revealed about the movie without spoiling the surprises. But we can say that Ben, Smith's enigmatic character, begins by compiling a list of seven names. What each has in common is a critical need for help. Ben comes to their aid in extraordinary and dramatic ways.\n\nWhy he has chosen to help them is initially murky. The process of sussing out the source of his altruism could try some people's patience. Moments of confusion arise as the story ricochets between past and present and among the cast of characters. Still, it is an engrossing, if plodding, tale of redemption and sacrifice.\n\nThe film opens intriguingly with Ben calling 911 to report a suicide, his voice an odd blend of distress and matter-of-factness. The plot takes turns in various directions, building up to the crucial matter of the suicide.\n\nOne of the people Ben helps is Emily (Rosario Dawson), an easygoing, artsy woman with whom he slowly falls in love. Dawson and Smith have an appealing chemistry. None of the other story lines are as involving, particularly one involving Ezra (Woody Harrelson), a good-natured pianist. Ben initially derides the man, who has a day job in sales, as \"a blind vegan beef salesman.\" His chunk of the story could definitely have used some beefing up.\n\nSmith gives an understated performance. He's less the genial Everyman of his comic films and more of a brooding, lost soul. He may be driven mostly by guilt, rather than generosity.\n\nSeven Pounds is the kind of holiday film that seems perfectly suited to these economic times, with desperate people in dire need of cash, medical intervention and proper housing, and a conflicted hero who decides almost grimly to improve their circumstances. Concerned with how people overcome trauma and tragedy, the film focuses on universal themes of loss, forgiveness and redemption\n\nWhile it doesn't break any new ground or provide any revelations, Seven Pounds is unabashedly emotional and cautiously hopeful. It's the feel-good movie for these feel-bad times"}

That's why Sean Baker's \"Prince of Broadway\" is such a delight: like its subject, Lucky (Prince Adu), a silver-tongued street hustler, the movie is sharp, charismatic and so light on its feet we never know which way it will turn. An illegal immigrant from Ghana, Lucky entices bemused customers into a New York den of designer knockoffs owned by his Armenian boss, Levon (Karren Karagulian). Levon has a restless young wife and a heart-shaped birthmark on his cheek that doesn't lie: he's a generous crook with a soft spot for his scrabbling team.

{"text":"Wes Anderson films are not so much directed as curated. Often accused of being more interested in his props than his characters, Anderson's fussy, even obsessive focus on the objects and sets gives his films a missing the forest for the trees feeling that seems claustrophobic and frustratingly precious to some audiences and astutely ironic to others. Some, I think, see both.\n\nOn a fictional island called Penzance off the coast of mid-1960\u2032s New England, two middle school pre-teens run away partly to be together but mostly to be someplace different from where they were. Sam (Jared Gilman) is an owlish-looking orphan who escapes from \"Khaki Scout\" camp overseen by the very meticulous Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). He wears glasses and a coonskin cap. He lives with foster parents who have rejected him and, as we find, after camp is over he will be sent to live in an orphanage by a woman so odiously officious the only name she goes by is Social Services (Tilda Swinton).\n\nSuzy (Kara Hayward) is a serious and determined girl who lives with a family that does not appreciate or understand her. She wears knee socks, packs a record-player, and is very attached to her binoculars, which give her a chance to look at places far from home. Her mother (Frances McDormand) addresses her children in their home via megaphone. Sam first sees Suzy when she is in costume as a bird, about to appear in a performance of Benjamin Britten's opera about Noah and the flood. They engage in a secret correspondence and make plans for their getaway.\n\nSam and Suzy create a world for themselves that is part fantasy, part very real. They are practical, if limited, in their understanding of their situation. Sam uses his camping skills to provide food and shelter, and they rename their site Moonrise Kingdom, establishing themselves as rulers of a place that exists in the opposite of the harsh daylight of their previous reality. They try some kissing but sleep next to each other in complete innocence. Suzy brought a record-player as one of her essentials, and they listen to music.\n\nMeanwhile, Scout Master Ward, Suzy's parents, and the local sheriff (Bruce Willis), who is having a joyless affair with Suzy's mother, are searching the island for the missing children. Sam, who was ostracized for being weird by the other scouts, becomes a hero for his daring and romantic adventure and they help him try to escape with the assistance of another Scout leader (Jason Schwartzman) who is less upstanding than Ward. Even Ward ends up complimenting Sam on his \"commendable\" campsite.\n\nSam and Suzy may not have a plan for taking care of themselves past a few days and one of the things Anderson does best is conveying that exact moment between the end of childhood and the beginning of adolescence (Suzy's home is called \"Summer's End\") when things are animated by imagination that can feel completely real. Like Peter Pan and Wendy, Sam pretends to smoke a pipe and Suzy presides over a group of Lost Boys to create a family that allows them to be both adult and forever young. Like the young heroes of Dickens' story about Mr. and Mrs. Harry Walmers, Jr., the young runaways seem to have an almost incantatory faith in the power of marriage to create a bond that will protect them from the power of the grown-ups.\n\nIn many ways Sam and Suzy are more adult than the grown-ups around them, who are petty, foolish, or lonely. And, as usual in Wes Anderson films, they are not as fully realized as the props and settings around them. It is telling that the children assume a paper mache decoy will fool the adults; it almost does. Suzy's library books in particular are a marvel of period detail, so vivid and evocative audiences of a certain age will swear they had those books on the shelf next to Madeleine L'Engle and Norton Juster. It's details like the coonskin cap that delight his fans and infuriate everyone else. No one in the mid-60\u2032s and no 12 year old of any era wore a coonskin cap. The omniscient \"Our Town\"-style narrator (Bob Balaban) can tell us a storm is coming but he cannot make the emotions of the story feel real or meaningful.\n\nParents should know that this film includes some sexual references and experimentation by middle-schoolers, teen and adult smoking and drinking, some strong language, some violence, and human and animal characters peril and injury.\n\nFamily discussion: Why did the scoutmaster change his mind about which was his \"real job?\" Why did the children run away? How does it change the story to have it set in the 1960's instead of today"}
{"text":"Movie Review: Unfaithfully Yours\n\nWhile trying to explain the type of film we were about to watch to my in-laws, my wife said it was a Rex Harrison film. I immediately began thinking that I would explain that it was a Preston Sturges film, starring Rex Harrison. Not really much difference there, when you think about it, especially since the in-laws have probably never heard of Preston Sturges, not being much for film watching.\n\nIt's not that they are opposed to film, but rather they don't ever go to watch movies, being too expensive, or read up on them, or study weekend grosses or any such thing. They don't really go to rent them either. They are just not that type of folk. They are pretty simple country folk, and don't get caught up in those things.\n\nI mean they still watch regular TV, no cable or satellite, still use the Internet via a dial-up. They only have a DVD player because I bought them one, and only then because I was tired of watching the same old VHS tapes when we came down. And that's just it, when we come down we watch movies, and they enjoy them. So, they aren't opposed to movie watching, they just don't go about seeking them out.\n\nAnyway, I would have said it was a Preston Sturges film, because when I think about film I think more about directors than stars. Directors, it seems to me, have more effect on the final outcome of a film than an actor. If I had to choose, I'd go for a film with a bad actor and a great director, rather than a great actor and bad director. Odds are a director can elevate a bad actor's performance, more than an actor will elevate bad direction.\n\nArticle comments\n\nPreston Sturges rules.

{"text":"A remarkably moving, emotionally absorbing work of cinema.\nIt puts one in thrall early on, creating suspense and worry about characters whose lives you care about. All this is accomplished by the director and cast without bombast or manipulation but with subtle artistry. The sounds and cinematography serve the story masterfully and reward the viewer with a cinematic treasure to take home and savor for weeks, possibly forever.\n\n\"Barbara\" was remarkable. I'm reminded of the manner in which Castro's secret police controls Cuban citizens. Sure, the setting is tropical. But the oppression and big brother's watchful eye is no less stark. I only wish people understood the sort of touristic apartheid that exists on the island before they utter silly condescending insensitive comments about Cubans happily playing their drums.\nplaying their drums. How condescending and revolting is that, hmmm?\n\n\"The Lives of Others\" was a remarkable movie. \"Barbara\" is a poor attempt to touch a similar subject . This movie with its obvious plot seems never to end. Besides showing, in the 1980, socialist concentration camps in East Germany is a simple exaggeration.\n\n\"Barbara\" is a movie where the eyes have it, and the tensions\u2014personal and political\u2014are both pushed along and softened by the landscape. The quiet terror in \"Barbara\" is like a set of differential equations where the need for freedom is gradually tweaked by a growing empathy, and the arc of Barbara's longing slides toward an ironic life-affirming resolution that rings true in its ambiguity. Although there is no quick fix any more in her situation\u2014she gave that away to some one else\u2014there is the reality of her profession and its hold on her which may provide Barbara a possible redemption from the degradations of a monstrous Police State.

Can you really start falling in love with a colleague who you know is informing on you?\n5. Why wouldn't you leave East Germany when you could and then try to help others get out too?\n\nThis was a slow and slightly off-putting film that was nevertheless sort of interesting.

{"text":"Movie Reviews\n\nConnecting \"The Bourne Legacy\" so closely to its predecessors is both its greatest strength and liability.\n\nBecause while the other \"Bourne\" films were intensely focused on its titular character, it was clear there was a lot going on behind the scenes and in other sectors of the government related to the Treadstone project that birthed Matt Damon's character. \"Legacy\" does a solid job of justifying the existence of this side story, though the story of Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) can never seem to quite escape the shadow of Bourne.\n\nAaron Cross is a member of Operation: Outcome, one of the CIA's many black ops programs that, while not directly affiliated with the Treadstone project, it's definitely been shaped based on the results of it. Outcome, however, isn't solely focused on creating the ultimate operative, it's out to find ways it can make any person an operative. Thanks to medically-induced viral infections and gene therapy by way of medicinal intake, Outcome wants to physically and mentally enhance its agents' capacity to do their job. Cross is one of several guinea pigs who were poked, prodded and medicated in the hopes of turning them into a more realistic version of Captain America.\n\nHowever, once Bourne begins exposing the men and women behind the curtain of Treadstone, the CIA becomes desperate to cover the tracks that lead to these other programs, forcing Cross to run for his life, as well as seek out one of the scientists, Marta Shearing (Rachel Weiss), who helped make him what he is. Because while the physical enhancements were made permanent thanks to a specially tailored viral infection, the mental enhancements still require daily pill ingestions to keep the subjects at their mental peak. Get off the regimen and the subjects regress.\n\nIn other words, \"The Bourne Legacy\" is the most action-packed adaptation of \"Flowers For Algernon\" that you'll likely ever watch. That said, it's impressive that they managed to take a concept like gene therapy and pharmaceutical enhancements and make it seem plausible and fitting.\n\nThere are a couple problems with the film, the biggest is that it feels too short in terms of overall story. The first third or so of \"Legacy\" is spent establishing its connections to the \"Bourne\" universe, but also trying to set it apart. It feels as though writer\/director Tony Gilroy felt too skittish about trying to give the audience a new character that ultimately has little to do with the film's namesake and so went overboard in trying to sell the audience on the need to see this particular story.\n\nThe result is what ends up feeling like an overly long prologue, so long that by the time the film cuts to credits it feels like the story proper has only just found its legs. There's practically no resolution to the story at hand. I understand the desire to leave things open-ended, but this all but stops the story dead in its tracks before things come to any sort of satisfying conclusion.\n\nThe other problem is the fact that Cross is less substantial a character than Bourne. One of the best things the previous films accomplished was so thoroughly placing us in Bourne's corner and getting us inside his head. Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass' films provided an excellent sense of just how thoroughly Jason Bourne had been put through the ringer mentally, physically and morally. There's not really any of that in play here. There's no sense of Cross' history as an agent, what (if any) sort of missions he went on. There's lots of talk about how an Outcome agent will perform within the morally reprehensible but necessary grey areas of governance and warfare, but we never see or get any sort of sense of what Aaron has been forced to carry out.\n\nStill, it's a testament to director Tony Gilroy and to Renner that I enjoyed this despite those rather glaring, unavoidable flaws. Renner manages to carry the character even though he seems to have very little to lose in the grand scheme. (Sorry, I have little sympathy for a black ops guy being hunted, that just seems like an occupational hazard when you sign on for that sort of work.)\n\n\"Flawed\" but still enjoyable seems to be the wheelhouse Gilroy works from when it comes to his directorial efforts as it's more or less precisely how you can describe \"Michael Clayton\" and \"Duplicity.\"\n\nWhat leaves me most curious is where the franchise goes from here. (And one can only assume that's the intent. Like the film's tagline, \"there was never just one\" when it comes to action films of this sort.) Where Cross is left once the credits roll, there's very little in the way of obstacles left for him. Who knows.\n\nRegardless, this may not have been the overall best way to have shifted the franchise onto another rail, but it's solid enough in what it does accomplish. Gilroy, at the very least, shows he can direct engaging action, so let's hope that we can get a little more meat on the story now that we don't have an extended prologue to tread through."}
{"text":"Review: 'Windtalkers' flat, by-the-book war movie\n\nWoo's, Cage's pyrotechnics overwhelm film\n\nBy Paul Tatara CNN Reviewer\n\n(CNN) --Now that a new age of warfare is upon us, so is a new age of war movies. Hollywood has yet to release any battle films that were made after the sad awakening of September 11, but the pictures that were kicked into development by \"Saving Private Ryan's\" success are establishing new boundaries for onscreen violence.\n\n\"Windtalkers\" is a textbook World War II melodrama with enough carnage to convince the \"Black Hawk Down\" crowd that it's an unflinching depiction of real combat. Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. But no amount of burning, blasting, stabbing, and shooting can hide a weak script.\n\nThis is supposed to be the story of Pvt. Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), one of the many Navajo radio operators who relayed combat instructions during World War II, via a code that was based on their native language. The enemy never managed to break the code -- Japan and Germany had no Navajos -- but that didn't stop them from torturing any apparent American Indians they captured to see if they'd spit out the answers.\n\nSo Yahzee is teamed up with Sgt. Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage), a physically and spiritually wounded combat veteran whose mission is to protect Yahzee ... or to kill him, if it looks like he's about to fall into enemy hands.\n\nMissing the point\n\nThat could have been a pretty good movie, but the screenplay, by John Rice and Joe Batteer, is quickly victimized by a common Hollywood back-pedal: It mostly ignores the minority figure in favor of focusing on a white guy.\n\nThis pivotal misstep can also be traced to the fact that Cage, for whatever reason, is a big movie star, while Beach is a relative newcomer. And you don't gamble with such an expensive picture.\n\nThe result is a wishy-washy storyline that feints toward importance while settling for blood-and-guts and a string of \"war is hell\" clich\u00e9s. Some of these scenes would make John Wayne blush. Woo breaks out the been-there-done-that early on, when we see Enders receiving the head wound that will torture him throughout the picture. When one of his men dies in his arms, Cage plaintively screams \"Noooooooo!\" before he, too, is taken out by a grenade. It's hard to be moved when you're so busy giggling.\n\nThat's just the beginning, though. Yahzee is written as a near-saint who, until cornered, gently sidesteps the racism provided by the vicious hick in the platoon. His quiet Navajo buddy, Pvt. Whitehorse (Roger Willie), on the other hand, occupies his time by playing tunes on his flute, which enables him to forge a Special Interracial Bond with harmonica-playing Sgt. Henderson (Christian Slater, but it could have been anybody for all he's asked to do).\n\nThere's also the usual scene where the guys talk about their unique plans for making a fortune when they \"get outta here.\" This leads to Slater's character ruminating for an entire sentence over how he's hoping to sell a newfangled product called \"yogurt\" once he gets home. Don't ask me.\n\nNo emotion\n\nOther characters include a gruff, by-the-books officer (Peter Stormare) and a pretty young nurse (Frances O'Connor) who falls for Enders when he's in the hospital. It should come as no surprise that they warm to each other the night before Enders is shipped off to hell in the South Pacific, or that he's haunted by horrifying flashbacks at every turn.\n\nAnd then there's Cage's by-now requisite histrionic performance. Though Enders is supposed to be haunted by the men he lost in that early battle, his bulging eyes and toothy snarl look exactly like Nic Cage trying desperately to convince us that he's a killing machine.\n\nIt's no secret by now that Woo can orchestrate a complex action scene like nobody's business. But you don't really sense any fear or anguish in these men because everything about the movie, aside from the flying body parts, is cartoonish.\n\nA master of pulp -- and Woo made some terrifically compelling action pictures when he was still in Hong Kong -- should stick with what he knows best. If there's too much weight to the subject matter, the whole thing sinks in the blood.\n\n\"Windtalkers\" contains bad language and as broad an assortment of violence as you can imagine. It isn't lingered over, but you have to leave the theater to avoid it. This one is a missed opportunity, which places it a step above most pictures nowadays, where there's basically no opportunity at all."}
{"text":"Magic Trip Review\n\nReleased\n\nDirected By\n\nStarring\n\nScore\n\nCaptivating, but one can't shake that nagging feeling that self-indulgence is afoot.\n\nEffectively a collage of footage shot by author Ken Kesey during one of his many psychedelic excursions across America with Neal Cassady and their band of Merry Pranksters in the mid-1960s, Magic Trip serves as a fitting homage to an era immortalised by its legendary drug culture.\n\nFilmed on their travels over the years, with little purpose other than to chronicle their acid-fuelled journey, Kesey and his friends amassed hours of footage. Despite botched attempts to edit the tapes by the pranksters themselves, the footage had remained largely unedited and otherwise forgotten until 2005 when director Alex Gibney happened upon and decided to resurrect them for a modern audience.\n\nHere, pieced together for the first time by Gibney and editing partner Alison Ellwood, Kesey's home videos are meticulously reconstructed and combined with a plethora of archive materials, ranging from audio recordings of Kesey's first dalliance with acid, radio interviews and reconstructions of transcripts from the pranksters themselves. All these elements combine to provide a vivid picture of an America all but lost to the passing of time.\n\nToday, Kesey's images take on a whole new meaning, providing a unique glimpse of 1960s drug-addled America for a very different generation but while Gibney's fascination with the subject is plain to see, it's often jarringly apparent that the film is tailored to a far more niche audience than it initially lets on.\n\nStanley Tucci's voiceover narration cleverly links together audio snippets in the style of a radio interview, but these occasional moments of exposition do little to provide much-needed historical context for the uninitiated.\n\nContextual gripes aside, however, there's no disputing that Gibney and Ellwood's agonising reconstruction of the tapes makes for a compelling and unparalleled insight in to a period of American history a period long since passed, but never forgotten. The real question is whether or not anyone below a certain age is likely to care.\n\nAnticipation\n\nA visual insight in to a strangely elusive part of the American Dream.\n\n4\n\nEnjoyment\n\nCaptivating, but one can't shake that nagging feeling that self-indulgence is afoot.\n\n3\n\nIn Retrospect\n\nRegularly fascinating, but often somewhat inaccessible in its lack of historical context for the uninitiated."}

The last one was \" Solutions locales pour un d\u00e9sordre global \" really interesting\n\nDenis:\nOne of not so famous and IMHO very underrated movies is a 1996 French film \"La belle Verte\" directed by Coline Serreau (she also plays the lead character of the movie). The movie was supposedly banned by EU.\n\nReview from IMDB:\n\n--- Quote ---Did you ever wonder why the floors under your feet , in the place where you live are covered with a gray material, & you can't see the soil? Why this floor is full of poo? Why there are boxes of metal emitting gases that you must breathe? Why you live in high cages, forced to hear the noise of these metal boxes? Why you're driving them, & not using your feet, causing you to eventually have heart attack, if you won't die earlier from cancer from the gases, or an accident with the fast moving boxes? Why you eat corpses of animals? Why you use pieces of paper entitling you to any value, without which you won't have nothing, not even food? Why you eat unhealthy food? Why you're sitting every evening watching a box showing people telling lies, & dirtying your mind? Why do you let yourself be led by fat selfish people caring only about themselves, their money & power, why don't we really listen to each other, talk to each other, why do we have these hierarchies, in which the most stupid, incapable ones rule, control & exploit the goodness & capable weaker ones? Why we go about doing wrong immoral things just because we're being told, why are we constantly mad, worried & frustrated with such small trivial things, like a scratch on the mirror of our cars, & never see, appreciate & thank the beautiful wonderful life, nature & world that surrounds & supports us? Why we ruin the world, poison ourselves, live in ugliness, support the rich selfish people exploiting us, selling us lies, tobbacco, weapons & arms, killing people with the money that we're forced to pay them as taxes?\n\nIf you haven't wondered on all this, its because you're like an ant, small cell in the super-organism, & can't see beyond your cell's vision. What you need is to be disconnected, shocked by artists such as Coline Serreau, that have a vision that you don't have, consciousness, different from that of the ants. Such artists, like Jesus & Johann Sebastian Bach, cause the world to change, the super-organism to evolve into something more intelligent, more good for its cells, that are given life. --- End quote ---\n\n\n\nDenis:\nOh, I apologize... Here's a brief description (synopsis) of the movie: As part of an intergalactic coalition, a well-meaning space alien volunteers to bring a message of self-actualization and harmony with nature to the one planet rejected by all her peers as incorrigible--Earth.\n\nThis family-oriented French sci-fi comedy chronicles her adventures on the chaotic planet. Mila is 150 years old and has five children; encoded in her brain are two telepathic programs designed to restructure the thinking of destructive humans. The first is a fairly mild program designed to inspire the humans to rethink their world and begin asking some difficult questions. The other is far stronger and rapidly indoctrinates subjects with lofty utopian ideals and makes them deeply aware of themselves.\n\nMila lands in Paris and is unnoticed but for the sudden, inexplicable power surges and outages that occur whenever she sends a telepathic message to her alien cohorts. Instead of eating, Mila draws energy from holding newborn babies.\n\nIt is while holding an orphan infant in an obstetrics ward that her Earthly troubles begin. Feeling deeply for the baby's plight, she confronts the ward's head doctor and when logic fails, looses her programs upon him. Instantly the unsympathetic brute sees the light and begins helping her save the babe from wicked welfare workers."}

Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) finds himself whisked to Vatican City, where a murderous, scientifically threatening, religiously confounding conspiracy is afoot. This is quite handy for Langdon, actually; he can't finish the book he's been working on without access to the Vatican archives\u2014access heretofore forbidden because, let's just say, there was some unpleasantness. (For reference, if not for pleasure, consult Howard's other film of Brown's other bestseller, The Da Vinci Code.)\n\nAnyway, the pope's dead, suddenly, and some of the cardinals in contention to replace him\u2014known collectively as the preferiti\u2014have been kidnapped. No ransom will suffice for their return, but how about some overdue props for the church's ancient rival, a science-minded and now highly psychopathic secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati? Their plan for the evening is to kill one of these cardinals every hour, and then use some anti-matter stolen from a Geneva supercollider to blow the Vatican up.\n\nAmbitious, isn't it? You'll forgive these Illuminati boys for being so proud of their plan that they just can't resist leaving a trail of ancient symbols and codes for Langdon to follow in order to defeat it. The code-breaking comes easily. It's the whole working with people thing that tends to hang Mr. Know-It-All up. These include Ayelet Zurer as an attractive but romantically neutral Italian particle physicist; Stellan Skarsgard as the officious head of the Swiss Guard; Armin Mueller-Stahl as a dodgy old cardinal; Nikolaj Lie Kaas as a ruthless assassin; and Ewan McGregor as the church camerlengo.\n\nYes, even during a deeply unsettling crisis, the affairs of the popeless Catholic Church will be entrusted to Renton from Trainspotting. Or, if you prefer, young Obi-Wan Kenobi. That's not so bad, is it?\n\nWell, you'll see.

{"text":"The title of Sunshine, a sci-fi thriller that marks the third collaboration of director Danny Boyle, writer Alex Garland, and producer Andrew Macdonald, is wonderfully misleading. The word \"sunshine\" suggests warmth, happiness, and comfort, but throughout the film it is intense, all-consuming, and potentially deadly. I cannot think of a film in which light itself, the very source of cinema, was such an inordinate force, often filling the screen and drowning out everything else. Yet, at the same time, the crux of the story is the necessity of that all-powerful light, which allows for human existence when it is abundant in just the right amounts. That which provides life can also incinerate it.\n\nThe story takes place some 50 years in the future when the sun has begun to die, which means that life on Earth will soon be extinguished by a solar winter. A spaceship named the Icarus II, which is protected by a giant reflective shield that looks like an enormous inverted umbrella, is traveling toward the sun with a payload of nuclear weapons that, when dropped into the dying star, will jump-start it back to life. That's the idea, anyway, which is borne out of a combination of complicated physics and simple hope. An earlier mission, launched seven years ago with the same goal, disappeared somewhere around Mercury and has not been heard from since.\n\nOn board the Icarus II is a multinational crew led by captain Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada). Among the crew is Capa (Cillian Murphy), the soft-spoken physicist who designed the payload; Corazon (Michelle Yeoh), the botanist who is responsible for maintaining a lush onboard garden that supplies them with oxygen for the years-long mission; Trey (Benedict Wong), a scientist who makes a fateful error from which he never recovers; Harvey (Troy Garity), a psychologist who is unnervingly intrigued by the effect the sun has on the human psyche the closer one gets to it; Mace (Chris Evan), the hotheaded communications offers; and Cassie (Rose Byrne), the sweet-natured navigator. The ship is overseen by Icarus, an artificial-intelligence computer (voiced by Chip Chung) whose mission-oriented programming sometimes conflicts with the crew's all-too-human decisions.\n\nThe mission runs into complications when they receive transmissions that appear to be coming from the previous expedition. Having been gone seven years, it is doubtful they could have all survived; however, a few of them may have, and the crew of the Icarus II most decide whether or not to go off-course and investigate or maintain their present heading. There are pros and cons of both choices, and one of the film's most satisfying elements is the way the characters work through their dilemmas rationally, taking into account the needs of the many (say, the entire population of Earth) with the needs of the precious few. When, the film asks, does a single human life become expendable?\n\nAlthough it was shot on a budget that probably wouldn't have paid for the catering table on the Transformers set, Boyle turns Sunshine into a visually striking film that uses the expected elements of the science fiction genre to create memorable, sometimes mesmerizing images. The early portions of the film are lyrical and often quiet, absorbed as they are in the vastness of space and the power of the universe. There have been so many movies set in outer space, but so few of them really capture what it would be like to be immersed in that endless black vacuum. Sunshine does so with great conviction.\n\nThe omnipresence of the sun, both visually and thematically, is the film's foundation, and light is manipulated every way imaginable. The crew of the Icarus II can see the sun safely from behind a protective filter that allows them to see only a fraction of the star's power, which provides an effective visual metaphor for the inherently miniscule place of human life in the cosmos. Yet, it is precisely human life that is at stake, and not just the main characters. Although we don't see Earth itself until the film's final frames, the continued existence of humankind is what truly hangs in the balance, which makes every action one of dire importance.\n\nIt is unfortunate, then, that the film starts coming apart at the seams in the final third as it sinks into horror-thriller territory. The lyricism of the film's early scenes give way to frantic violence, bleary visuals, and jagged editing, which is appropriate given the story's turn of events, but is not enthralling enough to disguise its derivative nature. This third-act development does have thematic significance in that it raises the question about humankind's role in the universe and whether a mission as audacious as jump-starting the sun qualifies as \"playing God.\" Unfortunately, it is done with such blunt-force trauma that it feels more like a bone thrown to the action-movie crowd than an organic and meaningful extension of the film's underlying issues."}

The plot is about an ex secret agent from Mossad now secretly controlled by the US government to perform illegal actions in defense of the \"American lifestyle\" and declaring he is OK to kill a few innocents when that is for the good of everybody else.

If you want to miss nothing you need a catheter Yesterday I got two autographs from NAKATA Hideo (director of Death Note movies) and YAMAZAKI Takashi (director of Always Sunset On Third Street). Stay tuned.\n\nDo you know that funny video out there on the Internet, where two guys play kung-fu style ping pong making impossible movements and acrobatics while badly-hidden black-clothed counter figures support them, similar to Hong-Kong martial arts B movies from the 70s? It must have been an inspiring source for this totally exhilarating movie.\n\nA former ping-pong player spent his life as a loser after failing the world championship at the final match and having his army-veteran father killed by the triads. But now, CIA recruited him to go hunt the triad's boss, who is passionate about ping-pong, and he is determinate to get back his and his father's honor.\n\nTo help him, CIA will have him attend lessons on a Chinese kung-fu style school, where he gets to know the true art of ping-pong, as well as a fascinating she-teacher.\n\nThis is a crazy movie and it helped me a lot on a boring 9-hour flight between the US and Italy. Not a masterpiece as Shaolin Soccer, but truly fun. And by the way, the Italian dubbing is even more fun.\n\nI see there are lots of negative critics of this movie, they say it's not worth an 8 euro ticket, but you know what? On a long distance flight I find this much more enjoyable than serious movies.\n\nWhile trying to invent a cure for cancer, a researcher inadvertently releases a virus that mutates humans in a sort of zombies attacking furiously everything they can. Manhattan is the epidemic epicenter and therefore is evacuated and quarantined, but the virus eventually spreads everywhere.\n\nThere is only one survivor: Doctor Levine (Will Smith), who is mysteriously immune to the virus and therefore convinced to have in his blood the seed for a vaccine. For three years he kept on researching a cure, hiding at night in hist apartment in Washington Square and trying to live a \"normal\" life in daylight. He's alone tough, alone and saddened by the lost of his wife and daughter. His dog Samantha is the only companion in his endeavor.\n\nI was in Manhattan when I watched this movie. First thing I was impressed by how realistically they rendered the city in a deserted condition. I could recognize several places and on wondered how they could remove all the crowds who usually walk there, how they could grow grass in the asphalt of the avenues and sand on top of the cars, how they could make it so still. Further, it's hard doing a movie with basically only one actor and almost no conversation. Will Smith here did a very good job. We can clearly see what he thinks, even when he's silent. Third, the plot (from a sci-fi book wrote in 1954) is fascinating. It's not just action and special effects: there's also convincing drama and the \"a-ha\" effect on seed how it would be like.\n\nI read at the last minute they decided for a totally different ending because the original one was bad. Unfortunately, the one they used as a replacement is equally disappointing to me.\n\n1495, Japan is collapsing under US attacks. Their navy has been defeated at the Mariana Islands and now the last line of defense before invasion of the main land line is Iwo Jima, a black volcanic isle in the middle of nowhere. 20000 men are there preparing for the battle. They know they are in huge disadvantage and they're going to die under US sheer power, but no matter what, they will fight to delay invasion as much as they can.

The independent world was supposed to be cordoned off from the violent, profane genre fare that littered the multiplex. Reservoir Dogs was nonetheless a defining moment, because it lent artistic legitimacy to what would have otherwise been dismissed as pulp trash. Adding a twist on the usual heist movie, Tarantino concerns himself with the events leading up to and immediately following a diamond robbery gone violently wrong, but doesn't show the robbery itself, instead focusing on the aftermath as the criminals involved try to figure out what happened while slowly turning on each other."}

And just by knowing that Muros trained Salvador, it added credibility to the story.\n\nWell, I don't know what to say\u2026it's just that I'm amazed how the movie was directed and shot making every angle perfect.\n\nThe plot, however, didn't impress me much knowing that the story is actually typical for us Filipinos. I mean, anybody could have met someone from province who is a breadwinner of their family.\n\nChildren (especially in provinces) have greater responsibility because they are the ones who will sustain their family. Those who have talents or skills could easily make it to the top just like Thelma.\n\nI believe this movie is a must-watch for everyone who is looking for inspiration."}
{"text":"Children of Men: Alfonso Cuaron and the eve of destruction\n\nChildren of Men imagines a world twenty years from now in which most major cities are under siege, there is terrorism on every corner, and women have become infertile. The last child was born 18 years ago, and in this movie's first scene, that young man has just died, and the people mourn. Children of Men is set in Britain but parts of it look like Baghdad; and the general atmosphere is one of paranoia and despair. All illegal immigrants are rounded up by the ubiquitous Homeland Security forces, and shuffled off to hellish, gated prisons that resemble the squalid do-or-die refugee camps you'd find on war-torn African borders. There is hopelessness in the air since, with no new people being born, everyone will eventually die.\n\nClive Owen, a mid-level technocrat living out his days in semi-inebriated boredom, is thrust into the role of reluctant hero in Children of Men when he is asked to help a young immigrant, a fugitive, or \"fugee\" as they are called, escape to safe haven. Why her? Because she is pregnant, and the sight of her belly is looked upon as something from a lost age, a miracle too impossible to believe.\n\nRevolutionaries or, if you will, \"terrorists\" harboring the mother intend to use the baby as a pawn in their struggle to overthrow the military government but Owen, a former anarchist himself, is stirred to action by the possibility of hope, and he vows to ensure the young woman will reach the safety of something called The Human Project, a secret research institute that is trying to reverse the plague of infertility.\n\nI'm leaving much out of this plot description so as not to spoil it, but there is also much the filmmakers have left out\u2014details of how and why and when\u2014that may have satisfied viewers who like their science fiction simplified, but Children of Men would have been crushed under the heaps of exposition required to fill us in. As it is, the film is something of a miracle itself.\n\nThe movie is alive with terror and hope, life and death, survival and savagery. It's a gripping chase film and a thought-provoking human drama, and part of its power comes from the details left unattended to. Is it so hard to imagine this future, a bleak and spiritually scarred planet, where children have stopped being born because maybe, just maybe, they don't want to live in a world gone ugly and mad?\n\nSuch is the devastating, brilliantly realized landscape of this picture, directed with brazen skill by Alfonso Cuaron, who made Y Tu Mama Tambien, The Little Princess, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Cuaron, his cinematographer, and his team of set designers have crafted a damaged and rubble strewn setting which is all too recognizable, a sobering reminder\u2014as if we need one\u2014of how the world could indeed plummet to this kind of hell. Yet, within the bleak inevitability of the end of the world, he also fashions a moving vision of possible salvation: a new Jesus, a human child, whose startling cries manage, for a few minutes, to silence the guns of destruction.\n\nThere are three or four terrifically mounted set pieces in this film\u2014technically accomplished and riveting in intensity\u2014that will leave you drained; and there are also perfectly modulated moments of humor and sadness and basic human decency. At the end of Children of Men you realize you have witnessed a great work of art, and where there is true art in the world\u2014art that communicates the essential humanity we are all capable of\u2014then you realize we can be saved after all."}
{"text":"Tagged: The Grifters\n\nDo con-men and women really look this dashing? If so, I'm not cut-out for the job.\n\nLilly Dillon (Huston) is a veteran con artist who begins to rethink her life when her son Roy (Cusack), a small-time grifter, suffers an almost-fatal injury when hit with a thrust from the blunt end of a baseball bat, right after a failed scam. However, she doesn't realize that her boy has fixed himself up with a dame (Annette Bening) that may not seem to be all that she appears to be.\n\nCalling this movie a \"thriller\" would not be doing it any justice, and I'm still contemplating on whether or not it's the good type of justice, or the bad. Good, mainly because it has you siked and ready for a story about a trio of cons that never tell the truth, always seem like they're up to something, and always know to make a little extra-dough by playing to cool, but at the same time, bad, because it has you siked and ready for a story about a trio of cons that never tell the truth, always seem like they're up to something, and always know to make a little extra-dough by playing to cool. See, it's not the type of film about cons that you'd expect. It's not filled with a big-heist, it's not filled with thrilling suspense and action to hold you over, and it's not even really filled with that many twists or turns. Instead, it's sort of like the day-time soap opera version of a movie about cons and that's both good, and bad. It's very love-hate with me here, and I think you're about to find that out.\n\nThe problem I ran into with this flick was that I feel like it would be going-on in such a slow, tedious-pace that it almost felt deliberate. Most movies that have this slow pace, usually do it for the same reasons that this flick did it, but it works a lot better for them since it's exactly how the story should be told and judges how effective it will be to the viewer. However, with a story\/movie like this, the slower-pace doesn't quite work as well as it might think and continued to piss me off, because every time the film felt like it was really getting somewhere and picking-up itself and all of the pieces it was leaving on the ground, it would just stop, take a moment to pause, and jog it's way through.\n\nIt was like me in a 5k mile run. I start off so perfectly, then I realize I put too much energy into the first 5 minutes, then I decide to slow things down, almost to the point of where I begin to walk, then, I get some inspiration and energy in my step and begin to run again, and then so-on, and so-forth, all up-until I get to the finish-line and everybody treats me like I just cured cancer, even despite me coming in 2nd to last place. Okay, maybe that's not exactly how it goes with me (I obviously always win those runs, obviously\u2026), but that's how I felt with this flick and I feel like director Stephen Frears was just toying with me on-purpose. In some ways that works and makes the flick seem less predictable as it strings along, but in other ways, it just feels cheap and sort of like the director wants to be like the characters and play a sick, cat-and-mouse game that some people may not be too happy with in the end when they find out what's to come of it all.\n\nHowever, I can't hate on Frears too much because no matter how slow and languid the pace got, I was always interested in seeing what was going to happen next. The story definitely takes it's fair-share of detours into the past and they are definitely what feature the most energy and fun of the whole flick, but whenever it focuses on these characters, what they're doing now, how they're getting their money, and who's playing who, the film still stays fun, if not all that energetic as the flashback sequences. Seeing cons do their thing like no other is always a blast to see on-screen and rather than just having it be a flick that exposes trick-after-trick, we get more of a balanced look at how broken and dull some of these cons lives are, and how money cannot buy them happiness and instead, only buys them more trouble. You actually care for these characters and that's only what raises the stakes even more when the unpredictable-factor of this story comes into play, and you feel like you have no idea where it's going to go or how, you just know that somebody is playing somebody. Then again, when you think about life and all that is: aren't we all?\n\n\"Nope, Warren's still bigger.\"\n\nOkay, away from the philosophical ramblings of a 19-year-old film critic, back to the movie at-hand here. Yeah, the Grifters. I think without this trio of leads that the flick features, it probably would have folded underneath it's own weight but thankfully, this trio of leads are here and are here to give some magnificent performances that stick with you, long after the flick is over. Before '90, John Cusack was mainly known for racing randomly in the streets and always knowing the right Peter Gabriel track to have the ladies swooning, but once the year 1990 actually hit and this flick came-around, people began to look at him differently and realize something about him: this guy's all grown-up. Cusack never really got a chance to stretch his acting-skills back in those days, mainly because everybody thought he was made for just hooking-up with high-school girls and in a way, they may have been right, but Cusack proved them all wrong and showed that the guy could play a sly, evil son-of-a-bitch that was as slick as they come and didn't know when to stop pulling-in jobs and ranking-up the dough. Cusack always seems like a believable character and that's all because the guy never over-does his whole cool essence and look to his act and always seems like he's one step ahead of everybody else in the flick, as well as the audience themselves, yet, we always like him and cheer for him as things begin to go South for his hormones and his job. I guess being a con is considered a job and if so, he definitely must have had to won \"Employee of the Month\", at least once.\n\nAnjelica Huston plays his mommy, who just so happens to be 14-years-older than him and shows you that the gal can, as usual, play a strong-willed and big-brained, female-lead like no other and as much as this may seem like a convention of hers by now, I still can't hold that against her. Huston's great with this role and you always wonder whether or not she is Roy's mom, his lover, a past-fling, or simply, just some chick who's trying to play a con on him and get his stash of cash. Like the rest of the characters in this trio, you never know what's up with her and what her next move is going to be, but like typical, Huston-fashion, she always keeps you guessing and interested. Still, I was just waiting for that wig to come off. I could not believe how legitimate it truly was in terms of the story and setting.\n\n80\u2032s teen heart-throb he is no more.\n\nThe best out of this trio, and the one who really stands-out among the rest is probably Annette Bening as Myra, the fellow-squeeze of Roy. Bening, no offense to her or her looks, has never really been the type of actress that I could really declare \"sexy\", \"hot\", or even one that I would just have to take to bed, if I saw her in real-life (because they all would go to be with me, let's face it), but here, she totally had me re-think that. Bening uses her flair for sexuality and nudity to her advantage and has her character come-off as a bit of a tramp, but a smart tramp at best, and a tramp that knows exactly what she's doing, even if the others may not be able to catch onto it right just yet. Out of of the three, you'll be wondering the most what side Bening's is on and when you finally get your answer, you may be shocked, you may not be, but what you will be, is surprised by how much Bening uses the look and feel of sex-appeal to make a character that's full of it, really, really work.\n\nConsensus: Stephen Frears' direction definitely makes you feel as if he is just playing with you, just in-order to be more like his subjects, but that's why The Grifters does, and does not work in it's own right. However, you can't deny the charm and power that is within these three performances and it's just wonderful to see them act each-and-every-single-one of their asses off, even if the pace seems to not be serving them the full-plate that they so rightfully deserves.\n\n7\/10=Rental!!\n\nPossibly the gayest look John Cusack has ever given another man caught-on-film that"}

While telling the story, she's touching herself, and then she starts touching him.

It isn't, but that is how it begins. Bijou Phillips stars as Carys Reitman, an emotionally-stunted pretty girl who is searching for a life connection. Not a guy, but emotion, to be able to feel the same way inside as others do. Of course she meets a guy. You expect the movie to continue as a romantic comedy, with comedic lines from her roommate and friends, and the usual awkwardness when the girl keeps lies from the guy.\n\nInstead, \"Wake\" took a fairly dark turn, and meandered through various genres not usually associated with romantic comedy. I was pleased that it didn't take the predictable route, but I was also put off by how weird and jarring the film had become.\n\nUltimately, the film is a character drama about Carys. In this regard the film was quite good, Carys is a unique and original character, she has her flaws and she is captivating. Carys' journey to understand herself and human nature is beautiful.\n\nBecareful of labelling this as a romantic comedy, and be on the look out for odd turns, but as a character drama this film can be enjoyed. If you're looking for something different that you can't quite put your finger on, then \"Wake\" is your choice.\n\n14 of 17 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?"}
{"text":"Chicken With Plums - Film Review\n\nBefore knowing anything about the writers and directors of Chicken With Plums, a whimsical drama from France, I was sure the filmmakers were probably theatre trained who had been given their big shot at the movies and were determined to include every visual theatrical trick in the book they could think of in order to tell their story. I was close.\n\nWriter\/directors Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud based the film on their graphic novel of the same name, Poulet aux Prunes, and you can see the artistry from a illustrative background in almost every scene.\n\nThe time is 1958 and we're in Tehran back when the city was allowed to be an open society. Western influence in arts and culture is everywhere. The film's central character, Nasser Ali Khan is one of the world's most famous violin players of his day. After his wife smashes his beloved instrument \u2013 something we catch in flashback \u2013 Nasser attempts to find the perfect replacement, but can't. Nothing will ever sound as good to Nasser as his violin, the most important thing in his life. Having lost interest in everything, Nassar confines himself to bed where he awaits his death. It's while lying there, waiting to pass away, he allows his mind to drift over the key moments of his life, including a fanciful meeting with the Angel of Death.\n\nThe look of the film is extremely stylized; street scenes look intentionally artificial. A character's billowing white veil turns into the drifting smoke of a cigarette; a single snowflake falls from the skies, drifts to the earth and lands on the tongue of a little boy standing with his head held back and his mouth wide open. There's an initial feeling of exhilaration to the film's simulated look that is both creative and exciting to watch, but it begins to wear thin about halfway through when you start to feel you're watching a bag of tricks rather than a genuinely creative way of telling a story.\n\nThe film has a lot of charm and enjoyably sly, politically incorrect humor. An irritating child who can't keep still is given a small amount of opium to calm him down. He enjoys the feeling so much that when he's dropped off at another babysitter, the first question he innocently asks is \"Do you have any opium?\"\n\nFor a story that is essentially a drama of a drawn-out suicide, Chicken with Plums is told with the playful energy and the quality of a fairy tale. It's a strange mix that doesn't blend as well as I'm sure the filmmakers hoped, but at least it never bores.\n\nAs for the odd title; it comes from a passing remark in a voice-over where we learn that the only time Nassar's wife saw him happy was at mealtimes when eating his favorite dish; chicken with plums."}
{"text":"Other stories that might interest you...\n\nWhat really sets The Vow apart from other romantic movies is that it is based on true events. Going into the theater knowing that made me take a whole different perspective on the movie. When I watch a movie created by someone such as Nicholas Sparks, I always leave the theater feeling like the movie was romantic, but that no one really acts that way in reality. When watching The Vow it makes you realize that there are really people out in the world that do amazing things for the people that they love.\n\nThe Vow is based on Leo and Paige's marriage; right after the couple said their vows, they get into a horrible car wreck. After the accident, Paige (McAdams) loses a portion of her memory; the portion that involves her husband. She wakes up not remembering her life with him at all. Leo (Tatum) spends much of the movie desperately trying to win back Paige's heart in various ways.\n\nMcAdams does a great job of evoking emotion throughout the film, as does Channing Tatum. I felt a range of emotions. In the beginning, their relationship was cute, the type you read about and admire. Throughout the movie, however, I began to fear things would not work out the way I wanted them to. Even though this film made me emotional, it was the type of movie that is supposed to do that. I would say that McAdams and Tatum did a wonderful job playing to the heartfelt roles of their characters.\n\nIf I were to give this movie a 1-10 rating, I would give it an eight. The layout of the movie and the acting were both really great. I would recommend The Vow to anyone who is interested in romantic movies.\n\nComments\n\nFeel free to leave a comment... and oh, if you want a pic to show with your comment, go get a gravatar!"}

{"text":"The Lucky One\n\nCan a drama be too restrained? \"The Lucky One,\" adapted from a Nicholas Sparks novel, stars Zac Efron in a sudsy romantic melodrama that in the 1950s would have been directed with lurid overkill by the likes of Douglas Sirk.\n\nWould that this tepid, inert enterprise had Sirk's nerve and verve. Instead, director Scott Hicks lavishes good taste and sunsets on a story that - devoid of genuine tension, conflict or combustible chemistry between its two stars - just prettily sits there.\n\nEfron plays Logan Thibault, who as a Marine in Iraq happens upon a photograph of a beautiful blonde and proceeds to see the picture as a talisman that saves his life. When he returns to the United States, he tracks down the girl - who turns out to be a single mother named Beth (Taylor Schilling) - and begins working in the dog kennel she runs with her grandmother, played with vinegary acumen by Blythe Danner.\n\nAll great romances hinge on two things: keeping the principals apart and getting them together. When a conclusion is as foregone as the one in \"The Lucky One,\" the first part of the equation becomes nothing but contrivance and ginned-up conflict. Here, the obstacles consist largely of Logan's attempts to tell Beth why he has come to Louisiana (changed from North Carolina in the book), but choking handsomely on his words.\n\nHuman Dreamsicle Efron has buffed and tattooed himself to the bulked-up extreme for his big dramatic turn in \"The Lucky One,\" but the role of a stoic, expressionless philosopher-soldier requires that he tamp down his natural exuberance and physical grace, a regrettable misuse of his native talents.\n\nSchilling possesses the natural beauty of Reese Witherspoon mixed with the less processed charm of Leslie Mann, but her travails with a bullying ex-husband and sensitive son don't quite qualify as dramatically high stakes.\n\nMost of \"The Lucky One\" consists in proving how sensitive Logan is (he reads Melville and plays the piano with a suitably faraway look) and how put-upon Beth is as she clatters around her grandmother's impeccably distressed cottage and affects Veronica Lake-esque bangs-in-the-eye sultriness. (Surely one index of age is the reflexive desire to tell an actress she'd be so much prettier if she'd get her hair our of her face. But really, Schilling would.)\n\nIn 2004, \"The Notebook\" - from another Sparks novel - became a bona fide sleeper hit, catapulting the relatively unknown Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling to newfound stardom. \"The Lucky One\" tries hard to re-bottle that lightning, to no avail.

{"text":"Beginners\n\nTelling the story of a dying widower who announces he's gay, 'Beginners' comes out strong.\n\nShould you need motivation to make a life change and visit the great god\nGoogle for guiding thoughts on new starts, you'll find pithy aphorisms\naplenty.\n\nThey range from the witty (Mae West's \"You're never too old to become younger\") to the philosophical (Seneca's \"Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end\").\n\nWriter\/director Mike Mills' \"Beginners,\" a sweet if sometimes irritatingly twee film playing exclusively at AMC Quail Springs Mall 24, encompasses that same range. It doesn't always succeed in reaching Senecan heights of universal truths, but a strong performance by Christopher Plummer (\"Priest\") and a moving concept make it worth seeing, despite its flaws.\n\nThe story is a fictional version of what happened to Mills after his mother died and his 70-something father came out. An honorable man, he remained true to his wife of about 40 years at the price of being untrue to himself. Whether that honor was a good thing, the film leaves ambiguous, as would life. Known only in flashbacks, the mother character is charming and sympathetic, but, in her complicity, not particularly likable.\n\nI heard Mills (\"Thumbsucker\") in an NPR interview recount that his father opened a conversation with something like, \"I'm going to throw you a ball, and I hope you will catch it.\" Mills told the interviewer that he panicked, thinking his dad was going to ask to move in with him. The film finds the humor and pathos in the parent announcing his homosexuality to his 30-something son, replacing the standard, coming-out trope of the fearful teen facing parents.\n\nThe son, Oliver (Ewan McGregor, \"The Ghost Writer\"), is a graphic artist who can't commit to a relationship. Given his parents' marital model, best described as traditional '50s \"Ozzie & Harriet\" exterior with a \"Twilight Zone\" of lies interior, it's no wonder. Oliver meets his love interest, Anna (M\u00e9lanie Laurent, \"Inglourious Basterds\"), also not much of a one for commitment, at a costume party.\n\nHe's dressed as Freud, which seems heavy-handed, but plays as a sort of ironic self-assessment. (FYI, however, it was Carl Jung, Freud's follower who became an acrimonious defector, who said something much more relevant to Oliver's story: \"What usually has the strongest psychic effect on the child is the life which the parents have not lived.\") The film begins at the universal ending, the death of Hal (Plummer), who, months after coming out, finds he has terminal cancer. His emergence from the darkness of the closet into the light of authenticity ends with a too-rapid return to darkness. Surrounded by friends and an unfaithful but kind lover, played appealingly by Goran Visnjic (TV's \"ER\"), Hal doesn't exactly rage against the dying of the light, but goes boisterously into it, rather than gentle.\n\nPlummer's performance makes the poignancy of the film real, rather than manufactured. McGregor is fine, but Oliver's story is less interesting, despite being the film's primary concern.\n\n\"Beginners\" is not a great film, but it is a moving one. And with 100-degree temperatures outside, seeing it will be cool in more ways than one."}
{"text":"I couldn't really find a good definition of the phrase (Google keeps redirecting to Social Darwinism), but it's obvious he's using it to justify his superiority, which is perfectly appropriate and fits the scenario. More important, I think, is that this isn't the viewpoint of the movie since Philippe is the bad guy. I think the point is that the acquisition of power is one thing, using it to oppress others is another. Capitalism is not a system than can exist in a vacuum since it will always devolve into an oligarchy as it does here, without a mechanism to protect individual rights--at which point it is no longer capitalism. Survival of the fittest is never in perpetuity in any case, even if you control time at the moment (time being a questionable medium of exchange to begin with). There will always be someone who is more fit, more lucky, or is a faster clock.\n\n faster, stronger, more attractive, smarter, richer, most potent, rock stars get access to the \"best\" ( ) females, ergo those qualities feed into the objective. Put another way, the male with the most resources is most attractive to the most females. Money is a good measure of those resources in real life, but mainly comes to us as we age (not so where time is the currency). Potential is the other measure is harder to judge, but the ages of the partners will be closer which is more beneficial for the chances for the children. Potential definitely outclassed currency on hand in the movie, particularly after he allied himself with the magnates daughter.\n\nWatched the movie on TV couple of days back. The concept itself is decent, but the execution is really not good. Poor Writing, plot with a lot of holes and inane dialogues. But still just about enough to keep you interested enough to watch the movie through till the end. Trueman Show was a much better movie from the same director.\n\nJustin Timberlake is decent.

It's whatever is important in that era to living longer and also mating partners. Both are important because even if you have more access to mating partners, it's not going to help much if you are going to die at 18.\n\nAt different times in our evolution, this has been different. Looks have always been relevant, but at some time, the other important criteria was strength, now it's probably making money.\n\nI agree with Movieboy above me. In fact, my own review of the film, which I ranked at the start of the year:\n\n\"A great premise, and a poor film behind it. I only rank this high due to the fantastic idea for a story. The movie itself is stupid, but the premise... you just want this premise to work.\"\n\nThere were a few decent scenes and some decent acting... occasionally. But the script itself was weak and the actors didn't have much to go off of. What a fantastic idea for a story, and yet an incredibly poor attempt at execution. Tier 5.\n\nI like Amanda Seyfried because she has big eyes and bigger tits, but I really didn't want her character to be part of the plot of the film. I didn't like the fact that the movie explored class warfare the way it did. Sure, I wanted to see it present, but I'm a conservative, and I'd like to think that the system works. I wanted to see the system work where time = money and the consequences of such, instead of the rich and powerful vampiring themselves off of the lower classes, and people live daily in fear that tomorrow will be their last day.\n\nAnd they explored some of the concepts that I wanted to see, such as running everywhere, but the interesting bits of the movie were under-explored so we could, instead, be given yet another liberal propaganda film.\n\nProximity wrote:Of course Trobber Dobson over here made this thread and called this movie good.

For me, it probably tops out somewhere around ten miles, and that was in good weather, wearing good shoes. Still, my feet felt like they were going to fall off, my back ached, and I never wanted to take another step again. (Yes, I'm kind of a wimp.) \"The Way Back\" is a film about a handful of men (and one fourteen year old girl) who escape from the gulags of Siberia and walk\u2026all the way to India. 4000 miles, across some of the most treacherous, rugged, and beautiful country in the world. Four. Thousand. Miles.\n\nIt's an incredible story, a testament to the human will and endurance. Sadly, that's not enough to make it a compelling movie. Because these men, and this girl, they don't do much. They walk, and walk, and walk. Through blizzards, and swarms of mosquitos, across deserts, up mountains and down the other side. \"The Way Back\" is co-produced by National Geographic, and it's filled with some really amazing photography of landscapes. But it's a movie about a long haul, and it's a long haul of a movie. It took an incredible amount of perseverance to complete this journey, and not everyone who embarked survived. It'll take a much smaller act of perseverance to finish this movie, but not everyone who starts it will make it to the end.\n\nStar Rating: The Way Back is said to be about gulag escapees who, during World War II, trekked to freedom on a 4,000 mile journey from Siberia to India. I'm well aware that there are many true stories from that time about the triumph of the human spirit, but this particular story seems utterly impossible to me. Maybe it's because the film is based on an autobiographical book that has, for all intents and purposes, been debunked. Or maybe it's \u2026 more\n\nDirector Peter Weir's \"The Way Back\" is a pretty straight-forward tale of human survival. It doesn't try to be more and it doesn't pretend to be more.

The ending was a bit typical, wrapping up all the pieces, but that's not always a bad thing. I guess I've seen enough films that I prefer the open-ended ones because they feel more realistic, but a film doesn't lose too many points for trying to tie things up neatly, I suppose. I'm making way too much of it here, it's so very slight tying up in this film, and it's got such a great atmosphere that it almost doesn't matter how it ends. The bottom line is that A) life doesn't end at retirement and B) it's never too late for things to get interesting. Lots of hinted at"}
{"text":"DEATH OF SEASONS is an independent feature shot on the DVX100A in Atlanta. It's about a smart and angsty guy (Gabriel, played by Delfo Baroni) who has a nasty little habit of murdering people. To him it is more of a quest or mission then a habit. His best friend, Aaron (Justice Leak), is a deeply religious and morally righteous guy who tries to help Gabriel see the light... but he's dealing with his own moral dilemma mostly involving his atheist girlfriend Meredith (played by Desiree Markella). Gabriel meets his match, so to speak, when he takes on the job of typing a blind bitter old war veteran's memoirs (Mr. Harper, played by Kermit Rolison).\n\nA tremendous amount of passion and energy went into the making of this film. So far we have received the following praise from critics:\n\n\"Death of Seasons excels as a film that never lets the low-budget, independent stigma bring it down. The excellent direction by White and wonderful writing and portrayal of Gabe by Baroni only solidify the film's ascension to the top of the indie scene.\"\n-Entertainmentopia.com - B+\n\n\"The film is visually stunning and the score, by Nicholas Alan and Joshua Montcalm, only adds to the striking direction. The acting, particularly by Leak and Rolison, is top notch. The dialogue is swift and well composed, even when it's dwelling on the theories of Kant or Nietzsche.\"\n-CinemATL - 3 out of 4 stars"}

{"text":"Grand Piano\n\nGenre: Thriller Premise: As a pianist readies to play his concert, he is told that if he misses a single note, he will be killed. About: Chazelle optioned a script last year titled \"The Claim.\" He went out wide with this spec in June but it didn't sell (for those counting, roughly 25% of specs that have OFFICIALLY gone out this year have sold). Still, a longtime Scriptshadow reader highly recommended it to me so I thought I'd give it a shot. It's always interesting to take a look at the professional stuff that *doesn't* sell, so you can try and determine why. Writer: Damian Chazelle Details: 119 I see 'thriller' and I see 120 pages, I don't immediately think, \"Good.\" I think \"Uh-oh, what's going on here?\" Thrillers are supposed to be taut. They're supposed to move fast. So why would you create a thriller with all those extra pages? It makes me skeptical. It makes me suspicious. So I went into this one with my guard up.\n\n27-year-old Tom Selznick is flying into Chicago. He's not doing too well because Tom is a terrified flyer. At least that's what we think at first. It turns out, however, that Tom is more terrified of what happens after the flight, not during.\n\nPutting together the pieces, we learn that Tom is a pianist. But not just any pianist. One of the top pianists in the entire world. And tonight he's going to give a concert that will define him for the rest of his life. You see five years ago Tom was at the top of his game. Nobody could touch him. But Tom had a big weakness. Stage fright. At any moment, he could crumble like an old Chips Ahoy cookie. Eventually he couldn't take the pressure anymore, so he retired and planned on never performing again. But recently, his teacher and mentor died, forcing him out of retirement to give one last concert.\n\nSo Tom sets up with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and prepares to perform. Naturally, he's terrified out of his mind. His girlfriend, Emma, is in the audience, cheering him on. The word around town is not so much, will Tom be great? But will he screw up?\n\nWell Tom's about to realize that stage fright is the last thing he'll need to worry about. As he's getting ready, somebody whispers into his headset, \"Play one wrong note and you die.\" At first, Tom thinks this is a joke. But our mysterious hidden killer offers a few visual cues which make it clear that this is anything but a joke.\n\nWith no time to figure out what the hell is going on, Tom must begin the concert. To make matters worse, our mysterious killer in the shadows is threatening to kill Emma if Tom tries anything funny. So not only must Tom play a piece that's already impossible and not miss a single note, he must save his girlfriend.\n\nAlso of note, is that Tom is playing on his mentor's old piano. And his mentor was like a billionaire or something. I don't think I need to put two and two together for you. Clearly, there's likely something very important inside that piano that our mysterious killer wants.\n\nOkay.\n\nI want to make clear that I have nothing against the writer here. But Grand Piano didn't work for me on pretty much any level. And it all came back to the concept. If your concept is flawed, it doesn't matter what you write afterwards, because the audience already doesn't believe in your story. The concept here is preposterous. I don't know any other way to put it. We are to believe (spoilers) that, first of all, a man would lock his money inside of a grand piano, then set up a complicated locking system in which the only way to get the money would be to play the most impossible to play piano piece in the world.\n\nThat alone is difficult to buy. But then we're also to believe, that in order to steal this money, a man would hide in the shadows of a concert and hold the piano player at gunpoint, telling him if he messes up he will be killed.\n\nSo let me get this straight. In order to coerce someone who's notorious for screwing up under pressure into playing the perfect piece, you tell him that if he screws up, he'll die? I don't know how that makes sense.\n\nI mean, wouldn't the far easier method be to get the piano alone, break it open, and steal the makeshift safe that's inside? Then you could have a month, two months, six months, however long you wanted, to break the thing open. If you have the resources to break in to an auditorium and set up a gun in a hiding place, I'm sure getting the piano alone wouldn't be too difficult.\n\nThe thing is, even if you buy into this, the events that follow become even more absurd. At one point, the red targeting laser from the killer's gun is plastered on Tom's forehead. Nobody seems to notice. At another point, Tom is playing with his right hand while texting on his phone with his left hand. Not only does the audience not seem to notice this, but the person who is obsessively watching his every move doesn't seem to see it either. Finally, during the entire concert, Tom is talking back and forth with the killer into his headset microphone, and nobody in the audience seems to notice. I don't see how these logic problems can just be swept under the rug and treated as if they're not happening. There's no way any of this goes unnoticed.\n\nWhen you write a story, there are going to be leaps of logic, sure, but if those leaps are too big and too numerous, it becomes impossible to believe in the story. It seems like every choice here is a choice that would never happen in the real world. And I couldn't ignore that.\n\nI don't think the characters were well thought through either. For example, if Tom is known for his extreme choking, how is he the most famous pianist in the world? It seems like the writer is trying to have it both ways. He needs the pianist to be great so that the concert can be big, but he also needs him to be a bumbling moron to add tension to his goal. I just don't know how you can be one of the top three pianists in the world and also be blatantly incapable.\n\nThe friend characters were also a problem. They weren't even Tom's friends. They were Emma's friends. So when Tom sends out a text to these non-friends for help, we feel like we're jumping into another story. We don't even know these guys. They don't even know our hero. So we have no feelings towards them one way or another as they sort of try to save Tom.\n\nTopping this all off, I'm going to jump back to my first concern, the length of the screenplay itself. No thriller. None. Should be 120 pages. Of all the genres you can write, the one that you cannot come up with a legitimate excuse for needing 120 pages to tell is the thriller. A thriller is supposed to thrill. It needs to move. If it's a sentence over 105 pages, you're probably doing something wrong. Either you're including scenes you don't need to include, or you're repeating beats that don't need to be repeated. The only reason for a thriller to be a bit on the meaty side is if you're adding character development. And there isn't any character development here in Grand Piano.\n\nI'm probably beating up Grand Piano too much. The thing is, I can see why an agent or manager in theory would go out with this script. It does have something happening. There is a story here. It's intense. This isn't some self-indulgent semi-autobiographical piece about a twentysomething trying to figure out his life. At least there's a story.\n\nBut I just don't think the concept, in its current form, is believable enough for people to suspend their disbelief. Maybe if you create a more traditional story throughout the first two thirds of the screenplay and then make the concert, which we've been leading up to, the climax, there might be something there. But you have to totally rethink this idea that a man has to play a perfect concert in order to unlock a secret piano safe. I just don't see how that works.\n\nWhat I learned: It's very important you put yourself in your villain's shoes and ask the question, \"If I was this person, would this be my plan?\" Ask yourself if the plan makes sense. Ask yourself if there are better options. If there are better options, then why would you use this option? If you don't have a good enough reason for using the least efficient option, then you probably need to rework your story. Because you can bet that the reader and the audience are going to be asking that same question. \"Why wouldn't he just do this instead?\" The closer your plan mirrors reality, the more likely it is that the audience will buy into it."}

It honors the audience's intelligence, which makes it a double rarity.\n\nThe friendship that painstakingly evolves is between Prince Albert, Duke of York (Colin Firth) and Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a frustrated Austalian actor turned highly unorthodox speech therapist. Albert, who has a dreadful stammer, has failed all previous medical interventions and vows never to try another.\n\nOnly the ministrations of his wife, Elizabeth, (a marvelous Helena Bonham Carter) bring him to Lionel, who, believing emotional intimacy is curative, insists on addressing the rankled Prince as \"Bertie,\" the family nickname. \"My game, my turf, my rules,\" he states flatly.\n\nAmong many other good things, \"The King's Speech,\" directed by Tom Hooper (HBO's \"John Adams\") and written by David Seidler, is a meditation on a transitional time when royalty was expected to speak to the nation and not just pose commandingly before it.\n\nAlbert, son of King George V (Michael Gambon), believed he was protected from the humiliations of public oration because his brother Edward (Guy Pearce) was in succession.

{"text":"Not that I'm surprised. The second the Hobbits swept the Oscars, I could see it coming. A bunch of useless, capitalist, soulless executives in every major motion picture studio were already adding up how much money they were going to make optioning anything that had a wizard. Or a dragon. Or a crystal-cloak-wand. You get the idea. I just settled into my seat and waited to be bombarded by bad CG fireballs being thrown at bad CG trolls, while some old, formerly respectable British actor looked on and stroked his beard-extensions. And I would just hate it.\n\nLuckily, there's often someone out there on the ball just enough to spin a sales trend like this in an interesting direction. And in this case, it's Guillermo del Toro and his new film Pan's Labyrinth. Although del Toro has had his biggest success with strange-but-mainstream horror flicks like Mimic, Blade II, and the disappointing Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth has much more in common with a smaller, darker film he released in 2001: The Devil's Backbone. Both films are set during the Spanish Civil War. Both films are in Spanish. And both use the lives of children in violent times to draw depressing insights on humanity.\n\nWhile The Devil's Backbone drew inspiration from horror, however, Pan's Labyrinth has more to do with tropes from fantasy and fairy tale. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother arrive at their new home in the rural hills. Ofelia's new stepfather is Captain Vidal, who has been put in charge of eliminating the last few rebels left in the forest. No man could be better inclined to the job: he's merciless, amoral, and brutal. Strangely, these qualities don't really translate well into being a father\/husband. Stranded in this horrible situation, Ofelia escapes into an elaborate fantasy involving a nearby labyrinth, as well as fairies, monsters, and a faun who sets her on a magical quest. Is it her fantasy, or is it all real? No, I'm actually asking you, because the movie doesn't really clear it up.\n\nBut anyway, what's most interesting about the film is the slow shift in tone it takes as it goes on. The light, na\u00efve tone of Ofelia's fantasy world becomes darker and darker as the brutality of the real world starts to infiltrate it. The audience is drawn into a world that ends up being far more disturbing to watch than they're initially led to believe. The result is a far more compelling world that doesn't want to leave you after the film is over.\n\nOne of the few complaints I had about the film really isn't a complaint I can really fault the film for, since it's such a ubiquitous practice in films today. I don't find CG monsters, or effects, engaging at all. I'm fully aware that in reality the actor is staring at nothing. Of course, don't listen to me, all I do is ramble. Just go watch Pan's Labyrintha and tell me which characters are more fascinating to watch: the toad and the fairies, or the animatronic Faun and Ogre"}
{"text":"Jeremy Heilman's review:\n\nThe Duke shows his sweet side here, which helps to temper the feeling that what we're watching is something other than a bundle of cliches. Surprisingly, his time spent with Quakers is more effective as a romantic comedy than either a Western or a conversion drama. Wayne and Russell certainly have strong chemistry together, but it's a cute, phony kind of it. Neither is ever believable, but in the movies presence is enough and they both have it in spades. The pacifist message here is somewhat obscured amid the frequent gun play, but the cornball ending still works well enough."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't believe this film has much \"thematic purpose.\" But that's not the point; this is a different kind of film: it is a film that wants to capture an image and the emotions and thoughts attached to that image.

It's an experience, one every movie lover should have once. I know I was uncomfortable throughout, but I still haven't decided if that's a good thing or a bad thing.\n\nNot even remotely close to being shocking, breathtaking, revelatory or whatever the fuck else. Jokes are funny enough to make you smile, not laugh. The black metal soundtrack is...interesting, kind of funny, not really a plus. Really, the director is just a pretentious dickhead and this is hipster trash.\n\nIt's an interesting, original and fresh film, which details the moral downfall of a town after a tornado. It has some scenes you won't find anywhere else, and it's pretty much the only movie about killing cats for a profit that I know of. It's pretty much a new take on drama, instead showing a linear storyline it shows seemingly disconnected images which tell the story of a destroyed town and it's residents. Plus, the ending is great in my opinion, It makes great use of the song \"crying\".\n\nHarmony Korine should die in pain and suffer really long before that, same goes for the people financing that stuff.

{"text":"reviews by Anis Tabet\n\nMenu\n\nHow often does a seemingly simple film capture the imagination of the world? \"Intouchables\" does, with originality and charm. It's so vividly real and touching, that it holds you spellbound for two hours, with no letup. The movie was a smash hit in France, with a staggering 5 million cinema-goers flocking to catch the film in its first two weeks. But why? Yes it is essentially a buddy movie, but with a twist. On the surface, it may sound like a horrendous clich\u00e9 with the potential to be dull and repetitive. But truth be told, writer directors Oliver Nakache and Eric Toledano have created a film that is not only heartbreaking, but funny and socially accurate aswell. The story follows the unlikely bond between Philippe (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet), a widowed aristocrat paralysed from the neck down after a paragliding accident, and Driss (Omar Sy), a young black man of Senegalese origin, who is employed by Philippe as his personal carer. Driss shows Philippe how to enjoy life again, in a clever and often hilarious ways. What I loved about \"Intouchables\" is that it successfully steers away from being cheesy. Early on, we learn that Philippe chose to employ Driss as he knew that a man from the estates would never pity him. In a way, it's the lack of pity that makes this movie so damn good. And by the end, I was deeply moved, not out of pity, but because I loved this unusual relationship.\n\nI came to this movie as a blank state, with no expectations, and came out with a huge smile on my face. \"Intouchables\" is a feel good movie that actually makes you feel good. It's also a movie that earns its laughs honestly and touchingly. Do not miss it."}
{"text":"Just another WordPress weblog\n\nMain menu\n\nMonthly Archives: August 2010\n\nRollerball started life as a short story by William Harrison called Roller Ball Murder. \u00c2 This story, published around 1973 became the basis of the first Rollerball movie in 1975. \u00c2 Rollball holds a special place of personal nostalgia because it was one of the first movie for adults that I remember watching (R-rated) and one of the first big scifi movies I remember seeing (there were other excellent movies before Rollerball, but I had yet to see them).\n\nRollerball is a strange story. \u00a0It's set in the future where corporations have become governments and those corporations used sport to foster both loyalty to the corporation and, in the case of rollerball, prove that the individual is not important, only the group. \u00a0Rollerball accomplishes the latter because the game is designed to be extremely violent and players, then, would typically have a very short career. \u00a0However, Jonathan\u00a0E. didn't \u00a0fit the mold.\n\nJonathan E. survived and excelled at rollerball. \u00c2 By surviving, he put the corporations in an awkward position. \u00c2 They couldn't just sack him; he was too popular. \u00c2 So, they told him to retire. \u00c2 However, the game was all he had left in life so he refused. \u00c2 Thus the story become the conflict between the corporations that want him gone because he disrupted the purpose of the game and Jonathan, a relatively simple man, simply did not want to quit.\n\nI've heard mixed reviews of James Caan's portrayal of Jonathan E. \u00c2 I think he played it fairly well since I think Jonathan's character was that of an uncomplicated person struggling in a life where everything around him is full of schemes and machinations. \u00c2 He's a classic reluctant hero.\n\nOverall, I still enjoy this film. \u00a0I like it's setting (which turns out to be filmed in Germany), the music (classical score), and stark contrast of the incredible violence of the rollerball games and the \u00a0\"intellectual\" \u00a0settings almost everywhere else while all of it being a bit insane.\n\nIn contrast, Rollerball 2002 was a disappointment. \u00a0It is totally possible to make a better movie than the original, but it just didn't happen in this case (despite the star-heavy cast). \u00a0Instead of a futuristic (and arguably unrealistic) world of the original movie, this movie is set former Soviet \u00a0Union and the game itself is a centerpiece of business. \u00a0The game itself in hard to figure out \u2013 why are they going through that tunnel? \u00a0The overall plot seems more like a story about human trafficking \u2013 most players are poorly paid, and once they're in they can't get out. A few scenes in the movie appeared to emulate scenes from the original, but they simply didn't have the power of the original. \u00a0I really didn't care about anyone in the film, about the setting, or the game.\n\nIn our house, we've decided to do the unthinkable: drop cable tv. \u00c2 We haven't actually gone through with it yet since it's a little harder to do than you might think. \u00c2 The idea isn't to flat out give up on TV; it's to get as much TV bang for the buck.\n\nCable TV actually has a great deal of TV for the buck, just not that much of what we want. \u00c2 There was a move years ago to pass regulation that would allow the subscriber to pick and choose what channels you want instead of having to have the Golf channel. \u00c2 If we had that system, we'd probably have less than 20 total channels and would be happy. \u00c2 Instead, we have to have to spend a ton and get a bunch of channels we don't want just so we can see 1 or 2 that we really want.\n\nSo, what are our alternatives? \u00c2 First, an antenna \u2013 we can get about 20 channels, maybe 5 we want. \u00c2 The drawback? \u00c2 It's an antenna plus all the signals are digital in incompatible with our family TV (we do have a compatible alternate though). \u00c2 Second, media purchasing sites like Amazon or iTunes. \u00c2 These cost money, but if you buy carefully it's cheaper than buying Cable TV. \u00c2 Third, subscriptions such as Blockbuster and Netflix (we're still trying these out). \u00c2 Fourth, the library. \u00c2 Libraries have a lot of content. \u00c2 Sure, it's older, but if you haven't seen it it's still new to you. \u00c2 Fifth, free services like Hulu.\n\nThe biggest missing piece of this puzzle is children's programming. \u00c2 Nothing here is really operated with children's programming in mind. \u00c2 We still need to look at Netflix, but at least Hulu has some older children's content. \u00c2 I can imagine that a Hulu-like service that focused solely on children's programming could make a mint.\n\nAs I mentioned before, our TV is a bit dated for this approach. \u00c2 However, it's not the only thing that's dated. \u00c2 We don't have a relatively new computer for serving media (we have an old one, but I'll post again on that!), nor do we have a blu-ray player.\n\nWe have a lot to do to make this transition happen. \u00c2 We'll see when we fully go cable TV free!"}
{"text":"Chess's review:\n\nI really loved this movie. It blends fiction within the fiction of the movie and makes it feel real - whilst you recon at the same time this couldn't be 'real'. It's all about metafiction. A lot of people have lost their feeling towards the world and other people, due to the individualisation of society. And then they invent subsitutes. Substitutes for sexual pleasure for example. People make air dolls look like as perfect people and attribute human feelings to them, but they don't expect 'em to come alive at all. That just freaks them out. People have become afraid of real feelings, mostly devastating. This movie shows the pure desire for loving and being loved."}
{"text":"Other thoughts: I'm going out on a limb a little bit here by trying to incorporate Mel Gibson's recent actions into my review of Edge of Darkness, which might just be Gibson's last successful film if he's not able to get over the stigma of his frighteningly raging phone messages left on his girlfriend's answering machine. In the center of this admittedly dumb thriller is a performance so aloof and out of touch with reality that it ought to be singled out as one of the film's major flaws.\n\nGibson plays a Boston detective whose adult daughter is shot dead on his front porch with him standing beside her. At first, everyone presumes that the bullet was meant for the cop and not the daughter, but as clues unravel, it becomes increasingly clear that there's something illegal and dangerous going on by a private company in charge of maintaining the government's nuclear stockpile, and the cover-up leads back to a Massachusetts senator. The company isn't called Halliburton, but it might as well have been.\n\nTwo conflicts are at the center of the film. First is the mystery over who killed the daughter and the conspiracy that's connected. Second, and apparently more importantly, is Gibson's character's attempt to stay sane in order to complete the investigation. Supposedly, the entire time, he's about to be so overcome with rage that there's no telling what he will do, but he knows that he must suppress the darkness in order to bring justice to his daughter's killers.\n\nThis leads back to my initial desire to look at Gibson's real-life troubles. The tension between sanity and insanity that was intended to come across through Gibson's performance doesn't at all. There's a turning point in the film where, let's just say, Gibson's character isn't able to keep it together, and sadly, this blow-up feels right out of left field. Despite a few times where other characters tell him that he's going to crack, and despite a handful of hallucinations of his daughter which could very well be interpreted as memories and not psychosis, there's no indication that this cop is going to turn out the way he does. This flaw falls square on Gibson's shoulders. Perhaps he's so out of touch with reality himself that he's not able to inhabit a real character anymore. During the moments of histrionics when Gibson shouts or threatens, he's fun to watch, but during the moments of quiet introspection and suppressed grief, he almost doesn't register as having any humanity whatsoever. He's a shell of a character on screen, and perhaps one can point to Gibson's real-life psychological disconnects for answers.\n\nYet, even if Jimmy Stewart were alive and giving his career best performance in the lead role, Edge of Darkness would still be watchable garbage. There are so many plot details that are downright ludicrous that it ultimately becomes impossible to truly invest in the mystery on screen. First of all, the police department lets the cop lead the investigation over his daughter's murder, which is of course a defense attorney's dream scenario. Second, people keep getting killed, though the cop is the biggest threat to everyone. He's allowed to live and move around freely because otherwise there would be no movie. Third, the head of the company shares classified information with the cop which only makes things worse for his own cover-up. This same scene ends with that character asking the cop a truly asinine question for no other reason that to have Gibson point a gun in his face and then ask him the same question.\n\nRay Winstone has a lot of fun playing an unbelievable character with his own unbelievable issues, and the film is convoluted enough to force the viewer to exert a bit of mental energy to keep up, but not smart enough to be intellectually satisfying. Edge of Darkness is certainly compelling enough to pass the time, and the cop's ultimate unspooling does pack a punch. Yet, for all its adequacies, this is still a really dumb film with a lead performance by a man who's perhaps lost touch with humanity to such a degree that he simply ought not to act anymore."}
{"text":"It's a feature of our age that if you write a work of fiction, everyone assumes that the people and events in it are disguised biography but if you write your biography, it's equally assumed you're lying your head off. This last may be true, at any rate of poets: Plato said that poets should be excluded from the ideal republic because they are such liars. I am a poet, and I affirm that this is true. About no subject are poets tempted to lie so much as about their own lives; I know one of them who has floated at least five versions of his autobiography, none of them true. I of course being also a novelist am a much more truthful person than that. But since poets lie, how can you believe me?\n\nThe human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds. And though there be many things in nature which are singular and unmatched, yet it devises for them parallels and conjugates and relatives which do not exist. Hence the fiction that all celestial bodies move in perfect circles, spirals and dragons being (except in name) utterly rejected.Although The Terminator is arguably the more visionary of the first two films, [Terminator 2] is the more visually and viscerally satisfying. It's an exhausting experience and, even 18 years after its release (as I write this review), few films have matched it within the science fiction genre for sheer white-knuckle exhilaration.\n\nBlade Runner is a rare science fiction movie so full of material that pages can be written about it without scratching the surface. A review like this can provide little more than an overview. A detailed exploration of the movie, its style, and its mysteries requires dedication that only someone immersed in Blade Runner lore can provide.\n\nI hate the whole ubermensch, superman temptation that pervades science fiction. I believe no protagonist should be so competent, so awe-inspiring, that a committee of 20 really hard-working, intelligent people couldn't do the same thing."}
{"text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUser Reviews\n\nThis 148-minute (far too long) film is so confusing that you're not sure at times if you're watching a film in 'real' time or watching flashbacks on flashbacks.\n\nThe movie is based on two real characters -- actors Luise Ferada (Monica Bellucci) and bombastic Osvaldo Valenti (Luca Zingaretta) -- who were big movie stars in fascist Italy before and during the Second World War. Despite the film's length, their motivations and personalities are never really explored. We know that they're cocaine users and so consumed with themselves that they are basically indifferent to the fascism that ultimately does them in.\n\nThis is a film that should be alive with the frenetic tempo and intrigue of the times, but it's instead oddly static. It is difficult to imagine at times that a war is going on all around the many characters who weave in and out of the frames -- so many in fact that the viewer starts losing track of who is a fascist, who is a resistance fighter (partisan) or who, like the lead characters, is basically a person who doesn't much care one way or the other.\n\nThis film should have been far more interesting, engrossing and exciting, but it settles instead for a confusing love affair and a strange, leisurely pacing that undermines the film throughout. The director, Marco Giordana, must take responsibility for this.\n\n1 of 3 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?"}
{"text":"Sterritt ** The setting is London a century ago; the heroine is a young daughter of Jewish immigrants who gradually overcomes her apathy toward life through enthusiasm for a theatrical career and the jolt of an unhappy love affair. Desplechin wants to film an adventure of the human spirit in the manner of a Hitchcockian drama, but he doesn't have a solid enough grasp of English culture to equal the complexity of his French productions like \"The Sentinel\" and \"The Life of the Dead.\"\n\nSterritt **** P\u00e9p\u00e9 is a gifted French criminal who's moved his operation to the Casbah, where he lords it over friends and foes until a slinky French temptress leads him into a romantic muddle that proves his downfall. Made in 1937, this masterpiece of poetic realism features one of Gabin's most renowned performances, a smart subtext about French colonialism, and enough exotic atmosphere to keep your head in the clouds long after the final scene. In French with English subtitles.\n\nSterritt ** People literally consume each other in this fragmented drama of two modern-day cannibals: a Frenchwoman who seduces her victims and an American man who's transformed by a medical concoction. Denis's pungent images create a nightmarish mood but don't bring full artistic coherence to her odd mix of gothic horror and postmodern reverie. In English, French with English subtitles.\n\nSterritt *** Howard plays a cranky Mississippi writer who spends hours drinking with his buddy, feuding with his former spouse, worrying about his kids, and collecting rejection slips. He also deals with traumatic events like an alarming car accident and a tragic death in the family. The filmmakers clearly see him as a creative maverick, but he's really a likable clich\u00e9. The movie's best asset is Howard's filmmaking, which makes time-worn story ideas seem fresh and engaging through inventive camera moves and editing effects.\n\nStaff *** A Hollywood producer steals the English essay of eighth-grader and inveterate liar Jason Shepherd (Muniz) and turns it into a movie. Naturally, his parents and teacher don't believe him. To regain their trust, he and his girlfriend head to Tinseltown to extort a confession. The resulting romp through the Universal Studios lot will amuse older children and their parents. By M.K.

The film paints a strikingly hostile portrait of its Latin American characters and some of its mayhem is vicious, even by debased standards of today's action-movie genre.\n\nStaff * Britney and her pals take off on a cross-country road trip, in a convertible driven by a guy with an ambiguous past. Britney's on a quest to see her estranged mom; the others want to compete in a music contest. Between blasting pop tunes, serious issues emerge: date rape, teen pregnancy, and parental abandonment.

{"text":"How on Earth was an entire San Antonio family tricked into believing that a French conman named Frederick Bourdin was their missing 8-year-old boy? This question lies at the heart of The Imposter, a new documentary from British born Bart Layton.\n\nThe film opens up in 1997 when the Barclay family is informed that their beloved Nicholas, who stormed out of their home 3 years prior and never returned, had finally been found on the streets of Spain.\n\nWhen they fly halfway across the world to return him to their Texas town, however, they discover that Nicholas is very different to the person they once knew. He's much older, his eyes are a different colour, he can no longer speak with an American accent and he has no recollection of his previous life. Yet, somehow, the family still fall prey to this con artist's lies.\n\nThrough stock footage, interviews and brilliantly executed recreations, Layton's documentary takes us on a journey through the months proceeding and succeeding these absurd events, allowing us to witness how Bourdin pulled off his near-impossible con. It also explores with remarkable compassion why Bourdin was compelled to do such a thing as a result of his hard upbringing and ensuing desire to be loved.\n\nHowever, as Layton delves deeper into the stories from both sides \u2013 the family and the conman \u2013 dark and surprising secrets begin to surface, forcing you to reevaluate who you believe are really the victim and the perpetrator in this bizarre situation. The film never offers any definite answers though, brilliantly leaving it to the audience to decide what is truth or fabrication from your understanding of the characters.\n\nThe Imposter is a fascinating story, compellingly told with twists, turns and jaw-dropping revelations that will keep you nailed to the edge of your seat as much as any Hollywood thriller"}
{"text":"Many things can happen in ten minutes. The sun could set, a mare could give birth, or the weather could abruptly change. In the case of Nathan Caswell and Jeremiah Zagar's film \"The Unbelievable Truth,\" forty-years of a man's life are presented and it might leave you sick to your stomach. Winner of the Best Narrative Award at the 12th Annual Philadelphia Film Festival, Caswell and Zagar's film begins with a disclaimer warning the viewer of impending graphic depictions of violence. This special note is soon forgotten as the viewer becomes fascinated with Samuel Pinkus's life. \"The Unbelievable Truth\" latches onto segments of Samuel's life and explores his photography obsession. The camera becomes an extension of him, going everywhere with him, even to the morgue where he identifies the body of his dead father.\n\nOn the surface, the film is just about a man and his hobby, but \"The Unbelievable Truth\" aims much farther and further than mere story. Caswell and Zagar examine in their film the power and nature of images\u2014both moving and still. The film itself proves that ordering moving images in a certain fashion can provide a lot of information in a very short period of time. By incorporating still photos in the film, Caswell and Zagar draw attention to the beauty of a picture's immortality.\n\nWhen nineteen year-old Samuel (Michael S. Reich) looks at his dead father, you anticipate the flashing of the camera. Samuel doesn't disappoint. He takes two pictures of his father's bloodied face, and then sends you through an unexpected plunge into other people's pain.\n\nSuddenly, the disclaimer from the beginning of the films snaps in your mind. Images of dead bodies, dying bodies, hurting bodies, and damaged bodies are stringed together, culminating into an unforgettable stamp of suffering.\n\nJust as this portrait of agony is comprised of different pieces, so is Samuel's life. Caswell and Zagar don't look at varying periods of Samuel's life and cast the same actor to play the part. Instead, the co-directors get several actors to portray Samuel at ages two (Yaelle Swarz), seven and ten (Michael Romano), fourteen (Adam Dexter), seventeen and nineteen (Reich), and forty (Eric Russell). Caswell and Zagar go one step more and cast another actor to provide Samuel's narrator voice (Richard Hoffman). Samuel's life is presented in fragments, but the photos he takes serves as a sort of adhesive.\n\nCaswell and Zagar, both born in the beginning of the Reagan Administration, can do a lot in ten minutes. They can efficiently develop a man's life, offer significant moments in that life, and acquaint your eyes with visions you may have never seen before. Caswell and Zagar may not reveal what kind of truth is unbelievable, but whatever the answer might be is beside the point"}
{"text":"FILMINK rates movies out of $20 - the score indicates the amount we believe a ticket to the movie to be worth\n\nWhile there are gaps left uncanvassed, this remains an absorbing exploration of a crucial issue which not only exposes problems, but offers answers.\n\nDavis Guggenheim drives past three public schools on the way to the private school where he drops off his kids. The director and narrator of this sobering documentary knows that he's lucky - he can choose where his children will be schooled. But the parents that he meets in Waiting For Superman can't - and their kids will break your heart.\n\nMost of the children here are from minority groups, living in disadvantaged urban communities. Anthony, a fifth-grader, lost his father to drugs. He's trapped in an underperforming school. So is Daisy. Like Anthony, she's extremely bright. She's a kind-hearted kid who wants to be a vet, a nurse, or a doctor. She may never even get the chance.\n\nGuggenheim - who helmed An Inconvenient Truth and It Might Get Loud - exposes the inadequacies and unfairness within the American public school system, and the reasons why too many kids lack proficiency in the basics. He also offers answers, and hope, with educators like the inspiring Geoffrey Canada. The system is suffering for a batch of reasons, but bad teachers emerge as the main villains. The US system is stitched up so that teachers have jobs for life, irrespective of their performance. Yet the reason why colleges push out so many disinterested teachers isn't really covered, nor is teacher burn-out.\n\nThere are gaps - bigger questions, like why there's so much disadvantage in a rich country - that are not canvassed (if only Michael Moore were here). But this is still an absorbing documentary that lands at a tearfully emotional finale.\n\nBracketed by tales of Superman, with an archival George Reeves, and featuring wise words from that famous Harvard drop-out, Bill Gates, some will feel that Australia is indeed the lucky country after viewing this. But others will see worrying similarities between our system and the broken American one."}

{"text":"With six different plot threads twined together, Cloud Atlas is as lofty-minded as the title suggests. Based on another so-called unfilmable novel - this one by British author David Mitchell even used a different literary style for each subplot - the book and movie both tackle big spiritual ideas. But the film's grand conceit in the clouds is not quite supported by the Atlas weight of its interwoven stories.\n\nMonumental enough to require three directors, Tom Tykwer and the Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana (formerly Larry), the epic is as difficult to explain as Inception, spanning past, present and future linking characters and themes that seemingly have no connections. They include a noble abolitionist on an ocean crossing journey in the 19th century, a 1920s homosexual composer who commits suicide, a 70s journalist working on a nuclear reactor story, a modern day book publisher who gets into debt, a futuristic Seoul with cloned slaves and an even farther along future on a Pacific island (though it looks more like a primitive past) with spaceships and shamans.\n\nThe other well publicised gambit of the production required its stars (Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent and others) to play numerous characters crossing race, gender and age. Why? Because it's part of its earnest theme about karma and how we are all interdependent through time, space and causality. \"Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others past and present,\" says one character and the phrase is repeated into a mantra. Think of Cloud Atlas as Crash with metaphysics and time travel.\n\nAs stories crisscross, conjuncted by details like shared birthmarks and journals and writings of one character that another in a different period reads, the cumulative episodic effect is less cinematic transcendence than overwhelmed distraction. In short, it's hard to focus on the forest if you're constantly thinking about one tree's relation to another.\n\nThe multi-role device is also quite distracting. As an audience, you end up thinking \"Look, it's Tom Hanks as a cockney gangster! And isn't that Hugh Grant as a marauder with face paint? Wow, is that really mainland star Zhou Xun as a white woman with dirty blonde hair?\" Just as jarring are the future Hawaii segments with Hanks and Berry jiving it up in a Jar Jar Binks' patois. Some of the humour is intentional, such as Hugo Weaving in drag as a nasty nurse in an old-age home. There's also a priceless and demented Soylent Green reference.\n\nIt's not that Cloud Atlas is a terrible movie. Far from it. It's a noble failure that aims high but falls very short.\n\nAt 172 minutes, it could use a judicious edit of entire scenes and story lines to refine its trans-generational Kumbaya chorus of fate, truth, freedom and love.\n\nBy the way, the whole controversy of white actors given Asian facial prosthetics becomes an ironic joke since Zhou and South Korean actress Bae Doo-na have such huge eyes. They make Hugo Weaving and other non-Asian cast members' squinty slants that much more embarrassing."}

Here's a domestic drama, simple but realistic (except for the unconvincing ending) and well-played by Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders. It's a rocky marriage and the ebb and flow of their interactions rings true. It's somewhat Bergman-esque (Ingmar, that is). Thrown into the mix is an Italian travelogue, which is kind of nice but it's peppered with really, really obvious symbolism.

{"text":"The Painted Veil is a love story in reverse. The\nfilm is based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham and\nit's about a young English couple, played by Edward Norton and Naomi Watts, who\nmove to China\nin the 1920's. The reason I said it's a love story in reverse is the couple are\nnot in love when they get married. Well one of them was, but the other got\nmarried for the wrong reason. It's only when they move to a remote region and\ndiscover who they really are that the love begins to grow in both of them.\n\nIf you are a fan of\nEdward Norton, he's once again great in this role. But for me to single out Mr.\nNorton on his own would be a disservice to the rest of the cast. Performances\nwere great across the board, especially Naomi Watts. Also the film looks great\nup on the big screen and it really reminded me of a classic Hollywood\nlove story.\n\nBefore getting to the interview I\nwould recommend watching the trailer\nas it does a great job at showing you the lush locals in China that they\ngot to film in. Also the trailer doesn't give the story away, it just provides\nenough to know if you'll be interested in this kind of movie.\n\nSo about a week ago Naomi Watts\nand John Curran, her Director for The\nPainted Veil, did a press conference to talk about their new movie. When it\nstarted John was the only one there and as the interview went on Naomi showed\nup and started to answer some questions. To make it as easy as possible I put\nhis responses in blue. Also if you missed the Edward\nNorton interview you can read it here.\n\nThe PaintedVeil will be\nexpanding in the coming weeks so look for it soon where you live.\n\nQuestions:\nDid you have to get permission from the Chinese Film Bureau before you started\nshooting there?\n\nCurran: Yeah. In\npreproduction the deal came about that it was going to be a co-production\nbetween Yari Film, Warner Independent and Warner China which is made up of\nWarner China in a joint venture with China Film. That's a long way of\nsaying that China Film was involved in the production of the film and therefore\nwe had to adhere to certain kinds of restrictions I guess and satisfy their\nconcerns with the script, and so, look, also it's a PG-13 film and so there\nwere boundaries for the film that we had to adhere to for here. It all just\npresented another set of concerns that we had to deal with. It's hard enough to\ndevelop the script so that it's good and this was just more stuff that came\nabout that we had to deal with.\n\nQuestions:\nWhat kinds of boundaries?\n\nCurran: You mean in\nterms of them? I would say that they ranged from being like sort of travel log\nconcerns from presenting the country in a positive way to historical concerns,\npolitical concerns, not wanting to talk about certain things, not wanting to\nshow crowds doing certain things because it might promote unhealthy crowd\nbehavior \u2013 stuff that we felt at times was commenting more on concerns that\nwere a contemporary context, their concerns anyway, and it had nothing to do historically\nwith what was going on in the story and whether that was correct or not. It was\nsimply concerns they had about how people would react to it today.\n\nQuestions:\nHow do you get Naomi Watts and Ed Norton to come into the picture?\n\nCurran: Well, the\nscript came to me already cast. I was really lucky and fortunate on this one.\nI've known Naomi for a while, for a long time really and I used to live in Australia where\nI met her. We did the film 'We Don't Live Here Anymore' a couple of years ago\nand even at that point I knew she was considering this project. So I knew that\nshe had this kind of connection with this character of Kitty. It was only after\n'We Don't Live Here Anymore' ended up at Warner Independent where\ncoincidentally this project had found a home that the studio contacted me to\nread it with Naomi's blessing and then I met with Edward and we really hit it\noff. So for me the hard part was already done.\n\nQuestions:\nThis movie had a lot of strong relationships. Was that a change for you from your\nlast film?\n\nCurran: Oh, yeah. I\nthink that cinematically there were probably similar things with like the\nmarital discord and a tragic romance. I mean, I guess my last couple of films,\nclearly I haven't figured out love or relationships, but this one I was\nattracted to as much as anything because of the dynamic of the two people. I\nthought that there were a lot of sparks and fire and fun between Kitty and\nWalter. Because it came to me already cast it was a movie that I wanted to see.\nI wanted to Edward Norton and Naomi Watts in these roles. So that was one\nparticular reason that I did the film, those two people playing these two\ncharacters. More so than anything else really.\n\nQuestions:\nWhat exactly does The Painted Veil refer to?\n\nCurran: There is a quote,\nI think, from a line of a poem in one of the editions. I did of research and\nit's a Shelley poem and it's a poem called 'The Painted Veil.' What it refers\nto is a guy who is brave enough to lift the veil that we call life and look\nbeyond that. He is inevitably broken hearted by what he finds, but he's a brave\nperson nonetheless for looking beyond the illusions. I think that there are\nsimilar themes in the book. So that's the title.\n\nQuestions:\nWell, in France\nthe titles translates into 'The Veil of Illusions.'\n\nCurran: How do you say\nit though in French?\n\nQuestions:\n[pronounces it in French]\n\nCurran: See, that\nsounds good.\n\nWatts: That sounds great [Laughs].\n\nCurran: Might try that\nin America.\n\nQuestions:\nThere was talk about the production concerns of the movie, and then there are\nalso some moral and religious aspects to the movie. Can you talk about those?\n\nCurran: Well, the moral\nand religious things, that's where movies like that start to become preachy or\nponderous. What we loved about Diana Rigg was that she sort of subverted that\nidea. We tried to bring a bit of her character into that role and she's a\npretty feisty and irreverent older woman. The political context, I think, was\nsimply just being there and absorbing through our contemporaries that we met\nthere a stronger feeling of what was going on in China in the '20's which was\nironically a really pivotal and important time in the Chinese Republican\nhistory. Surprisingly, or maybe not, Somerset Maugham never touched on that at\nall which shows his either lack of concern or his own arrogance, but we're\nmaking a film that has to work on a lot more layers than the book.\n\nWatts: The book was so interior and I think that with film you have to\nlayer in that external and extra thing. That's the backdrop in it and so the\npolitical stuff in it makes it a lot more cinematic.\n\nQuestions:\nYou changed your hair color for this movie. Was that your decision?\n\nWatts: Yeah, it was. We fought\nover it too.\n\nCurran: We fought a lot\nover it.\n\nWatts: But actually in the end, well basically we arrived there and I\nalways saw Kitty as a brunette. I thought that she was somehow more exotic with\nit and stronger and it felt very authentic to the period. John always saw Kitty\nas a blonde and so we had two wigs made and we did camera tests.\n\nCurran: No, we had the\none you wanted made and then we had a really bad wig made that was never going\nto be the wig. I was totally conned and manipulated into it [Laughs].\n\nWatts: [Laughs] But in the end, come on, you did go for it. I always said,\n'It's up to you.' I'm always scared. I always start with a strong idea.\n\nCurran: Then you lost\nfaith in it.\n\nWatts: I always have strong ideas\nand you fight for it and then suddenly everyone is going to go along with what\nyou've chosen and then you think, 'I hope that this is the right one.'\n\nCurran: In my head I\nhad imagined this blonde standing out in the sea of dark haired Chinese. Maybe\nthat I had that idea in my head, but we talked about it and my feeling about\nhairstyles and clothes and wigs is that if the actor has an instinct, to fight\nthat is sort of foolish. You kind of have to go along with it, and even though\naesthetically I had an opinion I do trust Naomi a lot. The thing is that she\nwas in New Zealand and she had it on and was saying that it looked fantastic\nand that she felt really good in it, but I was in China and so I hadn't seen\nit. So, suddenly, I got this thing in the mail, this mousy ball of hair and I'm\nholding it up to like pictures of Naomi and I was like, 'I can't judge if this\nany good or not.' So it was a bit of blind faith for me.\n\nQuestions:\nWhat was it like being over with the class distinction, or maybe it's not like\nthat over there, but you were portraying that? Was that awkward at all, having\nyour shoes polished for example or the rickshaw ride?\n\nWatts: Yes, exactly. The audacity to be carried for two weeks across the\ncountry by a team of people, and all she could think about was the fact that it\nwasn't comfortable [Laughs]. It's ridiculous and that really comes across in\nthe film. But there were some great moments for utter frustration and then also\nit's even quite comical at one point when they're sort of having that argument\nwhen she's inside fanning herself and he's having this conversation through the\ncurtains. So it was a good element.\n\nQuestions:\nDid you feel emotionally beat up after this?\n\nWatts: No, actually, I felt the opposite.\n\nCurran: She arrived\nemotionally beat up [Laughs].\n\nWatts: And then I left emotionally inspired.\n\nCurran: I think that all\nof us, each in our own way, were all pretty rung out and she had just come off\nof 'King Kong.'\n\nWatts: Which was so physically draining which was eight months of fourteen\nhours a day jumping and running and being punched and pushed and pulled. It\nreally did take its toll and I'm not a big person. So this was a luxury. So,\nyeah, the emotional aspect of it was exhausting, but we had time. We actually\nhad quite a luxury of time and we moved from place to place.\n\nCurran: Fortunately, we\ndid a lot of the heavier stuff because of the weather which required that we\nshoot inside first and that meant that we did the meatier scenes in the very\nfirst week. So, like literally the very first shot of the film that I did was\nher arriving at the bungalow which is really when her character was at her\nworst. It was hot and miserable at the studio. All of us were a bit freaked out\nat being there, and fortunately I think that the process fed into, I think, the\nfilm, but by the end of it was a really different experience for everyone I\nthink.\n\nQuestions:\nWhat do you prefer to do, Naomi, the 'King Kong' type movies or films like\nthis?\n\nCurran: Oh, this one\ndefinitely [Laughs]. That director was a hack.\n\nWatts: They're so different and I probably never would've done 'King Kong'\nwithout someone like Peter Jackson. It's just not like the stuff that I\nnormally gravitate towards, but it was a great experience and really just\ndifferent from what I've done. I do like the intimacy of an independent film\nand the collaborative workspace. I mean, everyday we started with probably a\ntwo hour discussion about how we felt that this scene should go. Sometimes\nthere would be disagreements and there were often three varying ideas to honor.\nSo there was something great about that that we did see when we looked at it in\ndifferent ways and sometimes the ideas we shared, and then other times not so\nmuch. We just kind of played them all out. On a bigger movie it's a much more\ncontrolled environment and there are so many other things going on particularly\non a film like 'King Kong' where there are FX to consider and stunts and all\nkinds of other things.

{"text":"To find a new movie with\na tight, toned plot, you'd have to settle\nfor an old one that happens to feel as good\nas new. Right now, you won't do better than\n''Elevator to the Gallows,\" the\ntasty 1957 noir thriller that introduced the\nworld to French filmmaker Louis Malle, who\nat the time was a 24-year-old assistant director\nfor Jacques Cousteau.\n\nThe movie is cooler and more heartless than\nthe films that would define him. But even\nas a preliminary exercise in suspense, the\nfilm suggests Malle could have made a name\nfor himself as a Hitchcock copycat, though\nhe'd go on to make more feeling pictures, such\nas 1971's ''Murmur of the Heart.\"\n\n''Elevator to the Gallows\" gets\noff to a swift start. In a phone call, illicit\nlovers Florence (Jeanne Moreau) and Julien\n(Maurice Ronet) imagine their future once Julien\ndoes away with his boss, who's also her husband.\nJulien hangs up, tells his secretary not to\ninterrupt him, closes his door, and pulls open\na drawer. Inside are a pair of leather gloves,\na pistol, and a length of rope attached to\na grapple. He then slips out the window and\nonto a veranda\n. Julien hoists himself into the boss's office,\nwhere he puts his gun to the man's head.\nWhen he fires, we see his secretary downstairs\nand hear what she hears: the grind of pencils\nin the sharpener. Upstairs Julien slips the\ngun into the corpse's hand, then climbs back\ndown to his office just in time to call it\na day.\n\nThe sequence is a pleasure to watch both\nfor the smoothness of the criminal and\nthe craftsmanship of the crime. Malle allows\nus to see past the absurdity (Julien is wearing\na suit and dress shoes!) in order to admire\nthe man's aplomb. That I can recount the murder\naction for action suggests a bygone vintage\nof filmmaking. There is neither slam nor bang,\njust an absorbing deliberateness.\n\nJulien, sadly, isn't as meticulous as Malle\nin that sequence. It's not until he's in\nhis convertible, ready to meet Florence, that\nhe looks up and realizes he's left the rope\ndangling in plain sight. Slipping back inside\nto retrieve it, he's trapped in the elevator\nwhen the building is closed for the night.\nIt would be a delight to give you a synopsis\nof what follows, but it would rob you of the\nquality of Malle's storytelling.\n\nMalle was working with the master French\nNew Wave cinematographer Henri Decae, who\nunderstood that the sinister and the sexy did\nnot have to be mutually exclusive. Decae's\nblack-and-white photography infuses Malle's\nmovie with the street-level ominousness he\nused for the formidable noir specialist Jean-Pierre\nMelville, whose ''Bob le Flambeur\"\nhad come out two years before.\n\nThe film's look makes a divine accessory\nfor its music, which Miles Davis composed.\nThere's not even 20 minutes of it in the film,\nyet it still defines the atmosphere, transforming\na crime yarn into a bebop noir. During a particularly\ntense scene in the elevator, all Davis needs\nto do to make us grip our armrests is tap a\ncymbal and pluck a bass. But between Davis\nand Decae, the movie is probably too cool for\nits own good. This picture works better as\na gripping mood piece than it does as a study\nof character.\n\nNothing anyone does is quite believable.\nStuck in that elevator, Julien calmly smokes\naway the hours. As for Florence, she wanders\naround Paris looking for Julien, thinking she's\nbeen jilted. She looks blue yet more fabulous\nas day breaks. When a car screeches to a stop\nto avoid hitting her, Moreau doesn't even bother\nto look up. So, needless to say, panic is conspicuous\nby its absence.\nBut the noticeable lack of human warmth doesn't\ncompromise the plot's strength. Had Malle opted\nfor mannequins over movie stars, the casting\nwouldn't have made the proceedings any less\nentertaining."}

{"text":"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\n\nExtremely Long, Incredibly Annoying: 9\/11 serves as a cheap gimmick in this film take on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel.\n\n\"As with anything,\" Thomas tells his nine year-old son Oskar, \"if you want to believe, you can find reasons to.\"\n\nSo true, and prophetic. For surely if you want to believe in Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, a melodramatic tale about a boy searching New York City for the lock that fits a newfound key, you will find reasons. But when looking at it objectively, director Stephen Daldry's (The Hours) film is long, manipulative and obvious, a saccharine story that plays off 9\/11 emotion and far too often borders on the preposterous.\n\nThomas and Oskar have an interesting relationship that appears to be built entirely on lies. After telling his son New York City has a \"sixth borough\" and that Central Park was literally dragged into the city by locals years ago, Thomas (Tom Hanks) dies in the 9\/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. This leaves Oskar (Thomas Horn, making his screen debut) and his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) understandably distraught.\n\nA year goes by. Still grieving. Oskar searches his father's closet and finds a key, but doesn't know what it's for. Only the word \"Black\" is written on its envelope. Believing it's another quest his father wants him to go on, Oskar attempts to track down every single home in New York City where someone named \"Black\" lives. That's 216, by Oskar's count. He's determined and ambitious, but not to the point where he overcomes his fear of public transit. He admits he may have Aspergers, and it's hard to think he doesn't.\n\nThat Oskar is unlikeable is a combination of the way he's written and Horn's performance. He's written by Eric Roth (working from the book by Jonathan Safran Foer) as an annoying, inconsiderate brat, but we're forced to sympathize with him because his daddy died on 9\/11 and hey, we're jerks if we don't. But this doesn't change the fact that he's odious and obnoxious, the type of precocious little snot that only his mother could love. Horn, who deserves a break only because it's his first performance, never makes Oskar likeable and never had a chance.\n\nIt's dicey at best to tell an emotional story tied so close to 9\/11, and it's not that Daldry isn't sensitive about it. It's just hard to see why 9\/11 plays in at all. This story easily could've been about a boy who loses his father in any tragic incident and goes about his quest. In other words, there's no good reason to use 9\/11 here, and doing so is a cheap gimmick that plays off the still-painful emotions many Americans continue to feel about the most horrible event of their generation."}

{"text":"Review: Looper\n\nRobust characters facing tricky decisions of not only survival, but greater than life-and-death moral choices, provide an edgy crust to Rian Johnson's highly entertaining action time travel flick, Looper. Johnson (the delightful Brick, the beguiling The Brothers Bloom) instantly enters the Christopher Nolan-realm of directors with just his third film. Totally in control, he bobs and weaves Looper between sheer visceral thrills and more thoughtful notions as he finally even whips up a loftier than might be expected ending devoid of clumsiness.\n\nIt's 2044, see, and time travel has no sooner been invented than it quickly becomes outlawed. Of course, the no-good criminals of the future get a hold of it and dispense with sending their unlucky victims to the past (roughly our present) for a quick hit job, performed by \"Loopers.\" One such Looper is Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who lives high on the hog but is constantly on the edge. Seems our future mobsters don't like any loose ends so after their Looper hitmen reach a certain age they themselves become the hunted in an effort to \"close the loop.\" It's when a Looper is ordered to take out his own future self that things get complicated. Only problem: if that future self is Bruce Willis, closing the loop isn't going to be easy. Having a whole lot at stake, he's not exactly cooperative.\n\nWillis isn't the only wily veteran actor capable of cutting through whatever nonsense is in front of him. Dropped into the present from the future, Jeff Daniels is outstanding as the enforcer who oversees any irregularities in the ordered assassinations. Tough as nails would be too meek a description of this guy. He doesn't even need the gray and depressing industrial warehouse prop he calls home to establish his nastiness. It's only when Willis comes on the screen a little later that we realize the bearded and too-calm -to-be-nice Daniels just may just be only the second meanest dude in this movie.\n\nThe two Joes finally meet in a diner. No matter they look about as alike as Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. What follows is a hilarious scene that summarily intends to put to rest any technical difficulties the viewer is having with the film's arrogant if brilliant conception and ensuing plot plausibility. Given Willis' force of character, it largely works. Dispensing our concern for a nuts and bolts dissection of the film's believability is an essential ingredient for getting the most out of Johnson's gritty fun. Excuse me while I just enjoy the film, thank you. Why analyze time travel when it can be strikingly used a set-up for bigger and better sensations? And what a jaunty ride Levitt and Willis provide. They don't exactly see eye to eye on a plan of action. My, my how Joe has changed in 30 years! How will these two manifestations of the same guy, as different as oil and water, reconcile things?\n\nLeave it to a very believable single-mom farmer gal with a gun and a young son. Her introduction fails to diffuse the film's pluck the way a a tacked-on romantic interest could, but actually steps it up a notch. The dramatic dilemma presented by this wood chopping gal played by an excellent Emily Blunt (is it me or has she done at least half-dozen films this year?) rings true as a bell. Seems she may be harboring a future take-over-the-world despot in that very son, who will scare the hell out of you. This refreshingly enriches things, allowing Looper to transcend its very good action movie roots, evolving into a more rarefied plane reserved for films that successfully embrace a certain humanity. Both ticklingly taut and mercifully moving, Looper bridges the gap between the summer's popcorn movies and the autumn's more elevated fare. Johnson performs the rare feat of combining the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Melodrama, a mad profusion of professional lingo, and whips in the bedroom notwithstanding, A Dangerous Method is a spare, if not austere movie, Bressonian in its ellipticality and compression of time. The passage of months, even years, are often marked by an abruptly closed or opened door. Howard Shore's score, poised between late Beethoven and early Wagner is discreetly expressive. What makes the form of the film as radical as its underlying subject\u2014Freud's concept of the unconscious\u2014is the monkey wrench Cronenberg throws into the construction of two shots, three shots, and reverse-angle POVs (or shot\/countershot sequences as they are customarily termed). In recent movies, Cronenberg has favored a somewhat wide-angle lens that flattens space, making the actor in the foreground seem disproportionately large in comparison to the actor in the background. Most directors who use wide-angle lenses try to cover this distortion through movement. Here, however, particularly in the \"talking cure\" scenes, Cronenberg employs the disproportion to reveal something about subjectivity: how one's self-involvement can dwarf one's perception and comprehension of the other, or vice versa. A Dangerous Method thereby becomes a tragic study of the absence of true reciprocity in human relations.\n\nHardly a stranger to human desperation and fragility, the title Dark Horse could be used to describe the universe of Todd Solondz. His highly afflicted, flawed characters possess underdog tendencies; a world not unlike our own. Horse is unflinching, biting, and arguably Solondz' toughest\u2026"}
{"text":"When we think of post-apocalyptic movies it usually involves abandoned metropolises, urban chaos, marauding tattooed tribes or shuffling gangs of the undead. Most are fanciful, action-packed tales of survival against insurmountable foes that bear little resemblance to reality. But what would happen if there were a global catastrophe and you lived in rural Ireland, for example? How would you survive? 100 Mornings posits this scenario as its starting point. Two couples are living in a cottage a short distance from the nearest village. They have food and alcohol but cigarettes are running low. There's no power or fuel, and nothing on the car radio. Their new-age survivalist neighbour has a gun, as do some of the villagers and the local Garda. As the days pass interminably slowly, relationships become strained and desperation starts to set in as the supplies dwindle. The film generates a sense of terse drama, as ordinary people try to survive in extraordinary circumstances. It is the references to the familiar which make this movie completely engrossing \u2013 a brilliant departure from the tried-and-tested post-apocalyptic norm!

{"text":"The Bird People in China\n\nSynopsis\n\nWada (Masahiro Motoki), a salary man, is enlisted to venture off to China to investigate a potential Jade mine. After his arrival, Wada encounters a violent, yet sentimental, yakuza (Renji Ishibashi), who takes the liberty of joining his adventure through China. Led on their long and disastrous journey to the mine by Shen, the three men come across something even more magical and enticing...Takashi Miike at his calmest. That doesn't necessarily make the movie good, exactly, but it definitely showcases the director's versatility. I have always believed Miike to be one of the most underrated directors out there, and not in the sense that people don't like his films. Most of his movies are extremely violent, bizarre, and sexual, and people mistake this for a brutality fetish. But in almost all of his films there are layers of humanistic flourishes and, surprisingly, strong undertones of feminism. \"The Bird People of China\" is a story of identity and discovery, and it is handled pretty ineptly by Miike's usually adept fingers. There is an abundance of pretty shots and there's a song that is sung by a Chinese girl throughout most of the film that is goddamn beautiful. But everything else was either lost on me or not there in the first place. Nice try, Miike.\n\nI think folks who say this movie is somehow atypical of Miike must be fairly unfamiliar with the full breadth of his work. Granted it's not hyper violent like \"Ichi the Killer\" or \"Audition\", but even most of Miike's yakuza's films are not really all that violent. The character types and dynamics and the loose unpredictability of this film feel very much like Miike. The film itself is a bit of a surprise in that it tackles some pretty familiar subject matter ... men from civilization having their character fundamentally changed by an encounter with simple rural folk ... but it takes it into slightly different territory and reaches a subtler and more complex resolution than one would expect.For those who question Miike's versatility, I present Exhibit A, The Bird People in China. Genre-bending, insightful and poetic, this film displays the great humanistic touches that contradict Miike's reputation as hyper violent and sexual filmmaker.\n\nBird People begins as a quirky, gently comic adventure story and gradually morphs into an intriguing exploration of the very nature of human emotion, loaded with symbolism, a deep, true warmth and some utterly terrific imagery. To analyze the film's rabid lust-for-life philosophy and examine the complexities of the script would take another article entirely, but in short, Miike's wild directorial flair continually pushes the question of whether technological progress, modern day civility and even spoken language itself are adversaries or allies to man's\u2026\n\nMiike's film tells a story of wonder, of finding yourself in the most unlikely of places, and of the encroachment of modernity. While most people praise this film for its lack of brutality which permeates most of the other films in Miike's cannon, as a stand alone film I found it a little underwhelming. While I enjoyed many of the themes that this film explored, I found myself at a distant from what the characters were experiencing. There is a sense of serenity that flows over much of the film. While this makes for some beautiful moments, it unfortunately makes some of the more pivotal scenes feeling lifeless and hard to really immerse yourself in. Maybe it is a cultural\u2026"}
{"text":"Mothers Against Deliberate Dying\n\nSome Mother's Son shows an uprising's confusion\n\nTerry George, the director and co-writer (with Jim Sheridan) of Some Mother's Son, has more complicated feelings about Northern Ireland than he can express coherently. They shoot out in piercing shards of action and potent gutter or pulpit rhetoric. Some Mother's Son is about the fight to save the lives of the rebel group that became known as the Ten Men Dead. It may appear to be a forthright pro-Irish saga of unjust incarceration. But it's only superficially simple. You have to keep your wits about you to step-dance through its emotional terrain -- there's a welter of conflicting attitudes in the characters as well as in the filmmakers. The movie expresses what it's like to endure unending political catastrophes. The people in this film live on survival reflexes; they hope for emergency stopgaps that can't substitute for lasting resolution. As political art, Some Mother's Son is wanting. As a document of Irish confusion, it's indelible.\n\nAt the turning point of this fact-inspired chronicle of \"the Troubles,\" a college-age boy named Gerard Quigley (Aidan Gillen), having been thrown into Ulster's Maze prison for IRA activity, joins the hunger strike that resulted in the death of Bobby Sands and nine other young rebels from May to August of 1981. (In the early '70s, George spent three years in the same prison on an arms charge.) The core of the story is the relationship between Gerard's mother, Kathleen (Helen Mirren), an anti-IRA schoolteacher, and a working-class mother, Annie Higgins (Fionnula Flanagan), whose revulsion for the British is near total. As Annie's son, Frank (David O'Hara), and Kathleen's Gerard teeter toward martyrdom, the two women petition and beg the British government to respond to the prisoners' demands and end the strike.\n\nThe mothers' affectionate alliance is a marvelous example of the surprising valences in human chemistry. Kathleen is a smart, firm woman in a \"soft,\" equivocating position. Right up to his arrest, Gerard has been able to hide his politics from her. She's horrified at the cold-bloodedness of his self-styled soldiering, and mortified when he plants a farewell kiss on her mouth to pass a written message to the Sinn Fein. Annie, on the other hand, wholly supports Frank's actions. She's already lost one son to the struggle, and she's certain that blasting the British off her island will better her lot. Kathleen, educated and worldly, is better able to articulate their sons' plight to British officials, but Annie has the scrappiness and sorority needed for a war of emotional attrition. As the turbulence behind bars runs its terrifying course, the audience, like Kathleen, gets caught up in the fervor of Annie's firebrand solidarity.\n\nGeorge's stirring depiction of the prisoners' revolt and its riotous consequences obscures the film's key idea: that destruction or self-destruction inevitably cripples a movement. The IRA inmates protest because they want to be recognized as prisoners of war, not criminals. The most critical of their five demands is the most purely symbolic: the right to wear their own clothes. George means to question whether acquiring such a right -- and, at one point, the ability to call it a right and not a privilege -- is worth risking lives. But his re-enactments of the turmoil in Maze prison and the street processions that follow is so mind-grabbing and electric that a rift develops between what the movie states explicitly and what it dramatizes.\n\nGeorge has said that the film is about the anguish of people squeezed between two extremes: the institutional violence of the British and the mystical revolutionary violence of the IRA. It plays out, though, as a battle between a liberal -- Kathleen -- and the radicals and reactionaries around her. In art, as in politics, the liberal perspective is difficult to make dynamic and appealing. Seeing Kathleen look askance at the rebels' courtroom grandstanding isn't as gut-warming as watching Annie mouth off to every authority figure in sight, whether the security forces or a nun. Early on, there's a barbed critique of Irish manly charm in Gerard's deception and manipulation of his mother Kathleen. But George never rises to the full-blooded analysis of Irish machismo that informed In the Name of the Father (which he and Sheridan also co-wrote, with Sheridan directing).\n\nStill, Some Mother's Son has impact even when it zigs and zags. In the opening minutes, George intercuts the girls in Kathleen's school pounding their way through a step dance and Gerard and Frank targeting British military vehicles with a bazooka; the sequence culminates with classroom windows shattering and a jeep and truck exploding into flames. Of course, the cutting baldly points up the cruel disruption of the peaceful school by the guerrilla war beyond its gates. But George also gets at something more mysterious -- the percussive, fatalistic nationalism shared by almost every major character except Kathleen. In another suggestive bit of cutting, George moves from the mothers crooning American pop standards to the prisoners joining arms and voices and drumming on walls.\n\nAt these times, the film has an atavistic charge that's rooted in real events. When the prison guards won't pick up the inmates' slops unless they take off their makeshift blanket robes and put on their convict uniforms, the men smear their feces on the walls and keep up their regimen of exercise and Gaelic pride. This isn't hyperbole, it's history. If anything, George is downplaying their blend of lowdown grit and high-grade nationalism in order to sustain his dramatic credibility. In The Troubles, Tim Pat Coogan writes that during this episode, \"The Irish demonstrated both their defiant natures and their sense of identity in a manner which gave new meaning to the term 'back to basics.' For example, throughout the Dirty Protest, the prisoners continued to hold Irish classes. They tapped out a word on the central-heating pipes and then inscribed it onto the walls of their cells in their own excrement, sometimes using the crucifixes on their rosary beads as stylos.\" George's audience viscerally experiences the IRA men using patriotic and religious enthusiasm to jack themselves up into a transcendental state. When Gerard first lands in Bobby Sands's prison cell and tells him he looks like Jesus, it sounds like an air-clearing quip; when Sands lies dying of starvation, after just being elected to Parliament, it's no joke."}

{"text":"The Invisible War (2012)\n\nSorry children of mine, no Army Duty for you.\n\nWhen somebody goes off to war, you know that they won't be safe, but that unsafe-element of thinking is usually when they are on the battlefield, where danger lurks at every second. However, little do you know, that most of the danger usually takes place around the actual barracks, hide-outs, safe-zones, and camps themselves, mainly because of one terrible thing, and one thing only: rape.\n\nShit, I seriously have no clue where to start this review. I'm going to come right out and say it but I have no experience whatsoever in terms of what this film is really talking about. I've never enlisted into the army, I've never been raped, I've never been a woman, I've never really been in close contact with somebody that has been raped, and most of all, I have not known a person that has raped another. So, basically, this whole review to some may seem like it's just coming from the finger-tips of a guy who has never once lived a day in any of the subjects that they are talking about shoes' and has no idea what the hell he's talking about. In a way, you may be correct, but in other way, I think you are dead, dead wrong, for one reason, and one reason only: I have the only experience needed, I'm human.\n\nSee, being human is one element that makes us what we are. Deciding what is right and what is wrong and how we can make not only ourselves better, but the others around us as well. You can live life, go on and on and on with the motions, do nothing for nobody, and end your life right then and there, but going out there, making a difference in someone's life, showing them that you care, showing them that you listen, showing them that you know, and basically, just showing them that they matter. That's what life is all about and it doesn't matter if you have ever been in-combat, have ever killed somebody, have ever been surrounded by 99% dudes and then seeing one type-of female out of the blue, and it sure as hell doesn't even matter if you have never, ever even been a victim or know somebody that has been a victim of rape. It all comes down to knowing what's right, what's wrong, and what we can do, as human-beings, to make our world a better, safer place for everyone in it.\n\nI know all of this philosophical, \"life and love rules\" mumbo-jumbo may have a bunch of you surprised as hell to see what it is that I'm pulling here, but seriously, this movie made me feel something that I haven't felt in the longest time when I watched a movie: anger. Seriously, every 4-minutes of this film that went-by, I just felt my hands gripping-up, my blood start to boil, my brows start to raise, and my mouth let out a huge, \"WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?\", and it was all meant to happen because of what director Kirby Dickputs on-display here.\n\nBefore I go any further, I have absolutely, positively no problems with the US Military. Despite all of the piss-stains that come-out in this review and the documentary itself that may make it seem otherwise, the US Military is still one of the finest in the whole, wide world. Over the years, I've come to know people that have been in-service, or are going to be and I have no problems with that whatsoever. Never for me, but hey, if it's for another person, good for them and you know what? I actually applaud you, because those are some of the bravest steps in life to take. Going to fight for your country, never knowing when you'll make it back, how you will, or even if you will. For me, that's some traumatizing shit but to the men and women of this country, who don't give a diddly-squat about it, can go-out there, serve, and fight for our country, then more love and respect towards you. Seriously, it's something I will applaud you for until the day I die.\n\nHowever, this idea of a person going off to war, fighting for our country, doing what is right, and coming home raped more than once is something that really makes me want to punch someone, something, or just whoever the hell is responsible for all of this. You have to look at it like this, we live in a society where if you are raped, commit a rape, or hear of a rape; you call the cops, they settle the whole thing, get down to the nitty-gritty of it all, find out who's responsible, go to the nearest-ends of the Earth to find that person, and eventually, have justice be served. That's the way our country roles, that's the way our society roles, that's way our world roles, and hell, that's how our human-consciences role. That's why it's so unbelievable to me that still, after years and years and years of women fighting in the service, we still have to deal with shit like rape.\n\nBut it's not just dealing with the rape itself, it's the idea that we still have to talk about it, still have to try and fight for it to end, and worst of all, actually have to tell these dim-witted a-holes that, \"Rape is bad. Bring a buddy. Ask her when she's sober\u2026\". Seriously, shit like this is still talked about, let alone actually argued between two opposing-sides. Telling people that rape is not allowed, not only in the Army, but in the world should seem like a no-brainer in and of itself, but somehow, women (and sometimes men) still find themselves raped after serving our country.\n\nThe rape-act itself is god-awful, but what's even worse, what's even more appalling, and what's even more distasteful is the fact that these power-hungry dick-heads behind the desks that have the highest-order in all of the Army, sit-back, hear the cases, ignore it, and basically act as if nothing had ever happened. Rape is bad, but acting like it never happened in the first-place, pushing it to the side so some people don't get in trouble, and making sure that that person who got raped and reported it, doesn't get any help whatsoever, whether it be medical, physical, or mental, is just downright disgusting. These people, go out there, to serve our country for more or less than 10 years and the one thing they can come back to and be promised of is that they'll have their V-Card stolen from some horny Army Sergeant with a boner! You gotta be kidding me and what makes it even worse, is that there are over, and this is just a guesstimated number, over 20,000 assaults, and not even half of them, have had the assailants jailed, punished, or disciplined in any which way. It's almost as if nothing had happened in the first-place; it's almost like this terrible act of violence is allowed because you have a couple of medals on your arms; and it's almost like it doesn't matter, mainly because you're a dude, that has a dick, that serves in the army, and has a high-chance of showing all of the corrupt bastards of the army for what they really are. Once again, I will say it, I have no problem with the men and women that serve this country, but with something like this running around rampantly, you can't help but to point some fingers and get a little heated.\n\nBut, if none of this talking\/ranting\/raving will do anything, than what the hell will? Well, going out-there, realizing what's right, what's wrong, and making the lives for the people around you is one-way to start. The subjects that Dick follows here, I highly doubt I will ever meet in my life, or hell, even know that I'm meeting, if I walk into them on the street, but that's not the point. These subjects, could literally be you, me, our mothers, our fathers, our brothers, our sister, our aunts, our uncles, anybody. Rape can happen to anybody, at any second and it can especially happen if they're serving in the army. Hopefully, just hopefully people will realize we need to put a stop to all of this hate, pain, anger, and turmoil, and just get back to doing things the way we used to, but what the hell was that way in the first-place? It's the 21st Century and problems such as rape are still prevalent in the army. When it will it stop? Who's going to stop it? When? Where? How? And most importantly, who's going to get punished for this all? There are so, so, so many questions left unanswered here and rightfully so, because they aren't, and may never be answered. All we can hope on is that people see what's in-front of them, know what is right, what is wrong, and continue to make the world a better, safer place for those around us.\n\nNow, despite all of my rambling and raving about the human-psyche and what we all have stored in our minds, let me just tell you that this is probably going to be my favorite, if not, the best documentary of the year and a shoe-in for an Oscar. Highly doubt it matters if the movie wins an Oscar, a Golden Globe, a Moon Man, or even a Grammy, because the subject-material is still as current as YouTube's Video of the Day, and it may never go. That's why I have to give a lot of love and respect to Dick for having the balls to make this movie, and even more love and respect to the people who actually participated in this, giving their thoughts, opinions, and experiences, no matter how painful they may have been.\n\nI don't think I ever found myself on the verge of tears, but this is some emotionally-heavy stuff to watch and you really feel for everybody involved, since nobody, absolutely nobody was asking for this to happen, regardless of what those high-ranking officials may say otherwise. To be honest, watching this movie ever again will never be an option for me because I think once, is quite enough and really did a number on me, my mind, and my whole thought-process as of right now since I'm so heated and angry at everything I just spent-on listening to and hearing for the past hour and 37 minutes. This is one of those documentaries that you have to, I repeat, HAVE TO be in the right-mood to watch and be gripped by, because it will really take you down a dark and heavy-road, that you cannot turn-off of.\n\nHowever, if you do give this one a try and you have the right mood, mindset, and overall, thoughts going-on throughout your head, you will be completely riveted from start-to-finish. By the end, you'll feel worn-down, tired, upset, angry, dirty, and overall, have a clearer-understanding of what's going on out there in the world we live in, and the military that protects us. I could go on and on and on about how the military has really screwed the pooch on this one, but I don't think I need to. I think a movie like this is important and powerful enough to be chosen as further-evidence as to why, and that's something I haven't said about a film, let alone, a documentary in the longest, longest-time. See it, and have your eyes opened. But never, ever watch it again.\n\n10 comments\n\nGood review bud, it is truly vile what some people do. It sucks but that is the world we live in. Even saying this there are things that SHOULD be done to help the victims or even prevent such an act happening in the military of all places."}
{"text":"Anyone familiar with the book knows its pages are sprinkled heavily with pop cultural references to songs, films and TV shows from both the early '90s era in which the story is set and beyond. The references are so prevalent, they could rightfully be described as another character in the narrative.\n\nBut how many of them made their way into what I describe in this review as a largely faithful adaptation of Chbosky's work? Here's a partial rundown.\n\n\"Asleep,\" by the Smiths\n\nIs it in the movie?: Yes.\n\nFans of the book will be relieved to know that Charlie (Logan Lerman), our gentle-yet-troubled protagonist, remains a rabid mix-tape maker in the movie, as he was in the book. (There's a particularly delightful moment where he's dubbing tape-to-tape and runs out of room on one side of his cassette, prompting him to curse and some audience members (read: me) to have massive mix-tape-composing flashbacks.)\n\nOf all the songs mentioned in the book, \"Asleep,\" by the Smiths, is the one that looms largest, its exceedingly dark lyrics almost scientifically designed for teenage brooding. If it had been omitted from the film, its absence would have been noticeably felt. Fortunately, it was not.\n\n\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\"\n\nIs it in the movie?: Yes.\n\nThe teen misfits of \"Perks\" are obsessed with \"Rocky Horror\" and perform it at midnight screenings throughout the book as well as the film.\n\nFor the record, Ezra Miller, who plays Patrick, makes an excellent Dr. Frank-N-Furter.\n\nThe many books Charlie reads\n\nAre they in the movie?: Yes, some of them are.\n\nCharlie's English teacher \u2014 played in the movie by Paul Rudd \u2014 is constantly giving him extra-credit reading assignments, slipping him such classics as \"The Great Gatsby\" and \"On the Road.\"\n\nSeveral, but not all, of them appear or are referenced in the film, including the two just mentioned and \"The Catcher in the Rye.\"\n\n\"It's a Wonderful Life\"\n\nIs it in the movie?: No.\n\nThough Charlie comments on the film in the book, it does not enter into the screen adaptation. There are some scenes that take place at Christmas, but most do not involve Charlie's interactions with his family, including his response to watching this Frank Capra Christmas staple with them.\n\nNirvana\n\nIs it in the movie?: No.\n\nThough the book is set at the height of grunge's popularity and both Patrick and Sam, played by Emma Watson, are huge fans of Kurt Cobain's band, we don't hear their music in the film. There is a passing reference to the Seattle scene, but that's about it.\n\nThe \"M*A*S*H\" finale\n\nIs it in the movie?: No.\n\nCharlie relays a significant story in the book about his memories of watching the final episode of the Korean War series with his family, an experience that carries great significance to him. It's not in the movie, though. Of all the elements in the novel, his relationship with his parents and siblings is the one given shortest cinematic shrift.\n\nPenn State\n\nIs it in the movie?: Yes.\n\nSam is desperate to go to Penn State, and Charlie's older brother plays football for the team. These details were so crucial to the Pittsburgh-set book that they remain in the film, even though the mention of the university outside of the story's 1990s context may call to mind the Jerry Sandusky scandal. To the film's credit, most will think of this for only a millisecond and then refocus.\n\n\"Heroes,\" by David Bowie\n\nIs it in the movie?: Yes.\n\nAh, trick question: Bowie's classic was not mentioned in the book, but it provides the soundtrack for two related, signature scenes in \"Perks of Being a Wallflower,\" making it as crucial to this tale of teens discovering love and liberty as that aforementioned somber Smiths song"}
{"text":"Alice is not one\nof Woody Allen's best films, but it's one of his most daring, proving beyond any\ndoubts the nearly unprecedented freedom which Allen is continually afforded. Pic\nstars Mia Farrow as a rich, unhappy woman who embarks on a journey of self-discovery.\nWhile not a novel logline, the little touches and twists Allen provides are outrageously\noriginal (for instance: it's a magical acupuncturist who sends Farrow on her voyage\nvia herbs that make her by turns, invisible, completely sexually uninhibited,\nable to fly, haunted by ghosts and the object of all men's desires). Allen quickly\nand effectively establishes the odd world in which Alice unfolds, and from that\npoint forward, Allen isn't afraid to go anywhere this woman's journey might take\nher. There are elaborate dream sequences which work equally well as efficient\ncharacterization and surreal setpieces. There is a scene in which Farrow dances\nwith the ghost of Alec Baldwin, a past lover. On the soundtrack plays a series\nof dialogue soundbytes from various moments in their relationship, all the way\nfrom when they first met, to their breakup. It's a brilliant idea to condense\nan entire relationship into a few minutes of soundtrack and Allen pulls it off\nperfectly. One of the trickiest parts of filmmaking is conveying characters' histories\nwithout resorting to easy exposition or clich\u00e9d generalities. Allen must\nbe particularly careful with his movies given his often sprawling casts and their\ncomplex interrelationships. Through devices like this soundbyting, Allen proves\nhimself always a step ahead of the pack, still figuring out innovative ways to\nadvance character and plot.\n\nWhat I like most about a movie like Alice, is that as a\nviewer, I'm never complacent. The majority of films follow so many conventions\nfrom the opening scene forward, they render themselves impotent by the twenty-minute\nmark. Since most films never even attempt to break free from their creative\nprisons, I frequently find myself settling into my seat, disheartened by the knowledge\nthat I know exactly where I'm gonna be at the close of the first two acts and\nI'm certain the ending's gonna be all ribbons and bows. But The Greatest Filmmakers\nClub (of which Allen is a premiere member) convey anything-is-possible worlds.\nBe it nuclear explosions, portals into John Malkovich's brain, frogs falling from\nthe sky or alien spaceships visiting killers on death row, nothing's out of reach\nand everything's fair game.All told, Alice is whimsical\nand fairly light, but light Allen is still preferable to the richest works of\nother filmmakers."}

{"text":"Reagan and I killed off both of our Netflix movies pretty quickly, this weekend. So, we turned to the instant queue and watched \"Man on Wire.\" This movie is CRAZY. It is about Philip Petit, and his dream to walk a tightrope between the WTC towers. I was marginally interested, from the outset, but once we got into it, I was blown away. The sheer logistics of setting up the wire without being caught were so daunting, that it made the tightrope walking itself almost seem anti-climactic. That is, until you remember that it is a dude 1 mile high, walking a freaking wire! I was also pleasantly surprised to see how many photos, and how much movie footage they had, preserving the original event. I was expecting it to be like one of those dramatic re-enactment, reminiscent of Court TV style documentaries. In all honesty, there are a few parts of the film that do incorporate that type of cheesiness. But for the most part, it is mind-blowing to watch a group of French hippies pull this thing off."}

{"text":"Valkyrie (watch the trailer) is beautifully shot by Bryan Singer and full of solid acting all around (except for Tom Cruise, who isn't horrible but is still Tom Cruise), but it never comes close to solving that one little problem. You know, the whole protagonist-getting-executed-by-Nazis-at-the-end thing.\n\nThe film tells the story of Colonel Klaus von Stauffenberg, the man who set the bomb in the final attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944. We open a year earlier on the North African front, where Stauffenberg tries to convince a general to defy Hitler's orders and abandon a doomed campaign. Just as he succeeds, Allied fighters strafe their camp, killing the general and blowing up the Jeep in which Stauffenberg sits. Singer directs the battle scene brilliantly, striking that perfect balance between realism and actually being able to see what the f-ck's going on that's so rare nowadays. Sadly, the action only lasts a few minutes.\n\nFrom there we move to Berlin, where Stauffenberg wakes up in the hospital with no right hand, no right eye (Cruise alternates between an eye patch and a glass eye, which never looks very convincing), and only two fingers on his left hand. He takes a position at Central Command under General Olbricht (Bill Nighy), who, along with General Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh), introduces Cruise to a secret committee working to assassinate Hitler. Stauffenberg's contribution to the plot is to suggest Operation Valkyrie, a contingency plan that allows for a reserve force in Berlin to take control of the government in case of an assassination attempt. In order to carry out the plan, Stauffenberg must also enlist the support of Generals Fromm (Tom Wilkinson) and Fellgiebel (Eddie Izzard).\n\nOne of the key failures of the film is that the process of enlisting co-conspirators, which should really be the central conflict in the story, is totally anti-climactic. When Cruise interviews a lieutenant who is to become his right hand man, the lieutenant (Jamie Parker) enters the office clicking his heels and shouting \"Heil Hitler!\". First thing Cruise says to him is \"We're going to be involved in treason of the highest order.\" And the lieutenant basically says, \"Hey, man, cool by me.\"\n\nKeep in mind, they've just met. They're at a job interview in Nazi Germany (you know, paranoia, secret police, mass executions, etc.). The movie makes it seem like everyone was just chomping at the bit to get in on the plan to kill Hitler, which may be true, but you'd think they'd at least ask for details. It's the same with Stauffenberg's wife. We see her and Cruise hug a lot and share meaningful glances, but there's never that conversation of, \"Okay, honey, I'm off to kill the dictator now. I hope I don't screw it up and get us all murdered.\" We're just sort of left to assume she knows what's going on and she's cool with it.\n\nIn order for the plot to succeed, a collection of people had to play their parts just so. Stauffenberg had to smuggle a bomb in, assemble it, plant it, leave the room before it exploded, and escape the base without being captured. Instead of being meticulous with these details, the film sort of glosses over them like it's in a hurry to get to the end. Thing is, we already know the ending, and it's kind of a downer. If the ending was Cruise taking off his eye patch and revealing that he was actually Kaiser Soze all along, some ambiguity might've been okay. But the closest the film ever comes to real drama is just after the assassination attempt, when army commanders in Berlin were simultaneously receiving orders from Stauffenberg that Hitler was dead and to arrest Goebbels, and orders from the SS that Hitler was alive and to arrest Stauffenberg \u2013 what's a Nazi to do! But since the commanders have no way of knowing who's telling the truth (and we know nothing about the commanders), it doesn't carry much weight.\n\nIt's not that a movie where the hero dies can't be good. It's not even that a movie with a sad ending can't be good. It's just that there has to be some compelling conflict before that. William Wallace gets tortured and executed for treason at the end of Braveheart too. The difference is, Wallace inspired his people while killing the shit out of a lot of bad guys. In Valkyrie, none of the bad guys get killed and we don't see too much inspiring going on either. In the end, it's just a failed coup, and you wonder if Stauffenberg was a hero or just a guy with good intentions who took a lot of people down with him who would've been better off just waiting another 10 months. Imagine Ocean's 11 if it ended in everyone getting thrown in jail. And with more Nazis.\n\nUPROXX Best of The Web\n\nHe takes a position at Central Command under General Olbricht (Bill Nighy)\n\nDude, does he wear his lab coat and bow tie?\n\n12.30.08 at 8:22 am\n\nHazmat\n\nI agree.

{"text":"Science Fiction\n\nArchives\n\nThe new 2012 film version of On the Road, based on the classic 1957 novel gets only 44% positive rating with critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Fans like it even less, with just 40% approval. And I know why and understand their reasons, but it's not the movie.\n\nI loved the movie, but I'm haunted by the Beats.\n\nI think director Walter Salles and screenwriter Jose Rivera, did an excellent job capturing Jack Kerouac's novel. But see, that's problematic, since the book itself is hard to like, even though it's considered one of the best American novels of the 20th century by many literary historians, and yes, hated by just as many. However, On the Road is more than a novel, it's a legend. The characters are based on real people. These people were so fascinating they became characters in many other novels by various Beat writers. Countless biographies have been written about their beat lives, and over the years films and documentaries have been made trying to capture this very tiny subculture. We're not reviewing a movie, we're reviewing mythology.\n\nThe encounter of two men, Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac generated a whole literary movement, the Beat Generation.\n\nOn the Road, came out in 1957, but was about Kerouac's real life of 1947-1949. It was essentially written by 1951, the year I was born, but tinkered with, and not published until 1957. That's a long time ago to most young movie goers today. If Kerouac had lived he'd be over ninety. So the 2012 film On the Road, is really a historical flick. It's about a bunch of unhappy crazy people who did a lot of drugs and rushed back and forth across the continent several times trying to find happiness, kicks, or just escape from their inner demons, obligations and boredom.\n\nWhen I first read On the Road in 1969, it felt contemporary because the beats were a whole lot like the hippies, at least superficially. It took me a while to realize that On the Road was about my father's generation. My dad was born in 1920, and Jack Kerouac was born in 1922. Kerouac died at 47, in October of 1969, and my dad died at 49, in May of 1970. They both died miserable drunks. They both smoked a lot of unfiltered Camels. They both travelled back and forth across America in a restless attempt to find themselves. They both were failures at marriage and raising kids. I use Kerouac to understand my uncommunicative father.\n\nWhen you're a kid and read On the Road for the first time it's tremendously exciting. It's adventurous. It's about hitch-hiking. It's about sex and drugs. It's about jazz. Yes, it's that old, before rock and roll. After doing a lot of drugs and hitch-hiking trips myself, I saw the book in a different light by 1971. I reread On the Road every few years, and the older I get, the more I understand the suffering behind the story.\n\nI wonder if the 60% of movie fans, and 56% of critics who watched On the Road are savvy enough to immediately realize that this story is about misery and not glamor? To be on the road that much, to drink that much, to take that many drugs, to fuck that many people, requires a tortured soul driven by restless, existential pain.\n\nMaybe I love this film because I read the pain in every character on the screen. This is a great film when you realize it's not a fun film. Sure, they quote Kerouac's famous lines twice in the film\nKerouac rewrote his life to make it better, to romanticize it, to make it more meaningful, more exciting, but if you read the many biographies about Jack, you know he failed to fool himself. He knew they were all beat characters. When he discovered Zen, he hoped to put a spiritual spin on things, and hoped he could find enlightenment in his life, or at least write an enlightened view of it. He failed. Alcoholism consumed Kerouac, just like my dad, my dad's brothers, and their father. I come from two beat generations.\n\nEveryone is initially seduced by Kerouac romantic spin on his life. Everyone loves Neal Cassady\/Dean Moriarty because he's so wild and bangs all the chicks, but they forget that ole Dean will abandon you in a Mexico City flophouse when you're out of your mind with dysentery and have no money, or run off and leave his wife and children to get his kicks making some other woman equally miserable. Neal was a petty criminal, street hustler, con man and user of people, but all too often people loved him. And Kerouac knew that.\n\nWhether Sam Riley as Sal Paradise (Jack Kerouac) or Garrett Hedlund as Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassady) are convincing in their roles depends on your image of Jack and Neal. I loved that the movie didn't romanticize these two. I don't think Kerouac did either in his book if you read it closely, but too many would-be beats and hippies have. I am reminded of the contrast between the 1968 book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test by Tom Wolfe, about Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters and their trip across 1964 American in an old bus named Further, and the recent documentary Magic Trip that used actual film the Pranksters took on the trip. History and nonfiction don't match up. For On the Road, history and fiction don't match either. A good writer can make real life a whole lot more glamorous than it is. I believe Kerouac wanted to chronicle his life without the glamor.\n\nWhich brings us back to modern American movie goers, they are incurable romantics. They hate realism. They embrace a comic book view of reality. That's why I think 60% of them turned their thumbs down for On the Road. That's why the film played only one week in my city, and why there was only one other person in the theater when I went. That's why they didn't like a realistic story about a struggling young writer who loves a low-life hustler and makes him the center of his novel, his life, even though time and again, the bastard left him high and dry, and crushed his soul. Kerouac wrote a lot of books, but only the ones that have Neal in them still matter. Jack returned to Neal time and again, in life and in books, but without Neal, Jack never could get his life together. Success didn't help, and only made it worse.\n\nNeal Cassady was the bus driver for Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, and Cassady brought the King of the Hippies to meet the King of the Beats. It was a disaster for the old friends. Jack and Neal are now legendary mythic characters. Trying to understand the realism of their friendship requires reading book and after book, and now watching movie after movie.\n\nI think if you're among the people trying to understand the story of Jack and Neal, you must see this film. Everyone else should be warned. If you didn't like it, then you're lucky, you don't have a beat soul. If you love it, you're among the haunted by the myths of the Beats.\n\nThis week I read The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles first published in 1949, and then I watched the 1990 film version by Bernardo Bertolucci with Debra Winger and John Malkovich. I found the novel a stunning example of writing, and the movie a stunning example of cinematography, which only made it obvious that novels are severely limited in evoking the visual world. Reading the novel, the world of Port and Kit Moresby felt claustrophobic and small, but seeing the same couple on screen, showed them living in a vast panoramic vista.\n\nIn mind, I knew Kit and Port were traveling across Algeria in the late 1940s, after WWII, so the sky should have been getting bigger and brighter as they got closer to the Sahara, but instead it got darker. That's because the story was getting psychologically darker. In fact, their world as I imagined it, was often dark, with few people and buildings. The book so reminded me of Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, that I thought Bowles must have used it as a model. In the film version of The Sheltering Sky, the streets were crowded with people, and the cities and villages were sprawling with buildings with narrow maze like streets, and everything was bright, colorful and beautiful. The gorgeous visuals overwhelmed the dark brooding characters.\n\nIt was jarring to watch the film right after reading the book because it looked nothing like what I imagined, but obviously the film looked like the world Bowles wrote about and lived in.\n\nReading The Sheltering Sky and then watching its film version made me see the difference in the two art forms. And it's not because Bowles didn't give me the information to visualize.\n\nWhen she was hungry, she rose, picked up her bag, and walked among the rocks along a path of sorts, probably made by goats, which ran parallel to the walls of the town. The sun had risen; already she felt its heat on the back of her neck. She raised the hood of her ha\u00efk. In the distance were the sounds of the town: voices crying out and dogs barking. Presently she passed beneath one of the flat-arched gates and was again in the city. No one noticed her. The market was full of black women in white robes. She went up to one of the women and took a jar of buttermilk out of her hand. When she had drunk it, the woman stood waiting to be paid. Kit frowned and stooped to open her bag. A few other women, some carrying babies at their backs, stopped to watch. She pulled a thousand-franc note out of the pile and offered it. But the woman stared at the paper and made a gesture of refusal. Kit still held it forth. Once the other had understood that no different money was to be given her, she set up a great cry and began to call for the police. The laughing women crowded in eagerly, and some of them took the proffered note, examining it with curiosity, and finally handing it back to Kit. Their language was soft and unfamiliar. A white horse trotted past; astride it sat a tall Negro in a khaki uniform, his face decorated with deep cicatrizations like a carved wooden mask. Kit broke away from the women and raised her arms toward him, expecting him to lift her up, but he looked at her askance and rode off. Several men joined the group of onlookers, and stood somewhat apart from the women, grinning. One of them, spotting the bill in her hand, stepped nearer and began to examine her and the valise with increasing interest. Like the others, he was tall, thin and very black, and he wore a ragged burnous slung across his shoulders, but his costume included a pair of dirty white European trousers instead of the long native undergarment. Approaching her, he tapped her on the arm and said something to her in Arabic; she did not understand. Then he said: \"Toi parles fran\u00e7ais?\" She did not move; she did not know what to do. \"Oui,\" she replied at length.\n\nThere is much visual detail in this passage, but I never saw it in my mind's eye. I never \"saw\" Algeria like I saw it in the film. Now that I'm reading passages from the book after seeing the movie, I'm \"reading\" it differently, and seeing it differently in my mind. This might be a clue to always see the movie first. I find the Harry Potter movies fantastic illustrations of the books, but poor substitutes for them.\n\nJust look at this film clip and then imagine how to describe in it words. Does the words camel, caravan and desert even come close to evoking what we see?\n\nWhile watching the movie I felt the soul of the novel had disappeared. The experience of reading and viewing beautifully illustrated the difference between the visual medium of film, and the world of black and white letters that are decoded inside our head. The novel is rich in details I can't see, and can't be filmed. Or can they?\n\nMovies seldom have narrative commentary. One example I can think of is the theatrical release of Blade Runner, where Harrison Ford provided a film noir detective voice over. I've always preferred the theatrical release over Ridley Scott's director's cut. I wish movie makers would experiment with unseen narrators to see if they could get closer to filming classic books. There is an aspect to books that is neither dialog or description, that is always left out of movies.\n\nI also read Hull Zero Three by Greg Bear this week and it begs for a movie treatment, or at least a graphic novel adaption. Bear describes a world that is as visually bizarre as Oz, and a spaceship with three hulls. I have no way of visualizing this story. And the novel, Hull Zero Three is written like an action film, so it feels like the soul of a novel is left out.\n\nI wonder what my reading experience of The Sheltering Sky would have been like if Paul Bowles had included National Geographic like photographs of all the locations Port and Kit visited on their trip? I know of one book that did this, Time and Again by Jack Finney, a time travel novel about 19th century New York City. The book included 19th century photographs of the city. It made a huge difference to the story. I wonder how I would have experienced Hull Zero Three differently if Bear had commissioned illustrations for his book?\n\nI assume writers expect readers to do all the mental cinematography themselves, but I don't think it would hurt if they provided a few seed images. I've talked to many readers who claim to hate movies of their favorite stories because it ruins their own mental images they have created. I think my problem is I don't visualize books as I read them, and illustrations and photographs would be helpful crutches for people like me.\n\nI recommend creating your own experiments to test the visual powers of novels. Would the monster hit TV show Downton Abbey be as popular if it was just a novel, without all the beautiful visuals? And think about all the many visual interpretations of Sherlock Holmes? There are many film versions of classic books Little Women and Pride and Prejudice. Try reading the books before or after seeing the movies and see for yourself the visual limitations of novels.\n\nYesterday I got in a Blu-ray copy of The Big Trail, an early widescreen movie from 1930. The Big Trail has quite a fascinating history behind it. Starting in the late 1920s Hollywood began experimenting with widescreen and Technicolor, but the depression killed off interest in these technologies, especially widescreen because it required special theaters, screens and projectors. The Big Trail was filmed from April to August in 1930 in black and white using both 70mm and 35mm cameras, creating two unique versions from different camera angles. The whole production was also shot in five languages using different lineup of actors for each language.\n\nEpic production doesn't begin to describe the making of The Big Trail. Seven different states were used for film locations, covering 4,300 miles, traveling in 123 baggage cars, with 93 principle actors, 2,000 extras at all the locations, 725 Indians from five tribes, 12 Indian guides, 22 cameramen, 1,800 cattle, 1,400 horses, 500 buffalo, 185 wagons and a production staff of 200. And they had the wagon train do everything wagon trains did back in those pioneering days, cross rivers, get lowered down cliffs, blaze trails through timbered lands, cross deserts, climb mountains, survive snow storms. All other wagon train movies since have been puny in scale. The Big Trail was a very gigantic production, but it's not as famous as Gone With the Wind from 1939. That's too bad, it should be better remembered.\n\nI had to watch The Big Trail alone last night because none of my movie friends like old black and white films and I couldn't convince them to give The Big Trail a try. What a loss for them. It's a shame because as soon as I started up The Big Trail I was stunned by it's beauty. Old movies are in a square format and seeing this movie in widescreen format on my 56\" HDTV made my heart ache. If only this 70mm widescreen format had caught on in 1930. All my favorite old films from the 1930s and 1940s would have been so much more grandeur looking. And that's what Fox called their experimental format, the \"Fox Grandeur\" process. What if Grand Hotel had been widescreen, or The Maltese Falcon, or The Wizard of Oz, just imagine how more magnificent they would have been.\n\nModern movie goers are used to high tech visual productions and when they see old movies, especially silent films and films from the 1930s, they think of them as primitive and crude, and often assume people of those days saw what we see today. Their technology was older and less sophisticated, but the prints we have are old and in bad shape compared to the original pristine prints audiences viewed in their day. Silent movie film goers didn't see jerky prints with faded splotches and lines running through them. They were sharp and vivid with wonderful contrast and the motion was as natural as modern films. Sure the acting style is strange to us, but the acting style was normal to them. It was great acting by the way they judged acting.\n\nOld movies are being restored all the time now, especially for the Turner Classic Movie crowd and Blu-ray movie fans. The restoration of The Big Trail is far from perfect, but I found it impressive to watch visually. I expect someday that digital processing will clean up even more of these film defects, and created a print closer to the 1930 original. For the most part the defects weren't distracting. A couple of times I thought it was raining because of the tiny scratches.\n\nThe Big Trail was an experiment in many ways, not only for the widescreen filming. It was an early epic western about settlers crossing the country in a huge wagon train. The Big Trail was the first starring role for John Wayne, but many of the actors were from Broadway, because it was an early talky and they needed actors that could project their voices to outdoor microphones. Much of the dialog is stagey, and the cinematography is reminiscent of great silent films. Yet, the sets and costumes look very realistic. It would take another 60 years before citizens of the pioneering west looked so realistically dirty and grungy. Plus the Indians were real. Often the wagons were drawn by oxen and cattle rather than horses.\n\nWesterns weren't this good for a long time, not until Stagecoach, ten years later. Most westerns of that era were B movies, short full of action, produced from very small budgets. As I watched The Big Trail, I wondered how many people living in 1930 had once traveled across the country in a wagon train. The heyday of the wagon train was from the 1840 to the 1860s, when the continental railroad was built. It was possible that some of these pioneers were still alive to verify the realism of the film. I wonder if any of them wrote about it?\n\nWesterns today, 80 years later, often work hard to appear realistic and historical. It seems like every decade has a different view on how the old west looked. Just compare the two versions of True Grit. There's also a difference in how violence was portrayed. In The Big Trail, John Wayne only kills one of the bad guys, and with a knife. And the bad guys were on the hesitant and cowardly side, only willing to kill when no one was looking. Nobody was a great shot either. Today's westerns have heroes that kill as many people as a mass murderer.\n\nThe Big Trail was an innocent portrayal of pioneers. At one point the John Wayne character was telling a bunch of boys what all he learned from living with the Indians and one of the kids asked, \"Did they teach you were papooses come from?\" That's about as risqu\u00e9 as this movie got. But it was realistic enough to show a woman nursing a baby. And I thought the love conflict was reasonably sophisticated for a movie of its time. The plot of The Big Trail was gentile and slow. I'm not sure people only used to modern films would like it. Modern audiences are addicted to fast action, fast dialog, and lots of plot twists. I've seen The Big Trail three times now and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. It's a classic western, and a classic 1930s film, my two favorite genres.\n\nI grew up in the 1950s on a steady diet of western movies and TV shows. The western is my favorite movie genre, and sadly few are made anymore, so I was really looking forward to Django Unchained. That was before Sandy Hook. And even before the mass child killings in Newtown, Connecticut, I worried that Django Unchained was going to be too violent and over the top. I love realistic westerns, or at least westerns that feel historical. Watching the trailer to Django Unchained didn't remind me of any history I knew about. It's a strange revisionist fantasy of 19th century America.\n\nTrue Grit and Open Range were good westerns in my book, but I have to admit there's little real history in westerns. Westerns are a genre that teaches us that guns are the answer to social conflict. Westerns are Darwinian tales about the survival of the fittest, but in the 1950s, westerns were stories about the fittest bringing civilization to the west. In modern westerns, civilization isn't the focus, but gun play. It's still good versus evil, but the good guys are pretty much as vicious as the bad guys.\n\nThe trouble with modern westerns is they often are just gun porn, and from the previews and what I've read, it appears that Django Unchained is a killing fantasy like a sex fantasy. Pornography is hard to define, but for me, porn films are those which merely press our brain buttons and set off our neural programming for sex, violence and fear, providing little else artistically and intellectually. In the old days if films showed actual sex or violence they were deemed pornographic and illegal. Over the years we've accepted more sex and violence in movies because the sex and deaths were artificial. We called it art. But art can push them same buttons as real sex and snuff films.\n\nMovie makers want to make millions so they need big audiences, and action movies with massive body counts are among the top selling films. Such films need a bad guy that filmmakers can manipulate the audience into hating. And since our love for violence seems to have no bounds, movie makers need really evil bad guys to justify the extreme violence they wish to recreate on the screen. Django Unchained selects slavers in the Old South. These guys were plenty evil, so no one will feel bad if we watched them get killed in horrible ways. And evidently Quentin Tarantino didn't feel actual historical slavers were evil enough, so he made them even more repulsive in his film, so the audience could enjoy watching them be punished with an orgy of good clean gun killing fun. What an emotional release it must be to see those slavers get their retribution. But is enjoying that retribution divine or evil?\n\nNow I'm not saying I wouldn't have enjoyed Django Unchained, because I probably would, I've been conditioned by decades of violent movies. I'm not going to see Django Unchained because part of me is telling myself that it's sick and disturbing to be enjoying such gluttony of violence, in the same way part of me tells myself I can't gorge on Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream. Too much of anything is bad.\n\nI don't plan on giving up all violent movies, or westerns. However, I need violence to be presented realistically. We should be shocked and horrified by violence, not getting off on it. Gun porn is just giving the little angry guy inside of us a hand job.\n\nI read three books this year that covered the subject of slavery and violence in America around the time of the Civil War. Midnight Rising by Tony Horowitz, about John Brown the abolitionist terrorist, Reconstruction by Eric Foner about the horrors of the South after the Civil War, and Freeman by Leonard Pitts, Jr., a novel about a freed black slave returning to the South to find his wife after the Civil War ends.\n\nReading the lengthy plot summary of Django Unchained on Wikipedia and looking that the previews on YouTube convinces me that Tarantino's history of this time period is some kind of strange fantasy created to justify the gun violence. Movie goers will not learn any history about slavery or the Civil War South, just like they didn't learn anything about WWII from Inglourious Bastards. Where is the justifying art?\n\nIn fact, if you wanted to make an artistic anti-slavery film Mr. Tarantino, there's actual slavery going on in the world today that needs our focus of attention.\n\nThe real issue is how we use fiction. Fiction has always been about entertainment, and it's always manipulated us by pushing our emotional buttons. If fiction is high art we should learn something about reality, people and ourselves. Fiction should not masturbate our base instincts, but isn't that what much of fiction has become? Low art. Our most powerful instinct is to reproduce, so most films deal with sex and romance. However, instead of dealing with them as a topic for enlightenment, all too often films just stimulate our urge for intense romance and hot sex.\n\nWe are all animals with a strong fight or flight instincts. Most violent and horror movies stimulate that deep biological programming. Fiction is based on conflict, and the plot must go through several stages before bringing its audience to a release of tension, which for gun porn usually involves the hero killing more and more people \u2013 a mass killer. On screen body counts have gotten ridiculous. Action violence is choreographed like live action cartoons, so unreal they are on the level of Roadrunner cartoons and Three Stooges films. Can anyone really watch The Expendables 2 without feeling insulted?\n\nOur world is full of real violence, so why do we need pseudo violence to thrill us? Even if television news wasn't presenting us weekly stories on mass murders, isn't it time to wonder about why gun porn is so entertaining? Have we seen so many fictional killings that only visions of extreme slaughters can thrill us? Haven't we become so jaded to violence if it takes the Sandy Hook killings to make us question violence in our society?\n\nMaybe I'm just getting old and my testosterone is petering out, but gun porn has gotten too absurd. I just can't ethically rationalize enjoying the big screen killings to myself anymore. I'm not immune to the thrill of violence. I can still rationalize Breaking Bad because the show is not about violence, but about a good man becoming evil, and there are many episodes where people don't get killed, and when they do it's horrifying. To me, films like Django Unchained are only about the thrill of violence, and other aspects to the story are just straight men setting us up for the high caliber penetrating punch line.\n\nI'm tired of pretending it's all in good fun. I'm not even suggesting that these films escalate violence in our society. I'm asking: Isn't it weird we get so much fun out of watching people being killed?\n\nLast night I was going through my DVDs looking for something to watch and popped in The Matrix. The opening scene is of the police trying to arrest Trinity. It had some pistol shots, and I immediately thought of Sandy Hook. I felt guilty watching the movie. I watched a little longer because the shooting was over, but as I watched I remembered the scene where Neo rescues Morpheus in an orgy of semi-automatic and automatic weapons violence. I had to turn off the movie. I knew as soon as the assault rifles showed up I'd imagine their bullets impacting little bodies of six and seven year old girls and boys.\n\nSandy Hook is my turning point for rejecting violence in our society, like Hurricane Sandy is the turning point for many about climate change.\n\nWe're all asking ourselves how can anyone become a mass murderer of children? That's too monstrous to comprehend much less accept. But this is after decades of accepting other kinds of violence as part of our ordinary life. Haven't we long taken serial killers, terrorists, gangs, drug cartels for granted? There have always been terrorists, serial killers and even mass murderers, but the horror of their crimes keeps growing bigger and bigger. When will this escalation of violence end? How much can we accept before it drives us all into a terminal depression? If we don't do something, then we will accept mass murder of children as part of life too.\n\nAnd I'm afraid watching violent movies, television shows and video games is a form of acceptance. If we could plot the rise of violence in our society with the rise of violence in the movies I bet the lines would parallel each other on the chart. And if we also plotted the number of weapons and kinds of fire power civilians now own, that graph would match the others.\n\nWhen I was growing up policemen carried revolvers and automatic weapons were carefully controlled. The average citizen couldn't own machine guns. If people owned a gun for protection it was usually a simple .38 Smith & Wesson or a small .410 shotgun. Now families have whole military arsenals including assault rifles with extended clips. In the 1950s movie action heroes were cowboys that carried a single pistol on his hip. Now action heroes blaze away with assault rifles cradled in each arm, and when their ammunition runs out, whip out two large semi-automatic handguns from concealed holsters. Both in real life and screen life, we can't seem to get enough firepower. What are we afraid of?\n\nI was looking forward to the new western by Quentin Tarantino that comes out Christmas, but after Sandy Hook I can't handle any more violence, real or fun. And isn't it weird we accept so much violence as fun? Something is wrong with us.\n\nAre all those assault rifles and semi-automatic pistols in movies just product placement for arms dealers? Have the arms industry just shifted it sales from warring countries to American consumers? When average Americans feels the need for night vision goggles and laser scopes, I have to wonder who is promoting those sales and what emotions are they playing upon.\n\nI used to believe that there was no correlation between violent video games and movies and real life violence, but I've changed my mind. Hurricane Sandy and Sandy Hook are warnings about the future. Our environment is overheating in both weather and violence.\n\nSometimes we vote in a polling station, but most of the times we vote with our dollars. Sorry Mr. Tarantino, but you and other action film makers have taken violence for escapist fun too far. I think some of our gun fantasies have become porn and we need to classify them XXX and keep them away from people under 21.\n\nBut what level of gun violence is obscene? Back in ancient Greece, they believed violence should occur off stage. Sometime between 400 BC and now we've crossed a line. I think it's time to think about where that line should be and return to an earlier standard of violence in art. We've gone too far.\n\nDirector Ang Lee and screenwriter David Magee have done an excellent job of adapting Yann Martel's 2001 novel Life of Pi to film. When I read the book back in 2004 I thought at the time it would never be made into a film because the novel was too cerebral, too narrative heavy, plus, how could anyone get a tiger to do all that acting?\n\nLife of Pi the film covered a surprising amount of the content of Life of Pi the book. So far I can think of just three scenes I missed. First, story of Pi's family running into Pi's three religious leaders. Second, showing how Pi used turtles to survive, and finally, the scene where Pi is blind and hears people in another life raft.\n\nStill, Lee and Magee beautifully succeeded with capturing the philosophical heart of the novel. If you loved the book, go see the film, you'll be surprised by how well it was filmed.\n\nIs God the Better Story?\n\nIf you haven't read the book or seen the movie, don't read beyond this point if you plan do either, because I'm going to analyze the philosophical statement of the book and it will spoil the story.\n\nIn the main story, a boy from India, Piscine Molitor Patel, who wants to be called Pi, is shipwreck in a lifeboat with a zebra, orangutan, hyena and a tiger named Richard Parker. Martel tells us this story very realistically and we are expected to believe it happened. But along the way, Martel takes us through scenes that are very hard to believe, like the carnivorous island with the meerkats.\n\nYann Martel has crafted a Zen k\u014dan into a novel. Most k\u014dans are short, \"What is the sound of one hand clapping.\" Yann Martel essentially asks, \"Is God the better story?\"\n\nAt the beginning of the novel and movie, in a pseudo introduction, the author is told by an older Pi, that he can tell the author a story that will make him believe in God. Yann Martel creates two stories, one very long, elaborate, fantastic, awe inspiring \u2013 and brutal, and a second that is short and brutal. We are asked which one we prefer. Martel is right, everyone, including realists like me, will pick the story with Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger.\n\nSo where does God come in? How can this story make us believe in God? Analyzing fiction for symbolism is tricky, but for me, Richard Parker represents God though analogy. At the end of the film and novel, when Pi has told his long fabulist story to two Japanese insurance investigators they refuse to believe him. So Pi tells a shorter, ugly version that we know is true, but hate to believe. Then Pi asks the investigators which story they prefer.\n\nWe all want to believe in the story where Richard Parker existed because it's a better story than the one of madness, murder and cannibalism.\n\nSo what about the prediction at the beginning, that the story will make us believe in God? I believe Yann Martel uses the desire to believe in Richard Parker as a stand in for God, creating an analogy, that the readers and audience must make on their own. Pi desperately wants to believe in God. Pi asks us to believe in Richard Parker because the story of surviving in a lifeboat with a tiger is a better story than going mad and surviving alone.\n\nThe whole point of the novel is to trick the reader into the question: Which story do you prefer. Of course everyone prefers Richard Parker to be real. By transference, we're ask to accept that belief in God is the better story, just like how we want to believe that Richard Parker existed. We're never explicitly told that wanting to believe in Richard Parker is the same as wanting to believe in God, but I feel it's obvious.\n\nYann Martel tells us people prefer religion over reality because the story of God is a better story than reality. And I ask: \"Is this why people refuse to accept the fact of evolution because they prefer the story with Richard Parker \u2013 oh, I mean God?\"\n\nThe novel is an elaborate metaphor to explain why people believe in God. It doesn't say that God exists. Nor do we know what Yann Martel believes. It just says people prefers belief in God because it's a better story than how we see reality directly.\n\nWhat the novel is tricking us into confessing is that the belief in God, no matter how unbelievable that story might be, that it's a better story than reality. That when we're pushed to the ends of our physical and mental limits, we want God even if he's cruel, vicious and indifferent. That the belief in God is what gets us through this life.\n\nHas Yann Martel stacked the deck? Is God the better story? Yes, reality does sometime involve madness, murder and cannibalism. And even in the God story, people die, animals are cruelly killed and eaten, people suffer. If the audience was given the Richard Parker story, and a documentary about the evolution of the universe with cosmology and the evolution of life on Earth with evolutionary biology, is God still the better story. I don't think so. Richard Parker is like a magician's diversion. If you could watch this movie and blot out the tiger, the reality of Earth is magnificent! Richard Parker and God divert our attention to our fantastic reality.\n\nGod is only the better story when you don't understand reality. Richard Parker is ferocious, terrifying, cruel, indifferent and doesn't answer prayers. No matter how much Pi loves Richard Parker and wants his recognition, Richard Parker ultimately refuses to acknowledge Pi's existence.\n\nSo why is God the better story if Richard Parker just walks away from us? I know many people who have long given up religion but haven't given up on God. They say that God must have created us but walked away from the universe and is no longer involved. Personally, I'm confident there is no God and the size, age and origin of reality is beyond our understanding. I find it far more comforting to know the rules of our local universe and not feel the need to blame a superior being for bad things or beg for good things. If a bacteria, shark, drunk driver hurts me badly, I just accept it was the luck of the draw and not a judgmental deity deciding I had done something wrong.\n\nWhere the metaphor of Richard Parker breaks down is Pi can see Richard Parker, and we never see God. It's actually easier to believe in Richard Parker than it is to believe on God. Life of Pi is a wonderful novel. I've read I twice now. And each time I want to believe the Richard Parker story, even though I know the truth is the story about cannibalism. How many times will I have to read this book before the realistic story is the better story?\n\nWhat if the novel and movie had been about a boy that survived 227 days on the ocean and had endured the incident with cannibalism and madness and survived. No tiger, no zebra, no hyena, no orangutan, just Pi, his mom, the Frenchman and the Buddhist sailor? It would have been brutal, but the success of Pi surviving the ordeal would have been just as magnificent.\n\nWhy do we want a better story? Santa Claus is a better story than parents buying kids Christmas gifts from Target. The Easter Bunny is a better story than throwing milk teeth in the garbage. Heaven is a better story than dying. But why is God a better story than reality? Is God a better story than evolution? If you understood evolution and cosmology, God isn't the better story. God is a simpler story, and God's story is endlessly confusing and contradictory. It's just God is fantastically powerful like Richard Parker.\n\nEven though I disagree with Yann Martel's assertion, I love his fiction. See, that's the real revelation in this. Fiction is the better story, and Life of Pi is very good fiction. Humans embraces fiction with an intense passion. Richard Parker is a better character than a cannibalistic Frenchman. And for many people, all the stories about God, are a better story than the brutal aspects of reality. However, there is nothing in fiction that comes within light years of evolution. All stories about God are just crude children stories compared to the complexity and beauty of evolution. Evolution is just as brutal as the Old Testament God \u2013 it's just not personal.\n\nHere's the final k\u014dan: Did Yann Martel write this story to make us atheists or make us believers in fiction?\n\nYesterday I saw Cloud Atlas at the theater, and it had previews for The Life of Pi and The Hobbit. I've also seen recent previews for Anna Karenina. All books I've read. While watching the preview for The Life of Pi I wondered what Yann Martel and David Mitchell are feeling now that their words have become movies. Do they feel like gods creating new worlds?\n\nLucky writers type words on their computer and a few years later those words become images on the big screen. How marvelous must that feel for a writer? Of course, a writer creates all their characters and scenes in their head by themselves, and a movie requires hundreds, if not thousands of people to create images on the screen for us to see. And often, they aren't the same visions the writer first imagined. I can't imagine David Mitchell picturing so many of his characters looking like Tom Hanks, but Tom Hanks with the help of make-up artists have fleshed out Mitchell's characters in a world of pixels that is so much more vivid than printed words on a page.\n\nI have to admit while watching the previews that I wished I could write something worthy of filming. Few books are given birth on the big screen, so it's a very rare honor that few writers get to enjoy.\n\nLook at the opening page of Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell \u2013 I saw it acted out yesterday. It's not the same at all, these words inspired a movie scene on the beach.\n\nThese are just two examples. I wish I had the time and technology to show several examples, with the exact book pages and filmed scenes. Both Cloud Atlas and The Life of Pi are books of astounding feats of imagination. I'm sure bookworms hope all their favorite books will become films, but few do. I'd love to see The Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi made into a movie. That book also exhibited tremendous feats of imagination, although it's a bleak view of the future. I'm thinking movie makers prefer upbeat stories based on fantastic events.\n\nI wonder how many writers sit down to write a story they hope will be filmed? If you've read Cloud Atlas or The Life of Pi, you probably thought like me at the time that it would be impossible to film these stories. Watching the preview of The Life of Pi made me realize that anything a writer can think up movie makers can film. Watching the preview of Anna Karenina made me realize that movie makers are going far beyond what writers can do with words. I don't think any one mind can imagine so much beauty, color and vivid detail.\n\nLook at this photo and then read Tolstoy's words:\n\nAnna was not in lilac, the colour Kitty was so sure she ought to have worn, but in a low-necked black velvet dress which exposed her full shoulder and bosom that seemed carved out of old ivory, and her rounded arms with the very small hands. Her dress was richly trimmed with Venetian lace. In her black hair, all her own, she wore a little garland of pansies, and in her girdle, among the lace, a bunch of the same flowers. Her coiffure was very unobtrusive. The only noticeable things about it were the wilful ringlets that always escaped at her temples and on the nape of her neck and added to her beauty. Round her finely chiselled neck she wore a string of pearls.\n\nWell, they got the ringlets. Can any words ever describe what we actually see? What is the power of Tolstoy's words that have made Anna Karenina one of the greatest novels of all time? It is a novel that has inspired the production of many movies. Will there be additional productions of The Life of Pi and Cloud Atlas? Will Martel and Mitchell be as inspiring as Tolstoy?\n\nLike I said, I wish I could write a story other people felt compelled to film. The old saying is, a picture is worth a thousand words, well that means most novels have about 100 pictures in them. But novels are really about characters fighting adversity, and that's where movies and books really overlap. I believe if I wanted to write a novel worth filming, I'd need to create unique characters facing unique conflicts. Words are great for that.\n\nI think it's fascinating to read the words that become movies. I think it's even more fascinating see characters on pages become characters on screen. I think it's also fascinating for stories to come alive before our eyes in the dark that we once read as black marks on white pages.\n\n[By the way, is film even a valid word to use regarding movies anymore? Are movies still filmed? Or do they use high resolution video cameras? In our modern times both novels and movies appear on screens. I guess I could have talked about stories that appear in black and white on small screens and in color on large screens. Is that the transformation good stories should expect \u2013 more pixels with great color depth?]\n\nIt is impossible to express how beautiful Samsara is to see on a big screen. If you've seen Baraka or Chronos at the theater, then you'll have the best idea of what you are in store for visually. And this film is all about visuals. It's a documentary without narrative. Beautiful hypnotic music, gorgeous exotic music, lush sacred music adds to the impact of the visuals, but this film is all about seeing.\n\nIf a picture is worth a thousand words, your mind will race through an encyclopedia worth of words as you watch Samsara. It's a rush.\n\nI can't emphasize this enough, but to truly experience this film you need to go see it in a theater. I have Baraka on DVD and watch it on a 56\" TV, and I love it. But it's not the full experience. Nothing I can say can convey the full impact of the film. No photograph or film clip does the film justice.\n\nNow I warn you, this is an intensely intellectual film, even though it has no words. Many people, will find it boring \u2013 if you have a fascination about this reality we live in, then your lifetime of thoughts will make this film great. Your mind will create a narrative as you watch. This show is a head trip, and your thoughts will script the film as you watch. You'll write it different every time you watch it. The many scenes from around the world are meant to trigger deep philosophical responses.\n\nSamsara will probably only play one week in your town, so if its on, go see it while you can.\n\nBe sure and set this clip to the highest resolution and watch it full screen. Or visit the official site and watch the clip there.\n\nSamsara was filmed in 25 countries with 70mm film, and converted to digital with a 8k scan, creating a 20 terabyte file. That's a lot of details to shoot up into your brain in one hour and thirty-nine minutes. Most Blu-Ray films come in around 20 gigabytes, so Samsara has a 1,000 times more bytes of detail.\n\nSamsara is a spiritual ride around the globe, zooming in on monasteries and prisons, jungles and deserts, slums and hi-rises, the poor and the rich, the beautiful and the grotesque, the living and the dead, a baby in the womb, and people in their coffins.\n\nSamsara and Baraka shows how immensely diverse our world is. It makes you realize that your view of reality, the one you're so obsessed with, is really so very small. Just before Samsara came on tonight they had a preview for The Hobbit. That preview entices movie goers to come see a fantasy world rich in landscape and full of colorful fantasy beings. It was a thrilling preview until Samsara came on. The real world Samsara made the fantasy world of The Hobbit seem pathetic and dull.\n\nIt's very hard to describe Samsara because it doesn't stay on any scene for very long. Each clip is glimpse of a subculture from around the world. Only a well traveled world traveler will know about most of these sites and people. There's even a humorous look of gun owners from around the globe, and beautiful sequences of bullet manufacturing.\n\nSamsara spends quite a lot of time showing exotic locations of religious worship. This was also true of Baraka. I believe the filmmakers must be very spiritual people, but I see what they show in a different light. I see the temples as relics of history, and their worshipers as primitive souls trying to hang onto a dying past in our fast pace world that's constantly changing. Our modern world, shown at night, looks like red blood cells coursing through veins.\n\nThe Buddhist monks carefully create a mandala with colored sand, but in the end they destroy their creation. I assume to make it again the next day. That focus on creating the details in the image is a kind of worship, or prayer. Filming Samsara is the same kind of worship.\n\nThere will be scenes that might shock, disturb or disgust you, but they are all filmed so beautifully that I have to assume that the filmmakers see everything on Earth in a spiritual light. Many of the scenes are just exotic people that live their lives so much different from ours. Seeing the film makes me realize how parochial I am.\n\nIf Samsara isn't at a nearby theater, then buy Baraka on Blu-Ray. You can watch the entire film online, to get some idea of how Ron Fricke sees the world. Watch it at least long enough to study the faces of the snow monkeys bathing in the warm water. Think about how they see this world. Think of the snow monkey watching this film like an alien from outer space seeing our world for the first time. I've watch Baraka many times now, and I want to be the snow monkey.\n\nSamsara and Baraka will not appeal to a lot of people. I'm sorry that's so. People really should spend one evening watching a movie that so much different from their usual multiplex fare. Take a trip around the real world, it's more far-out than any CGI world ever created \u2013 even Avatar.\n\nAs a Saturday afternoon science fiction adventure I'd give Prometheus a generous B. I enjoyed the film despite all the illogical thinking and action that drives the plot. The visuals are stunning. Great android character, and I always love a good artificial being. Appealing captain character, good hearted, but a bit clich\u00e9d. Not much other characterization, but the film flowed and kept my interest. Hope I'm not damning it with faint praise, but it's that kind of flick. Fun enough, but don't think about it too much. It's pretty weird when the most appealing character is an android.\n\nPrometheus is set in the same universe as Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) and all the other sequels, yet it's not exactly a prequel or a reboot, and for the most part it's not like the other movies. Prometheus has a new storyline and characters, with much better special effects. It does mirror some plotting of the original Alien, even down to some very specific outcomes.\n\nWe don't get many space adventure movies anymore. Usually it's invaders coming to Earth. I miss movies where we go to alien worlds, so that explains why I enjoyed Prometheus so much, absence make the heart grow fonder. Space epics are about as common as westerns, my favorite movie genre. So if you're up for a space opera, Prometheus might satisfy you \u2013 if you're not too picky.\n\nDon't read any further if you haven't seen the movie, because I am picky, and I'm going to give everything away when I dissect the science fiction in Prometheus.\n\nThe Analysis with Spoilers\n\nScience fiction is generally an idea genre, and the story has to make sense to the readers and watchers, even if its about something impossible like The Matrix or Inception. Prometheus is based on the idea that aliens seeded Earth with DNA. Now panspermia is an old idea, and Prometheus deals with directed panspermia. As a concept it's rather farfetched, but I don't have any trouble using directed panspermia as a plot device. But other factors in Prometheus hint at Chariot of the Gods by Erich von D\u00e4niken, which suggests ancient alien astronauts took a direct involvement with human development and claims that early humans couldn't have done things without alien help, like build the pyramids. That I found offensive, so my hackles were up for any sign on von D\u00e4nikenisms. For whatever reason, the aliens that left the maps are dubbed The Engineers. At this point in the movie, the humans don't know about the DNA, only the maps, and maybe implied interaction with ancient humans, so why call them The Engineers?\n\nIn Prometheus we are told the archaeologists Shaw and Holloway discover several ancient human cultures that have star maps that all reveal the same location. We aren't told the nature of these star maps, which are unrealistically vague. We must infer that:\n\nAncient humans observed spaceships coming from this location in the sky\n\nThe Engineers caused a certain pattern to appear in the sky that was more obvious than stars\n\nThe Engineers gave the humans the maps to tell where they came from\n\nThe Engineers gave the humans the maps so future humans would travel there someday\n\nSome Engineers are warning humans about other Engineers.\n\nClue #1.We are shown an ancient Engineer seeding the Earth, and we assume it's before life started. We are not shown the Engineers appearing to ancient cultures, but isn't that implied if several ancient human cultures have the same map?\n\nContention #1. The archaeological evidence provides enough information to direct modern humans to the star system with the moon LV-223. This is very bogus and hard to believe from the evidence we are shown. If all of these ancient human sites held an actual alien star map that we could decipher, then that might be believable. But several smudges carved in stone like a constellation pattern is not enough information.\n\nContention #2. The Engineers left a map to their home world. In all first contact stories both aliens and humans are always worried about giving the location of their home world. At this time the humans of the story do not know the Engineers left DNA seeding the Earth. All they know about is the maps. Again, why do they call them The Engineers? Do they believe the they were ancient alien engineers who built early civilizations on Earth?\n\nContention #3. Shaw and Holloway want to meet The Engineers to ask them why? The implication is its an ontological question. That they are calling these aliens The Engineers because they created us. Later on in the movie David asks Holloway why he wants to meet his makers and Holloway replies he wants to ask why. And David asks why did humans create him, and Holloway replies because we could. Then David asks, will that answer be acceptable to you? Religious people, and people who believe in Intelligent Design feel humans must have a purpose. Shaw and Holloway feel The Engineers might reveal our purpose. I feel that's both bogus and nasty. Is there any purpose we can be told that won't offend us? Any prescribed purpose will make us a slave. Do we really want to be the children of superior aliens?\n\nClue #2. The map leads the humans to a world where The Engineers were building biological weapons of mass destruction. This doesn't make sense either. Who gives directions to their secret military bases? Could a group of good Engineers have gone to Earth to warn us about evil Engineers? This makes sense but the movie never suggests that. Are they holding back for the sequel?\n\nContention #3. The Engineers have DNA that matches ours, and they look like us, and one of them gave his all to seed Earth with his DNA, so they are our makers? Actually, if you dropped off some DNA strands in a sterile ocean I doubt they would do anything. Panspermia depends on the initial building blocks of evolution to come from outside of the Earth. This ain't that. Nor is there any reason to believe if they put the starting ingredients in our ocean, that billions of years later humans that look like them would appear on the scene. Evolution and DNA don't work that way.\n\nClue #3. The reawaken Engineer immediately sees the humans and starts killing them. If the Engineers seeded many worlds how would they know if humans were from the evil Earth they wanted to destroy or from one of the good planets they wanted to preserve? Why would a species that looks like us want to kill us? We assume the target is Earth because the android David discovered how to read their computer system. If renegade good Engineers created humans maybe bad Engineers would always want to kill them on site. But does that make us the cockroaches of the galaxy? Maybe the renegade Engineers are trying to create the saviors of the galaxy \u2013 us!\n\nContention #4. The Engineers created H. R. Giger killer alien and they were stockpiling the black goo that would be used to infect the Earth. How long has the Engineer's ship lain dormant on LV-223? Why was Earth up for destruction? The movie is named Prometheus, and the spaceship is named Prometheus, but are we to assume the Engineer that seeded the Earth is a Prometheus? Remember your mythology. Prometheus brought fire to the humans and was eternally punished by his fellow gods by having an eagle feed on his liver. If the Engineer Prometheus defied his fellow Engineers to bring DNA to Earth, why would any of these ancient human cultures know about the Engineers? If they seeded the Earth before life existed, it would be billions of years before these ancient cultures even existed. If the Engineers came back to give them star maps, then the Engineers have been keeping an eye on Earth for a very long time indeed. Then why do they want to destroy it? Again this points to two factions of Engineers.\n\nClue #4. The Engineers were overrun by the H. R. Giger aliens, so they weren't smart enough to protect themselves from their own weapon. The human ship Prometheus is fairly easily able to destroy the Engineer's ship heading for Earth, so they aren't all that powerful. And an ancient Engineer attacks a disabled Shaw but she's able enough to fend him off long enough to sic the alien octopus on him. These ancient Engineers aren't that capable, or they are damn unlucky.\n\nContention #5. Shaw and David the android know where the Engineer home world is and know how to fly an Engineer ship to it. Shaw wants to know why they wanted to attack Earth with the H. R. Giger aliens. We won't know the results of this point until the sequel comes up, but it's not the conclusion I would have made. Why didn't Shaw go, \"Fuck the Engineers, we're flying to their home world to deliver they payload they intended for us.\" Why does Shaw continue to believe the Engineers has something to tell us? Isn't finding the plans and munitions to destroy Earth enough of a message? My gut reaction was much different from Shaw's. It would have been the same as Lester del Rey's \"For I Am a Jealous People.\" Since this is a very difficult story to track down I'll have to tell you the plot. Earth is under attack by aliens. We learn that God is on their side. So we get mad and go after God and the aliens planning to destroy both, because we are a jealous people.\n\nThis movie seems to suggest that the only good alien is a dead alien. Are there no wise, gentle aliens inhabiting the stars that want to be friends? We're to assume that Shaw is making the same stupid mistake about meeting the Engineers as Rafe Spall makes when he treats the alien snake as cute? Prometheus, Alien, Aliens, and all the rest tell us over and over again aliens from space are dangerous. Of course, these are horror movies, and like the template for most horror movies, all the victims are stupid and all the bad guys are evil. I hate this message in science fiction movies and books. Why wasn't Prometheus different and had the Engineers be noble? Prometheus is a very cynical film.\n\nPrometheus also sends another offensive message. Prometheus is a science fictional version of intelligent design. Why can't people accept that life on Earth is an accident of evolution? This Chariot of the Gods approach has the same problem as theology. If God created us, who created God? If the Engineers created us, who created the Engineers? Why do we need an initial cause for our existence? Prometheus is anti-science.\n\nShaw and Holloway want to know why humans are on Earth. They are the driving characters of the story, yet their characterizations are extremely weak. This is the first flaw of the movie. By having a couple, the writers diluted the characterization of each. Shaw eventually becomes the main character of the movie, but we don't know that until the last fourth of the movie, and she never gelled as a personality. Prometheus would have been far more gripping if Charlie hadn't existed, and Shaw's obsession was the main focus of the story.\n\nThe movie further dilutes the creation of strong characterization with the subplot of Peter Weyland, who wants to find the Engineers hoping they will bestow life extension on him. If this was revealed at the beginning of the mission, it would have created two strong opposing wills, and that might have worked, but leaving Weyland hidden on the ship till near the end as a \"surprise\" hurt the story badly. The character has no purpose and is killed off rather quickly. Meredith Vickers who seems to run things but isn't the captain, and who might be Weyland's daughter, is another pointless character.\n\nGreat science fiction needs great characters with a clear goals or desires. Think about Gattaca, we have Vincent a normal human living in a world of genetically enhanced humans. Vincent wants to go into space, so how can he possibly have the right stuff when the real astronauts have been genetically engineered? Prometheus doesn't have strong characters because it had too many characters \u2013 nobody stood out, nobody's goals drives the story. Shaw's goal is rather unappealing \u2013 wanting to meet The Engineers to ask them why they visited the Earth. But isn't that questioned answered when she discovers they brought DNA to Earth? Are The Engineers the Johnny Appleseeds of life in the galaxy?\n\nWhy does Shaw wear a crucifix without stating her Christianity? Isn't this Chariot of the Gods plot in direct conflict with Christianity just as much as Darwin's evolution?\n\nI can buy The Engineers seeding the planets, but there's no reason given why or if the Engineers visited ancient civilizations. Why do these civilizations leave records of star patterns in the sky? Did the Engineers come by to visit? Did they help develop these civilizations? And did they tell the people where in the sky they came from? Why? So we could come visit some day? Then why is the location a biological weapon repository? Why would you tell people it's location? That doesn't make any sense. In all first contact stories both humans and aliens are leery of revealing their home world. If the Engineers repeatedly left maps of where to find them, where would they point to? And why? Again, my theory that good Engineers were warning everyone about bad Engineers.\n\nYou'd think the Engineers would think like Match.com users and plan to meet in a neutral and safe location. We could also assume, a la Arthur C. Clarke, that the invitation is test of our readiness to be space travelers ourselves. It's a sign we've evolved. The film eventually tells us the Engineers didn't like how we turned out and planned to exterminate us with a black goo that generates the scary aliens of Alien\/Aliens. Are these the bad Engineers going around undoing what the good Engineers have done?\n\nThe Engineers look like us. It's implied we are their children. So why destroy us with H. R. Giger aliens? Are the monster aliens superior to us? Are they meant to stimulate our development with adversity? Are they some kind of punishment? What did we do?\n\nPeter Weyland has a much more powerful need to meet the Engineers, he wants to keep living. I would claim seeking out aliens for advanced technology to be a greater driving force than religion and ontology, but it's never really developed. In fact, the idea is developed so late in the film, and nipped in the bud so quickly, that I think it's just filler.\n\nMy movie companions did not like how Prometheus tried to mix in religion with aliens. Neither of the two women I went to the show with are religious, and they just thought a cross wearing space woman was unreal. Why mix Christianity with von D\u00e4niken mumbo jumbo?\n\nClue #5. In the end, we movie goers get one thing out of the movie, we know where the H. R. Giger aliens come from and why. They are a biological weapon of The Engineers. We assumed they created them, but I supposed they could have found them on a planet and just used them. Either way, we have answers for past Alien movies in the franchise.\n\nFrankenstein; or, A Modern Prometheus\n\nA reader recommended I read \"Is Prometheus anti-science? Screenwriter Damon Lindelof responds.\" The interview gives me further clues about Prometheus. I had forgotten the full title of Mary Shelley's classic, Frankenstein; or, A Modern Prometheus. Lindelof talks about the film as \"Frankenstein 101.\" This works on several levels. It emphasizes that Prometheus is also a horror film, that it's about science and religion, and it's about monsters. From this analogy I have to ask: Who is the monster in Prometheus, and who is Frankenstein?\n\nThe obvious answer is The Engineers are Frankenstein and the monster are the H. R. Giger aliens, who appear to be created to thrive on humans. But if we're to believe they were created to destroy us, does that make us the monster too? And what about David, is he a monster, and we're his Frankenstein? And who is the Frankenstein that created The Engineers?\n\nThese are great literary allusions, but this doesn't sidestep that the Frankenstein theme is also a form of intelligent design philosophy. I thought the movie was weakened by too many characters, but I think it's also weakened by too many monsters and Frankensteins. That could have been solved by not having The Engineers seed Earth with DNA, and then the ancient human star maps would have been warnings.\n\nHowever, in the end, even though I give Prometheus an overall B, I do give it an A+ for ambition.\n\nAre all superheroes as durable and immortal as Wile E. Coyote? My wife and I went to see The Avengers the other day. Normally we don't go to movies about comic book characters, but The Avengers was getting such great reviews we thought we'd give it a try. I went through a brief comic book reading phase in 1963, and I've seen the first Christopher Reeves Superman and the first Michael Keaton Batman, and that's about it for my comic book experience. As a child I loved the George Reeves Adventures of Superman TV show and the Mighty Mouse cartoons. One of my first blogs was about memories of all us neighborhood kids wanting to fly, \"Super Men and Mighty Mice.\"\n\nI am a lifelong science fiction fan and computer geek, so I've been around a lot of people who love comics. By all accounts, I should love comics too, but for some reason I don't. I've read books and watched documentaries about the history of comics and their fans, so I'm not completely ignorant of the genre. But watching The Avengers was probably what it would be like for me to attend the opera, I was way out of my element. It made me want to ask a lot of questions.\n\nThis isn't a review of The Avengers. I'm quite confident it's a great movie for its intended audience. I'm not the intended audience, and it left me wondering about many things, and I obviously don't have the right mindset. Maybe if I knew how the game was played I could have enjoyed the movie more.\n\nWhy people love comic books and superhero movies totally baffles me. Now I don't want to be a Grinch about comics, or be a old man fuddy-duddy pooh-pooh other people's fun, but I do have some questions about comic books and superheroes.\n\nMy first question is: Are you expected to check your mind in at the theater door when going to see a superhero movie? Is the fun of such a show returning to the state of mind you had before starting 1st grade? Is part of the thrill forgetting all logic and science? Is the fun of watching The Avengers pretending to be five years old again?\n\nMany people call superhero movies science fiction, but I really hate that because it suggests that science fiction can be completely ignorant about science. I'd go so far as to say that superhero movies are anti-science by ignoring the laws of physics and coming up with really insane concepts and suggesting they are science based. For instance, in The Avengers the whole story is built around a power source called a tesseract. A tesseract is a geometrical concept, a 4D cube. The film also has a flying aircraft carrier, space aliens, Norse gods, mutated humans and flying metal suits with no apparent fuel supply. Plus characters can pound on each other like Warner Brother cartoon characters and behave like the Three Stooges and no one ever gets hurts, much less bruised and bleeding.\n\nI have to ask: Do superhero movies exist in a reality similar to the reality where Bugs Bunny and Moe, Larry and Curly exist? That's okay if that's how to play the game, but to me fictional realities with no rules ruins the fun of make-believe.\n\nAnd, why are superheroes like Greek and Roman gods? They have all kinds of powers, they fly, they are petty and egotistical, and they fight with each other. Also, we're asked to believe that the fate of humanity depends on these beings saving us time and again. Doesn't that seem like some kind of transference from religion? Are fans of superheroes worshippers?\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not saying people shouldn't watch superhero movies. These movies are loved by millions, and the movie industry makes huge profits, a big US export, so they are great for the economy. All I'm asking is if other people don't question the fictional reality of the comic book superhero world. I love science fiction, and even some fantasy, but the world of superheroes seems way out there, way beyond any possible believability. Or is that their appeal? Are comic books a genre about an alternate reality with no scientific laws and magic works?\n\nI mean, we're talking the age of myths. It's like reverting our minds back to a Paleolithic mindset. Talk about your old time religion, this kind of magical thinking would put us back in the time of Genesis and Exodus, when the world was full of powerful beings, magic and great catastrophes. Why are superhero movies so appealing? Do people actual crave a time when the laws of physics were totally unknown and seeing is believing? Of course this state of mind was how the whole world existed before science. Maybe comics should be called pre-science fiction.\n\nWatching The Avengers, it bothered me that normal humans were like ants scurrying around waiting for the superheroes to save them. You could call superhero movies salvation films, because their plots often reflect evil wanting to destroy mankind and superheroes saving us. Of course, we could just let Joseph Campbell explain the whole hero with a thousand faces again.\n\nI grew up on the science fiction of Robert A. Heinlein, and he liked to believe that humans were the most dangerous critters in the universe. He thought normal people could take on all challengers in the galaxy, and only ordinary human heroes were needed. I thought Heinlein was overly aggressive in wanting to kick alien ass, but I do like his idea that we should live and die by our own abilities. I don't want to babysat by gods, mutants and aliens.\n\nWatching The Avengers made me wonder if superhero movies are like porn movies, but instead of making you want sex, they make you lust for power. That each of the Avengers represents powerful abilities movie goers would love to have themselves. But if you really think about the Avengers, do you really envy them? Who would want to be The Hulk? Or Thor? I bet most people envy the billionaire playboy, but does being a super-asshole have to come with the power suit? Captain America seems like a nice guy, but that outfit! Really? How important are those awful clothes? Can Superman fly just in jeans and a t-shirt? I wouldn't mind being able to fly like that if I didn't have to wear a leotard and cape. And Batman looks like a pimped out S&M freak.\n\nWhat kind of inner fantasies do superheroes appeal to? Has anybody asked their therapist?\n\nMovie fans flocked to The Avengers and loved it. I'm just curious as to why. Asking me to believe in flying aircraft carriers is insulting to me. I guess my imagination has limits. I can accept angels and monotheistic robots in Battlestar Galactica, but I can't accept flying aircraft carriers. Why. Did it do anything up in the air that it couldn't do floating on the ocean? Where was it going, and where did it come from? As far as we knew it was just flying around in a holding pattern. How was a flying aircraft carrier important to the plot?\n\nAlso, why are all the superheroes equal in durability. Shouldn't their be some kind of hierarchy of power? Shouldn't their be a chain of command? They should be like rock, paper, scissors. Thor can hammer Loki, Loki can outwit The Hulk, The Hulk can forge Iron Man, Iron Man will bend Captain America, Captain America can romance Black Widow, and Black Widow can seduce Thor. Why do they squabble and punch each other like Moe, Larry and Curly? In the movie our heroes spent more time fighting each other than the enemy. My wife barely liked the movie, and thought it was okay as a comedy.\n\nI was bored. I'm 60, so I've seen a lot of movies with explosions and cities blowing up. I didn't see anything new in special effects, or any new action sequences that I didn't see in 1996 watching Independence Day. In terms of creating an alternative reality, The Matrix (1999) had just as much comic book action as The Avengers, and it was believable within its own context. Of course, that leads me to ask: Am I suppose to assume all superhero movies exist in the same alternate reality and it's an assumption I should come to the theater believing, or do each of them create a new reality to explore?\n\nI'm used to science fiction where every story invents a new reality for the reader to judge. So I'm asking: Are superhero stories all set in a shared comic book reality. Or is it two realities, Marvel and DC? Dune isn't the world of Foundation, and Foundation is not the world of Blade Runner, or Starship Troopers. To me it seems like superhero reality is one shared by all comic book writers and it would believable that Superman could fly along side Ironman.\n\nLike I said, I really don't mean to pick on superhero movies. I love westerns and old movies from the 1930s, and most of my friends don't. So I can understand my taste for comic book movies is just not suited for the genre. My not liking comic book movies is no different from me not getting into opera or basketball. It's not a criticism. I just wondered into the wrong movie theater and went WTF?"}

When some friends wanted to watch it, they explained the plot to me. I thought it sounded so incredibly lame. How interesting does a movie about a bunch of homeless teenage cowboys finding and raising a child sound? I was forced to watch it against my will, but I didn't think it was that awful, in fact I found it rather entertaining. Parts of it are ridiculous. The girl at points can be annoying, especially when her brother is dying and she's hitting on the guy who shot him. However despite it's many drawbacks I did manage to enjoy it.\n\nI definitely wouldn't recommend this movie to a guy who can't stand to watch chick flicks, but to guys who can tolerate them, the movie isn't completely insufferable. For a woman who likes sap movies, like the ones who made me watch this movie, this is a must see.\n\nWhen explaining the movie it sounds like it's about a bunch of gay cowboy's raising a child, I was surprised.\n\n6 of 7 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?"}

{"text":"Review: 'Seeking A Friend At The End Of The World' Is A Sweet Pre-Apocalyptic Journey\n\nWhile there are some elements of predictability in Seeking a Friend at the End of the World, the details and sentiment shines through beautifully. There was a certain grace about the film, not in the somewhat forced love story, but the general compassion to each and every character, no matter what little screen time they have. The result is a pleasant and sentimental movie that doesn't feel gimmicky.\n\nThe film takes place about three weeks before a giant astroid is set to collide with Earth, killing everything and everyone. To the credit of writer\/director Lorene Scafaria, the typical pre-apocalyptic fanfare isn't just sex, drugs and drinking (although there are some great moments of that). It was sincere in the way that some people just continue on with their lives to the very end; lawns are still mowed and checks are still paid. It was these little moments that were the heart of the film, holding up what otherwise would be one of those manic pixie dream girl opening the closed off guy genres.\n\nSure, that may turn you guys off a bit. I get it. But tonally the film hits in the same ballpark as Stranger than Fiction and (500) Days of Summer. Even though there are moments you see coming, and plenty of borderline corny changes of events, you still find yourself emotionally invested in the journey. It's comforting and never panders to the audience. It's most certainly demonstrative, which is welcome in the general forced schlock of the genre\n\nLike Stranger Than Fiction's more serious Will Ferrell, Steve Carell pulls off the blank stare of existential crisis well, but it's Kiera Knightely that impressed me the most. Her character of Penny definitely hits the aforementioned manic pixie trope, but she walks the fine line of annoying and charming very, very well.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say that this is the movie is THE movie to see before the end of the world, it's still something that's worth a shot if you're in the sweet but not cheesy mood.\n\nSumOlogy: Additionally, Connie Britton's performance alone is enough to see this movie.\n\nSide note for the parents and such: This is a very soft R. The subject material is naturally dark, but in no way did I see this is rated so strictly. I'd say 14+ is safe."}
{"text":"My Thoughts on The Movie \"taxi Driver\"\n\nIt's been a while since I saw this flick but here's my most notable impressions.\n\nIn the movie \"Taxi Driver\", Robert DeNiro played a man named Travis who spends most of his time driving people around in his cab. Perhaps the two most impressive technical effects in the movie are the music and the scenes where Travis cruises the street. One other notable aspect of the movie is Travis' narration.\n\nThe movie begins with scenes of the streets in a big, fast-paced city. These scenes were accompanied by jazz music. The music was smooth and set the tone for the kind of night life of a big city. The audience saw the streets of the city many times through Travis' eyes as he drove along in his taxi cab. Travis, at one point speaks of what he calls the scum of the streets. The audience views the very streets which Travis speaks of.\n\nThere are times when one gets the feeling that this movie is like a detective story. A few times Travis is shown writing down his thoughts but at the same time the audience can hear what he's writing. At such times, the fact that everything is documented, makes it seem as though there is some sort of authority to the narration. The narrative therefore hints at the possibility of a kind of good against evil theme. This is what actually does happen at the end of the movie as Travis goes up against the pimps."}

{"text":"After Directed by Roman Polanski and starring Kate Winslet, Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz. As a director, Roman Polanski has always had a genius for finding the divide between civility and blunt self-interest, and then merrily Evel Knieveling over it. (John Huston's line in Chinatown about people being capable of anything at any given time says it all, really.) Carnage, Polanski's follow-up to the genially wicked Ghost Writer, can't entirely transcend its stage-bound origins (Yasmina Reza's Tony-winning God of Carnage), but it works as a fantastically nasty showcase for some immensely talented performers to get down with their bad selves. Think a mixed-doubles tennis match, with cherry bombs. Kicking off with a deceptively placid shot of kids at play, Reza and Polanski's screenplay follows the thermonuclear differences of opinion that occur when an upper-crust New York pair (Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly) invite another couple (Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz) into their apartment in an attempt to resolve a scuffle between their children. Verbal dustups of all shapes and sizes quickly follow. For all of Reza's celebrated dark wit and way with a punch line (the running gag involving a hamster just kills), there's a rather flowcharty feel to her scenario here, with the various escalations and shifts in allegiance between the four coming at fairly predictable intervals. Thankfully, Polanski keeps things moving at an expert clip, mainly by taking his cast's most distinguishable characteristics (Reilly's cuddly everyman quality, Winslet's repressed earthiness) and cinching them all a few notches too tight, particularly in the case of Foster, who delivers a merciless lampooning of her own intelligence. (The most outwardly reprehensible of the lot, Waltz's Blackberry-obsessed lawyer, somehow comes off the best, simply by being self-aware.) First-daters may want to stay far, far away, but in Polanski's hands, Carnage delivers a brisk, blackly hilarious 79 minutes in the presence of some wonderfully bad company. --Andrew Wright"}
{"text":"Movie Review: Paul Greengrass's United 93: Guts\n\nUnited 93 recreates the flight of the fourth plane on September 11, 2001, the one on which the passengers got word by cell phone of the attacks on the World Trade Center, figured out the hijackers were on a suicide mission, and attempted to retake control of the plane. The movie was clearly made to dramatize our fascination with the fate of the unsuspecting people on the plane, those resourceful anybodies whose actions, in this version, saved the U.S. Capitol\u2014What would we have done in their place? Would we have had their nerve?\n\nThe English writer-director Paul Greengrass allows for this projection, but doesn't hype it. He divides the story into three movements: the air traffic controllers figuring out that something is up, though they don't know what; the jihadists' attack; and the passengers' and crew's counterattack. We always feel we're present because Greengrass and his cinematographer Barry Ackroyd shoot everything with handheld cameras, but at the same time this makes every situation feel roughly equivalent. The camerawork functions like an even coat of opaque paint.\n\nThe terrorists aren't fully characterized, but neither is anyone else. (The pilots and stewardesses are played by actual pilots and stewardesses, and among the actors playing passengers I recognized a few names but no faces.) Even the famous line with which the passengers launched their offensive\u2014\"Let's roll!\"\u2014isn't isolated and framed in the usual movieish way. Our immersion in the situation is total, which also means our perspective is less limited but also less intense than it would have been if we had actually been on board.\n\nOf course we know from the start who the terrorists are and what they're up to, and so they affect us in a more conventionally suspenseful way. (When they delay making their move on the plane, you may find yourself idiotically hoping that they won't.) Even when the terrorists and passengers appear in the same shot, waiting for the flight to be called, for instance, the terrorists seem to be in a different, more focused movie, while the passengers chat on their cell phones or peck at their laptops.\n\nThe scenes set among the air traffic controllers are altogether more interesting. The controllers are tool-edge sharp, picking up and deciphering the slightest hints over their headsets, and they're effective to the extent possible against a sneak attack. (The only snafu is the military response, but in the case of flight 93 what could the air force have accomplished that the passengers and crew didn't\u2014downing the plane on uninhabited ground.) But it's a relief that Greengrass avoids turning the controllers' alertness into romance by focusing on heroes battling against the forces of evil and incomprehension. It's nice for a change that a major event is not being processed into the same old crud that our moviemakers have always passed off as historical filmmaking."}
{"text":"Film: Who's the Designer?\n\nImagine a futuristic place where all sexism, racism, and homophobia have been wiped out. Instead, everybody with a real job is a test-tube baby designed by a geneticist to have the perfect collection of Mommy and Daddy's genes. But the \"love children\" who are conceived the old-fashioned way are declared invalid and only serve menial functions in society. Instead of resum\u00e9s, job seekers give blood samples, and potential husbands and wives exchange hair specimens.\n\nThat's the dystopia of the movie Gattaca. This marriage of Orwell, Huxley, and Hitchcock plays off recent headlines about cloned sheep, The Bell Curve, and the Human Genome Project. Vincent (Ethan Hawke), our invalid hero, born without benefit of genetic engineering, enters the space program by beating the system. He finds a genetic wunderkind (Jude Law) who has been paralyzed in an accident. In exchange for room and board, he borrows Mr. Perfect DNA's identity and tissue samples. He leaves his job as a janitor and moves up to the big leagues.\n\nVincent lives his life in constant fear that someone will discover he is a \"God-child.\" Every day he scrubs himself down to rid himself of excess dead cells that could give him away and collects specimens from his partner to use for identification.\n\nThe message of this movie is that genetics can give a probability of a person's potential, but that there are no certainties. Furthermore, contrary to certain strains of contemporary thought, identity is not solely determined by genetics. And attempts to shape humanity by means of designer genes are formulas for disaster.\n\nInvalid Vincent envies his valid brother's favored position and eventually outperforms him. He succeeds through his training program on his own merits, though he wouldn't have even been accepted because of his genetic makeup. Vincent is a star student and becomes eligible to fulfill his dream of flying in space.\n\nEverything is going fine until the mission director winds up dead. The cops vacuum the building for every leftover human cell and discover one of Vincent's real eyebrow hairs near the crime scene. The dead supervisor wanted to cancel the mission, thus increasing the suspicion. Enter Uma Thurman as the love interest and two detectives (Alan Arkin and Loren Dean) looking for the killer. (Gore Vidal, the leftwing novelist, has a supporting role as Vincent's boss.)\n\nThis relatively nonviolent movie owes more to black-and-white film noir than to most of today's Sci-Fi conventions. There's little gadgetry or special effects floating around. Instead, Gattaca focuses on plot over action. Regrettably, the movie drags, and important scenes build little suspense and look forced. Faster pacing would have added some much-needed excitement. Neither Hawke nor Thurman gives any passion to the performance; they wind up as sterile as the alcohol prep pads used before a DNA test.\n\nGattaca beats its genetic identity theme to death. When Vincent is ready to go up in space, his crippled cohort gives a farewell present: a lifetime supply of urine and blood samples. The name \"Gattaca\" derives from the alphabetical protein sequence of human DNA. The movie, to its credit, shows there is more to life than biochemical determinism can admit, though it isn't quite sure what that is."}
{"text":"\"What was the inspiration for brilliantlove?\" Ponders director Ashley Horner, when asked that very question by this interviewer. \"\u2026the British are notoriously crap at erotica, the French are good at it, the Germans are good at it\u2026 The Brits are perceived by the outside world as being either really kinky, or really repressed. And I wanted to make a film that captures the first few months of a love affair, where it's absolutely mentally gorgeous.\"\n\nThe topic of conversation, Horner's latest film, brilliantlove, which debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York earlier this year, had its European premiere at the EIFF in June. Written by Horner and screenwriter Sean Conway, from Conway's short screenplay, Erotology, the film is set in a Northern English town, and follows an artist named Manchester (Liam Browne) and a taxidermist called Noon (Nancy Trotter Landry) as they document their passionate affair through explicit photographs over the course of a long hot summer. But when Manchester's work is discovered and the couple are suddenly thrown into the excess of a heartless art world that threatens both their artistic talents and their relationship.\n\nMade over a two and a half year period, from inspiration to filming, brilliantlove's premise of young love, uninhibited sex and allusions to the study of erotology, split the reviewers at Tribeca, with some critics praising its poetic language and youthful idealism, and others criticising its distinct lack of realism.\n\nI think for some people it was a really uncomfortable experience. \u2026and for some members of the audience, it works fantastically\u2026\n\nCriticism that Horner is well aware of, \"\u2026some people say it's a very idealised world they live in, how do they clean themselves, how do they keep the room warm, where's the water coming from? Those questions are just not important.\" Horner adds, \"I think for some people it was a really uncomfortable experience.\" He pauses, \"And that's not to say that they're prudes or anything like that, but this film experiments with that feeling of what it is to sit in a building full of people you don't know, and watch highly charged erotic imagery. And I think that's interesting\u2026and for some members of the audience, it works fantastically\u2026\"\n\n\u2026it questioned the nature of what makes something art, and what makes something pornography, which is one of the theoretical, intellectual things in the film\u2026.\n\nWhile the film features numerous sex scenes, which have attracted most of the movie's press and criticism, Horner is quick to point out that these scenes were filmed \"\u2026 not to be exploitative in any way\u2026no one's done it [before]\u2026 it questioned the nature of what makes something art, and what makes something pornography, which is one of the theoretical, intellectual things in the film\u2026.\"\n\nThe question of the plentiful sex scenes that make up brilliantlove, yields some interesting answers, as Horner reveals that the film was a \"voyage of discovery\" as neither he, Trotter Landry or Browne had filmed a sex scene before. But Trotter Landry is philosophical about the extreme nature of her film debut, simply saying, \"I suppose if you haven't done something before, you just set your bar to wherever\u2026\"\n\nCarefully rehearsed over two weeks, Browne states that all three of them had, \"\u2026just talked about the characters and their background, and what motivates them, just trying to get our heads round it as much as possible, to make it easier once we were filming.\" Trotter Landry agrees saying, \"When we were rehearsing before the shoot, we had a fair amount of input and discussion about how the characters could be embodied, and Ash gave us a lot of time developing that and we had a chance to improvise, although largely the characters were there.\"\n\nBut while the film has shocked audiences with its sex scenes, the real source of surprise for those involved with the film was its language, as Trotter Landry states, \"The script was quite jaw dropping, wasn't it, when we first\u2026.we thought the same thing, I mean, how the hell are we going to do this?\" Horner agrees, \"The language was very explicit. When you're writing the script, that's all well and good, but the sheer practicality of this, there were things that we just couldn't film.\"\n\nSo with all the hype surrounding brilliantlove, who should see it and why? \"I think,\" begins Horner, \"that it's certainly a late night movie to see with somebody you love, or somebody you want to love. I think it's going to work really well at home on the big screen, on the big telly, because it's a date movie really, just a very explicit date movie. I was asked by Time Out in New York what I wanted people to feel when they left the cinema, and I said wanted them to discuss the finer points of the European Cinema, and then go home and have really great sex.\"\n\nSparking debate and igniting passions seems to be the message of brilliantlove, hailed as \"brave\" by Horner, Trotter Landry and Browne, this film is challenging and erotic, and the infamous scenes of a sexual nature, are really norm amongst people in love, as Browne states, \"The thing about the sex scenes, is that they all seemed so natural, it's what young people get up to, and if people think that's unrealistic, then they must just have shit sex.\""}

Some viewers may have mayhem on their minds, as well, after sitting through this long, draggy film wearing 3-D glasses for no special reason.\n\nThis is all the more dispiriting because Immortals was directed by Tarsem (aka Tarsem Singh), who built his reputation as a visualist based on innovative music videos, commercials (remember the \"We Will Rock You\" spot for Pepsi?) and the almost insanely ambitious feature The Fall. Because of a second-rate script,\n\nHollywood has given a black eye to the romantic comedy; romantic dramas are scarce. All the more reason to cheer Drake Doremus' fresh, vibrant film Like Crazy, which is anything but a conventional genre piece.

In fact, it isn't the story that makes Puss in Boots stand out, but the imaginative staging, especially in 3-D.\n\nThere are great moments in Anonymous, from its arresting opening scene (with Derek Jacobi rushing into a Broadway theater and striding directly onstage) to recreations of the first performances ever given of Henry V and Hamlet before a spellbound throng of groundlings. I, too, was captivated during those thrilling scenes, which is why it's so frustrating that Anonymous nearly drowns itself in a sea of confusion.\n\nBecause no one wants to tell a story in chronological order any more, this saga hopscotches back and forth through three separate time periods (not counting the modern-day framing device with Jacobi). I know this because we see David Thewlis as Queen Elizabeth's advisor William Cecil in three different makeups: as a middle-aged man, then older, then elderly. It's easy to keep track of the Queen because she's played in the two later stages of life by the magnificent\u2014\n\nThe archeologists who extracted artifacts from King Tut's Tomb couldn't have been any more excited than the movie lovers who witnessed the rebirth of Ernst Lubitsch's The Loves of Pharaoh Tuesday night at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, on the exact date of the movie palace's 89th anniversary. Piecing this 1922 silent film epic back together has been a formidable project for German film preservationist Thomas Bakels of Alpha-Omega, who told me it was even more difficult than restoring Metropolis! It took five years to complete the digital reconstruction and clean-up, even after the Munich Filmmuseum had gone through the laborious process of combining elements of prints from around the globe.\n\nAll I can say is, it was worth the wait. Incomplete prints have existed for years, with key differences depending on where it was first released: the American version had a happy ending, the Italian interpretation focused on the love story while the Russian release all but eliminated it. I think it's fair to say that it wasn't possible to fully appreciate the movie's imposing beauty, scope or dramatic impact until now.

{"text":"The Edge (Blu-ray)\n\nPublisher:\n\n\"Because today\u2026 I'm gonna kill the motherfucker!\" In that sentence, the \"I\" is Anthony Hopkins, and the \"motherfucker\" is a Kodiak bear. The movie is 1997's The Edge, a peculiar survivalist adventure with a script by David Mamet. Hearing words like that come out of Hopkins, the most archly patrician of actors\u2014playing to type here as an introspective billionaire\u2014gives the line an extra punch, because the journey there is much longer for him than most. And it's a credit to Mamet, a writer forever concerned with the world of men and their animal natures, that he could deliver an actor like Hopkins to the point where he loses his aristocratic air and becomes the swarthiest of heroes, ready to do battle with a motherfucking bear. Let that be a warning: If any raccoons dare get within the vicinity of Howards End, they should know what's coming to them.\n\nIt's a shame The Edge wasn't also directed by Mamet, whose economic style might have cut the fat from a film that behaves too much like a conventional Hollywood thriller. Those duties were handed over to New Zealand director Lee Tamahori, who must have seemed like a natural choice based on his 1994 breakthrough Once Were Warriors, a forceful tale of masculinity and violence among Maori. But Tamahori's workmanlike production doesn't match the elemental power of Mamet's script, and it fails to evoke the harsh physical conditions that turn ordinary, civilized men into resourceful survivalists and predators.\n\nNevertheless, Hopkins does fine work as a billionaire stranded in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness with a smarmy photographer, played by Alec Baldwin. The early scenes establish a seething rivalry between the two men over Hopkins' statuesque wife (Elle Macpherson)\u2014to the point where Hopkins asks Baldwin \"How are you going to kill me?\" before their plane goes down\u2014but it's put on hold as they rely on each other to make it out of the woods alive. As it happens, the book-smart Hopkins has accumulated a lot of knowledge about living in the wild, but his cunning is tested when he and Baldwin face off against a relentless, bloodthirsty bear. (He's played by \"Bart The Bear,\" in perhaps the greatest of his many star turns, including appearances in The Bear, On Deadly Ground, and The Great Outdoors.)\n\nBeyond a stock of punchy Mametisms\u2014Baldwin: \"A month ago, old Smokey here would've reared up, you probably would've called your lawyer.\" Hopkins: \"Nah, I wouldn't do that to an animal.\"\u2014The Edge remains gripping mostly because of Hopkins, who suggests a blueblood secretly excited to be in mortal peril. In the woods, he's no longer a billionaire with the resources to do anything he likes, but simply a human being relying solely on his wits and instinct. Tamahori doesn't have the chops to give his transformation the Straw Dogs treatment it deserves, but The Edge is an interesting footnote in the Mamet canon, manifesting in brute force what he generally expresses in words."}

The performances of the lead actors are solid and the football action is well-staged and compelling.\n\nBut as we all know after watching \"We Are Marshall,\" Hollywood takes dramatic license when it comes to these types of movies.\n\nOne pivotal scene involves a Syracuse game against West Virginia University in Morgantown, where a bunch of racist hillbillies go wild because a black man has the audacity to help a team beat their beloved Mountaineers. It's an understatement to say West Virginians aren't portrayed in a very positive light. In fact, things get so bad that Coach Schwartzwalder, who was a former WVU football star, worries a riot's going to break. Trash and racist slurs come flying out of the stands at a rapid pace.\n\nThere's only one problem.\n\nIt never happened.\n\nThe game supposedly played in Morgantown was actually contested at Syracuse. The racist West Virginia crowd is a Hollywood invention.\n\nI'm not saying Davis didn't encounter racism. Of course he did. But he didn't on that day in Morgantown. Mainly because he wasn't even in Morgantown on that day. If it was a small thing I would let it slide, after all this isn't a documentary. But it's a major part of the story. It's a pivotal moment. It's designed to make you feel a certain way as you watch what unfolds and it sets up the movie's finale.\n\nBut it is also a lie, plain and simple.\n\nThe people who were on the Syracuse and West Virginia teams in 1959 and again in 1960 when the Orangeman really did play in Morgantown say nothing like what's portrayed in the movie took place.\n\nBut the lying doesn't stop there.\n\nThe movie also takes a shot at Schwartzwalder. He wasn't just a WVU grad, he was also a West Virginia native from Point Pleasant.\n\nPeople who knew him and who played for him say Schwartzwalder was no racist. But you won't get that fact from this movie. Unfortunately, Schwartzwalder is no longer around to defend himself. The Hall of Fame coach died in 1993.\n\nDespite its many positive qualities I can't recommend \"The Express.\" For me, when a film presenting itself as being based on fact uses despicable fiction to tell its story, that's a deal breaker.\n\nNo thanks. Reality can be ugly enough without writers, producers and directors reinventing history.\n\nOn my rating scale, \"The Express\" Strikes Out. This is not a reflection on Ernie Davis the man or the player. It's a call about a very poorly made film."}
{"text":"When they share the screen together, it seems as though they were truly made for each other.\n\nThe two of them hit it off pretty quickly and then they are inseparable. Anna decides to over-stay her student visa because she can't stand to be away from Jacob for the summer. This proves costly because when she tries to go back to America, her visa has been blocked due to her infraction. Now, Jacob and Anna must deal with long distance and time to keep their love kindling.\n\nLike Crazy doesn't spend enough time convincing us that the romance rings true. There's a short five-minute segment that is supposed to capture their passionate young love, but it isn't enough to make us care about the outcome. If anything it's thanks to the chemistry between Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin that keeps the movie together. When they share the screen together, it seems as though they were truly made for each other.\n\nOf course this distance and time are going to be tough for the pair.\n\nIf this love was as special as Like Crazy would like us to believe then he would probably move.\n\nThe starting and stopping again as Anna puts it, wears both of them out. They decide to keep in touch, but to start seeing other people. The problem comes that Anna can't breathe when she thinks of the magical times the two of them have shared. She's afraid she'll never have those feelings for anyone again. Jacob makes things more difficult than they need to be. He has started his own studio in LA and refuses to move out to Europe to be with Anna. If this love was as special as Like Crazy would like us to believe then he would probably move.\n\nLike Crazy is more concerned with the difficulty of long-distance romance. The couple tries multiple attempts to circumvent the restrictions of the Visa, but are blocked at every pass. There are points where it seems that there is no more wood for the fire. Jacob has a love affair with one of his assistants (Jennifer Lawrence). Lawrence is extremely underused considering her talent, but then again the film isn't really about her. She has trouble penetrating the wall Jacob has put around his heart because the hope of reconciliation with Anna lingers at every moment.\n\nBeing the critical darling at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, Like Crazy had a lot to live up to. While it may not succeed entirely as a great film, the techniques used in the film are an ode to this generations indie filmmakers. Two different scenes in the movie use time-lapse photography and the film was mostly shot using HDSLR's. Director Drake Doremus shot his 250,000$ film with a 1,500$ camera. Of course then lenses he used were far more expensive, but the fact that he used a Canon 7D to shoot Like Crazy remains.\n\nCan romance survive time and long-distance? Like Crazy aims to answer these questions and it may not be the happy ending everyone was hoping for. What we're left with is a well-acted film, featuring a breakthrough performance from Felicity Jones and the dreams of Indie filmmakers every where being ignited. It's incredible what little was used to make Like Crazy the film it is. It's just unfortunate that the setup was lacking and the commitment of the pair consistently comes into discussion even when it would've been possible for them to live happily together8 Comments\n\nThe main problem I had with \"Like Crazy\" was, as you also seem to point out, the believability of the struggle. I think the problem of distance due to a Visa restriction, though modern and contemporary, feels a bit too small to really get me to care enough about whether or not they are willing to compromise and continue their love affair.\n\nDespite that, I felt the film did a very good job at showcasing a relationship that seemed genuine and real, stemming from the very personal camera work and the nuanced performances of the leads, especially from Felicity Jones, who was sadly overlooked during awards season.\n\nI think, all along, the story tells us, though very indirectly, that Jacob is a bit less \"in love\" than Anna, otherwise he would have just packed his bags and moved to England. I think that the director always remembers that these are two very young souls that despite being very much in love, can't seem to completely sacrifice for a higher cause and do away with their immaturity.\n\nI actually commented on that post when it went up saying I wanted to see Like Crazy. It took this long, but it finally happened. Felicity Jones was wonderful in this. My favorite scene was when she calls up Jacob and she can't breathe. It's a really well done look at a young woman completely in love. The film is a little rough around the edges, but I still enjoy it.\n\nI was somewhat disappointed by this movie myself. As you pointed out, the narrative doesn't spend nearly enough time to make us care about the central romance. The movie as a whole feels too much like a music video (maybe why the trailer is more moving than the film itself) and there was just too many contrivances to make it truly compelling.\n\nI read your review and I agreed with a lot of what you said. You came off really harsh though. Sure, Like Crazy had a lot to live up to and it doesn't quite reach that grade, but there are some highlights to take away. The aforementioned photography and acting by the two principle characters."}

A lot of latitude for interpretation here. An invitation to be self-indulgent! Here's what comes to mind first.\n\nMAGNOLIA (1999). It opens observing a few odd incidents, and then asks a probing question about why our lives follow the paths they do. Is there a pattern or meaning behind it all, or does stuff just happen randomly? Then we launch into a mosaic of interconnected characters, each of whom is struggling with his or her personal hell. What's it all about? I'm deeply touched by Anderson's contemplations.\n\nTHE RAPTURE (1991). This isn't exactly the Christian dogma, but it captures the spirit of the seeker. Mimi Rogers, playing a nihilist who comes to the end of her rope, reaches out for a new path of spirit and meaning. But what exactly does God want of her? She thinks she has the vision, but she can't be sure. And the consequences of going astray would be catastrophic. Rogers is brilliant here.\n\nI'm probably alone in saying this, but my personal favorite is A SERIOUS MAN (2009). Why is Larry Gopnik plagued? What does God want of him? Who can answer these questions? (Same question I just asked of THE RAPTURE\u2026yes, I'd say the question of what God wants; that's the key question in this life.) A SERIOUS MAN will be particularly on the wavelength of people interested in both Judaism and physics.\n\nHonorable mention to DONNIE DARKO (2001), which I regard as an accidental masterpiece, in that young Richard Kelly came out of nowhere and rapidly went right back to where he came from. It's a big mystery as to how he could have done anything this great. What's happening to the titular Donnie? What's happening to the world? The spiritual mystery here almost seems to make sense, and I'm intrigued."}
{"text":"John Sayles by Daniel Robert Epstein for SuicideGirls ( this unnamed Latin America country for at least two months. Some of them have been there even longer.\n\nSayles' always creates compelling and often difficult characters. This time Marcia Gay Harden is the standout as the Midwestern women Nan who will do anything including bribery and trampling over her countrywomen to get a baby.\n\nSayles is an enigma amongst his independent filmmaking peers. He doesn't make stylish films involving the death or dismemberment of its main characters ala Darren Aronofsky or Tarantinoesque crime dramas with dialogue that snaps easier than a gangster's neck. Instead he creates the personal dramas which many of us have experienced or know someone who has experienced them.\n\nSayles started out in the 1970's writing low budget horror films such as Piranha and Alligator for producer Roger Corman. He directed his first film Return of the Secaucus 7 in 1980 and since then he has created human dramas like Eight Men and City of Hope. In 1996 he was nominated for an Academy Award for screenwriting for his most celebrated film, Lone Star. Though that didn't seem to impact his career all that much. It is still difficult for him to raise the funds he needs. But writing and directing is what this man dies and he has no peer in that field.\n\nDaniel Robert Epstein: I don't think I will see a scene this year that was as powerful as the scene between the Irish woman [Susan Lynch] and the maid [Vanessa Martinez] in the hotel room where they each tell each other their heartbreaking mother stories. How do you direct something like that?\n\nJohn Sayles: What I usually do is give each character a biography of how their character got there and who their other relationships are with. That stuff is not always in the script. I also don't do rehearsals. Then you adjust things as you go. I told Susan that we wouldn't do many takes for this scene and that she would feel when gets character gets emotional and that's it. We only did three or four takes. A scene like that you don't want to intellectualize that much.\n\nWhen you have five or six actors in some of the other scenes, what I do is set parameters then maybe you adjust one actor at a time and see how it affects the dynamic of the group. Marcia Gay Harden's character is the most complex so a lot of my direction with her is to see how many different ways she can play it. I want to see them all. She just came up with incredible stuff without changing any lines but she's such volatile character who can be hot or cold. What was nice for the other characters is that they never knew what she would be from line to line so they were always on their tiptoes with her.\n\nDRE: Many of your movies, including this one straddle, that line between political and personal.\n\nJS: For me those two things are unavoidable. What was interesting about this movie is that we had this behind the scenes crew there in Acapulco. I told them that people have seen the kind of thing they've done before, so why don't they ask our North American actors and go out in the community and find out what they think of foreign adoptions. North Americans saw it as a very simple thing, there are these kids who need adopting, someone has to do it and that's a great thing which I agree with. Then the Mexican people were saying that these are kids who might never know their culture. One very cynical man even said that with money you can buy anything. Then there were people who thought that the countries that do it were a little shameful because they can't take of their kids. I agree with that as well. It's a very complex situation.\n\nKorean people don't come to the United States and adopt our children. People always smile at that and think that's a funny idea but it's not any funnier than Americans going to Korea and adopting their children. It's just this assumption that Americans have that they are doing everyone a big favor to become an American. It is a good deal to get adopted even by wacky parents if the alternative is ending up on the street. I think the political part is unavoidable, very often that's something the audience sees that the characters aren't aware of. The only characters who talk politically are the three old lefties who speculate on what happened to the left in their country.\n\nDRE: Marcia Gay Harden's character confronts the lawyer who is trying to go through the proper channels to get her a baby to adopt. Why did you choose to have that scene?\n\nJS:. There is this uncomfortable thing that finally no matter how well the agencies are run, some of them are run very well, you can't escape the fact that these people are getting to do this because they have the money. Very often the person who gave birth to the child gave the baby up because of economic reasons. Then when you add different cultures to it there is this whiff of cultural imperialism that can't be escaped. So you have this lawyer who is doing a pretty good job but he is not immune to pressure. He's got the government and these people on his back. He doesn't have a beautiful office and he's not getting rich from this. Very often they have to deal with corruption even if they are doing it legitimately. Some people think that if they bribe the cops they can bribe the adoption guys as well.\n\nIf you look at your tax form one of the things that it says is \u011bthat bribes paid to businesses in foreign countries cannot be taken off your taxes\u00ee. There is an assumption by the IRS that this is part of doing business in foreign countries. It is part of doing business in this country so there is an assumption that it is in any bureaucratic transaction.\n\nDRE: Many of your films involve characters that were anarchic and liberal when they were younger and as they grow older they move to the right without realizing it. Then they try to go back to left. How does that fit in with this film?\n\nJS: Once you have to be responsible for other people it changes your life. When you're just yourself and 20 your life can go in any direction and you can be freer with your decisions. You can make more radical decisions without them affecting anyone else. As you get older and if you choose to take on more responsibility of a family you can't just make the decision to move anytime anymore. You just can't live in the anarchic way. You can't just decide to be a Buddhist. Everything isn't possible anymore.\n\nThere are three movies that I made that are very specifically influenced by the age. Baby, It's You [released in 1983] is about kids in their teens who realize that they can't do anything in life. Something may turn out wrong and be permanent. Return of the Secaucus 7 is about people turning 30 and they're starting to realize that the world isn't going to turn out the way they wanted it too. They're going to have to live feeling like outsiders. Passion Fish [released in 1992] is about two women who are just forty. That is about some things that are just final; if you are paralyzed from the waist down you are going to stay that way. If you are a 40 year old actress and you are not Meryl Streep yet then you never will be.\n\nDRE: As an artist you have to be anarchic. How do you fit into that?\n\nJS: To a certain extent. I probably won't write a big epic movie for a while because the last two I wrote we haven't been able to finance. When I was 25 or 30 I might have said, hell I'll just write another and maybe 11 years from now I'll make it. I'm 53 now and 11 years from now I'll be 64. There's not that many 64 year old directors getting to make big movies. There's a little economic censorship. Until I get to make those other two epics I probably won't write another.\n\nDRE: What were those epics?\n\nJS: I wrote a movie called Sometime in the Sun which is set right after the Philippine insurrection around 1901. That was really America's first Vietnam. Teddy Roosevelt just felt that America should be an empire. McKinley was president at the time who just happens to be our president's favorite president. I also wrote another called Jamie MacGillivray which is about a Highlands Scottsman who's defeated at Culloden and sent as an indentured servant to the New World, instead of being hung by the British, and escapes and gets involved with the Indians in the French-Indian War. Robert Carlyle brought that to me.\n\nI've also just written a movie called Silver City which I think is about to come together. It's about a disgraced journalist who investigates a contemporary murder mystery set in the middle of a gubernatorial campaign in Colorado.\n\nDRE: Is your name going to be on The Alamo?\n\nJS: I've asked for it not to be. It was a lot of fun to work on it when Ron Howard was doing it. But the guy who's directing it now, John Lee Hancock, did a rewrite on it. I saw the set and its going to look really cool.\n\nDRE: Why do you not want your name on it?\n\nJS: Well I read the script that they say is the final movie. You either feel like it reflects it your work or not and this didn't.\n\nDRE: Is it getting harder to do political movies?\n\nJS: Part of it is because of the economic climate. The mainstream movie has kind of painted themselves into a corner. They're into winning the weekend at the box office and that's it. I was hearing recently that 2 Fast 2 Furious got about $18 million in endorsements just for having products in the movie. You have to be on 3,000 screens to make that money worth it. That has become the movie business and anything else is an aberration. Little movies have to compete with those movies.\n\nDRE: Are you still editing your movies traditionally?\n\nJS: Casa de los Babys is the first movie I've edited digitally. Some of it was because I need glasses to read now and we shot this in Super 16 mm to make the budget lower. I couldn't read all those little numbers on the film so I went digital. It was fun. A friend of mine from NYU came over and gave me a tutorial.\n\nDRE: You do a movie about every two years. You've written novels and written for countless other films. How do you find time to experience life to keep coming up with interesting stories?\n\nJS: I don't live in Hollywood which helps quite a bit. Most of friends don't work in the move business so I hear their stories. I play basketball which is nice because it's like jazz music, if you can play you can stay. There's nobody older than me playing. A lot of the guys I play with are firemen and cops because they work night shifts. I still travel quite a bit and you have to pay attention.\n\nDRE: Have you been writing for other directors lately?\n\nJS: I have and I like doing it. But it seems like the more I get paid the less likely the movie is to get made because if you get paid more you are probably working for a studio. They develop a lot of things but make a few. When I was working for Roger Corman, if he paid you $10,000 to write a screenplay he was going to make that movie. The last fun project I did was Mimic which Guillermo del Toro directed. It was a big cockroach movie."}
{"text":"Letters to Juliet is half a lovely, bittersweet movie about longing and romance and making mistakes and living with regret. Englishwoman Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) arrives in Verona, Italy, in search of the man she was in love with but ran away from half a century earlier. Meanwhile, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), an American on vacation, has taken up with the women who, as employees of the city, reply to all the lovelorn missives that heartbroken women leave for the fictional Juliet Capulet (of Romeo and Juliet fame) at Juliet's House.\n\nSophie discovers Claire's letter, lamenting her abandonment of poor, handsome Lorenzo, which had been stuffed in a crevice and overlooked for 50 years. Then she responds, telling Claire that it's never too late to chase after happiness.\n\nSophie is bored, you see, because her fianc\u00e9, Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), is busy meeting suppliers for the Tuscan restaurant he's about to open in New York, and she tags along on Claire's road trip of the surrounding countryside to find her Lorenzo. Accompanying Claire is her grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan), a truly unlikeable young man, and yet if you're of the suspicion that Sophie will eventually fall for Charlie, even though he's an odious, arrogant stick\u2013in\u2013the\u2013mud, you are not wrong.\n\nAnd that's where Letters to Juliet fails. Claire's story is deeply touching and beautifully performed by Redgrave and Seyfried. It's all gorgeously shot in the actual locations and will make you want to jump on a plane and stroll around Italy eating amazing food and drinking amazing wine and hopefully falling in love yourself (which you will embrace heartily and not run away from, now that you've seen how Claire regrets that she did). And in the smart, not-obvious version of Letters to Juliet, Sophie would not run away from Victor but would take a fresh look at why she fell in love with him in the first place. There must have been a reason, mustn't there, that she agreed to marry him? Or did she fall as quickly and inadvisably for Victor as she does for Charlie?\n\nI wish the screenwriters or director Gary Winick were able to convey a sense of Sophie making a bad decision, and that 50 years later, she'd be on her own search for Victor, to apologize for abandoning him with seemingly little reason. But there's no sense of that at all."}

Its rarity certainly hasn't hurt its early reputation as being a film that cannot be unseen, a film so shocking that it might technically be illegal for it to be shown in the United States.

{"text":"Highly recommended movie. Adapted from an American novel of the same name, Tell no one is a highly acclaimed French romantic thriller with outstanding character depths, the kind you will not often find in mainstream US movies. Dr. Alex Beck's soulmate and wife, Margot, was murdered 8 years ago and he was always the main suspect in the case. Suddenly, bodies are discovered near the location where she was found and the case is reopened. Beck also receives a strange email that only his defunct wife could have sent. When he suddenly finds out that he is being framed for the murder of a friend, he runs away and attempts to find out whether his wife is still alive. Brilliant acting across the board but obviously Francois Cluzet carried the movie. I haven't read the book but the background was transposed into France and it worked seamlessly.

His older brother, Seiyu (Kaname Jun), gave up further studies in spite of his outstanding academic results and emigrated to America at the request of their father so that he could send money back home and let his younger brother attend junior high school. Then one day in Okinawa in 1945, during the closing days of the Pacific War, the two brothers became enemies. In the fight, 16-year-old Koji who was now a child soldier with the Japanese army, sustained a critical gunshot wound and was prepared to die when he found himself face to face with his older brother. Seiyu had risked his life to return to his hometown in order to save his younger brother and family. However, they were able to transcend their countries and the war, to weather the crisis together ?\n\nSaigo no Kizuna: Okinawa Hikisakareta Kyodai Reviews\n\nSuch an extrodinary documentary\/film. The cast is great, the fact that it's based on fact is great, the music is very emotional, everything just works so perfectly.\n\nAn amazing insight too! But warning, have like 50boxes of tissues because tears will just roll and roll and never stop. Trully an inspiring docu\/film. But also it shows the reality of things and makes one want to work hard so that history NEVER repeats itself.\n\nIn a way yes it's a VERY sad thing to come to terms with and the stuff in it is sad but at the end,, you can't help but feel thankful, relief and happiness yet still sad. Thankful because you are alive now and not back during WW2 when it seems everything was unfair for everyone! Relief because of the bond of the family and how they end up. Happiness because of the brothers fate at the end. Sad because of the many lives that are lost and what they had to go through.\n\nI reccomend EVERYONE watched this! War things aren't my thing, I prefer to avoid things to do with wars, but seriously, watch this! It's SO worth watching something that you would normally hate watching! It's completely different to past war films like (thinking Western wise) Saving Private Ryan, Jarhead and Pearl Harbour which are just depressing and make you suicidal. This on this other hand is completely different to those in MANY ways! You'll understand when you see.."}
{"text":"Why Do People Hate Gwyneth Paltrow So Much? Also Contagion is excellent.\n\nUnder no circumstance should you go to a screening of Contagion without some sort of anti-bacterial gel or spray. Don't do it. Halfway through the film you'll find yourself fidgeting due to the palpable threat of unseen germs and you'll want that anti-bacterial goop. Take some. Or maybe some wipes. Because when Kate Winslet mentions the number of times a person touches their face each day you'll want to touch your face all the time and if you don't use a wipe you'll have a breakout like a fifteen year old horfing down a load of fast food.\n\nSteven Soderbergh new film puts you right back in 1994 when it seemed like every week there was a new virus threatening to destroy the world with one errant sneeze. Germs are scary. But in a nod to the modern \"Trust Us\" era the government isn't behind the disease. They're the ones desperately trying to solve the problem. There's no shadowy organization of crazy army guys or a bevy of black oil aliens. No overarching mystery. Just people succumbing to a plague.\n\nThere's a cerebral quality to Soderbergh's plague film. In a more traditional Hollywood film two characters brought together by improbable circumstances would find love. There'd be a gun fight. The cure would be found in the blood of some simple guy just trying to make it through his day. The bad guy would get his just desserts. Soderbergh teases us with these familiar tropes. He guides on a path that seems inexplicably bound for them, and at the last moment, like a good director with a background in independent cinema, he shows restraint and dials things back.\n\nThis is the real world where true love isn't found on a bus going 55mph and the cure isn't magically born from the blood of the immune. In the real world death is constant and blind and justice is meted out quite inefficiently and cures are not easy.\n\nAnd all of that is best exemplified in Jude Law's blogger character. It's like a condemnation of lazy Hollywood films and the internet all wrapped up in one morally repugnant character. Any other film he'd be our hero. He's good-looking and he's got his finger on the pulse of the problem. But this blogger is a completely selfish bastard. There's none of the altruism necessary in a hero. As a blogger myself I felt a little stung. Scott Z. Burns' script clearly has special and strong and virulent feelings for bloggers. It's hardly subtle, but it's never so angry that is muddies the message Burns and Soderbergh are attempting to convey with the character.\n\nDo all bloggers have highly distracting teeth problems, or just the ones that look like Jude Law?\n\nBut what amazes me more than Law's wonderful little bastard is how egalitarian this film is. Anyone could play the various characters of Contagion. Gwyneth Paltrow, the outbreak monkey, could have just as easily been played by George Clooney, or her onscreen husband, Matt Damon. Gender, which seems to be present in every movie I ever watch just isn't an issue in this film. These characters have bigger fish to fry. They're dealing with a virus that's more deadly and communicable than the Spanish flu man. They don't have time to get hung up on what is and isn't appropriate for a lady or a man. It's like this film was cast in a post feminism world.\n\nMatt Damon plays a father and husband who finds himself struggling to protect his family in a world ravaged by a disease. It's inferred that he's a stay at home dad. No one ever comments on it. His masculinity is never called into question and no one marvels at the novelty of his existence. Thank fucking God. Kate Winslet and Marion Cotillard's bad ass disease doctors get the same matter of fact treatment. They're highly regarded and extensively educated professionals with a job to do. How they dress, how they look, and their sex has nothing to do with it.\n\nAs the film progresses we find ourselves spending more and more times with characters only hinted at in trailers. Yes Damon is a major part of this film, and arguably its emotional core. But Laurence Fishburne's conflicted CDC rep and Jennifer Ehle's virologist are just as crucial.\n\nJennifer whose-it you ask?\n\nYou know the lady romancing Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice. She's been having a little bit of a comeback in the last few years in that she's actually appearing in films again. Here she's another CDC doctor out to cure the virus before we all go the way of Gwyneth.\n\nEhle isn't as familiar to audiences as the rest of the cast and there's an everywoman quality to her. If you HAVEN'T seen the 1995 Pride and Prejudice ad nauseam because in college your friends all had lady boners for Colin Firth and you aren't really into plays on the West End then she's just a side character that slowly becomes one of the primary characters. Her story is only really told in the latter half of the film but she gives her few scenes such weight and poignance that you find yourself remembering them much more fondly than the various abuses that Paltrow suffers.\n\nWhich brings me to a question. What is up with all the Gwyneth Paltrow hate? So the lady is a painfully out of touch Hollywood actress who won an Oscar for looking good in drag and making breast binding look whimsical. So what? Oh no she's organic! And she appears on Glee! And she made Country Strong! I'm over it. She's got a bit part here and people are comparing it to Janet Leigh in Psycho for obvious reasons, but she's solid and it never feels like a tease. Unless you're under a rock you know going in that she dies. It's less Janet Leigh in Psycho and more Steven Seagal in Executive Decision.\n\nAlso she's a Hollywood actress getting painfully close to forty and she appears sans makeup in this film. Props to her.\n\n\u2026\n\nAnd now I've turned this review into an essay on why it's brave for a Hollywood actress to appear sans makeup in a film. Someone sneeze on me. I don't want to liveI have never loved an actress more than I love Gywneth Paltrow. It's true. I am not even a little bit kidding.\n\nAnonymous\n\nI hate her, I'm afraid. It's visceral. She just seems really snotty.\n\nMsJack\n\nThe only reason I have for disliking Gwyneth is that she gave her daughter a horrible name. If your kid's name would sound stupid on a judge's placard (\"The Honorable Apple Blythe Martin\"), then you're doing it wrong, plus I have an intense dislike of our culture's tendency to assign women with frilly, non-serious-sounding names.\n\nShe also remarked on Oprah that the name is \"biblical,\" which made me roll my eyes. Yeah, okay, the word \"apple\" does appear in the Bible a few times, but only in passing mentions, mostly in poems or prophetic literature. It's never a significant theme, no more \"biblical\" than naming your kid Goat or Threshing Floor. Western culture has long associated apples with the tree in the Garden of Eden, but that isn't actually in the Bible. That's probably why she thought the name was \"biblical.\"\n\nI probably sound like I hate her, but I don't. That's the only thing she's done that I disliked. For the most part, I could take her or leave her.\n\nI did enjoy her cover of \"Forget You\" for Glee. Better than the original, IMO."}
{"text":"After a four-day coma Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) can't remember much other than taking a shower with his wife, Liz, which isn't so bad since she's played by January Jones. The trouble is that Liz doesn't recognize him anymore and another man (Aidan Quinn) claims to be the real Dr. Martin Harris, which leads to what's surely the biggest-ever mix-up at a Berlin biotechnical summit. The buzz: Lately Neeson's no stranger to major trouble in Europe (\"Taken\") or thrillers that stretch credibility like a rubber band wrapped around the equator (\"The Next Three Days\"). In \"Unknown,\" which is based on the novel \"Out of My Head,\" the question is only if the 58-year-old actor will be another veteran badass or just an intellectual at the center of a conspiracy. Or both? The verdict: Perhaps there's a place in the world where cabbies look like Diane Kruger, who plays the driver of the cab that tumbles off a bridge and puts Martin in a coma. Maybe viewers won't mind when Jones speaks like she's trying to remember her lines or when a creepy scenario continuously turns funny, such as when the two Martins speak in unison. What undoubtedly matters is the way \"Unknown\" twists a mystery into such nonsensical idiocy that the movie should be used in labs to monitor brain activity as it moves from curious to bored to annoyed.\n\nDid you know? Martin indicates that women are brave to marry scientists. Consider what other professions (scientist's assistant?) you'd find even less desirable for a spouse"}
{"text":"Every week there are great movies released in theaters, but they get no attention and never have a chance to reach an audience. They are rarely released on more than ten screens, only in New York City and Los Angeles, and have no advertising, but they are works of art that deserve to be seen. That's why I started this column. It's a way for me to spread the gospel about the great independent films, foreign films, and documentaries that don't get the attention they deserve from the movie-going public. So while you're killing time between screenings of Paranormal Activity 2 and Saw 3D, you can find out about some great movies that aren't getting talked about on Entertainment Tonight or, really, anywhere else\u2026 ever. Until now!\n\nIt's always fun going into a movie not really knowing what it's about. In our age of media information overload, where overly obsessed writers divulge every piece of information about every movie on websites like [CENSORED BY EDITOR], this is an almost impossible goal, but entering a theater without any knowledge of what you are about to experience can be incredible. Over the last decade this has only happened to me three times, and fortunately all of the movies are great. Added to the list that includes Rocket Science and Edmond is the British dramatic thriller The Disappearance of Alice Creed.\n\nPart of the joy of seeing this movie is that I had absolutely no idea of what was going to happen, so I am going to provide as little plot information as possible so that when you see this movie (and I assume you see every movie I recommend), you will share in that experience. So here is my plot summary: two men kidnap Alice Creed. That's all the bait you're getting fishies, until you see the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will expound, however, upon the many qualities that make this movie so stunningly good. For me, the two most apt comparisons for The Disappearance of Alice Creed are Hard Candy and Crank. Like those two films, this film holds absolutely nothing back, attacking the viewer with a barrage of horrifying imagery. You don't have the time to get your butt into a comfortable position on the seat before you are forced to the edge, and the suspense never lets up. There are multiple twists and turns that are completely unexpected (no, I won't give you any hints; it'll be better if you experience them fresh and clueless like I did) and the film flies through its brisk 96 minutes, giving you precious few moments to catch your breath.\n\nHowever, without great performances, this movie could come off as arthouse-style torture porn. Fortunately, the film's three leads are superb, giving some of the best performances of the year. Eddie Marsan isn't a name you're likely to recognize, but you've surely seen him in Sherlock Holmes, and as the misanthropic driving instructor in Happy-Go-Lucky. Given a starring role, Marsan shows just how remarkably talented he is. He takes an incredibly complex character and always makes him feel like a real person, someone you can simultaneously hate and pity. A dominating, terrifying presence in the film, Marsan is able to shine in a performance reminiscent of Tom Hardy's similarly overlooked performance in Bronson.\n\nBut the true linchpin of the film is the title character, played by Gemma Arterton. You might know Arterton as Quantum of Solace's Bond girl, or as Jake Gyllenhaal's love interest in The Prince of Persia, and perhaps you don't have the highest opinion of her as an actress. But my God, she is truly phenomenal here. Arterton is given a phenomenally difficult task and proves herself to be a completely fearless performer. Watching what happens to her during the course of the film can be difficult, but she never backs down, and her performance makes the film. Hopefully she will continue to choose parts like this, rather than the Hollywood tripe she is known for.\n\nI could continue to rant about the performance of Martin Compston, the tight script and the superb direction, but I'm afraid that I might give something away, so I'll stop now. Sadly, I only caught this film at the last second before it Disappeared from theaters (clever wordplay, right?), so you won't get the same opportunity. But get your Netflix queues ready and start lining up outside of your nearest Redbox, because you are going to want to see this movie as soon as it comes out on DVD."}
{"text":"Born on the Fourth of July\n\nTom Cruise, Bryan Larkin, Raymond J. Barry, Caroline Kava, Josh Evans\n\nDirected by Oliver Stone\n\nTeenager Ron Kovic joined the marines, went to Vietnam to be a hero and came back in a wheelchair. In his 1976 autobiography, Kovic told how his illusions about God, country and manhood were shattered along with his spinal cord. As Kovic, Tom Cruise gives an astounding, deeply felt performance. For over two hours, under the pile-driving direction of Oliver Stone (Platoon), Cruise takes us on a grueling journey. The film spans three decades, moving Kovic through adolescence, Vietnam, therapy and his later involvement with the antiwar movement, which led to his becoming a spokesman for disabled veterans. That's a lot to cram in. The transitions blur, events are compressed, and subsidiary characters are swallowed up in the vast kaleidoscope. But Stone has found in Cruise the ideal actor to anchor the movie with simplicity and strength. Together they do more than show what happened to Kovic. Their fervent, consistently gripping film shows why it still urgently matters"}
{"text":"This review contains some spoilers for folks who haven't read the books.\n\nLike many of our most popular cultural artifacts, The Hunger Game is a Leatherman of a series, a multi-purpose tool for discussing everything from war and insurgency (as always, read Amy Davidson) to an increasingly brutal college admissions process. But on the occasion of the movie adaptation's arrival in theaters, it's worth returning to the franchise's title: this is a story about a country in which the unimaginably rich manipulate the desperately poor with incredible cruelty, and where a fossilized class system treats people who want to survive it, much less rise from one class into the next, with violence and sadism. The Hunger Games begins in a world where roses are imaginable, and bread is a commodity so valuable that its arrival is a symbol from the heavens and it can create emotional ties that last a lifetime. The Hunger Games is also about war, and democracy, and torture, and personal autonomy, but all of those consequences and conversations are offshoots of a basic setup: a world where a few people have anything and many people have almost nothing.\n\nA movie about savage inequalities is almost absurdly timely, even if we don't live in a world where the citizens of subject states each much send two children between 12 and 18 to fight to the death in a televised competition for the amusement of the vastly wealthy, and the temporary economic elevation of a lucky survivor and his or her family. And The Hunger Games is at its best when it puts the rich and their victims in contact, though it falters when it comes to portraying the competition between those who are desperately hoping to rise.\n\nSome of the most biting work in The Hunger Games comes from the adult actors, and from a series of scenes that illustrate how excess can be as anaesthetizing as it is rewarding. \"You two are in for a treat,\" trills Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), the noxious MC of the District 12 Reaping, after Katniss and Peeta have been separated from their families and boarded the luxury train that is sweeping them off to their likely deaths. \"Crystal chandeliers! Platinum doorknobs!\" It's more likely that the young people in her over-manicured care will appreciate regular access to food than the post-apocalyptic equivalent of the Restoration Hardware catalogue. But Effie can't possibly acknowledge the immiseration that creates her elaborate outfits, powers the bullet train on which she travels, and covers the tables at which her charges can eat only once they're marked for slaughter.\n\nLater in the movie, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), Katniss and Peeta's drunken but not un-savvy mentor, blanches watching a Capitol family gives their children play toys for a battle they'll never have to fight. For them, the Hunger Games are another opportunity to consume, to place bets and to host elaborate parties, rather than evidence of their own investment in injustice. The pageantry leading up to the Games distances the viewers from what they're actually watching. The public coffers supply Katniss and Peeta with a sumptuously-furnished apartment, designer training tracksuits, gorgeous outfits to wear to pre- and post-competition interviews with the fantastically unctuous Ceaser Flickerman (Stanley Tucci). The movie doesn't make this as clear as the books do, but the traumas of the games themselves are an opportunity for further personal consumer spending. If you give good show, as Katniss and Peeta do, their mentors can persuade sponsors to buy Tributes necessities ranging from a cup of hot soup to antibiotic creams that arrive, like everything else considered a luxury in this world, in hues and textures that make them look plucked from a Wet 'n' Wild line of eye glitter.\nWhat for residents of the Capitol is a matter of consumerist dilettantism is for everyone else a brutal one-person escape valve for an entire continent's aspirations to rise above their class. Rather than giving everyone an opportunity to improve their lot, Panem requires that its citizens accept unbearable personal risk for even minor improvements in their access to basic resources. Want more grain and oil for your family? You can get it, but only if you're willing to accept an increased chance of getting picked as a Tribute. Want a opportunity to move your family permanently into better housing, and to win increased food allocations to your district for a year? Then step right up to the Hunger Games\u2014and if you're lucky enough to survive (particularly when your competition's been groomed to kill you since birth, making a lie of this theoretical meritocracy) and become a victor, be very aware of the fact that you might have to head back into the arena for the Quarter Quell, held every 25 years, which pits Hunger Games champions against each other. These are menacingly punitive disincentives to want something better, much less to actually reach for it.\n\nThe movie, by necessity, has the same problem as Collins' novel: it's about the children who have an incomplete view of the system and its incentive structure, rather than the adults who are fully aware of its implications. The full scope of Panem's culture, politics and technology are frustratingly tempting, and mostly out of view. We know that Katniss's mother succumbed to depression in the wake of her husband's death in a mining accident. But we only get a sense of Katniss's contempt for that failure of will, rather than a sense of the crushing despair her mother must have experienced. Panem took her hopes, and its industry took her husband. She's old enough to know exactly how sick a joke it is to tell Hunger Games competitors \"May the odds be ever in your favor.\" The odds are never in your favor.\n\nKeeping the motivations and emotions of adults opaque isn't the only way the movie adaptation ofThe Hunger Games blunts the full impact of the Capitol's brutality. It was inevitable, given the age of the novels' core fan base, that the movie would have to aim to get a PG-13 rating, and it earns that commercially-vital stamp by minimizing the book's brutal violence at every turn. When Katniss attacks a group of Career tributes with Tracker Jackers, genetically engineered wasps with super-strong venom, the scene's shot in the same jittery fashion as many of the action sequences, making it hard to see the impact of the bugs clearly. Katniss, who is stung, pries a bow from the dead hands of a girl who is killed by the insects' venom, and we see her rival's body through her distorted, hallucinatory vision: it's a framing that denies both us and Katniss a clear-eyed reckoning with the murder she's done, even in self-defense. Later, the act that marks Katniss as a rebel is the decision to mourn and decorate the body of a Tribute with whom she'd teamed up with, not in temporary self-interest but out of affinity. But while little Rue's body, strewn with flowers, is a pathetic, moving sight, most of the other dead female Tributes get the same treatment from the camera: they may be cut, or artfully smeared with mud, but their unmarked skin is flawless, their eyes liquid and glossy even in death. They're like dead deer, rather than dead people.\n\nWe only see the trauma of these deaths, and then only in part, at the very end of the competition when a Career named Cato, who has been the most vicious competitor in the Games, confronts Peeta and Katniss. He's bloodied and hysterical, aware for the first time that he's been raised not to win, but to provide an excellent show in the course of his dying. When Katniss kills him, it's an act of mercy, his torment hidden under a writhing mass of the beasts who are devouring him. She's Diana, but instead of turning Acteon into a deer and feeding him to the wolves as punishment for him seeing her nakedness, she is dispatching him out of, if not love, contempt for the system that put them both in that position.\n\nBut her reward isn't escape. Instead, Katniss and Peeta are repackaged as consumer goods themselves, dressed up in even more elaborate costumes for their return to Flickerman's couch, and paraded out on tour for Panem's citizens to adore. The Hunger Games may be a brutal pageant. They're also, as it turns out, a form of product testing"}

{"text":"Of the many questions posed by \"The Conspirator,\" and left unresolved, the most pressing are these: How much did Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) know of the plot to kill Abraham Lincoln? How could she not have known of it, given that some of it was hatched within the respectable boarding house that she ran in Washington, D.C.? If her son John (Johnny Simmons), who certainly did know of the plot, had surrendered to the authorities, rather than remaining on the run, could he have saved his mother's skin? Why did Andrew Johnson, the new President, reject the last-minute, late-night application by Surratt's lawyer for a retrial? And was there ever any likelihood, considering the public revulsion at the murder, that she would receive a fair trial in the first place?\n\n(T)he film is, at its core, a courtroom drama about (Mary) Surratt's military tribunal trial and the efforts of her attorney, a young Civil War hero played by James McAvoy, to obtain justice for a woman seen as guilty before the trial began. Like the rest of the film, the tribunal scenes stay as close as possible to history. Two transcripts of Surratt's trial were used to craft the script. \"Much of what you see is literally pulled from the transcripts,\" said Producer Brian Falk. \"When we could, we used verbatim.\"\n\nRedford's film, based on a script by James D. Solomon, is stately and respectable to a fault: It's too safe. It feels the need to bang us over the head with how important it is. And Redford is trying way too hard to make these events from a century and a half ago seem like a relevant metaphor for where we are as a nation post-9\/11.\n\nYou never see [Lincoln's] face. I made a point of not showing his face except little pieces here and there. You can't duplicate that face. When a face is that well-known, you're better off suggesting than showing it.\n\n\"The Conspirator,\" though, fails to blow dust off its period. \u2026 After the first reel, there's rarely any sense of a larger polis outside the museum-room interiors, uniformly lit by cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel in clear, streaming shafts of perpetual-noon sunlight. The film is a burdensome two hours, even as some scenes seem to have gone missing, like the brushed-past plot point with Shea Whigham as a witness for the defense suborned by the prosecution, wasted along with Alexis Bledel and Evan Rachel Wood.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss \"The Conspirator\" as a dramatized civil-liberties lecture with obvious implications re: Guant\u00e1namo. But if the decade since 9\/11 has taught us anything, it's that we haven't been very well taught. Redford does a fine, economical job re-creating the horror of the assassination, the dying president barely glimpsed but the bowls of blood carried from his deathbed all too vivid.\n\nI won't see you there, however. The ALO and company are off to Washington, D.C. on Saturday. Plans are, one day next week, for our group to visit Ford's Theatre, have dinner at the former Mary Surratt Boarding House (now an Asian restaurant called \"Wok 'n' Roll\") and finish off the evening at a screening of \"The Conspirator.\""}
{"text":"Synopsis The residents of WIE Island are excited at the possibility of being compensated if the island becomes a cultural tourist area. However, an unexpected accident turns the area into an island of mysteries. The unique choreography and the director's determination to dig into the double-sidedness of an individual and a group stand out.\n\nReview An island is a miniature of the world. It is rare to find a more attractive place to show the selfishness of a group of people, twisted human desires, and the madness derived from a sealed-off world than an island. In this natural stage most suitable for mysteries and thrillers, a case unfolding itself covers the screen with ambiguous sentiments like the mist at dawn. Wie - Do takes place in wie Island in Bu-an, Jeollabuk-do. It is a thriller that digs into the hidden truths behind a murder case that takes place on the island. Selected as a pilot area for culture and tourism, high expectations for redevelopment engulf the island. One day, In-chul (Jeong Chan), a detective visits the island. He had been sent to investigate the precise cause of death of Jong-gu, who had died in a landslide. In-chul senses something strange from the island people from the first day on. Though he's not happy with the cold behavior from the island people who want him to wrap things up quietly and leave, In-chul even takes tainted money to pay for his wife's hospital bills then eventually decides to leave the island. That night, another murder case takes place and In-chul has a hunch that the island people's odd behavior and the series of events are linked. Then he jumps right in the middle of the repulsive truth that the people had been hiding. Wie - Do persistently chases how far human beings' selfishness will go when buried within a group. It somewhat loses suspense with conventional story development and over explanations near the end, but the directing rhythm that chases the case is not bad. However, it is somewhat of a let-down that the film didn't fully capture the unique attractiveness of the actually existingplace, Wie Island.

There is no way on or off this rock unless you take the ferry. So the real question how can someone disappear. She was in her cell that last time she was seen and now has vanished. The lead is Leonardo DiCaprio and though the movie he either nails the seen or seems to get it totally wrong. I am not sure about the Boston accent he tries to pull off. Sometimes it seems to me he is just trying to hard and with that it seems awkward. On the island the doctor is Dr. Cawley played by Ben Kingsley who does a great job with this role. He really sells being the caring doctor. The story itself is a jumble of twists and turns that really keep a person interested. One thing that really sells the feel of the movie is the soundtrack. It really complements the tone and atmosphere of the movie. As with a lot of movies, this one just would not have as great of a feel if it was not for the soundtrack. Overall I enjoyed watching the movie, for parts of it I was sitting on the edge of my seat. The twists and turns keep me wondering were the story was going. If I had any small disappointment I would have to say it does kind of dwindle a little towards the end. Granted a lot of the thrill of the movie goes away once it starts to resolve what is going on. From my standpoint it was less dramatic then maybe what I was thinking. None the less it is well worth a watch."}

{"text":"Movie Review: It Might Get Loud\n\nDavis Guggenheim wanted to make a documentary about the electric guitar. But what he created was far more \u2013 a portrait of the artists as men.\n\nJimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, The Edge of U2, and Jack White of The White Stripes and The Raconteurs. The buildup to their meeting is beautifully orchestrated, each talking in the back of their own town car, heading to a nicely upholstered showdown at high noon.\n\nThey come from their respective corners to meet in the well-lit center of a huge studio. There is a moment of silence, hands are shaken and then each settles warily into his own corner. No one is sure what might happen next.\n\nGuggenheim manages to strike a balance between the current incarnations of the artists, and where they came from \u2013 why they began playing; how they got to be who they are. In a combination of individual interviews and historical footage threaded through this two-day \"summit,\" we are given a picture of these men as musicians, as creators, and as people. They are guitarists of different generations, influences, places in their lives, and the world. But their common drive to create makes them shine on the screen and pound in your ears.\n\nThe most incredible moments happened when the guitarist started talking about how they make \"their sound.\" Academically, it's easy to say that Zeppelin sounds different than U2 and different than The Ranconteurs, but it's harder to quantify exactly why. But then Jimmy Page starts discussing how he first discovered distortion pedals to create sustain, so a single note can go on to infinity, and you're hearing the sonic boom of Led Zeppelin. And then The Edge starts voicing an E-chord: moving the rich inner notes out and paring it down until it's the ringing, glorious tones that are U2. And when Jack White sits in a plain wooden room talking about his constant need to work against the circumstances, through warped wood and out of tune strings, searching for the rawest, realest sound possible where all the emotion is out on the surface, everything he's done makes just a bit more sense.\n\nMoving from Page's home in England, to Edge's studio in Ireland, and White's farm in North Carolina, the picture of who these artists are becomes more and more clear. There is a lot of discussion of the instrument itself, and what it is capable of. The Edge is central in these scenes, as his studio is practically a sonic supercomputer, with huge arrays of effect pedals and distorters. Page and White stand in interesting contrast to this, as Page was developing his sound at a time when the technology was new, and White searches for the lo-fi version of it all: a crackly-edged sound form an old LP."}
{"text":"Picks and Pans Review: Master and Commander:The Far Side of the World\n\nThis seagoing drama puts a viewer so convincingly in the middle of the action on board a British warship in 1805 that you'll swear you can feel the salt spray. The rousing story of how Capt. Jack Aubrey (Crowe), commander of the HMS Surprise, and his crew determinedly pursue a larger, faster, French enemy vessel around Cape Horn is Hollywood filmmaking at its smartest and most satisfying.\n\nFans of nautical novelist Patrick O'Brian are likely to be enraptured by Master and Commander, given that it has been so adroitly adapted by director-cowriter Peter Weir (The Truman Show) from the 1st and 10th books of O'Brian's 20-volume series. Let me stress, though, that having devoured the books isn't a prerequisite for enjoying the film and its up-close look at what officers and sailors ate, where they slept and how ship-to-ship combat was conducted during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nAt the heart of both the novels and M&C is the warm but occasionally contentious friendship between Captain Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin (Bettany), the ship's sawbones. The captain is a man of action and Maturin a more introspective sort, but each is capable of moving beyond type to surprise the other (and us). And both do much to earn, and keep, the respect of the ship's crew.\n\nCrowe again proves he is that rarity: a major movie star who can actually act. No firebrand, his Captain Aubrey shoulders the heavy mantle of leadership with a hard-won knowledge of its weight. Bettany, if less charismatic, is equally effective. (PG-13)"}
{"text":"Twenty years ago, my father made a video for my mother's 40th birthday that he unveiled at her surprise party. The homemade movie contained a lengthy dream sequence in where my father overdubbed this ridiculous, fake back story of my mother's life that he narrated while providing silly voices in place of the few characters within. His magnum opus was never shown at a film festival, but Francophrenia (or: Don't Kill Me, I Know Where the Baby Is) is pretty much a larger-scale version of the same thing. While Francophrenia is entertaining at times in its self-proclaimed examination of stardom and ego, I'd much rather watch the fortieth-birthday video.\n\nYou may have forgotten by now (or never knew), but James Franco booked a stint on the long-running soap opera General Hospital. No, this was not when he was young and starting off\u2013this was when he was nominated for an Academy Award. He played a twisted artist\/killer named Franco, if you can believe it. As the show was shooting the grand finale of the characters story arch (apparently it never was completed), Franco (the real one) had a camera crew following him around. Once the entire ordeal was over, James asked documentary film maker Ian Olds to edit down the massive amount of footage into a behind-the- scenes documentary. Instead, with Franco's approval, he turned the whole thing into an experimental \"thriller\" that is meant to poke and prod at the idea of celebrity\u2013from the viewpoint of both the star and the fans.\n\nAt only seventy minutes, Francophrenia (or: Don't Kill Me, I Know Where the Baby Is), should be a breeze to sit through. On the contrary, the first twenty minutes of the film are split between Franco greeting fans and getting lost on his way to the set. Finally, after a few takes of him delivering a crucial line (take a guess), the true madness behind this experiment gets under way. Amidst shots of Franco sporting devious looks and shady profiles, an odd voice over comes through. \"Stay cool, stay cool. What am I doing here? Who is that, they're after me. Stay cool.\" The whispering voice of Ian Olds opens a doorway into the head of James Franco. It's cute and funny; suddenly things are looking up. That is until it just keeps repeating the same junk, over and over.\n\nOne quirky idea is stretched out along the final fifty minutes of this tedious test of the viewers patience. Here and there a new laugh kicks in as suddenly the figures on a bathroom door begin to speak as well, but it leads nowhere but a blackened hole of the audiences madness. As more footage of fans asking for pictures and of Franco's face plastered all over the place, it's easy to understand what they were shooting for. Maybe Olds was hoping that I, as a viewer, would start my own inner dialogue: \"What am I doing here? Why am I watching this nonsense? Do the guy behind me just fart? When will this end?\" If that was the intention, he succeeded, but it in no way fits the description provided.\n\nAs another Tribeca 2012 entry, Eddie: The Sleepwalking Cannibal illustrates, it's possible to take what sounds like a gimmick and make it work at a feature length. Francophrenia, on the other hand, does the exact opposite, leaving me wishing it was a short whimsical experience\u2013like a well-made fortieth birthday video"}
{"text":"The Magic Christian (1969) was mostly villified on its original release. Words like \"tasteless\" and \"incomprensible\" were thrown around very freely indeed. Time, however, has been kind to the film. Its reputation has grown considerably\u2014though not to the point that it has entirely lost its controversy. And that's a good thing, since a non-controversial Magic Christian would not be in the least desirable. This is a film that was meant to polarize viewers\u2014and it still does. Consider that it is a film that steadfastly refuses to ever explain its plot or assign a point to any of what happens. Its trailer is in the same key, since it refuses to tell the viewer who or what \"The Magic Christian\" is, leaving the deliberately provocative title provocatively unclear. The film itself doesn't reveal what it is until late in the proceedings and leaves the \"why\" of the name choice entirely up to the viewer. What we know from the outset is that Sir Guy Grand is filthy rich (and eccentric) and that Youngman (Ringo) is a young man Sir Guy meets in the park\u2014and immediately adopts. From there\u2014well, the viewer is asked to follow their adventures and make sense out of them. If you can, it's exhilirating in its utter anarchy. If you can't, it's probably frustrating. But you'll never know till you try\u2014and even if you have tried, there are so many subtle jokes in the film that you almost certainly didn't get them all.

{"text":"The close shots of sweat-coated faces were stunning. Beautifully framed photography permeated right through, and into a final act that resolved - and crumbled - in a regressing cycle of tiny thwarting misfortunes. Thrilling and exquisite - a truly great heist film.\n\nSet the tone for future heist films like \"The Killing\" or \"Heat\" (which were IMO better), but Rififi is amazing on its own: exciting, entertaining and gripping, a true classic !!! \"Wake up, you bastard, I don't want you to miss anything\" ==> bam\n\nSuperb location photography, great characterisation and a definitive heist sequence make this a must-see noir. The taut narrative and risque interaction between the underworld characters hasn't dated, but the inevitable tragedy for all involved felt like a product of its time.\n\nCertainly a heist movie. The basic plot points are about what you'd expect and I found it quite reminiscent to Bob le Flambeur, only with less engaging characters. Where this movie finds its footing is in the architecture of individual scenes\/sequences. The famous dialogue-free heist and the overall look of the film elevated the material so it felt fresh. The style was noticeable but not intrusive.\n\nThe centerpiece heist scene is amazing, the way sound is used in that sequence really heightens the tension. The rest of the film is very good as well, I thought most of the characters were pretty strong. Besides a few minor things I disliked about it, I think it's a great film overall.\n\nA flawless heist film against which all others should be judged. The elliptical narrative is a masterful example of classic dramatic structure. The first act functions as introduction to Tony le Stephanois, utterly down-and-out, and a perpetually grey, rain-soaked criminal underworld. Most famous is the near-silent robbery, as methodical and suspenseful as anything Hitchcock ever filmed. Finally the film deteriorates into a tragedy of Greek proportions, never relenting its bleak disposition.\n\none or two mixed bag elements, the ending was especially iffy. my biggest gripes are a couple things that make no logical sense, making plans over the phone while never really actually giving a where or when, and a mother pulling her child out of a crashed car while leaving her dying brother-in-law there without a second thought. the actual lead up to and heist it's self are utterly awesome. good watch, not to be ignored.\n\nThis is a really cool French crime film. The heist scene itself was awesome. I loved how meticulous they were (both the characters and the filmmakers). That's only half the film though - the rest is the consequences of the crime. It ended up being far more exciting and suspenseful than I anticipated. I really enjoyed it overall. It also shows how the French were leagues ahead of the US in terms of pushing the envelope content-wise.\n\nDark, dreary Paris; in this film a shower of deep shades of black and grey. A notorious, immoral underworld of doom and gloom, and inevitably death (and with it, failure). The perfect heist does not exist, the minute details, the promise of glory and riches unknown to the common man (and its seeming immortality) are all illusions. We know it, the crooks know it, but somehow they still search and try their hand, always coming up with a bitter fate. The best heist scene ever.\n\nOne of the two best heist movies along with Heat I have ever seen only this one was engineered in 1955. Sadly the heist movies of today are all flawed and depend mostly on jumping thru the laser lines in the vault room or overriding voice recognition coded, finger print coded security systems and a lame love story.\nThe heist directots of today who can't understand why they fail to build proper tension and emotion despite such scenes, should study Rififi first.\n\nClearly, Rififi set a benchmark for future heist-movies. Nevertheless, it still got a bunch of startling scenes that can make your jaw drop. It can't be said often enough how much tension is created without words during the actual heist-scene. Another impressive scene is the final scene when the excellently narrated story finds its climax - storytelling-wise as well as filmmaking-wise. 04\/07\/09\n\nAn extremely well crafted Heist\/Noir movie. The actors that played the four robbers are absolutely fabulous and make a very compelling crew. The actual robbery scene literally had me on the edge of my seat and really got my heart beating. But after that section of the movie it started to lag a bit for me, but was still irresistible to watch."}
{"text":"Audition\n\nSynopsis\n\nSeven years after the death of his wife, company executive Aoyama is invited to sit in on auditions for an actress. Leafing through the resum\u00e9s in advance, his eye is caught by Yamazaki Asami, a striking young woman with ballet training.\n\nProlific Japanese director Takashi Miike is known to stir up controversy with his film's graphic content, and this is perhaps his most disturbing. Yet, at the same time, it is tame and slow-paced compared to something like Ichi the Killer (2001). But it quickly descends into gruesome, grotesque madness; the final act will exhaust even the strongest stomachs. Although, what some might mistake for tasteless, torture-porn violence is nothing of the sort. Miike's patient plotting and tender treatment of his tortured characters hints at the ultimate terrors in store for us.\n\nA middle-aged widower, Aoyama, decides to conduct an audition to find his ideal women. He is immediately smitten by Asami Yamazaki, she is quiet and mysterious. Aoyama's friend, Yoshikawa,\u2026\n\nIf you really want to know what this film can do to you, read as little about it as you can. That's what happened to me and I have to confess, this film haunted me for quite some time. That all had to do with the typical slow, meticulous build up you often see in Asian films. This pace provides a perfect platform for Takashi Miike to showcase his sadism and his understanding what true horror is all about. He sinks his hooks into you, the viewer, by making you care for a very sympathetic leading man and then, halfway, he rips those hooks out with force and uncompromising terror.\n\nIf you're not aware, based on a novel by Ryu Murakami, director Takashi Miike's Audition is surprisingly deliberate and straightforward for much of its length. It's not a bad film at all, but most of it is in the realm of realist drama, even becoming something of a romance at one point. There are a few brutal images and scenarios, but they arrive primarily towards the end of the film, and they tend to be more conceptually disturbing than graphically violent.\n\nAudition is the story of Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), who is living alone with his son, Shigehiko (Tetsu Sawaki), after his wife, Ryoko (Miyuki Matsuda), passes away. First egged on by Shigehiko, Shigeharu decides to remarry. He enlists the\u2026\n\nI usually go out of my way to avoid any information about movies that I want to see. Trailers show too much, plot descriptions go past the first act, etc, etc. I know that I'm not alone in this. So, what gives with the movie poster art, here? \"Audition\" is a slow burn story about a middle-aged man looking for a second wife. It's a simple premise, and I found it to be pretty boring. Probably because all I could think about was, \"OK, when is this craz-o gonna put on those rubber gloves?\" I don't know if that was supposed to be a twist - I mean, the foreshadowing is obviously there - but \"Rosemary's Baby\" this is not.\u2026\n\nMy main beef with this film: the cover\/poster\/all round promotional material. Surely the twist of this film comes from not knowing she's a syringe-wielding psycho? I mean, yeah, I get that there's artistic merit in watching a story progress to that point, but I always found myself waiting for her to don the rubber gloves. (I also had another twist spoiled by reading a 'looking back' review 10 years or so after the fact, but that's my fault for not getting on it earlier I suppose).\n\nAlso, I know it's harder to tell in a foreign language, but the acting in this struck me as particularly guff. Still, an intriguing story, and that 'it was all a dream' fake-out made me laugh - twas interesting to explore that concept until it just about became tedious.\n\nOk, so this movie was a killer film, metaphorically and broadly speaking. Sometimes when I watch a film, and there is a scene that is completely disgusting I begin to laugh out of control, because my mind cannot take it, and for some reason begins to crack up. The ending torture scene for this film was like that for me, now I'm not going to ruin it for anyone cause it was intense, but it may force you to do a few double takes here and there. Overall it was a cool film, and though it did have its weak points, I still enjoyed it. Its good to watch some really gory foreign films every now and then."}
{"text":"Why does Criterion sometimes use the title of the film in its original language, and other times translates it to English? Why no consistency?\n\nAs Jun-Dai notes, they tend to go with whichever title has the most currency in their market, and if it's a tough call, they usually opt for English.\n\nIn the case of this film, however, it was such a flop at the time that it got hardly any exposure - even in France. I think its original American release title was Me - which for only two letters is a whole shitload of awful - and neither of the available translations (Naked Childhood and Naked Youth), quite apart from being -ah- problematic, have ever really caught on (plus one of those is an alternative title for one of their forthcoming Oshima films, so there's another headache they need to avoid). If people are familiar with the film, it's most likely from Pialat retrospectives where the film has retained its original title. Pialat gave several of his films titles that didn't translate well (e.g. the bland \"To Our Loves\", the blunt \"Graduate First!\", the brutal \"Mouth Agape\"). Given the alternatives, I think we should be thankful Criterion have opted for the French original in this instance.\n\nThe criterion is hideous, the worst I've seen from them in a while. It looks like the stretching is mostly on Crits plate. God, that couldn't be worse. The MOC is basically the same package right? If so I'll be canceling my order on the Crit.\n\nRather disappointing. The stretching \/ squashing is so slight I honestly can't recall which is more accurate (I've seen the film twice in 35mm), but the golden filter on the Criterion definitely doesn't ring true for me. I recall the colours (which are very important to the film - selected primaries against neutral backgrounds) being stark, clear and plain.\n\nIt's also a great shame to lose half of the Champs \/ Contre Champs interview, since it offers Pialat at his most bullishly obstreperous, pissing contempt all over the set and splashing a lot of it on himself.\n\nEDIT: Don't know if MoC have settled on their August sale titles yet, but it might be a good time to offer up that Pialat package again!\n\nIf you look at the boy's face in the second to last comparison (of him holding onto a bookshelf) then I think it's fairly clear that the criterion is the version with stretching. Why is it that the big C seems to have had consistent problems getting color balance right of late (rather than just on Ozu releases)?Hate to beat a dead horse, but on a similar note, Crit has been \"standardizing\" b&w films for years. I just recently watched Trouble in Paradise, and there were moments where the grain was far too heavy and the corners of the screen far too dark (not unlike their M Blu-ray). Major portions of that film are in darkness anyways, and I watch on a very bright monitor. Compared to a nice, grain-filled, and well-balanced Design for Living from Universal, I was surprised how far Crit was willing to go for their own tastes. In the case of B&W, sometimes it works wonders. Other times, definitely not. The color-meddling, too, seems to have bled out from their Melville and Ozu releases into, uh, everything else. I enjoy doing the \"eyeball\" test at home, setting my display wherever I think is best; for Criterion to do the same apparently research-less finangling on the \"definitive\" R1 digital editions is just sad.\n\nSvevan, regards Design for Living, I think Crit has not always been given the best masters from Universal. Another egregious example is their lousy Scarlet Empress. But then they dig away at them and get Uni to turn up that fine HD master of the McCarey.....\n\nAnd I need to weigh up my concerns about a couple of color Blu Ray titles with several recently bought by me that look terrific - Bigger than Life, Walkabout, Days of Heaven, Empire of the Senses..... no color manipulation issues whatsoever.\n\nThe Criterion has significantly more information on either side, they're the exact same aspect ratio, yet the Criterion must be stretched. That logic doesn't follow.\n\nAs I see it, the amount of information on either side is irrelevant to the issue of stretching, or at the very least far from conclusive. Far more persuasive to me is that fact that the boy's face looks distorted in the Criterion caps, and doesn't in the MoC ones.\n\nAnd that's one fat 1960s French toddler in the MOC. Logically, with the MOC missing information on either side, it may have been stretched horizontally to fill out the correct aspect ratio. Just saying.\n\nLogic v. opinion. (And the Down syndrome reference is a little out there.) All I can offer is this: presumably the Criterion cover art is from a publicity shot rather than a frame capture. Compare the width of his profile there to the screenshots. Or if you don't want to go by the cover, google around."}
{"text":"It was the unexpected film that sneaked up on us in the early part of 2012. Little known until then, Looper promised to be an enthralling and intense sci-fi thriller, with plenty of action and plot twists. Applauded by (most) critics, it's been heralded as \"the next Matrix\". As someone who is intimately familiar with that sci-fi epic, Looper isn't particularly deserving of the title. I was expecting something akin to Christopher Nolan's Inception, but what you get is a lot more like The Butterfly Effect. It's certainly gritty and has copious moments of tension, but if you're looking for something to work your grey matter, I'd think again.\n\nFounded in 2002, Warp Films have had a mighty busy ten years, shepherding such films as Dead Man's Shoes, Donkey Punch, This is England, Submarine and Four Lions to critical and commercial success.

Although derided by the majority of critics, something about it resonated with audiences.

Maybe it was Liam Neeson earning his title as a man's man, playing Bryan Mills, a father with a 'special set of skills' who turned up the badass-o-meter when he his daughter is kidnapped or that the film featured a script that wasn't afraid to go to some very dark places"}
{"text":"A movie which can be watched like an elegy\n\nThat is right, Elegy, a masterpiece which was badly and unjustly overlooked last year and could easily have gone after some Oscars, can be watched like an elegy, like a sad song, a lament, like a poem where the poet is mourning for something unrecoverable, something which he lost and can't get back. But it is only in the second part of the movie, the part which is a stereotypical but wonderful paraphrase of Lolita, where the aged professor David Kepesh (the unique Ben Kingsley) gets the hots for an attractive student named Consuela (the wonderful Penelope Cruz), that the movie is elevated way above average and a masterpiece is created. Another gorgeous movie by female director Isabel Coixet, who (in 2003) gave us the unforgettable movie My Life Without Me, which is similar to our movie.\n\nI adore your wonderful breasts\n\n\"I adore your breasts, they are one of the most beautiful things my eyes have ever seen,\" an aged but still energetic David Kepesh says. He is somewhat like Humbert Humbert who falls head over heels in love for the first time in his life. He feels emotional attraction for the first time in his life. In the past it was always about physical attraction. It is true that she is thirty years younger than him, but she is intelligent enough to charm him. She becomes his muse and life partner. He is willing to forget about his many other women, including his constant mistress Carolyn (Patricia Clarkson), for her. \"Don't be crazy, mate, use her just for sex, love isn't for you\" his best friend George O'Hearn (Dennis Hopper) explains to him. George has a wife to talk to and mistresses for sex. But our professor is truly in love. He might even be obsessed and smitten like a teenager, like a young man who has fallen in love with his teacher and not his student. She is his Lolita.\n\nHot and daring sexual scenes\n\nIt is true that the daring scenes of their sex and foreplay are a bit awkward because of the age difference between Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz, but they still manage to create a very natural, interesting and passionate relationship which is believable and which could happen in exactly the same way in real life as well. Then we are faced with a reversal of fortune, which turns the erotica into an elegy, into a really sad story which will break your heart in the scene where professor Kepesh takes his camera in his hands and takes one last photograph of his muse. It is so powerful that you will have a hard time pulling yourself together. The scene is beautiful, charming, romantic, erotic and elegant, but still so sad that you will start crying. You will feel the suffering and destiny of the lovers who want a romantic comedy but get an elegy that would make even a stone cry. This is a first-class masterpiece, another My Life Without Me, a movie which was obviously too perfect to get any real distribution.\n\nSurprising nudity\n\nThe fact that Penelope Cruz takes her clothes off really isn't all that surprising because she has done this several times already, like in the movie Jamon Jamon and in other movies where the plot is concerned with love and men. It is more surprising that the actress Patricia Clarkson also takes her clothes off. The almost fifty year-old mistress of dramatisation and character acting had never done this before. This is the same as if Meryl Streep took her clothes off. Patricia not only took her clothes off, but she had sexual relations and surrendered to carnal pleasure without shame. But she doesn't do this to shock and provoke the viewers, she does it because of the story and the movie which incorporates nudity and sexuality into the action very naturally and convincingly, which means that we believe everything we see."}

{"text":"THE BEST OF YOUTH Directed by Marco Tullio Giordana\nIn Italian with English subtitles\nMiramax Films\nFilm Forum\n\nCourtesy: Miramax Films.\n\nAlessio Boni (l.) plays Matteo Carati, who serves in the military and then becomes a policeman, shown here with Luigi Lo Cascio as Nicola Carati, his free-spirited brother who becomes a successful psychiatrist.\n\n\"The Best of Youth\" is made in the spirit of its hero, a liberal psychiatrist who fights for the rights of the mentally ill and betrays his partner when she becomes a terrorist.\n\nModeration is generally a virtue in life, but it's rarely reflected in great art. There's nothing terribly wrong with \"The Best of Youth,\" but there's nothing particularly compelling about it either.\n\nPerhaps it's unfair to compare current Italian cinema with its ancestors, but \"The Best of Youth\" undeniably echoes Luchino Visconti's 1960 \"Rocco and His Brothers.\" The contrast isn't flattering. Director Marco Tullio Giordana's prosaic storytelling and flat images are no match for Visconti's combination of neo-realist grit and operatic brio.\n\nBeginning in 1966 and continuing through 2003, the year it was made, \"The Best of Youth\" follows the history of Italy through the lives of one family. Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo Carati (Alessio Boni) are teenage brothers who share similar interests. Their paths diverge after they meet a mentally ill girl and help her escape from a hospital. Nicola temporarily drops out of school, travels around Norway and then becomes a psychiatrist. Matteo joins the army and enters the police force when discharged.\n\nThe youngest member of the family, Francesca (Valentina Carnelutti), marries Nicola's friend Carlo (Fabrizio Gifuni). Due to his position at the Bank of Italy, Carlo becomes a target for terrorists. Unbeknownst to him, he's very close to one. Nicola's girlfriend Giulia (Sonia Bergamasco) is a member of the Red Brigades, a violent, left-wing organization. As the narrative progresses, it incorporates real events\u2013\u2013a massive flood in Florence, anti-Mafia campaigns in Sicily, Italian soccer victories.\n\nMade as a mini-series for Italian TV, \"The Best of Youth\" became a film when it was rejected for broadcast by the RAI channel but accepted by Cannes in 2003. However, it may not have benefited from a transfer to the big screen.\n\nApparently unintentionally, the 16mm cinematography looks drab and ragged. Watching a six-hour film in the theater\u2014Film Forum is showing it in two parts, with separate admission\u2014places more demands on an audience than watching it on TV. HBO, for example, chose not to distribute Mike Nichols' lengthy \"Angels in America\" adaptation theatrically, unlike some of their other recent productions. For most people, a work this long would have to be a masterpiece to justify such concentration. \"The Best of Youth\" is not one.\n\nIt often feels like a soap opera, although Giordana was obviously aiming for an allegorical panorama akin to Salman Rushdie's novel \"Midnight's Children.\" The film manages to avoid baby-boomer narcissism and reducing the 1960s and 1970s to sex, drugs and rock-n-roll. Despite opening with a song by the Animals, it doesn't overload the sound track with golden oldies or define the era through music. Even the costume design, makeup and hairstyles are relatively subtle.\n\nDespite the length, \"The Best of Youth\" starts off well-paced. It has a few remarkable sequences\u2013\u2013the wedding that closes the first part and a lengthy section set on New Year's Eve, 1982, which cuts back and forth between a party and Matteo alone, caught up in depression.\n\nLo Cascio and Boni both give splendid performances. It's heartrending to see Matteo gradually become colder and angrier. Boni never pushes his actions into outright pathology, but the character loses self-control all the same. Seemingly defeated, he pours his heart into work, screaming at spectators who gaze at a dead body as if they were watching a film. His breakdown is all the more horrible because it doesn't seem to have any clear cause.\n\nNicola is a more likable character, but there's always something childlike about him. He really enjoys working with children and the mentally ill because he loves play. His idealism fades with age, but some traces remain with him until the end.\n\nAfter the New Year's Eve party, \"The Best of Youth\" descends into a digressive, aimless final quarter, which shows the younger members of the Carati clan growing up rapidly. The film peaks early. The original structure, in which it would be shown in four 90-minute sections, might work better than the current one, especially since the original break points are very obvious. The ending, which aims to link the family's grandchildren to Nicola's 1960s adventures, misfires by imposing a cyclical conclusion on a linear story.\n\n\"The Best of Youth\" comes with a long list of literary and cinematic precursors. In addition to \"Rocco and His Brothers,\" it's reminiscent of Edgar Reitz's 25-hour mini-series \"The Second Heimat,\" an exploration of youth in 1960s Germany. Like \"The Best of Youth,\" \"The Second Heimat\" shies away from received wisdom about the period. Unlike it, Reitz's film really does have enough length and depth to rival an epic novel.\n\nIt's surprising that Miramax picked up \"The Best of Youth.\" Their favorite European films tend to be middlebrow Oscar-bait like \"Amelie\" and \"Life Is Beautiful.\" It's less surprising that they owned the rights for 18 months before releasing it.\n\nIf this film represents the best contemporary Italian cinema, the nation has fallen a long way off since the debuts of Pier Paolo Pasolini, Marco Bellocchio and Bernardo Bertolucci in the early 1960s. While European TV has produced many fine films, \"The Best of Youth\" would have been better left for the small screen."}
{"text":"'The Master' is a mixed bag of good and bad\n\nCampus Correspondent\n\nPublished: Monday, October 1, 2012\n\nUpdated: Monday, October 1, 2012 22:10\n\nWhen the credits begin to roll in the movie theater, people always turn to whoever they came with and say something simple like \"that was so good\" or \"that was so bad\" or even sometimes \"what the hell was that?\" When \"The Master\" ended I sat there in a state of awe and shock, unable to find any words to explain my two-and-a-half hour experience. This may sound like a good thing, but \"The Master\" left me in silent awe because I was so unsure of what I had just seen that whether or not I liked it wasn't even relevant. In one sentence, \"The Master\" is about so many things that it kind of goes right over its own head as well as the audience's.\n\nThere were two things I did manage to take away from the film. Firstly, Joaquin Phoenix and Philip-Seymour Hoffman will win Oscars. Joaquin Phoenix is so creepy as a lonely insane drifter. Philip-Seymour Hoffman does a phenomenal job imitating the founder of Scientology, and the chemistry between the two is strong. Both do such great jobs that they really make the film interesting all on their own, and I say that because that's all that really moves the film along. Second, Amy Adams will at least be nominated. Adams does a great job as always. She plays Hoffman's wife. While she doesn't manage to steal the stage as she usually does, when Phoenix and Hoffman aren't around she reminds us why we've all come to love her so much. She is really creepy at times!\nPaul Thomas Anderson's previous films \"Boogie Nights\" and \"Magnolia\" are constantly referred to as two of the best films ever made. He seems to have lost his touch in \"The Master.\" While the acting is outstanding, there isn't a plot or much of anything to go along with it. There isn't a single likeable character. Freddy is supposed to be our hero, but he's literally insane. The film states this. Anderson has said that this film is about the effect of war on soldiers mostly, rather than Scientology, but we never see or hear about what sort of things happened to him in the war and it's never brought up. What we do learn is that Freddy's mother was insane and institutionalized, he's been drinking paint thinner for years, he's addicted to sex and is a violent pathological liar. It's implied he was like that before the war. So the war effects argument doesn't add up. What we do see is this religion that mirrors Scientology being constantly questioned and criticized. At one point the founder's son even says, \"He's making it all up.\" We see that Freddy never believes the religion and just sticks around because he is lonely and hates his life the same way the others in the church who weren't raised into it are. So this film is basically about debunking Scientology and showing what kind of people the director believes are attracted to it.\n\nAll in all, the film is an interesting look at Scientology, but I don't know enough about the subject to say how truthful it is to the real-life people behind Scientology and to the church itself. It tries to be about a lot of other stuff too, but fails to develop any of it. You probably won't like a single character or understand their motives, and the last five minutes shouldn't have even been there. It is so well done and acted that I can't say it's a bad movie, but it's certainly no \"Boogie Nights\" or \"Magnolia\" that we'll be talking about after Oscar season."}
{"text":"There are many books that make themselves clear right from the first page. You know that whatever is going to follow will have you hooked. This defines Memoirs of a Geisha perfectly. It has all the necessary elements that accompany its reader pleasantly while it offers a cultural adventure into one of the most intriguing stories: the life of a geisha.\n\nThe book was published in 1997 and became a world-wide best seller in no time; written by the American novelist Arthur Golden \u2013 a specialist in Japanese history and culture. Memoirs of a Geisha narrates the story of a geisha named Sayuri, following a timeline structure. It's written in the first person and the whole story takes place in Japan before and after the Second World War.\n\nIn order to make it work, the writer follows a lot of clich\u00e9s regarding the structure and the development of the story. However, it's a book that stands out thanks to the fact that the reader gets a deep insight into some of the most interesting and sacred rituals involved within the geishas' community. The book provides a detailed description of what it means being a geisha: an artist, a happy and pleasant companionship and at times a mistress. I think that's what the author accomplishes best, clarifying to the western world what a geisha really is and how difficult it is to become one.\n\nAfter its huge success, there was no doubt that getting it adapted into a movie would be a clever move. In 2005 the movie was released, directed by Rob Marshall and written by Robin Swicord, Memoirs of a Geisha was greeted with huge success. The audience loved it and the critics praised it. It managed to get 3 Oscar awards (of the 6 which it was nominated for).\n\nAs an adaptation, it had the usual casualties in order to flow and fit into 145 minutes. Many things were omitted or alternated but the basic story was there and the characters followed the book's guidelines. The most beautiful Asian actresses were cast to participate, arising debates whether or not it would be appropriate to have the main female roles being played by Chinese actresses. Li Gong, Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang played their roles beautifully, convincing the audience as geishas thanks to their grace and elegance. On the downside, the movie failed to fully explore the importance of ceremonials and the strictness of following specific rituals. Nevertheless, the protagonist in the film was the scenery and photography that managed to create a perfect background. The high aesthetics of the film makes it worth watching more than once"}

{"text":"It has been more than a decade since Japanese director Masayuki Suo's last film Shall We Dance?. In 2006, Suo took a different turn and decided to tackle an issue plaguing Japan year after year: gropers on public transportation. But before you think this is going to be about a female victim standing up to her male perpetrator, think agan. Suo's latest cinematic effort Soredemo Boku wa Yattenai (I Just Didn't Do It) addresses the perspective of the innocently accused. The film tries to show its audience what goes behind the Japanese court system and how one is assumed guilty until proven innocent.\n\nThe film follows a young man named Teppei Kaneko as he is wrongly accused of groping a high school girl on the train. Like in most actual cases, Teppei is advised by not only his lawyer, but the police and prosecutors as well, to admit to the crime because he doesn't stand a chance winning his case -- as pointed out by the 99% conviction rate. However, Teppei goes against the advice because well, he honestly \"just didn't do it.\" Why not? In turn, Teppei's decision to prove his innocence shows that it is going to be one long hellish journey for him.\n\nSuo's inspiration for this film came from a story he heard in the news about a young man who was wrongfully accused of being a train groper. After five years, he was acquitted from the crime in the Japanese high courts. Soredemo doesn't just settle with telling a story of one victim; it's trying to illicit some sort of lasting emotion from the audience and to develop a growing awareness to look more carefully at what really goes on in civil court cases. An independent study done by J. Mark Ramseyer and Eric B. Rasmusen claims that the conviction rate is high due to the lack of prosecutors that are taking on all of these cases. Tougher sentences have just recently been brought on to train-gropers.\n\nFor a film of that's based on a very controversial topic, you might expect a lot of overacting and quick transitions from scene to scene, but what happens is quite the opposite. Soredemo takes a more subtle approach \u2013- a slow, painful death that actually works really well for the film. The audience becomes more engaged with the story. Watching the film felt like you were right alongside Teppei: you get so caught up that you lose a sense of time. At the end, when you realize the amount of time that has passed for this one court case, you cannot help but feel angry along with him. The pace forces the audience to pay close attention to what is being presented on the screen.\n\nOne of the most memorable parts of the film is when Teppei and his supporters reenact the scenarios based on his memory and the accuser's statement. The scene is one of the film's comedic moments, but at the same time it's also the very point of the film that you see how well the cast works together. The film's array of characters are also pretty dynamic. They range from intimidating to quirky to downright pathetic, but it paints a vivid portrait of a community coming together to support a cause.\n\nThe standout performance is Ryo Kase (Honey and Clover, Letters from Iwo Jima) in his first starring role. He transforms Teppei from being a timid, unemployed young man to a person with the determination to prove his innocence. He skillfully develops his character in a manner that parallels so well with the pacing of the storyline. Teppei's characterization is the center of this film, and Kase does a great job in moving the audience with his performance. Kase has already picked up a number of awards and nominations for his efforts. Koji Yakusho (Babel) from Suo's last film, Shall We Dance?, also delivers a fine performance as one of the lawyers defending Teppei.\n\nIn a country where there are constant images of sex-starved males ranging from all ages, this is a refreshing change of pace. Acts of \"chikan\" (groping) is not just a crime in Japan; it's become a recurring image in Japanese popular culture as well. Japanese adult videos (AVs) often feature a teenage female high school student. There is even a gathering group for gropers alike in Tokyo, The Groper's Brotherhood, where men of various occupations (teachers, office workers, Buddhist priests) come together to discuss how to avoid trains under high surveillance, to exchange tips and to run workshops on the art of groping. In this case, it's not a mystery why 4,000 men are accused annually of being train-gropers.\n\nThere have been measures taken to fix this problem. A couple of years ago, some passenger cars in trains were designated for women only, so females were able to ride the train without any stress of worrying about being groped on a train by another man. However, this created some controversy, as young boys were not allowed on the same train as their mothers. Men have also protested this solution as it painted all Japanese men as train-gropers.\n\nIn the end, Soredemo goes against the preconceived notions that Japanese men are distrustful, engaging the audience in a more moving story that makes them think. Suo is asking the audience to take a thoughtful look at the core issues of the film, and he plans on making more films relating to this issue in the future."}

The film is a funny cross between this year?s Lonesome Jim (C-), Gus Van Sant's Last Days (C), and Dangerous Minds (C+); it?s about a depressed guy who mopes around and doesn?t do much, and not much happens (like Jim and Last Days), but he is also an inspiring middle school teacher to troubled black students.\n\nRyan Gosling has won raves for his portrayal of a coke addict trying to turn around, and his performance is probably pretty accurate. However, the film gets exhausting very quickly; there is a lot of lingering around in claustrophobic settings for the first half (as Gosling struggles to keep it together), which will test the patience of most. The film is very short on character development, and nothing really happens until the second hour. The film's dead pace makes it pretty depressing, and it comes off like an edgy after-school-special indie.\n\nThe film also seems confused; part of it is aimed at the Requiem for a Dream (B+) crowd, while it also has elements of Akeelah and the Bee (B-). Half Nelson is partly about cultures colliding, or opposites colliding, and perhaps part of the film?s charm is that it plays with genre opposites. That connection is impressive, but this story still needed a lot of work. Half Nelson is a kind of independent breed that I tend to really dislike: it?s an ultimate performer?s piece (for an actor), but the story (or character study) ultimately doesn?t say much."}

Truly making a splash as one of the French punks in 1995's la haine (Hate), Cassel has gone on to play the criminal mastermind of Dobermann, the supernaturally psychotic aristocrat of Brotherhood of the Wolf, the pimp who ruins Clive Owens's life in Derailed, as well as a limber cat burglar who twisted through the last two Oceans movies. And that's just the tip of the twisted iceberg that Cassel plays like few actors anywhere in the business.\n\nIf Cassel's rogues gallery has often caked cinema screens with blood, then it's likely connoisseurs will notice the acting talent that runs with it. As the son of legendary French performer Jean-Pierre Cassel (The Three Musketeers) and husband to Monica Bellucci, it's not as if Cassel hasn't been able to play men of some principle as The Crimson Rivers' cop and the distraught boyfriend of Irreversible (with his character avenging Bellucci's). But somehow it's the humane energy that Cassel puts into his most popular, immoral bent that makes evil acts understandable if somehow even likable, even when he's about to kill a baby as the pathetic crime heir of Eastern Promises. For Cassel is the kind of bad guy whose magnetism always puts audiences under his wild-eyed command.\n\nMuch of the same can be said for the real-life super villain Jacques Mesrine, a master escape artist, robber, and likely killer. Yet his panache made the thousands of people he'd likely victimize into his number-one fans. Now the stranger-than-fiction escapades of Mesrine provide Vincent Cassel with his ultimate bad-guy role. Over the course of two riveting films, Cassel gets to indulge in alternately humorous and horrifying acts that make our Scarface seem like a piker as Mesrine rises to public enemy number one. It's a cavalcade of kidnappings, beatings, awful prison stints, and animal attraction that Cassel gets to make mincemeat of. But make no mistake that his performance resembles any cartoon crime lord. In Cassel's capable hands, Jacques Mesrine is very much human, alternately likable and terrifying in his rush to become France's answer to John Dillinger \u2014 an amazing performance that truly puts Vincent Cassel at the top of the criminal world.\n\nDaniel Schweiger: They say that an actor has to truly empathize with the characters they play. Given the number of villainous people you portray so well, how much do you love Jacques Mesrine, and how much do you hate him?\n\nVincent Cassel: While I always need to understand my character, I'm not the kind of character who needs to like him or hate him, so there's no passion from me toward Mesrine, but I am very interested in the contradictions he provokes. Many times, when we were shooting, I would turn back to the director and say, \"We're going to lose the audience because what this guy is doing right now is awful.\" But the deal was to recreate the magic that happened in Mesrine's lifetime, and even though this guy did all those terrible things, people still like him. So the deal from the start was not to hide anything. Yes, we're going to keep Mesrine a racist. Yes, we're going to keep him violent with women. Yes, we're going to keep him killing people. But eventually, people might still root for him. And that's Mesrine's \"magic.\"\n\nDS: Mesrine starts out like Scarface's Tony Montana, in a way \u2014 a criminal with a moral code about whom he maims or kills, but that line gets crossed with the audience very quickly, which makes it even more troubling when we end up rooting for Mesrine to escape the cops. What was it that shocked you the most about Mesrine's actions?\n\nVC: It's in the second film, when he tortures a journalist. The guy was a real extreme right-winger. He was terrible. A scumbag. But he didn't deserve what Mesrine did to him. Mesrine's accomplice even took us to the cave where it happened and gave us all the details. But somehow the reporter lived through it all, and when they accused Mesrine of trying to kill him, he said, \"No I didn't try to kill him or he'd be dead.\" He probably survived because Mesrine couldn't aim properly. His friend said, \"I had to keep the reporter down with my foot with each and every bullet because he moved so much!\" That's the truth, and it was scary to hear that. I just wanted to get rid of that scene and move on.\n\nDS: What do you think are the biggest tonal differences between part 1 and part 2 of Mesrine?\n\nVC: The storytelling is different. Public Enemy #1 is a little more classical. Killer Instinct is more about getting into the ego of the guy, where everything becomes too much. There are a lot of jump cuts from one thing to another because it's more about the craziness of it all. So in that way, I think the second movie is more complex. I think it's also more depressing because the first one is the rise of the guy, which is pretty inspiring in terms of energy. Then, in the second one, the guy goes crazy so he goes down, down, down until his death. That makes it a little pathetic, a little sadder.\n\nDS: Do you think there's something specifically \"French\" about Mesrine? Or do you think there's kind of a universal \"language\" that master criminals like him, John Dillinger, and Pablo Escobar speak?\n\nVC: Having played bad guys on a regular basis, I'm approached by people who are like them in real life \u2014 big dealers \u2014 and I realize that they love to be portrayed in cinema. I've talked to bank robbers who identify with Scarface. He might not exist, but they want to be him. It's like they recognize themselves in him.\n\nDS: When we meet Mesrine in Algeria, he's already doing some horrendous stuff under order of the French army. In that way, do you think Mesrine is a government-made killer who really isn't to be blamed for what he was shaped into?\n\nVC: I think it maybe was justification that he found for his actions. Jacques Mesrine had a problem with authority. Doing these movies, I've discovered that people like my father, who came from the same generation as Mesrine, were ashamed of their parents because they lost the second World War. So when the war in Algeria happened, they were all willing to go there to wash the honor of the previous generation. It's a very strange psychological mechanism.\n\nDS: Do you think criminals like Mesrine want to be movie stars when it all comes down to it?\n\nVC: I think that when you're a real tough guy, you're not making movies. You have something else to do, yet I think they would still like to have the recognition and all the glam of so-called celebrity. But you don't get the same adrenaline because there's no real danger in acting. Yeah, you can fuck up your career eventually, but that's the worst thing that can happen to you. When researching my characters, these robbers would tell me crazy things for advise, like what happens when you go for a heist. Your heart's pumping because you have no time. You have to hit the guy, and he has to feel you all the time until you're out of the bank. \"Gun in the face! Gun in the face! Don't let him think for one second.\"\n\nDS: They had actually made a Mesrine film back in 1984.\n\nVC: Yeah, but it was really bad. I think you can see bits and pieces of it on YouTube. It was made for no money. It was very stiff. Plus, it was too fresh. There were a lot of things that are portrayed in that movie that people couldn't really tell the truth about at the time. The trial concerning Mesrine's death ended like a month before we started shooting \u2014 30 years later!\n\nDS: What do you think really happened?\n\nVC: I think the guy got too loud. The government felt like fools at the time. They just decided to terminate Mesrine, even though they never called it that. In '78, one year before he died, Mesrine was the favorite celebrity of the French people. Everybody was looking for him, and he still managed to give an interview threatening the government. It was a cover story which showed Mesrine with a machine gun and hand grenades. At that point, the government just said, \"Enough. Stop everything you're doing right now and concentrate on finding him. We want to get rid of this guy.\" So Mesrine died because he was too loud. Even today, there hasn't been one murder that Mesrine has been accused of committing where he's been proven to have been the actual killer. So we don't even know that Mesrine truly killed anyone.\n\nDS: One of the best scenes in the two Mesrine films is in part one, where he goes mad in ultra-solitary confinement. I can imagine it's one thing to psych yourself up to play the tough guy, but it's another to be absolutely convincing as someone who's gone mad because of prison torture. What was it like shooting those scenes for you?\n\nVC: A lot of people are telling me about how harsh that scene is, but it wasn't the roughest thing to play because it's all fake, really. The water was kind of warm, and the things they were hitting me with were soft, so it's all about the choreography and the acting really. I didn't suffer that day.\n\nDS: You certainly made me believe it.\n\nVC: It works. That's what it's all about. It wasn't the roughest thing really. Actually, I think the roughest thing in Mesrine for me to play was when I had to torture that reporter. It was a very strange day because I felt like Mesrine's accomplice was truly excited by what he was showing us. He was excited by the revival of that moment. I just wanted to shoot that scene and go.\n\nDS: One of the first movies I truly noticed your criminal talents in was 1997's Dobermann. It's an incredible, ultra-violent crime film that has yet to be released in this country.\n\nVC: I know. Miramax bought it and kept it in a locker room forever. Dobermann was pretty new for the French cinema at the time. We were killed by the press. They called us fascists. They called our director, Jan Kounen, a \"Mussolini-an\" director, whatever that means, but I guess when people get crazy about a movie, they start to use that terminology. But it also means that they've been touched by it, one way or another. If there's a movie I've done that Mesrine also reminds me of, it's Read My Lips. I think Mesrine is a mix of Dobermann and Read My Lips a bit because it has the craziness and graphic violence of Dobermann but in a less cartoonish way, and Mesrine also has the texture and truthfulness that Read My Lips had.\n\nDS: For me, your true talent at playing so many great bad guys is how you invest even the worst of them with a real humanity, especially as Kirill in Eastern Promises, even when he's about to drown a baby.\n\nVC: If I've got a good guy to play, I'll find the dirt in him. And if it's a bad guy, I need to find the bright side to him. I think it's that \"bright\" side that makes the villains more \"real\" on screen than the good guys. The truth is that we all do terrible things. Maybe not to that level, of course, because most of us don't kill or rob banks, yet we all have skeletons in our closets. We cheat, we lie, and we can be cowards. But if you want to play a hero, you can't really use those things. When you play a bad guy, you have to use those things. So all together, I think bad guys are closer to reality. They're more human to me, most of the time.\n\nDS: I read that they're going to be doing a sequel to Eastern Promises. Would Kirill be back for it?\n\nVC: Definitely.\n\nDS: What's happened to him since?\n\nVC: I'm not going to tell you, but the idea is to make a sequel that would be shot in Russia using the same crew. I'm dying to do it because I really like the character \u2014 the complexity of him being a hidden gay person. Hopefully the film is going to go. It's not quite sure yet, but I know David Cronenberg wants to do it, and I think Viggo Mortensen is interested, so hopefully it's going to happen.\n\nDS: Another one of my favorite villain parts you've done is playing Jean-Francois in Christophe Gans' Brotherhood of the Wolf. Now you're set to be in his Fantomas, who is a famed French super-villain.\n\nVC: Fantomas is going to be a huge movie in terms of budget. It's going to be around 60 million Euros, if not more, and we're going to shoot it in 3D. It's a superhero movie, except that they are all super-villains and their battlefield is the world. So that's the idea of it.\n\nDS: Like Despicable Me?\n\nVC: Kind of, except it's not a cartoon, but it will involve a lot of high technology and CGI. Fantomas was the master of disguise, but because this is more futuristic, we'll use some kind of holograms and I will use other actors' personas. I will be dressed with CGI and I will look like other actors, but it will always be \"me.\"\n\nDS: You and your wife, Monica Bellucci, are essentially the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie of France. In a way, do you think it's easier to be that kind of superstar couple in France than in Hollywood?\n\nVC: Definitely, but we're not as known as them so it's a different scale and it's a little more normal, I guess. Here, that kind of celebrity culture comes to an extent that is really insane. People started to think it's normal, and that's the worst part of it, I guess. In Italy, they can also be stupid like that. But in France, I think we still have some kind of dignity about it. You can still sue people if they take pictures of you.\n\nDS: What does it take to be the go-to Euro villain of Hollywood?\n\nVC: First of all, I don't really feel like that, but I don't mind. I started with la haine, where I wasn't a good guy. Then came Dobermann and Irreversible, so it's not like I have to make an effort to play bad guys. It's something I like. I say \"bad guys\" so people understand me, but to me, they are not bad. They're just complex.\n\nMusic Box Films' 'Mesrine: Public Enemy #1' is released on September 3, 2010."}
{"text":"FILMINK rates movies out of $20 - the score indicates the amount we believe a ticket to the movie to be worth\n\nThis quirky film feels slightly tired at its core and follows a group of self-involved, but largely uninteresting, characters.\n\nThis rather unwieldy story revolves around a number of denizens of a Manhattan apartment block and their visitors. Some are pleasant and some are horrible. The central character - if there is one - is Kate (Catherine Keener in typically good form), who runs an upmarket vintage furniture and home accessories store with her husband, Alex (Oliver Platt). As he bluntly puts it, they \"buy from the children of dead people.\" The liberal and conscionable Kate agonises about her ethical shortcomings, sometimes compounding them in the process. This makes for a few wryly amusing and embarrassing vignettes, such as when she thinks that a black man waiting for a table must be a homeless person...and offers him food.\n\nKate and Alex have a brattish teenage daughter (Sarah Steele), and they've bought another flat in the building from an abrasive and unrelievedly negative old woman called Andra (Ann Morgan Guilbert), who gets to stay in the apartment until she dies. If that's starting to seem a tad top-heavy, we also have to factor in Andra's granddaughters. Rebecca (Rebecca Hall) is a radiographer's assistant; she's lonely but nice as pie, and visits the old lady regularly. Her sister, Mary (Amanda Peet), a spa worker specialising in facials, is unbelievably rude and bitchy.\n\nIt's all a bit quirky and tiresome, but improves (slightly) as it goes on. Not very much of any significance happens in Please Give, and what does isn't entirely plausible. The main problem with the film, though, is that it seems to assume that self-obsessed and charmless people are automatically interesting - just for being people. There's definitely a flaw in that logic."}
{"text":"How does a martial arts extravaganza starring Josh Hartnett, Demi Moore, and Woody Harrelson end up on home video with less fanfare than Michelle Duggar announcing she's getting ready to pop out her 39th reality TV star? Bunraku made waves at Fantastic Fest last year for its mix of Asian-influenced cinematography and action, American actors and completely balls-out storytelling. It's now available for rental at your local video store and, though the movie's charms wear out considerably fast, this is still a rather unique gem that's completely worth your time.\n\nBunraku is a form of Japanese theater, featuring puppets, and director Guy Moshe infuses his movie with this visual style. Sets are fancifully theatrical, with a lot of the sets looking like higher-end cardboard cutouts. Characters wear fanciful clothing in bright primary colors, the better to stand out against the movie's intentionally theater-looking backgrounds.\n\nOr he could just be a pimp.\n\nBunraku's tale occurs in the aftermath of a global war, resulting in the outlawing of all firearms and things that go boom. Luckily, human beings have been kicking the ever-loving fecal stuff out of each other for thousands of years without all of that namby-pamby gun crap. Cue outrageous martial arts sequences\u2026 well, as outrageous as you can get when your movie stars Josh Hartnett rather than Jet Li. Still, editing and camera tricks more than make up for the cast's general lack of actual martial arts prowess.\n\nHartnett plays Drifter, and, yes, this is the kind of movie where characters are named according to their function in the story, giving Bunraku an almost Sergio Leone feel to the inevitable conflict between the various Men-With-No-Names. Drifter wants to kill Nicola The Woodcutter (Ron Perlman), who appears to have won the character naming lottery with both an actual name and a function. To ponder the reason behind their animosity is to completely miss the point of this sort of movie. Drifter and Woodcutter must fight until one of them lies dead because their destiny requires them to.\n\nPersonally, I'd settle for giving him a haircut.\n\nAlong for the ride is multi-talented Japanese singer-songwriter-actor-voice-actor-author Gackt who plays Yoshi, a swordsman also seeking revenge against the ever-popular Woodcutter. The movie also throws in Woody Harrelson's Bartender. Bartender serves as the movie's source of knowledge, advice and general how-to, and Harrelson gives the role his best Wise Sage swagger. Demi Moore, still looking smoking hot and not a day over 35, shows up as Woodcutter's captive lover and Kevin McKidd, of Dog Soldiers fame, rounds out the cast as the villain's second in command, appropriately named Killer #2.\n\nBunraku follows the general plot direction of most revenge-driven flicks. To put it in video game terms, Drifter needs to overcome ever-increasing waves of bad guys, not to mention defeat a few mini bosses, before finally passing through the end-boss doors to confront Woodcutter. Bunraku is a movie that lives or dies based on its visuals, not its storytelling, which is as old as the art of making movies itself.\n\nOverall, Bunraku is a splendid movie to gaze at and drink in. It's saturated with bright, vibrant colors and although there's a certain disconnect between the actors and the cartoon-looking backgrounds, the end result is endlessly fun to watch, even if the sets end up looking like those of a high school production of Kill Bill.\n\nLittle Timmy's school play was going fine until Josh Hartnett started knocking kids out.\n\nUltimately, Bunraku is a spectacular experiment in tone, style and costuming that ends up being worthwhile viewing. Come for the unique tone or the constant fights, either way you will be entertained. Whether or not you revisit the movie at a later occasion is entirely up in the air. It's not an instant classic, but director Guy Moshe certainly takes a big step into a larger arena with this movie. I'll be first in line for his next opus.\n\nYour faithful reviewer,\nTheMatt.\n\nJust TheMatt. It's my name and my function. God said \"Let There Be Reviews!\" And TheMatt was. And it was good. Then God completely forgot about his creation and left it to bake in the oven overnight. Which explains the not entirely unappealing insanity and general lack of logical thought processes. Or any higher thought processes at all. BUNRAKU!"}
{"text":"Monsieur Ibrahim\n\nRate this movie:\n\nYou must sign-in first.\n\nCurrent Rating 9.89\/10 | 9 Votes\n\nMonsieur Ibrahim (and the Flowers of the Koran), based on the play by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, explores the inter-ethnic friendship between two unlikely persons. What is unique about this friendship is not only is one of them a Jew and the other a Muslim - and they generally do not like each other - but the wide age-gap between the two. The Jew is a teenager and the Muslim is at least in his 60's. Under ordinary American-based circumstances, such a friendship is unthinkable - the old man would be in jail on account of the teen's age. But this is 1960's Paris, France. If a woman can go topless in public, a friendship between a Jewish teen and a Muslim senior citizen is certainly permitted.\n\nWe first meet Moise (Pierre Boulanger), a nice-looking Jewish boy who lives with his divorced father. He is mature for his age, very responsible, and takes care of the house. Like most boys, he has an excited libido and invests a lot of his money on the hookers that work right outside of where he lives (yes, he is underaged but that never stops him, or them). His father is of the opposite temperament. He is dissatisfied with everything in his life and wishes Moise could be more like his older brother who is everything Moise is not - perfect - clearly an unhappy man whose condition only becomes worse to the point that he abandons Moise.\n\nMoise frequents the grocery store across the street from where he lives. Its owner is Ibrahim (Omar Sharif), whom as Moise discovers is not Arab but Muslim. Underneath the unkempt appearance, Ibrahim ia an intelligent, intuitive sage brimming with wisdom. The only information about his personal life that is known is that he was once married but it is presumed, though he never made clear, that his wife has passed on. Though advanced in years, Ibrahim is mentally sharp. He knows when Moise, whom he calls \"Momo\", is swiping items from his store, how to treat a celebrity in town for a movie shoot, and where to go to legalize his adoption of Momo as his foster son. The friendship between Momo's and Ibrahim goes into full swing after the departure of Momo's father. Both of them embark on a road trip to Turkey in Ibrahim's brand new car.\n\nAs the wise but kind Ibrahim, Sharif is dignified without being pretentious. His lines, many of which are akin to quotes from Proverbs, are delivered with non-pompous humble casualness that reflect an inner spirit that humbly personify them. Boulanger is charming and terrific to watch. His juvenile demeanor is a retaining quality throughout all of his scenes. The only complaint about the casting is the actor playing the adult Momo, Eric Caravaca. For some reason, he does not have the same magnetic presence as Boulanger, nor does his portrayal of Momo bears any marks of someone who had an unforgettable life-changing experience as a teen.\n\nA few things make Monsieur Ibrahim a fun movie to watch. One, it is the presence of hookers. Love them or hate them, their appearance usually mean a generous amount of gratuitous sex to follow, and they do not disappoint. Two, the pranks that Momo plays on his father by serving him dinner made from pet food are priceless. Three, the use of pre-60's style R&B music not only to set the timeframe of the story but also to convey Momo's feelings. A brassy instrumental track frequently repeats itself to emphasize Momo's good mood and upbeat disposition.\n\nMost important of all is how director Francois Dupeyron tells the story. It is already given that Momo is Jewish and Ibrahim is Muslim, so Dupeyron does not need to dwell on that. Instead, he delves into their characters beneath the ethnic labels and brings out inner emotions that everyone can relate to: need for friendship and father figure, abandonment, loss of a loved one, life-changing experiences, and the travails of being a teen (in Momo's case) and an old man (in Ibrahim's case). Regardless of one's race or culture, the themes are easily accessible."}
{"text":"call \"Enemy at the Gates\" a German movie, but it\ncould easily be an American or British film. The movie stars English speakers\nin Russian roles, and Ed Harris, a distinctively American actor, as a German\nMajor. In\nan aesthetic choice, the actors all speak English regardless of their\ncharacter's nationality. Because this seems to be the case throughout the movie,\nthe effect is not as jarring, and easily accepted and soon becomes a nonentity.\n(After all, if I have to listen to yet another foreign actor faking a\n\"Russian\" accent while speaking English... I will never understand why\npeople choose to do this, because the whole thing is absurd.)\n\n\"Enemy at the Gates\" is the second Trivial Love\nTriangle During a Major Historical Event movie that came out in 2001, the same year that saw the release of\n\"Pearl\nHarbor,\" the other Trivial Love Triangle During a Major Historical Event\nmovie. Both films, in fact, are so similar that it's\nimpossible not to lump them together, even if one were to forget that both are\nTrivial Love Triangle During a Major Historical Event movies. Both films involve a love triangle consisting of 2 men and one woman;\nboth are set during World War II; both ends with 1\/3rd of the love\ntriangle conveniently killed off so the other 2\/3rd of the triangle\ncan live happily ever after. And, besides all that, both have love triangles that brings nothing to\nthe movie except to pad the running time and in an effort to draw the hopeless\nromantics sector of the moviegoing public. Or perhaps I'm just being too cynical\nand the film really did have a reason to include a futile love triangle...?\n\n\"Enemy at the Gates\" stars Jude Law as a Russian farm boy who joins\nthe army at a time when the Germans are about to break through the city of\nStalingrad, Russia's greatest city. The fall of Stalingrad would mark the\ndestruction of Russia, literally and figuratively, and the Russian brass,\ncontrolled by Nikita Khrushchev (he of \"We will bury you!\" fame), is\ndetermined to not let that happen.\n\nIn an effort to stop the German juggernaut,\nthe Russian brass is sending wave after wave of weaponless farm boys to die at\nthe front lines. If the Russian soldiers, half of whom have no weapons with\nwhich to fight, flee the battlefield, they are shot down by their own people. So\neither way, they are lamb to the slaughter, and their slaughter is shown in\nhorrific detail by Annaud. It's a terrible fight, a losing fight, and everyone\nknows it, but no one is willing to accept it, most of all Khrushchev and his\npeople.\n\nThen one day, during another hopeless battle, Jude Law\n(\"Road to\nPerdition\") distinguishes\nhimself as a marksman by (finally) getting his hands on a rifle and\nsingle-handedly killing 5 German officers. Luckily for Jude, a Russian public\nrelations officer played by Joseph Fiennes (\"Killing\nMe Softly\") is there to record it. By the time\nJude, as Vassili, returns to the barracks, he's become a legend. Vassili's\nlegend grows with each sniping run into German lines, and soon the Russian army\nis hailing him as a hero, and stories about his killings are giving the Russian\nsoldiers renewed spirits, while at the same time scaring the Germans.\n\nIn an effort to stop the dangerous Vassili, the Germans send for their\nown master sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig has a back story of\nhis own, and has come to fight with Vassili seemingly not for his country, but\non a personal death wish brought on by the death of his own son, lost elsewhere\nin the war. Koenig is a\nstoic, brooding figure, and is the crafty veteran to Jude Law's brash Vassili.\n\nNow, if co-writer\/director Annaud (\"The\nLover\") had stuck to the above\ndescription as the whole movie, \"Enemy at the Gates\" would be a stellar\nfilm. Instead, Annaud, falling into the same pit of misery that\nbefell \"Pearl Harbor,\"\nunnecessarily burdens us with an uninspired (and dare I say it, unconvincing) love triangle between Rachel Weisz as a\nRussian Jew, Vassili, and Fiennes' Danilov.\n\nThe movie is most effective when it concentrates on Vassili\nand his hunts through the bombed-out city of Stalingrad. Annaud frames the city\nin stark colors, giving us an effective view of Stalingrad as a city\nunder siege. As Vassili and his team of snipers burrow and crawl and climb their\nway across the city's bomb-marked landscape, the movie is at its most intense. It's only when Fiennes and the silly love triangle enter the\npicture that the movie bogs down into standard, recognizable mush.\n\nThere is a plot point near the end when Danilov realizes that Weisz has given her\nheart and body to Law's character, and feeling betrayed, decides to fight back by spreading\nuntrue propaganda about Vassili to the Russian brass. This is shown, but\nthere is no resolution to it. Did the brass receive Danilov's propaganda? Did\nthey buy it? Were there any repercussions against Vassili? Nothing is ever\nmentioned about this betrayal again. Why bring it up in the first place? As a\nmatter of fact, why introduce a love triangle in the first place?"}
{"text":"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\n\nI'm used to Jim Carrey playing in funny, slightly silly, movies. So it was surprising to see him in something so serious and dramatic. Though surprising in a good way. Released in 2004 and directed by Michel Gondry, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was nominated for, and eventually won, an Oscar. It went on to be nominated for another 50 awards, 38 of which it won. Clementine and Joel have been together for a long time and like any couple they've had their share of ups and downs. However, the downs outnumber the ups, and Clementine finally gets fed up with their shaky relationship enough that she decides to get all of the memories of their time together erased. Joel isn't exactly thrilled about loving a woman who literally wants nothing to do with him so he begins to undergo the same procedure. Only, it's as Clementine is being erased from his memories that he discovers that he loves her more than he thought he had and in a bid to keep her around his mind starts inserting her in other parts of Joel's psyche that she originally had no place in. Starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, the film is quirky and wild, but it's also a lot of fun to watch and it's easy to see how it managed to win so many awards."}

{"text":"Foreign films are cool. Because they're foreign, and they speak foreign languages, and they have plots you'd never see in America, like Bullhead, about a steroid-fueled cattle farmer named Jacky Vanmarsenille who gets involved with a criminal meat trader (those exist?) and is forced to face his tragic childhood as federal agents begin to investigate an assassination of one of their colleagues... Who comes up with this stuff?\n\nOh yeah. People like writer\/director Michael R. Roskam, who makes movies, like Bullhead, that are nominated for Academy Awards.\n\nBullhead is up for Best Foreign Language Film, and you can see why. Its premise is just kooky enough, its characters just colorful enough and its plot just sad and disturbing enough to work in ways that it has no right to.\n\nRoskam uses a somber pallet to paint the Belgium countryside as a dark, depressing place full of secrets and innocence lost. Every aspect of the movie feeds from this canvas, from its collection of colorful but tragic characters to its seedy and strange but far from wild story.\n\nMatthias Schoenarrts turns in one of the oddest, subtlest and confusing performances in memory. He is both the film's greatest piece and its big weakness. He plays a meathead -or in this case, a Bullhead - a slightly simple but far from stupid young man whose identity is lost in a swirling concoction of steroids and hormones. He's Lennie Small on steroids - literally - someone who wants to do good but can't, his destiny predetermined by a childhood incident that is shocking and too disturbing to put into words here.\n\nSchoenarrts plays the role perfectly, and yet the character is so distant, so locked away from what he once was that it's nearly impossible to relate to him. There's a small part of me that feels for Jacky, but mainly he deserves what he gets. He's the protagonist and antagonist and Roskam's decision to leave which he is in the end up to the audience doesn't entirely work.\n\nWhen the end credits rolled, Bullhead left me shrugging my shoulders, not at the movie per se but at the character the movie is about. He suffered, he lived and he made decisions that defined his life. What happens to him is shrug worthy. Maybe that's the point, but I wish it wasn't. It's hard to say whether Schoenaerts' performance is fantastic or forgettable.\n\nStill, there's something about Bullhead that's alluring. The fact that you never know how you're supposed to feel. The realization that if not for one minute decision as a child, Jacky would have been an entirely different person.

{"text":"Tagged: The Italian JobAudiences that go to see a movie always loved getting lied to, especially if it's from the movie itself.\n\nJake Vig (Edward Burns) is a sharp and polished grifter who has swindled thousands of dollars from the unsuspecting Lionel Dolby (Leland Orser) with the help of his corrupt crew. However, Lionel wasn't just any mark, he was an accountant for eccentric crime boss Winston King (Dustin Hoffman). Never one to shy away from a challenge, Jake offers to repay The King by pulling off the biggest con of his career.\n\nCon movies are just so much fun to watch no matter who or what is involved and this flick is no different. However, something also tells me that it should have been a little bit more different.\n\nDirector James Foley doesn't try to do anything new, cool, or improved with the whole con man\/heist genre but he does know how to still jazz it up a bit. Although the film deals with a lot of dark subjects such as death, scamming, and robbing, the film still maintains a great deal of humor that keeps it moving with a pace that not only tells the story but also gives you something to laugh at. It's a heist film that doesn't really try to take itself too seriously and even though it may get a little carried away with trying too hard to be humorous, in the end, I still found myself laughing and enjoying myself.\n\nWhat usually makes and breaks these heist flicks is if the actual heist at hand can be taken seriously and could actually happen in real-life with just the right amount of detail the flick is giving it. In this film's case, it works and it's very entertaining to see how much detail this film goes into with its actual heist. Some people may not be able to believe that everything here could have happened as neatly as it does here, but the film makes a comment about that and says that if everybody is on the right page and has the right lines, then everything will basically go according to plan. With this flick, that statement is very true and not only was the heist very well-planned but it was also neat to see all that had to go into this one as well.\n\nMy problem with this flick is that it isn't exactly the most original one out there and I think that the lack of surprises was what took me out of this flick. Here and there, the film would give me a little surprise\/twist that would catch me off guard, but too many other times I knew exactly what was going to happen, why it was going to happen, and just exactly what the aftermath was going to be. I mean it's kind of hard to pull out something incredibly original when you got heist flicks like The Sting, The Italian Job, and even The Grifters just showing you all types of originality.\n\nI also think that the reason there were barely any surprises whatsoever with this flick was the way that it was structured. The film begins with Jake being held by gun-point by Morris Chestnut (of all intimating black dudes out there) and he is basically telling us how and why he is in the mess that he's in. That was fine considering it gives us a bit of mystery to why he is close to being killed but then we see Weisz' character, who obviously has something to do with the reason he's being held-up and it sort of just makes it pretty obvious that nothing is going to end up going right for this heist no matter what these guys try to do and that things are basically going to go down as planned. Then again, sometimes it's not so bad knowing exactly what's going to happen because it can be fun, but sometimes you can't just spell out everything that's to come within the first 5 minutes.\n\nThe cast is actually what raises this film higher and made it a lot more fun to watch. Edward Burns is great as the smart, charming, and just straight-up cool con artist here as Jake Vig, and it's a real wonder as to why the hell this guy hasn't gotten bigger roles considering he's actually very good at holding a film down on his own; Rachel Weisz is pretty good here as his main squeeze, Lily, and she gets to show some comedic chops as well; Andy Garcia is pretty strange and goofy as the detective who's tracking down Vig, named Gunther Butan, and he's good as well; and Dustin Hoffman is very good as this creepy and snarky kingpin known as The King, and it was really cool to see Hoffman in a role that was not only funny but also very sinister and evil as if this guy could just go crazy one second and blow your head off right away. There's a whole bunch of other people in this cast that are great too and they all elevate this film from just being another heist flick.\n\nConsensus: Confidence may not be the most original and surprising heist flick out there, but the cast is charming, the direction from James Foley is fun and fast-paced, and the whole heist itself has just enough attention to detail and believability that it makes this film a hell of a lot better than it had any right to be."}

{"text":"People can be broken physically, emotionally and psychologically and few go through life avoiding being harmed in some way. The 2012 film Broken, adapted from the 2008 novel by Daniel Clay, portrays many different ways humans can suffer. At the centre of the film is a coming-of-age narrative, about an 11-year-old girl known as Skunk (Eloise Laurence) who experiences the cruelty and unfairness of life when she witnesses an act of violence. Within Skunk's own home and that of her two neighbours, in a small cul-de-sac in suburban England, people are being broken in different ways. As the film unfolds, seamlessly portraying the joy of childhood with the terror of a community made to feel vulnerable, Broken questions why people are damaged and how they can be healed. What emerges is a film that can be shocking, but also deeply comforting in its belief that the truehearted can prevail.\n\nHarper Lee's seminal 1960 classic To Kill a Mockingbird was a major influence for Clay when writing Broken and that influence is felt throughout the film. Like Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird Skunk lives with her older brother Jed (Bill Milner) and her father Archie (Tim Roth) who is a lawyer. Even the names of the key characters from Broken are similar to their counterparts in Lee's novel. Another key similarity is the pivotal plot point involving a wrongful accusation of rape, with the introverted Rick Buckley (Robert Emms) being a composite of the falsely accused Tom Robinson character and the reclusive Arthur 'Boo' Radley character from To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to simplycategorise Broken as a modern day To Kill a Mockingbird. The film uses the core characters and basic scenario to set up themes of injustice, family, community and the loss of childhood innocence, but Broken develops the themes and narrative in its own way to beautifully complement To Kill a Mockingbird rather than rehash it. Perhaps most interesting is that Skunk is the focal point throughout Broken rather than her father Archie. While both texts are from the point-of-view of the Scout\/Skunk character, To Kill a Mockingbird is centred on Atticus Finch as the moral authority that drives the narrative, while in Broken Skunk is the moral centre. One of the few things that unites the characters in Broken is their affection and love for Skunk.\n\nAlthough, while caring for Skunk is something most of the characters have in common, Skunk is let down by most of the men in the film at some point. Through experiencing first love, unrequited love and family members experiencing romantic love, she is left feeling hurt, betrayed and abandoned. She learns that her father and brother are sexual beings and this difficult realisation is part of her coming-of-age narrative. However, it is the different expressions of parental love that becomes the most crucial component to Skunk growing-up.\n\nOn the one hand Skunk sees the borderline psychotic protective parental love as demonstrated by the brutal Bob Oswald (Rory Kinnear). Fiercely protective of his daughters, whose behaviour suggests they need guidance rather than lenience, Oswald is like a defensive animal. He tears off his shirt before attacking, eats raw ham from the packet and lives in an unfinished house \u2013 it is literally a broken home. As a result of his monstrous and delusional protective behaviour, he has raised three similarly viscous daughters who have grown up to view the world with aggression and suspicion.\n\nOn the other hand, Skunk receives far more considered parental love from Archie, who is affectionate but also firm. Both Archie and Oswald are single fathers and both are shown to have a tremendous love for their children and fear seeing harm come to them. The difference is Oswald has become savage to the point of terrifying the community while Archie upholds the law, even to the point of assisting a romantic rival because it is the right thing to do. Considering others and responding rationally are viewed in the film as essential for civilisation to prevail.\n\nNotions of what it means to love and what it means to be civilised are not the only grand themes in Broken, as it also explores the question of fate. One of the many strengths of the film is its redemptive undercurrent, where a tragic event places a character in a position where they have the ability to prevent tragedy for others. This in turn invites speculation about what events caused the tragedy in question in the first place, challenging the audience to consider the cause-and-effect relationship between the order of events in the film.\n\nThe non-lineal structure of the film furthers this inquiry into how the film is suggesting a relationship between the different events in the film. Most interestingly is the way the film covertly skips over particular events, allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions about the aftermath before the film then goes into flashback to fill in the missing details. Sometimes the film crosscuts between the scene about to end and the scene about to start, creating unusual spatial and temporal links.\n\nThis fractured \u2013 yet highly coherent \u2013 approach to the narrative also gives the film an at times dreamlike quality to suggest it is a collection of memories that sometimes overlap. It is not clear if the suggested memories belong to Skunk or Archie, and it is made even more ambiguous by the presence of images depicting Skunk in the future. The end result is to present the period of time the film takes place in as a defining one for Skunk as she begins the not always pleasant transition into adulthood.\n\nThe film's director Rufus Norris has a background directing theatre, yet displays considerable talent as a filmmaker in his approach to not just the unconventional editing, but other elements of film style such as the cinematography. During the early scenes of the film, the adult characters are frequently shot from Skunk's height so that their heads are cut off by the top of the frame. In the scene where Skunk has her first kiss with her boyfriend Dillon (George Sargeant), the pair stand up without the camera following them so their heads are similarly briefly out of frame. The camera then pans up and the technique of viewing adults from below slips away from the film, suggesting Skunk's entry into the adult world.\n\nThe design and style of the film is also carefully crafted to deliver Skunk's perspective of a world that is harsh, but also full of childlike wonder. Norris uses an unusual blend of social realist style shots with moments that are almost neo-romantic. In particular, the junkyard where Skunk hangs out is filled with broken cars and yet filmed with warm and soft light to present her imaginative view of the yard. Tellingly, a place filled with broken objects is one that Skunk can see beauty in.\n\nBroken is a film of thematic, narrative and stylistic complexity that manages to remain highly accessible. The theme of learning to grow up nobly in a world of unfairness is very effectively transposed from To Kill a Mockingbird, but Broken pleasingly takes its own direction to deliver a very moving look at parental love. While a character such as Archie is comparable to Atticus Finch in terms of honour and inner strength, making Skunk the focus of the story was an inspired decision. By framing such universal issues such as the power of forgiveness, redemption and love through a coming-of-age narrative of a generous and kind 11-year-old girl, Broken delivers a moving and thoughtful cinema experience.\n\nUnder the veneer of civilisation, what ancient desires and impulses lie in our unconscious, waiting to surface like a crocodile patiently waiting for its opportunity to strike? Portuguese filmmaker Miguel Gomes looks to an illicit love affair and his country's colonial past to explore this question. Tabu adopts many of the visual aesthetics of a classical Hollywood silent film and takes its name and narrative structure from FW Murnau's 1931 film Tabu: A Story of the South Seas. The title Tabu also refers to the setting of the second half of the film: a settlement near the Tabu Mountain in Portuguese Africa during the 1960s. Furthermore, the title evokes the English word 'taboo', used to describe something that is considered culturally forbidden. However, while an adultery narrative dominates the dream-like and melodramatic second part of Tabu, adultery is hardly a taboo theme in contemporary cinema. Instead the taboo topic explored by Gomes is the presence of colonialism in the not-so-distant past and how it manifests in modern life. Like the crocodile that is so often seen in the film, the echo of colonialism is ever present.\n\nTabu reflects personal and collective history through the filter of memory, mythology and secondary representation. The prologue, set sometime early last century when Africa was being explored, is a film being watched in the present day. The first part of the film titled 'Paradise Lost' is set in contemporary Lisbon, but is full of visual and narrative references to an earlier era. The final part, titled 'Paradise', is a memory presented as a narrated silent film, of an affair in Africa against the backdrop of the move for independence that led to the Portuguese Colonial War.\n\nThe Lisbon-set 'Paradise Lost' first half of Tabu depicts the relationship between middle-aged social activist Pilar (Teresa Madruga), her elderly neighbour Aurora (Laura Soveral) and Aurora's African housemaid Santa (Isabel Mu\u00f1oz Cardoso). While this section of the film may arguably seem dry compared to what comes later, it reflects the ways the events of Portugal's colonial past resonate in the present. Racial tensions remain, as expressed by Aurora's fevered accusations that Santa is using witchcraft to control her. Ironically Santa is improving her Portuguese by reading a translated copy of Daniel Defoe's classic novel Robinson Crusoe, widely regarded as a prototype text for colonialism and known for its idealised representation of the obedient 'savage' servant. Meanwhile, images of Portugal's colonialist past in Africa begin to infiltrate this first half of the film through details such as the pillars in a nursing home being covered with vines.\n\nTabu is shot in black and white, has the 1.33:1 aspect ratio associated with early cinema and is experimental in its use of sound and dialogue. The effect is different to the overt silent era homage found in The Artist, as it instead appropriates key silent era stylistic techniques to draw attention to the artificiality of the film while still taking the audience into the world of the film (something that Guy Maddin also achieves, but through slightly different stylistic approaches to Gomes).\n\nIdeas of artificiality are spread throughout Tabu, reflecting how cinema is not a reliable historical document and the extent to which the culture created by a colonising country within another country will always feel false and out of place. The over-the-top melodrama of the narration during the prologue, about a melancholic explorer, signals Gomes's intent to make a film that is removed from any notions of cinematic realism. During the prologue the camera is mostly static with only very slight movements. The figures shown onscreen are not unlike characters from a Wes Anderson film, standing without expression. The visual style juxtaposes against the narrator's grand tale of loss and loneliness, indicating how stories are embellished in the telling of them.\n\nWhen Pilar leaves the cinema after watching the film about the explorer, the increased camera movement suggests the handheld style commonly associated with contemporary social-realist cinema. However, Gomes quickly undermines any hint of realism when Pilar engages in a strangely mannered conversation with a backpacker. As neither Pilar nor the backpacker speak the other person's language, they communicate in English, a secondary language for them both that they speak very formally. The almost absurdist exchange highlights a layer of artificiality in terms of the limitations of communicating in different languages.\n\nThe challenges to authenticity continue through ideas of distrust and false appearances. What Aurora says about her daughter is completely different to the reality of the situation, Aurora denies the contents of a letter she sends, Pilar only puts up a disliked painting on the wall in case its painter drops by to visit. After dreaming that her son-in-law was a monkey, Aurora muses of the symbolism and then declares that dreams are unreliable. Pilar goes on a date to the cinema with her painter friend, but he falls asleep so she experiences the film by herself with only the illusion of companionship. A Portuguese version of 'Be My Baby' plays on the film's soundtrack, another fragment of the past returning to the present, made even more explicit when the same version of the song appears again in the second half of the film.\n\nWhen the film begins its 'Paradise' second-half in Africa, the themes become far more pronounced just as the silent-era stylistic influences take over to deliver a mesmerising cinematic experience that reflects the memories of the film's narrator. While the love affair between a younger Aurora (Ana Moreira) and the explorer Ventura (Carloto Cotta) takes place, the country around them is changing. Gomes never directly depicts the conflicts of the Portuguese Colonial War, but contains references to the violence through reports that are usually delivered during social gatherings.\n\nPerhaps by focusing on the illicit love affair between Aurora and Ventura rather than the rise of the African nationalists, Gomes is making a statement about how trivial stories engage more than important ones. However, their forbidden romance does function as a metaphor for colonialism, where the indulgences of a few result in far greater damages to others. The reoccurring image of the crocodile, which was first seen as the bringer of misery in the film-within-a-film prologue, appears frequently in this second section. Like untamed lust that goes against social order, the desire to conquer and colonise, and the impulse to act violently, the crocodile is a dark, mysterious and ancient force that lies beneath the surface and causes unstoppable devastation when it rises and strikes.\n\nTabu is a rich puzzle film full of ideas and open to interpretation. Repeat viewings are extremely rewarding in terms of both making more sense out of the film's distancing yet necessary first half, and for teasing out some of the reoccurring ideas to do with artificiality, cinema, memories, race, colonialism and forbidden love. While the path through this unconventional film is not always obvious, it is a sensuous, mysterious and intoxicating path worth taking.\n\nWhen not reviewing films I work for the Melbourne International Film Festival on the programming team. The first part of the 2013 MIFF program was announced today and I'm very excited, as it is one of the sections that I worked on. The following is a presentation I gave last Friday to launch the Next Gen program for this year:\n\nNext Gen is a program of entertaining and challenging cinema selected for a youth audience.\n\nThe program was established in 2007 to enrich the cinema experience for younger viewers, as well as stimulate discussion and social awareness. Encouraging students to become active viewers, who question and challenge the moving image, is essential in a media-saturated era. The films this year were selected for their diversity, innovation and high quality, as well as being relevant and accessible to audiences of all ages. Through drama, documentary and animation, issues such as family, prejudice, injustice, violence, rebellion, identity and overcoming hardship are explored with integrity and depth.\n\nWith a handful of exceptions, these are not films many people would traditionally classify as 'kids' or 'family' films. Instead, they are a diverse, innovative and high quality collection of films that will appeal to people of all ages.\n\nValentine Road\n\nThe documentary Valentine Road is something that will resonate with very wide audiences. It is about the 2008 murder of 15-year-old Lawrence 'Larry' King by one of his classmates. It becomes apparent that the murder was a hate crime, committed in response to King's sexuality and gender identification. Director Marta Cunningham, who will be a festival guest, allows the teachers, friends and legal experts involved in the subsequent trial to speak for themselves without overt judgment. By doing so Cunningham delivers an insight into how young people are affected by the environments they grow up in, especially ones that cultivate and even excuse violent crime, as a response to somebody deemed different.\n\nAnother film to confront the impact of violence is the Irish film What Richard Did, by director Lenny Abrahamson. This extremely sophisticated drama is about the kind of guy Australians would consider 'a good bloke.' Richard is charismatic, friendly, attractive and a high achiever. He's a good friend, a respectful son and looks after others. He then does something in the heat of the moment that has an unexpectedly devastating effect. This film about culpability, masculinity and the dangers of alcohol is particularly relevant to Australian audiences, many of who will no doubt recognise how closely the events in this film reflect various stories in the news from the past twelve months.\n\nAn interesting contrast to Valentine Road and What Richard Did is the Canadian film Blackbird, about a teenage boy falsely accused of planning a school massacre. Evoking recent films such as The Huntand West of Memphis, this is a film about persecution as a result of mob hysteria. Many will identify with the young protagonist who identifies as a goth resulting in an outsider status that sees him bullied at school and then falsely accused after he vents his frustration by writing a revenge fantasy short story that he then unwisely shares online. Director Jason Buxton shared the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival SKYY Vodka Award for Best Canadian First Feature Film with Brandon Cronenberg for Antiviral.\n\nI Declare War\n\nOn a lighter note, the Canadian film I Declare Waris a sort of updated Lord of the Flies with a touch of Where the Wild Things Are. The film is set in a forest on one summer's day, where two groups of kids play an elaborate war game. The kids carry sticks and water bombs, but the film depicts their 'weapons' the way the kids see them \u2013 as machine guns and grenades. Constantly alternating between fantasy and reality, I Declare War is a parody of war film clich\u00e9s, a kid-centric adventure film and at times a disturbing look at learned behaviour. However, it's mostly a lot of fun.\n\nAlso fun is the South Korean supernatural romantic comedy\/drama A Werewolf Boy, which is thankfully far closer in spirit to Edward Scissorhands than it is to the Twilight films. MIFF regulars may recognise the name of filmmaker Jo Sung-hee as the director of End of Animalfrom MIFF 2011. However, it is unlikely that audiences will detect any similarities between the two films, which are completely different from each other in terms of style, tone and pace.\n\nAnother regional film in Next Gen is Touch of the Light, a Taiwan\/Hong Kong co-production featuring the young vision-impair pianist Huang Yu-siang playing himself in a fictionalised story of his experiences entering music school. This crowd-pleasure was a huge hit in Taiwan and has been supported by the acclaimed Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai.\n\nCapturing Dad\n\nAlso close to home is the odd yet endearing Japanese comedy\/drama Capturing Dad, about two sisters awkwardly attending the funeral of a father they never knew. It's refreshing to see a film with such a strong and sophisticated focus on the relationship between sisters (and between mothers and daughters), and Capturing Dad manages to be extremely charming without ever resorting to sentimentality. In fact, a lot of the humour is surprising dark.\n\nOther films that edge more into crowd-pleasuring\/family film territory are the Kurdish-language film Bekasand the German film Patty's Catchup. Based on the experiences of the films writer\/director Karzan Kader, Bekas is a spirited adventure film about two orphaned brothers trying to flee Iraq during Sadaam Hussein's rule. Tina von Traben's Patty's Catchup is a fun family drama about three sisters attempting to run a sausage stand, despite one of the sisters preferring to follow her dreams of being a renowned chef.\n\nThe film most suitable for very young audiences is the lovely animated film Moon Man by Stephan Schesch, based on Tomi Ungerer's classic picture book of the same name. However, there are enough Monty Pythonesque and surreal visual gags to keep audiences of all ages entertained. It is also nice to see a film that aligns scientific curiosity with childlike wonder while satirising governments that are obsessed with jingoism and aggression.\n\nAnother animation in the program is the stunning beautiful and moving Day of the Crowsby Jean-Christophe Dessaint. Although it is a French-language film, it contains more than a hint of influence from Studio Ghibli, not just visually, but with its blend of fantasy, humour and whimsy, with some very grounded themes concerning persecution and parental neglect. It also features voice acting by Jean Reno and the late Claude Chabrol.\n\nApproved for Adoption\n\nThe other impressive French-language animation in the program is Approved for Adoption, the Audience Award winner at last year's Annecy International Animation Film Festival. A sort of animated memoir in the vein of Waltz with Bashirand Persepolis, it is about the childhood experiences of Jung, the film's writer and co-director (with Laurent Boileau). After the Korean War Jung was abandoned as a baby and adopted by a Belgium family resulting in a childhood where he struggled with his cultural identity and sense of belonging.\n\nThe final film in the Next Gen program is English language, but by French director Laurent Cantet, who won the Palme d'Or in 2008 for his film The Class. The film is Foxfire, based on a 1993 novel by Joyce Carol Oates. Featuring nearly all young female cast, the film is set in 1950s upstate New York and follows the misadventures of a group of teenage girls who begin to fight back against the patriarchy. The mixture of protofeminism, socialism and teen rebellion results in an exhilarating film that explores how criminality and organised resistance are regarded.\n\nCinema is often at its best when it presents characters and stories that teeter on the edge of civilisation and morality. More interesting is when a film itself walks a tightrope between conventional narrative cinema and something that challenges audience expectations about film form. The Place Beyond the Pines derives its title from a loose English translation of the Native American word Schenectady, the name of the New York State city where the film is set. This title also evokes the sense of an otherworldly space beyond the recognisable world, in a way not too dissimilar to the mysterious forest in the television series Twin Peaks(created by Mark Frost and David Lynch, 1990-1991). While The Place Beyond the Pines is a far less abstract work than something like Twin Peaks, it still possesses a mysterious examination of morality and fate through characters who mirror each other throughout the film's unexpected shifts.\n\nDirector and co-writer Derek Cianfrance previously demonstrated his skill in handling interlinking narratives from different time periods in the tragic love story Blue Valentine. What he is doing in The Place Beyond the Pines is less obvious, but more ambitious even if it ultimately is not as satisfying as his previous film. Nevertheless, The Place Beyond the Pines contains a commendable attempt to experiment with film narrative in a way that emphasises the themes of the film.\n\nCianfrance has teamed up again with actor Ryan Gosling who as the character Luke Glanton is introduced breathing in darkness before a continuous long shot shows us his tattooed body as he plays with a knife and then walks through a carnival where he will take part in a motorbike stunt display. He is a transgressive character from the fringe of society who later leaves the transient space of the carnival in an attempt to create a 'normal' life upon learning that he has had a son with Romina (Eva Mendes), an ex lover who lives locally. At the climax of the impressive introductory long shot, Luke rides his motorbike into a large circular metal cage with two unseen co-riders as the performance begins. The structure of The Place Beyond the Pines is reflected symbolically by the cage as an enclosed narrative containing interlinking riders whose destiny is in the hands of each other.\n\nAs the film develops it becomes a study of the sliding scale of morality. It is established that prospects for Luke are limited so he makes decisions that challenge the audience's perception of him as an underdog who is trying to better himself. Cianfrance and Gosling display considerable talent in making Luke a character who is in one moment likeable and in another compromising good will and common sense. Later in the film he is paralleled with Bradley Cooper's policeman character Avery Cross, who exists on the opposite side of the law, but is also challenged with difficult moral decisions and as a result makes compromises and struggles to emerge unscathed.\n\nAs well as narrative and relationship similarities, both characters are presented through similar stylistic techniques, filmed by tracking shots from behind accompanied by the same 'heavenly' choral music to emphasise their fall from grace. With his blond hair and torn white t-shirt Luke in particular resembles something of a fallen angel. Considering the themes of fate and fatherhood that loom large over the film, the symbolism of a sinning angel who is cast out of heaven by its creator is fitting.\n\nThe thematic duality between Luke and Avery evokes the police procedural melodramas by directors such as John Woo and Michael Mann where class and social order puts two men who could have been best friends on opposite sides of the law. Also, like a less literal version of the split personalities of many of the characters in Twin Peaks and some of David Lynch's later films, Luke and Avery could arguably be considered as light and dark versions of the same characters, although with each containing several shades of grey. Their duality in narrative terms is even more interesting and in the film's most exhilarating scene, one character is seen from the point-of-view of the other, as if this character is seeing a projection \u2013 or an echo from the past \u2013 of his symbolic other self. It is like Special Agent Dale Cooper encountering his dark doppelg\u00e4nger in Twin Peaks or perhaps David Bowman in 2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick, 1968) encountering aged versions of himself before becoming what he sees. The use of narrative structure in The Place Beyond the Pines lends itself to considering the characters in a way that goes beyond what literally happens to them onscreen.\n\nPerhaps the reason the film concludes in a way that does not fulfil earlier expectations is because it breaks free from its contained and interwoven structure, encapsulated by the circular metal cage containing the three stunt riders performing for the audience. The symbolic dual-sided identity evolves into something else that does not feel as sophisticated as what has come before it. The morality themes remain, but the film ultimately focuses more on the role of the father and the question of fate. It is a good ending, but it does not live up to the expectation set up by the film's earlier ambition.\n\nDespite the film's focus on male identity, at the centre of The Place Beyond the Pines is Eva Mendes's Romina character who goes through continual hardship while the male characters wrestle with their conscience, desires and drives. A reoccurring image throughout the film is a photo of her, Luke and their son. Luke has his hand over her eyes as an act that can be read as both him protecting her from the fact that the illusion of their happy family life is temporary, or as an act that suggests how much he is hiding from her. Like the nightclub singer who is blinded by the shootout in John Woo's The Killer (1989), Romina suffers as a result of the men around her and this suffering includes being kept figuratively in the dark.\n\nOn the surface a crime narrative with social realism characteristics, The Place Beyond the Pines delivers an unexpected narrative structure where the viewer is invited to link together various characters, motifs and narrative threads beyond the obvious connections. While it is still a rewarding film on face value, The Place Beyond the Pines offers additional pleasures for viewers keen to delve further. The final segment of the film does disappoint when it moves away from morality and identity to instead focus on the role of the father and fate, but it is nevertheless an overall bold and intriguing film.\n\n'What do you know about it? Who are you anyway? Who are you? Criminals? Are you proud of yourselves?' pleads Peter Lorre as Hans Beckert at the climax of Fritz Lang's seminal masterpiece M (1931). As a serial killer who has been preying on children, Beckert is the reprehensible villain of the film until Lang deftly challenges audience sympathies when Beckert is set upon by an enraged mob and subjected to a mock trial. Pleading for his life, Beckert challenges the morality of the crowd who see fit to judge and condemn him, rather than allowing the police to do their job. A terrifying film about a child murderer ends with a savage condemnation of a society that lowers itself to Beckert's level by taking the law into its own hands. Over eight decades later, Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt explores similar terrain except with the crucial difference that the protagonist, a primary school teacher named Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) who has been accused of sexually abusing a young girl, is innocent.\n\nVinterberg's 1998 film Festen (aka The Celebration) was about a man who interrupts his father's 60th birthday party with the news that his father used to rape him and his twin sister when they were children. Festen was the first and best of the films in the Dogme 95 movement, which Vinterberg co-founded, and its stripped back 'pure' filmmaking techniques facilitated a complex and even darkly humorous exploration of the ruptures that occur when a trusted and respected member of the community is accused of a crime most people cannot bear thinking about. The Hunt is a far more refined film in terms of its visual aesthetics, but Vinterberg's social critique remains unflinching. Instead of depicting the mob mentality of Festen where the accusations of abuse resulted in disbelief and hostility towards the accuser, in The Hunt the accused is hounded and not believed by the mob.\n\nA narrative about a man falsely accused of child sexual abuse could have all too easily pandered to the paranoia and rhetoric of hysterical men's rights groups that regard challenges to disproportionate male privilege as male persecution. Fortunately Vinterberg ensures The Hunt remains a progressive film by avoiding characterisations and plot developments that could be interpreted as anything other than a critique of mob behaviour. This is not a film where women are the enemy and men are the victims. Lucas is a single father, but his unseen ex-wife is portrayed as reasonable and wanting the best for their son; both Lucas and the film are respectful toward her. Both men and women are portrayed as rushing too easily into forming a negative opinion against Lucas, and both male and female characters are guilty of asking Lucas's alleged victim leading questions designed to confirm their suspicions rather than arrive at the truth.\n\nIf there is any gender critique in The Hunt it is directed toward Lucas's male friends who move from being drinking and hunting buddies to violent aggressors. While the film's title clearly suggests the witch-hunt against Lucas, it also captures the values of the small town the film is set in, where becoming a man is defined by being old enough to get a hunting license and be entrusted with a gun. It is a masculine and predatory environment, and the ease with which the men of the town assume the worst in Lucas suggests a dark recognition of the potential for themselves to inflict horrific crimes against the innocent. The violence against Lucas is arguably a symbolic act to rid the community of its potential for evil, even though Lucas is not the problem.\n\nMost significantly, The Hunt is not an attack on the legal system that deals with child abuse investigations. The theme of the police and courts failing the innocent and protecting the guilty is a popular one in mainstream cinema based on prevalent myths of judicial leniency. While the legal proceedings into Lucas's accusations are never shown on screen and only talked about, The Hunt very calmly suggests that the system does work. The threat to Lucas is not a Kafkaesque nightmare of legal dead-ends, but the self-appointed accusers from the community. Like the mob in M acting without the authority of the law, the townspeople in The Hunt are the true threat to social order and stability.\n\nThe Hunt is a confronting and fascinating work of cinema. The decline in civility towards Lucas is chillingly plausible, revealing the uncomfortable truth that fears about child abuse are so pronounced that it is all too easy to condemn somebody before all the facts are in. Emotions easily cloud rational judgement and while it seems straightforward as an audience member to disapprove of Lucas's former friends and colleagues, it is difficult to guess how we may behave in a similar situation when faced with such heightened emotions. Vinterberg has created a disturbing mirror to look into, revealing the collective fears and prejudices of a community that only required the suspicion of a crime for it to take a step closer to savagery.\n\nOne of the most fascinating examples of modern day mythology is the superhero narrative where god-like beings, or humans with the ability to be god-like, engage in larger-than-life conflicts that test their moral and spiritual strength as well as any physical powers. Their adventures and trials can be seen as reflections of the collective anxieties and values of the culture that produced them. The films contained within the popular Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise are no exception, sometimes overtly and sometimes unconsciously delivering commentary on contemporary US identity in between the banter and action sequences. The original Iron Man (Jon Favreau, 2008) examined the culpability of weapon manufacturing, Thor (Kenneth Branagh, 2010) condemned the actions of warmongers and Captain America: The First Avenger (Joe Johnston, 2011) challenged the use of jingoist symbols. All are distinctively post-Iraq invasion and post-Bush Administration films, even though the sophistication of their analysis is limited. Iron Man 3 (Shane Black, 2013) is the most topical film to-date, exploring the nature of terrorism and the destruction of the self.\n\nIn many ways Iron Man 3 is a companion piece to Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises(2012), albeit a far simpler take on the themes. Both films contain a wealthy, human, self-made superhero protagonist who begins the film scarred from previous encounters. Both protagonists face villains that are products of the system they come from, and both protagonists question if they are losing their identity to their alter egos. After a flashback prologue, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is introduced as obsessive and paranoid, burying himself in work and starting to suffer from anxiety attacks due to the traumatic events he experienced during The Avengers(Joss Whedon, 2012).\n\nStark compulsively works on new Iron Man suits, alienating his loved ones and neglecting work. He has become addicted to his suits, refers to them as separate entities yet seems determined to bond even further with his suit, fitting his body with mechanical parts like the deranged salary man in Shinya Tsukamoto's appropriately titled Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989). In one of the truly dark moments in Iron Man 3, Stark's girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) attempts to comfort him during a nightmare, but is momentarily attacked by one of the Iron Man suits. The sinister moment briefly suggests the potential for Stark's fractured identity to manifest as a violent and abusive id.\n\nPreviously the symbol of innovation and power in the previous films, the Iron Man suits take on a more ambivalent meaning in Iron Man 3. In fact, the miss-use of technology and science in general is challenged, especially in the way research designed for medical purposes can be misappropriated, as seen in a subplot that evokes the moral quandaries raised in Michael Apted's Extreme Measures (1996). In Iron Man 3 technology is predominantly represented by the Iron Man suits, which in this film are rarely shown as complete objects, often appearing fragmented, fallible and disposable. They are even used to deceive and restrict, sometimes functioning as a sort of giant metal coffin-like prison. Therefore, most of the film features Tony Stark the 'real' person, rather than Iron Man the alter ego that threatens to symbolically consume Stark. On a basic level this allows actor Downey Jr and director\/co-writer Black \u2013 working together again after 2005's outstanding Kiss Kiss Bang Bang \u2013 far more room to deliver punchy one-liners and verbal interplay, which is very much welcome.\n\nWhile Stark is grappling with his sense of self, so is the country that he and most of the other Avengers hail from. Just like the threat to Gotham city in The Dark Knight Returns, the threat in Iron Man 3 is a terrorist manifestation of the sins of the past coming back to deliver judgement. In his broadcasts to the terrified people of America, the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) compares his acts of violence to violence done against other countries by American militarism and intervention. As Iron Man 3 further explores the nature of the Mandarin's agenda, the film delivers an overt examination of the nature of terrorism and how a culture of fear is so easily constructed and exploited for political gain. In terms of the way foreign otherness is frequently portrayed so regressively in mainstream pop culture, Iron Man 3 is surprisingly subversive for how well it plays on audience assumptions. The film also ridicules the use of symbolism with jokes about James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) wearing the War Machine body armor, but giving it the more palatable name of the Iron Patriot, which does not fool anybody.\n\nIron Man 3 also surprises in the degree to which it critiques a large segment of its target audience \u2013 fans. One scene where Stark gets help from a fan is played completely for laughs towards the over enthusiastic man who unreservedly adores Stark despite the indifference he receives in return. Is this perhaps a sly dig at the types of fans who uncritically love the products of their favourite franchise regardless of the end product? A far more interesting moment, and the film's other genuinely sinister scene, is when a previously fanboy character declares he will make a trophy out of a kidnap victim who spurned his romantic advances. It is a brief moment, but an expression of the type of misogyny that can be found within 'nice guy' males with a sense of entitlement and bitterness from sexual disappointment.\n\nUnfortunately, the gender politics in Iron Man 3 is overall a little confused. There seems to be a deliberate effort to make Pepper a more substantial character rather than a damsel in distress and object of desire. However, every time Pepper does get some agency, it is then taken away from her and she is reduced to being passive again. Perhaps this can simply be read as another way the film is articulating contemporary attitudes in its well-meaning attempt to elevate female characters to the same status as the male characters, but always ending up being tokenistic and stopping short from achieving anything truly meaningful.\n\nIn the long term Iron Man 3 will most likely hold up reasonably well as a lighter variation on the deconstructed superhero mythology found in The Dark Knight Rises. In the short-term, the nature of domestic terrorism and identity will likely not be at the forefront of most audiences' minds as they flock to see Downey Jr's charismatic performance and the film's action set pieces. The conclusion is disappointing in terms of the overused setting it chooses for the action to take place, and due to a key manoeuvre by Stark that he really could have used closer to the start of the film and saved everybody a whole lot of trouble. Nevertheless, the scenes of spectacle are mostly fun with a sequence involving people free-falling being particularly engaging. The Marvel films are now established as reliable sources of entertainment, and after Whedon's work on The Avengers and now Black's work on Iron Man 3, the series continues to build momentum.\n\nThe strange bedfellows of politics and publicity are at the heart of Pablo Larra\u00edn's historical film about the 1988 Chilean referendum to decide if dictator Augusto Pinochet would remain President for another eight years. No depicts the workings of the anti-Pinochet advertising campaign that was allowed to air for 15 minutes a day during the lead-up to the referendum. It is Larra\u00edn's third film about the Pinochet era and uses both the film's content and form to address how politicians and the media manipulate reality in order to produce an emotional response to influence democracy.\n\nNo challenges the manipulative power of the moving image not just within the context of the advertising campaigns depicted in the film, but in the way cinema represents history. The film is based on true events, but features a fictitious advertising man Ren\u00e9 Saavedra (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) as the protagonist. Participants in the campaign act in the film as versions of themselves, intercut with actual footage of themselves as they originally appeared in the various televised spots during the campaign. Larra\u00edn has shot No with the same low quality U-matic video cameras that were used for television broadcast in Chile throughout the 1980s, further blurring the boundaries between actual archival footage and fictionalised presentations of real events. This mix of actual participants in archival footage with re-enacted scenes starring a famous international actor deliberately creates confusion about what is real and what is a constructed version of reality. It is not blatant self-awareness nor is it a distancing technique as the film remains engaging throughout, but it stands as a point of difference to films such as Argo(Ben Affleck, 2012)where history is transformed into a classical Hollywood narrative genre film or Zero Dark Thirty (Kathryn Bigelow, 2012), which adopted a faux-cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style to deliver an aesthetic of realism.\n\nThe visual style of No very successfully informs the themes and narrative of the film, which concerns the extent in which Ren\u00e9 compromises the importance of the anti-Pinochet movement in order to produce a successful advertising campaign. The tension is between the desire to act truthfully and with integrity versus the desire to do whatever it takes to convert undecided votes into No votes. The politically active left members of the No campaign want to use the allocated airtime to finally speak out about the terrible economic inequalities and human rights abuses under Pinochet, while Ren\u00e9 wants to sell democracy like he would sell a consumable product. Ren\u00e9 wants a jingle written, the leaders on the campaign want their dead comrades to be honoured. The validity of Ren\u00e9's fun message versus the authentic and politically engaged message is deliberately left ambiguous throughout the film. As Ren\u00e9 argues, the culture of fear in Chile has resulted in a 'learned hopeless' that only an upbeat and forward-looking 'happiness is coming' message can seriously hope to overcome. However, the film also cynically portrays Ren\u00e9 as somebody who brings the same rhetoric and false enthusiasm to every client he is working for, regardless if promoting democratic freedom or Free Cola.\n\nThe Yes campaign are similarly portrayed as being preoccupied discussing image and, later in the film, how to undermine the message of the opposition through ridicule rather than actual criticism. At one point the pro-Pinochet camp even discusses their desire to have key members of the No campaign made to disappear, but cannot do so because of it would be a bad look considering all the international scrutiny Chile was experiencing. The Yes campaign identify the appeal of Pinochet's capitalism as selling the free-market belief that anyone can get rich (as opposed to everyone can get rich) and everyone thinks they can be that anyone. Ren\u00e9's opposition in the Yes campaign is his boss and colleague Lucho Guzm\u00e1n (Larra\u00edn regular Alfredo Castro) who also wishes for his campaign to succeed by doing whatever it takes. While working on another campaign he is shown to be developing a strategy to 'infiltrate the news' by creating an attention-seeking media event, suggesting the calculated way news media has become compromised by commercial interests.\n\nGiven how the film begins and closes with Ren\u00e9 and Guzm\u00e1n going about business as usual, despite being on opposing sides during the campaigns, it feels like No is making a grim and depressing statement about the superficial nature of media driven political events. And yet, the fact that the outcome is the desired one suggests that like it or not, reducing politics to emotional triggers is effective and can be used for good. But how does that ultimately serve democracy? Was wining the No vote against Pinochet worth the compromise that in the long run does so much harm to democracy? Larra\u00edn deliberately avoids conclusive opinions or statements. On the one hand it is hard not to feel cynicism by the film's final scenes or by Ren\u00e9 initially being most worried about his car in a scene where a No rally is violently broken up by the police. Ren\u00e9 motivation to take the campaign is for the professional challenge, and possible prestige. He seems more annoyed and unsettled when witnessing violence or experiencing harassment, rather than outraged. And yet Larra\u00edn still portrays him as a sympathetic character who is reluctantly separated from his radical and politically active wife and attempting to raise a son.\n\nUltimately Larra\u00edn presents Ren\u00e9 as something of a tragic figure who even when being instrumental in achieving the No vote against Pinochet, is still a product of the regime's unsustainable, aggressive and reductive economic liberalisation. Unlike the older and more pragmatic Guzm\u00e1n, Ren\u00e9 does display a passion for his work even if the motivation and approach seemed to contradict the message he is broadcasting. However, through Bernal's acting and Larra\u00edn's direction, there are enough moments to suggest that while Ren\u00e9 may not ever feel politically engaged, he does get a sense of the momentum and exhilaration of being part of something bigger that his own immediate ambitions and concerns.\n\nEven through the battle was won the residue of the system remained. And it is a system based on artifice and illusion: the illusion of equality and the artificial belief of a strong economy when 40% of the population lived below the poverty line. The prosperity of Chile was as illusory as a soft drink branding campaign, a supposedly glamorous photo-shoot of soap-opera stars or a film that pretends to be historically accurate without acknowledging its own limitations and manipulation of actual events for cinematic purposes. No is none of these things because it directly addresses its own artificiality and that of its protagonist and the artificial campaign his real life counterparts devised to end a deceitful and abusive dictatorship. Ren\u00e9 may be left looking exhausted and disillusioned while once more saying the same lines of dialogue he uses in pitches, but the conversation about how politics are packaged and presented go far beyond the confines of the film, making No an extremely perceptive and intriguing examination of the effect that media hype and spin have on the political process anything"}
{"text":"Movie Mom\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo\n\nNon-explicit sexual situation and reference to out of wedlock pregnancy\n\nAlcohol\/Drugs:\n\nNone\n\nViolence\/Scariness:\n\nSwordfights and fistfights, peril, torture, death of characters\n\nDiversity Issues:\n\nClass differences\n\nMovie Release Date:\n\n2002\n\nTwo things that almost always capture our attention in movies are watching someone learning something and watching someone getting revenge. Both are in \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" in abundance, and once again, in this 15th filmed version of the Alexandre Dumas novel, this most resilient of stories has been made into another thoroughly enjoyable movie.\n\nJames Caviezel (\"Frequency\") plays Edmund Dantes, an honest sailor who has a devoted girlfriend named Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk) and a lifelong friend, Fernand (Guy Pearce of \"Memento\" and \"LA Confidential\"). When he is promoted to captain and can afford to marry Mercedes, he thinks all of his dreams have come true. But Fernand, overcome with jealousy, betrays Edmund, and Villefort (James Frain), a corrupt magistrate, sentences him to life imprisonment. His friends and family are told that he has been executed.\n\nAfter years of brutal abuse, Edmund meets another prisoner (Richard Harris), who teaches him to read and swordfight. They plan an escape, but his friend dies, and Edmund escapes alone, with a map showing the location of a treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. He meets up with pirates and ultimately finds the treasure, enabling him to return in a new persona, the Count of Monte Cristo, where he will prove that \"revenge is a dish that is best eaten cold.\"\n\nThe script falters, with some clunky dialogue and a Hollywood-ized ending that Dumas fans will find overly convenient. But the performances (especially Pearce, descending from pettiness to decadence and complete corruption), the swordplay, the splendor, and the story, featuring what is probably literature's all-time best revenge fantasy are old-time-movie satisfying and lots of fun.\n\nParents should know that the movie features PG-13-style peril and swordfights and characters are wounded and killed. Edmund is beaten in prison by a sepulchral warden who clearly enjoys torturing the prisoners. Though it is not explicitly shown, we hear screams and we see his extensive scars. A character attempts suicide and there is a suggestion that suicide is an honorable way to respond to discovery of dishonor. There is a non-explicit sexual situation, references to adultery and a child conceived out of wedlock. Omitted from the movie are the book's depiction of character's use of opium and a concubine.\n\nFamilies who see this movie should talk about what made Fernand turn from Edmund's friend into his enemy. Why did it make Fernand angry that Edmund was \"happier with his whistle than (he) was with his pony?\" How do we see that Edmund is at first too trusting and then not trusting enough? What does it mean to say, \"treason is a matter of dates?\" What does it mean to say, \"perhaps the thoughts of revenge are serving God's purpose of keeping you alive?\" Or that \"neglect becomes our ally?\" How did hope change Edmund's attitude during his beatings? Why does he want to hold on to his hatred? How does Edmund determine the revenge that will be most painful for each of his foes?\n\nFamilies who enjoy this movie will also enjoy \"The Three Musketeers,\" also based on a Dumas novel. There are even more versions of that story on film than there are of this one, but the 1948 (starring Gene Kelly) and 1973 (directed by Richard Lester) versions are the best"}

I'm not certain if he's ever done that in previous films.\n\nBasically, the storyline was real simple. How would one who has been sentenced and convicted of a crime spend his last days as a free man? What sort of regrets would you harbor in your soul? Who can you trust? Would your woman be there for you once you did seven flat? Could you do the time?\n\nI've never caught a case, but I can tell you that I couldn't do a bid. I'd probably last only a few hours. Someone would probably send a soldier after me or I'd end up extended my stay for poor behaviour.

{"text":"Pages\n\nSaturday, July 28, 2012\n\nReview: \"The Unspeakable Act\"\n\nEarlier this year, I was asked to watch \"Mirror Mirror\". There was a scene in that movie where Armie Hammer's character is given a puppy love potion, which turns him into a devoted and even obsessive love slave for the queen. When separated from her, all he does is cry and demand to be near her again. Snow White is able to break the spell with a kiss, and all becomes well again.\n\nJackie Kimball's situation involves no potions, but she is certainly under a spell. In \"The Unspeakable Act\", we witness a very difficult period of time for her. See, she's in love with her brother Matthew. Now, he doesn't share her feelings, but remains close to her anyways. Most family members would probably be uncomfortable with this knowledge, but Matthew seems to understand that it's all rather harmless.\n\nShe meets his girlfriend with a smile and a friendly conversation, but dismisses her as soon as Matthew breaks the relationship off. She sometimes smokes, but when Matthew recommends they quit, she obeys immediately (though she does smoke a little pot later). She accepts answers and advice from him with little to no counter. She even picks his college as her first choice for higher education.\n\nNow, this dependence is a bit unhealthy, but is it really any different than most first love's for teenage girls? The belief that the first love is the only love, that you can't live without the other, etc. She even glows in certain scenes when with her brother. When her therapist asks Jackie is she shares similar feelings for her other brother, she dismisses that idea as disgusting. In her mind, Matthew is more of a lifelong friend than a sibling.\n\nThese therapy sessions may provide some answers as to why she acts the way she does, but the movie isn't really concerned with this, and neither am I; WHO is Jackie is more important than WHY is Jackie. She is a very powerful character with a personality that is both naive and wise; always analyzing herself and others, but still stubbornly holding on to her own hangup. She's my favorite teenage girl in a movie since the lead in \"Juno\".\n\nIn the end, this is no fairy tale; a kiss won't break the magic that possesses her. This case of puppy love may never quite be understood (even by her) or even something that she fully gets over - who forgets their first love? - but I have a feeling that she'll be ok. There are lots of fish in the sea, and lots of seas in the world; once she moves out, she'll understand."}

{"text":"On a normal weekend, there are usually eight or nine new independent films opening in limited release, compared to three four wide releases. But for Thanksgiving, those numbers switch sides -- the multiplexes will be crowded with Twilights and Bolts and Transporters and Christmases and so forth, while the art houses have only a few new titles arriving.\n\nIn other words, there's not much to say in this week's Indie Spotlight, and there won't be any need for a Spotlight next week at all. So enjoy these few limited-release films opening today and next Wednesday: The Betrayal, I Can't Think Straight, Lake City, and Special.\n\nThe Betrayal (Nerakhoon) What it is: A documentary about a family that emigrated to the U.S. after the bombings in their native Laos that occurred during the Vietnam War. What they're saying: Wow -- all 12 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes are positive. \"Lyrical, expansive, unbearably beautiful,\" etc. Where it's playing: New York City (IFC Center). More info: The official website has a list of release dates, most of which are several weeks hence.\n\nLake City What it is: A drama starring Troy Garity as a man who returns to his Southern home and his mom (Sissy Spacek) after a tragedy separated them for many years. What they're saying: Lake City is a lovely title, but the critics are saying it's all wet, or some other water-related metaphor. With 11 notices at Rotten Tomatoes, only one is positive, the rest indicating that despite Sissy Spacek's good performance, the movie is too serious, contrived, and banal.

It's a comedy at first, then turns dramatic in the second half. What they're saying: This one's been sitting on the shelf for almost three years -- it premiered at Sundance in January 2006 -- and is being released now as part of Magnet's \"Six Shooter\" film series. (Cool flicks like Timecrimes and Let the Right One In are part of the same program.) The reviews at Rotten Tomatoes are 9 in favor, 6 against. Where it's playing: New York City (Landmark Sunshine).

Struggling to keep them alive while outmaneuvering a sadistic Vietnamese officer, Braddock ignites the jungle in a blazing cross-country race for freedom..Stan Brakhage's Burial Path, as its title implies, seems to be concerned with the burying of the dead, with mortality. If it can be said to have a narrative, it's a simple story: finding a dead bird in one's garden and burying it. But Brakhage takes this simple moment, this prosaic story, and expands upon it, free-associating around the ideas and images conjured up by this dead bird. The film opens with an image of a bird, a drawing like those found in science textbooks or bird-watching guides, and then an image of the dead bird itself, lying in the dirt. Then the associations start.

{"text":"fter\na major\nUS\noil company loses a lucrative bid for the rights\nto virgin oil fields in\nKazakhstan\n, an unknown upstart oil exploration firm swoops\nin to snatch up those same rights at bargain\nprices. Shortly thereafter, the major oil company\nbuys out the upstart, thus acquiring the oil\nrights by default. Sounds fishy, doesn't it? It\ncertainly does to Congress, who launches an\ninvestigation. Thus begins a labyrinthine tale of\npolitical intrigue and backdoor business deals in\ndirector Steven Gaghan's \"Syriana.\"\n\nSummarizing\n\"Syriana\" is virtually impossible\nwithout giving away the plot and the story's\nintricacies, but suffice to say that the film has\nthree major threads. The first involves burnt out\nCIA field operative Bob Barnes (George Clooney,\n\"Ocean's\nEleven\") who gets the wrong end of the\nstick after taking the proverbial 'one last job'\nbefore settling down behind a desk. The second\ninvolves the aforementioned oil company merger and\nthe subsequent investigation which leads to a\nlegal stand-off between the Justice Department and\nhotshot oil company attorney Bennett Holiday\n(Jeffrey Wright, \"Shaft\").\n\nThe third and last plotline\ninvolves a power shift within the royal family of\nan unnamed oil-rich Middle East Emirate. With the\nincumbent Emir infirm of body, a struggle for the\nthrone ensues between Prince Nasir (Alexander\nSiddig, best known as Dr. Bashir on \"Star\nTrek: DS9\"), a reform-minded moderate who is\ninterested in selling his oil to someone other\nthan the US, and his playboy younger brother\nPrince Meshal (Akbar Kurtha, \"Bhaji on the\nBeach\"), who is more than happy to be a\nstooge to the US so long as he can maintain his\nbling-bling lifestyle.\n\nAs these three stories\nconverge, side plots involving the CIA, a radical\nIslamic cleric and a Geneva-based energy trader\nall materialize and blend together to form a\nstunning and busy tapestry suspended by powerful\nperformances. The most common complaint I hear\nabout \"Syriana\" is that it's too hard to\nfollow. These people must have expected a brain\ndead action movie because there was an explosion\nin the film's trailer. The movie is actually quite\nstraightforward if you invest even a minimum\namount of thought, and keeping track of the\nvarious plot threads is aided by Gaghan's decision\nto cast recognizable actors in the principle\nroles.\n\nAlexander Siddig is a\nstandout as the embattled Prince Nasir,\neffectively conveying a deep-seated frustration at\nthe lack of progress in his country brought about\nnot only by radical Islam, but also by constant\nmeddling from foreign interests. Matt Damon is\nalso excellent as the ambitious energy trader who\nwillingly profits from a family tragedy. Notable\nsupporting performances are turned in by\nChristopher Plummer (\"The Insider\") as\nthe head of the sleazy legal firm handling the oil\ncompany merger, and Chris Cooper (\"Jarhead\")\nas the CEO of one of the oil companies.\n\nPerhaps the aspect of the\nfilm that gives the average viewer the most\ndifficulty is the looseness with which Gaghan\nhandles all the different storylines. He takes a\nvery broad approach, choosing to dwell more on how\neach character's path is affected by each of the\nothers, not so much by direct interaction, but\nrather by circumstance. As a result, there are\nmany details about each character that are never\nresolved, but given the film's structure, they\ndon't need to be, and whatever information those\ndetails are supposed to be pointing out can be\neasily inferred by the end.\n\nThe brilliant complexity, yet\ntotal simplicity of the script is what keeps\n\"Syriana\" moving. The pacing is\nexcellent and, despite the heavy amount of\ncontent, there is hardly a wasted moment. The\nscript's master stroke is how it sets up its\ncharacters, every one of which, no matter how\nsmall the part, has an important role to play.\n\n\"Syriana's\" subject\nmatter naturally lends itself to plenty of\nfictitious politicizing. The\nUS\ngovernment manipulating the internal power\nstruggle of another country to ensure that the\ncountry's government has US interests in mind?\nThat would never happen. The self-righteous\nrighties will dismiss it as a piece of\nanti-American leftist propaganda, while the\nlimp-wristed lefties will take it as a truthful\nand scathing indictment of the\nUS\ngovernment's corrupt relationship with Big Oil.\nQuite frankly, if you swap the\nMiddle East\nwith\nColombia\nand oil with cocaine, you've got the same\nstoryline as \"Clear and Present Danger\",\nand I don't recall anyone calling for Tom Clancy\nto be run out of town.\n\nGiven that Gaghan won an\nOscar for his script for \"Traffic,\" it's\nnot surprising that \"Syriana\" is\nconstructed in a similar fashion as Soderbergh's\nfilm. But if \"Syriana\" has one weakness,\nit's that it is too much like \"Traffic.\"\nFrom the cut-and-paste structure to the fatalistic\n'business is as business does' ending, there's a\nbit of a retread feel permeating the film that\nprevents it from standing out fully on its own.\nAnd while \"Syriana\" handles its myriad\nplot threads with aplomb, by the end you get the\nfeeling that Gaghan wrote one thread too many, and\ndecided to just leave it all in rather than being\na bit more judicious in the editing room.\n\nOverall, \"Syriana\"\nis an engrossing and delightfully demanding film\nthat brilliantly weaves together fully realized\ncharacters into a distant yet instantly\nrecognizable landscape. And for that alone, it\ndeserves to be considered one of the best films of\n2005."}

Once each week, we'll recommend a movie to rent, Netflix, download or steal from a friend. Just make sure you give it back when you're done.\n\nThis week, it's ...\n\n'A Hard Day's Night'\n\n\"Bieber Fever\" has swept the nation, much like the very mop on the kid's head. The release of \"Justin Bieber: Never Say Never\" is probably the apex of such fever, with an unmemorable but good-enough Grammy performance accompanying the ailment.\n\n\"Never Say Never\" is a documentary, showing Justin as Justin, as a kid readying for his biggest performance yet. There are flashbacks and stories, drop-ins and quick cuts. It's a well put together spectacle of celebrity, the insider's look that really isn't an insider's look, more just a way to keep the fans wanting more.\n\nBut that's how it goes today. Celebrities are carefully sculpted and protected, from films to promotional appearances. And Bieber has to be Bieber, the one that tweets, the one that shows up on MTV - you can't make things up, just show the truth as protectively as possible. So \"Never Say Never\" is a good documentary, but nothing monumental.\n\nThat leads us to \"A Hard Day's Night,\" directed by Richard Lester, the first film that really peered into the glass of rising celebrity. Sure Elvis made movies, but those films showed Elvis as a character on a beach. The Beatles first film was about them - the Beatles - and how crazy their lives had become so instantly.\n\n\"A Hard Day's Night,\" though, isn't all about protection, and it doesn't tell the truth. There's a loose plot about Paul's meddling grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell), who must travel with the band and be kept watch of because he starts trouble. In reality, Paul's grandfather didn't travel with the band, and really, we knew nothing about him at all. This whole business isn't part of the Beatles lives - it's just a plot to tie things together.\n\nAnd protection is little, if at all. John Lennon wisecracks throughout, especially in a party with upscale Brits. The humor is near seething as the Beatles take down their uppity counterparts. Bieber? He wouldn't offend a fly, since that fly could potentially be part of his target audience.\n\n\"A Hard Day's Night\" really gives the Beatles added personality, more than what people saw through press conferences and quotes. Back in 1964, that's all you had - some quotes, some conferences; no Twitter, no YouTube, no MTV, no nothing. Protection was inherit. So \"A Hard Day's Night\" tries to round out the image that the Beatles' sculpted early: Paul is charming, John is sarcastic to a fault, George is shy, Ringo is odd. In the most poignant scene of the film, Ringo decides to leave the group for a walk along the river. He skips stones and meets a young boy, with whom he plays. It's set to the subtle and sweet \"That Boy,\" one of the Beatles' earliest dips into melancholy.\n\nCompare that to Bieber. Could you imagine Bieber walking by the river, alone, skipping stones and playing with a kid? Moreover, could you imagine it not being contrived? Of course not - this is reality. Bieber is there for the world to see. Ringo? He wasn't Tweeting back in 1964. The river scene, fictional or not, seemed plausible.\n\nSo in that sense, \"A Hard Day's Night\" is a genuine film, showing how fame can affect people in a short amount of time, but without cameras poking into their lives, and without quick cuts leading to exposition about drum sets and YouTube videos. Mystery, at least in 1964, was much more thrilling than constant information.\n\nOh, and then there's music.\n\nOf course, \"A Hard Day's Night\" is like \"Never Say Never\" in that it's an excuse to play all the hits. The opening montage set to the title song is iconic - it captures instant fame in a way no three minutes in any modern documentary could dream. You also get the lovely \"If I Fell,\" the charming \"I Should Have Known Better\" and the romantic \"And I Love Her.\" Not to mention the other giant A-side from that record, \"Can't Buy Me Love,\" which also gets the music video treatment - a wondrous multi-minute camera adventure through an open lot. Simpler times, indeed.\n\n\"A Hard Day's Night\" is a masterwork of cinema verite. It's gentle, but at times ravenous, and it always seems tucked in its own world. It doesn't shout at you, but it doesn't make you fall asleep. It's simply a film that shows humans in a life that slowly is becoming inhuman. But it never felt so real"}

{"text":"Picks and Pans Review: Mad Love\n\nBarrymore and O'Donnell are a couple of high school kids in love. They rock out at concerts, smooch beside waterfalls\u2014and run away together after her parents check her into a psychiatric hospital for trying to kill herself. A pretty simple story line, no?\n\nYet Mad Love is a mess from which no one, not Barrymore, not the ever-cuter O'Donnell nor director Antonia Bird (Priest) emerges with any glory. Buried deep in here is a story about what happens when a young guy realizes that the girl he's in love with is seriously nuts. But what is onscreen most of the time is a seemingly madcap adventure about two teens on the run. Barrymore plays her character as if she were Holly Golightly gone punk. This is not as interesting as it sounds. O'Donnell is earnest, but he cannot work miracles with his unplayable scenes.\n\nOnce the two hit the road, Mad Love loses it completely. If these two are so broke, for example, why do they pay what must be $100 or more for scores of plump candles to add a romantic glow to their rented room? And when, pray tell, did O'Donnell find time to pack the telescope he later pawns? If a movie is at all involving, such inconsistencies don't gnaw at you until later, if at all. (PG-13)"}
{"text":"\"The Vow,\" which promised to deliver on so many romantic levels during Valentine's weekend, certainly had its moments. But like some date nights that seem to have all the right ingredients, this holiday treat leaves you hungry for more.\n\nThe movie follows Leo (Channing Tatum) as he tries to remind his wife, Paige (Rachel McAdams), of their great love. It's something she doesn't remember because of a devastating car crash.\n\nLeo thought that as soon as she woke up from her coma following the accident, everything would be fine again, and it's not.\n\nPaige doesn't recognize him and only remembers her life before she moved to Chicago and made major changes, like in her hair, her diet and career.\n\nPaige and Leo have a hard time dealing with Paige's memory loss. She doesn't understand how she became the person Leo tells her she is, and Leo can't handle not being able to kiss her \u2014 intimacy that came so easily moments before the wreck.\n\nMcAdams and Tatum make the audience feel for their characters separately but not as a couple. Although the movie includes a few cute moments as Leo relives their great love so Paige might remember, the leads lack chemistry with each other. Separately, they share chemistry with the story; unfortunately, they don't as a couple.\n\nDespite the disconnection, the audience is drawn to this movie in part because it's a true story.\n\nStill, the script leaves a lot of things unanswered. For one, Paige drastically changed her life right before she met Leo, but the film doesn't explain why.\n\nChicago plays a leading role in this movie right alongside McAdams and Tatum. Although the main love story revolves around a husband and wife, it could also be a love story with Chicago. The apartments, houses, museums, subway lines, architecture and city views add a lot of charm to the film.\n\n\"The Vow\" is not a waste of a movie ticket by any means, but it certainly makes you want to rent \"The Notebook,\" or even \"Dear John"}
{"text":"109 minute feature film DVD starring Ian Hart, James Bolam and Julianne Moore. \"This is a diary of hate,\" pounds out novelist Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes) on his typewriter as he recounts the lost love of his life in this spiritual memoir (based on Graham Greene's novel) with a startling twist. It's London 1946, and Maurice runs into his achingly dull school friend Henry (Stephen Rea with a perpetually gloomy hangdog expression). Their meeting is brittle, all small talk and chilly, mannered civility beautifully captured by director-screenwriter Neil Jordan (The Crying Game), and it only barely thaws when Henry suggests that his wife, Sarah (the luminous Julianne Moore), may be having an affair. Maurice's mind reels back to his passionate affair with Sarah during the war years, which she abruptly broke off two years ago. Gripped with a jealousy that hasn't abated, he hires a private detective (a mousy, marvelous Ian Hart) to shadow her movements. He prepares himself for the revelation of a rival but instead finds a deeper, more profound secret: \"I tempted fate,\" she writes in her diary, \"and fate accepted.\"\n\nJordan's cool remove captures the unease beneath formal manners but never warms into intimacy during the scenes between the lovers, even while Fiennes and Moore almost explode in repressed emotions, their faces cracking under their masks of civility and their resolve shaking through jittery body language. There's more thought than feeling behind this collision of passion and spirituality, but it's a sincere, richly realized portrait of ennui and rage against God energized by brief moments of shattering drama. --Sean Axmaker"}

When he learns exactly what \"the job\" Wayne offers involves, Michael tries to do the right thing. He takes the down payment, but visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne, to let her know her husband is trying to kill her.\n\nBut this is noir, which means no good deed goes unpunished. And it's Southwestern noir, which means a plot with hairpin turns, rich irony, and flashes of mordant humor. The hired-gun Lyle from Dallas shows up, Wayne turns out to be a more powerful enemy than anticipated, and Suzanne is, like all noir dames, not to be trusted. Nicolas Cage gives a wonderfully understated performance as a man trying to pass himself off as the strong, silent type when, really, he's just confused. Dennis Hopper is perfect as the alternately affable and deadly Lyle, the late J.T. Walsh is a cold-eyed, soft-spoken Wayne, and Lara Flynn Boyle does a good smolder as the two-timing Suzanne. And the storytelling is superb.\n\nRed Rock West may have a labyrinthine plot that defies detailed description afterwards, but the audience has no trouble following it. If someone who hasn't seen it asks, just tell them it's about a normally honest guy who lies during a job interview. In today's economy, people will understand."}

It's also often exquisitely beautiful, thanks to the picturesque countryside in which the story unfolds. There's ambiguity about how much actual folkloric custom and myth is reflected here, and how much was simply written into the script, but either way it works sublimely.\n\nThe narrator is Aist (Igor Sergeyev), a laconic middle-aged man whose equally reticent best friend Miron (Yuri Tsurilo) has just lost his beloved wife, Tanya. Rather than have her buried in their West-Central Russian town, Miron resolves to follow the ways of his people - descendants of an ancient Finno-Ugric tribe called the Merjans - and take her body to the water. He asks Aist to accompany him on the drive. Since the coast happens to be thousands of miles away, what follows is quite an odyssey.\n\nAist is considerably more revealing in his voice-over recollections than he tends to be in conversation with Miron, and so we learn a fair bit about Tanya (Yuliya Aug) and her emotional history. Miron for his part briefly adheres to the Merjan tradition of a widower going into uncomfortably intimate detail about his married life. Aist takes his caged buntings along on the trip, and the little birds - like most other elements in the story - are symbolically significant. Still, the essential appeal of Silent Souls lies not in meaning - let alone plot - but in its strange abiding atmosphere: equal parts hyper-real and mystical. That said, the narrative arc is strong and satisfyingly dramatic.\n\nDon't be put off by the short running time, by the way.

{"text":"Profile of Satantango\n\nSatantango can be described as atmospheric, stylized, and gloomy. The plot revolves around village life, social relations, and being down on your luck. The main genres are drama and foreign. In terms of style, Satantango is a saga, is nonlinear, and is epic. In approach, it is serious and realistic. The storytelling is slow paced. Satantango is set, at least in part, in a village. It is located in Hungary. It takes place in the 1980s. Visually, Satantango is black and white. It is based on a book. The movie has received attention for being a masterpiece, critically acclaimed, and a Berlin festival winner.\n\nSummary of Satantango\n\nThis ambitious, black-and-white, seven-hour Hungarian film from idiosyncratic auteur Bela Tarr follows the inhabitants of a run-down Hungarian village still reeling from the collapse of Communism.

If you don't know the answer to that one you haven't been watching many Movies of the Week, and TNT's Baby is no exception to the baby-in-a-basket formula. So try to keep up.\n\nSet on a bleak and remote island somewhere in the northeast, Baby's setting serves as an apt stand-in for its characters and its theme. Lily Malone is haunted by the recent death of her infant son and shuns the world around her. The 12-year old Larkin (Alison Pill) sees the basket baby as a shoddy replacement for her dead brother, hiding the letters the absent mother sends, letting the family know she's still alive and coming back. Grandma Byrd (Jean Stapleton) is old and dying. The power goes out a lot. And John does a fair bit of tap dancing. In other words, it's all very depressing.\n\nUltimately, Baby probably has a lot more to say than can be crammed into 90 minutes, and what's left on screen has been done before, time and time again. It's an admirable effort and scrubbing the Hallmarkitis out of the subject matter, but the haphazard, meandering -- and ultimately, surprisingly hollow -- tale won't have you running back for the \"encore\" presentations."}

One man was unreasonably guilt ridden over his mother's suicide and wanted to destroy himself. The other was abandoned by his father and wanted an eternal companion. Also, these things happened to the movie's real-life counterparts (smothering mother, mother who committed suicide). Real life isn't always politically correct.\n\nUltimately, shock cinema just leaves you wanting a shower and your time back.

{"text":"CANADIAN CAPER\n\n'Canadian Caper' leads to freedom\n\nBy Suzie Setzler and Krysti Peacock\n\n\".\"\n\nAcademy Award winner Ben Affleck both directs and stars in this real-life drama based on actual events during the late '70s under the Carter administration. What proceeds is a film that is raw and gritty, balanced delicately with the dry comedy of bringing the best 'worst idea' the CIA could invent to rescue six Americans from capture.\n\n\"Argo\" is the declassified story of how one CIA agent specializing in 'exfiltrating' people from dangerous areas was able to conceptualize a plan to save six Americans who evaded terrorists, by fleeing and taking cover at a Canadian Ambassador's home. The CIA's rescue plan on the surface seemed incredibly ludicrous and preposterous; but with little time to spare and harsh weather on the horizon, it was the only viable solution. The project deemed \"Argo\" was a essentially to create a film studio company that would be scouting locations in order to shoot a sci-fi fantasy movie, much like \"Star Wars,\" in a country that had a suitable environment with Iran being ideal. With the assistant 'producer,' CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) flying in, seven would fly out with the assistance of the Canadian government providing new identities and passports for the Americans, taking on the role of a Canadian film crew. With Iran under severe duress, unmentionable civil unrest and chaos, and a deep hatred for the American government, the farfetched plan would either succeed or subsequently, end in terrible tragedy.\n\nBoth producing and stepping into the director's chair, Affleck does an amazing job of capturing the overwhelming sense of urgency in this film. He juxtaposes the stress of the six Americans and how close they come to being captured, and the hilarity and absurdity of the pseudo film studio, which is headed by Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and makeup artist, John Chambers (John Goodwin). Mendez's and Siegel's pitch faked film to Hollywood, a task seemingly quite easy, is essentially the dry humor needed to not detract from the nail-biting drama in Iran.\n\nWhat Affleck also seems to do is bring enlightenment to this declassified story by opening with a brief backdrop of Iranian political history and the 1953 coup d'\u00e9tat, with British and US support, placing power back into the Shah of Iran's hands. With years of suffrage under his rule, the people finally overthrow him a year before the hostage crisis, placing the film in a historical context and making it interesting enough for viewers; this is notably felt as we flash forward to the hours before the hostage crisis. But certainly, for those who lived through this era, remembering the 444 days the hostages were held as prisoners and the 'Canadian Caper,' the nickname for the rescue plan of the six Americans in hiding, is a hard walk in the park to relive. But as a viewer, we admit, we did so with pride, even though we were uncomfortably stressed to the max until the very last minutes of the film. Again, this is a testament to Affleck's brilliant vision. Without a doubt, this movie will garner Affleck an academy award for his directing, but even more so, bring back to life a prolific story that seems to envelope the American spirit during a time of hostility. We sing nothing but praise for this film and highly recommend that if you see one movie this month, then make it \"Argo.\""}
{"text":"32. If it was a better movie, the sex scene wouldn't matter. Unfortunately,\n\nit's not a very good movie, and the sex scene in the tent is about all it has going for it, besides the staggeringly beautiful mountain settings in which it is filmed. I found the story and the characters immensely boring, for the most part.\n\nBack in the 1930s, Hollywood and the U.S. went through similar Puritan stupidity, with what was called the Hayes Code, and edited out Jane Wyman's nude scene (swimming in a pond) in \"The Lost Horizon.\" But it's such a great movie that it didn't matter. The notion of the movie that Shangri La was a pristine refuge from a greedy, war-weary world was only slightly harmed by the editing out of this beautiful scene. It made the idea a little more intellectual, but it was still the pervasive idea of the film, expressed in a hundred different ways in the story, dialogue, characters and setting. The editing itself was comparable to throwing a blanket over, say, the Venus de Milo, or Michelangelo's David--just a stupid act of Puritan vandalism that could not really affect the overwhelming force of enlightened ideas that those statues, or movies like \"The Lost Horizon,\" represent.\n\nBrokeback Mountain, on the other hand, represents what? The idea that forbidden homosexual sex will get you killed, or ruin your life? That it's an obsession, a sickness, that is inherently destructive of family life? That it's grabby and violent and selfish? That there is nothing beautiful or sensual about it? That its depiction requires staggeringly beautiful mountain scenery to compensate for its gracelessness and lack of beauty? That those who commit it are almost completely inarticulate, uninteresting, unintelligent and unconscious persons, steeped in an ugly, repressive culture that they never question?\n\nSo, cutting the big sex scene out of THIS movie does it great harm. Because that's pretty much all it's about: furtive sex that gets punished.\n\nI thought there were a couple of good performances in it--but I often see actors rise above lousy scripts and the intentions of funders and producers. In this case, the actors cannot compensate for the poverty of ideas in this production, nor for the very poor quality of the script. And without the sex scene in the tent, even its meager notion of forbidden sex creating unhappiness and ruination in a repressive culture, cannot be fully grasped"}
{"text":"Chess's review:\n\nI really loved this movie. It blends fiction within the fiction of the movie and makes it feel real - whilst you recon at the same time this couldn't be 'real'. It's all about metafiction. A lot of people have lost their feeling towards the world and other people, due to the individualisation of society. And then they invent subsitutes. Substitutes for sexual pleasure for example. People make air dolls look like as perfect people and attribute human feelings to them, but they don't expect 'em to come alive at all. That just freaks them out. People have become afraid of real feelings, mostly devastating. This movie shows the pure desire for loving and being loved."}
{"text":"Other thoughts: I'm going out on a limb a little bit here by trying to incorporate Mel Gibson's recent actions into my review of Edge of Darkness, which might just be Gibson's last successful film if he's not able to get over the stigma of his frighteningly raging phone messages left on his girlfriend's answering machine. In the center of this admittedly dumb thriller is a performance so aloof and out of touch with reality that it ought to be singled out as one of the film's major flaws.\n\nGibson plays a Boston detective whose adult daughter is shot dead on his front porch with him standing beside her. At first, everyone presumes that the bullet was meant for the cop and not the daughter, but as clues unravel, it becomes increasingly clear that there's something illegal and dangerous going on by a private company in charge of maintaining the government's nuclear stockpile, and the cover-up leads back to a Massachusetts senator. The company isn't called Halliburton, but it might as well have been.\n\nTwo conflicts are at the center of the film. First is the mystery over who killed the daughter and the conspiracy that's connected. Second, and apparently more importantly, is Gibson's character's attempt to stay sane in order to complete the investigation. Supposedly, the entire time, he's about to be so overcome with rage that there's no telling what he will do, but he knows that he must suppress the darkness in order to bring justice to his daughter's killers.\n\nThis leads back to my initial desire to look at Gibson's real-life troubles. The tension between sanity and insanity that was intended to come across through Gibson's performance doesn't at all. There's a turning point in the film where, let's just say, Gibson's character isn't able to keep it together, and sadly, this blow-up feels right out of left field. Despite a few times where other characters tell him that he's going to crack, and despite a handful of hallucinations of his daughter which could very well be interpreted as memories and not psychosis, there's no indication that this cop is going to turn out the way he does. This flaw falls square on Gibson's shoulders. Perhaps he's so out of touch with reality himself that he's not able to inhabit a real character anymore. During the moments of histrionics when Gibson shouts or threatens, he's fun to watch, but during the moments of quiet introspection and suppressed grief, he almost doesn't register as having any humanity whatsoever. He's a shell of a character on screen, and perhaps one can point to Gibson's real-life psychological disconnects for answers.\n\nYet, even if Jimmy Stewart were alive and giving his career best performance in the lead role, Edge of Darkness would still be watchable garbage. There are so many plot details that are downright ludicrous that it ultimately becomes impossible to truly invest in the mystery on screen. First of all, the police department lets the cop lead the investigation over his daughter's murder, which is of course a defense attorney's dream scenario. Second, people keep getting killed, though the cop is the biggest threat to everyone. He's allowed to live and move around freely because otherwise there would be no movie. Third, the head of the company shares classified information with the cop which only makes things worse for his own cover-up. This same scene ends with that character asking the cop a truly asinine question for no other reason that to have Gibson point a gun in his face and then ask him the same question.\n\nRay Winstone has a lot of fun playing an unbelievable character with his own unbelievable issues, and the film is convoluted enough to force the viewer to exert a bit of mental energy to keep up, but not smart enough to be intellectually satisfying. Edge of Darkness is certainly compelling enough to pass the time, and the cop's ultimate unspooling does pack a punch. Yet, for all its adequacies, this is still a really dumb film with a lead performance by a man who's perhaps lost touch with humanity to such a degree that he simply ought not to act anymore."}

{"text":"When Kiranjit Ahluwalia (Aishwarya Rai) immigrated to London for an arranged marriage in the late Seventies, she had no idea that her family had inadvertently picked out an alcoholic (Naveen Andrews) who would slap her silly for no reason at all. Initially, because she had been raised in an East Indian culture where females were expected to be deferential to their spouses, the unfortunate woman quietly accepted the treatment without retaliation, and even had a couple of kids with the creep.\n\nFinally fed up after a decade, she doused him with gasoline one night while he slept. The wife beater woke up and ran out of the house screaming, ending up in the hospital where he would eventually succumb to the burns which covered his body. In short order, Kiranjit, who spoke very little English, was arrested, tried for murder, convicted and sentenced to life in a rush to judgment which never entertained the idea that killing could have been provoked. Lucky for her, the case caught the attention of a woman's rights group and of her cellmate's (Miranda Richardson) estranged brother (Robbie Coltrane), a barrister who was willing to handle her appeal on a pro bono basis.\nThat quest for publicity and for a new trial which transpired while Kiranjit was rotting behind bars is the subject of Provoked, a courtroom drama loosely based on Ms. Ahluwalia's actual ordeal. The film has been catching flak from a couple of the activists who had been involved in the effort to overturn the conviction because it takes considerable license with the facts as recounted in the victim's autobiography, Circle of Light.\n\nApparently, Kiranjit was a factory worker, not a housewife, as portrayed in the movie. Secondly, the screenplay employs American, rather than British, legal jargon. Thirdly, the two aforementioned feminists have been compressed into one character in the picture. However, unless you're already previously familiar with the details of the story, none of these slight alterations is likely to diminish your ability to appreciate or\napplaud the significance of a landmark decision which established Battered Women's Syndrome as a defense.\nAt least in England, relief for an abused wife is just a Molotov cocktail away."}
{"text":"Rosetta, the new film by the Belgian filmmakers\nLuc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, is an undeniably major film. It's also nearly unwatchable.\n\nThe film's difficulty begins in its\nsubject matter. Like its predecessor, 1996's brilliant La Promesse, it details the squalid events in the life\nof an impoverished child. Rosetta (Emilie Dequenne) lives in a rural trailer park with her\nalcoholic mother. She survives by poaching fish and selling clothes, all the while\nstruggling to find the security of a real job. La Promesse was populated\nwith a rich assortment of characters and situations, which provided some relief from the\ntragedy of its main storyline. Rosetta is far more single-minded: Dequenne is in\nvirtually every frame of the film. Her world is one of strict limits; she knows only\na handful of people, and is in constant conflict with them all. This concentrated focus should draw\nus into a deeper understanding of Rosetta, but the film's relentless visual style\nprecludes any such identification. Every shot is handheld. Dequenne is most often framed\nin medium closeup from behind: for nearly a third of the film, we watch the back of her\nhead. The film opens with Dequenne running through the factory at which she's just been\nlaid off, the cameraman chasing behind her, struggling to keep her in frame. It's an\naudacious formal choice, but an exhausting one: twenty minutes go by before the camera\nfinally settles, allowing us a moment to breathe. The framing keeps us from watching\nDequenne's face: we rarely see her eyes, and we're never provided shots from her point of\nview. Since we can't see her, and we can't see the world as she does, we are kept at arm's\nlength from her. None of the other characters are really developed - it's Rosetta's film -\nso we're left with no real point of entry. Dequenne's feral performance, though\nimpressive, exacerbates this. Her determination to break away from her life is so complete\nthat her sole motivations are survival and escape. She rages through the film, attacking\nor betraying everyone she encounters. We see enough of her life to understand this drive,\nbut it doesn't make it any less trying to endure. It's rare - and brave - for a film to\nfocus so intently on such a defiantly unlikable character while so completely discouraging\nour sympathy. Yet despite the obstacles the film\nthrows in our way, it manages by its final, shattering scene to be affecting on its own\nterms. For most of its length, the film carefully cultivates an enormous distance between\nits heroine and the audience. This is broken in a nakedly emotional scene that is all the\nmore overwhelming because of our inability to step inside of Rosetta before that moment.\nLike La Promesse, the film refuses any easy resolutions or pat sociological\nexplanations, and we're left exhausted and brutalized. Rosetta is anything but\npleasant, but it is a formidable achievement nonetheless.\n- Gary Mairs"}
{"text":"Aboriginal cultures have traditionally been rooted in the land and nature that surrounds them, yet statistics show a growing population of aboriginal Canadians living in cities. What does that do to the identities of young people, already so assimilated into mainstream society?\n\nTkaronto is the original Mohawk name for the city of Toronto, and the title of first-time feature director Shane Belcourt's film, which asks that very question. To answer it, he introduces us to Jolene (Melanie McLaren), a 30-something artist from Los Angeles, who is researching a series of portraits of aboriginal leaders. She is in Toronto meeting with Max Cardinal (Corner Gas's Lorne Cardinal), an elder who is opening a healing centre in the city to help young people find their identities.\n\nShe meets Ray (Duane Murray, who is also a producer of the film), a M\u00e9tis man aspiring to be a TV writer. He's in town to pitch a show and has arranged to room in the same house as Jolene. They strike up a friendship as they wander through the city, sharing stories and thoughts. The time they spend together sparks an interest in renewing their native traditions when they both realize their shared experience of cultural loss.\n\nThe strongest parts of the film are when Jolene and Ray are just talking, or even just spending time silently. Unfortunately, there are far too many scenes explaining the significance of symbols, traditions and historical information.\n\nCardinal's character is meant to give Jolene's spiritual side some wings, but in ploddingly laying out what every little thing means, the movie drags, complete with melodramatic violins.\n\nLikewise, Ray's scenes with the TV producers are meant to show the racism faced by aboriginals in the media. But the media types come across as so cartoonishly bigoted that one tends to think that Ray isn't so much the victim of racism as he is of his own passivity in not saying anything about it. It's unnecessary to overstate those points.\n\nInstead, it would have been far more effective to show how institutionalized, subtle and \"civilized\" that discrimination can be, as it is in real life, since that is far more insidious than any two-dimensional cartoon villain can ever be.\n\nThese scenes detract from the beautiful delicacy of Ray and Jolene's relationship, which are shot in a lovely shallow field of vision, as if to mirror the way that their identities are sliding in and out of focus in their journey to understand their own cultures.\n\nTheir shame about not knowing their language, religion and customs criss-crosses with conflicts they both feel in their personal lives back home, as Ray prepares for his first child and Jolene drifts away from her husband.\n\nBoth lead actors give great performances; it's delightful how intense, respectful and fun they make their relationship. Thankfully, we spend most of our time with only those two. It's in those moments that the film shines."}
{"text":"Storyline Written by\n<jhailey@hotmail.com>\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nUser Reviews\n\nThis French oddity from second-time director Bruno Dumont is a masterpiece. Four minutes into the film I was ready to switch it off, but once I'd settled into the rhythm of the film I was transfixed. That took about 20 minutes, and once I'd finished the film I re-watched those first 20 minutes again.\n\nA policeman investigates the brutal murder of a young girl in a French town and that's pretty much it. It's even less than that in some respects. For example the girl is found in the opening minutes, but it's 50 minutes before any real investigation begins. Instead it focuses on the policeman (Pharaon) and his two friends (lovers Domino and Joseph). They go to the beach, to a restaurant, stand outside their houses having stunted conversations and generally wasting the day away. Pharaon goes for a bicycle ride and tends to his allotment. Essentially nothing happens. There are maybe four or five actual plot points altogether, and the rest is filled with chat of the \"Hi, how are you?\" variety, long shots of people walking or driving, or opening doors. The entire film follows a kind of rhythmic cycle that becomes hypnotic if you allow it.\n\nWhich brings us to the actors. The DVD notes say they're all non-professionals. Not amateur actors, but real people who are acting for the first time. The actor who plays Joseph does reasonably well, but Domino is excellent (and it's an extremely brave performance for any actress).\n\nEmmanuel Schotte (as Pharaon) is amazing. It's simply one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. Imagine Travis Bickle with 99pc of the anger taken out. Then cross him with Forrest Gump (with non of Hanks' caricature or comedy). Cast a non-actor who looks like a cross between Clive Owen and Alfred Molina and you're somewhere close. He's a very unlikely cop. He's wide-eyed, innocent, and simple. He's slow and deliberate. Brief comments from other characters tell us his wife and child died two years ago, and he looks like a man still stunned, as if he'd just heard the news. This is never hinted at once; we don't ever see what he was like before, no one ever tells him \"You've changed\", but the audience gets the feeling this is a man suffering desperately from the pain of grief. Most of this is expressed in Schotte's eyes which are desperately sad.\n\nThis low-key little film requires patience. Without Schotte's performance I don't think there'd be much of a film here. Be prepared for an extremely slow film, but one that's never boring. It will polarise opinion like few other films I've seen so I can't recommend it to everyone (and there are some very graphic sex scenes), but I thought it was amazing.\n\n6 of 8 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?"}

{"text":"17 August 2008\n\nIt's an embarrassing thing to say about one of the highest-regarded Soviet art films ever produced, but try though I might, as I watched Sergei Parajanov's Color of Pomegranates, I could never quite shake the ghost of Monty Python's parodies of inscrutable art films. You know what I'm talking about, if you've seen enough Flying Circus episodes: stern-faced people standing outdoors, not moving, and then the film stops and Terry Jones appears in the upper corner wearing a hobo costume, that sort of thing. Or, the Middle of the Film sketch in The Meaning of Life. The point being, if you have in your head an idea of \"pretentious European art film from the 1960s,\" I can virtually guarantee that The Color of Pomegranates looks pretty much exactly like what you're thinking of.\n\nAnd yet...oh, there's always an \"and yet\" with me. Though it may well be artsy to the point of absurdity, it's not quite \"pretentious\", I don't think. Of course, pretension is in the eye of the beholder, but I like to reserve the word for anything which seems positively smug about how hard it is to understand, and how terrifically clever the director had to be to make it, and just be a giant exercise in back-patting all around: we who made\/like this film are SO MUCH BETTER than normal people. I just don't get that feeling from Parajanov's film, though I guess some people might disagree with me. Partially, I think it's because any filmmaker out to prove how damn smart he was in the Soviet Union probably didn't have much of a survival instinct, and partially it's because The Color of Pomegranates really isn't that hard - in fact, one of its defining characteristics is how tremendously easy it is to understand, for a film that does so much to violate all the normal rules of cinema.\n\nIn the loosest possible sense, the film is about the life of the 18th Century Armenian poet Sayat-Nova (the original Russian title was actually Sayat Nova, before the government came in, chopped a few minutes from the film, and renamed it Red Pomegranate). But as Parajanov warns us right in the first seconds of the movie, by means of an intertitle, this is no narrative biography; it is an attempt to convey by cinematic means the events in Sayat-Nova's life and the emotions surrounding those events. At the same time, The Color of Pomegranates is an attempt to express in film the meaning of the poet's writing.\n\nThis is exactly why I can't regard it as \"pretentious\". It didn't take an army of mirthless scholars to conclude that the film is an attempt to replicate poetry using visuals and sound; Parajanov tells us so, right at the start. And with that knowledge in mind, the apparent indulgences withing the film aren't indulgent at all - it's an extremely honest attempt to convey abstraction in an essentially non-abstract medium. By and large, it is successful in this attempt, though not in any way that is especially easy to describe rationally (which is, by all accounts, just how Parajanov wanted it). Here's my attempt to do so, anyway: I think the film's use of sound has a lot to do with its curious effect. Most of what we hear in the film was not apparently recorded along with the images, and it's certain that the extremely tiny amount of speech wasn't, except in one instance. So when you're watching water running down rock faces, or wind blowing the pages of books, et cetera, the sound of water and the sound of wind doesn't exactly match the image. It's close, but something is \"off\" with it; and that \"offness\" is the movie's poetry. You see the pages blowing, and it means something to you; you hear the pages blowing, and it means something else; and then the two of those things happen together, and the combination is what causes you to think about the Platonic \"Wind Blowing Through Pages\" that is the poetic, rather than the recorded image. I have literally no idea what this paragraph was supposed to mean.\n\nThat's the problem with trying to explain a work of art which is meant to be inexlicable; if you succeed, all you've really done is broken the movie. Which would be a tremendous sin against The Color of Pomegranates, which is really doing exactly what it says, putting us in the mind of a poet at all stages of his development. But how do you describe that? We don't think in complete sentences, after all, but in fragments, images, concepts. Certain shots in the film are tremendously beautiful in a purely abstract sense (the aforementioned wind\/pages shot), some are interesting for what they show (a detailed, step-by-step document of how yarn is died), some simply put a human face up close to the lens and dare us to read something into the deliberately inscrutable, emotionless features on display. There isn't meant to be an \"answer\" to the film, because it doesn't raise any questions; its goal is to cause an emotional response in the viewer and this it does directly, rather than by creating a scenario for us to respond to. In this it may be one of the most purely cinematic works I have ever seen. But other than lamely suggesting that you go see it yourself, I can't really do much here on a blog.\n\nAfter The Color of Pomegranates, which was banned, the homosexual Parajanov was imprisoned for ten years for deviance, and for creating art that ran contrary to the dictates of social realism (he would complete only two more features before his death in 1990, both of them only marginally more representational). That the Soviet government wouldn't know what to do with a film like this isn't really surprising at all; it exists without reference to anything outside of itself, and the effect it tries to have on the viewer. It has a solipsistic purity that's easy to condemn and easy to praise, but either way its uniqueness guarantees it a position in the pantheon of great art movies."}

She played a rape victim in \"The Accused,\" a woman under siege in \"Panic Room,\" and now a woman whose daughter disappears on a transatlantic flight . . . and is told by the flight staff that the girl was never on board, and may, in fact, never have existed.\n\nWHAT?\n\nBut that's the unlikely premise of \"Flightplan,\" a pretty effective thriller that serves as a showcase for Foster's considerable talents--especially her ability to play a woman who's emotionally troubled, rattled, and paranoid. Foster is in her element as Kyle Pratt, a jet-propulsion engineer based in Berlin who's taking her daughter and her husband's coffin back to New York. Pratt is trying hard to keep it together after being told her husband leapt to his death. It gets worse. On a double-decker Aalto E-474 jumbo jet (whose engines she coincidentally helped design) her six-year-old daughter, Julia (Marlene Lawston) disappears while mom falls asleep three hours into the flight. She asks passengers and flight attendants about the girl, but it turns out that no one has seen her. In fact, no one saw the girl at all, and flight attendants eventually tell her that the girl doesn't even show up on their flight register, and there's no record of her having boarded the plane in Berlin.\n\nAnd so the stage is set for a psychological thriller. Was there a little girl, or is she a delusion of a grief-stricken woman? The story, as it turns out, is based on a real incident. Apparently a businessman's son disappeared on an international flight. Originally, the screenplay involved terrorists hijacking the plane and a male protagonist, but director Robert Schwentke says on an excellent commentary track that they rewrote the script when Foster came onboard and realized that there were things they could do with a woman in the same situation that they couldn't with a man. As in \"Panic Room,\" Foster once again finds herself in a confined space. But this time, the people who are threatening her are right inside that fuselage with her.\n\nSchwentke really sets up this thriller well by shooting scenes from Kyle's grief-stricken point of view. Because her mental state is called into question, we end up wondering, as the flight attendants do, what is real and what is all in a disturbed woman's mind. Because we see things from Kyle's point of view we also see how she could become suspicious of crew members and passengers. There's even a credible balancing act that Schwentke pulls off when it comes to a possible protagonist. Who's really on Kyle's side? Is it the captain of the plane (Sean Bean), or an air marshal named Carson (Peter Sarsgaard). Just as it happened in \"Panic Room,\" there's a rhythm of heavy-breathing and confinement that alternates with periods of rapid camera movement and frantic action. So much depends on pacing and character development in a film like this, but everything comes together nicely. The result is a taut little thriller that holds your attention until the surprising end.\n\nOf course, the real suspect of any thriller is usually the plot itself, if you question the logic too much. You can't be overly scrutinous about \"Flightplan\" or you'll ruin the ride. Just go along with the premise and don't sweat the small stuff. Ignore, for example, unanswered questions about two Arabic men who face post-9\/11 scrutiny, and just deal with Kyle turning into a one-person wrecking crew near the end. After all, if Harrison Ford can do it in \"Air Force One,\" why not a woman? If someone told you your daughter never existed, you'd want to take apart the plane, too.\n\nA five-part \"making of\" feature covers the writing, directing, casting, post-production, and visual effects, with Schwentke and others telling how they got a behind-the-scenes tour of a 747 at Los Angeles International. On \"Designing the Aalto E-474\" we get even more details about how this huge and complicated set was built. At LAX they saw things like the attic, the holds, and the nose cone of the 747, and then they \"expanded it exponentially\" to create a jet-set that looks so huge and intricate that it could pass for a ||Star Wars|m|1697|| spaceship. But we also marvel at how tight and constrictive the set was. Anyone who thinks acting is easy needs to watch these features, which show Foster managing to hold her concentration even as men with cameras spin around her on dolly tracks while she's delivering her monologues. The audio commentary by Schwentke isn't as good, because it covers many of the same bases, but it's still worth a listen. So is the DTS soundtrack option. It puts the rumble in this thriller.\n\nVideo: \"Flightplan\" has a lot of soft background shots, and that means there's a slight blurring and graininess in many of the scenes. It's a filmmaker's choice, but one which doesn't exactly provide a fitting showcase for the new Blu-ray technology. The colors are also deliberately desaturated in numerous scenes, while in others the filmmakers shot using a colored lens or wash. It's not a bad picture, but you won't see detail leaping out at you the way it does with some of the more eye-popping Blu-ray releases.\n\nAudio: But the audio? There's nothing like uncompressed PCM (48kHz, 16-bit) sound to put the rumble in those jet engines. More than that, though, for a psychological thriller so much depends upon visual images and sounds, and here, even the rain falls and drips with incredible clarity and precision of sound. Though there are additional options in Dolby Digital 5.1 English, French, and Spanish with English SDH, French, and Spanish subtitles, I frankly don't know why anyone would choose anything but the pure HD sound.\n\nExtras: The SD release offered a five-part making-of feature. The Blu-ray version gives you two of them, \"Emergency Landing\" (visual effects) and \"Cabin Pressure\" (designing the Aalto E-474). They're actually two of the three best featurettes (along with the tour of Los Angeles International Airport), but fans will wish they had the entire documentary. Personally, I would have rather had another short feature or two than the short film, \"Jet Stream,\" by awardwinning filmmaker Louie Schwartzberg. Buena Vista has apparently contracted with Schwartzberg to produce short films along the lines of the Soarin' ride at Disney World, where the cameras pan-and-scan elements of the natural (and in this case, also mechanical) world. I could understand the logic behind it for the first few Blu-ray discs, because it was a way to showcase the new High Definition medium as much as anything. But now? It seems like superfluous fluff. Same, really, with the \"Movie Showcase\" feature, which gives \"instant access to select movie scenes that showcase the ultimate in High Definition picture and sound.\" Okay, we get it. Hi-Def is better than standard definition. Don't waste disc space on Blu-ray touting features. Instead, give movie-lovers more features relating to the film itself.\n\nBottom Line: Jodie Foster is a master at portraying a woman in terror who's trying to balance her fears with a survival instinct that drives her to somehow prevail. In \"Flightplan,\" as in \"Panic Room,\" she gives us a character who's able to sustain our interest and maintain our sympathies, even as the world presses tightly around her . . . and, by voyeuristic association, us."}

{"text":"Tag Archive | \"documentary style\"\n\nWhy do people join cults? What is so entrancing about them that people not only join them, but are willing to die for their cult beliefs? The new indie film \"Sound of My Voice\" explores these questions, and by the end you might even be ready to sip the kool-aid.\n\n\"Sound of My Voice\" follows Peter (Chris Denham) and Lorna (Nicole Vicius) on their journey joining a cult group led by a mysterious woman named Maggie (Brit Marling) who says she is from the future. The film is set up in chapters and each chapter introduces a new idea that is completely turned around in another. So when we first see what Peter and Lorna have to do to even enter the cult meeting in the first chapter with the extreme washing, blindfolds and childish secret handshake, the audience is obviously incredulous. A woman claiming to be from the future sounds so obviously crazy, why are Peter and Lorna doing this? Yes, Maggie seems smart and her ideas of peace are sensible enough (but just because communism sounds nice, doesn't mean it's a great thing in reality). Then in chapter 2, we learn that Peter and Lorna aren't buying into the cult beliefs. They're undercover and trying to film a documentary exposing Maggie as a scam artist. Ok, you think, I can back these two. But in chapter 3, Maggie's entrancing voice and ideas push us to a painful breaking point. The cult members are gathered in a room and they eat an apple \u2013 but the apple is a symbol and Maggie makes the cult members do something that would have made me walk out and give up on infiltrating the cult. For Peter and Lorna though, it just divides them on their undercover mission. They both have a fear, but while one is fearing the cult's extremeness, the other is fearing that this cult might be right. As an audience member, this also starts to divide your beliefs\u2013 what is really going on in this film and who is right? The next few chapters further divide the couple as more things toe the line and a crucial final scene will leave your understanding turned upside down. Though at first it seemed so sure that the cult was a scam, the end will have your surety shattered.\n\nThe brilliance of this film is its simplicity. The settings are sparse \u2014 half of the film is in a bare basement where the cult members are brought to after being blindfolded. There's not really any soundtrack to carry your emotions. All there really is the dialogue, and more specifically, Maggie's voice. Words are not wasted in this film and almost everything said either moves the plot by introducing a new idea, developing the characters or issuing a challenge.\n\n\"Sound of My Voice\" is not really like anything else and in an era when most movies are big budget special effect extravaganzas with little substance, \"Sound of My Voice\" has a quiet, refreshing genius. It's a chilling thriller with intelligence and is a film that should not be missed."}
{"text":"Take a Dip in Deep Blue Sea\n\nTerence Davies' new film Deep Blue Sea is deep, blue and something you should see!\n\nNot to be confused with LL Cool J's film about killer sharks, Davies' Deep Blue Sea is based on the Terence Rattigan play, set in post-war England, following a day in the life of Hester (Rachel Weisz). Seeking happiness and fulfilment, Hester leaves her older, barrister husband for a former RAF pilot. This love triangle explores how each individual pursues what they think they need, and how they each react to their inability to acquire it, which makes for a solid character drama.\n\nComparable to the work of Tennessee Williams, the tension builds slowly in Deep Blue Sea, like watching an explosion in slow motion. The philosophical dialogue exposes the film's theatrical origins and the banter is much cleverer than what you're used to seeing on a Friday night at the movies. Davies directs an impeccable, purposeful piece ideal for viewers who have grown disillusioned with the formulaic explosions surrounding the boy meets girl car chase during a New Year's Eve ensemble cast of vampires. Definitely check this flick out on a rainy, contemplative afternoon.\n\ni-D sat down with Davies to discuss the making of Deep Blue Sea and all the films he can't live without.\n\nA lot of your films are period pieces, is there something about the past that you find particularly captivating? Probably I'm trapped in the past. I would love to make a modern film but I don't know if that will ever happen. I wrote a modern comedy set in the fashion business and I couldn't get any money for it at all, but I know that period because I grew up then and it does have a pull, a very big emotional pull.\n\nWhat did you think was the effect of the fragmented narrative in Deep Blue Sea? The play is actually linear. Most of the first act is exposition, which I knew i had to get rid of. It's just people telling you what happened! If you can show it, it's much more powerful and it has to be from Hester's point of view. We don't know this until she's woken up and she drifts in and out of memories of how she got there and that seems much more interesting because that's what people do. Either in an emotional or happy state, you remember other things by association and those things are non-linear. Memory is non-linear; it's cyclical. I'm not breaking any new ground at all.\n\nWhat attracted you to the story? I grew up with what were called \"women's pictures\" where the main character was a woman, like Magnificent Obsession, All That Heaven Allows, Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing. It then went out of fashion the late 50s, but I grew up with those films. I'm the youngest of seven and was taken to see those films with my sisters. I just felt an affinity with Hester and I cared for her. I identified with her because she falls in love and is willing to risk everything. That's immensely courageous.\n\nDoes writing the films you make affect how you direct? Inevitably it does, but you have to be open to change. The only time you really see the film perfectly is in your head because it looks exactly the way you want it. It changes once you shoot and I never look at the script after that. Once it's shot you've got to find the film in the shot footage. There was one scene with Mr. Elton originally he was supposed to fall about out of bed and it didn't work. I remember thinking 'oh god I can't find a frame,' and I was getting worried because I can very rarely not find a frame. The script supervisor gave me a wonderful piece of advice. She said, \"Is the action true,\" and I said you're right he should just lie in the bed. Then I had the frame. Wonderful piece of advice.\n\nWho is your favourite filmmaker? Oh there isn't a favourite filmmaker. I have certain films by certain directors that I treasure. The Night of the Hunter, I think is one of the greatest films ever made. I couldn't live without Letter from an Unknown Woman or Kind Hearts and Coronets. I couldn't live without Singing in the Rain, Meet Me In St Louis, and Hitchcock's Pyscho, which is his masterpiece. I can't honestly say there's a director that I love all the way, just one or two films by people that I simply couldn't live without.\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge shooting Deep Blue Sea? Doing it on 2.5 million in 25 days.\n\nWhat's your filmmaking process like? For me it's always magic. Something happens when you put a lens on and you look down it. I cannot explain it, but it sends a shiver through me when it's right. I'm appalled when it isn't. There's nothing like that being really, really moved by a performance that is deeply felt and it's very hard sometimes not to weep because one is so moved. It's the magic of it. It's the fact that all these people come together and we film something. We make a story, isn't that magical? And it's 100 people it's like conducting a symphony orchestra. It becomes one instrument and the biggest complement I was given, the film it's like a single breathed moment.\n\nWhat's next for you? Oh god knows! I've got three films that I want to be funded, but whether anyone will ever fund them god alone knows, so keep your fingers crossed."}
{"text":"By turns warmly sentimental, serial-killer sinister and science-fiction fantastical, The Lovely Bones was an unlikely book to achieve worldwide success. In the film version, those mismatched elements come back to haunt the story, so to speak, making the final product more hit-and-miss than unblemished triumph.\n\nParents need to know that director Peter Jackson's drama based on Alice Sebold's best-selling book The Lovely Bones centers on the aftermath of an enormous tragedy: the death of a child (though the actual death itself isn't shown on screen). The intense subject matter -- murder and molestation -- may overwhelm younger teens. Although the movie's messages about love and loss are ultimately positive, the film is often deeply sorrowful and, at times, quite violent (images include dead bodies, bloody clothes, and more). Language includes mostly name-calling; there's also some kissing, and one older character smokes and drinks in front of children.\n\nFamilies can talk about the movie's messages. Do the violence and intense subject matter make it harder to see the positive take-aways, or do they come through?\n\nHow does the impact of the violence in a movie like this compare to that of an action\/sci-fi movie? Which affects you more? Why?\n\nTalk about the events that lead up to Susie's murder. What lessons can be gleaned from the tragedy? Why is Susie stuck in the in-between?\n\nHow did Susie's death affect everyone, including herself? Dothese reactions seem believable? How doeseveryone find peace?\n\nThe good stuff\n\nMessages: Though it centers on a shocking murder, the movie takes great pains to juxtapose the violence with love and domesticity. Loss, though destabilizing, is portrayed as far from decimating. Death isn't explored as an end but a passage.\n\nRole models: Yes, there's a murderer\/pedophile involved, but besides him, the movie's characters are decent and earnest -- as well as realistically imperfect. Though the mother reacts in a surprising way to her daughter's death, her love for her child comes through; the father is more textbook caring. And the younger sister is impressive in her courage and determination.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nViolence: Brief flashes of a man grabbing and throwing a teenager to the floor and against the wall (though her actual death takes place off screen). He's also shown carrying a bloody bag and soaking in a tub, his blood-stained clothing strewn on the floor. The sink is filled with bloodied water. A safe that presumably holds a corpse is repeatedly shown. The bodies of a serial killer's victims are shown in the various places where they were dumped. A teenager beats up a man with a baseball bat; the man is later shown bruised and battered.\n\nSex: Some kissing. Implied pedophilia.\n\nLanguage: One \"f--k,\" plus occasional use of words like \"hell\" and \"oh God\" (as an exclamation). Also some name-calling, including \"jerk off,\" \"moron,\" and \"stupid.\"\n\nConsumerism: Some labels and signage are visible (Kodak, Seventeen magazine).\n\nDrinking, drugs and smoking: A grandmother chain-smokes and drinks heavily in front of her grandchildren.\n\nFan Reviews provided by\n\n\"OUCH!\" by dck39648\n\"Ouch,\" the book screamed, as Peter Jackson yanked a fair story from its pages and slapped it stupid with cloying morosities. Lots of razzle-dazzle covering the sentimental banalities. Struggled to make it half-way through, which was possible only because I was re-reading portions of the book.

{"text":"Untitled\n\nOne of the best Japanese movies to date. Sion Sono beats Quentin Tarantino at his own game and is creative and original besides.

However it succeeds and is more engaging than 97% of all other films released in the last year, and with a four hour running time besides.\n\nI related to some of the religious fanaticism I experienced in my youth. However, despite the deceivers and the people led astray, I still believe there are truly sincere people that do the Lord's work. I just think Sono showcased how sometimes it can all go so wrong.\n\nThe translation of the film was good and solid for the most part. However, during the course of the film, there were some typos. Then for 1 Corinthians 13, there was the infant\/child mistranslation. Speaking of Tarantino, the same thing happened in his Inglourious Basterds. Shosanna (M\u00e9lanie Laurent) tells a man he is behaving like a \"child\" (\"enfant\" in French), but the translation pops up as \"infant\". So when we heard the passage, \"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child\u2026\" it was translated as \"When I was a infant, I spoke as an infant, I understood as an infant\u2026\"\n\nWhile the above has no bearing on Sion Sono's film (he obviously had no hand in the translation), it did make me wonder if the French and Japanese word for child sounded like \"infant\" to Americans or to English speakers.\n\nOther than that, the film has everything: deception, vying for a father's affection, fights (all kinds of fights), the quest for love and lust, and the jerk friends who will talk you into anything."}

{"text":"Stephen Carty's review:\n\nIf the events depicted in Man On Wire were from a fictional movie, chances are that most viewers would dismiss them as too fantastical and unrealistic. However, in 1974 Philippe Petit actually spent 45 minutes walking back and forward between the Twin Towers 1,350 feet above the ground (a total of eight times), making James Marsh's documentary all the more extraordinary. Given that Petit and his team's coup was completely unsanctioned, it's as much as heist film as it is anything else, with British filmmaker Marsh employing plentiful archive footage, useful re-enactments and contemporary talking head interviews to construct a strong narrative. At times, sure, there are occasional lulls, but Petit is a funny, charismatic and endlessly enthusiastic raconteur(he is to artistic crime and wire-walking what Arnold Schwarzenegger is to bodybuilding), while it's also nice to see something about the World Trade Center which doesn't mention 9\/11 or terrorism.

{"text":"Post navigation\n\nReview: Your Sister's Sister (2011)\n\nUnable to recover from the untimely death of his brother, Jack (Mark Duplass) is sent to a picturesque cabin on a tiny island by best friend Iris (Emily Blunt). Arriving at the cabin, Jack runs into Hannah (Rosemarie DeWitt), Iris' half-sister, who's taken shelter there after running out on a seven-year-long relationship.\n\nNursing their respective troubles over a bottle of tequila, Jack and Hannah find themselves sharing a night of passion, only to be rudely awoken by the unexpected arrival of Iris, who's come to keep Jack company.\n\nUtilising a part-scripted, part-improvised approach, Your Sister's Sister boasts a level of honesty and sincerity that's usually missing in films of its nature. Though mostly hinged upon the lengths Jack and Hannah reach to ensure Iris doesn't find out about their one night stand, writer and director Lynn Shelton touches on several important themes, particularly in the bereavement process experienced by Jack and the unspoken sibling bond between Hannah and Iris.\n\nWhat transpires isn't all misery, though, as Shelton keeps the tone surprisingly light, never revelling too long in the darker moments and the baggage each character bears. Directing from a distance, with an optimistically polished, crisp sheen and a calming soundtrack, she ensures the actors are allowed plenty of space to embody their characters, making them, and the situations they find themselves in, as realistic and relatable as possible.\n\nIt's a smart move, as some of the best, and funniest, moments occur from the rapport built between the trio and the touching interplay they share (a pancake incident immediately springs to mind). No matter how skilled Shelton is at writing for troubled characters, the film is at its best when it lets the trio's interactions come naturally, whether it be through the long walks in the woods, or cuddled up heart-to-hearts. Only at the end, when the outcome of the twist falls back onto a trite outcome does the film lose its balance.\n\nThankfully, the actors' chemistry and extraordinary talent shines through to smooth over any semblance of a crack. Duplass, a master of improvisation, radiates, masking Jack's various insecurities behind an outer comic buffoon. Blunt, who could be said to have the easier role of the three, comes across as charming as ever as the bubbly Iris, the cement holding the trio together. It's DeWitt who stands out though. Her Hannah is dry, reckless and immature to an extent, acting on impulses which land her in all sorts of trouble.\n\nYour Sister's Sister rises above its simplistic conceit to become a smart, perceptive and witty three-hander that explores some deep issues while maintaining a consistently quick-witted effervescence to ensure it doesn't wallow in its own despair. Duplass, Blunt and DeWitt fit Shelton's world with an ease that allows the film to become much more than its initial set up would lead one to believe."}

Walter Slezak and Esther Howard are also both very memorable in their small roles. The movie has a lot of trashy, campy charm to it, and with its dark psychological themes of sexual obsession it's much closer to noir than Dillinger. But on the whole it's just too soapy, largely due to the terrible, string-heavy score and the upper-class setting. There's also not much of the style later evident in Wise's The Set-Up.

{"text":"Masand: 'The Adjustment Bureau' is sluggish\n\nDon\\'t expect too much by way of thrills, but prepare to be won over by a charming romance.\n\n'The Adjustment Bureau' starring Matt Damon is based on the outlandish but undeniably fascinating premise that unknown to us there exists a secret worldwide network that keeps mankind running according to a pre-written plan. An agency of officers that wear fedora hats and carry books with magical maps is supposedly lurking around the corner to ensure that none of us deviate from our pre-determined path.\n\nThe idea itself originates from a 1954 short story by legendary science-fiction author Philip K Dick; and the film works despite the occasional speed-bumps in the script because writer-director George Nolfi sets it in the present day, and gives us protagonists who're likeable and not hard to root for.\n\nDamon stars as David Norris, a hotshot New York politician who is instantly smitten when he runs into pretty ballerina Elise, played by Emily Blunt, during a chance encounter in a hotel men's room where he's rehearsing a campaign speech. There's an instant chemistry between them, but she's got to leave.\n\nClearly he wants to see her again, but it doesn't happen. If you're wondering why they can't find each other living in the same city, it's because someone's making sure they don't. That someone is Harry (played by Anthony Mackie), a \"case officer\" assigned to David, who must make sure Elise and him never cross paths again. When Harry slips up on the job by accident, David and Elise bump into each other on a bus, three years since their first meeting, and pick up where they left off.\n\nWhen David and Elise fall hard for each other, the young politico is let in on the secret existence of the 'Bureau'. He's warned not to pursue Elise because it's not part of 'The Plan'; he's threatened that if he does, they'll erase his brain.\n\nSurprisingly simple in its logic, 'The Adjustment Bureau' is no head-scratcher like 'Inception'. There are no layers beneath layers, hence little joy in the process of discovery. Much of the film involves breathless chases across New York as David tries to literally outrun his fate, but the cat-and-mouse pursuit gets tiresome after a while as the men resort to increasingly mundane ways of coming between the couple. The absence of a twist in the end, or even the fact that the stakes never really seem high enough, come in the way of this film emerging as a consistently compelling thriller.\n\nBut what keeps the film afloat is the entirely convincing romance between David and Elise. In fact, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt deliver such winning performances, you're even willing to overlook the film's sluggish pace and a bunch of gaping holes in the script.\n\nI'm going with three out of five for 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Don't expect too much by way of thrills, but prepare to be won over by a charming romance."}

{"text":"Wednesday, March 01, 2006\n\nEight Below\n\nEIGHT BELOW (Frank Marshall, 2006)\n\nA team of sled dogs is left behind to survive the Antarctic winter in EIGHT BELOW. Jerry Shepard (Paul Walker) trains and cares for the pack at the scientific outpost. He leads a visiting scientist's expedition to find a meteorite from Mercury. Although an encroaching storm threatens to cut short the search, Jerry agrees to put off their return a little while longer at the request of Dr. Davis McClaren (Bruce Greenwood), the scientist responsible for funding the trip. Fighting their way through the storm, Jerry and Davis make it back, but Davis breaks his leg en route and Jerry has frostbite.\n\nWith the evacuation window shrinking, the team tells Jerry that they must leave immediately to get them medical attention and get out safely. Jerry insists that the dogs come along, but there isn't enough room on the plane for them. He's told that a return flight will be made for the dogs, so they are chained in place to keep them from running off. The inclement weather prohibits any rescue for months, though. Once back in the United States, Jerry works tirelessly to get back to Antarctica, whether it means finding that the dogs have perished or not.\n\nIf director Frank Marshall had been willing to take a risk, he might have concentrated EIGHT BELOW'S second half exclusively on the dogs and their predicament. The humans are less interesting once they leave the cold, especially when all Jerry does is fail to convince anyone to take him back to Antarctica and mope about it. The film's best scenes focus on the dogs as they wriggle out of their chained collars and struggle for self-preservation in the harsh climate. EIGHT BELOW doesn't anthropomorphize the dogs or play down the jeopardy they are in, creative choices that bolster the film's realism. While this is a family film, there are some moments that may scare kids. In the best and most nerve-wracking scene, a leopard seal emerges from an orca's carcass to chase off a dog looking for food. (After EIGHT BELOW and their villainous role in MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, seals need a better agent.)\n\nEIGHT BELOW presents spectacular shots of the frozen land and documents the adventure of traversing the icy waters and terrain. It fits well into the tradition of live action Disney animal films that capture the imaginations of kids while possessing enough intelligence and thrills to entertain parents too"}

{"text":"Mont-Laurier\n\nUser's review\n\nIt's an 8 if you'd enjoy a reflective look at human nature and facing, pondering or preparing for death. That is what most of this movie is like. It's an 8 for me because it also has a few freaky thrills, loud and intense, and because it's a drama that makes you jump from time to time as well as any real quality thriller. That's a pretty unique combo that worked for me. However, it's mostly a deep and heavy drama. Going in expecting thrills, horror and intense violence, you'll be disappointed by 95% of the movie. Going in and expecting a drama while not being turned off by 'scary' at times, or a little gory on occasion, you just might love it."}
{"text":"Amour\n\nGeorges and Anne (the title characters) don't have a magical love that one would expect in a movie titled Love. Rather, it's that George and Anne's love for one another shows us that love isn't about emotion at all. It's about companionship, and bravery. Amour will hit you in the gut with its authenticity and boldness, but also with its simplicity and openness of what the human spirit can withstand.\n\nMichael Haneke's newest picture is the bravest film I saw this past year. Even I had trouble looking at a plot synopsis, or watching the trailer, and finding the motivation to go see this movie despite it's rave reviews and prize at Cannes. But the movie was never about the content. It's not about the script. It's much more than simply pouring on the sap as we watch two old people die and say they love each other until everyone in the audience is forced to cry. I think that's what people's imagination sometimes boils down to when thinking of growing old with your spouse. We all desire to grow old with our loved ones. Georges and Anne show us that growing old together, no matter how much in love you are, is tough work.\n\nWhen Anne has her first stroke early in the film, you see the shock and helplessness on George's face. Going from happiness, to having to endlessly take care of your loved one just so they stay alive, can happen in an instant. It's truly terrifying, and nothing in this world can prepare you for that.\n\nThe point of Amour is to let us be an engaged audience. We are all witnesses to the steady decline of Anne. We are witnesses to their humor, annoyances, likes, dislikes, and gentleness. Haneke sets up the camera and lets entire scenes play out in one shot. Again, we are the audience. We see how taking care of Anne gradually takes its toll on Georges. He promises that he won't send her to the hospital again despite his daughter's repeated requests. This was fascinating because, at least for me, I think younger people look at parents and grandparents getting older, and they are more concerned with feeling sadness, or feeling loss, or focusing efforts on making the situation \"better.\" Georges has a great scene where he tells his daughter he's not concerned with her concerns. His focus in his life is taking care of Anne. He doesn't hold any false hope of her getting better. He never sheds a tear. The love that Georges and Anne have for each other isn't any sort of romantic love. They are companions. They have grown to be each other's caregivers. There are flashes where Georges thinks about Anne as she once was, but he quickly puts a stop to that. He has no time to be sentimental when he needs to force his wife to take a drink of water, or change her diaper.\n\nIt's the realism of Amour that breaks your heart. There's no soundtrack. Besides the beginning of the film, there's no shots outside of their apartment. We are stuck in this apartment, away from the rest of the world, for two hours. The inevitable is going to happen and we are forced to suffer right alongside of Georges. What's great about Haneke's script and direction isn't what he puts in: it's what he doesn't put in. After ten minutes into the film, the movie disappers. Subtitles and all. You literally start to live Georges and Anne's life, one day at a time. One moment at a time. We see Georges teaching Anne, dressing Anne. But we also see how he never complains once even when Anne starts to break down into childish fits forcing Georges to slap her. It hurts to watch that. But Georges did that out of love, much like a parent will at times spank their child out of love.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nAmour makes you understand how knowing that you are losing control of your body, your mind, can be scary. But longing to not let that control you, to not let anyone treat you different, is a powerful test of one's will. Anne never wanted to be taken the hospital. She never wanted to feel like she was sick. She wanted to be home, where she belonged. But when does one lose oneself? At what point do we lose someone entirely? The moment Georges calms Anne down from her senseless muttering is a profound moment, only to transform into one of the most gut-wrenching minutes to watch as Georges smothers Anne with her pillow to end her suffering. It's what she wanted. It's what he needed. It was there last love letter to each other.\n\n**END SPOILERS**\n\nAmour laughs in the face of emotions. There's hardly any to be found in the film. It's a blunt, factual look at what it means to take care of your loved one as they are dying. It seems like a simple concept that we've all seen before. But nothing is like this film. Amour is about a moment in time that you experience. Sickness, and death in old age is a pretty common thing in our world, but something that no one wants to deal with. Amour actually makes getting older make more sense to me in a strange way. Georges and Anne showed me the will power it takes, the sense of duty, and the companionship needed to make it through.\n\nI left the theatre not being able to wrap my mind around the story. There's not a whole lot happening. We really don't learn a whole lot about the characters. I left wondering if the story had been more emotional if it would have struck a stronger chord with me. After giving it some time, I'm glad Haneke made the film the way he did. The movie isn't there to make the audience feel better, or to have a significant revelation. It's there for the audience to experience this moment, in as truthful a manner as possible. I respect that. It showed me that showing real life in as unfiltered way as possible makes you realize how meaningful simple moments are in your life. You realize how significant even the most mundane things are. Real life can evoke more passionate, personal emotions than any movie script could ever imagine.\n\nYou may be asking why you would ever want to watch such a depressing movie. Believe me, I was too. But after seeing it, I can't imagine not seeing it. It harkens back to the origins of cinema, where it transports you to another world using the simplest of means. Movies are meant to reflect the human spirit and Amour does that wonderfully. Here's a great quote from Roger Ebert in his review of Amour that I found appropriate:\n\n\"This is now. We are filled with optimism and expectation. Why would we want to see such a film, however brilliantly it has been made? I think it's because a film like \"Amour\" has a lesson for us that only the cinema can teach: the cinema, with its heedless ability to leap across time and transcend lives and dramatize what it means to be a member of humankind's eternal audience.\""}

{"text":"Shower\narrives in commercial distribution after winning fans on the festival circuit, and\ndeservedly so. It's a charming film that gains weight through skillful character\ndevelopment and maintains a sense of humor laced with fondness for its characters even as\nit gently prods their human weaknesses.\nAs the main titles run, Da Ming (Pu Cun Xin) stops at a modern street\nminishower, where, after gaining entry with a coin, his clothes go out on a conveyor belt\nfor cleaning while he has a fantasy shower with multiple shower heads and rolling\nmechanized scrubbers. It's a human car wash and a perfect setup of theme - the modern, the\ntechnological, the impersonal vs. the old fashioned, the traditional, the human touch.\nDa Ming, who is living a contemporary big-city, business life, returns\nto his family home in Beijing where his elderly father (Zhu Xu, King of Masks) owns a traditional bathhouse which he\nruns with the help of his other son, mentally challenged Er Ming (Jiang Wu). While his\nbrother welcomes Da Ming lovingly, his father is cool; their separation goes beyond living\nin different cities - it is a chasm separating different generations and different values.\nHow things work out for them provides the dramatic backbone of the film, but the central\ntheme alone understates the wealth of observation that writer\/director Zhang Yang (Spicy\nLove Soup) packs into a rich hour and a half.\nMost of the film takes place in the bathhouse and Yang explores the\ndetails of what goes on there - rhythmic massage, lather for a shave, sharpening a razor\non a strop, suction cup therapy, games played, fighting crickets. Several small subplots\nare developed - a would be Pavarotti with stage fright, competition between two cricket\ntrainers, a customer's problematic marriage to a temperamental wife. It turns out that the\nbathhouse itself - for its patrons, a center of community in the best sense - is\nthreatened along with its aging neighborhood which is to be bulldozed to make way for a\nshopping mall.\nYang offers all of this essentially from the viewpoint of Da\nMing; as we learn about this family and the bathhouse culture, so, too does Da Ming\nreconnect with the older values through observation and interaction with his father and\nbrother. If the ending is somewhat predictable, it matters little here. What is focal is\nthe way this family, and Da Ming in particular, come to understand each other, their\nfamily ties, and the quality of their life in the context of a changing world. Yang also\nmanages to keep the emotion understated with a theme and a story that might in less\nskilled and artistic hands have overflowed with syrupy sentimentality. There is plenty of\nhumor - gentle humor that arises from real people in real situations (as contrasted with\nmore common recent film humor based largely on adolescent embarrassment with bodily\nfunctions).\nThe mistakes in Shower are few. The transition into a\nflashback story of family history is disconcertingly abrupt, though the story told is\ntouching and relevant. And all the little subplots are worked out with almost mathematical\nprecision - it's too pat and adds an artificiality at the edge of the very genuine human\ncenter of the film. And that center is so beautifully realized, both in the writing and in\nthe acting, that the minor failings don't matter. It's a movie that will bring warmth to\nyour heart and a smile to your face.\n- Arthur Lazere."}

{"text":"Cinemanila 2010: CHASSIS Review\n\nAdolfo Alix, Jr.'s Chassis opens with Nora (Jodi Sta.\nMaria) ironing the school uniform of her daughter inside a modest house. The\nhouse, perhaps a few square meters wide, consists of very few belongings, some\nfurniture, the ironing horse, cheap ornaments hanging on the wall, one of which\nAlix's camera becomes fixated on because it showcases the ideal house. Nora\nfinishes her chore and thanks the owner for her kindness. No, this is not\nNora's house. She lives elsewhere.\n\nAlix's camera follows Nora\nas she crosses a wide cement gap that separates her neighbor's house with the\nparking lot of huge container trucks. Underneath the chassis of one of the\nparked trucks hangs a hammock where Nora's daughter is sleeping. Nora's husband\nsleeps on the cold cement. This is Nora's home, or at least until the truck\ndrives off to one of its many destinations. She wakes her daughter, bathes her,\nhelps her into her uniform, and finally sends her to school. It seems that the\nevents of that morning have ripened into routine. Shockingly, normalcy has\ninevitably crept into what is obviously a situation that can only be described\nas both unjust and absurd.\n\nWith its opening of expertly\nmounted visual cues, Chassis immediately\nforces notice of the gravity of its oppressive milieu. Alix separates from the tattered\nhouses of the slums, clich\u00e9d by the dozens of films that are situated there,\nand slides further and deeper into penury, focusing primarily on individuals\nwho have made homes and attempt to raise families out of parked trucks. Alix\noveremphasizes the bleakness of his chosen setting, visualizing his setting in\nmonochrome, effectively removing any semblance of color from the sorry lots of\nhis characters and the place they live in.\n\nThe images Alix creates,\nwith the help of cinematographer Gabriel Bagnas, are astoundingly austere, more\nstylized and carefully framed portraits of extreme poverty in the midst of what\nsupposedly represents a bustling trade economy than anything else. Chassis, if experienced only as a series\nof moving pictures, feels like an album of black and white postcards of Manila in its most\ndeplorable, most depressed and most desperate.\n\nAlix often shows Nora's\nface, suspiciously serene despite her troubling circumstance, in close-up. It\nis as if he commands from Nora's the same irony as he does from his milieu.\nAfter all, both subjects, Nora and Manila\nas represented here by its port area, are beautiful yet tarnishing. In the\nfrequent close-ups, Alix prompts his viewers to observe Nora, to become\nintimate with her, and to understand the lack of any intense emotion from her\nface as she goes about her daily routine that is rife with oppression, from the\nmen who pay her a paltry sum for a quickie, from her husband who can't provide\nfor her and her daughter decent shelter, and from the society that fosters her\ndire situation. She has been calloused to the point of being deprived of truly\nfeeling. She only expresses genuine emotions, of joy, sadness and later on\nanger, with events concerning her daughter.\n\nAlix exploits both milieu\nand subject, creating a film that instantly grabs you by strength of both its premise\nand Sta. Maria's presence. However, the film attempts to go beyond observation\nof the severe human condition, participating further by enveloping such\nobservations within a story that attempts to push gender discourse. Alix\nbasically paints a grim community where dominating males are unable to provide,\nforcing the stronger women to prostitute herself for mere survival. The film's\ndebatable conclusion portrays Nora's revolt towards her severely iniquitous\npredicament, bringing the film closer to being unduly didactic if not totally\nacademic, betraying ultimately any emotions already invested on the fate of the\nfilm's female protagonist. Thus, Chassis persisted\nas a powerful piece of cinema verite until\nit mistakenly took that final-minute drastic turn for inexplicable shock to forward\na negligible and pass\u00e9 statement on the state of patriarchy in the Philippines'\npoorest sectors"}
{"text":"I could try to devise a witty opening sentence, but why be coy? Argo is one of the best films of the year and another gold star in Ben Affleck's directorial career. After a lackluster summer and a dry spell during early fall, moviegoers were starving for a good film. No, cross that. An excellent film. Argo is that film.\n\nSince most of the suspense is brimming in the last thirty minutes of the movie, some may feel Argo is fine for the first hour, but it starts getting good until the last scenes. Which is wrong, of course. Argo is one of those movies that every time you watch it, the better it gets. Small clues left in the beginning of the movie and quick-witted dialogue not only pumps up the pace in the first half of the movie, but serve to reinforce the dramatic and riveting thrill in the other half.\n\nSo let's see: suspenseful, intelligent, fun\u2026how much more can this film pack in? Well, Argo is greedy \u2013 in a good way. Smartly adapting Iranian drama is not enough; Argo attempts to give insightful observations- not overly analyze \u2013 the ethics of the movie business (or lack of, that is). But it's so well hidden in hilarious lines, we're so busy having fun that we forget actually learned something.\n\nEveryone does an excellent job here, from the smallest (but most powerful) roles to Affleck's calm and suave performance. What else can I say? Argo is an excellently crafted film, one that shouldn't be missed.\n\nWhat an apt name for a film. It's complicated, but not confusing. Involving, but not exactly thrilling. It definitely sends your brain in loops, but not because the it's hard to understand, but by the end of the movie, one has to ask: how does a film that began so wonderful end so horribly?\n\nTo not waste my time or yours, I'll diverge from detailing every little aspect of the plot. (If you want to meet a time-travel expert who know how to dissect Looper's twisty storyline, see here.) Basically, Young Joe (JGL) is trying to kill Old Joe (Bruce Willis), and Old Joe is running away and trying to murder a kid who eventually grows up and becomes a terrorist who murders his wife of the future. This kid happens to live on a farm with Sara (Emily Blunt), a farm Young Joe happens to stumble upon.\n\nYeah. It's not what I expected either.\n\nBy the first-half of the movie, everything is fresh. Fascinating concept, fast pacing, and fun dialogue, especially between Old Joe and Young Joe. But after this stage conversation is finished (oddly the only one of the two times they even see each other), the films slows down dramatically. It doesn't even seem like the same movie anymore. Sub-plots of telekinesis and tired inclusions of inherently bad kids who use their superpowers for evil makes the film seem forced. Old Joe avenging for his wife? Contrived. Even Bruce Willis is criminally under-used in this movie.\n\nOnce the ending comes, with Levitt in voice-over every tying every loose string in one nice little package, one just wants to roll their eyes.\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nDonnie Darko Funnily, this film reminded me of many movies I've seen recently: Magnolia, American\nBeauty, even Looper. Yet, even though I didn't understand this movie fully, I absolutely loved it. Forget the witty dialogue and the excellent acting \u2013 the storyline juggles a number of diverging storylines and handles them beautifully. Time travel? Schizophrenia? Religion? School politics? This film has it all \u2013 and does it all wonderfully.\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 and 1\/2 Stars\n\n*********************************************************************\n\nFor October's Book Vs. Film selection, I'll review the short story and film, Minority Report. Look for the reviews this week! (Thank you to Stephanie for the suggestion!)\n\nOne of the best benchmarks for reviewing a film is seeing how well it stands up days after the initial viewing. Thoughts become focused and precise, where the fog of hype and bartering fades away (\"Well, they did do that bad, but at least\u2026\") and true feelings towards the film surface. I try to employ this with mostly every movie I watch. This is the reason why, day by day, I continually lose respect for The Master and PTA's films in general. Throughout this marathon, I've watched the films of PTA and though I've enjoyed them, there was always something missing. Something that's scratched at my brain for some time now, but after The Master, I realized what was lacking in Anderson's films: meaning.\n\nIn The Master, we are greeted by Freddie Quell, a wrecked leftover from WW2 who possessed some serious mental issues, some fostered by disastrous exposure to brutal killings, some created by the puzzling grooves of his mind. He's unpredictable and has a ravenous sexual appetite. When we are first introduced to Freddie in the opening sequence, including a scene of him humping a sand lady he's fashioned on the beach, one can't help but wonder: is this nurture of his nature?\n\nTherefore, it's even more interesting to see a cult leader, Lancaster Dodd take on Freddie, somewhat as a pet project. (P.S. This film is not only about Scientology. The themes in The Master can apply to any religious or educational hub). We're promised to see an intricate examination of the human psyche as people are massaged into dangerous and cultish thoughts, but the result is much different.\n\nBefore I give my spill, I would like to at least explain The Master isn't terrible, at least not in terms outside storytelling. Everyone here is absolutely brilliant and absolutely convincing in their roles; certain scenes would be vapid if PTA didn't employ old regulars such as Philip Seymour Hoffman or Joaquin Phoenix. Though Amy Adams seems like a flat character (silent yet strong type woman is fastly becoming a caricature in film), these actors take on an interesting script and give dazzling performances.\n\nThat's where it stops for The Master and most of PTA's films: mere interestingness.\n\nNow, unlike Magnolia, some of the questions left over from The Master actually please the viewer and stretches their imagination. Why does Freddie join Dodd's religion? A lost soul looking for the answers to his questions? Why does Freddie defend him, sometimes physically? Does he join the Cause because it's \"cool\" and something new? Why does Dodd take Freddie on? The mere booze he provides? Pet project? However, as the movie progresses, these fascinating questions evolve into major irritations. There are no hints and no points to the movie.\n\nAdditionally, what is the point of this film? Be careful who you trust in? When in doubt, add a sex scene? What meaning do the numerous sexual references have? Does The Master have any meaning? An often recurring pop-up in PTA's films is that there is no meaning. Everything is merely interesting, never insightful. The Master never fully impacts because Anderson mixes characters with lazy story lines (not so much in construction of the script, but applying innate ideas to a film with substance). PTA has a talent for devising interesting and complicated characters in dramatic plots, but again, they stop there. Enigmatic people who convey no truth about life. Substance in films don't equal sunshine and rainbows (American Beauty is controversial, yet it had substance and a point to it: how beautiful life is, yet how fleeting beauty is in one's life, especially one stunted with droning complacency). An well-executed movie lets the moviegoer think for themselves and devise their own reasonable dissection of the film, enabling an emotional and mental connection. There is no such thing with PTA or The Master.\n\nI've been patient with Anderson's films, re-watching movies and trying to analyze those\nmovies where a point can be found. Yet, nothing. It's like being promised a present but having confetti thrown in your face: it's pretty and colorful (interesting), but what's the meaning?\n\nTherefore, therein is the most damaging element in PTA's films. It is so bad that I will have to decline to watch Hard Eight for this marathon. The Master has all the right ingredients: wonderful leads, an engaging plot (if Anderson focused on cultism and not Freddie's decaying life, would The Master have been rescued?) and beautiful cinematography. Except one is left out: purpose.\n\nThis post is a part of the Paul Thomas Anderson Marathon on RandomFilmBuff, a week dedicated to the films of PTA, all leading up to the release of his new film, The Master.\n\nWhen one watches Magnolia, they automatically gain the feeling that the film they are watching is smarter than themselves. It's a type of Nolan-esque film with a complex plot and multi-layered characters, a movie that desires to leave you scratching your head, but hungry to watch it again. Unfortunately, Magnolia only accomplishes the former.\n\nEnsemble films are a tough venue to master. Counterparts such as Babel and Crash soar in a genre where so many have fallen and failed. Magnolia doesn't completely fall flat, but one can't help but wonder, 'What the heck?' Magnolia isn't bad because it's not easily understandable on the first viewing (I watched it twice to give it a fair shake), it's okay because PTA chooses all these characters and what point is he trying to prove? The fragility of life? The power of love? A cool chance to throw in a school boy's fantasy of rambling debauchery? I'm open to ideas.* Yes, the various cameos of the numbers 8 and 2 and the inclusions of the magnolia flower in well-hidden scenes is interesting, the biblical allusions typical, but what significance does all of it have? For a movie so centered on the way our lives are balanced upon chance (a conclusion that seems very far-fetched with a movie like this), Anderson's Magnolia is a bad gamble.\n\nMagnolia seems to follow some invisible notion of brilliance. Every actor is excellent (I'm looking at you Tom Cruise), and almost every word is hard to take one's eyes off of. So we have the two variables, performance + appealment. What's the equation?\n\nThis post is a part of the Paul Thomas Anderson Marathon on RandomFilmBuff, a week dedicated to the films of PTA, all leading up to the release of his new film, The Master.\n\nPunch-Drunk Love is a very special film. It would be insulting to call it sweet, quirky, or just romantic \u2013 even if that's what it is. Anderson uses a number of cinematic elements to craft an intriguing picture of loneliness: the overwhelming sense of blue in every frame, supermarkets and households that only offer endless monotony and the cool chill of isolation, an oddly lovable guy who revels in a dangerous cycle of seclusion and rage so much he tries to find company in a phone sex line. It has the ingredients for an excellent film, and it is nothing short of great, but one can only wonder, \"what if..?\"\n\nBarry (Adam Sandler) is crazy. Not Norman Bates crazy or anything, but he's got some serious issues for sure. Lonely would be an understatement to describe his life. Even in a room packed with people, Barry is always alone. He experiences rashes of anger; it boils beneath his red-hot skin when provoked, and explodes whenever it desires to. But, Barry is not all crazy. He's a pretty sweet guy. A sweet, nice guy who falls in love with Lena.\n\nPunch-Drunk Love seems like it missed the mark, though. Where it did score: hilarious comedic moments, solid performances, and a charming script, it soars. But it's as if Anderson began penning a screenplay that would be the study of the life of a lonely man in a lonely world, a great psychological and emotional experience. But does PTA take the easy way out? Don't get me wrong, this love story is nothing short of fantastic: the music and writing is instantly distinctive and the cinematography so strong that if one paused the movie in any place, the frame would be a work of art. It dares the audience to resist its charms. But what if Punch-Drunk Love was a more serious venture into the mind of an ordinary, but not-so ordinary man? Would Punch-Drunk Love be better?\n\nBut, for what it is, Punch-Drunk Love is not to be dismissed. Loneliness may be powerful and fuel horrible side-effects such as vicious rage, but love is just as powerful, of which Paul Thomas Anderson truly shows. Punch-Drunk Love gets the job done clean and smooth, leaving a smile on the audience's face."}
{"text":"The birth of psychoanalysis, the friendship and schism between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, the influence of a beautiful, masochistic female patient on both men\u2014David Cronenberg must have been jumping up and down when he found such juicy material for his new film. Helmer of such mind-bending thrillers as \"Videodrome,\" \"Naked Lunch\" and \"The Fly,\" the Canadian provocateur is known for his aggressive examinations of sex, violence and madness. So it's a little strange that \"A Dangerous Method,\" though intelligent, wonderfully structured and perhaps Cronenberg's most elegant and lucid work, is not as dangerous as expected.\n\nBased on a play by screenwriter Christopher Hampton, which is itself drawn from John Kerr's nonfiction book, the film is a commendably accurate recount of historical events. The story starts at the turn of the 20th Century, when 18-year-old Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), a highly unstable Russian woman, is sent, by force, to a clinic in Zurich. The young hysteric is treated by Swiss psychologist Jung (Michael Fassbender), who finds in her a perfect patient with which to experiment in the then nascent and doubted Freudian method, the \"talking cure.\" The result is impressive: childhood memories are revealed, self-loathing and sexual frustrations are explained, and Spielrein not only regains basic functions, but also proves to be wickedly smart. With ambitions in becoming a psychiatrist herself, she begins working with Jung as an assistant.\n\nSuch positive progress inspires Jung to pay a visit to Freud (Viggo Mortensen) at his small Vienna home, where they meet for the first time. The young gun admires Freud's vision, while the veteran sees Jung as the \"crown prince\" of his intellectual establishment. However, their mentorship and friendship turns sour over the next few years due to different beliefs and personalities, professional rivalry and the involvement of Spielrein, who emotionally falls for Jung but professionally stands by Freud. Persuaded by the hedonistic talks of Otto Gross (Vincent Cassel), an immensely charming patient and fellow psychiatrist sent to him by Freud, Jung\u2014though married to aristocratic wife Emma (Sarah Gadon)\u2014engages in a sexual affair with Spielrein. The breakup is, of course, messy; and just like Spielrein indirectly brought the two men together, she becomes the catalyst of their famous split.\n\nDreams, the essence of \"the unconscious,\" also plays a crucial role. On a trip together to America, after analyzing Jung's recent dream, Freud refuses to share his dreams because he doesn't want to jeopardize his \"authority\" by letting others into his head. And just when Freud dismisses Jung's mythical interests and deems them a threat to their scientific credibility, Jung recalls a nightmare of carnage that's mysteriously premonitory of the upcoming World War I.\n\nFassbender and Mortensen each submit a marvelous performance, bringing the two giants of modern psychology vividly to life. Wealthy, proper and restrained, Jung is constantly tormented by his regretful decisions, while the sex-obsessed, cigar-loving Freud is full of charisma, but is vain, self-righteous and even a little paranoid. Their interactions (some intense, some awkward), along with a scene-stealing Cassel as Gross, surprisingly offer a good amount of funny moments. In comparison, Knightley is arguably miscast in the double-sided role of Spielrein: her portrayal of the severely damaged patient\u2014featuring a lot of jaw-jutting, for which I have to give her credit\u2014is overdone, and the bright intellectual in her who's able to make profound impact on great men such as Jung and Freud comes across as unconvincing.\n\nBut something that's totally convincing is the period settings, which were designed by the director and crew with stunning precision, from the Merchant-Ivory-esque costumes to Freud's office that was recreated from old photos. Oscar-winning composer Howard Shore and Cronenberg's regular cinematographer Peter Suschitzky are also on fine form.\n\nAt only 99 minutes, some of the latent yet important topics in the film such as race and religion (Jung's Protestant vs. Spielrein and Freud's Judaism) are left half-explored. And compared to another Cronenberg film about psychosexual disorder, his controversial 1996 J.G. Ballard adaptation \"Crash,\" \"Method\" is rather sedate and staid in style. Though it makes sense that the classy subject matter calls for a departure from his signature body-horror aesthetics, it's a shame that the edge, sensation and thrill in the fascinating history haven't been fully brought to the screen. That said, \"Method\" remains a worthy watch of intrigue; and\u2014let's be honest\u2014we all want to see a half-naked Knightley get spanked.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nReviewer's BiasLoves: \"A History of Violence,\" the warped mind of David CronenbergHates: Pandering to mainstream audiencesWhat has happened to David Cronenberg?

{"text":"The Way Back, with its epic story and spectacularly bleak setting, invites comparisons with Laurence of Arabia and Dr. Zhivago. It's awash in vast, unforgiving terrain.\n\nSo it got the setting right, but not necessarily the substance. Even when not being compared with those classics, it falls short in character development.\n\nLocations in Bulgaria, India and Morocco lend an authenticity to the tale of escaped Soviet prisoners and their struggle to survive. There are exhilarating moments, and there are some undeniably tense scenes. Mixed in, however, is possibly more trudging than you're going to see in any other film.\n\nPeter Weir is a masterful director. His first film, 1981's Gallipoli, was a stunning war epic. Even more commercial fare like The Truman Show (1998) and his last film, 2003's Master and Commander, have a singular artistry.\n\nLoosely based on the true story of prisoners who escape a Siberian gulag, the story follows several men and a young girl across a treacherous 4,000 miles, including forbidding Siberian landscape and Mongolia's vast Gobi Desert.\n\nThe era is circa World War II, and the characters include Polish prisoner Janusz (Jim Sturgess), Russian thug Valka (Colin Farrell), American loner Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), and young Irena (Atonement's Saoirse Ronan). One in their group goes blind in the woods as they brave freezing temperatures and limited food and water. Others fight off hungry wolves and contemplate cannibalism.\n\nInspired by the 1956 book The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom, the movie ricochets between inspirational and tedious. No doubt the actual journey had a similar duality.\n\nBut the film, at more than two hours, feels overly long. Except for moments of aching despair, individual characters are not given distinct traits. They exhibit varying degrees of resourcefulness, but their personalities are drab, lost in the blizzards and grinding sandstorms, which make much more vivid impressions"}

{"text":"Suprisingly, The Hunted with Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Toro is a serious crime drama. The martial art scenes are without special effects and appear to be based on real martial art moves and special operations training. Unlike most action thrillers, this crime drama takes itself seriously and the tracking skills presented in this movie by Tommy Lee Jones are consistently believeable. There isn't the usual buddy, buddy, lovey dovy stuff going on either. The primary focus is on the ironic position of an assassin trained by our government who takes his mission too seriously and his instructor who both provide an environmentalist, pacifist message and the search and seek and evade activities as one man attempts to stay alive while the government tries to kill him and the other man tries to prevent him from killing others. A fascinating look at crime drama from a different perspective, an above average movie for its genre and worth a look if one is interested in real martial arts and a movie that doesn't stray from its main plot with fluffy romantic interludes or special effects that defy reality."}
{"text":"RATING:\n\nstar55\n\nThis movie is pure art! Critics who pan this film as \"silly\" and \"sugary\" and viewers who see it as \"heartwarming\" or \"a tibute to music\" are missing the point. Only the reviewer who saw the movie as an example of \"magical realism\" (a la Garcia Marquez' Hundred Years of Solitude or Allende's House of Spirits) and the critic who thought the movie was \"prone to long shots of light sparkling off bright objects\" appoached the heart of the matter. The movie is a montage of visual shots and audio bites which express the delight and wonder of people caught up in a musical rapture. They are separated physically and emotionally by their own unique response to the stimulation of music, only to be reunited at the end by the commonality of music as a means of communication, which is at oncle individual and universal. In essence, August Rush is a metaphor for this emotional transfiguration sparked by music. It is a visual poem, and like a poem the meaning is in the connotation of the images, not in the story as such. Sure, the story line is trite and silly, and the acting is saccharine, but the movie as art demanded this approach. \"The medium is the message.\" I give this movie a standing ovation- and at 67 I am not easy to please!"}

{"text":"I know it's an easy play on the title, but The Lucky Ones are the folks in the theater next door to Neil Burger's heartfelt but deeply, deeply flawed drama about three Iraq soldiers on a bizarre road trip across America's heartland. Despite a heart that's clearly in the right place and three very good actors in the lead roles, The Lucky Ones can be easily discarded onto the pyre of failed Iraq War movies like Lions For Lambs, Rendition, In the Valley of Elah, Stop-Loss, and Redacted. Yes, The Lucky Ones is different, in that it's an Iraq War movie with barely any scenes in Iraq, but it falls victim to much of the same manipulative string-pulling that befell the other films about the conflict. The actors do everything they can to get out of the way of the overwritten, on-the-nose screenplay, but writers Neil Burger and Dirk Wittenborn steadfastly refuse to give them anything believable to work with in The Lucky Ones.\n\nThe Lucky Ones opens with the cocky T.K. (Michael Pena) in Iraq. His convoy gets hit and he takes a piece of shrapnel in the leg, rendering him impotent. When he gets home on leave, he's too embarrassed to tell his fianc\u00e9e about his little problem, so he decided to go to Vegas to get a sex worker to help him get it up again. In the airport, T.K. runs into a problem when all the flights are delayed due to an NYC blackout. That's when he meets two other Iraq vets, Cheever (Tim Robbins) and Colee (Rachel McAdams), the former finishing his tour of duty and the latter just home on break. The elder Cheever is going to surprise his wife at home in St. Louis (we all know how that goes in movies) while the super-sweet Colee plans to return the guitar of her deceased fellow soldier and lover to his family. Deciding to turn their airport delay into a mutually-beneficially cross-country caravan, Cheever rents a car and the road trip begins.\n\nThe preceding paragraph only gives you a glimpse of the clich\u00e9s at play in The Lucky Ones, and Burger and Wittenborn are nearly defiant in their refusal to make their script feel believable. It's not just a matter of too many coincidences or clich\u00e9s. When a screenplay requires a tornado, a Winnebago full of sex workers, and a legendary casino robbery to resolve itself, you might want to go back to the drawing board. It's as if Burger and Wittenborn knew that their set-up was a little far-fetched and decided to just go for broke from there. The second half of The Lucky Ones is so ridiculous that an alien invasion wouldn't have really shocked me.\n\nThe problem is - if The Lucky Ones isn't believable, it isn't anything. I suppose Burger could have gone to the other extreme and made a fairy tale of a movie, but they clearly want to pull emotional heartstrings. McAdams does the best work at that, making Colee a tough but fragile character and the only one who feels genuine. Robbins looks absolutely lost here and Pena isn't believable. They're both usually great actors but they can't break through the pablum.Only McAdams makes any headway there at all.\n\nThe faintest praise I can give The Lucky Ones is that I never despised it because its heart was always in the right place. Yes, real soldiers deserve better than this dreck, but the movie never feels like exploitation like some lesser Iraq movies have. I'm sure a lot of bad fiction has been written about veterans and current soldiers in the Iraq War. It's just not that often that it gets shot and projected on to a big screen."}

When Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, he made history for being the first openly gay man in American history to be voted into public office. But the rights of homosexuals weren't Milk's primary concern, as tellingly evidenced by the wide array of political coalitions he formed over the course of his tragically brief career. He fought for everyone from union workers to senior citizens, a true hero of human rights who possessed nothing but compassion for his fellow man. The story begins in New York City, where a 40-year-old Milk ponders what steps he can take to make his life more meaningful.\n\nEventually, Milk makes the decision to relocate to the West Coast, where he and his lover, Scott Smith (James Franco), found a small business in the heart of a working-class neighborhood. Empowered by his love for the Castro neighborhood and the success of his business, Castro Camera, Milk somewhat unexpectedly begins to emerge as an outspoken agent for change. With a growing support system that includes both Scott and a like-minded young activist named Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), the charismatic Milk decides to take a fateful leap into politics, eventually developing a reputation as a leader who isn't afraid to follow up his words with actions. In short order, he is elected supervisor for the newly zoned District 5, though this seeming triumph is in fact the catalyst for a tragedy that starts to unfold as Milk does his best to forge a political partnership with Dan White (Josh Brolin), another newly elected supervisor.

{"text":"When watching the brilliant The Man with a Movie Camera it is more likely than not that you will be saying something along those lines many times during the ~70 minute running time. The film has no actual plot and consists of random scenes filmed without actors, script, sets or anything resembling a normal film and that is exactly why it is such a riveting watch. Essentially it's two men documenting everyday life\u2026\n\nI should begin this review by saying that I'm not a huge Muppets fan. I've seen the original movie and at least one of the other ones, but I saw them when I was so young that I don't have much memory of them. However, my dad played the soundtrack to The Muppet Movie a lot so I am very familiar with the songs that reappeared on this film.\n\nIn short, The Man with a Movie Camera is mandatory for everyone plaining to be a filmmaker.\n\nI have this film here for months but I was afraid of watching it.

I couldn't get up from my chair for one single\u2026\n\nUnfortunately I failed to click with this film, which is not only considered a masterpiece but which is a favourite of several people on this site who have excellent taste.\n\nI didn't used to expect much enjoyment from \"avant-garde\" or \"experimental\" films when I first approached them but increasingly often I find they contain ideas or characters or triggers for memories which give me a strong personal connection with them. I think that having done meditation also helps.\n\nOpened up Woodstock to watch, four hours long, closed that bad boy and yelled next, Man with a movie Camera, 70 minutes long, I think I can manage that tonight. I have been excited to see this for so long now, an experimental avant-garde documentary that is regarded as a cornerstone of cinema by nearly everyone who has seen it. Which also intimidates.

Simply put, The Man with a Movie Camera is like nothing I've ever seen, and will likely never see again.\n\nI can not begin to imagine living in 1929 and watching this movie. It's so experimental and technically innovative; I imagine every viewer in its time walked out of the cinema with their jaws on the ground.\n\nIt's widely told that Godard established the jump cut in \"Breathless\" but this is untrue because practically every cut in this IS a jump cut. Furthermore, this is only one of many\u2026\n\nI see it as a love letter to movies written many years before many of our favorite movies would ever be made.

The obvious segues into overblown hysteria are avoided for the most part and the whole affair is not too distasteful.\n\nBased on the autobiographical novel by Susanna Kayson chronicling her time spent in a mental institution following a suicide attempt, Girl, Interrupted is not quite what you'd expect; namely \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest For Chicks\". It's true that the story is dominated by Jolie's Oscar winning turn as the rebelliously anti-social yet charismatic Lisa, but the story is a lot more sympathetic towards the staff of the hospital and what they were trying to do. The cast of likeable weirdos make for an engaging bunch of misfits which makes up for the fact that it lacks any real kind of power or emotional resonance and it's nicely non-judgemental when it comes to the depiction of both the inmates and the staff who are genuinely trying to help them. Hardly the most challenging portrait of mental illness but enjoyable none the less.\n\nSusanna Kaysen: Because you're dead already, Lisa! No one cares if you die, Lisa because you're dead already.

{"text":"'People Like Us' is worth watching\n\n-- Cooperstown Crier\n\n---- \u2014 Probably the worst place you can watch a movie is in an airplane. The picture is bad, the sound is bad and usually the movie is bad as well. Even if it's one that you want to see, the sound is garbled and you inevitably have a seat where you suffer a pinched nerve from having to crane your neck. It's the perfect trifecta and then some. How many people actually look forward to watching an in-flight movie?\n\nI mention this phenomenon because I had an unusual experience on a flight recently. I actually saw a film that wasn't half-bad despite all the drawbacks. It didn't hurt that I had an unplanned aisle seat when I normally take a window. It's one of those unexplained situations, possibly due to the airline changing the aircraft, where you don't end up with the seat you request.\n\nOne advantage to the aisle seat is that you have a more direct view of the screen rather than the angled view of the window seat which equates to looking at a battery operated TV on the beach with the glare of the sun. It helps if the screen (which the airplane has every five rows) is in the row in front of you.\n\nOtherwise you might need binoculars. Fortunately I was in the perfect position. So far, so good.\n\nThe movie in question was one I probably saw previews of but made no impression on me. It was called \"People Like Us\" and from the description in the in-flight magazine sounded like it had promise.\n\nInspired by a \"true\" story (I assume that means that 10 percent of the story actually happened), a young man with business problems returns home for his estranged father's funeral and to take care of his effects. It is there that he discovers he has a sister he never knew about.\n\nTo understand why I was intrigued by this plot line you must remember I was on a six-hour flight and thought a half-decent film might be a nice break from reading and crossword puzzles. Chatting with your neighbor is out these days because they're either sleeping or playing games on their smartphone.\n\nConsidering my options, how one reacts to discovering he has a 30-year-old sister suddenly provided some fascination on a long flight.\n\nThere are four main characters in the film, three adults and one kid. The kid was a newbie but the adults looked familiar. One I eventually recognized as an older Michelle Pfeiffer but the other two I later had to look up on Wikipedia. The guy returning for the funeral is Chris Pine, the young Jim Kirk in the latest Star Trek films, and his mom is played by the still gorgeous Pfeiffer. You discover very quickly how dysfunctional the family is when Pfeiffer greets Pine by slapping his face. No wonder Pine's character doesn't want to be there.\n\nWhen Pine discovers he has a half-sister (played by Elizabeth Banks) due to an affair his estranged father had he thinks even worse of him. He tells his girlfriend that the only \"good\" memory of his dad is his taking him to the playground as a kid, but even then his father would retreat to his car to work on his professional music writings. Pine has absolutely no use for him.\n\nWhen Pine finds out he has a sister, who has no idea she has a brother, he seeks her out without telling her that he's her brother. It turns out she has a dysfunctional life and is raising a dysfunctional son as a single, dysfunctional mom. By this time I'm beginning to wonder if the film is becoming too dysfunctional for my tastes.\n\nIt becomes even more frustrating after Pine and Banks eventually become friends because you're left wondering why Pine's character just doesn't tell Banks that they're related. I assume it's because by doing such a logical thing there would be no plot to exploit and the story would take only five minutes instead of two hours. Perhaps in the real life story he told her right away. If so, the movie sounds like a prime example of artistic license on steroids.\n\nThe funny thing after all this criticism is that I give \"People Like Us\" a thumb's up. If you can deal with the corny scenes and the lack of common sense, the ending makes up for everything and then some.\n\nIt has a twist to it that I didn't see coming that turns what appeared to be another typical Hollywood dysfunctional theme movie into something worth watching.\n\nNot by coincidence we have the DVD of the movie in-house. If I can put up with what appeared to be a weak plot line with poor sound quality on a small screen and still come out impressed there must be something to it. The movie made my flight and that's not an easy thing to do.\n\nDavid Kent is the director of the Village Library of Cooperstown. He can be reached at co.david@4cls.org."}
{"text":"Les Femmes du 6eme Etage (Women of the 6th Floor\/ Service Entrance)\n\n(France, 2011, d. Philippe Le Guay) (COMPETITION)\n\nNational and cultural identity is a concern in 21st century Europe. Who are all these migrants? Where do they come from? What are they doing here? Is it just economic migration? Does it threaten the national culture? According to this entertaining comedy, the questions have been round for a long time. In fact, in France, 1962, there was a huge influx of Spanish maids.\nThis comedy (like Almanya - Welcome to Germany, concerning Turks and Germans) is an entertaining and often telling way to make a point about migrants and their being welcomed or not and their trying to live within a different culture.\n\nFabrice Luchini tends to take serious roles, often villains in historical pieces. Here he is effective as a comedian, but mainly in his reactions to what is going on around him, often a performance of double takes. He is a financial adviser who has lived in his apartment all his life, inheriting his company from his father. He has an ambitious socialite wife (Sandrine Kiberlain) and two insufferable young sons. He has a maid who has worked for 25 years with the family. When she leaves, his wife takes her friends' advice to employ a Spanish maid, Maria (Natalia Verbeke) and you know the scene is set for his loosening up, even falling in love, his becoming more Spanish as he gets to know all the Spanish maids who live on his top floor, and his wife getting her comeuppance.\n\nIt is generally bright and breezy, the group of older maids (moving out of Franco's Spain, so providing a subtext for the film) are a lively and devout lot and Maria, of course, has a secret. While it does work out, on the whole, as we might expect, it is the funny moments, the sentimental moments (and the satirical moments at the expense of gossiping Parisian women) that carry it along as an entertainment and as a film with a cultural message,"}

{"text":"Columbia Pictures has asked critics not to offer up anything in their reviews that could be construed as a spoiler. I can understand this. If I told the film's secrets\u2014by which I mean those not telegraphed by the trailer\u2014and you believed me (a prospect I find unlikely), you'd probably burst out laughing. What could the studio do to me if I did spill the beans? Make me sit through the damned thing again? Well, I'm not risking that, so all I'm saying here is that Seven Pounds manages the not inconsiderable feat of being both painfully predictable and preposterous to the point of being demented. Put it this way: When you see how things have to go and you start to slip into \"Oh, no, they couldn't possibly\" mode, disabuse yourself of that disbelief. They not only can, but they will.\n\nI honestly think that those responsible for Seven Pounds believe the movie is a lot more mysterious than it is. I knew from the trailer that Will Smith was playing a tormented man who has the ability to help out other people, which he seems to be doing to expiate his guilt over something bad he did. The trailer also made it pretty clear that he's rather choosy about whom he helps. And while he doesn't want to become emotionally involved with them, he will do just that with at least one, and that's all planned to be capped off by Smith shuffling off his mortal coil. If the idea was to surprise or shock via those elements, it didn't work. OK, I knew nothing of the bad thing Smith had done, though I had it pegged by the 20-minute mark. There's also an aspect of what he's up to that is partly surprising, a couple of minor details that aren't immediately obvious\u2014and then there's the jellyfish. Yes, I said jellyfish.\n\nSmith plays an IRS agent named Ben Thomas. We first meet him in a sleazy motel room where he's calling 911 to report a suicide\u2014his own. At this point the film flashes back to the events that brought him to this moment. The film then\u2014because this is like art, you know\u2014jumps around in a willy-nilly fashion showing Ben engaging in various mysterious activities and behaving in what former sitcom writer Grant Nieporte thinks is irrational behavior, which it might be if we couldn't clearly see where this is going. Why does he abuse blind, vegan meat telemarketer Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson) over the phone? Why does he hang around a hospital scoping out (it'd be called stalking if he weren't Will Smith) Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), the hapless girl with the rare blood type who owes $56,000 in back taxes and needs a heart transplant? Is this standard IRS agent protocol? If you can't figure this out, you need to see more contrived movies.\n\nWhen Ben isn't involved in odd activities, he spends a lot of time sulking in his palatial beach house with his pet CGI box jellyfish (\"the deadliest creature in the world,\" Ben tells us in a childhood-memory flashback). At least that's what he does until he starts putting his plan into action, whereupon he packs up his jellyfish and moves to the sleazy motel. The jellyfish, by the way, has no name, but then neither does fourth-billed Michael Ealy as \"Ben's Brother,\" so I guess that's fair. In any case, rampant melodrama of the most manipulative kind finally leads us back to that 911 call.\n\nThe aim is multiple-handkerchief weeping. The hope is that viewers won't examine the amassed illogical plot points too closely. Those who shed copious tears will accuse those of us who find it all tedious and phony of \"thinking too much.\" It will be last year's The Bucket List all over again. The public's love affair with Will Smith will probably carry the day at the box office, even if this isn't one of his better performances (looking like you're suffering from intestinal cramping isn't a good substitute for angst). Some of us will spend years trying to get the sound of an elementary-school chorus singing Herman's Hermits' \"I'm Into Something Good\" out of our heads, while wondering if we can ever look a jellyfish in the tentacle again. The world will go on. Rated PG-13 for thematic material, some disturbing content and a scene of sensuality\u2026\nMaybe you could try to watch a movie without first looking at the trailer, and waiting for those moments, and analyzing them\u2026 Just try to discover the movie from the beginning to the end.\nYes it is obvious what's gong to happen, but this movie isn't like The Game, where the point of watching is to figure it out.\nThis movie is meant to make you feel something, obviously you aren't the target audience, something is missing inside you. Stick to the cartoons, or sherlock movies, where your brilliant intellect could shine.\n\np.s. Sorry to break this to you, one more time, (i don't think you \"got it\" the first time)...

Smith) was actually impersonating him\u2026\n\nGee, son, did you miss the first sentence of this review\u2026in which Mr. Hanke states that Colombia Pictures has demanded that critics avoid spoilers in their reviews?\n\nThis movie is meant to make you feel something, obviously you aren't the target audience, something is missing inside you.\n\nI don't follow your logic: Mr. Hanke doesn't like the film; ergo, he lacks humanity? If Rotten Tomatoes is any judge, 72 percent of critics are \"missing something inside\".\n\nStick to the cartoons, or sherlock movies, where your brilliant intellect could shine.\n\nPerhaps you, in turn, should stick to elementary-school playgrounds, where your insults might be considered witty.\n\nSean Williams\n\nDec 23, 2008 at\n\nMaybe you could try to watch a movie without first looking at the trailer\n\nThat's a patently absurd suggestion. The studios go out of their way to get you to see these things. They even cut deals to be sure their trailer gets on certain movies.\n\nJust try to discover the movie from the beginning to the end.\n\nSo I should never see trailers, ignore the studio's publicity altogether? Tell me, do you just walk into a theater with no idea what you're seeing or what it's about?\n\nYes it is obvious what's gong to happen, but this movie isn't like The Game, where the point of watching is to figure it out.\n\nWell, that's obviously not 100% true or the studio wouldn't be asking reviewers not to give anything away. Moreover, this is a movie built around a mystery style plot (Why is he doing this? Why is he behaving in this manner? What is the horrible thing he did in the past?) and put together in a jigsaw puzzle fashion. It very much is designed for the viewer to try to figure out what's going on. Are you suggesting that you're supposed to be an utterly passive viewer who doesn't think about what's going on on the screen? Were you completely incurious on these points?\n\nThis movie is meant to make you feel something, obviously you aren't the target audience, something is missing inside you\n\nOh, yes, it's always the fault of the reviewer. It's never the fault of the movie, nor is it simply a difference of opinion. In the case of Seven Pounds there must be something missing inside an awful lot of critics, since out of 129 reviews catalogued on Rotten Tomatoes, 92 of the reviews are bad ones.\n\nlook, all the people who dont resect a good film when they see when are obviously the people bashing the film. this movie was not as predictable as ALL these \"professional critics\" seem to be saying..(haha professionals..yea right) it was very deep, and emotianal. will smith is going to go down as a legend after ..he already is ;] and will go down as greatness. i loved the movie, and i wish more films were as deep, powerful, and yes suprising!\n\njenna\n\nDec 31, 2008 at\n\nlook, all the people who dont resect a good film when they see when are obviously the people bashing the film.\n\nOh my gosh, Hanke's reviews and the comments that follow just make my day! I laughed out loud when I read, \"Is that English?\" because I had just finished scratching my head over jenna's comment.\n\nMy mom just called and said I had to see this film. I love her, but I'll follow Hanke's lead when it comes to films. I LOVED Slumdog Millionaire and now know that I would go see that movie again over this latest Will Smith offering. (And I like him! I really do! I keep meaning to see Six Degrees of Separation again - because that's the first film I ever saw him in and thought, \"That's the Fresh Prince? I can't wait to see more from him!\" Unfortunately I haven't seen him in anything like that since.) Keep up the good work, Mr. Hanke. You so often make my day with your reviews!\n\nstacey\n\nJan 01, 2009 at\n\nThank you.\n\nThing is I don't dislike Will Smith, but I don't tend to much care for the movies he's in. The major exception is Six Degrees, but in that I haven't seen it since the '90s, don't hold me to that. I did find Hitch a pleasant diversion.\n\nThis movie is giving many clues in the whole process, instead of covering it up so tight till the ending moment. Shattered scenes and dialogues and leading you to solve the mystery. So mystery is a part of the movie, uncovering it is another, the romance and help and touching part is the gist. If you solve the mystery throughout the movie, congrats, you're a normal person. If you don't like knowing what happens in a mystery until the end, go watch Detective Konan(Case Closed), that suits you.\nYou took out all the good things I see in the movie, the message it's trying to deliver, the acting of Will Smith, the creative plot(something you might disagree, but honestly I'm tired of 007 and batman).\nAnd basically the stuff you're complaining about, is not a big deal anyway.\nHighly illogical plot. Man Will Smith is a stalker, how did he get into that hospital? He must be caught or something!\nCare less about these minor stuff man. Not much stories are without these.\n\nBilly\n\nJan 02, 2009 at\n\nhonestly I'm tired of 007 and batman\n\nYou're no more tired of them than I am\u2014possibly less so\u2014but Seven Pounds and its incredibly silly plotting is hardly much of a substitute, nor is it the only alternative to Batman and James Bond. There's a wide world of actual good movies out there. What may not be a \"big deal\" to you\u2014a jellyfish?\u2014may strike someone else as a stumbling block of such Everest-like proportions that whatever thematic merit was in the film gets lost.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014About your critic, I agree some of the whole story can be predicted early, but it doesn't strike out the movie, since from that on suspense turns well into drama. It's a movie made to be at most enjoyed, not decyphrated.\n\nSorry about eventually write mistakes, english isn't my primary language. I hope it's readable to US public to contribute with the discussion.\n\nndal\n\nJan 04, 2009 atWell, yes it does make sense in that I do not tell you how these things come into play.\n\nAbout your critic, I agree some of the whole story can be predicted early, but it doesn't strike out the movie, since from that on suspense turns well into drama.\n\nIt may for you. It turns into ever-increasing preposterous silliness for me.\n\nIt's a movie made to be at most enjoyed, not decyphrated.\n\nAssuming that \"decyphrated\" is meant to mean deciphered, I don't get your point\u2014unless this is a variant on the tired accusation that the critic is \"thinking too much,\" which always strikes me as a lazy accusation that insists you need to become as stupid as the movie you're watching. I might see the point to the idea if we were talking about a dumb teen sex comedy, but we're not. We're talking about a movie that paints itself as some kind of serious and meaningful drama complete with life lessons, but ends up with a jellyfish wrapped in a sub-Tarantino jigsaw structure.\n\nLook people, there's one thing to love Will Smith (I kinda like the guy) and another thing to think this is a good movie. This is an overall horrible movie. Look past the tear jerker- I think I shed one- and look into the story or lack thereof. This movie can be seen as unpredictable, but like the critic said by that time why do you care? Why is all this time spent on a supposedly intense relationship between Ben\/Tim and Emily, but it doesn't even seem like they know anything about each other? They rarely talk or at least it's not shown on screen. Then you have these 7 people who we're told he helped, but you leave the theatre not even remembering all of them. So why were the 7 even important? They could have had 1 (cause it seems like they did) and had a story. Well maybe the blind guy could have made a cameo. The problem with this movie is it doesn't make you understand the 7 situations and why they are important. Instead it barely goes into detail about 1 and spends half the movie on it. There's a difference in being a suspense movie and just plain leaving things out. See the difference people! Oh and good acting or not a movie should be able to understand. Will Smith's acting can't make the movie\u2026\n\nD. Alyse\n\nJan 06, 2009 at\n\nLook past the tear jerker- I think I shed one\n\nI did, too, come to that (which puts it one tear up on Benjamin Button for me)\u2014the moment where Rosario Dawson is overcome by him having fixed her printing press. I put this down entirely to Dawson's performance, by the way.\n\nThen you have these 7 people who we're told he helped, but you leave the theatre not even remembering all of them\n\nI can come up with six if I work at it, but I had to work at it. I'm still not clear how giving someone a house that couldn't even begin to pay the property taxes on is quite the act of largesse it's portrayed as.\n\nSaw this movie about a week ago. This review seems to be essentially spot on in most ways to me. The big problem for me was that it started in such a disjointed and difficult to follow fashion that it essentially forced me to start thinking analytically to simply figure out what was going on. Unfortunately, the movie just falls apart once the pieces begin to fit together. The movie just isn't clever enough to avoid telegraphing its intentions which ultimately ruins any impact an event would have. By the time we actually get to the \"tear jerking conclusion\" it's emotionless as we've been reacting to it for atleast the past 30 minutes.\n\nAaron\n\nJan 07, 2009 at\n\nI'm going to have to side with TimThomas on this one. Giving away the brother's name would be a plot spoiler, but you explicitly stated that he had no name. The spoiler excuse was a good attempt though.\nAnd using a RottenTomatoes rating as some sort of authority on what is and isn't a good movie? Movies aren't decided by voting contests. I've seen plenty of good movies receive much lower ratings than they deserve while terrible movies (Tropic Thunder, for instance) get lauded. I sense some flawed reasoning here.\n\nBEN\n\nJan 07, 2009 at\n\nI'm going to have to side with TimThomas on this one. Giving away the brother's name would be a plot spoiler, but you explicitly stated that he had no name.\n\nNo, I explicitly stated that he's billed in the credits as \"Ben's Brother.\"\n\nAnd using a RottenTomatoes rating as some sort of authority on what is and isn't a good movie?\n\nNo, I used it simply to point out that a significant portion of the critical populace must, by \"Tim's\" comments be as lacking in humanity as I apparently am for not boo-hoo-hooing over this movie's assaults on the tear ducts.\n\noh thank you for this review. I went into this movie expecting a deep an engaging mystery and hey some good old fashion Will Smithness. Sadly I got nothing. To those trying to say that this movie is deep. No. It is not. It's predictable and annoyingly angsty. I personaly love dark movies but there is a difference between an actual good movie that shows us human difficulties and 'Truths' and movies like this crap-pile that are just trying to tug at your heartstrings and make you feel as though you've been to a 'smart people movie.'\n\nBottom line, if you want something deep and beautiful go to some of the good films that are out right now. Why see this crap when Slumdog Millionare is playing?\n\nKristi\n\nJan 11, 2009"}
{"text":"What It's About:\n\nIn the all-too-near future, Drs. Dave Bowman and Frank Poole (Dullea and Lockwood) are traveling towards Jupiter on-board space vessel \"Discovery\", equipped with the new HAL 9000 computer. Though it's presumed that whatever man creates he can control, HAL will put that theory to the test, bringing significant danger to the astronauts from a source they could never have anticipated.\n\nWhy I Love It:\n\nThis brief synopsis only begins to describe this most cosmic, dense and challenging of science fiction films, which director Kubrick co-wrote with sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke. Notably, \"2001\" relies on images more than words to convey its multi-layered tale, which starts with the dawn of man. Profound and cerebral, the film may feel slow and ponderous to those accustomed to \"Star Wars\", and occasionally, its vision of the near future betrays its 1968 origins. Still, the mind-blowing \"2001\" stands as a work of genius, from a brilliant director working at the top of his game."}
{"text":"Pages\n\n6.11.2012\n\nMovie: Django Unchained\n\nI can't wait for Quentin Tarantino's new film Django Unchained to come out. Tarantino has been making movies right up my alley for a while now. I have an undergraduate degree in History with a focus on African American history, women's history, and Nazi germany. So any movie that deals with these subjects just draws me right in.\n\nHere's a little info:\n\nDjango Unchained is set in the Deep South, and follows Django (Foxx), a freed slave who treks across America with Dr. King Schultz (Waltz), a German dentist turned bounty hunter. Together, they try to retrieve Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the charming but sadistic Francophile plantation owner Calvin Candie (DiCaprio) and his band of ruthless slavers."}
{"text":"Yeah, or rereading it, a simpler way of summing it up might be that it's a story about an imaginary starlet realizing that her real spiritual\/psychic source is a common hooker, the movie being a gradual trajectory of the two halves coming together, dream and reality; and all the violence that entails along the way. To embrace reality -- appealing or not -- the illusions must die. But it isn't malicious or actual. It's the only way to break free of the hypnosis perpetrated by the \"cursed script\" and illusion-makers. It takes the pained reality of Susan's actual self and actual life to murder Nikki (thus kind of freeing her), but it takes the acceptance of that and subsequent decision of Nikki to break similarly free of her Hollywood Masters and embrace the hurt woman she's fed such glamorous dreams to in order to complete the liberation from the whole weird paradigm. (As the freaky old woman says, \"there are bills unpaid\" or something to that effect, maybe just an echo of a common sentiment in her real life, I dunno.) Since the feelings that give spawn to a Nikki are genuine and innocent and mean the most to a woman like Susan, it'd make a sort of sense that ultimately it is Susan that Nikki really belongs to and needs to be one with; not the director, and not the mysterious man she kills at the end. Then Susan can in turn give herself wholly to her husband and child. It's all kind of surprisingly feministic and vaguely condescending at the same time, in a weird way.\n\nWhat else while I'm killing time here, hmm. The rabbit room functions like a sitcom that doesn't make any sense, replete with laugh-track. It seems to be green or red, depending; perhaps the red portions parallel the points at which unpleasant realities are shifting back into focus, e.g. the illegitimate child. But I'm not sure. A sitcom gives us a sense of comfort and normality -- unlike a melodramatic romance at the heart of the story initially, which sweeps us away in emotional ideals of love and lust, etc. It's a human version of the male rabbit -- the pudgy dude in the crooked glasses -- that Nikki gradually confesses her true nature to, or the dark side of her nature at any rate. \"They said maybe you can help me,\" I think she tells him at first.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the \"real\" Susan that Nikki eventually unifies with at whatever key moment in the hotel is staring into a television every time we see her.\n\nWhat's all that mean? I don't know, but I feel like some sort of sense could be made of it. Maybe.\n\nOriginally posted by madget: And as I alluded to at the beginning, Inland Empire has to be the first movie in which a lamp has made me just about jump out of my seat.\n\nIf that's the same scary lamp as I'm thinking of,* that's also a great example of Lynch's use of visuals and, especially, sound.\n\nI think he's technically and formally one of the best directors out there, in terms of evoking (as you say) nightmares, and at creating just plain scary scenes. Even though I didn't know exactly what was going on in terms of plot, his scenes still cause dread and suspense. I think it takes a director who really knows his craft to be able to that.\n\n* \"If that's the same scary lamp as I'm thinking of\". Ah, the things you end up writing when discussing a Lynch film.\n\nAmerican Gangster: Denzel Washington is great as Frank Lucas, a heroin dealer who made ridiculous amounts of money during the Viet Nam era. Russell Crowe is good as the cop who eventually caught him, but in his case it helps a lot that the guy he plays was really interesting in real life. There is some fun stuff involving corrupt cops from New York who like to mess with both of the lead actors.\n\nRecommended.\n\nThe Amateurs: Jeff Bridges heads up a great ensemble cast featuring Valerie Perrine, Judy Greer and a bunch of underrated character actors in a movie that... isn't as good as it should have been. The basic idea is that a bunch of lovable losers decide to make a porn movie and things don't go according to plan. Some of the dialogue is pretty funny, but overall it doesn't live up to its potential. The ending is pretty good, though.\n\nIf you liked The Big Lebowski, it's sort of what you might get if The Dude actually tried to better himself instead of just abiding.\n\nRecommended. Even though it could use more lesbians.\n\nDarjeeling Limited: I'm glad I finally saw this, because I had been wondering if it was any good for a long time. But... I found it really disappointing. The funny bits couldn't make up for the stuff that just seemed pointless and\/or boring.\n\nSo... I finally rented Walk Hard. I'm really glad I waited to see the director's cut, because most of my favorite scenes aren't even in the theatrical version.\n\nAll the extra sex and nudity helps too.\n\nSome of the cuts in the theatrical release make no sense. For example, the \"Negro Man\" sequence (the part where the Hasidic Jews come to see him play) originally had a bunch of stuff with Dewey (John C. Reilly) playing piano like Jerry Lee Lewis and playing a guitar solo. It's a fun scene and it's only a couple of minutes long. They should have just left that in since they kept most of the over-the-top dancing.\n\nAt another point, they cut out a scene where Dewey talks to his brother's ghost that they definitely needed for story reasons. If nothing else, it helps a scene with the ghost later make a lot more sense. Again, it was only about two minutes long. Even after listening to the commentary, I don't really get their thought process.\n\nI rented Gamers because the ad copy on the box made it sound like it was a brilliant comedy about five Dungeons and Dragons nerds. Also, they somehow got Kelly LeBrock and William Katt to be in it. The blurbs from reviews on gaming sites just added to the ironic appeal.\n\nIt's really stupid. There are funny bits occasionally that you'll appreciate more if you have either been a gamer yourself or have tried hanging out with gamers. But it's basically what you might get if somebody tried to turn the webcomic Penny Arcade into a live-action movie.\n\n... which is great if you can enjoy stuff like the running gag about the guy from Argentina collecting horse semen for a living, or the multiple versions of a children's song written by the DM called \"I Love Dick.\"\n\nIf you can't, there's not really much point in waiting to see if it ever gets better.\n\nIt does, finally, but between bad attempts at having dramatic arcs and how obvious it is that they didn't have much money to work with it's really rough going.\n\nEven after listening to the commentary, I don't really get their thought process.\n\nI figure the thought processes of most Hollywonk directors is usually soaked in coke of the cane.\n\nI've seen them make the same mistakes of omission dozens of times, and always with the same lame audio commentary excuse of \"we found that it just slowed down the flow, man.\"\n\nBullshit! A minute added here or there doesn't slow down anything, you stupid MTV-brainwashed twits! They have no clue what the hell a flow is - look at any great classic movie, and you'll see tons of pace-relaxing moments, as well as atmosphere and exposition-laden moments, all vital to the overall piece.\n\nThat's what makes your contrast, which gives the thing depth and full dimension. That's why artists use dark as well as light lines, or musicians mix up their sets with slower ballads among the hard rocking bits.\n\nBut no, these dumb kids all want to go for the bad Spielberg 1941 dogma of \"action quickly followed by action\" instead, and so we get all these crappy, \"too much in a hurry to end\" movies.\n\nI swear that 9 times out of 10 their \"deleted scenes\" are better than any of the junk they left IN the film! (The wedding Planner is a good example.)\n\nWhat these punks need to do is go into some other business, where their drug-addled little greed-oriented minds would be welcome - like politics!"}
{"text":"Sunday, March 28, 2010\n\nCLASSIC MOVIE REVIEWS\n\nLAWRENCE OF ARABIA\n\nSir Peter O'Toole gets captured and then tortured in the desert. Other key events in this long movie are: the conquest of the Port of Aqaba, the fall of Damascus, Turks, Sheiks, burning matches that set the sun on fire. Lawrence is a cartographer, which is a person who is sexually attracted to maps. Lawrence is in love with his friend Sherif Ali so he is gay for men too, but sadly the homophobic Turks won't let them be in love. What else? It's four hours long. Better to watch Clash of the Titans starring Sir Lawrence Olivier instead, because it's shorter yet still explores all these same historical events and has Medusa, Calibus, the Kracken, and Pegasus (gay horse!). 1 star, for the exceptionally bloody massacre at Tafras.\n\n\"Is there no place where two men can roll around together on top of a sexy map in this homophobic desert?\" \"\n\n\"In MY movie you can get it on wherever you damned well please. I'll even place your mortal action figures smack down in the middle of the coliseum on my own sexy map.\"\n\nBLADE RUNNER\/ SCHINDLER'S LIST DOUBLE REVIEW\n\nThese movies are so similar that I created this review on dialogue alone. Compare this line from Blade Runner: Taffey Lewis: \"Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one one the house, OK?\" With this line from \"Schindler's List\": Oscar Schindler: \"Why do you drink that motor oil? I send you good stuff all the time. Let me get you some wine for the Sabbath\". Blade runner... Deckerd: \"I have had people walk out on me before, but not when I was being so charming.\" Schindlers List... Oscar Shindler:\"I could try to read this, or I could eat my lunch while it's still hot.\"\n\nThis badass saved many many Jewish people from the gas chambers by giving the SS chocolate bars. (He had some other tricks up his sleeve but the chocolate strategy is my personal favorite)\n\nMaybe Schindler is more heroic, but Rutger Hauer is in Deckerd's movie\n\nBoth of these movies main characters are sassy detectives trying to overthrow apocalyptic tyrants. Blade Runner gets 4 stars and Schindler 3- one star off for not having Rutger Hauer in it. He was born to play a Nazi. Ralph Fiennes is Irish or something.\n\nTHE GODFATHER\n\nThis film is about a family of Mafiosos. The Godfather is a Marlon Brando, who in the movie is Don Corleone and head mafia man. Everybody constantly goes to him for favors. I completely relate to this. Sometimes I feel like everyone wants something from me and they are just lined up at my door, one, after another, after another. And I just want to push them over like dominoes and watch them all fall down, down down... and then I can just take a long bath and then dance around to my 2 favorite song (\"Top of the World\" by the Carpenters and \"Colt 45\" by Afroman). 2 chopped horse heads.\n\n\"Here's a quarter, go call someone who gives a fuck\".\n\nON GOLDEN POND\n\nThis is good. I wish all the young people would go away in this so I could just watch Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda living in tranquil senility without that stupid kid. I want to live on Golden Pond. I love when Katherine Hepburn goes \"Remember when we used to skinny dip?\" and Henry Fonda is like, \"What? I can't hear you\". 5 stars!!! I can't hear about skinny dipping either because I'm against it- it's always cold and you can't have proper sex in water.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\n\nThis movie was like being transported back in time to when I was twenty six years old, a taxi driver, living in a one room cold water flat and I was sick of the filthy, filthy city streets and the pimps and the criminals and the garbage and the dirty politicians. Robert Deniro is so good in this. He has a jacket that has a gun that pop's out of the sleeve, knives that shoot out of his mohawk, lazers that shoot out of his eyes. He talks to himself in the mirror a lot, which is something I do all the time. He saves a young prostitute by killing her pimp and then there's a ticker-tape parade. What else...he takes this lady on their first date to a porno movie and then gives her a Kris Kristofferson album(?) That is my dream date so this movie get's 8 stars!\n\nThis woman below could have bagged the most romantic guy in NYC, who would have serenaded her with Kristoffersons \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\" while watching \"Kitty Going Down in the Valley\" at the Times Square Marquee. Give your rose to someone who deserves it Travis.\n\nTHE EXORCIST\n\nIn this movie a young girl is possessed by the evil spirit of Ronald Reagan. There is some very sacrilegious stuff going on here like crosses in vagina's and a lot of blasphemy. Don't watch this if you think Ronald Reagan is the greatest president ever, because it will skew your opinion of him. Also don't watch it if you pray to the cross of the Lord because it gets put into Ronald Reagan's vagina. I have warned you! I thought this movie was pretty excellent but my favorite president was Benjamin Franklin, so therefore this film didn't bother me much at all. If the main character was a demonic Benjamin Franklin, than I would boycott this film because that brilliant man invented the post office, the fire department, the stove, the lighting rod, chewing gum, duct tape, the fountain pen, the blender, and condoms. Look it up. No demon would ever make those awesome things. 4 satanic stars.\n\nRonald Reagan being impeached during the exorcism\n\nAMADEUS\n\nI saw this when I was a kid and it made a major impact on me. It is the tragic tale of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a brilliant, eccentric composer from long long ago. Manipulated by a bitter mediocre contemporary named Saliari, Mozart's career is ruined and he ends up destitute, in a mass grave covered in baking flour. Mozart liked farting, having sex with girls, making music, and candy. Just like all musical geniuses. Saliari is a true hater who manipulates Mozart employing cunning means, such as bringing him whores and chocolate (The Schindler technique). Who could resist those things? If Mozart had been deaf, as in Beethoven's case, he would never have heard Saliari's misleading suggestions. And if he was blind like Ray Charles he never would have seen Saliari dressed up in a Darth Vader outfit, pretending to be his dead Father's ghost. Then he would have gone on farting and making awesome music. 3 tragic whore-less candy-less fartless stars.\n\nMozart pre- Salieri.\n\nLater on, a fartless Mozart has lost his will to live.\n\nAPOCALYPSE NOW\n\nMarlon Brando is Colonel Kurtz, a vitiligo faced jungle warrior poet in the middle of Vietnam woods with natives who think he's a Jesus. Martin Sheen plays a guy who breaks mirrors with fists and is sent on a mission to take Kurtz down. Personally I liked this movie for two reasons: lot's of spider monkeys, and this line: \" I'm going 75 clicks above the Do-Lung bridge\". Whatever that means I don't know, but one day I will declare this in a conversation with my Mom and Dad. 5 clicks!\n\nCato the Elder\n\nHe told everybody Rome was gonna decline but everybody was like \"Will you please just shut the fuck up for once in your life\". Look who's laughing now? Me and Cato. (He might look like he's frowning but that's how people laughed in the old days)\n\nMisc websites\n\nETSY: Because of Etsy I can now knit an a adorable\/useless extension cord. I've also learned that by applying googly eyes to virtually anything you can sell it for...let's just say 'you can sell it\" and leave it at that."}
{"text":"Some stick more than others. Some, you just finish the film and let them go. Films like the ones I just mentioned, those four films won't ever leave me \u2014 the characters or the experiences. Like I still recite the poem \"Bright Star\" in my head at least a couple times a week. Sometimes more, even. I don't know why that's so deeply ingrained within me. I think when you invest that much into something, artistically or creatively, there's this connection to it that never goes away.\n\nI think we had discussions about it. To not judge Ashley, to let her be. It's not about popularity with her, it wasn't about how we show this woman in a way that's likeable. Not just that she's cranky, she messes up, and she's just not a very good person. That's who she is. It doesn't mean she's a bad person at the core of herself, she's just not connected to that core. There's so many levels of this film that are political and spiritual, but for me the beauty of the film in regards to Ashley's character was the journey into her life. The letting go. You see that moment you talked about, that moment that's hope, that's light"}
{"text":"Stardust may be the first movie I've watched that made me feel it was consciously aspiring to be The Princess Bride. This is interesting to me because I always thought Bride would remain one of those cult sleepers with a rabid but relatively small following. Now, 20 years later, its reputation stands well enough to be the inspiration for a certain flavor of fantasy, in direct opposition to the more serious one recently established by The Lord of the Rings, or even The Chronicles of Narnia movie.\n\nIn other words, Stardust, like The Princess Bride, is comfortable with winking. Each movie is ok with letting the audience know it is what it is -- a story being told. But Stardust doesn't use the device of actually showing someone reading to a kid; instead, it works the tone into the characters themselves, as they're prone to speak with a lot of sarcasm, or their morbid fates are treated with some bit of humor, which is actually a harder tactic to pull off -- the genius of Bride's framing device lies in allowing much of the winking to occur outside the realm of the actual fairy tale; that is, within the story, its characters are allowed to take most of what happens pretty seriously, injecting gravity to balance its irony.\n\nThus, Stardust's major challenge involves keeping a consistency in tone. Starting off, it feels awkward -- an encounter between an old border guard and a young would-be trespasser is presented with a half-hearted attempt at being funny; immediately afterwards, we're given a tryst-at-first-sight, eventually leading to a story about a young man who's majorly crushing on a beautiful neighbor but given an embarrassing smackdown by a rival. Meanwhile, we are now firmly set in the knowledge that nothing but a human-height stone wall separates an English village from this huge, magical realm. Are we supposed to take this seriously?\n\nThe early scene with Peter O'Toole finally gives us our answer, as his dying king actually encourages his sons to knock each other off in competition for his throne. It's silly, but it does a good job of relaxing us and loosening us up. Once at ease, we can take in the romantic adventure on a light, easy-to-swallow level. While disarming viewers with plenty of humorous moments, Stardust also wants to be taken seriously -- or, at least, seriously enough -- to give its romantic story a fair impact, and in that, I think it does well enough to pass the exam.\n\nOverall, the movie seems quite straightforward, and we're allowed to simply soak in the pleasantly surprising amount of fun stuff here, such as Michelle Pfeiffer's courageous role of a witch who drinks a potion to make herself look younger, only to rapidly start looking old again the more she exerts magic. It's not a flattering part, but she not only embraces it, she tends to steal all the scenes. Many of the funny bits come from the princes feuding to inherit the throne; as they are killed, they become ghosts who have nothing better to do than to go along for the ride to see which prince gets it next. The cruelest one, Septimus (Mark Strong), eventually succumbs to black comedy as well. And Robert De Niro does well enough with a joke that gets extended more than it needed to be.\n\nMeanwhile, all our central couple (Charlie Cox and Claire Danes) has to do is look pretty and fall in love. And Stardust is content with being just that -- a love story, a playful one that entertains for an evening. In that sense, it doesn't have quite the resonance of The Princess Bride, which actually reveals how a lot of us start off with soft insides but have grown thick armor during the pain of life. Stardust has a sensible, idealistic view of love, which goes along just fine with its chosen flavor of fantasy."}
{"text":"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\n\nDuring World War II, 8-year-old Bruno (Asa Butterfield) and his family leave Berlin to take up residence near the concentration camp where his father (David Thewlis) has just become commandant. Unhappy and lonely, he wanders out behind his house one day and finds Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a Jewish boy of his age. Though the barbed-wire fence of the camp separates them, the boys begin a forbidden friendship, oblivious to the real nature of their surroundings.\n\nWriter-director Mark Herman took on tough material when he chose to adapt \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.\" The 2006 young-adult novel by John Boyne cleaves to a young boy's point of view and his unlikely friendship with a concentration camp inmate to construct an allegory about the Holocaust. Having overheard grown-up conversations, the boy refers to Auschwitz as \"Out-With\" and the Fuehrer as \"the Fury,\" devices that the film cannot depend upon. Translating this dark fable to the screen, Herman for the most part maintains the book's oversimplification of historical events, but he nonetheless crafts an affecting drama that refuses to soft-pedal its harrowing conclusion."}
{"text":"Post-apocalyptic romance blossoms in \"Bellflower\"\n\nEveryone needs a hobby. Some people read vampire novels. Some people play video games. Some people, like the two main characters of the film \"Bellflower,\" prepare for the coming apocalypse by building an arsenal of homemade weapons and heavily armed cars ready to come out on top in the event of \"Mad Max\"-style gang warfare.\n\nBelieve it or not, \"Bellflower\" is actually (kind of) a love story about two friends obsessed with the post-apocalyptic world. Woodrow (director and writer Evan Glodell) is a timid, sensitive type and Aiden (Tyler Dawson) is a charmingly obnoxious bro who forces Woodrow to meet a girl named Milly (Jessie Wiseman) in a contest at a bar to see which of them can eat the most crickets.\n\nThe first act of the movie chronicles the blissful days when Woodrow asks Milly out and they drive from Los Angeles to somewhere in Texas to find \"the cheapest, nastiest, scariest place\" to eat (which, along with the crickets, sums up Milly's personality in a nutshell). Though clich\u00e9, the story is charming and doesn't overstay its welcome. The film then cuts well into the future, with the only indication of the passage of time being that Woodrow has grown an epic beard, at which point their relationship comes to a well-foreshadowed end.\n\nIn addition to the characters' obsession with the apocalypse, \"Bellflower\" distinguishes itself through its unique visual style. Many shots are saturated with orange light, depth-of-field effects often keep the focus on one character by drastically blurring everything else around them. Dirt and grime accumulate on the lenses of the cameras as the film progresses.\n\nSome quick cuts give the audience the bare minimum of information, while other scenes are as slow and deliberate as a Jim Jarmusch film. It's clear a great deal of effort was put into giving the film a careless, indie aesthetic that absolutely works. The setting complements the grimy visual style, as most of the film takes place in an unnamed lower-middle-class suburb that could easily be mistaken for somewhere in Middle America if not for a nearby beach.\n\nPart of the film's appeal is how it takes the viewer for a ride through its own apocalyptic wasteland of a plot, shifting from charming, predictable love story to something else entirely. Suffice to say there are two movies contained in \"Bellflower,\" and they couldn't be more different from one another. About halfway through, Woodrow gets into an accident, suffering brain damage as a result, and the rest of the film unfolds in a strange and nearly nonlinear fashion.\n\nThe filmmakers achieved their unique visual style by constructing some of their own camera setups just as Woodrow and Aiden craft their own weapons, and the parallel works well for the film as a whole. Like their weaponized car Mother Medusa, \"Bellflower\" is a weapon of mass destruction: It lulls the viewer into a false sense of security with its off-kilter love story and then proceeds straight off the deep end.\n\nBut it's far from the perfect crime. \"Bellflower\" becomes tiresome towards the end, having pushed the envelope a touch too far. Once you get it, it's not hard to figure out where the movie will end. When a film takes itself seriously enough to be described as an apocalyptic love story, some heavy-handedness is inevitable.\n\n\"Bellflower\" is a no-budget \"500 Days of Summer\" that substitutes greeting cards for post-apocalypse armaments and light humor for sheer weirdness. It's beautiful and dangerous, though artistically indulgent and not for the faint of heart."}
{"text":"Summary: One of the best Iranian movies ever made, but for an Iranian audience only.\n\nMarmoulak is a political\/social satire, but its comedy is subtle and better understood by an Iranian audience. I'd like to compare it to \"Blazing Saddles\", often cited by American movie watchers as one of the funniest movies ever made, while a non-American audience is only mildly amused by it. Cultural differences play a big role.\n\nMarmoulak's power of humor lies in the comments, words, situations and overall behaviour of the characters, which are not always understandable to the non-Iranian crowd. For instance, many of the seemingly innocent comments in the movie are copied or distorted very cleverly from the political\/religious slogans, speeches and actions of Iran's religious clergy. Those parts are easily identifiable and enjoyable by Iranians, while non-Iranians may not quite understand the subtlety of it.\n\nThat said, the movie is powerful, enjoyable and with brilliant acting. The story is quite simple and has been repeated in many forms before. A jailed thief seizes upon a chance encounter to escape from prison using the stolen clothes of a clergyman. With Prison's warden (depicted as a despotic maniac) after him, he escapes to a border village where the local people think he has been sent for preaching in their mosque. The rest of the movie depicts the thief's efforts to find a way across the border, while playing the role of an unconventional preachers who actually plays a huge role in the life of the villagers.\n\nParviz Parastooi plays the lead role in a breathtakingly magnificent way, and this fact is again only obvious to an Iranian audience who know exactly the class of people he is trying to portrait. The movie has a good pace; in contrast with other well known Iranian movies such as Kiarostami's and Panahi's works that are typically very slow. Dialogues are extremely clever.\n\nGiven 9 out of 10 by this reviewer.\n\n19 of 23 people found this review helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?"}
{"text":"Korean DVD corner: \uc774\ub07c\n\nA blockbuster hit (fourth amongst Korean films, seventh overall) presents itself in the form of an admired online comic's recreation.\n\nRemoved from Korea's metropolitan glitterati, this rural thriller focuses on the suspicious events surrounding the town's spiritual guide's, Ryoo Mok-hyeong, death. Upon his estranged son Ryoo Hae-gook's (Park Hae-il) arrival for his father's interment, a suspicious feeling permeates the country air concerning the religious leader's passing and subsequent events pertaining to his earthly demise.\n\nAt the time of the elder's Ryoo's passing, his presence is shared with current village foreman Cheon Yong-deok (Jeong Jae-yeong). A man who only experiences sinister, self-sufficing thoughts, he presides over the city by way of totalitarian rule and authoritative means with his three dubious henchmen. Realizing the highly suspect nature of past events, Hae-gook prolongs his countryside retreat, seeking prosecutor Park Min-wook's (Yoo Joon-sang) advice and counsel.\n\nHae-gook explores the town's archaic history and formation, unearthing peculiar and uncanny events leading to Yong-deok's reign. Yong-deok is not flattered by current events and a struggle to uncover buried truths is cast for the major characters to duel. Will cultural fallacies be revealed for all to see, or will they be concealed for future generations?\n\nA dense movie saturated with numerous events, subplots, and twists, the movie impressively remains true to its original storyline for the film's overwhelming three-hour duration. The balance among actors creates a cinematic smoothness and theatric cohesion throughout, producing an entertaining and gripping narrative from beginning to end.\n\nThe mysterious, climactic, and dramatic measures are welcomingly interrupted with comedic intervals to lighten the mood and tension, which could not possibly be sustained for nearly three hours. Numerous areas of cinematography are fused to create a unified success while not catapulting one certain element to the highest pedestal at another's expense.\n\nIf you have the staying power to endure the film's length, an entertaining and enjoyable example of cinema is in store."}
