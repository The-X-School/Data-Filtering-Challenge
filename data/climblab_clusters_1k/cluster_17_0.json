{"text":"The\nThis widely reported news is based on a decision by the WHO to classify diesel exhausts as a cause of cancer.\n\nThe decision was taken by the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a panel of experts that co-ordinates and conducts research into the causes of cancer, and develops cancer control strategies.\n\nUnder its classification scheme, diesel exhaust was previously categorised as \"probably carcinogenic\". The agency now says there is now sufficient evidence that exposure to diesel fumes causes lung cancer. It is calling for exposure to diesel fumes to be reduced worldwide.\n\nWhile diesel fumes are now officially carcinogenic, the alarmist tone of the Daily Mail's headline should be viewed with caution because the 'deadly category' of substances the Mail describes also includes sunlight and wood dust.\n\nWhat is diesel and is it used much in the UK?\n\nDiesel oil is a complex mixture of chemicals, mainly distilled from crude oil, although vegetable oil and similar sources can be used to make 'biodiesel'. It is used as fuel for diesel internal combustion engines, which use compressed hot air to ignite fuel (petrol engines have a spark plug to ignite the fuel).\n\nWorldwide, diesel oil is widely used as a fuel in diesel-powered cars, lorries, trains, aircraft, ships and heavy industry. It is regarded as more efficient than petroleum, resulting in lower fuel consumption. WHO says that many people are exposed to diesel exhaust in everyday life, both through their occupations and in the ambient air.\n\nAs of 2007, just over 50% of all new car sales in the UK were diesel, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. In 2004, approximately 700 litres (150 gallons) of diesel was sold every second in the UK, according to a report by the Health Protection Agency (HPA).\n\nThe amount of pollutants from diesel exhaust fumes, in particular its sulphur content, have been reduced over the last few years, and engines on newer cars are designed to burn fuel more efficiently, reducing emissions. However, the IARC says it is not yet clear how these improvements translate into any changes in the impact of diesel fumes on human health. Existing fuels and older unmodified vehicles will take years to replace, particularly in less developed countries where regulations are less stringent, the IARC says.\n\nWhat is the WHO's classification scheme?\n\nThe WHO classifies the cancer-causing potential of various substances into four groups, depending on the evidence available in both humans and other animals:\n\nGroup 1 is used when a substance causes cancer in humans\n\nGroup 2A is used when a substance 'probably' causes cancer in humans\n\nGroup 2B is used when a substance 'possibly' causes cancer in humans\n\nGroup 3 is used when a substance is not classifiable in terms of its cancer-causing properties in humans because the evidence is inadequate\n\nGroup 4 is used when a substance is 'probably not' a cause of cancer in humans\n\nWhat is the WHO now saying about diesel fumes and cancer?\n\nSince 1988, diesel oil fumes have been classified by the IARC as 'probably carcinogenic to humans'. This category is used when there is some, limited evidence that a substance causes cancer in humans, but sufficient evidence it causes cancer in experimental animals.\n\nHowever, the IARC has now reclassified diesel engine exhaust as 'carcinogenic' (group 1 on the list above). This category is used when there is sufficient evidence that a substance causes cancer in humans. The IARC says there is sufficient evidence that diesel exhaust is a cause of lung cancer. It is also associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, although the evidence for the latter is more limited.\n\nWhy has the advice changed?\n\nThe WHO says there has been mounting concern in recent years about the cancer-causing potential of diesel engine exhaust, based on findings from epidemiological studies of workers exposed to diesel fumes. In particular, it cites a large cohort study, published in March this year, of occupational exposure to diesel exhaust in 12,315 US miners. The study was run by the US National Cancer Institute and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. It found that exposure to diesel exhaust increased the risk of dying from lung cancer (1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.44). A further case-control study, undertaken in this group (comparing 198 miners who had died from lung cancer with 562 miners who were alive at the time the 'case' died), found that the risk of lung cancer in these workers increased with the length of time they were exposed to diesel fumes.\n\nAlthough these studies were in workers who had been heavily exposed to diesel fumes, the WHO points out that studies of other carcinogens, such as radon, indicate that initial research showing a risk in heavily exposed populations, are later found to be a risk for the general population. It says that action to reduce exposure to diesel exhaust fumes should encompass both highly exposed workers and the general population.\n\nAre diesel fumes really as dangerous as asbestos and mustard gas?\n\nUnder the IARC classification scheme, diesel fumes now fall into the same category as all other known carcinogens (of which there are over 100 listed). These include:\n\ntobacco smoke (both first and secondhand)\n\nmustard gas\n\nsunlight\n\nChinese salted fish\n\nvinyl chloride\n\nsoot\n\nwood dust\n\nThe WHO does not specify the level of risk posed by different carcinogens, or the risk posed by different levels of exposure. However, for most carcinogens, the higher the exposure, the greater the risk of cancer.\n\nDr Christopher Portier, chair of the IARC working group, said that while the scientific evidence that diesel oil exhaust caused lung cancer was 'compelling', the impact on the wider population who are exposed to diesel fumes at much lower levels and for shorter periods of time, is unknown.\n\nNewspaper readers of a nervous disposition may want to consider the above facts when considering the risk to their health from diesel fumes.\n\nAll ratings\n\nAdd your rating\n\nComments\n\nComments are personal views. Any information they give has not been checked and may not be accurate.\n\nMichaelJMcFadden said on 07 August 2012\n\nSo low levels of exposure to diesel fumes is like low level exposure to sunshine?\n\nFunny how they never seem to think of making that comparison when they talk about low levels of exposure to secondary tobacco smoke in a decently ventilated pub, isn't it? When the articles are about smoke all we see are the comparisons with asbestos, arsenic, and mustard gas.\n\nNor do we see an ending note reassuring us that \"Newspaper readers of a nervous disposition may want to consider the above facts\" about the low level of threat.\n\nThink it might have something to do with politics and social engineering?"}
{"text":"The finding, by UCI chemistry professor Barbara Finlayson-Pitts and a team of researchers, might help solve the mystery of \"missing\" smog particles \u2014 the huge discrepancy known to pollution regulators between the amount of some kinds of smog particles forecast by computer models, and the far larger amount seen in reality.\n\n\"Particles are extremely important in air,\" Finlayson-Pitt said Tuesday. \"And we know they cause increased mortality and health effects in the community. They reduce visibility, and they're a huge player in the whole climate-change game.\"\n\nBut uncertainties in the modeling of the particles, known as secondary organic aerosols, can lead to uncertainties in climate forecasts, she said, as well as in decisions about controlling air pollution.\n\n\"If you ask what is going to happen in the future, if you ask, what will be the effect of various control strategies, it's important that the models get the right answer for the right reason,\" Finlayson-Pitts said.\n\nThe science team, which included researchers from a lab at the U.S. Department of Energy and at Portland State University, used a 26-foot-long device called an aerosol flow tube to mingle pinene, an organic gas found in Pine-Sol as well as outdoors, with nitrogen oxides and ozone.\n\nThe outside of the 26-foot-long aerosol flow tube used in the study. It was designed and built at UC Irvine.

The government and corporations need public oversight to ensure continued implementation and proper enforcement of the law.

The countries in Europe and Asia produce high levels of black carbon and mineral dust, which are types of air pollution. These particles become aerosols in the atmosphere. Some aerosols reflect energy from the sun, which possibly cools the Earth's surface below. But black carbon and mineral dust tend to warm snow-covered surfaces by absorbing energy from the sun.\n\n\"While this research does not fully explain why springtime land temperatures and snow cover are changing so much faster over Eurasia than North America, it does suggest that snow darkening from black carbon, a process lacking in most climate models, is playing a role,\" Flanner said."}
{"text":"Protecting Your Family from Deadly Radon Gas\n\nEven if your home passed a radon test when you bought it, the natural settling of your home over time creates floor cracks which can allow deadly radon gas to come into your house. Exposure to radon in the home is responsible for an estimated 20,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is estimated to have elevated radon levels.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends periodic radon testing, and more frequently if you have family members with asthma, allergies, respiratory illness, or a family history of cancer.\n\nThis article discusses:\n\nWhy should I be concerned about radon?\n\nHow can I tell if I have a problem?\n\nHow to lower the radon levels in your home?\n\nWhy Should I Be Concerned About Radon?\n\nRadon is a cancer-causing radioactive gas which occurs naturally due to\nthe breakdown of uranium in soil, and is usually found in igneous rock and soil.\nRadon gas is odorless and tasteless. The way radon gas gets into your home is that over time, the foundation of your home settles, and as it does hairline cracks form in your floor, and this allows the radon gas to seep into your home. In addition, sometimes building materials can also give off radon. And if your home uses well water, this can be a source of radon in your home.\n\nRadon gas decays into radioactive particles that can get trapped in your lungs when you breathe.\nAs they break down further, these particles release small bursts of energy.\nThis can damage lung tissue and lead to lung cancer over the course of your lifetime.\nNot everyone exposed to elevated levels of radon will develop lung cancer.\nAnd the amount of time between exposure and the onset of the disease may be many years.\n\nIf the radon levels in your home are too high, this can create significant health risks for you and your family.\nThe Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States today.\nAnd if any of your family members are smokers, high levels of radon will significantly increase their risks of getting cancer.\n\nHow Can I Tell If I Have a Problem?\n\nAccording to the EPA, some regions of the country have\nhigher radon levels than others, such as: Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Iowa, large parts of Maine, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, some areas in Nevada.\nAnd here is a map from the EPA:\n\n\nBut the only way to tell if you have radon levels in your home that are too high is by testing. Fortunately this testing can be relatively easy and inexpensive to do.\n\nThe amount of radon in the air is measured in \"picocuries per liter of air,\" or \"pCi\/L.\"\nThe EPA recommends that you should take steps to reduce your radon levels if\nyour home measures more than 4 pCi\/L.\n\nThere are many kinds of low-cost \"do-it-yourself\" radon test kits you can get through the mail\nor in hardware stores and other retail outlets. Or you can hire a qualified tester to do the testing for you.\nFor links and information, visit\n\n\nIn general, there are three ways to test for radon: \"short-term\" testing; \"long-term\" testing; and \"electronic monitoring\".\nAll things considered, electronic monitoring can be the best solution for many homeowners.\n\nSHORT-TERM TESTING:\n\nShort-term radon tests give you a quick snapshot of what your radon levels are,\nbut it is best to do several short-term tests over several periods, and then take the average of the readings.\nDepending on the test device that you use, short-term tests remain in your home for\n2 to 90 days. Types of short-term test kits include \"charcoal canisters,\" \"alpha track,\" \"electret ion chamber,\" \"continuous monitors,\" and \"charcoal liquid scintillation\" detectors.\nA typical short-term test kit will cost about $15-30, and this will sometimes\ninclude the cost of the lab testing fee.\n\nTesting is easy and should only take a few minutes of your time. Just follow the instructions that come with your test kit.\nOnce you've finished the test, re-seal the package and send it to the lab specified on the package right away for analysis.\nYou should receive your test results within a few weeks.\n\nLONG-TERM TESTING:\n\nLong-term tests remain in your home for more than 90 days. Types of long-term test kits include \"alpha track\" and \"electret\" detectors. A long-term test will give you a reading that is more likely to tell you your home's year-round average radon level than a short-term test.\nA typical long-term test kit will cost $50-90, and this will sometimes include\nthe cost of the lab testing fee.\n\nELECTRONIC MONITORING:\n\nElectronic radon monitoring devices provide a continuous digital readout and\nalarm, and cost about $130. But when you consider that even for a short\nterm test that you need to likely test in several locations and get at least\nseveral readings, then an electronic radon monitoring device maybe the best\nsolution for you. Especially since you can continue to use it year after\nyear, and you don't have to send samples to a lab, etc.\n\nThe average indoor radon level is estimated to be about 1.3 pCi\/L, as compared to about 0.4 pCi\/L which is normally found in the outside air. The U.S. Congress has set a long-term goal that indoor radon levels be no more than outdoor levels.\nWhile this goal is not yet technologically achievable in all cases, most homes today can be reduced to 2 pCi\/L or below.\nEven if your test result is below 4 pCi\/L, you may want to routinely test your home, because as mentioned above, as you home settles, it can allow fine cracks to allow radon to begin to seep into your home.\n\nIf you've tested the air in your home and found a radon problem, and your water comes from a well,\nthe you should have your water tested.\n\nHow To Lower the Levels of Radon in Your Home?\n\nIf you determine that you need to reduce the radon levels in your home, there are several ways to accomplish this, and the choice will depend on the type of foundation you have for your home (basement, slab on grade, or crawl space) and how severe your problem is.\nMost solutions involve improved crack sealing and and adding ventilating systems.\n\nBecause you can't see or smell deadly radon gas, it is very easy to ignore a problem which could be lurking and harmful for your family.\nBut fortunately, conducting routine tests are easy and inexpensive. We hope this article has helped you understand what radon is, why you should be concerned, and how to easily test to see if you have a problem"}

This group of people realized if nothing was done, air quality would continue to deteriorate and the state would be in danger of violating federal air quality standards.\n\nIn 2003, the Environmental Initiative was asked by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) to convene a group of businesses, units of government, and environmental organizations to develop a set of strategies to clean up the air. The Clean Air Minnesota Steering Committee, worked to keep Minnesota's air clean through proactive, voluntary approaches. Since the beginning of the partnership, emissions have been reduced from the autobody refinishing industry, printing industry and from diesel fleets. In recent years, the partnership has been focused primarily on reducing diesel emissions to improve air quality.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of more stringent federal air quality standards being released for ground level ozone and particulate matter triggered the need to expand Minnesota's emission reduction efforts beyond diesel. Over the past eighteen months, Environmental Initiative convened a larger group of stakeholders to develop a broader set of strategies to reduce fine particulate matter and ground level ozone emissions, through Minnesota's Clean Air Dialogue.\n\nEnvironmental Initiave plans to formally relaunch Clean Air Minnesota, the state's ongoing stakeholder engagement and partnership on air quality, following the completion of the current process."}

{"text":"(ARA) - Some things we're supposed to do for our health may seem obviously difficult to accomplish: eating less fast food no matter how yummy it tastes, fitting an hour of vigorous exercise into every day, or giving up bad habits like smoking. You may think one bit of common health advice - to get more fresh air and sunshine - would be easy to follow.\n\nThe truth, however, is that our busy, technology-filled modern lives can make it difficult to fulfill our most basic needs for natural light and clean air. Many of us spend eight or more hours a day in an office where we are exposed to artificial light and recirculated air. Even at home, it can be difficult to maintain air and light quality.\n\nThe health benefits of cleaner air and natural light are well-documented. Fresh air often contains fewer health-damaging pollutants than the air found inside buildings. And natural light has been linked to increased levels of the hormone seratonin, which can make people feel happier.\n\nFortunately, you can take steps to increase the amount of fresh air and natural light that enters your living environment.\n\nThe need for fresher air\n\nIndoor air pollution is a significant health concern, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA says research shows people spend about 90 percent of their time indoors, making health risks from indoor pollution greater than risks from outdoor pollution.\n\nSources of indoor pollution include heating fuels like oil, gas, kerosene and wood, building materials, furniture, carpet, tobacco products, household cleaners, personal care products and even heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems if they have not been properly maintained and cleaned. Health effects can range from immediate cold-like symptoms and headaches to longer-term problems, according to the EPA.\n\nModern homes tend to be very air-tight, allowing indoor pollution to build up. Ventilation can help reduce the presence of these pollutants inside your house.\n\nHave your home's HVAC system, including duct work, cleaned and maintained at least once a year. Systems that are functioning optimally will do a better job filtering contaminants from the air.\n\nTake advantage of home improvements that can help improve air quality, such as installing new double-pane windows that are more energy efficient and easy to open and new window screens that will admit fresh air but keep out pests. You can also add function and decorating drama by adding Energy Star-qualified venting skylights that work with vertical windows to provide a natural chimney effect, passively venting moisture, fumes and potentially harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from your home. Visit  to learn more about skylights.\n\nBenefits of brightening your environment\n\nNatural light offers a myriad of health benefits, including promoting the body's production of Vitamin D, and boosting serotonin levels in the brain. Lower serotonin levels have been associated with depression, a drop in physical energy, increased appetite and increased desire for sleep.\n\nRelying on natural light to help illuminate your home can lower your energy bills - by reducing the need for artificial light - and boost your personal energy levels. Fortunately, you can do many things to increase the amount of natural light that enters your home, from simple steps such as keeping windows clean to adding additional sources of natural light, such as skylights.\n\n\"Skylights admit 30 percent more light than vertical windows in dormers, and provide the mood-boosting drama of a sky view that can't be achieved with vertical windows,\" says Ross Vandermark of Velux, manufacturers of the \"No-Leak Skylight.\" \"Skylights can increase your exposure to balanced and healthful natural light, provide ventilation, and preserve privacy without taking up valuable wall space that can be used for decorating or storage.\"\n\nFor more information on the benefits of natural light and skylight selection, or to locate a certified installer near you, call (800) 283-2831 or visit  For government information on window and skylight energy efficiency visit  and for independent agency information visit  or"}

Scientists have tackled the complicated mix of environmental, social and economic factors that influence health, particularly focusing on naturally occurring toxins, man-made pollutants, nanoparticles and pathogens to see:\n\n\u2022 how they spread within the environment\n\n\u2022 how their properties change as they interact with other substances or organisms\n\n\u2022 how we become exposed to them, and\n\n\u2022 their impact on human health.\n\nThe Programme has not only succeeded in bringing together scientists from a broad range of environmental, social and biomedical backgrounds, but also fostered new relationships with end users and policy makers. This new community is helping to provide the multidisciplinary capacity able to respond in an interdisciplinary way to resolve problems that are intrinsically interfacial in character. Many of these questions relate to complex issues such as the environmental biology and geochemistry of soils and how these influence the transport, accessibility and bioavailability of chemical pollutants and infectivity of pathogens. The dispersion of harmful particles in the atmosphere is another area of major concern where the E&HH Programme has broken new ground by showing how the chemical and physical properties of such particles influence their environmental behaviour and may govern their toxicity and resultant pathological reactions induced following inhalation. Working groups and networks have identified potential health problems concerning the transport and emergence of human pathogens associated with food, soil, air and water. The consequence(s) of global and regional climate change for the environmental behaviours of pollutants and pathogens have been considered by a number of the projects supported by the E&HH programme.\n\nThe selection of articles in this supplement reflect the broad scope of the E&HH programme. By effectively identifying and interconnecting these interdisciplinary elements, the E&HH programme has fostered the emergence of new ways of solving problems in areas of research that have, until recently, had little connection with one another. This has not only helped build new research groupings, but has also led to exciting new scientific developments as described in this issue of Environmental Health.\n\nKeywords\n\nArticle\n\nProof of concept pilot study: prevalence of grass virus infection and the potential for effects on the allergenic potency of pollen\n\nWild plants harbour a variety of viruses and these have the potential to alter the composition of pollen.

Allergen profiles of extracts were investigated by Western blotting for IgE with sera from allergic subjects.\n\nResults\n\nThe prevalence of CSV infection in cocksfoot grasses sampled from the study site varied significantly over an eight-year period, but infection rates of up to 70% were detected. Virus infection was associated with small alterations in the quantities of pollen proteins detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and in the patterns of allergens identified by Western blotting with IgE from grass pollen allergic subjects. For individual subjects there were differences in potencies of standardised extracts of pollen from virus-free and virus-infected plants as assessed by skin testing, though a consistent pattern was not established for the group of 15 subjects.\n\nConclusion\n\nInfection rates for CSV in cocksfoot grass can be high, though variable. Virus-induced alterations in components of grass pollen have the potential to alter the allergenic potency.\n\nKeywords\n\nArticle\n\nStrategies for monitoring and managing mass populations of toxic cyanobacteria in recreational waters: a multi-interdisciplinary approach\n\nMass populations of toxin-producing cyanobacteria commonly develop in fresh-, brackish- and marine waters and effective strategies for monitoring and managing cyanobacterial health risks are required to safeguard animal and human health. A multi-interdisciplinary study, including two UK freshwaters with a history of toxic cyanobacterial blooms, was undertaken to explore different approaches for the identification, monitoring and management of potentially-toxic cyanobacteria and their associated risks. The results demonstrate that (i) cyanobacterial bloom occurrence can be predicted at a local- and national-scale using process-based and statistical models; (ii) cyanobacterial concentration and distribution in waterbodies can be monitored using remote sensing, but minimum detection limits need to be evaluated; (iii) cyanotoxins may be transferred to spray-irrigated root crops; and (iv) attitudes and perceptions towards risks influence the public's preferences and willingness-to-pay for cyanobacterial health risk reductions in recreational waters.\n\nThe potential for poisoning of humans through their consumption of shellfish which have themselves consumed biotoxin producing marine phytoplankton exists in the UK. Toxins are bio-accumulated within the shellfish flesh allowing them to reach harmful concentrations. This threat is in most part mitigated by monitoring programmes that assess both the presence of potentially harmful phytoplankton and shellfish flesh toxicity. However, the medical profession in the UK remains relatively ignorant of the potential for biotoxin derived shellfish toxicity, preventing quantification of magnitude, frequency, and severity of health effects in the community or the medical significance of more recently discovered toxins. While the current causative species and their toxins are relatively well characterised there remains a lack of understanding of the factors governing the temporal and spatial appearance of harmful phytoplankton. Expansion of shellfish aquaculture is likely both worldwide and in the UK. Better understanding of how harmful phytoplankton interact with their environment to promote the sporadic harmful blooms that we observe is required to underpin risk assessments.\n\nKeywords\n\nArticle\n\nA framework to explore micronutrient deficiency in maternal and child health in Malawi, Southern Africa\n\nGlobal food insecurity is associated with micronutrient deficiencies and it has been suggested that 4.5 billion people world-wide are affected by deficiencies in iron, vitamin A and iodine. Zinc has also been identified to be of increasing concern. The most vulnerable are young children and women of childbearing age. A pilot study has been carried out in Southern Malawi, to attempt to link the geochemical and agricultural basis of micronutrient supply through spatial variability to maternal health and associated cultural and social aspects of nutrition. The aim is to establish the opportunity for concerted action to deliver step change improvements in the nutrition of developing countries.\n\nResults\n\nField work undertaken in August 2007 and July\/August 2008 involved the collection of blood, soil and crop samples, and questionnaires from ~100 pregnant women. Complex permissions and authorisation protocols were identified and found to be as much part of the cultural and social context of the work as the complexity of the interdisciplinary project. These issues are catalogued and discussed. A preliminary spatial evaluation is presented linking soil quality and food production to nutritional health. It also considers behavioural and cultural attitudes of women and children in two regions of southern Malawi, (the Shire Valley and Shire Highlands plateau). Differences in agricultural practice and widely varying soil quality (e.g. pH organic matter, C\/N and metal content) were observed for both regions and full chemical analysis of soil and food is underway. Early assessment of blood data suggests major differences in health and nutritional status between the two regions. Differences in food availability and type and observations of life style are being evaluated through questionnaire analysis.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe particular emphasis of the study is on the interdisciplinary opportunities and the barriers to progress in development support in subsistence communities. Engaging at the community level and the balance of expectations from both study subjects and research team highlight the merit of careful and detailed planning and project delivery.\n\nKeywords\n\nArticle\n\nSpace-time clustering analyses of type 1 diabetes in children from north-east England: support for an infectious aetiology?\n\nThe aetiology of type 1 diabetes in children is uncertain. A number of recent studies have suggested an infectious aetiology. It has been postulated that an infectious agent may be involved. Support for this hypothesis may be provided by a finding of space-time clustering. The aims of this study were: (i) to determine whether there was space-time clustering in cases of childhood diabetes from north-east England; and to test for differences in space-time clustering: (ii) due to age at diagnosis; (iii) between the sexes and (iv) between levels of residential population density.\n\nMethods\n\nWe studied incidence of type 1 diabetes diagnosed in children aged 0-14 years and diagnosed during the period 1990-2007. All cases were resident in a defined geographical region of north-east England (Northumberland, Newcastle upon Tyne and North Tyneside). We applied a second-order procedure based on K-functions to test for global clustering. Locations were residential addresses at time of diagnosis. Tests were repeated using nearest neighbour thresholds to allow for variable population density, providing the primary result for each analysis. Differences between sexes and between levels of population density were assessed.\n\nResults\n\nWe analysed 457 cases of type 1 diabetes. Overall, there was marginally significant evidence of global space-time clustering (P = 0.089). There was statistically significant clustering amongst pairs of cases that contained at least one female (P = 0.017), but not amongst pairs of cases that contained at least one male (P = 0.190). Furthermore, there was significant clustering amongst pairs of cases that contained at least one from a more densely populated area (P = 0.044), but not amongst pairs of cases that contained at least one from a less densely populated area (P = 0.226).\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough the analyses have only found marginally significant evidence of global space-time clustering for cases of type 1 diabetes diagnosed in north-east England, there were two notable findings. First, there was evidence of clustering amongst females and secondly clustering was confined to cases from more densely populated areas. These findings are consistent with a possible aetiological involvement of an infectious agent.\n\nAre pathogens in outdoor air a health issue at present or will they become a problem in the future? A working group called AirPath - Outdoor Environments and Human Pathogens in Air was set up in 2007 at University College London, UK with the aim of opening new discussion and creating a research network to investigate the science and impacts of outdoor pathogens. Our objective in this paper is to review and discuss the following areas: What is the source of human pathogens in outdoor air? What current, developing and future techniques do we need? Can we identify at-risk groups in relation to their activities and environments? How do we prepare for the anticipated challenges of environmental change and new and emerging diseases? And how can we control for and prevent pathogens in outdoor environments? We think that this work can benefit the wider research community and policy makers by providing a concise overview of various research aspects and considerations which may be important to their work.\n\nKeywords\n\nArticle\n\nSeasonal hazards and health risks in lower-income countries: field testing a multi-disciplinary approach\n\nUnderstanding how risks to human health change as a result of seasonal variations in environmental conditions is likely to become of increasing importance in the context of climatic change, especially in lower-income countries. A multi-disciplinary approach can be a useful tool for improving understanding, particularly in situations where existing data resources are limited but the environmental health implications of seasonal hazards may be high. This short article describes a multi-disciplinary approach combining analysis of changes in levels of environmental contamination, seasonal variations in disease incidence and a social scientific analysis of health behaviour. The methodology was field-tested in a peri-urban environment in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, where poor households face alternate seasonal extremes in the local environment as the water level in the Delta changes from flood to dry season. Low-income households in the research sites rely on river water for domestic uses, including provision of drinking water, and it is commonly perceived that the seasonal changes alter risk from diarrhoeal diseases and other diseases associated with contamination of water. The discussion focuses on the implementation of the methodology in the field, and draws lessons from the research process that can help in refining and developing the approach for application in other locations where seasonal dynamics of disease risk may have important consequences for public health.\n\nBacterial pathogens are ubiquitous in soil and water - concurrently so are free-living helminths that feed on bacteria. These helminths fall into two categories; the non-parasitic and the parasitic. The former have been the focus of previous work, finding that bacterial pathogens inside helminths are conferred survival advantages over and above bacteria alone in the environment, and that accidental ingestion of non-parasitic helminths can cause systemic infection in vertebrate hosts. Here, we determine the potential for bacteria to be associated with parasitic helminths. After culturing helminths from fecal samples obtained from livestock the external bacteria were removed. Two-hundred parasitic helminths from three different species were homogenised and the bacteria that were internal to the helminths were isolated and cultured. Eleven different bacterial isolates were found; of which eight were indentified. The bacteria identified included known human and cattle pathogens. We concluded that bacteria of livestock can be isolated in parasitic helminths and that this suggests a mechanism by which bacteria, pathogenic or otherwise, can be transmitted between individuals. The potential for helminths to play a role as pathogen vectors poses a potential livestock and human health risk. Further work is required to assess the epidemiological impact of this finding.\n\nKeywords\n\nArticle\n\nEvidence-based selection of environmental factors and datasets for measuring multiple environmental deprivation in epidemiological research\n\nThis Environment and Human Health project aims to develop a health-based summary measure of multiple physical environmental deprivation for the UK, akin to the measures of multiple socioeconomic deprivation that are widely used in epidemiology. Here we describe the first stage of the project, in which we aimed to identify health-relevant dimensions of physical environmental deprivation and acquire suitable environmental datasets to represent population exposure to these dimensions at the small-area level. We present the results of this process: an evidence-based list of environmental dimensions with population health relevance for the UK, and the spatial datasets we obtained and processed to represent these dimensions. This stage laid the foundations for the rest of the project, which will be reported elsewhere.\n\nThe quantification of uncertainty and variability is a key component of quantitative risk analysis. Recent advances in Bayesian statistics make it ideal for integrating multiple sources of information, of different types and quality, and providing a realistic estimate of the combined uncertainty in the final risk estimates.\n\nMethods\n\nWe present two case studies related to foodborne microbial risks. In the first, we combine models to describe the sequence of events resulting in illness from consumption of milk contaminated with VTEC O157. We used Monte Carlo simulation to propagate uncertainty in some of the inputs to computer models describing the farm and pasteurisation process. Resulting simulated contamination levels were then assigned to consumption events from a dietary survey. Finally we accounted for uncertainty in the dose-response relationship and uncertainty due to limited incidence data to derive uncertainty about yearly incidences of illness in young children. Options for altering the risk were considered by running the model with different hypothetical policy-driven exposure scenarios. In the second case study we illustrate an efficient Bayesian sensitivity analysis for identifying the most important parameters of a complex computer code that simulated VTEC O157 prevalence within a managed dairy herd. This was carried out in 2 stages, first to screen out the unimportant inputs, then to perform a more detailed analysis on the remaining inputs. The method works by building a Bayesian statistical approximation to the computer code using a number of known code input\/output pairs (training runs).\n\nResults\n\nWe estimated that the expected total number of children aged 1.5-4.5 who become ill due to VTEC O157 in milk is 8.6 per year, with 95% uncertainty interval (0,11.5). The most extreme policy we considered was banning on-farm pasteurisation of milk, which reduced the estimate to 6.4 with 95% interval (0,11). In the second case study the effective number of inputs was reduced from 30 to 7 in the screening stage, and just 2 inputs were found to explain 82.8% of the output variance. A combined total of 500 runs of the computer code were used.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese case studies illustrate the use of Bayesian statistics to perform detailed uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, integrating multiple information sources in a way that is both rigorous and efficient.\n\nThe aim of this project was to compare cerium oxide and silver particles of different sizes for their potential for uptake by aquatic species, human exposure via ingestion of contaminated food sources and to assess their resultant toxicity. The results demonstrate the potential for uptake of nano and larger particles by fish via the gastrointestinal tract, and by human intestinal epithelial cells, therefore suggesting that ingestion is a viable route of uptake into different organism types. A consistency was also shown in the sensitivity of aquatic, fish cell and human cell models to Ag and CeO2 particles of different sizes; with the observed sensitivity sequence from highest to lowest as: nano-Ag > micro Ag > nano CeO2 = micro CeO2. Such consistency suggests that further studies might allow extrapolation of results between different models and species.\n\nKeywords\n\nArticle\n\nCharacterisation of carbon nanotubes in the context of toxicity studies\n\nNanotechnology has the potential to revolutionise our futures, but has also prompted concerns about the possibility that nanomaterials may harm humans or the biosphere. The unique properties of nanoparticles, that give them novel size dependent functionalities, may also have the potential to cause harm. Discrepancies in existing human health and environmental studies have shown the importance of good quality, well-characterized reference nanomaterials for toxicological studies.\n\nHere we make a case for the importance of the detailed characterization of nanoparticles, using several methods, particularly to allow the recognition of impurities and the presence of chemically identical but structurally distinct phases. Methods to characterise fully, commercially available multi-wall carbon nanotubes at different scales, are presented.\n\nAn exploratory XPS and FTIR investigation of the surfaces of bulk quartz powders widely used in toxicological studies (DQ12 and Min-U-Sil 5) was carried with the aim of correlating surface features with toxicity as reflected by indicators of biological response. Some patches of amorphous silica were identified as well as varying amounts of calcium but none of these features correlated with biological response. No evidence of widely-quoted surface silanol (SiOH) structures was found in this investigation and the possibility that FTIR artefacts have been previously misidentified as silanol structures is discussed.\n\nA methodology is presented and validated through which long-term fixed site air quality measurements are used to characterise and remove temporal signals in sample-based measurements which have good spatial coverage but poor temporal resolution. The work has been carried out specifically to provide a spatial dataset of atmospheric ultrafine particle (UFP < 100 nm) data for ongoing epidemiologic cohort analysis but the method is readily transferable to wider epidemiologic investigations and research into the health effects of other pollutant species.\n\nCompelling evidence of major health benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and outdoor interaction with 'greenspace' have emerged in the past decade - all of which combine to give major potential health benefits from 'grow-your-own' (GYO) in urban areas. However, neither current risk assessment models nor risk management strategies for GYO in allotments and gardens give any consideration to these health benefits, despite their potential often to more than fully compensate the risks. Although urban environments are more contaminated by heavy metals, arsenic, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and dioxins than most rural agricultural areas, evidence is lacking for adverse health outcomes of GYO in UK urban areas. Rarely do pollutants in GYO food exceed statutory limits set for commercial food, and few people obtain the majority of their food from GYO. In the UK, soil contamination thresholds triggering closure or remediation of allotment and garden sites are based on precautionary principles, generating 'scares' that may negatively impact public health disproportionately to the actual health risks of exposure to toxins through own-grown food. By contrast, the health benefits of GYO are a direct counterpoint to the escalating public health crisis of 'obesity and sloth' caused by eating an excess of saturated fats, inadequate consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables combined with a lack of exercise. These are now amongst the most important preventable causes of illness and death. The health and wider societal benefits of 'grow-your-own' thus reveal a major limitation in current risk assessment methodologies which, in only considering risks, are unable to predict whether GYO on particular sites will, overall, have positive, negative, or no net effects on human health. This highlights a more general need for a new generation of risk assessment tools that also predict overall consequences for health to more effectively guide risk management in our increasingly risk-averse culture.\n\nStudies of disinfection by-products in drinking water and measures of adverse fetal growth have often been limited by exposure assessment lacking data on individual water use, and therefore failing to reflect individual variation in DBP exposure.\n\nMethods\n\nPregnant women recruited to the Born in Bradford cohort study completed a questionnaire which covers water exposure. Information was collected on water consumption, showering, bathing and swimming. Water exposure data from a subset of 39 women of the cohort are described here.\n\nResults\n\nMean total tap water intake was 1.8 l\/day, and women on average spent 146 minutes per week showering and bathing. Most tap water intake occurred at home (100% for unemployed, 71.8% for employed). Differences between age groups were observed for total tap water intake overall (p = 0.02) and at home (p = 0.01), and for bottled water intake (p = 0.05). There were differences between ethnic groups for tap water intake at home (p = 0.02) and total tap water intake at work (p = 0.02). Total tap water intake at work differed by income category (p = 0.001). Duration per shower was inversely correlated with age (Spearman's correlation -0.39, p = 0.02), and differed according to employment status (p = 0.04), ethnicity (p = 0.02) and income (p = 0.02).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study provides estimates of water exposure in pregnant women in a multi-ethnic population in the north of England and suggests differences related to age, employment, income and ethnicity. The findings are valuable to inform exposure assessment in studies assessing the relationship between DBPs and adverse birth outcomes.\n\nKeywords\n\nArticle\n\nCurrent and future climate- and air pollution-mediated impacts on human health\n\nWe describe a project to quantify the burden of heat and ozone on mortality in the UK, both for the present-day and under future emission scenarios.\n\nMethods\n\nMortality burdens attributable to heat and ozone exposure are estimated by combination of climate-chemistry modelling and epidemiological risk assessment. Weather forecasting models (WRF) are used to simulate the driving meteorology for the EMEP4UK chemistry transport model at 5 km by 5 km horizontal resolution across the UK; the coupled WRF-EMEP4UK model is used to simulate daily surface temperature and ozone concentrations for the years 2003, 2005 and 2006, and for future emission scenarios. The outputs of these models are combined with evidence on the ozone-mortality and heat-mortality relationships derived from epidemiological analyses (time series regressions) of daily mortality in 15 UK conurbations, 1993-2003, to quantify present-day health burdens.\n\nResults\n\nDuring the August 2003 heatwave period, elevated ozone concentrations > 200 \u03bcg m-3 were measured at sites in London and elsewhere. This and other ozone photochemical episodes cause breaches of the UK air quality objective for ozone. Simulations performed with WRF-EMEP4UK reproduce the August 2003 heatwave temperatures and ozone concentrations. There remains day-to-day variability in the high ozone concentrations during the heatwave period, which on some days may be explained by ozone import from the European continent.\n\nPreliminary calculations using extended time series of spatially-resolved WRF-EMEP4UK model output suggest that in the summers (May to September) of 2003, 2005 & 2006 over 6000 deaths were attributable to ozone and around 5000 to heat in England and Wales. The regional variation in these deaths appears greater for heat-related than for ozone-related burdens.\n\nChanges in UK health burdens due to a range of future emission scenarios will be quantified. These future emissions scenarios span a range of possible futures from assuming current air quality legislation is fully implemented, to a more optimistic case with maximum feasible reductions, through to a more pessimistic case with continued strong economic growth and minimal implementation of air quality legislation.\n\nConclusion\n\nElevated surface ozone concentrations during the 2003 heatwave period led to exceedences of the current UK air quality objective standards. A coupled climate-chemistry model is able to reproduce these temperature and ozone extremes. By combining model simulations of surface temperature and ozone with ozone-heat-mortality relationships derived from an epidemiological regression model, we estimate present-day and future health burdens across the UK. Future air quality legislation may need to consider the risk of increases in future heatwaves.\n\nThis paper describes an exploratory study of endotoxin emissions and dispersal from a commercial composting facility. Replicated samples of air were taken by filtration at different locations around the facility on 10 occasions. Measurements were made of endotoxin and associated culturable microorganisms. The inflammatory response of cell cultures exposed to extracts from the filters was measured. Endotoxin was detected in elevated concentrations close to composting activities. A secondary peak, of lesser magnitude than the peak at source was detected at 100-150 m downwind of the site boundary. Unexpectedly high concentrations of endotoxin were measured at the most distant downwind sampling point. Extracted endotoxin was found to stimulate human monocytes and a human lung epithelial cell line to produce significant amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On a weight basis, endotoxin extracted from the composting source has a greater inflammatory cytokine inducing effect than commercial E. coli endotoxin."}

{"text":"China's Olympian efforts to tackle air pollution\n\nChinese action on Olympic air pollution is a huge experiment that will be closely watched across China, and further afield, writes Wang Ying.\n\nAs the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games get underway, an expensive environmental experiment is taking place, providing a golden opportunity for pollution science.\n\nThe Beijing Olympic Air Quality Monitoring and Warning Project, a 30 million yuan (US$4.3 million) monitoring system, has been created in an attempt to guarantee clear skies for the games.\n\nJointly launched by the Beijing municipal government and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the system has been fully active since June. It has 25 comprehensive air quality monitoring stations and several mobile surveillance vehicles in Beijing and adjacent cities.\n\nBeijing's air quality has been unpalatable to some athletes. Back in May, the marathon world record holder Haile Gebrselassie, who suffers from asthma, confirmed that he would skip the games for fear of Beijing smog. And in June, Australian officials said their track and field athletes will not participate in the opening ceremony, partly because of pollution problems.\n\nBut Chinese scientists say the monitoring is providing ways to improve air quality, in the short term at least.\n\nChina's pollution problem\n\nChina has been monitoring air quality since the 1950s. But in the late 1990s, air quality worsened and respiratory disease increased, triggering attempts to tackle the problem.\n\nTen cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, started issuing daily air quality reports in 1998.\n\nEach year, China sees 350,000 cases of respiratory diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis, due to urban air pollution. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention estimates this costs around seven per cent of the country's annual gross domestic product.\n\nJin Yinlong, an official with the centre, says that although the country's air quality has recently improved, urban air pollution \"remains serious\".\n\nIn 2006, 37.6 per cent of China's 559 major cities did not meet national air quality standards.\n\n\"Vehicle emissions contribute 60 to 70 per cent of air pollution in Beijing, and these pollutants usually stay in the air for three to four days,\" Wang adds.\n\nOlympic preparations\n\nWhen Beijing was awarded the 2008 Olympics in 2001, the city's air pollution came under further scrutiny.\n\nWhen Beijing was awarded the 2008 Olympics in 2001, the city's air pollution came under further scrutiny\n\nFlickr\/Jim O'Connell\n\nThe Beijing Municipal Government pledged a green Olympics to the International Olympic Council. Under that commitment, concentrations of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ground-level ozone should meet WHO recommended levels for air quality, and dust concentrations should be comparable to levels in major cities in developed countries.\n\nThey ordered 19 heavily polluting industries to cut emissions by 30 per cent, and closed large factories in major pollution source areas, such as the Yanshan petrochemical zone and around the Beijing Capital International Airport.\n\nBeijing's traffic also faces strict controls. An 'even-and-odd' licence plate rule, implemented three weeks before the games open, lets drivers use their cars only on alternate days.\n\nA trial of the system last summer pulled 1.3 out of the city's three million cars off the roads each day, reducing pollutants by 17\u201328 per cent.\n\nPoised for action\n\nBeijing environment officials have vowed to publish air quality forecasts up to a week in advance during the games.\n\n\"If air pollution is to reach an alarming level, often triggered by extreme weather conditions, such as high temperatures, high humidity and no wind, emergency plans will start, including pulling more cars off road or shutting down more factories,\" says Liu Jianguo a scientist on the air quality project, and deputy director of CAS's Key Laboratory of Environmental Optics and Technology.\n\nBeijing has 40 ground-level air quality monitoring stations able to measure up to an altitude of ten metres, and the 25 comprehensive monitoring stations in the Olympic Air Quality Project can measure pollution up to five kilometres.\n\nThe higher elevation monitoring lets scientists trace pollutants from neighbouring cities, as well as local sources.\n\nWang Yuesi explains that the weather and geographical conditions both in Beijing and nearby areas control how regional air pollutants accumulate and disperse, particularly in the summer.\n\nWinds from the south and southeast sweep through Beijing in summer. They blow pollutants to the north and northwest, where the mountains slow down their spread, letting them descend upon the city.\n\nBy measuring the amount of pollutants floating into Beijing at its outskirts, CAS scientists estimated in June that 30 per cent of the capital's pollutants come from nearby cities.\n\nA CAS technician checks air monitoring data in a Beijing monitoring site\n\nSu Lin\n\nNow, Bejing's neighbouring areas \u2014 such as the provinces of Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and Inner Mongolia \u2014 are helping out by closing factories and removing highly polluting cars.\n\nBeijing is also seeking advice from further afield. A 12-member panel on air quality assessment, including three foreign experts, will help monitor air quality during the Games.\n\nIvo Allegrini, a member of the panel and head of the air pollution department at the Italian National Research Center, told SciDev.Net he will be leading an Italian team working in Beijing throughout August, beyond the two weeks of the games. His team will receive data from the Environmental Protection Bureau and will also conduct independent monitoring.\n\nThe latest technology\n\nThe techniques being used during the Olympics showcase China's latest monitoring technologies that can now measure air quality out in the field, as well as air samples in the laboratory.\n\nUltraviolet and infrared radiation spectroscopy technologies help to monitor trace gases in the atmosphere. To study the correlation between pollutants and traffic, microwave radars have been installed at main roads in Beijing to count the vehicles on the road each hour.\n\nMeteorological instruments also measure temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction, to better understand how pollutants spread in different weather conditions.\n\nAnd much of the equipment used is produced in China for China's needs.\n\n\"About 70 per cent of the devices used in the [monitoring] network were developed domestically, including the equipment that measures pollutants such as nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, methane, ammonia and VOCs,\" says Liu Wenqing, a member of an expert panel for China's National High-Tech Programme, which has earmarked several million dollars annually for environment projects.\n\nBut Liu says more could be done, pointing out that China has launched dozens of satellites, but not one has been used for air quality monitoring. Instead, China uses foreign satellite data. Yet the United States and some European countries, such as the United Kingdom, have used remote sensing satellites for air quality monitoring since 1995.\n\n\"We do not lack talents or technology, but policy support,\" says Liu.\n\nChina also lacks the large-scale monitoring equipment that can provide more accurate data, and the equipment to deal with extreme air pollution emergencies, such as an explosion at a chemical factory or a major gas leakage, Liu adds.\n\nFurther afield and the future\n\nAs the Olympics approach, scientists are watching closely to see how effective pollution control will be, both for Beijing and beyond.\n\nUS scientists believe that as much as 25 per cent of the air pollution in Los Angeles comes from China. An article in the Los Angeles Times stated, \"When the Chinese undertake this enormous change in their emissions, it will send a signal to the United States that the control of air pollution in one part of the world can in fact affect the atmosphere on the other side of the globe\".\n\nScientists are watching closely to see how effective pollution control will be, for Beijing and beyond\n\nFlickr\/qmetrail\n\n\"The scientific community should plan immediately to take advantage of this monumental experiment, mobilising to measure the effect by studying pollution levels before, during and after the great shutdown,\" the article reads.\n\nLos Angeles itself took radical measures to cut smog in 1984 when it hosted the Olympics, forcing political leaders to tackle the issue.\n\nChinese scientists hope for a similar effect. The monitoring area for the Olympics includes 79 cities in the greater Beijing area and CAS is looking to expand this network in the long run, including to the two city clusters of Guangzhou and Shanghai.\n\nCAS has already begun cooperating with Guangzhou and Shanghai to promote regional air quality management. The Beijing experience will be particularly useful since Shanghai will host the 2010 World Expo and Guangzhou will host the 2010 Asian Games.\n\nIn April, CAS signed a contract with the Beijing municipal government to jointly tackle Beijing's long-term air pollution. The city's five-year environmental plan (2005\u201310) aims to cut major air pollutants by 20 per cent of 2005 levels and develop an environmental management system in Beijing and nearby cities"}

{"text":"The Chinese city of Xi'an has some of the worst air quality in the world. Yet its air is significantly safer than the air in U.S. cities, according to a new study.\n\nAnd if you have trouble believing that, then you ought to have trouble believing Obama Environmental Protection Agency claims that U.S. ambient air quality is killing tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people per year.\n\nChinese researchers compared data on air pollution and death rates in Xi'an from 2004 to 2008. In 2006, the World Health Organization ranked Xi'an as having the second worst air pollution in Asia, which means the second worst in the world.\n\nThe study was just published online (Jan. 3) in Environmental Health Perspectives.\n\nThe city of Xi'an had the second worst air quality in Asia in 2006.\n\nUsing the same sort of data and statistical analysis employed by EPA-funded air quality researchers, the Chinese researchers reported having statistically correlated every 10 microgram per cubic meter's (\u03bcg\/m3) worth of fine particulate matter (soot or PM2.5) in Xi'an's air with a 0.2% increase in the city's death rate.\n\nWhile that sounds like a result in the statistical noise range \u2014 and it is as the mean daily death toll in Xi'an is only about 26.2 \u2014 we're going to overlook that normally fatal flaw and, instead, momentarily embrace the result so that we can compare it with what EPA-funded researchers claim about U.S. cities.\n\nIn a 2009 study of 112 U.S. cities, EPA-funded researchers reported that every 10 \u03bcg\/m3 worth of PM2.5 correlated with about a 1.0% increase in death rate. Once again this is, in reality, statistical noise. But in the fantasy world of EPA air quality science it is five times greater than what Chinese researchers reported from the second dirtiest city in the world.\n\nBut there's more. Just how dirty is the air in Xi'an?\n\nAs measured by the Chinese researchers, the air in Xi'an is, on average, 9-10 times more polluted in terms of PM2.5 than the median PM2.5 levels of the two most polluted cities in the 112-city study (Rubidoux, CA and Los Angeles, CA).\n\nAnd that dirty Chinese air, according to EPA scientific practice, is safer than U.S. air by a factor of five. This is shocking since if air pollution really was deadly, one would expect to see this phenomena operating in high gear in the respiratory horror story that Xi'an should be.\n\nLeaving the fantasy land of EPA air quality science and returning to the real-world, however, clean U.S. air is axiomatically not more dangerous than filthy Chinese air and so some sort of explanation of these results is required.\n\nThe scientific and medical reality is that PM2.5 \u2014 even as high as it is in China \u2014 does not kill or hasten death.\n\nPM 2.5 was such a public health problem in the U.S., in fact, that no one knew about it until EPA-funded researchers invented it in 1993 with the so-called \"Six Cities Study\" \u2014 30 years after the Clean Air Act was enacted.\n\nConcern for PM2.5 \u2014 the primary and virtually sole justification for recent costly EPA regulation like the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the Mercury and Toxics Standard (MATS) \u2014 has been entirely manufactured and ruthlessly exploited by the EPA for almost 20 years.\n\nThe agency has been able to get away with this scam because it has cleverly hidden key data with a clique of private researchers in academic institutions who are beyond Congressional and Freedom of Information Act reach.\n\nObtaining the EPA data may no longer be so important for debunking purposes, however, given the emerging reality in China.\n\nThough I write to defend the natural gas industry from the junk science hurled at it and the drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing (fracking), I do so with mixed emotions.\n\nTwo recent government reports, one from the United Kingdom and the other from Oklahoma, have tried to draw a connection between fracking and seismic activity occurring in those areas. In the UK, the seismic activity registered 3 on the Richter scale (vibrations similar to a passing truck). In Oklahoma, the activity registered between 1.0 and 2.8. Neither report could attribute with any certainty the seismic activity to the local fracking, as that would be nearly impossible to do given the multifactorial nature of seismic activity.\n\nSo: of the more than one million fracking or fracking-like operations that have occurred, unattributable seismic activity has been detected twice. Moreover, no structural damage was attributed to any of the seismic activity.\n\nScientifically and from a risk management perspective, fracking should be off the hook. But of course it's not, because radical environmentalists loathe fracking \u2014 cheap natural gas means that the world won't be giving up fossil fuels anytime soon \u2014 and so they have their long knives out for it. You can safely bet that anytime seismic activity coincides with fracking activity, they will use that coincidence to whip up fear.\n\nAnd if it's not earthquakes, it will be fracking fluids in drinking water. Or fracking's greenhouse gas emissions. Or whatever can be dreamed up to scare people about the expanding industry of extracting natural gas from shale formations.\n\nAs we've learned with other environmental scaremongering, there are countless junk science-based ways to scare the public, and you can rest assured the radicals will dream them up and employ them to great effect.\n\nWhat this means is that the shale gas industry will be under continual attack, and that the attacks won't stop until fracking does.\n\nHowever, while I'm more than happy to spotlight and debunk the enviros' use of junk science, I'm also more than a little annoyed at the junk science that the shale gas industry itself is apparently quite happy to use against its brethren fossil fuels.\n\nIf you've followed the 21st century environmentalist war against fossil fuel, you've probably heard of the \"Dirty Faces\" anti-coal campaign: advertisements featuring coal-smudged faces, proclaiming that coal is \"dirty\" because its emits greenhouse gas carbon dioxide \u2014 ironically, a colorless and odorless gas.\n\nThe Dirty Faces campaign was unapologetically sponsored by shale gas company Chesapeake Energy. CEO Aubrey McClendon figured that he would do his part to help drive the coal industry out of business to drive up demand for natural gas, the current glut of which was caused by the technology breakthrough of fracking. Though cap-and-trade died in the last Congress, McClendon and Chesapeake are back to their anti-coal campaign, this time waging a proxy war through the American Lung Association.\n\nThe Obama administration is waging an all-out war against the coal industry though the EPA, the Department of the Interior, and the Mine Safety Administration. The EPA has enlisted paid allies like the American Lung Association to attack the coal industry and politicians that support it.\n\nAccording to the American Lung Association's 2010 report, Chesapeake Energy provided the funds that allowed the American Lung Association to create a new public service campaign (called \"Fighting for Air\"). It includes junk science-based fearmongering about premature deaths, asthma, and other heart and lung effects allegedly caused by ambient air quality. The Lung Association uses the campaign to help defend the EPA's war against coal.\n\nSo while Chesapeake fights environmentalist junk science on fracking, it actually funds junk science to use against its rivals. To some people this may make business sense, but it's shortsighted.\n\nHelping the EPA defeat coal will win the gas industry no brownie points. That's not how the all-powerful and unaccountable EPA needs to operate. Plus, Chesapeake is aiding and abetting enviro-radicals who, as soon as they have finished off the coal industry, will set their sights on shale gas. Divide-and-conquer is one of their bread-and-butter techniques.\n\nKnowing that the junk science war against fracking has just begun, it's more than frustrating to know that the frackers are willing to do the same to another innocent party.\n\nChesapeake's problem is not the coal industry. Its problem is the radical environmentalists who are purposefully blocking U.S. economic recovery and growth in part through their war against fossil fuel production. A growing economy would actually require more energy, including gas, and gas prices would rise as demand increased.\n\nWe need to develop all forms of energy: coal, gas, oil, nuclear, wind, solar, whatever. Energy is not the zero-sum game \u2014 swap coal for gas \u2014 that McClendon seems to think it is. And paying the enemy to employ junk science is not the right way to gain friends and influence people.\n\nLast Friday at Howard University, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) railed against the coal industry, saying, \"In [the coal industry's] entire history \u2013 50, 60, 70 years or even 30 \u2013 they never found the time or the reason to clean up their act. They're literally on life support. And the people keeping them on life support are all of us.\"\n\nThis is patently false, of course, as emissions from U.S. coal-fired power plants are quite heavily regulated. Those emissions controls are the reason U.S. air is clean and safe and why, say, the air in regulation-free China is not.\n\nAs West Virginia's Republican Rep. David B. McKinley pointed out, to the extent that the coal industry is \"on life support,\" it is Ms. Jackson's EPA and the rest of the Obama administration that has put it there with a slew of proposed and finalized anti-coal regulations.\n\nA week before, Ms. Jackson appeared on \"Real Time With Bill Maher,\" where she said, \"We're actually at the point in many areas of this country where, on a hot summer day, the best advice we can give you is don't go outside. Don't breathe the air, it might kill you.\"\n\nBut there is no scientific or medical evidence to support this statement \u2014 not now or even when the EPA was organized and the Clean Air Act was amended to its current form in 1970.\n\nAkin to shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater, her inflammatory rhetoric actually serves to undermine all the efforts put forth and money spent by government and industry to clean the air the past 40 years.\n\n\"Since the beginning of this year, Republicans in the House have averaged roughly a vote every day the chamber has been in session to undermine the Environmental Protection Agency and our nation's environmental laws. \u2026 How we respond to this assault on our environmental and public health protections will mean the difference between sickness and health \u2013 in some cases, life and death \u2014 for hundreds of thousands of citizens.\"\n\nBut the bills the House GOP has passed would do nothing more than delay a few proposed and recently issued EPA regulations pending a cost-benefit analysis, including input from other federal agencies. Long-standing, pre-Obama administration emissions standards would remain in effect without any changes.\n\nAn Oct. 16 USA Today op-ed co-signed with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stated, \"There shouldn't be a single neighborhood where parents have to worry about letting their kids play outside for fear they might get sick. Yet today, one in every 12 Americans \u2014 and one in 10 children \u2014 suffers from asthma, which is worsened by air pollution.\"\n\nThe good news is that there aren't such neighborhoods. In fact, there is no American adult or child whose health is compromised by ambient air quality. Yet reality doesn't temper Ms. Jackson's vitriol.\n\nAnd how many people does Ms. Jackson claim suffer avoidable deaths from particulate matter? She told Mr. Markey, \"If we could reduce particulate matter to healthy levels, it would have the same impact as finding a cure for cancer in our country.\"\n\nBut last year, about 570,000 people died from cancer amid a death toll of about 2.2 million. So Ms. Jackson is misleading Congress into thinking that 25 percent of deaths in America are caused by air pollution. The real toll from ambient air, however, is zero \u2013 and there is no scientific or medical evidence to the contrary.\n\nAll this shrillness is a sign that Ms. Jackson is feeling tremendous political pressure from her efforts to use junk science to shut down the American economy.\n\nShe has overreacted by borrowing from the playbook of Clinton EPA administrator and former Obama environment and energy czar Carol M. Browner, who ran roughshod not only over congressional Republicans but also over Al Gore in ramming through costly air-pollution regulations in 1997.\n\nWhatever the reason, however, Ms. Jackson's nonsensical Earth First!-like scaremongering is hardly befitting of a responsible senior government official who is in charge of a supposedly independent agency that regulates much of the nation's economy.\n\nMs. Jackson wants to be unaccountable for her actions and is trying to intimidate her critics into silence and resignation with flagrant falsehoods.\n\nAn EPA administrator whose rhetoric is as apocalyptic as that of the most strident environmental extremists \u2013 and whose agenda matches \u2013 isn't serving the public. At a time when it is more important than ever to avoid damaging the economy, Ms. Jackson's actions prove she isn't fit to serve.\n\nIs it too much to ask of medical journal editors to verify references for key claims? After all, just because a study author footnotes a claim, should that act automatically enshrine the claim with credibility?\n\n[Japanese] life expectancy increased rapidly throughout the 1950s and 60s as first infectious disease mortality dropped markedly, which was swiftly followed by stroke mortality falling. High blood pressure was also controlled through salt reduction campaigns and increased use of antihypertensive drugs and better health technologies. [Emphasis added]\n\nCurious about the salt reduction claim, I read the full article which spotlighted it in a summary box entitled \"Key Messages\":\n\nThe control of blood pressure improved through population-based interventions such as salt reduction campaigns\u2026\n\nThe text of the article went on to read,\n\nA reduction in dietary salt intake has been very important for the health improvement of the Japanese population. Average salt intake among middle-aged men decreased from 30 g\/day in the 1950s to 14 g\/day in the 1980s\u2026\n\nTwo factors that might be important in contributing to the falling trend in blood pressure in the population are the increased coverage of antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension and improved lifestyles that include reduced dietary salt intake.38\n\n\"Two factors that might be important\"? I though the article said that blood pressure was controlled by salt reduction. So I went to check out footnote 38, which directed me to the following study,\n\nIt didn't take long thereafter for The Lancet article's claim to begin to teeter. The abstract in Ikeda et al. stated,\n\nDeclining mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) in Japan between 1986 and 2002 was partly attributable to the increased use of antihypertensive medications, especially in the older population, and lowered mean BMI in young women. However, a substantial part of the decline was left unexplained and needs to be investigated further. A still greater decline in SBP would be expected through improvements in body weight management, salt and alcohol intake, and treatment and control of hypertension. [Emphasis added]\n\nSo lower blood pressure was linked with medications, not reduced salt intake, which only merited a hopeful \"would be expected.\"\n\nAdding detail to this observation, the Ikeda et al. study stated,\n\nReduced mean daily salt intake contributed [in a statistically significant manner] to the decline of mean SBP by \u22120.4 to \u22120.2 mmHg in all age groups in both sexes.\n\nBut SBP is meaningless on a population level, and fractional mmHg changes in SBP are miniscule and likely not even detectable on a clinical basis for an individual \u2014 after all, \"ideal\" SBP is on the order of 120 mmHg. It's no wonder that Ikeda et al. go on to acknowledge that,\n\nLifestyle-related factors such as physical activity, alcohol drinking and dietary salt intake made only limited contributions to the decline of mean SBP in this study.\n\nAnd even that assertion is an overstatement as there is no evidence that reducing dietary salt intake even made a \"limited\" contribution.\n\nSo The Lancet article makes a prominent claim that is actually debunked, as opposed to sustained, by its reference.\n\nThe added bizarre twist, here, is that Ikeda is the lead author of the article in The Lancet. So Ikeda debunked his own claim before he made it, but made it anyway, and then had the nerve to cite his prior debunking as support for the new claim.\n\nWe'll see if and how the media plays Ikeda's new article. But if you ever hear someone bloviating about how low-salt diets help the Japanese live longer, you'll know where the myth came from and how bogus it is.\n\nThatEveryone (including environmental zealots) agrees that the worst air-pollution episode ever to occur in the United States occurred in Donora, Pa., in October 1948.\n\nDaytime in Donora, late-October 1948\n\nFor three days, an unusual and stifling temperature inversion trapped noxious fumes from local industry in Donora's valley. By the time rain finally came to clear away the smog, thousands had been affected, hundreds had been sickened, and 20 elderly persons were dead. The Donora tragedy was a sentinel event on the path to the federal Clean Air Act that finally was enacted in 1963.\n\nIronically, though, when the Donora episode is studied rather than simply exploited as a rhetorical device, that debunks the EPA's assertion that present-day air quality is a killer.\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service investigated the Donora tragedy and in 1949 issued a report titled \"Air Pollution in Donora, Pa.: Epidemiology of the Smog Episode of October 1948.\"\n\nThe report indicates that the death rates for the period 1945-48 for Donora and nearby Pittsburgh were 826 and 1,086 per 100,000 people, respectively.\n\nSurprisingly, those mortality rates compare pretty well with the most recent mortality data for Allegheny County, Pa., home to both Donora and Pittsburgh.\n\nDuring the years 2006-08, Allegheny County's mortality rate was 1,110 per 100,000. And while mortality rate is one of the few objective public health statistics available, there's much more to this story than simply comparing then-and-now mortality rates.\n\nDonora's air quality was measured by the U.S. Weather Bureau from Feb. 16 to April 27, 1949 \u2013 i.e., more than three months after the October inversion and during what would be considered normal air-quality conditions in Donora.\n\nThe Weather Bureau's measurements of airborne particulate matter are astonishing and compelling. Of the 205 air samples taken at 12 stations during those 10 weeks in Donora, 54 percent exceeded 500 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nWhile the other 46 percent of the readings were less than 500 micrograms per cubic meter, it's likely that all of those were likely far greater than today's EPA's standard for maximum allowable fine particulate matter, which is 35 micrograms per cubic meter during a 24-hour period.\n\nIn contrast, Allegheny County violated this modern EPA standard just twice during 2007-09.\n\nSo, although the air in Allegheny County is much cleaner than it was in the years following World War II, the mortality rate is about the same.\n\nMoreover, the mortality rate in Donora from 1945-48 was 26 percent lower than the 2006-08 death rate in surrounding Allegheny County, despite the fact that the air was far dirtier as measured by the Weather Bureau in 1949, when more than half the time it exceeded the current EPA standard by a factor of 14 or more.\n\nSo what happened in Donora? The unusual inversion trapped toxic chemical fumes from facilities that did not cease operations until conditions had reached obviously toxic levels. The 20 elderly people who died in Donora (mean and median age 65) were all already suffering chronic heart and lung disease.\n\nAutopsies indicated that unknown substances caused the deaths, which the Public Health Service's report analogized to the World War I chemical weapon phosgene. There was no evidence that particulate matter caused any deaths.\n\nAlthough the Donora tragedy could not occur today because of stringent air-toxins regulations, modern emissions-control technology, vastly improved medical care and the societal wealth to afford it all, the EPA nonetheless likes to pretend that today's air quality is as poor and dangerous as it ever was and that we are all just one orange or red air-quality day away from death.\n\nThe agency's remedy is a slew of new regulations \u2013 such as its imminent ozone rule, which is estimated to be the most expensive regulation ever, costing $1 trillion annually in real compliance costs after 2020 and killing as many as 7.4 million actual jobs.\n\nIn November 1950, the Public Health Service's Donora report was reviewed in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which observed, \"There is need to know whether there is an insidious effect on those living their lifetime under an industrially polluted sky. Statistical studies of death rates in industrial cities are not sufficient. The situation requires the best in investigative medicine.\"\n\nWhile no one in America anymore lives under an \"industrially polluted sky,\" the call for \"investigative\" medicine 60 years ago still has not been answered. Instead, the EPA has spent tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars cooking up dubious statistical claims about air quality without ever checking to see if they match up with reality.\n\nIf the EPA seriously maintains that its existing and new air regulations are providing trillions of dollars' worth of health benefits, it should be compelled to produce hard medical evidence of those claimed benefits.\n\nSixty-three years ago, the Donora tragedy alerted society that air could become deadly in certain situations. It helped America choose a path toward the clean air we have now.\n\nWe can recycle the lesson of Donora. This time, however, we must make sure we don't allow an out-of-control EPA to wreck our economy and kill jobs with overly stringent regulations that only \"prevent\" imaginary deaths and illness at real and significant costs that we can't afford.\n\nThe bill would establish an \"Endocrine Disruption Expert Panel\" to advise the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences on banning chemicals.\n\nBut to be on the panel an \"expert\" must:\n\n\u2026 have received Federal endocrine-research-related funding within the 2 years preceding appointment under this subsection\u2026\n\nSo you can't be an expert unless you're at least partially-owned by the politicized federal agencies that want to ban chemicals like BPA in the first place. Astonishingly, a scientist's source of funding is what makes him expert, according to the Kerry-Moran bill.\n\nWhile the bill is unlikely to go anywhere due to probable Republican opposition, it does expose where Democrats want to take science and scientists.\n\nBut the United States banned the use of DDT in 1972 over the chemical's hazardous environmental impact. Studies have also linked DDT to diabetes and breast cancer. One examination of the consequences of using DDT to fight malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said the chemical might have increased infant deaths. [Emphasis added]\n\nI traced the diabetes claim to a study published in the July 2009 Environmental Health Perspectives. Aside from the usual fatal flaws of weak association epidemiology, this study's assertion that DDT metabolite DDE was associated with incident diabetes is laughable since the average body mass index (BMI) of the study subjects was 33.2 \u2014 e.g., meaning that the average study subject was likely to be obese (check out this chart to see what height\/weight combos make for a BMI of 33+).\n\nMoreover, no significant associations were reported for study subjects with a BMI less than 29.\n\nI don't know whether obesity leads to diabetes or diabetes leads to obesity, but there's no evidence that DDT is involved.\n\nThe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences study referred to by the New York Times doesn't even try to associate DDT with nonmalarial infant death. It instead only estimates nonmalarial deaths that may be associated with DDT spraying, the alleged \"association\" being based on three studies \"suggesting\" that DDT exposure may increase pre-term delivery and small-for-gestational-age births, and shorten the duration of lactation.\n\nSo contrary to the New York Times' assertion, there is no credible evidence that DDT has anything to do with diabetes, heart disease or infant deaths. Moreover, given that one million children under the age of five die every year from malaria, even if DDT did increase the risk of diabetes, breast cancer and infant death, those risks would be better than the alternative. While the Times misinforms millions are dying needlessly.\n\nIs American agriculture facing yet another major attack on food safety similar to the 1989 Alar scare?\n\nAt JunkScience.com, we take notice when certain tactics by activists and unscrupulous marketing interests repeat themselves. That is certainly the case right now vis-\u00e0-vis conventional crop protection products used by farmers and growing online advocacy and marketing campaigns seeking to tie these products to various human diseases and harms to our ecosystem.\n\nSpecifically, we're talking about campaigns targeting pesticides use to control weeds, insects, fungus and other risks to crop and farm animal health and productivity. American farmers often find themselves under the microscopes and in the gun sights of advocacy, litigator, niche and organic marketing and other special interest groups. Many of these interest groups have intersecting interests, shared tactics and even common resources they employ in these campaigns.\n\nThroughout 2010, we saw various signs that certain agriculture related special interest groups were organizing and putting in place the elements needed to engage in a major attack on conventional agriculture \u2014 specifically targeting crop protection pesticide products. Foundations with a history of funding anti-pesticide organizations were fueling research and activists seeking to show negative health and environmental associations with pesticides. We saw web domain names linked to pesticide issues being registered using privacy protection tools, research and travel funding funneled to activists and sympathetic academics, litigation filings targeting companies and their regulators, and related marketing investments by companies whose product sales benefit from food and health scares.\n\nIntertwined within these tactical components was an emerging allegory frequently repeated by activists and marketers setting the stage for defining villains, victims and heroes associated with their campaign. The villains \u2014 evil corporate agribusiness and toxic pesticides. The victims \u2014 vulnerable children and their mothers. The heroes \u2014 organic food and organic advocates to the rescue.\n\nIf we were seeing these signs in 2010 that meant the planning, funding and coordination for them most likely started in 2009 or earlier. These campaigns are detailed, extremely well funded and have multiple moving parts. One such marketing organization known for their past support of similar campaigns attacking competitors in food production recently tipped their hat and served as a proof point to the evolving picture of pending risk to traditional farmers we have been tracking.\n\nIn a very subtle, low visibility channel, the head of marketing for the Organic Valley Cooperative, a provider of organic dairy, meat and vegetables with more than a half billion dollars in annual sales, let it slip that Organic Valley was taking credit for an otherwise anonymous Web campaign attacking pesticide use.\n\nOrganic Valley chief marketing executive Theresa Marquez claimed in an April 4th blog post that their campaign, which had launched in January, had been in the works for the better part of two years and part of a broader Organic Valley funded effort to foster \"education\" about food safety issues in the marketplace.\n\nCalled \"Frog TV\" this campaign is cross-linked online directly and thematically with a much broader attack on pesticides and an emerging allegory with amphibians and children as the victims and chemical pesticide manufacturers as the villain.\n\nThis is junk science and fear profiteering at its peak. You see, the peer reviewed and actual scientific evidence says no one cause is linked to frog-related issues. And specifically, the synthetic pesticides attacked here by Organic Valley have been extensively researched, independently peer reviewed and found safe by government regulators around the globe.\n\nA recent Yale University study specifically noted, \"The findings upend the conventional wisdom that agricultural pesticides are largely responsible for the abnormalities.\" And, another independent, peer reviewed and published study by Oregon State University researchers similarly found, \"The search for a single causative factor is often missing the larger picture, they said, and approaches to address the crisis may fail if they don't consider the totality of causes \u2013 or could even make things worse.\"\n\nUnfortunately complex scientific interpretations don't suit the needs of fear profiteers like Organic valley. While this is just one small example, it reveals a dark side of organic promotions, sometimes called black marketing, which clearly seeks to create fears over less expensive conventionally produces foods in order to sell their higher priced offerings. And by all measures, these tactics appear to be back on the rise by organic marketing interests, advocacy groups and litigators. The last time we saw such high levels of attacks on conventional agriculture and specifically crop protection issues was the 1989 Alar cancer scare promoted by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).\n\nLest we forget, that Alar campaign was later exposed as a marketing and public relations campaign orchestrated to raise money and increase awareness and support for organic foods. According to the campaign architect David Fenton, \"The idea was for the 'story' to achieve a life of its own, and continue for weeks and months to affect policy and consumer habits.\"\n\nYears later, NRDC backtracked from the alarmist statements made by Janet Hathaway about Alar. NRDC's Hathaway had told CBS News in 1989, \"What we're talking about is a cancer causing agent used on food that the EPA knows is going to cause cancer for thousands of children\u2026\" Amending their position over ten years later, in a 2000 statement NRDC noted, \"The message of that report might have been muddled by the media, and the public might have over-reacted, because we never said there was an immediate danger from Alar\u2026\"\n\nHowever, the damage had been done. Their campaign cost the apple industry an estimated $150 million and an otherwise safe and effective crop production tool called Alar was removed from the market \u2014 not because of science-based regulatory processes, but through advocacy and market manipulations to promote organic foods by making people afraid of their more affordable conventional counterparts.\n\nAnd, it appears that we're seeing a similar type of well funded and orchestrated campaign emerging today again targeting conventional crop protection products. We are bombarded daily with claims, like those on Organic Valley's Frog TV, that children are getting cancer and other ills from pesticides. Frogs, bees and other species are mutating or collapsing \u2014 all of which will lead to end of human kind \u2013 because of pesticides and other agricultural practices. Less-than-transparent marketing and advocacy interests are spending millions of dollars to create these misperceptions for profits.\n\nAs with the Alar scare, the real victims of this current campaign will be farmers who may be forced to abandon well regulated, safe conventional crop protection products due to misplaced political decisions forced on regulators or market conditions created by public misperceptions generated by these campaigns. Consumers who face rising food costs or who are scared into spending more of their limited grocery budgets on higher priced organic products as a result of these scares will also suffer.\n\nThe signs are in place and coming soon to a theater, website, blog, Facebook page, etc\u2026 near you. Farmers and consumers should be prepared for a range of well constructed scare stories amplified by the media, activists and others raising alarms about what we eat and how its grown. We should not forget the lessons of the past, that repeatedly show these scares to be widely overblown with significant undisclosed special interests funding them. The real villains and victims here are much different than those we typically assume and read about online.\n\nConsider sending Organic Valley a message. Sign this petition and remember to send them and their organic trade association co-conspirators a message where they really feel it \u2014 at the supermarket by purchasing affordable non-organic food for your family.\n\n\"\u2026have built a fear campaign about the impacts of these investments, arguing that the costs are too great and the jobs created are too small.\"\n\nIf facts constitute a \"fear campaign,\" so be it. Let's examine CAP's arguments.\n\nCheaper than fossil fuel?\n\nCAP says that so-called \"clean energy,\" by which it means primarily wind and solar electricity generation, is actually less expensive than fossil fuel generation if you include the costs of fossil fuel's supposed \"externalities\" \u2014 i.e., air pollution and its alleged health consequences, forest fires, droughts etc. CAP estimates that the externalities of coal-fired electricity cost between $175 billion and $523 billion per year.\n\nBut as shown in \"EPA's Clean Air Act: Pretending air pollution is worse than it is\" (JunkScience.com, March 2011), air pollution is largely a thing of the past in the vast majority of the U.S. In areas where air quality may occasionally be problematical, mainly California, such events are mainly due to vehicle emissions (i.e., not electricity generation) and California's particular topography and weather. Moreover, there are no coal-fired power plants in California. So the claim that emissions from coal-fired plants cause any health problems and associated health costs whatsoever lies somewhere in the continuum of wrong-to-pretend.\n\nThe forest fire and drought arguments harken back to the famously disproven and disavowed connection between manmade carbon dioxide emissions and weather-related events. But as IPCC and Climategate honcho Kevin Trenberth has admitted and the British judge who trashed Al Gore's \"An Inconvenient truth\" ruled, for example, climate change and weather events are entirely independent of each other.\n\nWhat we do know \u2014 and this is undisputed \u2014 is that electricity from wind and solar sources is so expensive that without government subsidies, it would not exist, let alone compete with fossil fuels. At a Senate hearing last week, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) asked a \"clean energy\" venture capitalist:\n\n\"If it wasn't for the credits you're receiving, would you be in business?\"\n\nThe answer was no, according to Climatewire. CAP admits as much in its report, citing the success of several \"clean energy\" welfare programs.\n\n'Clean energy' not subject to the 'broken windows fallacy'?\n\nAs described by CAP,\n\nThis brings us to the second erroneous criticism of clean energy critics: that clean energy actually costs jobs by destroying productive capital and robbing jobs from other sectors of the economy. Their argument is that clean energy jobs are an example of the famous economic observation known as the \"Broken Windows Fallacy.\" In the classic telling of this economic lesson, a vandal breaks the window of a shop. The shopkeeper then has to replace the window, and calls the glassmaker, who then has more business. While the new business is good for the glassmaker, economists point out that this has not created a \"net new job,\" but has simply moved employment around in the economy. After all, if the shopkeeper didn't have to spend money on the new window, he would have spent it on something else that he's now foregoing.\n\nCAP dismisses the broken window fallacy argument as follows:\n\nBut this criticism applies only if a broken window is replaced with another identical window. But in the transition to a cleaner energy economy, we are talking about replacing that first broken window with a much more efficient one\u2014perhaps one with double-paned glass, or even glass with solar reflectors on it to store heat from the sun. Or maybe we're talking about replacing a 40-year-old, coal-fired power plant with a geothermal plant, or a new wind or solar farm. The \"broken window\" analogy simply does not work when the window you start with is flawed. We're replacing an outdated window with a new, more efficient one that costs less to operate.\n\nBut if CAP's argument was correct and there was significant value to be had in knee-jerk replacement of old windows with new windows, then shopkeepers would break their own windows and become richer. The notion that there's some sort of automatic economic benefit from replacing a coal-fired power plants with wind farms is disproven by the economic reality that utilities \u2014 which provide 45 percent of our electricity by burning coal versus slightly more than one (1) percent through wind, and which have no ideological preference for coal over any other fuel \u2014 choose to use coal, even with all its accompanying regulatory costs, because of its affordability and reliability.\n\nWhether rational people are replacing windows or power plants, they will only do so if they are getting some value out of the replacement. That value doesn't necessarily have to be purely economic (at least in the case of windows); it could be aesthetic. But wind and solar are not being pressed on us because of their aesthetic values; it's their alleged economic and environmental benefits of which we are regaled. But there is no real world evidence that the latter exist now or will come to pass in the foreseeable future.\n\nJob hypocrisy?\n\nFinally, CAP takes an ironic swipe at the job efficiency. It's not true, CAP claims, that it takes more workers to produce a given amount of energy from \"clean energy\" versus fossil fuels. CAP is apparently saying that \"clean energy\" can be as, or even more \"job efficient\" than fossil fuels \u2014 i.e., \"clean energy\" requires a comparable number of, or perhaps fewer jobs than fossil fuels to generate the same amount of power.\n\n\"\u2026 dirty energy opponents argue that green jobs are a myth, and aren't actually new jobs. This is wrong because building clean energy creates new installation, construction, and manufacturing jobs immediately, and then frees up resources to create jobs and growth in the rest of the economy.\n\nBut of course, the U.S. has already \"invested\" about $80 billion in \"clean energy\" via the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Where are the jobs?\n\nGiven that a \"clean energy standard\" could easily become a carbon cap (as in the economy-killing cap-and-trade), it important to make sure that policymakers understand the truth about \"clean energy\" before the carbon cap that we have worked hard to avoid since the 1990s is snuck in place via junk economics."}

{"text":"Light pollution is the term used to describe the overabundance of light in urban areas. From cars, buildings, and street lights, it's almost like it never gets dark in the city. And it turns out that this affects air pollution, as well.\n\nAfter measuring the air around the infamously polluted city of Los Angeles, scientists discovered that the extra light during the evening was actually worsening the air pollution. This is because a certain chemical--known as a nitrate radical--that breaks down air pollution, is only active at night, because it's destroyed by light. But when it never really gets dark, the nitrate radical doesn't have an opportunity to do its job.\n\n\"Our first results indicate that city lights can slow down the night-time cleansing by up to 7% and they can also increase the starting chemicals for ozone pollution the next day by up to 5%,\" Harald Stark, from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told the BBC.\n\nOne proposed solution wouldn't see the removal of lights all together, but instead have them pointed away from the sky so as to not affect the nitrate radical"}

Health - Indoor air pollution can impact our health both immediately, with symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and eye, nose, or throat irritation resulting from as little as a single exposure, or over an extended time frame. Respiratory disease, heart disease, and cancer are examples of conditions that may occur or be exacerbated with extended or repeated exposure to polluted indoor air.\n\nAirZone tests for Particle Allergens, Chemical Pollutants, Carbon Dioxide, and Radon to ensure that your health is not being negatively affected by the air you are breathing at home.\n\n2. Comfort - In addition to discomfort associated with temperature, humidity, and \"stuffy air\" (carbon dioxide) problems, surveys show that consumers link poor indoor air quality with quality of life in general. For example, 48% of asthma sufferers feel that the disease limits their ability to take part in sports and recreation; 25% say it interferes with their social activities. It has been revealed that health related IAQ complaints\u2014such as coughing, sneezing, burning eyes, increased asthma symptoms, etc.\u2014often coincide with complaints about smells, dust build-up, and heating or cooling system problems.\n\nAirZone monitors the interior and exterior temperature and relative humidity over a minimum of three days.\n\n3. Safety - Carbon monoxide levels are a cause for concern when average levels are above 5 ppm (8-hour average). When levels (8-hour average) are above 20 ppm, immediate action should be considered. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas produced by combustion. When people are exposed to relatively low levels (for an 8 hour period or more), it can cause headaches and nausea. At relatively high levels it can cause memory problems and ultimately death.\n\nAirZone tests the carbon monoxide levels in your home. We also recommend a detector be installed for future monitoring, and would be happy to suggest a monitor and placement.\n\nExample page from one of our IAQ reports appreciated"}
{"text":"Evacuation not automatically best for health during chemical incidents\n\nSheltering at home may be more appropriate than evacuation for protecting the health of local residents close to chemical air pollution incidents, says a paper in this week's BMJ.\n\nIn the first study of its kind, researchers compared the effects of both sheltering and evacuation on the local population during a fire at a Devon plastics factory which resulted in hazardous chemicals released into the surrounding environment.\n\nDuring the first six hours, many of the local residents were evacuated. But it was then decided that remaining residents should stay in their homes. Researchers looked at the number of 'cases' in both groups - i.e. those experiencing symptoms related to the incident.\n\nThey found that soon after the fire, the evacuated group had almost twice as many cases as compared with those in the sheltered group (19.7% compared to 9.5%), though the difference did not seem to persist after two weeks (3.3% compared to 1.9%).\n\nThe study was based on a health survey involving 1096 residents in the town, 797 of whom were sheltered and 299 evacuated. Both evacuated and sheltered sets of residents lived similar average distances from the factory (565m and 572m respectively).\n\nThe effects of severe chemical air pollution are similar to those of respiratory illness, say the authors - cough, for instance, or runny eyes. To distinguish cases - those whose symptoms were incident-related - they compared how many of these symptoms were typically suffered by a neighbouring community unaffected by the fire, with those in the affected town. With an average of 0.48 symptoms per person in the nearby town, the researchers defined a case in the affected town as someone with at least 4 symptoms.\n\nThe authors stress that there were several limitations with this study, including a lack of data on whether the level and nature of the smoke exposure could have been different between the groups"}

{"text":"Acid Articles\n\nAcid Rain Affects Large Swathes of China\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Acid rain caused by sulphur dioxide spewed from factories and power plants affected a third of China's vast land mass last year, posing a threat to food safety, Xinhua news agency said citing a parliamentary report.\nMore than half of the 696 cities and counties monitored had suffered acid rain, in some cases on a daily basis, according to a pollution inspection report submitted to the standing committee of parliament, the official agency said.\n\"Increased sulphur dioxide emissions meant that one third of China's territory was affected by acid rain, posing a major threat to soil and food safety,\" Xinhua cited NPC standing committee vice chairman Sheng Huaren as saying.\nDischarge of sulphur dioxide in booming China rose by 27 percent between 2000 and 2005 to 25 million tonnes, making the country the world's top emitter of the pollutant.\nSheng told lawmakers that China's sulphur dioxide emissions, caused largely by coal-burning power stations and coking plants, were double the acceptable environmental limit.\nAccording to the report's findings, nearly 650 out of 680 coking plants in Shanxi, the country's main coal-mining province, discharged excessive sulphur dioxide, Xinhua said.\nAir pollution, caused mainly by sulphur dioxide and particulate matter, was affecting some 40 percent of Chinese cities, Sheng said.\nChina has pledged to install desulphurisation facilities in coal-burning power plants and is planning pilot emissions trading schemes to help improve air quality.\nThe capital, Beijing, has promised to replace its notorious smog with clear skies in time for the 2008 Olympics.\nIn the same parliamentary report, Sheng also lifted the lid on false reporting of solid waste discharge levels by local governments and companies.\nActual levels of toxic chromium waste in China could be as high as five million tons instead of the 4.1 million reflected in official figures, Xinhua cited the report as saying.\n\"Many firms report a lower figure for chromium waste for fear of being punished,\" Sheng said.\nOne locality had originally reported that it had 3,000 tons of chromium waste but raised the figure to 100,000 tons after learning the government would build reprocessing facilities for them instead of fining them, he said.\n\nRecovery of Lake Offers Hope for Acid Rain-Ravaged Region\n\nALBANY, N.Y. \u2014 A crystalline Adirondack lake once held up as an example of a \"dead\" lake devastated by acid rain has now become a symbol of nature's ability to heal itself once pollutants are curbed.\n\nAs the name implies, Brooktrout Lake teemed with trout before air pollution from faraway cities began to change the chemistry of lakes and soils in the 6-million-acre Adirondack Park. In 1984, biologists found that Brooktrout Lake and hundreds of others in the rugged region were completely devoid of fish.\nNow there are signs of recovery. After the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 tightened emissions limits on Midwest coal-burning power plants, acid rain decreased significantly. As expected, the pH levels of Adirondack lakes began to rise, becoming less acidic. The surprising thing was how fast it happened.\n\"Nobody predicted Brooktrout Lake would come around as fast as it has,\" said Clifford Siegfried, director of the New York State Museum and a freshwater ecologist who has studied Adirondack lakes since 1984. \"Most predictions were for decades of recovery.\"\nLast fall, biologists stocked Brooktrout Lake with 20 adult trout and 2,000 fingerling trout. It was the first time a once-dead Adirondack lake had been restocked with fish after improving enough to sustain fish.\nThe stocking isn't for the benefit of anglers, but scientists.\n\"This is a whole lake experiment, an ecological experiment of the highest order,\" said Charles Boylen, a biologist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Darrin Fresh Water Institute. He has studied Adirondack lakes since 1994 under a $7 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\"This is a great opportunity to see how nature deals with this phenomenon of acid recovery,\" he said.\nThis spring, researchers returned with sonar equipment to see how the fish fared after the snowmelt flooded the lake with a winter's worth of acid deposits. The fish survived. \"We're all primed for a productive season,\" Boylen said.\nThe researchers will visit the lake every few weeks to observe the fish to see if they reproduce and grow. And they'll monitor the entire ecosystem of the lake to document changes in plankton, algae, plants, insects, loons, salamanders and other species as the natural balance returns.\nFor ecologists, it will be interesting to watch what happens to the naturally recovering flora and fauna with the introduction of trout, Siegfried said. \"These communities have adapted to having no fish for several decades. The top predator is the midge larva,\" a wriggler the size of an eyelash. \"These are nice juicy morsels for trout. They'll likely wipe out that population.\"\nScientists also will be watching the behavior of a pair of loons that have been nesting on the lake for years. In the past, they've had to go to another lake to feed. Now they'll find trout right at home. \"We'll see how that affects fish survival,\" Siegfried said. \"They can eat 1,500 fish annually.\"\nSampling must be done numerous times over the course of each year because the lake changes significantly from week to week. The acid level is affected by precipitation and temperature, and the abundance of certain organisms rises and falls over short periods.\nCollecting samples isn't easy. The trail to Brooktrout Lake is six miles long, and equipment has to be carried in. A state helicopter is sometimes used to make the job easier.\nThe recovery of Brooktrout Lake may be short-lived, however. Tim Sullivan of E & S Environmental Chemistry in Corvallis, Ore., was contracted by New York state to develop mathematical models that predict what will happen in response to various levels of air pollutant emissions. The outlook isn't good.\n\"While there has been a substantial decrease in acid deposition, the improvement in lake chemistry has been relatively small,\" Sullivan said. \"If we continue to operate under existing emissions regulations, the lakes that have been recovering will stop recovering and will start to get worse again over the next couple of decades. For some lakes, it will be worse than it ever has been.\"\nThat's because soils in the Adirondacks, particularly at higher elevations, have been depleted of calcium and other acid-neutralizing minerals, weakening their ability to serve as a buffer against acid rain, Sullivan said.\nTo prevent reacidification of the region's most sensitive lakes, such as Brooktrout, further emission controls are needed, he said.\n\"Recovery is a dangerous word in the hands of politicians. They think the job is done,\" Boylen said. \"But even with more stringent regulations, there's still more consumption of fossil fuels than in years past. If we don't learn to conserve our energy consumption or rely on sources other than fossil fuels, the societal demands will continue to put more and more emissions into the atmosphere.\"\n\nAcid Drainage Killing Some Fish in Kentucky\n\nPIKEVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Drainage from land disturbed by mining and road construction has caused acid levels to rise beyond acceptable levels in portions of at least 35 streams across the state, killing fish and insects.\nThat finding is part of a report by the Kentucky Division of Water, which is trying to prevent the acid drainage so that the streams might once again support aquatic life.\nAcid drainage is especially of concern in areas where coal and shale have been unearthed, said Andrea M. Fredenburg, environmental control supervisor in the Division of Water.\n\"When those layers are exposed to water, we get the problem,\" she said.\nMost of the streams with high acid levels are in the coalfields. For example, seven streams in McCreary County in southeastern Kentucky have been affected as have five streams in Muhlenberg County. The list is expected to grow when acid levels are tested in streams in the Big Sandy River watershed, where coal mining is widespread.\nOther counties that had streams on the impacted list were Bell, Clay, Hancock, Harlan, Hopkins, Knox, Letcher, Marion, McLean, Ohio and Pulaski.\nMaleva Chamberlain, spokeswoman for the Division of Water, said the list of streams is part of a water quality report that is sent to Congress every two years as required by the federal Clean Water Act.\nAll streams deemed unfit for fishing or swimming because of pollution are included in the report. In Kentucky, the most common reason streams make the list is because of high concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria, which comes from animal and human waste.\nIn eastern Kentucky, authorities blame the high bacteria concentration on so-called straight pipes, used by some people to flush commodes directly into streams without the benefit of septic tanks and sewage treatment plants.\nChamberlain said the Division of Water doesn't stop after determining that a stream is polluted, whether by bacteria or acid drainage.\n\"We looked at where it is coming from, and now we look at how we are going to stop it,\" she said.\n\nEarthTalk: What is 'Acid Rain' and What Causes It?\n\nDear EarthTalk: What is \"acid rain\" and what causes it?\n-- Jeff Ohmberger, Lincoln, NE\n\"Acid rain,\" also known as acid precipitation and acid deposition, is a broad term used to describe the nitric and sulfuric acids that fall to Earth during rain, snow or fog. These chemicals form in our atmosphere to begin with when pollutants released into the air through the burning of fossil fuels blend with other substances, including water vapor. When it storms, these substances return to the Earth s surface where they get into rivers, streams and groundwater, literally making these waters more acidic.\nThis acidity, in turn, damages trees and other plant life and makes it difficult for wildlife--especially aquatic life--to thrive and reproduce. The consequences of acid rain can also be seen in the cracks and discoloration on some building surfaces and on the smoothed and faded facial features on outdoor statues.\nEmissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) are primarily to blame. While volcanoes and other natural sources produce these chemicals, too, as much as 95 percent of the SO2 and NOx emitted in North America comes from industrial sources and the tailpipes of cars and trucks.\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency s (EPA) Acid Rain Program, the highest concentrations of acid rain in the U.S. are in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Prevailing winds move large masses of pollutants there from the smokestacks of the many coal-fired and other kinds of power plants dotting the banks of the Ohio River.\nMeanwhile, the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), which monitors the chemistry of precipitation at some 200 locations around the United States, reports high levels of acid rain throughout the entire Northeast, extending from Indiana all the way to the Atlantic coast. NADP s website features interactive maps detailing acid rain concentrations nationwide.\nDuring the 1980s, public outcry over acid rain resulted in Congress amending the Clean Air Act to impose limits on industrial emissions of SO2 and NOx. While the regulations have helped, many environmentalists think more needs to be done in order to protect plants, wildlife and water throughout the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada. A growing body of evidence shows that without significant additional cuts in acid rain-forming emissions, many of the problems associated with acid rain will persist for many decades, says Ellen Baum, ecosystem expert at the Boston-based nonprofit organization, Clean Air Task Force.\nSince the burning of fossil fuels accounts for most of the troublesome SO2 and NOx emissions, individuals can make a difference by reducing their energy consumption at home and by driving fewer miles in their internal combustion vehicles. Businesses can take similar steps by increasing energy efficiency at the workplace and encouraging employees to carpool or take public transit.\n\nScientists to Study Acid Rain, Smokies\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Scientists plan to study soil this spring in high elevations of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park -- the area most affected by acid rain and other environmental problems, officials say.\nThe Smokies' suffer from some of the worst acid rain problems in the U.S., especially after major rains or snow melts when streams and rainwater in the higher elevations become more acidic than normal.\nAcid rain results when sulfur and nitrogen byproducts from fossil fuel-burning plants, industries and motorized vehicles combine with water vapor to form weak acid.\nThe study will target sites examined by the Environmental Protection Agency in the 1980s, enabling scientists to see how the soils have changed.\n\"We have been studying the effects of acid deposition on streams, and now we're looking at soils,\" said Michael Jenkins, a forest ecologist for the Smokies. \"We're filling in another piece of the puzzle.\"\nTo study the soil, scientists will dig down to the bedrock at four high-elevation sites located on the Tennessee and North Carolina sides of the 500,000-acre park.\nThe four sites are above 4,000 feet where acid rain and polluted cloud water cause some of the worst acid deposition problems, which the park began monitoring more than 20 years ago.\n\"Changes in the soil chemistry have a cascading effect that impacts the plants and trees -- and ultimately the animals that rely on them,\" Jenkins said."}

{"text":"Jan 30, 2013\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014Particulate matter from the summer's devastating High Park Fire exceeded some of the worst air pollution days in Mexico City or Los Angeles over the past decade, say Colorado State University researchers, who are giving scientists additional quantitative data on the fire's impact.\n\n\"Not only was the air pollution some of the highest we've seen in decades in Colorado during the fire, its toxic strength rivaled the worst days we see in those cities,\" said John Volckens, a professor of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences who conducted the study with Chuck Henry, a professor of Chemistry. \"On days before the High Park Fire, the air pollution levels were some of the cleanest in the country.\"\n\nResearchers took the toxicity measurements with a small, inexpensive test devices made from paper they created and attached to individuals who wore them for the duration of the fire. The device, worn on the shoulder, measured oxidative intake of particulate air pollution - otherwise known as the ability of inhaled particles to cause stress within the body.\n\n\"It lives on your shoulder, it's tiny and it breathes the same air you're breathing, so at the end of the day, if you were outside more often on a bad fire day, you'd have more oxidative intake,\" Henry said. \"Particulate air pollution has the potential to cause oxidative stress in our bodies, which is one of the reasons it's healthy to eat antioxidants as part of our diet. Oxidative stress potential is a new genre of air pollution measurement \u2013 and the beauty of this technology is that it's low-cost and simple.\"\n\nThe device could help scientists better understand the effects of air pollution on people. Knowing how individuals are affected could help researchers understand how pollution leads to disease over a person's lifetime and how to target the sources of pollution that cause the most harm.\n\nVolckens and Henry recently published a study in Environmental Science and Technology that describes this new measurement technology and how they measured oxidative air pollution on Fort Collins residents during the High Park Fire in June 2012. The paper is available at  .\n\n\"We have different lifestyles, different sources of air pollution in our homes and live in different proximity to major sources of air pollution in our homes,\" Henry said. \"We've always looked at air pollution from 30,000 feet. Monitoring the individual could also help people know when they're inhaling pollutants or bringing them home from work.\"\n\n\"When we understand where we're getting our air pollution exposures, we can control those sources or modify our behaviors so we get lower exposures,\" Volckens said. \"Not all air pollution is created equally for everyone. Diesel exhaust may be worse than wood smoke. Industrial dust is worse than things like sea spray or biogenic particles we find in pristine forests. We can use this technology to measure the relative toxicity of different types of air pollution \u2013 it helps us prioritize which forms of air pollution may be worse.\"\n\nHenry and Volckens said their next steps are to create a network of citizen scientists who could test the devices and help them create a map of air pollution levels around the city.\n\n\"We're hoping to advance this technology even more in the next year or two,\" Volckens said.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nAs Asian countries develop, they are emitting more ozone precursors that pollute surface level air.

{"text":"Radon Health Risks\n\nProlonged exposure to high concentrations of radon gas is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers. For smokers, the risk of developing lung cancer is dramatically increased when exposed to even moderate concentrations of radon gas. According to the Surgeon General, not enough citizens are aware of the dangers or consider themselves at risk. Over the past decade, the EPA and dozens of other organizations including the American Lung Association, have escalated public awareness campaigns to educate both adults and children to the health risks associated with radon gas.\n\nAccording to the EPA, studies find direct evidence linking radon in homes to lung cancer - Two studies show definitive evidence of an association between residential radon exposure and lung cancer. Two studies, a North American study and a European study, both combined data from several previous residential studies. These two studies go a step beyond earlier findings. They confirm the radon health risks predicted by occupational studies of underground miner's who breathed radon for a period of years. Early in the debate about radon-related risks, some researchers questioned whether occupational studies could be used to calculate risks from exposure to radon in the home environment. \"These findings effectively end any doubts about the risks to Americans of having radon in their homes,\" said Tom Kelly, Director of EPA's Indoor Environments Division. \"We know that radon is a carcinogen.

{"text":"Air Quality\n\nMany studies have been conducted around the world into the importance of good quality indoor air.\n\nThere are a number of factors to be taken into account in ensuring good quality indoor air is always present in your home.\n\nThe first key point is to ensure that fresh air can always be brought into your home, in some cases a pleasant summer breeze can do this in well designed houses, taking advantage of cross flow ventilation.\n\nOften it is not possible to design a house to fully take advantage of cross-flow ventilation, and then one needs help to get the air moving into your home. Even in well designed houses simply opening a window may not be enough if there is only a small temperature difference between inside and out, or if there is no wind blowing.\n\nThis is where roof vents, with openings into the living space can help bring that outside air into your home.\n\nThe other main point to consider is moisture removal from the attic and sub-floor of your house. If these areas are well ventilated this will prevent the growth of mould and mildew which can contribute significantly to poor indoor air quality."}
{"text":"Reasons to Improve Indoor Air Quality in Childcare Facilities\n\nA first-of-its-kind study of the indoor air quality of 40 childcare centers in California finds that most concentrations of contaminants in the air are well within state and federal guidelines, although a few chemicals such as formaldehyde substantially exceeded guidelines.\n\nThomas McKone and Randy Maddalena of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) participated in the study, which was led by Asa Bradman and researchers in the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health, School of Public Health. McKone has a joint appointment at the School of Public Health and in Berkeley Lab's Environmental Energy Technologies Division (EETD), and Maddalena is a scientist in EETD.\n\n\"Although most of the VOCs that we commonly measure indoors are similar in childcare facilities and other indoor environments like homes and schools, our findings suggest that there are a lot more chemicals in the air than what we commonly measure. In addition to the target VOCs in our study, we identified over a hundred other VOCs in the air, many of which do not have reference exposure levels.\" says Maddalena.\n\nThe study is the first to provide a detailed analysis of environmental contaminants and exposures for children in early childhood education facilities (ECE). ECE facilities include home-based childcare providers, private for-profit or non-profit preschools, and programs run by government agencies and religious institutions.\n\nThe study was funded by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which provides guidance on its website about how childcare centers can reduce the concentration of these chemicals in the air. One of CARB's responsibilities is to regulate the emissions of indoor air pollutants in California.\n\nVolatile organic compounds in the air\n\nThe researchers measured more than 40 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air of these facilities, although, they say, \"most concentrations were usually below levels of concern.\" Common sources of VOCs are cleaners and personal care products.\n\nHowever, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, chloroform, and benzene, or ethylbenzene exceeded child-specific Safe Harbor Levels. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are known respiratory irritants and carcinogens.\n\nIt is important to better understand the impact of these concentrations. According to the report, \"because children exhibit exploratory behaviors that place them in direct contact with contaminated surfaces, they are likely to be exposed to any contaminants present. Children have higher exposures because they breathe more air, eat more food, and drink more water per unit of body weight compared to adults. They are also less developed immunologically, physiologically, and neurologically and therefore may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of chemicals and toxins.\"\n\nFormaldehyde concentrations in the air exceeded reference exposure levels in 35 of the facilities. It is typically emitted from furniture containing composite wood products like plywood, fiberboard, or particle board, but it can be emitted from other indoor sources including carpets and carpet pads; paints and coatings; permanent press clothing, furniture fabrics, and draperies; personal care products; and indoor combustion sources such as gas ranges and fireplaces.\n\n\"More research needs to be conducted on the understanding the health risks posed by indoor environmental contaminants in these facilities,\" says Maddalena. \"We also need to identify better strategies to reduce indoor sources of these chemicals.\"\n\nSome of CARB's recommended strategies for reducing formaldehyde in the air include:\n\nPurchase products containing little or no formaldehyde.\n\nUse ventilation systems and open windows.\n\nClean frequently to minimize dust, using a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter or a wet mop for hard surface floors.\n\nClean out cabinets and garages to eliminate older pesticides, solvents and cleaning products that may leak, in order to help reduce indoor levels of pesticides and harmful chemicals.\n\nAssure adequate ventilation to bring in outdoor air.\n\nThe study's authors are Asa Bradman, Fraser Gaspar, Rosemary Castorina, Elodie Tong-Lin, Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health, University of California \u2013 Berkeley, Thomas McKone, School of Public Health and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Randy Maddalena, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory."}

{"text":"7 Steps to Creating a Healthy Nursery\nCreate a healthy and safe home for your children before they arrive. Look at the environment the child will be spending most of their time, and select the appropriate materials and finishes to furnish that space. This will go a long way toward providing your children a nurturing and toxin free environment.\n\n1. Indoor Air Quality\nAir quality standards have been set for the workplace, there are virtually no standards required for residential construction and remodels. People spend between 80% and 90% of their time indoors, maintaining optimum Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is imperative to the health of your family.\n\nImprovements in residential design over the past few decades have increased the efficiency of our homes and decreased the amount of energy used for heating and cooling. The amount of exterior air infiltrating into the homes has decreased dramatically. Air Quality experts have scientific data indicating the air inside our homes is substantially more polluted that the air outside.\n\nPractical and Healthy Habits:\n\nOpen Windows Daily. 10-15 minutes to release stale air and contaminants.\n\nChange Filter on Furnace. Filters that are used beyond their recommended time will be re-circulating dust and pollutants back into the house. Change filters as recommended by manufacturers.\n\nNatural fiber area rugs can be used. Periodically remove and sanitize with a non-toxic cleaner.\n\nCarpeting is not recommended \u2013 It traps any contaminants that enter the room, including material that arrives on the bottoms of shoes. Although manufacturers are producing carpeting of natural fibers with non-toxic backing; the majority of carpets on the market are manufactured using toxic flame retardants, chemical stain resistors, and synthetic fibers.\n\nA study by the EPA showed that some of the chemicals emitted from new carpets include toluene and xylene, both neurotoxins, benzene, a human carcinogen, and styrene, an irritant and suspected carcinogen.\n\nCommercial carpet cleaners may use extremely toxic chemicals that can cause neurological and respiratory damage. You don't want to live in a room with these chemicals, and you especially don't want a small child crawling on them.\n\n3. Walls and Ceilings\nMany homes built before the mid 1970's have asbestos in them. The familiar \"popcorn\" ceilings are an indication that there may be asbestos present. If an expensive and disruptive asbestos abatement is not in the budget, and the asbestos has not been disturbed, it is recommended that the ceiling be left alone. However, if any new construction work is to be done, an asbestos removal company should perform the work. Generally a permit is required from your municipality to do this work.\n\nThe room should be inspected for mold. Look for discoloration or water stains on the sheetrock or plaster. Indications are usually found around windows, exterior doors, on the ceiling, and where the walls meet the floor and ceiling. If any mold is present, it should be removed and the source of the water penetration found and repaired.\n\n4. Paints and Finishes\nAs recently as a few years ago there were few choices available for low VOC (volatile organic compound) paint. Now many of the established paint manufacturers provide low voc and no voc paints. The new paint smell that we are all accustomed to is the result of chemicals being released as the paint is drying. We don't want to release chemicals into our homes. One thing to be aware of is that while some of the base paint (the white base to which color is added) may be no VOC the colors added can contain the chemicals. It is best to check with the manufacturer and\/or paint supplier. Several other no-VOC finishes are available, including lime based paints and plaster, clay based paints and plaster, Venetian plaster, and milk paints.\n5. Furniture\nNow it's time to put furniture into the room. For cribs and beds choose wood, constructed out of reclaimed material or FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified lumber, or bamboo, which is a sustainable, durable material. Avoid any products made of particle board or MDF, which contain chemical glues and bonding agents. Mattresses made with wool are naturally fire retardant and don't need to be treated with chemicals. Natural latex foam, made from the sap of rubber trees, breaths much more than synthetic foam, which comes from petroleum. Synthetic foam accumulates moisture which attracts mites and mildew. Latex foam is naturally anti-bacterial and resists mold and mildew. For linens, pillows, comforters, towels, choose natural untreated cotton or wool for pesticide and chemical free fabrics, colored with plant based dyes.\n\n6. Toys\nMake sure that the toys for your child are completely safe. It is difficult today to find products that are not made overseas. However it is well worth the effort to do the research and to make sure that the country of origin has health and safety laws that are as stringent, better yet more stringent, than those of the United States. The material used and the finishes applied to toys can be very toxic. Recently many toys from the major toy manufacturers were recalled because they contained lead paint. Buy products that are made from natural materials, using natural finishes. Make sure that any plastic toys are made of HDPE (high density polyethylene). It is considered the safest plastic around. Many of these toys are made from recycled milk containers.\n\nIf you have toys from your childhood or from your parents' childhood, family heirlooms or antiques, and don't know what they are made of or what the finishes contain, have them evaluated or use them as decorations. Don't put them in contact with your children.\n7. Buying Local\nWhen making any purchase, for yourself or your child, buy from local sources. This supports your community and America. It is an unfortunate fact that the large manufacturers have moved their production facilities to countries with the cheapest labor costs, and the least stringent environmental standards. They sell products to improve their bottom line, not necessarily the health and welfare of the people buying their products. There are many companies in this country that produce safe, beautiful"}

Even fairly loose particles that have settled on the floor are easily crushed into very small particles and redistributed back into the air. These airborne particles then get carried into the critical area where they present a potential hazard.\n\nFine Particles\n\nSome of the important general properties of fine particles can be summarised as follows:\n\nThey move with the air in which they are suspended.\n\nDue to gravity they settle out of the air slowly and can remain airborne for long periods of time.\n\nAs they settle, they risk contacting and contaminating critical products and processes.\n\nThe small, light, particles (<5um) normally invisible to the naked eye are commonly called Airborne Molecular Contaminants (AMCs) or Ultra Fine Particles (UFP's). They can become suspended for hours in the surrounding environment where they quickly spread polluting the atmosphere.\n\nMany of us have personal experience of allergies.

There\nwas, he pointed out, worldwide \"a high correlation between exposure to\ntraffic fumes and particular cancers\".\n\nDr. Wei, who is attached to the Department of Chemistry at Cleveland\nUniversity - Ohio, is researching air pollution in Sri Lanka, while also\nteaching and developing the M.Sc curriculum in Environmental and Industrial\nChemistry at the University of Kelaniya. He was speaking at the Earth Day\nprogramme organised by the U.S Embassy in Colombo last week.\n\nA scientist dedicated to increasing knowledge and public awareness on\npollution, Dr Wei warned of the high levels of carcinogenic chemicals in\nthe air. Although the chemistry of the most hazardous particles from car\nfumes - polycydic aromatic hydrocarbons - (known as PAHs) is complex, and\nthe exact nature of its interaction with humans is still being deciphered,\nwhat is clear, is that pollution from cars is a danger to humans.\n\nExpanding on Colombo's pollution problems, Dr. Wei said one of the most\neffective ways to minimize this risk is to keep vehicles properly maintained\nto reduce the amount of toxic waste released into the air.\n\nHe stressed the need for further research and campaigning action in\nthis area pointing to the success of anti-leaded fuel campaigns in the\nUS and Europe, where people lobbied the authorities after it was proven\nthat leaded fuel was harmful to children.\n\nHere in Sri Lanka, the Environmental Foundation Ltd. is mounting a campaign\nto end the use of harmful leaded fuel.\n\nBut pollution is only one of the many pressing issues facing us. The\nsituation is certainly graver than it was when the first Earth Day was\ncelebrated in 1970 with a spontaneous uprising of people of all ages and\ncultures across the U.S. Last week, the U.S Embassy in Colombo marked Earth\nDay (April 22) with the message that \"every day should be an Earth Day\".\n\nEarth Day was the brainchild of dedicated environmentalist and conservationist\nSenator Nelson. His aim was to bring into the political limelight, what\nhe regarded as an inexorable slide towards an impending environmental crisis.\nHe called on the American people to demonstrate their concern about what\nwas happening to their air, land, and water and spur the government and\ncorporate America into action.\n\nThe response was astonishing. He had hit the nerve of a generation.\nHis idea was the spark that galvanized a highly politicized young America\nto put environmental responsibility on the political and corporate agenda.\n\nThe truly remarkable feature about that first Earth Day was not just\nthat 20 million demonstrators took to the streets: it was that the day\norganized itself.\n\nSo great was the concern over the lack of importance attached to the\nenvironment that a dynamo force - fuelled by a multitude of concerned citizens\n-took hold at the grassroots level and swept the nation with an unforeseen\nintensity.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Ashley Wills opened last week's Earth\nDay session at the American Information Resource Center. Although he modestly\ndescribed himself as \"not an expert, but merely a keen observer of environmental\nmatters\", he revealed that he had been a correspondent to a leading U.S.\nenvironmental magazine and was inspired by the phenomenon that was the\nEarth Day.\n\nConcerns about the environment have increasingly been brought into the\npublic arena over the past few decades. This is not only due to increasingly\nradical groups playing the media game or eco-warriors becoming more organized,\nbut because of a groundswell of opinion among \"ordinary\" people across\nthe world. This has produced a quiet \"green revolution\" that has brought\nenvironmental issues into the economic, political and humanitarian mainstream.\n\nSo what are the current global environmental concerns? What in practical\nterms are governments and multinational companies doing to ensure that\nall aspects of their businesses include an environmental dimension?\n\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was\nset out in 1992 in response to the problem of global warming due to an\nincrease of \" greenhouse gases\" from industry and vehicles.\n\nThe Convention sets out an ultimate objective of stabilizing greenhouse\ngas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous\nanthropogenic interference with the climate system. It directs that 'such\na level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems\nto adapt naturally to climatic change, to ensure that food production is\nnot threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable\nmanner'.\n\nThe Convention's primary success lay in overcoming the fundamental hurdle\n- that the nations of the world put aside their differences to co-operate\non a crisis of global proportions. By September 2000, it had over 186 countries\nas signatories - not just in acceding to the ethos of the convention, but\nin providing the instruments of ratification.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol - set out in 1997 by the world's industrialized nations\n- aims to assign a method, time-scale and monitoring procedures to the\nUNFCCC. Much has been made of the USA's current refusal to sign this protocol\nand subsequently bring it into force, but Ambassador Wills explains, \"It\nis not that President Bush has rejected the idea of curbing emissions,\nit is the terms of the protocol, that are problematic. The economic and\nhuman impact must be considered, as well as questions of equity and justice.\"\nGood place to start\n\nSo what can an individual in Sri Lanka do to protect the environment?\n\nInformation, awareness raising and education are the keys. The Environmental\nFoundation Ltd, an organization of scientists, lawyers, campaigners, mediators\nand educators is an excellent starting place; likewise \"Ruk Rakaganno\"\n- a group of activists who inform and campaign on all aspects of the environment\nand ecological protection.\n\nThe work of the Environmental Foundation ranges from challenging multinational\nbanks and companies on their environmental record, fighting actions on\nbehalf of the public on ecological issues, to spearheading campaigns to\nget the government's attention, and creating education programmes for wildlife\nand forestry personnel, as well as schools and the general public.\n\nThe work of \"Ruk Rakaganno\" is based on the philosophy that we need\nthe earth, and all its workings, and the earth needs us.

{"text":"NASA Gains New Insight on Chinese Air Pollution\n\nby Matt Ball on March 19, 2008\n\nNew measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite detail the pollution generated from East Asian forest fires, industrial production and transportation exhaust. The rapid industrial growth of China, coupled by urban expansion, has made the country the world's largest emitter of pollution that finds its way across the Pacific Ocean on the jetstream.\n\n\"We used the latest satellite capabilities to distinguish industrial pollution and smoke from dust transported to the western regions of North America from East Asia. Looking at four years of data from 2002 to 2005 we estimated the amount of pollution arriving in North America to be equivalent to about 15 percent of local emissions of the U.S. and Canada,\" Yu said. \"This is a significant percentage at a time when the U.S. is trying to decrease pollution emissions to boost overall air quality. This means that any reduction in our emissions may be offset by the pollution aerosols coming from East Asia and other regions.\"\n\nThe satellite instrument provides accurate daily measurements across a broad geographic region and a long time frame to greatly improve previous models and measurements. While this new instrument is a vast improvement, it doesn't measure the elevation of the pollutants in the atmosphere. Without the elevation measurement, it isn't possible to determine the impact on air quality.\n\n\"In the last two decades, China has more than doubled its pollution production. This boom may be contributing to substantial changes in climate and weather in places far from the origin of the particulates. Never in human history\u2014anywhere\u2014has there been industrial growth like that in modern China. But with fast growth comes unintended consequences, and from space evidence of those consequences is starting to emerge.\"\n\nResearchers found that pollution movements fluctuates during the year, with the greatest impact in Spring. And Asia isn't the only contributor, with European pollution also having an impact on North America. It can take as little as one week for pollutants to make their way across the pacific.\n\nYou can learn more about this research, and view an animation of pollution, on the NASA website.\n\nPlain and simple cure. Stop buying Chinese. Notice no pollution coming from the USA or Canada with our power plants, steel mills ( yes they still do operate)and auto plants. Force our business to bring back the jobs.

Credit: Photo by Bill Dube\/NOAA\n\nA thick blanket of yellow haze hovering over Houston as a result of chemical pollution produced by manufacturing petroleum products may be getting a little bit thinner, according to a new study.\n\nBut the new findings -- which have implications for petrochemical-producing cities around the world -- come with a catch, says a team of scientists from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, or CIRES, a joint institute of the University of Colorado at Boulder and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe problem is that industry still significantly underestimates the amounts of reactive chemicals being released into the air, according to airplane measurements made by the research team as part of the study. Inaccuracies in the reporting of emissions pose big challenges for the reduction and regulation of emissions coming from petrochemical plants. The emissions are important to monitor, because some chemicals released from the plants react to form ground-level ozone that can be harmful to human health and agricultural crops.\n\n\"Emissions may have decreased some, but there's still a long way to go,\" said study author Joost de Gouw, a CIRES atmospheric scientist. \"And the emission inventories by industry were not any better in 2006 than they were in 2000.\"\n\nStates that regularly suffer from ozone problems like Texas are required by the federal government to scientifically model what happens during air pollution episodes and develop plans for mitigation. For that to happen effectively, modelers need good inventories, says the research team.\n\n\"Initial inventories are not based on measurements. They're based on estimates,\" said de Gouw. \"When you go back to verify those estimates, we find they're not very accurate.\"\n\nTo check on those estimates, lead study author Rebecca Washenfelder of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory and CIRES, along with de Gouw, took to the plumes in an aircraft, the NOAA WP-3D, outfitted with an array of air quality measuring instruments. The plane flew through emissions over Houston as part of the second Texas Air Quality Study in 2006, sampling air for signs of ingredients of the chemical reaction that makes ozone, including nitrogen oxides and reactive hydrocarbons.\n\nWashenfelder, de Gouw and their study colleagues compared these measurements with data taken during similar flyovers from the first Texas Air Quality Study in 2000 and another flight in 2002. They then compared those measurements against emissions inventories for each year. In all cases, the industry-reported inventories -- which are supplied to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -- didn't agree with the measured amounts of pollutants.\n\nThe conflicting data is likely a problem of estimation and general industry practice. \"There are tens of thousands of valves and fittings installed throughout the plants in most cases with an assumed -- not measured -- leak rate for each,\" Washenfelder said.\n\nBut industry is taking steps to lessen ozone-causing emissions, and repairs to petrochemical plants may have contributed to recent emission declines. Washenfelder and de Gouw found that the concentrations of ethene and propene -- which both contribute to ozone formation -- dropped by 52 percent and 48 percent respectively between 2000 and 2006.\n\nThe two scientists see the study as a wake-up call for emissions monitoring.\n\n\"There are a lot of discussions with the petrochemical industry on how to measure these things instead of relying on estimates,\" said de Gouw. \"I think the No. 1 issue here is awareness. As soon as industry is aware that there could be emissions problems down the road, they can figure out how to fix them at lower cost.\"A new study involving the University of Colorado at Boulder shows that invisible, reactive gases hovering over Earth's surface, not direct emissions of particulates, form the bulk of organic haze in both urban ...\n\nSpringtime ozone levels above western North America are rising primarily due to air flowing eastward from the Pacific Ocean, a trend that is largest when the air originates in Asia.

The research from Tel Aviv University concludes that air pollution impacts cardiac events such as heart attack and stroke, as well as repeat episodes over the long term.\n\nAccording to Dr. Yariv Gerber of TAU's School of Public Health at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Cardiac patients living in high pollution areas were found to be over 40 percent more likely to have a second heart attack when compared to patients living in low pollution areas.\n\nDr Yariv Gerber said:\n\nThe study quantified the association between cardiac risk and air pollution and determine the long-term effects on myocardial infarction (MI) patients.\n\nThe study followed 1,120 first-time MI patients who had been admitted to one of eight hospitals in central Israel between 1992 and 1993, all of whom at the time were under the age of 65. The patients were followed up until 2011, a period of 19 years.\n\nAir quality was measured and analyzed at 21 monitoring stations in areas where the patients lived. Whilst taking into account other contributing factors such as socio-economic status and disease severity, the researchers identified an association between pollution and negative clinical outcomes, including mortality and recurrent vascular events such as heart attack, stroke and heart failure.\n\nThe study found that patients who lived in the most polluted environments were 43 percent more likely to have a second heart attack or suffer congestive heart failure and 46 percent more likely to suffer a stroke than those who lived in areas with lower levels of pollution.\n\nAccording to Dr. Gerber, the true impact of air pollution might be even stronger than this study shows. \"Our method of assessing exposure does have limitations. Because we are using data from monitoring stations, it's a crude estimate of exposure, which most likely leads to an underestimation of the association,\" he warns. He estimates that air pollution could have double the negative impact with more precise measurement.\n\nThe research suggests not only the need to limit air pollution by industrial emissions and second hand smoke, but also calls for heightened awareness. Doctors should be making their patients aware of the risks of remaining in high pollution areas, suggesting that they work to limit their exposure.\n\nThe above post was repurposed from information provided by Tel Aviv University, sourced from Eureka Alert\n\nSlow aging is about prevention (of disease) and proactive health behaviors.

{"text":"Air Pollution\n\nSignificant progress has been made in recent years cleaning up outdoor air pollution in the U.S. Between 1970 and 2004, total emissions of the six major air pollutants regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) dropped by 54 percent. This is particularly impressive when noted that the gross domestic product increased 187 percent, energy consumption increased 47 percent, and U.S. population grew by 40 percent during the same time, proof that economic growth and environmental protection do go hand in hand. However, air pollution remains a serious threat to public health and the environment. Outdoor air pollution in the U.S. due to particulate pollution alone was estimated by the EPA in 1997 to cause at least 20,000 premature deaths each year. Other estimates place this number at 50,000 to 100,000 deaths per year. Globally, about 800,000 people per year die prematurely due to outdoor air pollution, according to a 2005 study (PDF File) published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health. This represents about 1.2 percent of total annual global deaths.\n\nFigure 1. Deaths from urban air pollution in 2000, as estimated by the World Health Organization World Health Report, 2002.\n\nWhile levels of many pollutants have been decreasing in recent years, progress cleaning up one serious pollutant, ground-level ozone, has been difficult. The American Lung Association estimates that over half of the nation's population lives in counties receiving a grade of \"F\" on their rating system for ozone pollution. The death toll due to air pollution only begins to touch the vast magnitude of human suffering caused by breathing our dirty air--for every 75 deaths per year due to air pollution in the U.S., health scientists have estimated that there are 505 hospital admissions for asthma and other respiratory diseases, 3,500 respiratory emergency doctor visits, 180,000 asthma attacks, 930,000 restricted activity days, and 2,000,000 acute respiratory symptom days.\n\nThe Clean Air Act requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six pollutants, called \"criteria pollutants\", considered harmful to public health and the environment. The EPA maintains a database of air pollution forecasts generated for over 150 locations for these six pollutants by the local or state agencies responsible. These forecasts are sent to The Weather Underground as they are updated, and we post the forecasts for the affected areas. Many smaller cities and rural areas do not have air pollution forecasts available. A comprehensive web page indexing all the available air pollution forecasts and real-time air pollution observations is available at the EPA's AIRNOW site.\n\nThe National Ambient Air Quality Standards for the six criteria pollutants are listed below.

They have been smoldering for years and I expect they will smolder for a few more years.\n\nAs background, more than a year ago I wrote a piece entitled Form of Argument: Adventures in Rhetoric. In that blog I named a number ...\n\nThe top climate story of 2008, as it was in 2007, was the extraordinary summertime sea ice retreat in the Arctic. For the second consecutive year, we experienced the opening of the fabled Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic waters. Explorers have been attempting to sail the Northwest Passage since 1497, and 2007 and 2008 are the only known years the passage has been ice-free. In addition, 2008 saw the simultaneous opening of the Northeast Passage along the coast of Russia. This meant that for the first time in recorded history, the Arctic ice cap was an island--one could completely circumnavigate the Arctic Ocean in ice-free waters."}
{"text":"Air pollution has many effects on the health of both adults and children. The\npurpose of this article will be to examine what is known about how air pollution\naffects health, especially children's.\n\nOver the past several years the incidence of a number of diseases has\nincreased greatly. Asthma is perhaps the most important disease with an\nincreasing incidence, but other diseases, such as allergic reactions, bronchitis\nand respiratory infections also have been increasing. The cause of these\nincreases may be due at least in part to the effects of air pollution. This\nreview will address the following questions:\n\nWhy are children more susceptible to the effects of air pollution than\nadults?\n\nWhich air pollutants have the greatest impact on the health of children\nand adults?\n\nWhat can be done to reduce the effects of air pollution on children's\nhealth?\n\nIn many health effects research studies, children are considered as if they\nwere small adults. This is not really true. There are many differences between\nchildren and adults in the ways that they respond to air pollution. For example,\nchildren take in more air per unit body weight at a given level of exertion than\ndo adults. When a child is exercising at maximum levels, such as during a soccer\ngame or other sports event, they may take in 20 percent to 50 percent more air\n-- and more air pollution -- than would an adult in comparable activity.\n\nAnother important difference is that children do not necessarily respond to\nair pollution in the same way as adults. Adults exposed to low levels of the\npollutant ozone will experience symptoms such as coughing, soreness in their\nchests, sore throats, and sometimes headaches. Children, on the other hand, may\nnot feel the same symptoms, or at least they do not acknowledge them when asked\nby researchers. It is currently not known if children actually do not feel the\nsymptoms or if they ignore them while preoccupied with play activities.\n\nThis probably does not mean that children are less sensitive to air pollution\nthan adults. There are several good studies that show children to have losses in\nlung functions even when they don't cough or feel discomfort. This is important\nbecause symptoms are often warning signals and can be used to trigger protective\nbehavior. Children may not perceive these warning signals and might not reduce\ntheir activities on smoggy days.\n\nChildren also spend more time outside than adults. The average adult, except\nfor those who work mostly outdoors, spends most of their time indoors -- at\nhome, work, or even at the gym. Children spend more time outside, and are often\noutdoors during periods when air pollution is at its highest.\n\nThe typical adult spends 85 percent to 95 percent of their time indoors,\nwhile children may spend less than 80 percent of their time indoors. Children\nmay also exert themselves harder than adults when playing outside.\n\nPerhaps the most important difference between adults and children is that\nchildren are growing and developing. Along with their increased body size,\nchildren's lungs are growing and changing, too.\n\nThe Lung's Important Role in Health\nThe lung is an extremely complex organ. While most organs in your body are made\nup of a few different types of cells, the lung contains more than 40 different\nkinds of cells. Each of these cells is important to health and maintaining the\nbody's fitness.\n\nAir pollution can change the cells in the lung by damaging those that are\nmost susceptible. If the cells that are damaged are important in the development\nof new functional parts of the lung, then the lung may not achieve its full\ngrowth and function as a child matures to adulthood. Although very little\nresearch has been conducted to address this extremely important issue, this\nreview will discuss the information that is available.\n\nUSC Children's Health Study\nRecent results from the Children's Health Study, conducted by investigators at\nthe University of Southern California, suggest that children with asthma are at\nmuch greater risk of increased asthma symptoms when they live in communities\nwith higher levels of ozone and particles and participate in three or more\ncompetitive sports. Having said all this, the purpose of this review is not to\ndiscourage children or adults from normal daily activities and outdoor exercise.\nExercise has very important, beneficial outcomes. Appropriate exercise and\nprudent exposures of children and adults should be encouraged even in an\nenvironment that may always contain some amount of air pollution.\n\nOzone is one of the most important air pollutants affecting human health in\nregions like Southern California.\n\nOzone (O3) is a molecule built of three atoms of oxygen linked together in a\nvery energetic combination. When ozone comes into contact with a surface it\nrapidly releases this extra force in the form of chemical energy. When this\nhappens in biological systems, such as the respiratory tract, this energy can\ncause damage to sensitive tissues in the upper and lower airways.\n\nOzone formation\nBecause ozone forms as a product of solar energy and photochemical\nreactions of pollutants, it is not surprising that the highest concentrations of\nozone in the atmosphere occur when sunlight is most intense. Thus, ozone\ngenerally reaches peak levels during the middle of the day in the summer months.\nThese types of air pollution patterns are called diurnal and seasonal\nvariations. The following graph shows that ozone levels in the San Bernardino\nMountains are highest in the summer and fall, and peak in the late afternoon.\n\nOzone Air Quality Standards\nFederal and state agencies have set air quality\nstandards for ozone. An ozone level greater than 0.08 parts per million (ppm)\naveraged over eight hours is considered unhealthful. This level has been set\nbecause both laboratory and community studies have demonstrated measurable\neffects of ozone at or above that threshold.\n\nThe effects of ozone on people include:\n\nirritation of the nose and throat;\n\nincreased mucus production and tendency to cough;\n\neye irritation and headaches for some; and\n\nduring severe episodes, chest pain and difficulty taking a deep breath\nwithout coughing.\n\nHow Ozone Damages Lungs\nWhat happens when you breathe air that is\ncontaminated with ozone? Like oxygen, ozone is soluble in the fluids that line\nthe respiratory tract. Therefore some ozone can penetrate into the gas-exchange,\nor alveolar, region of the deep lung.\n\nThe following photos show how ozone affects the sensitive tissue in the deep\nlung. The pictures are from the lungs of rats exposed to ozone in a laboratory\nunder carefully controlled conditions. The human lung is similar --although not\nidentical -- to the rat's lung in terms of the types of cells and the overall\nstructure of the alveolar region.\n\nFigure 1 shows a magnified view of the structure\nof the normal gas-exchange region of the lung. It is called the gas-exchange\nregion because oxygen inhaled from the air is transferred to the hemoglobin\nin blood in small blood vessels located inside the thin walls separating the\nalveolar air spaces very large surface area across\nwhich gases can be efficiently transported very large surface area across\nwhich gases can be efficiently transported.\n\nFigure 2 shows the effects of breathing 0.2 ppm ozone for 4 hours. In\nSouthern California air pollution levels can approach 0.2 ppm -- a Stage 1 ozone\nalert -- during the smoggiest summer days. The photo shows evidence of\nadditional cells, called macrophages, and some material that may be fragments of\nozone-injured alveolar wall cells inside the alveolar space.\n\nMacrophages are immune system cells that respond to the injury of the\ndelicate cells that line the alveolar lumen. These macrophages play important\nroles in protecting the lungs from inhaled bacteria, fungi and viruses, and are\nalso important in helping to repair lung tissue injury caused by inhaled\npollutants.\n\nFigure 3 shows more extensive damage following exposure a higher\nconcentration of ozone, 0.6 ppm. The alveolar walls are thicker and there is\nevidence of cells infiltrating within the walls. There are more macrophages in\nthe alveolar spaces and the thin, Type I cells have been damaged and replaced\nwith thicker Type II, almost cube-shaped cells that are more resistant to the\ntoxic effects of ozone. All of these changes occurred within 48 hours after\nexposure. If exposure continues for more than three days, the evidence of cell\ninjury seems to be reduced, except for the continuing presence of the Type II\ncells.\n\nIs Ozone-Related Lung Damage Permanent?\nPeople actually report that the symptoms they feel when first exposed to ozone\nseem to go away, even though their exposure continues.\n\nFollowing ozone injury, if the lung is not exposed to ozone for approximately\nfive to seven days, it can for the most part repair itself provided the injury\nis not too extensive. However, long-term studies with laboratory animals have\nshown that there may be residual and in some cases permanent damage. This damage\nmight be thought of as accelerated aging of the lung. Thus, frequent exposures\nto ozone can cause transient damage. The lung's defenses can repair most but\nprobably not all of that damage within a relatively short time in most healthy\nindividuals.\n\nResearch and Air Quality Standards\nHealth scientists probably know more about the effects of ozone on human health\nthan about any other pollutants. This is because ozone is pervasive in the\nenvironment. Also there are excellent methods of measuring ozone so the\npollutant can be studied using epidemiological methods. The findings of these\nepidemiological studies can be verified using well-controlled laboratory studies\nwith human volunteers and laboratory animals. Thousands of scientific papers on\nthe health effects of ozone have been published and these have been critically\nreviewed in documents that provide the scientific basis for National and State\nAmbient Air Quality Standards. (Ambient refers to outdoor air.)\n\nThese so-called Criteria Documents are important because they are extensively\nreviewed by scientists, public agencies, industry representatives, environmental\ngroups such as the American Lung Association and the Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, and the public. National and state ambient air quality standards set\nthe goals for healthy air quality in Southern California and across the country.\n\nBased upon the most recent studies, it is now apparent that ozone plays an\nimportant role in causing acute health effects, such as heightening asthma\nsymptoms and developing bronchitis symptoms.\n\nThe role of ozone in producing long-term or chronic effects is less clear, at\nleast from the available epidemiological studies. However, laboratory animal\nstudies suggest that there can be long-term consequences.\n\nHow to Reduce Ozone Exposure\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recommended that ozone should\nnot exceed 0.08 ppm averaged over an 8-hr period. When ozone exceeds this level,\nactive children and adults, those with respiratory disease such as asthma, and\nother people with unusual susceptibility to ozone should limit prolonged outdoor\nexposure.\n\nIncidentally, personal tobacco smoking during periods of high ozone exposure\ndoubled the risk of asthmatic individuals needing to go to the emergency room\nfor treatment of asthma symptoms.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO), a colorless, odorless gas, is a byproduct of\ncombustion.\n\nWhen inhaled, carbon monoxide reacts very rapidly with hemoglobin in the\nblood, preventing uptake and transport of oxygen. Because carbon monoxide\nreadily and firmly attaches to hemoglobin, it stays in the blood for a\nrelatively long time. Thus, during an exposure carbon monoxide concentrations in\nblood can rise in a matter of minutes, then stay high for hours.\n\nWho is Most Sensitive to the Health Effects of Carbon Monoxide?\nMost of the health effects directly associated with carbon monoxide are most\nlikely due to decreases in oxygen delivery to vital organs such as the heart and\nthe brain.\n\nPeople with heart disease may be especially sensitive to the effects of\ncarbon monoxide. In addition, people with lung diseases that limit efficient use\nof inhaled oxygen, such as asthma and emphysema, may also be susceptible. Even\nin people without heart or lung diseases, reduced delivery of oxygen to skeletal\nmuscles, especially during exercise, can reduce the ability to perform strenuous\nwork.\n\nAt high levels of carbon monoxide exposure, impaired delivery of oxygen to\nthe central nervous system can reduce the ability to respond quickly to external\nstimuli. After exposures that convert 5 percent to 10 percent of the circulating\nhemoglobin to carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), people's ability to recognize and react\nto flashes of light in a test system are reduced. At 10 percent to 30 percent\ncarboxyhemoglobin, nausea, headaches, unconsciousness, and sometimes death can\nresult. The severity of symptoms increases with the concentration of\ncarboxyhemoglobin.\n\nAir Quality Standards for Carbon Monoxide\nBoth the EPA and the State of California have set air quality standards for\ncarbon monoxide based on the results of epidemiological and laboratory findings.\nAmbient levels of carbon monoxide should not exceed 9 ppm, when averaged over an\n8-hour interval, and should not exceed 20 ppm in any one-hour period. (The USEPA\nhas a slightly higher 1-hour standard of 35 ppm).\n\nSources of Carbon Monoxide\nThe major sources of carbon monoxide pollution are automotive exhaust and\nemissions from large industrial combustion sources such as electrical power\nplants. Because these sources produce many contaminants in addition to carbon\nmonoxide -- such as fine particles and nitrogen oxides -- it is often difficult\nto isolate the health effects of ambient carbon monoxide from those of other\npollutants.\n\nIn addition to carbon monoxide generated outside, there are also important\nindoor sources of the pollutant. The most important of these are combustion\nsources such as gas ovens, gas burners, water heaters, and heating systems.\nHowever, in most cases emissions from well-maintained and vented gas appliances\nare small.\n\nTobacco smoking is a more significant source of carbon monoxide. Tobacco\nsmoke can contain very high concentrations of carbon monoxide (1,000 ppm to\n50,000 ppm). Carbon monoxide levels in the homes of children whose relatives\nsmoke tobacco products can be higher than the carbon monoxide levels outdoors.\n\nHealth Effects of Carbon Monoxide\nThere are hundreds of cases per year of deaths or severe illness due to carbon\nmonoxide poisoning from faulty appliances, indoor emissions of automobile\nexhaust and industrial exposures. These cases show that carbon monoxide\npoisoning causes symptoms very similar to those of the flu. In fact, the true\nnumber of cases is not really known because many people may have been poisoned\nslightly and thought that they were just fighting off a cold or the flu. Thus it\nis very important to make sure that home appliances are well-maintained and that\nall combustion sources are properly vented to the outdoors.\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown significant association between several\nhealth effects and carbon monoxide, although as mentioned earlier it is\ndifficult to completely isolate carbon monoxide's effects from those of other\nair pollutants.\n\nFor example, asthmatic children in Taiwan who were exposed to high levels of\ntraffic-related air pollution -- using carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide as\nmarker compounds-- reported more respiratory symptoms than children with lower\nexposures.\n\nA study of physician office visits in London showed associations between air\npollution and doctor visits for asthma and other lower respiratory disease. For\nchildren, levels of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide were\nassociated with increased numbers of medical consultations. However, in adults,\nthe only consistent association was with levels of airborne particles. This\nsuggests that children and adults might respond differently to pollution\nexposures.\n\nPrenatal Effects of Carbon Monoxide\nCarbon monoxide may also have prenatal effects. Pregnant women who were exposed\nto high levels of ambient carbon monoxide (5 ppm to 6 ppm) were at increased\nrisk of having low birth-weight babies. It has long been known that women who\nsmoke cigarettes during pregnancy have low birth-weight babies, but this is the\nfirst study of similar findings in women exposed to environmental carbon\nmonoxide.\n\nBabies exposed to carbon monoxide during the maturation of their organs may\nsuffer permanent changes to those organs. Studies using newborn rats showed that\ncarbon monoxide exposure could cause changes in the heart muscle tissue. This is\nturn could increase the severity of effects of artery constrictions when they\nbecame adults. Other animal studies have shown that long-term carbon monoxide\nexposure can contribute to a disease called ventricular hypertrophy, in which\nthe cells of the heart's ventricle chambers are enlarged and possibly weakened.\n\nParticles, including nitrates, sulfates, carbon1\nand acid aerosols2 are a complex group of\npollutants.\n\nUnlike ozone, which has a specific chemical composition, airborne particles\nvary in size and composition depending on time and location. Although the\ncomponents of particles may have common sources, the types and amounts of\nparticles collected at any one time and location may be unique.\n\nTo add to the problem, gaseous pollutants including ozone, sulfur dioxide,\nnitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide often are present in the atmosphere at the\nsame time as are particles. It is not always possible to clearly differentiate\nbetween the health effects of the gases, the particles, and possibly the\ncombination of particles and gases. This complexity presents a tremendous\nchallenge to the scientific community and to public in trying to understand how\ninhaled particles affect human health.\n\nThe Challenge of Measuring Particle Pollution\nPrecisely measuring particulate pollution is more difficult and labor intensive\nthan measuring gaseous pollutants such as ozone. For this reason, particle\nconcentrations are not measured on a daily basis in most communities.\nFrequently, they are measured once every six days.\n\nParticle samples are collected on filters that are then weighed. Particle\nconcentrations are reported in terms of micrograms of particles per cubic meter\n(\u00b5g\/m3) of collected air.\n\nOriginally, the particle samples were relatively indiscriminate with respect\nto particle size and often contained very large particles. These large particles\ncontributed a great deal to the weighed particle mass, but might not have been\nvery important with respect to lung health. This is because most of the\nparticles were too large to penetrate through the nasal and head airways to\nreach the lung. A more health-related sample was needed.\n\nAfter a great deal of scientific consideration it was decided that\nparticulate matter with aerodynamic diameters3\nless than or equal to 10 microns (\u00b5m) should be collected. Ambient air quality\nstandards were developed for this material, which is called PM10.\n\nSources of Particle Pollution\nResearchers noted that the sources of relatively large-size particles (greater\nthan 3 microns in aerodynamic diameter) were quite distinct from the sources of\nparticles less than 1 micron in diameter.\n\nThe larger, so-called \"coarse\" particles are mostly produced by mechanical\nprocesses, such as automobile tire wear on the road, industrial cutting,\ngrinding and pulverizing processes and re-suspension of particles from the\nground or other surfaces by wind and human activities. The chemical composition\nof coarse particles may be somewhat similar to the chemical composition of soil\nin that area, along with industrial compounds from activities such as mining or\nsmelting operations. The coarse fraction of urban aerosols also contains bits of\nplants, molds, spores and some bacteria. Thus the characteristics of the coarse\nparticles may vary greatly in different communities.\n\nIn contrast, the smaller or so-called \"fine\" particles in the urban aerosol\ncome from combustion sources, such as power plants, automobile, truck, bus and\nother vehicle exhaust or from the reactions that transform some of the pollutant\ngases into solid or liquid particles. These distinctions may be important\nbecause the current air pollution health effects literature suggests, although\nnot with certainty, that for some key health effects the fine particles are more\nimportant than the coarse particles. These findings have led EPA to propose a\nnew nationwide PM2.5 standard that would reduce exposure to particles that are\n2.5 microns or less in diameter.\n\nHistoric Air Pollution Disasters\nEpidemiological studies have consistently associated adverse health effects with\nexposures to particulate air pollution. Early studies implicated particulate and\nsulfur dioxide pollution in the acute illnesses and premature deaths associated\nwith extremely severe pollution episodes in Donora, Penn., London, and New York\nin the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The particle levels in a four-week pollution\ndisaster in London in 1955 were more than 50 times higher than the California\nstandard. Twenty percent of that aerosol was composed of acid sulfates --\nprobably sulfuric acid. The number of people hospitalized for lung or\nheart-related diseases was extraordinarily high, but more importantly there were\nmore than 4,000 premature, or \"excess,\" deaths in the London population.\n\nFortunately, major efforts by government agencies, the public, and industries\nhave made it very unlikely there will ever be a similar episode in modern urban\ncommunities. However, the lessons learned from these disasters are still\nrelevant. Despite the fact that our levels of airborne particles are much lower\nthan those that occurred during the disasters, EPA estimates that there are\nstill more than 6,000 excess deaths in the United States that could be\nassociated with inhaled particles.\n\nHealth Effects of Particulate Pollution\nCurrent ambient levels of PM10 -- 30 to 150 micrograms per cubic meter -- are\nassociated with increases in the numbers of people that die daily from heart or\nlung failure. Most of these deaths are among the elderly. However there is a\nstrong body of evidence that some children are also adversely affected by\nparticulate matter.\n\nThe American Thoracic Society's Environmental and Occupational Health\nAssembly reviewed current health effects literature. They report that daily\nfluctuations in PM10 levels have been related to: \u2022 acute respiratory hospital\nadmissions in children; \u2022 school and kindergarten absences; \u2022 decreases in peak\nlung air flow rates in normal children; and \u2022 increased medication use in\nchildren and adults with asthma.\n\nThe USC Children's Health Study suggests that children with asthma living in\na community with high particle concentrations may have suppressed lung growth.\nAfter children moved into cleaner cities their lung growth returned to the\nnormal rate, but they did not recover the lost potential growth, according to\nJohn Peters, the study's principle investigator.\n\nIt is difficult to positively assign a quantitative risk associated with\nparticulate matter because nearly all studies of its health effects find other\npollutants present that may account for some of the effects.\n\nPart of the problem is due to the nature of the data being collected. The\nlevels of particulate matter vary during the course of the day and peak values\ncan be quite high. Few studies have evaluated the effect of these short-term\n\"spikes.\" However, at least one epidemiological study of children with asthma\nsuggested that changes in symptoms and lung function correlate more strongly\nwith 1-hour peaks than with 24-hour average concentrations.\n\nOther studies, primarily with laboratory animals, suggest that the chemical\ncomposition and surface areas of the particles may be more important than\nparticle mass. Scientists are continuing to study the health effects of\nparticles and are developing better methods for measuring the important\nconstituents. It may be possible in the near future to more accurately assess\nthe effects of inhaled particles on human health.\n\nNitrogen oxides are produced during most combustion processes. Mobile sources\nand power plants are the major contributors in Southern California.\n\nAbout 80 percent of the immediately released nitrogen oxide is in the form\nnitric oxide (NO). Small amounts of nitrous oxide (N2O) are also produced.\nNitrous oxide is a \"greenhouse\" gas that is suspected of playing an important\nrole in global warming.\n\nNitric oxide reacts with oxygen in the air to produce nitrogen dioxide (NO2).\nFurther oxidation during the day causes the nitrogen dioxide to form nitric acid\nand nitrate particles. In the dark, nitrogen dioxide can react with ozone and\nform a very reactive free radical. The free radical then can react with organic\ncompounds in the air to form nitrogenated organic compounds, some of which have\nbeen shown to be mutagenic and carcinogenic.\n\nHealth Effects of Nitrogen Dioxide\nNitrogen dioxide is the most important nitrogen oxide compound with respect to\nacute adverse health effects. Under most chemical conditions it is an oxidant,\nas is ozone. However, it takes about 10 times more nitrogen dioxide than ozone\nto cause significant lung irritation and inflammation.\n\nNitrogen dioxide differs from ozone in that it suppresses the immune system\nto a much greater degree. As discussed below, some epidemiological studies have\nshown that children exposed to high levels of ambient nitrogen dioxide may be at\nincreased risk of respiratory infections. Studies with laboratory animals have\nindeed shown that if mice are exposed first to nitrogen dioxide and later to\nbacteria at a level that would not infect a healthy control animal, their normal\nlung defense mechanisms are suppressed and the bacteria are able to infect the\nhost.\n\nAverage levels of nitrogen dioxide in the United States range from 0.02 to\n0.04 ppm. Levels in major urban areas in Southern California may be higher, but\nthe region has not exceeded the federal standard4\nfor nitrogen dioxide since 1991.\n\nDuring the 1970s, one of the first studies relating respiratory illnesses and\nchanges in lung function to ambient nitrogen dioxide concentrations reported\nthat children living in areas with high nitrogen dioxide concentrations had\ngreater incidences of lung-related illness than children living in areas with\nlower concentrations. Since then, other epidemiological studies have suggested\nthat children with asthma are more likely than children without asthma to have\nreduced lung function and symptoms of respiratory irritation, such as cough and\nsore throat, when outdoor average nitrogen dioxide concentrations exceed about\n0.02 ppm.\n\nSome studies also have suggested that children younger than five years old\nmay be more severely affected by nitrogen dioxide than older children. Several\nepidemiological studies have suggested that for children, the most important\neffect of ambient exposure to nitrogen dioxide might be increased susceptibility\nto respiratory infections and increased severity of responses to inhaled\nallergens.\n\nAlthough many epidemiological studies show significant associations between\noutdoor nitrogen dioxide concentrations and adverse health outcomes, some\nstudies do not corroborate these effects. In part, this is because it is often\ndifficult to fully account for the influences of indoor sources of nitrogen\ndioxide.\n\nImprovements in Nitrogen Dioxide Measurements\nMore recent studies have used special devices, called passive dosimeters, that\ncan be worn by children to collect nitrogen dioxide for later analysis. These\nmeasurements give epidemiologists the ability to better assess a child's total\nnitrogen dioxide exposure over the course of the day. These studies show that\nthere can be a great deal of individual variation in exposures, even for\nchildren living in the same communities. Thus, it is not surprising that\nepidemiological studies that do not estimate a nitrogen dioxide dose may reach\ndifferent conclusions.\n\nHowever, laboratory studies involving controlled exposures of human\nvolunteers and laboratory animals have demonstrated plausible effects of\nnitrogen dioxide on human health. For example, if one exposes rats or other\nanimals to nitrogen dioxide, and then examines their respiratory tract tissues,\nit is very evident that the pollutant can cause short-term injury similar to\nthat seen after ozone exposure.\n\nLong-term exposures to high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide can produce\nchronic damage to respiratory tract tissue that resembles the lung disease\nemphysema.\n\nThe pollutant's suppression of immune system functions reduces the ability of\nthe host to fight off bacterial and viral infections. Human volunteers who\ninhaled weakened influenza virus after being exposed to nitrogen dioxide in\nlaboratories were more susceptible to the infection than a control group that\ndid not inhale nitrogen dioxide.\n\nOther studies show that nitrogen dioxide decreases the body's ability to\ngenerate antibodies when challenged by pathogens, and may reduce the ability of\nthe respiratory system to remove foreign particles such as bacteria and viruses\nfrom the lung.\n\nPeople can be exposed to lead (Pb) through air, food and water. Lead is a\ntoxic heavy metal that causes nerve damage and impairs the body's ability to\nmake hemoglobin, leading to a form of anemia.\n\nSources of Lead Pollution\nLarge amounts of lead were emitted to the atmosphere when it was used as a\ngasoline additive.5 The emitted lead could be inhaled. In addition, lead fallout\nfrom the air caused widespread contamination of soil, plants, food products, and\nwater.\n\nLead is often measured in children's blood as an index of environmental\nexposure. Even low levels of lead6 in the blood of children aged 6 to 7 are\nlinked to measurable changes in intelligence quotient and certain\nperceptual-motor skills. Higher levels of lead exposure can also result in\nkidney damage and may be related to high blood pressure in adults.\n\nMost manmade emissions of the gas sulfur dioxide (SO2) come primarily from\nthe combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and diesel fuel.\n\nMost of the sulfur in fossil fuel is converted sulfur dioxide, but a small\namount is also converted to sulfuric acid. In the atmosphere, gaseous sulfur\ndioxide can also be converted to sulfuric acid and sulfate-containing particles.\nThus, atmospheric concentrations of sulfur dioxide are often highly associated\nwith acidic particles, sulfuric acid particles and sulfate particle\nconcentrations.\n\nThe current National Ambient Air Quality Standards for sulfur dioxide are 18\nmicrograms per cubic meter averaged annually, and 365 micrograms per cubic meter\naveraged over 24 hours. Southern California does not exceed the national air\nquality standard because its industries primarily burn low-sulfur fuels such as\nnatural gas. Much of the sulfur oxide air pollution in Southern California is\nlikely to be associated with diesel emissions.\n\nSulfur dioxide is a very water-soluble gas and therefore most of the sulfur\ndioxide that is inhaled is absorbed in the upper respiratory tract and does not\nreach the lung's airways. However, the small amount of sulfur dioxide that does\npenetrate into the airways can provoke important health effects, primarily in\nindividuals with asthma.\n\nFor those with asthma, even relatively short-term, low-level exposures to\nsulfur dioxide can result in airway constriction leading to difficulty in\nbreathing and possibly contribute to the severity of an asthmatic attack.\n\nA number of epidemiological studies have shown associations between ambient\nsulfur dioxide and rates of mortality (death) and morbidity (illness). However,\nbecause sulfur dioxide is often strongly correlated with fine particles and\nespecially sulfate-containing particles, it is difficult to separate the effects\nof sulfur dioxide from those of the particle compounds.\n\nA study in France found an increase of 2.9 visits to the emergency room for\nevery 20 micrograms per cubic meter increase in atmospheric sulfur dioxide. The\nresults pertained to days when the average sulfur dioxide levels were above 68\nmicrograms per cubic meter but below the U.S. health standard.\n\nIn London, asthma and other lower respiratory diseases in children were most\nsignificantly associated with exposures to nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide,\nand sulfur dioxide. In adults the only consistent association was with\nparticulate matter.\n\nHospital admissions for children with asthma may increase by 20 percent\nfollowing acute exposure to ozone peaks and possibly with sulfur dioxide.\nChronic exposure to increased levels of fine particles, sulfur dioxide, and\nnitrogen dioxide may be associated with up to threefold increase in nonspecific\nrespiratory symptoms. Thus, recent literature suggests that sulfur dioxide\naffects adults and children differently and that chronic and acute effects may\nalso be different.\n\nDiesel fuel is burned to power buses, trucks, road-building equipment,\ntrains, boats and ships and electricity-generating equipment. When diesel fuel\nis burned, the exhaust includes both particles and gases. Diesel emissions are\nimportant constituents of ambient air pollution.\n\nWhat's in Diesel?\nDiesel particles consist mainly of elemental carbon and other carbon-containing\ncompounds. Hundreds of compounds have been identified as constituents of diesel\nparticles. These include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other\ncompounds that have been associated with tumor formation and cancer. In 1998,\nthe California Air Resources Board designated diesel particulate a\ncancer-causing toxic air contaminant.\n\nDiesel particles are microscopic. More than 90 percent of them are less than\n1 micron in diameter. Due to their minute size, diesel particles can penetrate\ndeeply into the lung. There is evidence that once in the lung, diesel particles\nmay stay there for a long time.\n\nIn addition to particles, diesel exhaust contains several gaseous compounds\nincluding carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and organic vapors,\nfor example formaldehyde and 1,3-butadiene. Formaldehyde and 1,3-butadiene have\nbeen classified as toxic and hazardous air pollutants. Both have been shown to\ncause tumors in animal studies and there is evidence that exposure to high\nlevels of 1,3-butadiene can cause cancer in humans.\n\nAQMD's recent landmark research project, the Multiple Air Toxics Exposure\nStudy II, found that diesel particulate is responsible for about 70 percent of\nthe total cancer risk from all toxic air pollution in the greater Los Angeles\nmetropolitan area.\n\nDiesel emissions may also be a problem for asthmatics. Some studies suggest\nthat children with asthma who live near roadways with high amounts of diesel\ntruck traffic have more asthma attacks and use more asthma medication.\n\nSome human volunteers, exposed to diesel exhaust in carefully controlled\nlaboratory studies, reported symptoms such as eye and throat irritation,\ncoughing, phlegm production, difficulty breathing, headache, lightheadedness,\nnausea and perception of unpleasant odors. Another laboratory study, in which\nvolunteers were exposed to relatively high levels of diesel particles for about\nan hour, showed that such exposures could cause lung inflammation.\n\nThus current epidemiological and laboratory evidence suggests that at typical\nurban concentrations, diesel exhaust may contribute significantly to the health\neffects of air pollution.\n\nAfter reviewing the literature on how children's exposures differ from those\nof adults, it is evident that:\n\nchildren are outdoors more hours per day than most adults;\n\nthey exert themselves to a greater degree while they are outside than most\nadults; and\n\nthey participate in more organized activities than adults.\n\nThere are definite health benefits to having children participate in outdoor\nactivities. However, scientific evidence also suggests that air pollution\nexposures can injure children's lungs and other organs.\n\nAir quality information in the form of health reports and air quality\nadvisories are now a regular part of life in California. One logical step is to\nreduce strenuous activities during pollution episodes and try to take advantage\nof those hours when airborne pollutant levels are lower.\n\nAt the public level there is a long-standing commitment to improve air\nquality. When you look at the air pollution levels in California today you can\nsee that a great deal of progress has been made. There has been a cost for this\nprogress. For instance, some products are more expensive. In return, the lower\nlevels of pollutant exposure compared to 20 years ago should decrease the\nadverse effect of air pollution on the long-term health of our developing\nchildren.\n\nBoth elemental and organic.

{"text":"Does clean air have a cost where it makes sense versus where it doesn't? What about human life in general?\n\nEconomists still try to create a metric and a group from the University of Chicago and MIT tackled the financial results of extensive environmental regulations, which have brought cleaner air and health improvements to the United States but also increased the cost of manufacturing and led to reduced industrial productivity along with outsourcing jobs. Some economists suggested that more and more regulations encourage companies to become more efficient, thus reducing costs at upgraded plants, but a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research contends that the regulations led to a 4.8 percent decline in productivity and reduced profits by nearly 9 percent from 1972-93. If that's all the negative impact it had, it would be an economic miracle.\n\n\"There are good reasons to think environmental regulations might increase production costs, but we didn't know how large the effect might be,\" said Chad Syverson, professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. \"We are not saying that the regulations are a bad idea, but we wanted to know the cost.\"\n\nThe paper examined how the total factor productivity (TFP) of manufacturing plants was impacted by the regulations, which went into effect as a result of the Clean Air Act of 1970. The annual cost to companies was about $21 billion, they said. The Clean Air Act provides a stringent intervention for companies that are found to be polluting. The EPA can dictate installation of pollution abatement technologies on manufacturing plants.\n\nBecause not all communities are impacted equally by air pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency each year designates counties as either being in attainment of the standards for air quality or in a nonattainment status. The standards cover ozone, total suspended particulates, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. The manufacturing plants in nonattainment counties are subject to strict enforcement. In order to determine the economic impact of the regulations, the scholars compared changes in the productivity of high-emissions manufacturing plants in non-compliant counties to those of low-emissions plants in those counties as well as high-emissions plants in compliant counties.\n\nThey based their work on data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau of company expenditures and profits. They found that the regulations impacted different kinds of manufacturers quite differently. \"The largest declines in TFP are associated with ozone nonattainment, which incidentally is one of the most commonly emitted pollutants among our industries,\" they wrote.\n\nTheir analysis found that the organic chemical industry \u2014 companies that produce turpentine or benzene, for instance \u2014 are the most impacted by the regulations. They experienced a 17 percent reduction in productivity during the study period in non-attainment counties. The industry is only regulated for ozone, but had an annual loss of $9.2 billion during the study period when measured in 2010 dollars.\n\nThey also looked at how companies increased their prices in order to compensate for their increased costs and studied the ready-mixed concrete industry specifically because it was a specialized industry that dealt with one common product. The study estimated that companies increased their prices by about one percent in response to the regulations. The approach used to studying the impact of regulations brought on by laws could possibly be expanded to study in the impact of other regulations, the scholars said.\n\n\"In principle, this approach can be applied to the costs of regulations that govern firm behavior in a wide range of contexts,\" the paper says. \"We envision similar exercises being fruitful in areas that regulate work and labor conditions, health and safety legislation.\"\n\nPaper: \"The Effects of Environmental Regulations on the Competitiveness of U.S. Manufacturing,\" Michael Greenstone, John List and Chad Syverson, National Bureau of Economic Research\n\nComments\n\nI wonder what the enforcement costs are for rape laws. I bet it's in the tens of billions annually, including cops, trials, incarceration and everything. And do rape laws really reduce rape?\n\nHate bad regulations? Guess what - everyone does. So improve them. You know what makes them bad? Industry interferes destructively in the process of writing them. Among other things.\n\nOf course the article is going to appeal to those who want deregulation (on GP, whether the regulations work or not). For some reason ozone doesn't bother them. Nothing bothers the anti-regulation crowd! They also embrace CO2, and scoff at the broad majority of scientists whom it worries. They embrace laissez-faire markets, and scoff at the broad majority of parents who cling to quaint child labor laws. It's a psychological thing. They think it's because they're smart, but it's really because they're socially disabled.\n\nIf there was money in rape, there'd be lobbyists. And pseudo-neo-hemi-libertarian cheerleaders.\n\nAnd remember it's supposed to be about ozone. In the big picture, ozone is a bigger deal than concrete. Y'all so smart? Figure out the very best way to maximize one and minimize the other.\n\nThe environment is actually a bigger deal than the economy. And look around. Pick a topic. I don't mean to sound alarmist - I don't think I am an alarmist - but the natural world is coming apart at the seams. Pick a topic.\n\nIt's absurd, but - if you had to choose one or the other, the economy or the environment, which would it be? I can't think of another thing, or any list of things together, that is a tenth as important as the environment, including the human race, or even mammalia, or even the terapods. It's more important than taxes and jobs and profits and even war, and peace, and children, and everything; than all that put together. It's past time we acted like it. It's a bit too late, actually.\n\nWho said you can't have both? You have one metric that is subjective and other people have a different one. That is what a policy discussion is. What size check are you willing to write for a cleaner environment? Whatever that number is, multiply it by 310 million and that can be the budget for ecological priorities but you will see it doesn't go far. In reality, a whole lot of other people prioritize ecology over money far more than you do already, why make it sound like it isn't obvious?\n\nOf course we can have both - but do we? And I don't think it -is- obvious; not to enough people, or the right people, or enough of the right people.\n\nMy \"subjective\" metric is based on a bunch of objective metrics - ocean acidification, habitat destruction, deforestation, accelerating extinctions, declining fisheries, shrinking reefs, population growth, growing global industrialization... I've lived long enough to watch it happening. All these things are getting worse, most of them at accelerating rates.\n\n40 years ago, a certain fraction of the public reacted negatively to the alarming reports of people like Rachel Carson, Barry Commoner, Jacques Cousteau. It was psychological - the evidence wasn't in, so it couldn't have been rational. The evidence is in now, and the deniers have been forced to slowly capitulate one fact at a time, but too slow, too late. What little has been done has been oriented toward human health which, while important to individual humans, isn't going to save the species or the planet.\n\nIf the budget for ecological priorities doesn't go very far, then it needs to go farther. You'd leave it up to the market? I should decide how much I would \"spend\" on the environment? Is that how societies address global problems? Is that how we wage war, fight disease, plan superhighways? Through individual consumerism? Bosh!\n\nActually, that's exactly how we do it. Johnson knew better than to even run for re-election because of his handling of Viet Nam and his squandering of 1950s prosperity. Carter and George H.W. Bush also did the math incorrectly.\n\nEisenhower planned highways because there was a metric. Fax machines had a metric too, because obviously the first fax machine had no immediate value. What is the metric for ocean acidification, since no one can even make a numerical model of how it happens, why it happens, or what it will be like 2 years from now based on any number of knobs to turn? What would you ban to stop it? If it isn't quantifiable it can't get done, plain and simple. Sorry if that violates your 'my beliefs are worth any cost' mentality but that is the real world.\n\nNah. You're mixing the funding of Grand Projects with politics. There was no \"metric\" for going into Vietnam, but the money was found. We're still paying for it. It was a priority among the decision makers. Ecology is not.\n\nIt's not my beliefs or my mentality. I personally don't matter, nor does what I believe. It's acidification, or deforestation. You can dismiss me, but how can you dismiss those?\n\nThe \"real\" world is the earth and the ecology. The false world is the one of metrics and knobs. Those are useful inasmuch as they give us a handle on the elusive reality of the world, but they're worse than useless when they obfuscate the realities.\n\nAcidification is a product of CO2 emissions. That's what I would \"ban.\" Or, contain. ASAP.\n\nThe problem becomes that sometimes the magic bullet is not magic. We thought banning some emissions would solve the ozone problem too. Then it turned out not to be the case at all. That money can never be recovered so it was a pointless expense for consumers and businesses, only the government unions benefited. More of that is not helping anyone.\n\nThere is no evidence at all banning CO2, all of it made by man, would actually fix climate change, because CO2 is not a magic bullet and your beliefs on ocean health are too simplistic, recursive even, since ocean acidification was invented to account for increased CO2 intake and was not a problem scientifically found and then its driver (CO2) discovered due to research.\n\nOcean acidification, like anything else, has a lot of knobs to turn. I use the term 'magic bullet' because that is how a cursory look at science (and certainly mainstream media discussions) portray science. We endured 40 years of a 'war on cancer' and 'finding a cure' when 100% of scientists and educated people knew it was impossible and said nothing while we spent a trillion dollars to do...what, exactly? Cancer is more treatable but if you have stage 2 breast cancer, quite moderate, you have a 30% chance of recurrence and it only goes down to about 15% even if you do radiation, chemo, pills and surgery - and that is a good result. But was it worth a trillion dollars? If people knew it would be a trillion dollars would they have signed off on it?\n\nIf we knew it would be a trillion dollars to solve emissions, would we spend it? Sure, why not? but what gets less coverage in media is that virtually no one disagrees about CO2 - not Republicans, Democrats, deniers, skeptics, no one. Feedbacks are another matter entirely, because they are entirely the result of numerical models, not science. Can a computer program predict who will win the World Series? Nope. So believing it can predict something as infinitely more complicated like climate is nonsensical.\n\nWe created CO2 dependence in America by banning clean energy, like nuclear power, and activists forced us to use coal instead. In 40 years, American ingenuity would have led the world in safe nuclear power and CO2 would be nonexistent. Would climate change have still happened? If so, then CO2 is not the core issue. American CO2 levels are back near what the Kyoto treaty wanted and coal CO2 emissions are down to 1983 levels, when we were still worried about a new ice age, and yet climate change is still happening. What explains that?\n\nAgain, what should be done, about anything? It seems you think we're entirely paralyzed by lack of understanding.\n\nI bet the outcome of a future world series is much harder to predict than climate.\n\nIn fact, cancer treatment has improved dramatically. Was it worth a trillion dollars? IDK. (Did it cost that? IDK.) But did it work? To a great extent it has worked. I myself know people who are alive today who would probably have died of their cancer 20-40 years ago. I think the scientists who seek \"a cure\" for cancer know that what they mean is, they seek a deep enough understanding of cancer to be able to treat it effectively - and they're getting there. Talk about \"a cure,\" as if cancer were polio, is a short hand for the uninformed.\n\nPreserving the natural ecological balances is about 7 billion times more important than cancer. Talk about a complex system, where outcomes are hard to predict!!! And the stakes are even higher than the world series.\n\nCoal beat nuclear because of price. Mostly. Activists? Honestly, no one cares what activists say. Coal is cheap, and many countries have plenty. It's also worse in every (?) respect than nuclear power. It was left up to the market. People didn't want to pay for it. Ignorance and idealism prevented others who knew better from making the right decisions. It shouldn't have been left up to the market, and the nay-sayers should have been educated by those who knew better.\n\nNuclear energy was also handicapped by being controlled by the DoE, which was 99% concerned with making bombs. Probably (from what I hear, IDK) we should have been using thorium reactors all this time. Probably safety and clean-up should have been prioritized from the start instead of externalized.\n\nI can't make any sense of this last comment of yours. Is this conspiracy theory? The DoE was obsessed with bombs so America canceled nuclear power plants too? What?\n\nI am not of the 'we should do something even if it is wrong' mindset. I know that puts me in a different place than activists. We need to find out what has the greatest impact on ecology and then replace it. It's that simple. But we do not know that yet. A whole bunch of people spending someone else's money think they know but I have not seen one numerical model created by academics in climate science related to ocean acidification that would not get them fired from a real software company.\n\nNo, not a conspiracy. An unfortunate and sub-optimal diversion of efforts. Bombs were prioritized, so (better?) reactor technologies (which didn't produce weapons materials) were set aside. (Thorium? Breeders?) Most of the worst (most radioactive, polluted) nuclear sites were DoE sites, not commercial reactors.\n\nAmerica cancelled nuclear projects because they were uninsurable, and not profitable compared to coal. Public sentiment played a lesser role (much less). The real obstacle was cost. It still is - but we should do it anyway.\n\nI am also not of the 'we should do something even if it is wrong' mindset. We need to find out what has the greatest impact on ecology and then replace it? There are thousands of inputs. Each and every one needs to be assessed, examined and improved. Yes, rationally, but also urgently. If a car is heading for a cliff, it's not absolutely essential that we know the exact speed the car is going and the exact distance to the edge of the cliff - what's important is hitting the brakes. I'd feel better about a driver who was \"doing something even if it was wrong' than one who said they didn't know what to do, or OMFG, it's part of the natural order and we'll just adapt to free fall. Or, it's too expensive to put unscheduled wear and tear on the brakes.\n\nHa ha. I love your car analogy but surely even a bonobo can turn the wheel and change direction away from the cliff edge, regardless of whether they can reach the brakes or its right or wrong to do so?\n\nThe natural world is falling apart? Yes and it does so, naturally. If a super volcano goes off, the damage we are doing is a mere snail's fart and we should assume the effects would be unfortunate. There is forest after forest, ocean after ocean and mountain after mountain - falling apart? Not really, but if we can keep our national forests and reserves national and safe from market rationality and psychopaths I would think it better than some 'internationalist' ownership alternative. The climate is changing like the cycles of seasons and the procession of the equinoxes, yes, like our ancestors have attempted to pass down to us all in refined symbology ...Bull, Ram, Fish and so on. What is falling apart is civilisation and if you can't see that...well, you're probably travelling around the countries that aren't still sacrificing the blood of the innocent for an indulgent and fantasy-filled lifestyle. We don't live in the age of peace and the environment yet. Certainly not when there is a never-ending war on terror, a monumentally rich arms industry and the infinite perversion of 'what is value'. We still live in an age of materialistic, social and psychological exploitation and the glorification of ego. Market wisely. Live self sufficiently."}

Usually eliminating the source and installing better filtration and proper ventilation can resolve the problem. Some of the following symptoms can be cause by poor indoor air quality; sore eyes, fatigue, burning in the eyes and throat, worsened allergies, respiratory illness, heart disease, cancer, etc.\nCommon pollutants found in homes are radon, second hand smoke, combustible pollutants, VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), asthma triggers, and mold. The average homeowner can be unaware combustible pollutants such as fuel burning appliances can release gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.

{"text":"Improper Venting Of Gas Space Heaters Can Lead To Carbon Monoxide Poisoning\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association (GAMA) are warning people to have their vented gas space heaters professionally inspected every year to avoid carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.\n\nAccording to the CPSC, improper venting is the primary cause of CO poisoning from propane and natural gas space heaters. If the heater is not vented properly, not vented at all, or if the vent is blocked, rusted or corroded, dangerous levels of carbon monoxide can enter the home causing sickness and death. CO can also be produced if the heater is not properly set up and adjusted for the type of gas used and altitude at which it is installed.\n\n\"Vented space heaters provide safe, energy-efficient heat,\" said C. Reuben Autery, president of GAMA. \"In order to maintain their safety, space heaters should be installed by a professional contractor and inspected every year. In addition to identifying and correcting problems with the venting, professionals are familiar with local codes.\" The CPSC and GAMA warn people not to install used space heaters.\n\n\"Each year, carbon monoxide poisoning kills more than 200 people and sends 5,000 more to the hospital emergency rooms,\" said CPSC Chairman Ann Brown. \"Many of these poisonings can be avoided if consumers work with home heating professionals to make sure their appliances are properly installed.\"\n\nCarbon monoxide is extremely dangerous because it is invisible and odorless, and its symptoms are similar to common illnesses like the flu. Accidents are often fatal when dangerous levels of CO enter the home while people are sleeping. Carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms include headache, dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, vomiting and confusion.\n\nAccording to Autery, the best time to have a heater professionally inspected is prior to the heating season. \"Problems with the vent can develop if the heater goes a few months without being used, like rusting, clogging with loose bricks, even birds nests. We can't emphasize enough the importance of annual inspections,\" he added.\n\nFor free information about vented gas heater safety, call 1-800-603-9293.

{"text":"Document Actions\n\nTwenty years after amendments to the Clean Air Act authorized the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate additional toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants, the agency is finally flexing its muscle. New rules proposed this month would cut mercury emissions along with other dangerous metals like arsenic, chromium and nickel and particulate matter from oil- and coal-fired power plants. The EPA cites tremendous health benefits -- and the substantial associated monetary savings -- from limiting these dangerous emissions, but industry proponents and many Republican lawmakers argue that the rules would cripple an already limping economy.\n\nAccording to the EPA (pdf), coal-fired powered power plants are the largest source of mercury, which settles into water, accumulates in plants and animals and causes birth defects if pregnant women eat contaminated fish and seafood. In addition, smog and other air pollution from power plants trigger asthma, bronchitis and even heart conditions.\n\nIt's the responsibility of the EPA, according to the Clean Air Act, to regulate these emissions in order to protect public health. To date, though, the EPA has failed to regulate emissions from power plants, first by simply omitting power plants from a list of industries to be regulated and then by delaying and sidestepping the obligations. Then in February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals said the EPA broke the law by not using the Clean Air Act to reduce toxic air pollution from coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe agency's new rules, finally introduced on March 16 will eliminate thousands of premature deaths, hospital visits and heart attacks while creating 40,000 short-term and permanent jobs. The new standards would affect about 525 power plants at an estimated cost of $10.9 billion per year by 2016, the date by which the plants have to be in compliance.\n\nOthers accept the EPA's assessment that the benefits of the regulations outweigh the costs. \"Dirty air makes children sick, that's the long and short of it,\" said Marion Burton, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics when EPA Administration Lisa Jackson announced the new rules for power plants. \"If you think it's expensive to install a scrubber, you should see how much it costs to treat a child born with a birth defect that was prevent"}
{"text":"Study shows autism risk for developing children exposed to air pollution\n\nResearch conducted by University of Southern California (USC) and Children's Hospital Los Angeles scientists demonstrates that polluted air \u2013 whether regional pollution or coming from local traffic sources \u2013 is associated with autism.\n\nThe study titled \"Traffic Related Air Pollution, Particulate Matter, and Autism,\" shows that exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy and the first year of life is associated with a more than two-fold risk of autism. In addition, exposure to regional pollution consisting of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and small particles \u2013 particulate matter less than 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter (PM2.5 and PM10) \u2013 is also associated with autism even if the mother did not live near a busy road. The study is published in the Archives of General Psychiatry, a sister publication of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n\"This work has broad potential public health implications,\" said the study's principal investigator, Heather Volk, Ph.D., assistant professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and investigator in the Division of Research on Children, Youth and Families at Keck School-affiliated Children's Hospital Los Angeles. \"We've known for a long time that air pollution is bad for our lungs, and especially for children. We're now beginning to understand how air pollution may affect the brain.\"\n\nThe research is the first to look at the amount of near-roadway traffic pollution individuals were exposed to and combine that with measures of regional air quality. The study builds on previous research by Volk and colleagues that examined how close subjects lived to a freeway, said Volk, who also has appointments at the Keck School's Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute and Department of Pediatrics.\n\n\"We took into account how far away people lived from roads, meteorology such as which way the wind was blowing, how busy the road was, and other factors to study traffic-related pollution,\" she said. \"We also examined data from air quality monitors, which measure pollution over a larger region that could come from traffic, industry, rail yards, or many other sources.\"\n\nIn the 2012 study, Volk and colleagues from USC and the University of California, Davis examined data on 279 autism cases and 245 control subjects enrolled in the California-based Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) study. Mothers' addresses from birth certificates and addresses reported from a residential history were used to estimate exposure during each trimester of pregnancy and the first year of life. The researchers used air pollution levels derived from the Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality System to determine exposure to NO2, PM2.5, and PM10. They also applied dispersion models to estimate the amount of traffic the mothers and children were exposed to.\n\nParticularly interesting was the effect of mothers' and children's exposure to particles, both PM10 and PM2.5. PM10 includes both coarse and fine particles, while PM2.5 includes only the smaller (fine) particles, which are most likely to have deleterious effects on the human body.\n\n\"From studies conducted in the lab, we know that we can breathe in tiny particles and they can produce inflammation,\" said Volk. \"Particles have varied composition, and there are many chemicals that can bind to them. The components of these particles could be hazardous to the brain.\"\n\nOther researchers who participated in the study include Irva Hertz-Picciotto, University of California, Davis; Rob McConnell from USC; and Fred Lurmann and Bryan Penfold from Sonoma Technology, Inc.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (grant 1 R21 ES019002-01).\n\nVolk and colleagues are now at work on a study of how genes related to autism may be affected by environmental exposures to try to identify if there are factors that make people are genetically more vulnerable to particular pollutants"}

{"text":"Cleaner-air rewards\n\nWritten by Rosa Colucci on Wednesday, 28 January 2009 3:29 am.\n\nCleaner air, longer life -- is there a better reward?\n\nThe study conducted by Brigham Young University and the Harvard School of Public Health described in Don Hopey's article \"Cleaner Air Is Giving Longer Life to Region\" (Jan. 22) confirms that efforts to improve air quality are allowing us to live longer, healthier lives. Pittsburghers' life expectancy rose by more than two years from 1980 through 2000.\n\nWe've made great progress in recent decades, but as current regional air monitoring data make abundantly clear, work remains to be done. One straightforward way to achieve further reductions is by targeting particulate matter from diesel vehicles. Diesel particulate matter is a toxic air contaminant and a significant source of fine particulates in our region. Once emitted, diesel exhaust is inescapable -- it is emitted at ground level where it can be readily inhaled by commuters, pedestrians and children riding diesel-powered school buses. The good news is that existing technology can reduce diesel exhaust particulates by more than 90 percent.\n\nThe Allegheny County Partnership to Reduce Diesel Pollution, led by the Group Against Smog and Pollution and Clean Water Action, is tackling diesel pollution through several local initiatives that will result in diesel emission reductions from school buses, waste haulers and construction equipment. Trucks, transit buses, school buses, waste haulers, construction equipment, locomotives and marine vessels all contribute to the diesel pollution problem in Pittsburgh.\n\nEach must be addressed in any effective cleanup solution.

{"text":"Carbon Monoxide (CO) cannot be tasted and has no smell giving no opportunity to detect this dangerous gas. The gas is a by product of combustion with insufficient oxygen supply such as can happen in a poorly ventilated boiler. The standard flue gases from a boiler, or other gas appliance such as a gas fire, contain Carbon Dioxide, this is displaced by Carbon Monoxide when the oxygen levels are reduced. Building regulations prescribing ventilation requirements and the widespread availability gas appliance servicing services has reduced the incidence of Carbon Monoxide poisoning although there are still 30 deaths per year.\n\nHow dangerous is Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?\n\nCarbon monoxide kills so do not take any risks if you suspect you may be suffering from inhalation of the gas. It is better to act quickly if you spot any symptoms as prevarication could lead to a death. Take action to protect yourself and your family quickly. Any member of the family can be affected by carbon monoxide regardless of their age. Pets, large and small, are also potential victims.\n\nWhat should I look for as early signs of poisoning from carbon monoxide?\n\nA CORGI certified gas engineer should be brought in to inspect your gas appliances if you notice these symptoms in your family. Whilst waiting for the engineer to arrive you should ensure that you have opened the windows and everyone has left the house.\n\nHow do I protect my family from Carbon Monoxide and potential poisoning?\n\nBad ventilation resulting in lack of oxygen leads to the production of poisonous carbon monoxide. Assuming that a ventilation audit of your proposed installation was completed before your boiler was fitted the best defence to this is the regular and expert servicing of any gas appliances that you have including your boiler. A CORGI-registered engineer should be employed to service your gas appliances. Carbon monoxide detectors, carrying a British Standard kite mark, are an important addition to a plan to protect your home against possible poisoning by CO gas. Air ventilation bricks and panels should be kept clear and checked throughout the year to make sure that the planned air flow is maintained to your gas appliances. Garden plants can also be a danger to you as growth throughout the summer can block air vents to a boiler which may not be in operation until the cold weather returns. Birds can often build nests in chimneys and block the airflow to gas appliances without you knowing, a visual inspection from the ground should be included within your ventilation action plan. Ensure that you are aware of the different sounds from your smoke alarms and your CO alarms. If the carbon monoxide detector alarm sounds be certain that it was your CO detector and not your smoke detector.\n\nWhat will I see if I have a carbon monoxide issue in my home?\n\nGas combustion in an oxygen poor atmosphere can produce visible deposits which can discolour gas appliances and the walls surrounding them. Another way to check for gas burning problems is to inspect pilot lights and see whether they are burning with a yellow or other colour flame rather than the blue light of a well maintained system. Treat the pilot light like a traffic light, if it turns yellow this is a warning and you should arrange for the boiler to be serviced as quickly as you can.\n\nAre you able to purchase carbon monoxide detectors?\n\nCarbon monoxide detectors can be effective in preventing incidences of carbon monoxide poisoning. You know have a choice of detector types and most of these are available in the shops or online. The gradual accumulation of carbon monoxide gas over time will lead to the detector being set off. Smoke detectors have become a standard feature in homes and the technology is reliable, CO detectors are not yet as reliable but the technology is making rapid strides. You should ensure you have regular servicing of your appliances and treat your carbon monoxide detector as a secondary, backup measure. It is not your first line of defence.\n\nWhat are the features of a good detector?\n\nGood quality carbon monoxide detectors have a loud alarm and are certified to British Standards. Such alarms have long lasting batteries (5 years) and the alarm is triggered when abnormal levels of carbon monoxide are detected enabling people to escape the area. Cheaper CO detectors have a coloured spot that changes colour when carbon monoxide levels rise and these should not be used in preference to a battery alarm. With a colour change detector you may forget to replace the detector when it has expired after 6 months creating a risk. Also the lack of an alarm means that you may not be made aware of a problem in the critical early hours. Chemical detectors lack of loud alarms prevents them from waking your family at night time if CO levels rise and this could be a major safety issue. In addition to do it yourself stores carrying these detectors you may be able to purchase an approved model from your utility company.\n\nInstall a carbon monoxide detector to protect your home\n\nEarly advice of rising levels of CO can give people enough time to leave a building before the symptoms of CO poisoning occur. The installation of CO detectors gives this warning. The levels at which carbon monoxide detectors are triggered are measured against the level of gas that would start to harm a healthy adult. As such you need to act quickly when children could have been exposed to the emissions as they can be harmed by lower levels of the gas. Smoke detectors are installed near the ceiling as smoke rises, this is not true of carbon monoxide and hence these detectors can be installed lower on the wall. Carbon Monoxide detectors should be installed where the alarm can be heard from your bedroom, you need to be woken quickly should the alarm be triggered.\n\nThe operation of detectors must be checked frequently\n\nAs with all safety equipment a detector should be tested throughout the year to make sure that it is working effectively. Detectors should come with instructions detailing the steps to take to check the effective functioning of the detector. Test CO alarms at least once a month and replace them according to the service instructions if found to be defective. The 'test' feature on many detectors checks the functioning of the alarm and not the status of the detector. You should note when the detector needs to be replaced, some have an operating life of only 48 months. Some models of detector have lifespans up to 5 years some are mains powered, others are battery powered. You should shop around to select the model that meets your needs. To save space there are combination smoke and CO detectors sold, you should check the manufacturer installation instructions for how to install these."}
{"text":"Raising the Flag for Air Quality Awareness\n\n2011 May 2\n\nLast week, I joined security officer William Jones when he visited a group of students at the First Environments Day Care Center located on EPA's Research Triangle Park campus. The purpose of our trip was to raise a yellow flag on the pole in front of the school.\n\nWhen Officer Jones asked if the kids wanted to help him, they cheered in unison, \"YES.\" They eagerly held the flag while Officer Jones hooked it to the chain, watched as he raised it \u2013 and promptly asked why the flag was yellow. Officer Jones explained that the yellow flag meant that the kids could play outside, \"because the air quality was pretty good today\u2013 not the best like what a green flag means.\"\n\nSchools in a number of areas across the country are raising the colored flags to help their teachers and parents track EPA's daily Air Quality Index (AQI). These flags help students and teachers know what the air quality forecast is for the day, and help them track whether students' asthma symptoms get worse when the air is polluted and whether they need to take extra steps to protect their health.\n\nLater this week, the Bethesda Elementary School in Durham, N.C. will launch its school flag program as part of Air Quality Awareness Week, marked every May to remind Americans to check the AQI forecast in planning outdoor activities. The school will fly an air quality flag along with the American flag each day.\n\nWhen you see a green or yellow flag at school, it means that teachers and coaches will encourage students to get outside and get moving! When the flag is orange or red, it is still OK to play outside, but kids are encouraged to cut back on activities that involve lots of running. On those days, teachers and coaches will also make indoor exercise space available for children who need it.\n\nThe flags also help parents by reminding them of the day's air quality forecast when they drop their children off at school, and assuring them that teachers will reduce their children's exposure to air pollution, while ensuring they get important play and exercise time.\n\nAbout the author: Amy J. Gaskill, APR, works in the Innovative Programs and Outreach Group in EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning & Standards\n\nEditor's Note: The opinions expressed in Greenversations are those of the author.

{"text":"Thursday, December 08, 2011\n\nAs more awareness is put toward investigating the sources of toxins within the environment, it becomes surprisingly apparent that there is exposure in more places than would ever be considered otherwise. One startling example is in the source of that all too familiar \"new car smell\" that so many look forward to as part and parcel of the initiation of owning a brand new car.\n\nIt is almost a right of passage, or a badge of honor. Unfortunately, it has been recently discovered that the source of this aroma that fulfills so many emotional \"highs\" is associated with the toxic chemical soup permeating the interior of new cars at levels that pose a danger to the health of their occupants. It has been known for some time that the headliners of older vehicles contained asbestos, as do drums and brake pads, and some areas within the transmission. Exposure to asbestos has been proven to cause mesothelioma, a form of cancer that is potentially deadly, and this is a situation that has been systematically approached with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) providing guidelines for years.\n\nInformal studies in the U.S. have produced a list of other chemicals associated with the interior air quality of new vehicles, prompting a response from around the globe in a best approach to determining just how toxic this chemical soup really is. Aside from the obvious toxins, such as carbon monoxide from exhaust and benzene from the air conditioning, scientists have reported over fifty volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have been identified from a variety of sources.\n\nTests have revealed that these chemicals have been linked to neurological impairment, birth defects, premature puberty in lab test animals, liver toxicity, and other serious health problems.\n\nWhile this is startling information, it has prompted further analytical testing to determine ways in which these chemicals can be mitigated. In the immediate, the good news is that these chemicals begin to decay exponentially as soon as the vehicles leave the assembly line, but only at about 20% per week, reaching an acceptable level after about six months time.\n\nClearly, there are air purifiers that can be purchased and have proven to help filter out measurable volumes. Running the A.C. with the windows open prior to entering the vehicle will help to dissipate the blast of benzene. It is certainly an issue to remain tuned in to for future conclusions and alternatives.\n\nThis post has been submitted by Brian, who vey kindly offered to have it posted! Thank you very much Brian for your great post!\n\nSaturday, May 21, 2011\n\nAston has unveiled the stunning V12 Zagato! Below are some bits from the official press release.\n\n\"The V12 Zagato is an elegant yet brutal design which reflects the great balance between race performance and pure Aston Martin style. TheWorking alongside the initial design team was a dedicated group of Aston Martin engineers led by Chris Porritt - previously responsible for the engineering of the One-77. With the skills and knowledge gained from such specialised projects this team has worked to bring the unique design of the V12 Zagato to reality in a very short period of time.\n\nFeaturing a new handcrafted aluminium body, the V12 Zagato delivers a beautiful and muscular design not possible using pre-formed panel techniques. Using the influences and skill of nearly 100 years of heritage in the craft, every aluminium panel was formed using an English wheel and traditionally crafted body bucks. Each front wing alone comprises seven separate pieces of aluminium, combined and then hand finished to give one flowing form. Another iconic Zagato design cue is the double bubble roof created in this case from five separate pieces illustrating further the intensity of craftsmanship involved in the construction of the V12 Zagato.\n\nDesigned for the focused driver, the V12 Zagato has been honed with pure driving enjoyment in mind. The V12 Zagato combines Aston Martin's most dynamic bonded aluminium platform with the power of the 6.0-litre V12 engine producing 510 bhp (380 kW \/ 517 PS), and 570 Nm (420 lb ft) of torque.\n\nThe racing debut of the V12 Zagato will be at the four hour VLN race at N\u00fcrburgring on 28th May with a view to two cars racing at the 24 hour race on 25\/26 June. The cars will be driven by a team with great experience of Aston Martin race cars, led for the sixth year by Chief Executive Dr. Ulrich Bez.\""}

{"text":"The health effects of fossil fuel derived particles. (Review).\n\nArchives of Disease in Childhood\n\nOver the past 10 years there has been increasing evidence that particles generated by the combustion of fossil fuels adversely affect health. To what extent should paediatricians be concerned about particle pollution? This review assesses what we know, and what we still need to know about the health effects of fossil fuel particles.\n\nSince the early 1990s there has been increasing evidence that particles generated by the combustion of fossil fuels adversely affect health. In January 2001. the UK government was sufficiently concerned to issue a warning when air pollution levels for particulates were forecast to be high across most of the UK. (1) Hourly updates on particle levels across the country were, and still are available on the internet ( accessed 1\/12\/01), or on a freephone number. The minister for the environment at the time, Michael Meacher, commented: \"I have taken the precautionary step of making sure vulnerable people, such as those with heart and lung disease, are aware and can take appropriate measures to reduce their exposure\" (1). children were not specifically identified in this warning, but to what extent should paediatricians be concerned about particle pollution?\n\nSOURCES OF PARTICLES\n\nPolluted air is a complex mixture of vaporous, liquid, and solid components (fig 1). There are major qualitative and quantitative differences in this mixture, depending on emission sources, geographical location, weather conditions, time of day, and season. Irrespective of these variations, particles from internal combustion engines are a consistent contributor to the particle fraction of the pollutant mix. Although petrol engines emit particles, diesel engines, especially heavy duty engines, are a major emission source as they emit 100 times more particles than do petrol engines of corresponding performance. Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) are defined as \"primary\" particles-- that is, they are emitted directly and are not formed in the atmosphere. DEP consist of a carbonaceous core (fig 2) onto which over 18 000 different high molecular weight compounds are adsorbed. (2) DEP are regarded as the prototypic pollutant particle, but there are other types of particles, such as natural wind blown dusts, and sulphat e from gas-to-particle interactions in the atmosphere (secondary particles). The health effects of the combustion of biofuels (wood, agricultural residues, and dung) are not discussed in this review, but they are a major source of particles in rural underdeveloped countries.\n\nPARTICLE MEASUREMENT\n\nOlder monitoring devices for primary particles suck in a volume of air, and measure the total mass of suspended particles, irrespective of size. current samplers determine the mass of particulate matter (PM) in diameters under 10 [micro]m ([PM.sub.10]), and under 2.5 % [micro]m [micro]m (fine particles, [PM.sub.2.5]). These measurements are more relevant to health effects as [PM.sub.10] corresponds to the \"inhalable\" fraction, and [PM.sub.2.5] is the size that is most likely to penetrate deepest into the airways. Another important component of [PM.sub.10] in terms of number but not mass, are ultrafine (UF) particles of less than 0.1 [micro]m in diameter (3); 10 (9) UF particles have the same mass as one \"coarse\" particle of 10 [micro]m diameter, and readily penetrate into houses through walls. (4) In general, the \"naturally\" generated particles such as wind blown soils fall into the coarse fraction of [PM.sub.10] (less than 10 [micro]m and greater than 2.5 [micro]m), whereas fossil fuel combustion is the majo r source of smaller particles ([PM.sub.2.5] and UP). (5)\n\nTOXICITY AND PARTICLE SIZE\n\nAlthough particle concentrations in ambient air may change in parallel to gaseous pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, it is possible to identify the independent effect of [PM.sub.10] in large studies. (6) By contrast, there is a high degree of intercorrelation between the coarse, fine (0.1--2.5 [micro]m), and UF particles, and it is difficult to pinpoint which fraction of [PM.sub.10] is the most toxic. From a public health perspective this may not be a problem, as long as the emission source can be identified. However, vehicle manufacturers need to know the size and composition of the most toxic fraction. \u2026"}
{"text":"London delivers clean games\n\nLondon 2012 produced one of Team GB's most successful medal hauls, but it might also be one of the least polluted games in history.\n\nScientists have taken to the skies around London's M25 to measure key markers of pollution, and conclude that the London 2012 Olympic Games are one of the least polluted thanks to the appalling weather before the games.\n\nAs part of the Clearflo \u2013 Clean Air for London \u2013 project, atmospheric scientists have been monitoring air and ground conditions. For the last two years they have measured carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and aerosol levels, trying to establish what happens to urban pollution and where it goes.\n\n\"Put simply, the reason the air quality is so good is because the weather has been so bad this summer,\" said Dr Grant Allen from the University of Manchester. \"The areas of low pressure have left us with very clean air, unusually clean for summer months over the UK. The pollution that is generated moves away in the evenings and goes in variety of directions depending on wind direction.\"\n\nThe Olympics have provided an excellent case study for the scientists, since traffic levels and activity have been monitored closely and quantified, said Allen.\n\nScientists have monitored pollution levels during the Games, looking for a tell-tale shift in the pollution regimes. As a result, Allen hopes to more accurately predict air quality for London in the future, as well as a better understanding of how London pollution affects those downwind.\n\n\"With more accurate predictions, we can hope to mitigate the known health impacts associated with poor air quality,\" he said. \"By sampling the air going into and coming out of London with the aircraft, and using measurements on the ground within the city itself, we can say something about what was added to the air as it passed over London and what this means for those living downwind"}
{"text":"Many problems in the society today are centered on air pollution. And compared to other kinds of pollution, air pollution is something that merits attention from people all over.\n\nAir pollution is when chemicals, and other types of matter, whether naturally or synthetically produced, are exposed in the atmosphere. This exposure potentially causes hazards not only to human life, but to other living organisms and the environment as well.\n\nAir pollutants, any substance that can potentially cause harm to the atmosphere and to humans are the main focus in maintaining and controlling air quality. They can come from primary sources (directly from human activities or natural occurrences), or secondary sources (from reactions and interactions in the atmosphere). However, some pollutants can be a mix of both primary and secondary\u2014being harmful on their own, and still capable of mixing with other substances.\n\nIf left alone, these pollutants can cause anything from asthma, to serious health concerns for humans such as cancer and pneumonia, even affecting birth rates in the long run.\n\nFacts, Figures and Definitions\n\nIt is estimated that air pollution causes over two million deaths per year\u2014directly and indirectly. What is especially alarming is the fact that exposure to air pollution is out of the individual's hands; it comes with the environment. The task therefore is air quality control should be initiated by governments and other authorities to start programs, and make laws regarding the control and improvement of air quality. However, at the end of the day, it is up to individuals to follow and adhere to these rules and regulations.\n\nOver the years, reduction efforts have been set in motion. Technological innovations and certain laws and regulations have been implemented to address the growing concern of air pollution. A huge setback despite the existence of this kind of technology is the fact that they are expensive to produce and maintain.\n\nAir pollutants are generally broken down into the following:\n\n*Particulates \u2014 tiny solid or liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere and are usually what air quality control machines clean out and\/or regulate\n\n*Nitrogen Oxide \u2014 a result of the combustion of air and fuel in engines, resulting in highly toxic mixtures of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen\n\n*Volatile Organic Compounds \u2014 organic chemical compounds that can participate in photoreaction, it has high vapor pressure and low water solubility\n\n*Mercury \u2014 highly dangerous to humans, it is a common contaminant in water and air supplies\n\n*Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins \u2014 commonly known as dioxins, they accumulate in wildlife and come from daily activities of combustion and burning\n\nControl devices destroy or break down the harmful chemicals or substances in machines before they are exposed to the atmosphere. Specific machines or devices are used in controlling and breaking down specific particles and substances. Here are a few that are currently being used:\n\nParticulate Control:\n\n*dust cyclones\n\n*electrostatic precipitators\n\n*baghouses\n\n*particulate scrubbers\n\nScrubbers:\n\n*baffle spray scrubber\n\n*cyclonic spray scrubber\n\n*ejector venture scrubber\n\n*mechanically aided scrubber\n\n*spray tower\n\n*wet scrubber\n\nNOx Control:\n\n*low NOx burners\n\n*selective catalytic reduction\n\n*selective non-catalytic reduction\n\n*NOx scrubbers\n\n*exhaust gas recirculation\n\n*catalytic converter\n\nVOC abatement:\n\n*absorption systems\n\n*flares\n\n*thermal oxidizers\n\n*catalytic oxidizers\n\n*biofilters\n\n*absorption\n\n*cryogenic condensers\n\n*vapor recovery systems\n\nAcid Gas control:\n\n*wet scrubbers\n\n*dry scrubbers\n\n*flue gas desulfurization\n\nMercury control:\n\n*sorbent injection technology\n\n*electro-catalytic oxidation\n\n*K-Fuel\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it is very expensive to maintain and produce such technologies. Also, implementing rules and regulations on air pollution control can be very challenging for governments and organizations because of the radical change in activities and procedures that they call for.\n\nAir Quality Control: Enter the United States\n\nThe United States however, has enough resources and infrastructures to implement, sustain, and support these systems and technologies. Numerous acts and amendments have been made to adjust to the specific changes that the changing environment and atmosphere call for.\n\nOne such act is the Clean Air Act. Implemented by the United States with the regulation of smog and air pollution, this arguably started a world-wide re-evaluation of practices and legal substances.\n\nFirst among such acts was the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955. This was mainly in addressing and recognizing air pollution as an environmental problem, and was focused more on informing the general public of the dangers of then unknown pollutants. No specific provisions on how to regulate or control the problem of air pollution was passed yet, nor were any punishments for polluters and measuring degrees of pollution established.\n\nFollowing the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 was the Clean Air Act of 1963. The one passed in 1963 was a moderate bill that gave suggestions, support, and aid to state control agencies with regards to the problem of air pollution. An amendment in 1965 introduced regulations and a more active participation by the federal government.\n\nHowever, the Clean Air Act of 1970 was the first direct and specific action towards addressing pollutants and starting programs for air pollution control. The act is a federal law that requires the Environmental Protection Agency to make and enforce regulations that will protect the general public from substances that are hazardous to human health. This is arguably the first environmental law in the United States to provide provisions for citizen suits.\n\nThe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 proposed emissions trading, which is exchanging economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants. Cap limits are set to countries. If they go over their assigned cap rates, then they have to purchase cap space from other countries with lower emissions, thus exchanging \"air space\" for money.\n\nSuch trading systems have already been tried and implemented in the United States, among them the Acid Rain Program, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (for volatile organic compounds), and the Chicago Climate Exchange (tackling Carbon Dioxide allowances).\n\nWith such laws and rules in implementation, why is it that the overall situation seems to either be at a stand still, or progressing slowly at most?\n\nAir Quality Control? What about the Rest of the World?\n\nThe main reason is that people are still generally undecided on what to believe in. The gravity of the situation the world is in seems to be misunderstood by many. Even in the United States itself, with all their programs, laws, and technology at the disposal, are not tackling the problem with full capacity because even their government is divided on the issue.\n\nLike the United States, countries address the problem of air pollution differently, and with different degrees of commitment. Also like the States, the public in general is not fully aware of the consequences, the facts, and the available alternatives that can help alleviate air pollution and restore the environment to what it once was.\n\nIn Canada for example, the Canadian Council of Ministers for the Environment act like a governing body that sets standards for air quality. With these standards come so many limitations. These only apply to states with more than 100,000 people, and no harsh penalties or punishments are given for non-compliance.\n\nRevisions have been proposed as of late, to address the problem more effectively and go beyond merely informing the public. Specific measures to decrease smog pollution and greenhouse gasses have been taken by political figures and government organizations alike.\n\nThe United Kingdom back then was not much different. In response to the Great Smog of 1952, where thick smog covered London from December five to December 9 in 1952, the Clean Air Act of 1956 and of 1968 was established. In these acts, zones where legislated to have smokeless fuels burnt at the said sites only, and power stations to be relocated in rural areas. The Clean Air Act of 1968 mainly focused on the use of tall chimneys to disperse smoke and other pollutants in burning coal, liquid, or other kinds of fuels.\n\nRecently however, the task has been assigned to local government agents. They have established a kind of air quality system that keeps track of the levels of air pollutants in their atmosphere. A monitoring system compares these values with the national air quality objectives, with the necessary adjustments implemented to reach said values.\n\nSummary\n\nThe problem of air pollution will not go away on its own. We cannot sit out the storm that is destroying our environment slowly, but more devastatingly as time goes on.\n\nAir pollution will not go away with the collective efforts of a minority, no matter how powerful, strong, and rich they are either. The atmosphere is affected and used by everyone\u2014no matter how clean and pollution-free your own country or space is, you are just as affected as you neighboring countries.\n\nIn the end, as evidenced by the above data and facts, it is neither about having the latest machines and technology, nor is it about having effective laws made \u2014 it all starts with understanding the facts, and having a common goal not just as a nation, but as a people saving the environment."}

Please contact us to take care of any of your needs.\n\nIndoor air quality is a hugely neglected issue when it comes to your lifestyle and comfort. Having the appropriate air filtration system working with your furnace and air conditioning can make a dramatic impact on you health and well being.\n\nIf you thought air pollution was just an outdoor concern, think again. The particles you see in a beam of afternoon sunlight streaming through the window only represent about 1% of the millions of airborne contaminants in your indoor air. Most standard fiber glass-mesh furnace filters only trap about 15% of these particles, leaving the other 85% to pollute your air, your furnishings, even your lungs.\n\nHaley Mechanical services both traditional air conditioners as well as air conditioner heat pumps, so no matter which model you have, we're here to help. We can install central air conditioning using your existing forced air ductwork, or provide a complete installation from scratch. Haley's will ensure that your new central air conditioner is the right size for your space, and that the ducts are also appropriately sized for your room, home or business.\n\nWhy does Indoor Air Quality matter?\n\nConsider the facts about indoor Air Quality:\n\nAccording to the American Lung Association, elements within our home and workplaces have been increasingly recognized as threats to our respiratory health. The most common pollutants are radon, combustion products, biologicals (molds, pet dander, pollen), volatile organic compounds, lead dust and asbestos.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency lists poor indoor air quality as the fourth largest environmental threat to our country.\n\nThere are an estimated 42.6 million Americans living with hay fever and\/or asthma. Learning how to control a home's environment to reduce allergen levels is important for managing allergies and asthma. Individuals who suffer from asthma, or have other respiratory illness may potentially be at a greater risk for health complications associated with poor air quality in their homes.\n\nAsthma is a serious chronic respiratory disease that affects people of all ages. The number of people in Minnesota and nationwide with asthma has risen during the past two decades.\n\nIn the house, poor indoor air quality can result in structural rot within the walls and attic and around window framing from excess moisture.\n\nCommon pollutants can enter our houses through air leaks in the structure.\n\nCommon housing problems or failures that occur in our homes include: musty odors and mold growth, window condensation, structural rot, peeling paint, back drafting appliances, damp basements and ice dams, or build-up of ice on the roof's edge, and high utility costs.\n\nAir Quality is important to your quality of life.

{"text":"Using mass spectrometry, which helps scientists pinpoint the exact compounds present in an air quality sample, researchers from the University of California Berkeley have created a set of sound clips -- some of which, with their otherworldly blip, glitch and drone tones could be at home on an ambient dub track -- describing the chemicals floating in the air at various locations in California.\n\nHere's what the air in the heavily trafficked Caldecott tunnel, which connects Oakland with Conta Costra County, sounds like. Hydrocarbons, spat out of tailpipes, are responsible for the tones that characterize this clip.\n\nIn contrast, this is the soundtrack from a pine forest in the Sierra Mountains. The sounds in the beginning, which the researchers describe as \"bubbly,\" indicate the presence of volatile organic compounds, which trees produce to attract helpful insects and ward off pests. The sounds of emissions, blown up from Sacramento, make an appearance toward the end of the clip.\n\nTo find out more about the project, I interviewed Gabriel Isaacman, a graduate student with the research group that created the air quality sound files. Our conversation took place over email since he is in China for a conference\n\nHigh country News: Air quality data is not usually something one can hear. Why did you decide to turn this data into sound?\n\nIsaacman: It's very important to explore and present data in new ways. Air quality is a subject we talk about a lot, especially in California, but most people don't typically think too much about the science behind it or how we know what we know. Furthermore, most people, even those interested in science, will never have the opportunity to work with data or maybe even step foot in a lab, so I wanted to bring this data to the public in a way that is interesting and accessible. Making science more hands-on, or in this case ears-on, helps engage people and hopefully inspires people to learn more or maybe pursue it a bit deeper.\n\nHCN: The sounds of pollutants like hydrocarbons from tailpipe emissions seem darker than the sounds assigned to natural chemicals given off from pine trees in the Sierras. How did you choose which sounds to assign to different chemicals?\n\nIsaacman: It's interesting to me that that is the case, because the tones were actually not assigned subjectively at all. I directly assigned tones based on the data. The way these files were made is that samples of air were collected on filters, and then analyzed in our lab using some advanced tools to separate all the compounds. What comes out of our instruments is information about the compounds in the (air). We identify (the compounds using a mass spectrometor and they are assigned) a set of identifying numbers, more-or-less unique for each compound. Compounds that fall apart more in our instrument end up with lower numbers.\n\nI calculated a tone based on the numbers in this mass spectrum, approximately spanning the range of a standard piano. (The compounds get assigned) numbers in the range of (approximately) 30-500, and I mathematically turned these into frequencies from the range of human hearing. Compounds that have lower numbers identifying them happen to be hydrocarbons, making low chords, while the oxygenated compounds we measure in more remote environments tend to be higher and more diverse, leading to an interesting combination of drones and 'plinks.'\n\nHCN: In a recent article for the Atlantic, you and the writer Aaron Reuben mention that there are inaccuracies in air pollution models, chiefly due to the interaction of human-caused and natural emissions. How do these interactions lead to inaccuracies in pollution models?\n\nIsaacman: Particulate matter, in general, is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate models, and it turns out we have historically not been great at modeling it, usually drastically underestimating the amount of particulate matter out there. As our field has gotten more advanced, of course, our models have gotten better, so more and more we are able to predict the amount of particulate matter. But often our predictions of its chemical properties then suffer, which is an important aspect in understanding climate and health impacts.\n\nThere is some evidence that a majority of particulate matter actually comes from chemical interactions between human and natural emissions, but we still have limited knowledge about this chemistry. Some evidence suggests human emissions increase formation of particulate matter from forest emissions, but it is still an area of active research.\n\n...\n\nEvery type of emission, (from) pine trees, diesel vehicles, meat cooking etc., releases a unique combination of compounds that give it its unique smell, so in a sense what we are trying to do is not to (simply) hear the differences, but to smell the differences between different particulate matter. A detailed understanding of the compounds in the particles gives us an idea of where they came from and how they were formed. Investigating this through sound gives us a new way to think about the data"}

They are most frequently used in homes and offices and helpful to people who suffer from allergies, asthma, chemical sensitivity and other respiratory related symptoms.\n\nHow does an air purifier work?\n\nAn air purifier draws polluted air from a given space into the unit and passes it through several layers of filtering devices. Particles, allergens and contaminates are trapped onto a filter and the clean or purified air is then recycled back into the room.\n\nWhy do I need an air purifier?\n\nAn air purifier will improve the overall indoor air quality and, in turn, improve your health. We tend to associate air pollution only with outdoor air, however the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that indoor air pollution levels can be as many as 2-5 times higher than outdoor pollutant levels. In fact, indoor air pollution is one of the top environmental concerns in the country. Many of the pollutants removed by air purifiers are known to trigger allergies and asthma; therefore an air purifier will offer relief to those suffering and lessen the possibility of a person contracting them if they don't already suffer from them. Infants and small children are especially susceptible to contracting asthma and allergies since they spend a majority of their time indoors.\n\nWhat contributes to poor indoor air quality?\n\nModern homes are built and sealed to be energy efficient and to hold air inside. While this is great for reducing your energy bills, it doesn't allow the home to breathe properly. Pollutants such as pollen, mold, dust, pet dander and tobacco smoke then become trapped in the home instead of being released outside through natural means.\n\nHow do I know what air purifier I need?\n\nAir purifiers can vary in their effectiveness based on different problems, so you should first determine what problem you are trying to solve. Some air purifiers are better at removing particles, while others are better at getting rid of odor or removing chemicals. Once you've determined the problem, determine the best technology and choose the right model for the room size. If you have asthma or morning congestion, you would want to look at purchasing a HEPA air purifier, especially one to keep in the bedroom. If you have a moldy basement, you would require an air purifier than can remove both airborne mold spores as well as musky odors. If you have a smoker in the house, you would need an air purifier with lots of activated carbon. If your home has indoor pets, you'll need an air purifier that can get the pet dander. If you have no specific purpose other than air cleaning, then any of our air purifiers will work for you.\n\nAre air purifiers loud?\n\nAir purifiers are comparable to the sound of a house fan. Most air purifiers have multiple speeds, with the highest setting generally equal to the level of normal conversation. In most instances, you would only use the high setting for a quick cleaning, then turn to medium or low in order to maintain the clean air levels. The medium and low settings are usually no louder than central heating or air conditioning and similar to white noise, which is beneficial for concentration, relaxation and better sleeping.\n\nHow often should I run my air purifier?\n\nFor optimum operation, all air purifiers should be run continuously. When the air purifier is turned off, indoor air pollution returns to its pre-treatment state.\n\nWhere should I put my air purifier?\n\nNaturally, it's best to place the air purifier in the room where you spend the most time. For most people, this is the bedroom. If you're allergic to pet dander then you may want to keep your air purifier in the room where your pets spend the most time. Also, you should not place an air purifier in the corner of a room, it should be placed at least a couple of feet away from the walls for maximum air flow.\n\nCan I open my windows in a room where an air purifier is running?\n\nYes, it is perfectly fine to mix in a little fresh air while the air purifier is working.\n\nWill an air purifier clean my whole house?\n\nThere are air cleaning systems available that can be installed to clean your entire house. However, they tend to be more expensive than a portable unit, and if an installed system is a budget constraint, portable air purifiers in key rooms is the way to go.\n\nHow do I know if my air purifier is working?\n\nAfter just a few days of installing your air purifier, the room will be cleaner and no longer feel heavy. You should be able to breathe easier and morning congestion, as well as allergy symptoms, should be lessened. When you change your filter, you will visually see how dirty it has become.\n\nHow much does it cost to operate an air purifier?\n\nThere are two factors you need to take into consideration: the cost of replacement filters and the annual electricity cost. High quality air purifiers generally use minimal electricity as they are engineered to be energy-saving. You can determine the annual operating cost by adding up the annual electricity cost and the filter replacement cost.\n\nAre there side effects to an air purifier?\n\nQuality, non-ozone producing air purifiers improve health and pose no side effects.\n\nWhat is the difference between ozone and negative ions?\n\nOzone is a harmful gas that can affect your health. Negative ions are believed to alleviate depression, boost our daytime energy and relieve stress by producing biochemical reactions that increase levels of serotonin.\n\nWhat is a CADR rating?\n\nClean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is the measurement for the volume of filtered air delivered by an air purifier. It is given in three measurements: one for pollen, one for tobacco smoke and one for dust. The higher the CADR number, the faster the unit filters the air.\n\nWhat is the best air purifier for someone with asthma?\n\nHEPA air purifiers are best for customers who suffer from asthma. Asthma sufferers should avoid ozone generators and ionic air cleaners.\n\nWill an air purifier cure my asthma or allergies?\n\nWhile an air purifier will lessen the effects that airborne pollutants have on your health and give allergy and asthma sufferers much needed relief from the symptoms, it will not cure them.\n\nWhat is a HEPA filter?\n\nHEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air and is type of highly efficient filtration media that removes microscopic particles from air passing through the filter. HEPA is a standard given to filters that remove at least 99.97% of all particles larger than 0.3 microns.\n\nWhat is the HEPA filter made of and how does it work?\n\nHEPA is a paper-like material made of densely spaced glass fiber. A washable pre-filter traps all larger particles then the HEPA filter removes at least 99.97% of all particles larger than 0.3 microns. Allergens such as pollen, pet dander, mold spores and dust get trapped in the dense fibers of the filter. Many HEPA air purifiers also contain a carbon filter to capture chemicals, odors and gases. Once the dirty air is purified, a fan sends it back into the room as clean air.\n\nHow often do I need to replace the filter?\n\nIf you are buying a HEPA air purifier, don't forget to check how much the replacement filters will cost. If your unit includes both a HEPA filter and a carbon filter or other combinations, they will most likely need to be replaced separately and may last for different periods of time. Generally pre-filters need to be changed every 4 to 5 months and HEPA filters every 2 to 4 years. Home environment factors such as indoor pets, tobacco smoke, a fireplace or someone with moderate or severe allergies or asthma can play a big role in how often the filters need to be replaced. Some brands have electronic indicators and others have a manufacturer designated time period that the filters should last.\n\nWhat is the outdoor Air Quality Index (AQI) and what do each of the colors mean?\n\nThe Air Quality Index is the system used to warn the public when the air pollution is dangerous. The AQI is divided into six color code categories and advice to go along with it:\n\nGlossary\n\nA\n\nActivated Carbon\n\nActivated Carbon is a highly absorbent powdered carbon that purifies by adsorption. It is made by burning carbon-based materials at very high temperatures to create a porous internal structure that provides a huge surface area that is ideal for removing odorous compounds and gases.\n\nAirborne\n\nAirborne refers to particles that float in the air. Air filters are used to catch these particles and clean the air.\n\nACH (Air Changes Per Hour)\n\nAir Changes Per Hour measures the amount of times an air purifier cleans and re-circulates all of the air in a given room during one hour. The more changes per hour the more effective the filter is.\n\nAir Purifier\n\nAn air purifier is a device that removes contaminants such as viruses, microscopic organisms, pet dander, dust and allergens from the air. Purifiers are especially beneficial to people who suffer from allergies and asthmatics. They also help to reduce and eliminate odors from pets, tobacco smoke, and gasses.\n\nAQI (Air Quality Index)\n\nThe AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. There are six categories each assigned a specific color to make it easier for people to understand the air pollution and associated health concerns for their community.\n\nAllergen\n\nAn allergen is a substance that causes an allergic reaction in a person's immune system. Although the list is long, the most common allergens are pet dander, smoke and pollen.\n\nB\n\nBacteria\n\nBacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that have no easily identifiable nucleus and inhabit virtually all environments. While some bacteria can be harmful, most types are harmless to humans and many can even be beneficial.\n\nBiohazard\n\nA biohazard describes biological waste that is often contaminated in some way.\n\nC\n\nClean Air Delivery Rate (CADR)\n\nThe CADR indicates the total volume of air that a specific air purifier cleans of a particular pollutant in one minute. CADR delivers test results for three main pollutants: tobacco smoke, pollen and dust. The higher the numbers, the faster the unit filters the air.\n\nCleanroom\n\nCleanrooms are environments that have a low level of environmental pollutants. They are 10,000 times cleaner than a hospital operating room and are often used for scientific research and manufacturing. Air entering a cleanroom from outside is filtered to exclude dust and the air inside is constantly re-circulated through HEPA filters at about 10 times per minute to remove internally-generated contaminants.\n\nCFM (Cubic Feet Per Minute)\n\nCubic Feet per Minute measures how much air passes through a stationary point in one minute. A higher CFM means that the air passes through the air purifier at a higher rate.\n\nE\n\nEnergy Star\n\nEnergy Star is a program that was developed in 1992 by the EPA to identify and promote products that are energy efficient. Devices carrying the Energy Star rating are generally 20-30% more efficient than non-rated models, which save the consumer money and help protect the environment.\n\nEPA (Environmental Protection Agency)\n\nThe EPA, an acronym for the US Environmental Protection Agency, is responsible for implementing laws that promote public health by protecting our air, water and soil from harmful pollution.\n\nH\n\nHEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air)\n\nHEPA is the acronym for high efficiency particulate air. It is a type of air filter that must meet the standard of trapping at least 99.97 percent of all particles larger than 0.3 microns. A HEPA filter is widely regarded as the ultimate filter.\n\nI\n\nIndoor Pollution\n\nIndoor air pollution describes the contaminants inside of a building. It is often ignored, but can actually be worse than outdoor air pollution due to poor ventilation. Sources of indoor pollution include tobacco smoke, pet dander, dust mites, mold, pollen, pesticides and gases such as radon and carbon monoxide.\n\nIAQ (Indoor Air Quality)\n\nIndoor Air Quality (IAQ) is a term referring to the air quality within a confined space, especially as it relates to the health and comfort of the occupants. It can be affected by such things as mold, bacteria and gases and is becoming an increasingly concerning health hazard than outdoor air. The IAQ is measured according to guidelines set by the government and is used to measure the efficiency of air purification and filtration systems.\n\nIonizers\n\nIonizers use high voltage electricity to electrically charge air molecules and create negative electrons. The negative ions charge small particles that clump together and become too heavy to remain airborne, and the particles end up sticking to any surface available. This process often creates ozone as a dangerous byproduct.\n\nM\n\nMold\n\nMolds are microscopic organisms that are present virtually everywhere. They aid in the breakdown of dead material and recycle nutrients in the environment. Mold will grow and multiply with sufficient moisture. It can be a concern in the home and exposure can cause health effects.\n\nMCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity)\n\nMultiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) is an unusually severe sensitivity to many different pollutants including solvents, VOCs, perfumes, diesel, smoke and chemicals in general. MCS is different from true allergies because it has no known cause and its processes are not fully understood. Studies show that MCS is more common in women than men and most often in younger adults between the ages of 30 and 50.\n\nN\n\nNegative Ion\n\nNegative ions are invisible molecules that are odorless and tasteless. We inhale them in abundance while in certain environments such as mountains, waterfalls and beaches. They are believed to produce biochemical reactions that help alleviate depression, relieve stress and boost our energy. Unfortunately modern homes and offices seal out negative ions and most appliances and modern building materials produce an excess of positive ions which contribute to decreased energy, fatigue and depression. Negative ions work to clean the air by attaching to positively charged particles and weighing them down, until they drop out of the air.\n\nNatural Ventilation\n\nNatural ventilation is the process of supplying and removing outdoor air through an indoor space by natural means such as windows, doors and cracks in the home.\n\nNegative Pressure\n\nNegative pressure is a condition that exists when less an enclosed area has lower pressure than the area surrounding it.\n\nO\n\nOzone\n\nOzone (O3) is a tri-atomic molecule that consists of three oxygen atoms. It is highly unstable and reacts with airborne particles by launching the third oxygen atom at anything near it. When this oxygen atom reacts with the airborne particle, a tiny explosion occurs and destroys the particle. Ozone purifiers are highly effective against both dust and microscopic organisms, but can be unhealthy when exposed to large quantities.\n\nOff-Gassing\n\nOff-Gassing is the evaporation of volatile chemicals in non-metallic materials at normal atmospheric pressure. Materials such as paints, stains, and varnishes can produce significant off-gassing in your home or office. The off-gassing of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) seriously affect the quality of air indoors.\n\nP\n\nPet Dander\n\nPet dander is a collection of tiny scales of an animal's dead skin that is shed. Pet dander can float in the air for a long time before sticking to a surface, allowing it to be spread widely around a home.\n\nV\n\nVOC (Volatile Organic Compounds)\n\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are gases emitted by a wide range of products found around the home such as paints and lacquers, cleaning supplies, pesticides and building materials, office equipment such as copiers and printers, correction fluids and carbonless copy paper, graphics and craft materials including glues and adhesives, permanent markers, and photographic solutions. Pollution indoors can be up to five times worse than pollution outdoors, due to high levels of VOCs.\n\nAir Purifier Technology\n\nHEPA Technology\n\nHigh Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) is a technology that is used to filter particles. All HEPA filters must meet a rigorous standard of trapping at least 99.97% of all particles larger than 0.3 microns. These particles caught in the HEPA filter, such as bacteria and viruses, cannot be seen by the human eye as visible particles are larger than 10 microns. These filters are able to trap mold and bacteria and do not generate ozone or harmful byproducts, so they create a more sanitary environment.\n\nHEPA filters are made of a very fine fiber-like material that has been folded back and forth to create the shape of an accordion. This accordion-like shape creates a maze of randomly arranged fibers and presents a very large surface for air to be pushed through by the air purifier fan. Airflow must have an opportunity to pass through the filter in order for it to be cleaned. The more times airflow passes through the filter, the cleaner the air will become. As the HEPA filter becomes full, air flow will no longer be able to pass through and a new filter will be needed; however a HEPA filter will typically last 2-4 years.\n\nLarge particles will not be able to pass through the openings of the fibers and will immediately be caught in the filter. Smaller particles will get caught by one of three processes. The first is when particles come within one radius of a fiber and stick to it, which is called interception. The second process, called impaction, is when larger particles collide with fibers and embed into them. Finally, the smallest particles get caught by a process called diffusion, which is when those particles collide with gas molecules.\n\nHEPA air purifier filters are the most effective at trapping airborne particles; however they do not remove odors, chemicals or gasses. Therefore, most HEPA air purifiers have some level of activated carbon based material to absorb odors and chemicals not caught by the HEPA filter.\n\nActivated Carbon Technology\n\nActivated carbon is a form of carbon that has been processed to be extremely porous and to give it a large surface area for adsorption. They are comprised of many molecular sized pores that have high adsorbent ability and chemical bonding. These properties make them a very effective tool for capturing pollutants such as chemical emissions, gasses, tobacco smoke, and odors. Once these pollutants are captured, they are not released back into the air, which helps to eliminate air recontamination.\n\nAir purifiers with activated carbon filters are particularly helpful to people with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), because they absorb formaldehyde which can be found in carpet, wood paneling, and furniture upholstery. Perfumes \u2013 as well as chemicals in household cleaning items \u2013 are also removed to make the environment much more breathable, especially for asthma sufferers, babies, children, and the elderly.\n\nFor many people, particulates such as dust, pollen or pet dander are the main irritants, with odor and chemical adsorption being less important. For those who need a high degree of both, it is best to look at the higher caliber room air purifiers which offer outstanding particle, odor and chemical removal. VOCs (volatile organic compounds), smog, ozone, fumes from cooking, pets, or tobacco can be unhealthy or irritating for anyone, and not just for those who suffer from allergies and asthma.\n\nCarbon air filters help a great deal in reducing the contamination of the air in our rooms; however they do have a lower efficiency level in removing allergens and airborne particles. They also have limitations in eliminating contaminants that are far away and not forced through the filter.\n\nElectronic Technology\n\nElectronic air purifiers use an advanced and effective type of technology to absorb contaminants in the air. The process used to trap charged particles is called electrostatic attraction, and it is utilized when air is drawn through an ionization section where particles obtain an electrical charge. These charged particles then accumulate on an oppositely-charged collector instead of staying airborne. This is an effective cleaning method because charged particles stick better than those that are merely absorbed, and it is because of this that electronic air purifiers are at least 95% effective at picking up contaminants in the air.\n\nElectronic air purifiers use either a one- or two-stage system to remove airborne particles. Both systems are equally effective and require very low maintenance. In a one-stage system, the particles are charged as they enter the purifier and they stick to the collector. As air enters a two stage system, the particles are charged using high voltage wires, then the charged particles stick to an oppositely-charged collector. Electronic air purifiers have no filters to change and only require you to wipe down the collector with a damp cloth as build up develops. This will keep your air purifier running effectively and efficiently.\n\nElectronic air purifiers use a technology that makes them one of the most effective types on the market for removing odors, gases and particles from the air. Their effectiveness combined with their low maintenance make them a popular and convenient way to clean the air.\n\nUV Technology\n\nUV technology is most often used in conjunction with particulate filter systems since it doesn't really get rid of airborne particles. It is however, an excellent method to kill germs such as bacteria and viruses. Air purifiers using this technology have a UV lamp installed, and as microorganisms pass by the UV rays radiated from the lamp, cellular or genetic damage aids in destroying the microorganism.\n\nA UV air purifier can convert molecules of oxygen and water found in your air into ozone and hydroxyl. The active molecules react with the air pollutants and destroy them into harmless components like water and carbon dioxide. Ozone is not needed for cleaning and, since it can be a harmful pollutant, a good UV air purifier should minimize or eliminate ozone. The effectiveness of a UV air purifier is dependent upon the wattage of the light and the time of exposure to the light. UV air purifiers do not have filters unless combined with a filter system, and the UV lamp should be monitored and replaced according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nAlthough UV technology is effective at killing viruses and bacteria, it is best used with a filter system ahead of the lamps. Without a filter system, too many microorganisms get shaded from the light by particulates. Therefore, most air purifiers that employ UV start by filtering the air with HEPA and activated carbon and use the UV as a final stage of filtration.\n\nNegative Ion\n\nNegative ion air purifiers manually create negative ions to help clean the air. This is done by taking oxygen atoms and chemically injecting them with an electron. These atoms then magnetically attract enough airborne particles (like pollen and dust) to become too heavy to remain airborne. Because of this, the particles drop and attach themselves to other solid items in the room, such as walls or windows.\n\nWhile this technology may seem advanced, it has proven to be less effective than other air purifier technologies. Negative ion purifiers merely mask the polluted air as opposed to actually cleaning it, because they do not have the ability to absorb or dispose of the harmful containments in the air. When they are stuck to walls and other surfaces, they have the ability to become loose and re-circulate themselves back into the air. Therefore, the negative ion air purifier has not cleaned and eliminated these particles, but has instead let them sit in other places waiting for a chance to re-contaminate the air.\n\nOzone\n\nOzone air purifiers intentionally produce gas ozone to inhibit the growth of biological agents. However, many health professionals have refuted the claims that these ozone air purifiers are safe and effective, and no government agency has approved these devices for use. Exposure to ozone is claimed to ignite asthma symptoms, while a high exposure level can eventually scar the lungs.\n\nMany brands of ozone air purifiers exist on the market, each of them varied in the amounts of ozone they produce. Many of the chemicals found in indoor environments can take months or years to be depleted by ozone, making the reaction time virtually nonexistent and the purifier ineffective. In addition, ozone does not remove particles such as dust and pollen, so many purifiers also include negative ion technology, which proves to just mask the air instead of clean it. Ozone air purifiers are unlikely to fully clean the air unless the concentrations were significantly higher than public health standards"}
{"text":"Automobile emissions control\n\nAutomobile emissions control covers all the technologies that are employed to reduce the air pollution-causing emissions produced by automobiles. Exhaust emissions control systems were first required on 1966 model year vehicles produced for sale in the state of California, followed by the United States as a whole in model year 1968, although the overall reduction in pollution has been much slower.\nThe emissions produced by a vehicle fall into these basic categories:\n\nTailpipe emissions: This is what most people think of when they think of vehicle air pollution; the products of burning fuel in the vehicle's engine, emitted from the vehicle's exhaust system. The major pollutants emitted include:\n\nHydrocarbons: this class is made up of unburned or partially burned fuel, and is a major contributor to urban smog, as well as being toxic. They can cause liver damage and even cancer.\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOx): These are generated when nitrogen in the air reacts with oxygen under the high temperature and pressure conditions inside the engine. NOx emissions contribute to both smog and acid rain.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO): a product of incomplete combustion, carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen and is dangerous to people with heart disease.\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2): Emissions of carbon dioxide are an increasing concern as its role in global warming as a greenhouse gas has become more apparent.\n\nIncreasing engine efficiency\n\nIncreasing vehicle efficiency\n\nContributions to the goal of reducing fuel consumption and related emissions come from\n\nlightweight vehicle design\n\nminimized air resistance\n\nreduced rolling resistance\n\nimproved powertrain efficiency\n\nincreasing spark to the spark plug (this topic should be under the ignition system)\n\nregenerative braking\n\nEach of these items breaks down into a number of factors.\n\nIncreasing driving efficiency\n\nSignificant reduction of emissions come from\n\ndriving technique (some 10-30% reduction)\n\nunobstructed traffic conditions\n\ncruising at an optimum speed for the vehicle\n\nreducing the number of cold starts\n\nCleaning up the emissions\n\nAdvances in engine and vehicle technology continually reduce the amount of pollutants generated, but this is generally considered insufficient to meet emissions goals. Therefore, technologies to react with and clean up the remaining emissions have long been an essential part of emissions control.\n\nAir injection\n\nA very early emissions control system, the Air injection reactor (AIR) reduces the products of incomplete combustion (hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide) by injecting fresh air into the exhaust manifolds of the engine. In the presence of this oxygen-laden air, further combustion occurs in the manifold and exhaust pipe. Generally the air is delivered through an engine-driven 'smog pump' and air tubing to the manifolds.\n\nExhaust Gas Recirculation\n\nMany engines produced after the 1973 model year have an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve between the exhaust and intake manifolds; its sole purpose is to reduce NOx emissions by introducing a metered, and quite small amount of inert gas into the air\/fuel mixture, lowering peak combustion temperatures. In the case of EGR, the exhaust gasses are inert enough to serve this purpose.\n\nCatalytic converters\n\nThe catalytic converter is a device, placed in the exhaust pipe, which converts various emissions into less harmful ones using, generally, a combination of platinum, palladium and rhodium as catalysts. They make for a significant, and easily applied, method for reducing tailpipe emissions. Catalytic converters are damaged when used on engines that burn leaded fuels. Unleaded fuels were marketed in 1973 and by 1996 leaded fuels were banned completely for on-road use in the USA.\n\nEvaporative emissions control\n\nEfforts at the reduction of evaporative emissions include the capturing of vented vapors from within the vehicle, and the reduction of refuelling emissions.\n\nCapturing vented vapors\n\nWithin the vehicle, vapors from the fuel tank are channelled through canisters containing activated carbon instead of being vented to the atmosphere. These are known as carbon canisters. The vapors are adsorbed within the canister, which feeds into the inlet manifold of the engine.\n\nEmission Testing\n\nIn 1966, the first emission test cycle was enacted in the State of California measuring tailpipe emissions in PPM (parts per million).\nThe Environmental Working Group used California ASM emissions data to create an Auto Asthma Index that rates vehicle models based on emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, the chemicals that create smog.\n\nSome cities are also using a technology developed by Dr. Stedman,of University of Denver which uses lasers to detect emissions while vehicles pass by on public roads, thus eliminating the need for owners to go to a test center. Stedman's laser detection of exhaust gases is commonly used in metropolitan areas."}
{"text":"Europe clears the air\n\nSatellite measurements show that nitrogen dioxide in the lower atmosphere over parts of Europe and the US has fallen over the past decade. More than 15 years of atmospheric observations have revealed trends in air quality.\n\nAs the world's population increases, economies in many countries are also growing and populations are concentrating in large cities. With the use of fossil fuels still on the rise, pollution in large cities is also increasing.\nNitrogen dioxide is an important pollutant in the troposphere, the lowest portion of our atmosphere.\n\nSatellite observations of it began with the launch of the ERS-2 satellite in 1995 and its GOME instrument, originally designed for monitoring atmospheric ozone.\n\nMonitoring continued with the Sciamachy sensor on Envisat, OMI on NASA's Aura and GOME-2 on Eumetsat's MetOp.\n\nThis set of instruments shows, that over the years, nitrogen dioxide levels have decreased in the US and Europe, but increased in the Middle East and parts of Asia.\n\n\"The changes observed from space can be explained by two effects: increased use of fossil fuels in evolving economies, leading to increased pollution and improvements in technology \u2013 like cleaner cars \u2013 leading to reduced pollution,\" explained Andreas Richter, a scientist with the Institute of Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen in Germany.\n\n\"These changes in pollution levels are surprisingly rapid, and satellites are the only way to monitor them globally.\n\n\"For this, the long-term availability of satellite instruments that can monitor pollution is of key importance.\"\n\nIn the US, urban areas in the state of California showed a consistent drop in nitrogen dioxide.\n\n\"Airborne and ground-based measurements supported the findings from the satellite data,\" said Si-Wan Kim from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n\"The satellite measurements are now being used to improve the emission inventory in California"}
{"text":"Carbon Monoxide Safety\n\nCarbon Monoxide gas has no taste, no smell and no colour and is highly poisonous. The fatal effects of Carbon Monoxide along with our inability to detect its prescence makes it incredibly dangerous. Even when exposed to low levels of Carbon Monoxide, there can be lasting effects.\n\nWhere does Carbon Monoxide come from?\n\nCarbon Monoxide can come from any appliance which burns gas, oil, coal or wood, such as:\n\nGas or Oil Boilers\n\nGas Cookers\n\nGas or Coal Fires\n\nPortable Heaters\n\nWood Burners\n\nYour boiler works by burning a mixture of fuel and air, and this burning heats your water which will be used in the radiators and the hot water taps.\n\nEven boilers whic are set up correctly will still emit Carbon Monoxide which could find it's way into your house.\n\nSymptons of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning\n\nSymptons of Carbon Monoxide poisoning can be similar to these of the flu, or even a hangover. The efects may include:\n\nHeadaches\n\nNausea\n\nGeneral Lethargy\n\nDizziness\n\nOther Flu-Like Symptons\n\nCheck out the how the below levels of Carbon Monoxide will effect you:\n\n100ppm - you will get a headache after being exposed to this level for 2-3 hours\n\n200ppm - you'll have a headache, feel dizzy and sick, and quite lethargic after 2-3 hours of exposure\n\n400ppm - the headaches and nausea will set in after 1-2 hours, and death can occur after 3 hours\n\n800ppm - bad headaches, dizziness, bad convulsions up to 45 minutes of exposure, death can occur in 2-3 hours\n\n1,600ppm - headaches, dizziness, nausea within 20 minutes, and the potential to collapse, with death occuring in 1-2 hours\n\nYour body and organs need Oxygen in order to function correctly, but if you breath in CO, your body does not get the required Oxygen. The effect of this is your organs and muscles don't get the required amount of Oxygen, and can become damaged. With CO affecting your muscles and brain, by the time you recognize the symptoms of CO poisoning, you may not have the energy to escape the room.\n\nWhat Gas & Controls Offer\n\nWe stock a large quantity of various Carbon Monoxide CO alarms in Northern Ireland. Our alarms are manufactured by Honeywell, and we have 2 main types for domestic applications.\n\nHoneywell H450EN - this unit is perfect for domestic use. It is cheap, reliable and easy to install. It comes with up to 7 years life, and a 6 year warranty. We offer these with quantity discount and next day delivery.\n\nHoneywell SF340F - this unit offers the added protection of a built in relay to connect a gas solenoid valve. Once this detector sensors Carbon Monoxide, it will close the solenoid valve, preventing more gas from entering the building or house. Once the Carbon Monoxide clears, it opens the valve again, allowing your heaters\/cooking appliances to come back on. While being more expensive than the H450EN, the SF340F offers greater protection. We stock large quantities of these Carbon Monoxide alarm in Northern Ireland.\n\nEven with Carbon Monoxide alarms installed, allows read your appliances' manufacturers guidelines that come with the appliance.

{"text":"The purpose of this bulletin is to alert field personnel to the potential carcinogenicity of whole diesel exhaust and to enumerate the specific gaseous and particulate components that comprise the emission from diesel engines.\n\nRecent animal studies in rats and mice confirm an association between the induction of cancer and exposure to whole diesel exhaust. The lung is the primary site identified with carcinogenic or tumorigenic responses following inhalation\nexposure. Limited epidemiologic evidence suggests an association between occupational exposure to diesel engine emissions and lung cancer. The consistency of these toxicologic and epidemiologic findings suggest that a potential\noccupational carcinogenic hazard exists in human exposure to diesel exhaust.\n\nNIOSH estimates that approximately 1.35 million workers are occupationally exposed to the combustion products of diesel fuel in approximately 80,000 workplaces in the United States (NIOSH 1983). Workers who are likely to be exposed\nto diesel emissions include mine workers, bridge and tunnel workers, railroad workers, loading dock workers, truck drivers, fork-lift drivers, farm workers, and auto, truck, and bus maintenance garage workers.\n\nParticulates (soot) in diesel exhaust are composed of solid carbon cores that are produced during the combustion process and that tend to form chain or cluster aggregates. As much of 15% to 65% of the mass of particulate emissions\n(soot) of diesel engines is made up of organic compounds absorbed onto the surface of the particulates. Among these compounds is a group of compounds known as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons( PAHs), several of which are carcinogens\n(IARC 1983).\n\nPermissible exposure limits (PELs) established by OSHA and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for some gases typically found in diesel exhaust are listed in Table 1 along with the recommended exposure limits (RELs)\nestablished by NIOSH.\n\nOSHA, MSHA, and NIOSH exposure limits relevant to the particulate fraction of diesel engine emissions are listed in Table 2. Because diesel emission particulates are of respirable size, the presence of diesel equipment contributes\nto the total burden of respirable dust present in an occupational environment. Existing limits for occupational exposures to other respirable dust also limit exposure to the particulate fraction of diesel emissions.\n\nAlthough no specific recommendations are being made from a compliance standpoint, compliance officers should be aware of the various components of diesel exhaust as this knowledge may aid in evaluating a worker's exposures or the\nenvironment in which he or she works.\n\nPlease disseminate this bulletin to all Area Offices, State Plan States and Consultation Project Officers."}
{"text":"\"Doctors too need education\"\n\n0 Comments\n\nIssue Date: Jan 15, 1998\n\nDr S K Chabbra, reader and head of the department of cardiorespiratory physiology, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, New Delhi, is among the few doctors to conduct an epidemiological study relating air pollution to respiratory morbidity among adults and children in Delhi. In an interview to Priti Kumar, he spoke about the role of doctors in educating the people about health hazards due to pollution\n\nOn the results of the study on childhood asthma among Delhi children:\nThe preliminary results show that nearly 16 per cent of the children, in the age group of five-16 years, suffer from asthma. If we add old asthma cases - those who had asthma in the past but do not have it now -- the prevalence is around 19-20 per cent. We have selected some 15,000 children from different schools in east, west, south, and central Delhi. Standardised questionnaires were given to the children and were answered by their parents. We carried out examination of selected children for the lung function testing to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nOn the results of the ongoing study relating air pollution to respiratory morbidity among adults in Delhi:\nThe results have not yet been analysed in detail. Air pollution may not be the only cause for respiratory morbidity. Other aspects like the type of fuel, cigarette smoking, general economic levels and proximity to industries have to be considered before arriving at any conclusion.\n\nOn how the respiratory morbidity study is being carried out:\nThe study has been undertaken exclusively for adults residing in Delhi for more than 10 years. We have selected people residing in selected areas of Delhi where there are permanent air quality monitoring stations. We are comparing different areas of Delhi, that we know differ in air quality. We then try to see if differences in the respiratory health of the selected persons can be explained with respect to the air quality. The health status of different segments of the population is compared. We are also measuring the lung function and estimating the appearance of chronic respiratory symptoms like chronic cough (persistence of cough for more than three months in a year), chronic production of phlegm and sputum, breathlessness, and wheezing, that are characteristics of asthma.\n\nWe are measuring what proportion of each of these segments is suffering from either of these symptoms. So this will give us an idea of the total respiratory morbidity, the prevalence of symptoms, the types of respiratory diseases, and the lung function status.\n\nOn whether any recommendations, based on this study, are being furnished to the ministry of health and family welfare or the Indian Council of Medical Research:\nNot yet. This is our first study and once it is over we will surely give some useful data to the health planners to work on.\n\nOn whether air pollution creates new asthmatics: A ir pollution does not create new asthmatics. However, it is known to increase the severity of asthma. In India, it is very difficult to say if the number of persons suffering from respiratory diseases has increased due to air pollution. There is no data to prove this as epidemiological studies have not been carried out in India. However, studies in the west have shown that the prevalence of childhood asthma among children in the us and the uk has increased from eight to nine per cent in the early 70s to the recent figure of 17 to 18 per cent. However, it must be noted that the air quality there, has improved over this period of time. Thus, if we are asked to explain the increase in asthma cases in the west, we can say that air pollution may not be responsible for it.\n\nOn the current levels of pollution in Delhi:\nThe Patel Chest Institute does not have the resources to measure the pollution levels. We are therefore, going by the data provided by the Central Pollution Control Board. According to their data, it is the suspended particulate matter that exceeds the permissible limit dangerously.\n\nOn whether lack of data on the link between air pollution and health is responsible for the apathy among doctors and people:\nWe don't need any data to prove that air pollution is bad for us. A lot of it is common sense. Doctors say that they cannot educate people as they lack the data. But, if they really want, they can still find a way out. Take the case of vehicular pollution. If people are aware that emissions from vehicles cause pollution which might affect their health, they will take care to keep their vehicles in proper condition. But they do not bother to do so. They do it only when they are forced by the police.\n\nOn doctors' role in informing people about effects of pollution:\nDoctors do have an important role to play as the patients will certainly listen to a doctor. But then, doctors come from the same society, where the level of awareness on these issues is extremely poor. Doctors too need education regarding this. It is my impression that people are not concerned about the effects of pollution. In fact, there is a general feeling among people that air pollution is not affecting them. They, however, agree that it might be affecting other people. Hence it is necessary to educate the doctors so that they can inform and educate their patients about it. Health education will play a key role in the efforts to solve the pollution problem. Pollution control cannot be effective just by enforcing a law. Motivation and education alone can help us to achieve the goal."}

{"text":"For\nmore than two decades, NIOSH has been at the forefront of research to\npromote healthy indoor working environments. This is one of our great\nsuccess stories in working with diverse partners to address complex occupational\nhealth concerns, and then translating our research findings into practical,\neffective recommendations for improving health, safety, and productivity.\n\nIn\none such pioneering effort in the early 1990s, NIOSH joined with the\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency in developing a guidebook to help\nbuilding owners and managers prevent, identify, and correct indoor air\nproblems; this manual, available on the web at \nis still widely used. More dramatically, results from scores of Health\nHazard Evaluations (HHEs) and other NIOSH research studies underpin much\nof today's\nscientific literature on remediating indoor environmental problems in offices,\nschools, government buildings, and other non-industrial workplaces.\n\nNIOSH's\nleadership was recognized again last month when Surgeon General Richard\nCarmona convened a two-day Surgeon General's Workshop on\nHealthy Indoor Environment on the campus of the National Institutes\nof Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. NIOSH researchers helped plan\nthe conference, participated in the Jan. 12-13 discussions on\nthe current priority research needs for improving the health of employees\nin indoor environments, and joined with other participants to suggest\nnext steps for ensuring healthier indoor environments for all Americans.\nThe Surgeon General's\nkeynote remarks are available at \n\nConcerns\nhave risen significantly over the past two decades in regard to chemical\noffgassing, mold, environmental tobacco smoke, and other indoor pollutants.\nAs Dr. Carmona noted in his remarks, one gauge of this trend can be\nfound in the requests that come to NIOSH for technical assistance under\nour Health Hazard Evaluation program. In just the past 25 years, the\npercentage of HHEs related to indoor-air quality has increased from\n0.5 percent of all evaluations in 1978, to 52 percent of all evaluations\nsince 1990. This means that in the past three decades, the evaluations\nrelated to air quality concerns have increased from one of every 200\nevaluations to one of every two.\n\nIn its formal workshop\npresentation, NIOSH identified several high priority research needs\nrelated to healthy indoor environments:\n\nCommunicable respiratory illnesses\nin indoor environments, such as influenza and the common cold.\n\nBuilding-related\nallergies and asthma.\n\nUnderstanding how the design, operation, and maintenance\nof buildings and the activities of occupants affect the concentration\nof indoor pollutants.\n\nIdentifying and evaluating strategies to reduce\nbarriers and increase incentives for health-protective building practices.\n\nThese\nneeds are very much reflected in our indoor environment research planning.\nWe are particularly pleased that several of our programs for bolstering\nresearch partnerships \u2013 including the National Occupational\nResearch Agenda (NORA), Research to Practice (r2p), and Steps to\na Healthier U.S. Workforce \u2013 offer promising avenues for designing and carrying\nout new collaborative studies in this area.

ESL is the juncture at which\ntime a toxic vapor will begin to penetrate a given filter, due to\nnormal degradation of the filter over time. OSHA, beginning in 1998,\nhas required employers to use ESL indicator devices that will alert\nusers to replace cartridges in time to prevent toxic exposures from\noccurring. Such devices are unavailable for organic-vapor cartridges,\nnecessitating the use of a predictive computer model as the next best\nthing.\n\nAlthough ESL models\nfor organic-vapor cartridges have been developed, they lacked an important\nfeature that the NIOSH model provides. This is the incorporation of\nrelative humidity into the various workplace factors (such as temperature,\npace of work, and contaminant levels) that affect the integrity and\nperformance of the filter. Humidity is a key factor, since it can reduce\nservice life by 80 percent. In the 12 months since the program was\nmade available in software form and uploaded to OSHA's Web site\nas a compliance assistance tool (along with a user-friendly video tutorial):\n\nThere have been\nmore than 3,000 visits to the OSHA Web site to view the video or\nto ask questions about the model.\n\nFive hundred copies\nof a compact disc (CD) containing the model and the training video\nhave been requested from NIOSH.\n\nMore information\non the product, including a list of the many partners that helped in\nits development, is available at \nAn updated version of the model will be released early this year, and\nNIOSH is developing a similar model for filter cartridges used against\nreactive gases.\n\nNORA\n\nThe\nNational Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) recently unveiled its newly\nredesigned newsletter, NORA News.

The quality of the air is something that cannot be ignored: as it may cause irritation of our airways or breathing difficulties and also contributes to the erosion of monuments. For these reasons Paris City Council makes every effort to bring a breath of fresh air to a city that still suffers from a surplus of traffic.\n\nSurveillance\n\nSince 1954, the air in Paris is being constantly monitored, a job entrusted since 1979 to the [AIRPARIF] organization, under the authorization of the Department for the Environment. The quality of the air is displayed on a daily basis on electronic boards throughout the city, on a scale from 1 (very good) to 10 (very poor) corresponding to international standards set down by the OMS and the European Commission.\n\nWhen levels of pollution are high, the population is alerted by the media.

{"text":"Document Actions\n\nBy 2009, NOAA researchers had pieced together circumstantial information about Wyoming's worsening winter ozone events. Ozone spiked when temperature inversions trapped and concentrated pollutants near the valley floor. Extensive snow cover made a difference, too: Sunlight reflecting off it created enough radiation, scientists theorized, to set off the reactions that create ozone. In winter 2010, startlingly high ozone levels were documented in Utah's Uintah Basin under similar conditions.\n\nIn both places, booming natural gas fields seemed the source of ozone's primary ingredients: nitrogen oxides from diesel trucks and engines that run compressors and other equipment; and volatile organic compounds, present in the gas itself.\n\nKnowing the source of emissions is enough to devise remedies for many pollution problems. Take sulfate particles, another contributor to smog. Power plants emit sulfur dioxide, which creates sulfate. When plants install scrubbers that capture most sulfur dioxide emissions, you get fewer sulfate particles in the air.\n\nOzone is much more complicated. \"It's a weird beast,\" says Leonard Herr, the Bureau of Land Management's air-quality specialist for Utah. \"You can't just control one thing.\" Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the basic building blocks, but you also need reactive atoms or molecules called free radicals -- created when sunlight reacts with things like nitrous acid, a byproduct of NOx, or ozone itself -- to jumpstart the process, the way a spark makes fire out of fuel. But there's no universal recipe; which free radicals react with which VOCs and NOx differs from region to region. Moreover, some environments are sensitive to NOx, meaning that if it's reduced, ozone will be too. Others are sensitive to VOCs. It's even possible to reduce NOx in a VOC sensitive environment, and end up slightly increasing ozone.\n\nSo managing ozone requires extraordinary prudence, plus a nuanced understanding of the chemistry that creates it in each locale. Neither Utah nor Wyoming has reached that level of understanding.\n\nThe NOAA team intended to change that. For six weeks last winter, they worked out of a sort of man camp in the heart of the gas field. A rental RV -- housing for grad students monitoring a balloon measuring pollution above the surface -- sat alongside trailers and what looked like miniature shipping containers, jammed with instruments measuring pollutants. Wind sensors helped the researchers see how plumes moved. And a team toured the field daily in the van, collecting real-time emissions data from each link of the production chain. If the chemists in the temporary labs could figure out which pollutants were the ozone conspirators, the van could help identify their origins.\n\nOnly two things were missing: snow and inversions. The scientists charged with unraveling the ozone riddle and recommending fixes found themselves in the ironic position of wishing for dirty days for the sake of science. But they never materialized. And so, there was no ozone to study.\n\n\"We're kind of stuck halfway right now,\" Roberts says. They did collect some information: They ruled out a nearby coal-fired power plant as a major contributor; although it spews plenty of NOx, its plume travels above the level of inversions. And they believe wintertime ozone has been seen only in the Utah and Wyoming basins because of the way topography restricts air movement during inversions. VOC emissions were found to be especially high from evaporation ponds and during flowback -- the period after a well is hydrofractured when the fracking fluid, gas and other hydrocarbons are regurgitated. The compounds found aren't typically very reactive in small amounts, says Roberts, but their concentrations were very high. NOx levels were sufficient to create ozone, but not particularly high.\n\n\"We think there may be some chemistry happening in the snow itself,\" he says, but it couldn't be studied since there was no snow.\n\nThey suspect that this year, with no ozone events, was the anomaly, not the previous two, when snow cover was thick and ozone levels were frequently high. So NOAA, the state and their partners hope to procure funding to study the basin again next year. \"The emissions inventory work, gathering fingerprints of sources was successful,\" says Brock LeBaron, deputy director of air quality for the Utah DEQ, and the state's point person for the study. \"Still, the fundamental question is: Should you go after the VOCs, or should you go after NOx?\"\n\nWithout an answer, it's hard to draft a sure-fire mitigation plan. In the meantime, though, regulators in both Wyoming and Utah are \"casting a big net\" when it comes to pollution controls, as Wyoming's air quality chief, Steve Dietrich, puts it. \"We'd be remiss if we concentrated on VOCs and didn't concentrate on NOx. So we're trying to reduce both of them.\"\n\n\"Green completions,\" which capture hydrocarbons and VOCs during flowback, are required throughout the Upper Green River Basin, and for new projects in the Uintah Basin, where such projects have been approved only if they install technology such as low-bleed valves to control VOC leaks from well-pad equipment; minimize truck trips; use clean-burning engines at drill rigs; and add any additional controls deemed necessary as regulators' understanding of local ozone chemistry advances. The state and BLM also hope to work with industry to ensure no net increase in emissions, beginning next winter. Wyoming drillers have taken similar steps. Most of these measures aren't legally required, but the industry and states have been trying to avoid becoming 'non-attainment' zones for ozone pollution, an EPA designation that can bring mandatory -- and probably expensive -- regulations, and could limit new energy development.\n\nSince 2009, the industry estimates that it's reduced VOC emissions by 21 percent, and NOx by 17 percent, in the Upper Green River Basin. Yet despite these emissions cuts, the problem persists. The EPA just declared the Upper Green River Basin a non-attainment zone, underscoring the need for better information to shape a strategy. Utah lacks such statistics because it's just begun requiring NOx and VOC controls of big new projects in development.\n\n\"The Uintah Basin has a couple years, probably, where we can try some out-of-the-box proactive strategies,\"before the EPA enters the fray, says the BLM's Herr. Still, in that short time, he says, \"It's kind of a long shot that we'll be able to solve it.\""}
{"text":"Pollutant particles are found in car exhaust, power-plant emissions and the smoke from fireplaces and wood stoves. Clusters of the particles produce clouds of dust, haze and smog. \"Tens of thousands of elderly people die prematurely each year from exposure to ambient levels of fine particles,\" according to EPA.\n\nIn a paper to be published in the Journal of Aerosol Science, the scientists explain how particles penetrate human airways through dispersion and expansion resulting from contact with moisture.\n\n\"As people breathe,\" said Wexler, \"a clump of fine particles called a bolus\nwill rapidly disperse throughout the lungs. At the terminal alveoli \u2014 little sacks at the end of each respiratory branch where oxygen and carbon dioxide trade places with blood \u2014 these particles take up water and expand, much like a sponge, because of hydroscopic effects.\"\n\nMathematical models of these physical events suggest that \"the smallest particles can sometimes penetrate almost two times farther into airways than we had suspected,\" said Wexler.\n\nThat's because air in the center of a lung tube flows faster than the\nsurrounding stream, he said. And, particle-laden air mixes with clean air at\neach intersection of the respiratory branches. All that secondary mixing\n\"dramatically speeds the movement of these fine particles through the\nrespiratory system,\" he said.\n\nThe next step, Sarangapani said, is to further investigate why fine particles\ncan be toxic in the lungs. \"With the current amount of knowledge available to\nus,\" he said, \"I think that the EPA's current standards are a reasonable\nresponse. But, additional research is needed to identify the precise mechanisms\ninvolved in particulate toxicity.\""}
{"text":"WFIE) -\n\nIndiana is the 4th worst state in the nation when it comes to exposing residents to toxic air pollution from coal-fired power plants, according to an analysis released today in Indiana by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).\n\nThe NRDC-compiled data show:\n\n* Indiana's electric sector ranked 4th in industrial toxic air pollution in 2010, emitting more than 26.2 million pounds of harmful chemicals, which accounted for 65 percent of state pollution and about 8 percent of toxic pollution from all U.S. power plants.\n\n* Indiana ranked 5th among all states in industrial mercury air pollution from power plants with more than 3,170 pounds emitted in 2010, which accounted for 78 percent of state mercury air pollution and 5 percent of U.S. electric sector mercury pollution.\n\nOn the national level, the report found a 19 percent decrease nationally in all air toxins emitted from power plants in 2010, the most recent data available, compared to 2009 levels. The welcomed drop, which also includes a 4 percent decrease in mercury emissions, results from two key factors. One is the increasing use by power companies of natural gas, which has become cheaper and is cleaner burning than coal; the other is the installation of state-of-the-art pollution controls by many plants--in anticipation of new health protections issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Finalized in 2011, EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics standards will cut mercury air pollution by 79 percent from 2010 levels, beginning in 2015.\n\nNeither senator from Indiana stood up for protecting kids and our communities by rejecting the attempt by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., to repeal the mercury and air toxics standard: Sens. Lugar and Coats supported the Inhofe resolution.\n\nFranz Matzner, NRDC associate director of Government Affairs, said: \"For too long, Americans have had no choice but to breathe toxic air pollution. Thanks to the EPA, the air is getting cleaner. But we need lawmakers who will help clean up the air we all breathe --- not lawmakers who do the bidding of Big Polluters trying to repeal safeguards that protect children's health. This and future Congresses should let the EPA do its job so ALL Americans can breathe easier.\"\n\nIn the second edition of \"Toxic Power: How Power Plants Contaminate Our Air and States,\" NRDC also found that coal- and oil-fired power plants still contribute nearly half (44 percent) of all the toxic air pollution reported to the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). The report also ranks the states by the amount of their toxic air pollution levels.\n\nIn an earlier assault on the EPA's new standards, the House passed a bill to gut them last year; but a similar measure in June failed in the Senate.\n\nCompared to 2010 levels, the standard will reduce mercury pollution from 34 tons to 7 tons, a 79 percent reduction, by 2015. Sulfur dioxide pollution will be reduced from 5,140,000 tons in 2010 to 1,900,000 tons in 2015, a 63 percent reduction. Another dangerous acid gas, hydrochloric acid, will be reduced from 106,000 tons in 2010 to 5,500 tons in 2015, a 95 percent reduction.\n\nWith those and other pollution reductions resulting from the standard, as many as 11,000 premature deaths and 130,000 asthma attacks, 5,700 hospital visits, 4,700 heart attacks, and 2,800 cases of chronic bronchitis will be avoided in 2016. The public health improvements are also estimated to save $37 billion to $90 billion in health costs, and prevent up to 540,000 missed work or \"sick\" days each year.\n\nDespite the overall reductions in total emissions, 18 of the Toxic 20 from 2009 remain in the 2010 list released today, although several states have made significant improvements highlighted in the report.\n\nThe EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, known as the TRI, is a national database of toxic emissions self-reported by industrial sources. Power plants report emission of mercury, hydrochloric acid, and other hazardous metals.\n\nNRDC released the first \"Toxic 20\" report in July 2011. The analysis used publicly-available data in the TRI to rank states by air pollution levels from 2009. Using the same methodology, today's analysis compared TRI emissions reported for 2010 from the electric utilities sector to those from other sectors and ranked sources by total emissions by sector. The analysis identifies top emitting power plants based on toxic emissions reported to TRI More"}
{"text":"Air pollution control\n\nFinland's air pollution control policies aim to maintain high air quality, in order to preserve healthy and pleasant residential environments, and viable natural ecosystems.\n\nHarmful effects of air pollution\n\nAir pollution can lead to problems in the soil and water, such as eutrophication and acidification, as well as hazards in the air itself, such as the formation of ozone near ground level. Gaseous pollutants, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides, represent a direct health risk, as do fine particles that can get deep inside our lungs.\n\nStill room for improvement in urban air quality\n\nThanks to well-planned measures to combat pollution from industrial plants, power stations and motor vehicles, harmful emissions and acidification have both declined in Finland considerably over the last 20 years. But natural habitats in sensitive areas are still burdened by more acidifying deposition than they can naturally cope with, so the emissions that cause these problems must still be cut even further.\n\nUrban air quality has not improved as rapidly as expected, even though traffic emissions have been curbed. Fine particles remain a serious problem, and emissions from industries, power stations, and smaller combustion plants causing fine particle concentrations should all be reduced further. The streets must also be cleaned more effectively from sand after winter season.\n\nThe Air Pollution Control Programme 2010\n\nIn September 2002, the Finnish Government approved a national programme setting maximum annual limits for emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds to be complied with from 2010 onwards. The programme contains measures to reduce emissions from energy production, transport, agriculture and industry, and also sets out ways to curb emissions from machinery, leisure boats and the small-scale combustion of wood.\n\nInternational co-operation vital\n\nThe Air Pollution Control Programme 2010 has been specifically designed to transpose the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive. The implementation of this directive throughout Europe should reduce the emissions and subsequent atmospheric deposition of pollutants that cause eutrophication and acidification in Finland, while also curbing long-range ozone and particle pollution, and thus improving air quality.\n\nAchieving these targets must involve co-ordinated international action in addition to measures taken in Finland, since a considerable proportion of the air pollution that causes problems in Finland actually originates from other European countries.\n\nAn important step forward is the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution prepared in the EU CAFE programme."}

He would have preferred to be anywhere else. It jarred Dockery\u2014today, chair of the Department of Environmental Health\u2014to confront people wearing white lab coats, holding signs that read, \"Harvard, release the data!\" Employed by an industry-backed group called Citizens for a Sound Economy, the protesters pressed on passersby fliers claiming that Harvard was hiding \"secret\" data. Their message was aimed directly at Dockery.\n\nThe year was 1997, and Dockery had arrived in Washington to tell Congress that because it had promised study participants confidentiality, Harvard couldn't share the raw data from its federally funded Six Cities study. The landmark research\u2014one of the single most influential public health studies ever conducted\u2014examined over 14 to 16 years the health effects of air pollution on more than 8,000 adults and 14,000 children in six U.S. cities. During that time, HSPH scientists published more than 100 peer-reviewed papers detailing their findings.\n\nThe blockbuster paper came in 1993, when Dockery's team described what he now calls amazing results.

The primary culprit: fine particulates, up to hundreds of times narrower than a human hair, which were associated with increased incidence of lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease. \"The effects of air pollution were about two years' reduction in life expectancy,\" Dockery says. \"It was much, much higher than we had expected.\" To Dockery and his colleagues, the results were conclusive evidence that soot produced by fossil fuel combustion kills.\n\nThat evidence was also enough for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which in 1997 used the science, along with many other studies, as the foundation for the first-ever Clean Air Act regulations on particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. The EPA claimed the new PM2.5 rules would prevent 15,000 premature deaths annually and produce other huge benefits, among them preventing 250,000 incidences of aggravated asthma, 60,000 cases of bronchitis, and 9,000 hospital admissions every year.\n\nBut meeting the new standards would be far from simple or cheap. Manufacturing, power, steel, auto and other industries spent untold millions trying to disprove the science, discredit the EPA, and defeat the new regulations. The New York Times dubbed the clash \"the environmental fight of the decade.\" It embroiled the Six Cities study in a years-long controversy\u2014one that holds lessons for public health professionals working on issues critical in this year's election cycle, from new Clean Air Act rules and oil drilling to natural gas fracking and the ubiquitous pesticides and chemicals in our food, homes, and bodies.\n\nA Deadly Cloud\n\nWhy Six Cities Matters Today\n\nThe clash between industry, politics, and science over the Six Cities study remains relevant today. Consider just a small sampling of contemporary public health controversies:\n\nGlobal Warming:\n\nA U.S. federal appeals court in June agreed with the EPA that auto and power plant emissions endanger the public health. Opponents had filed more than 60 lawsuits to block the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. As Matthew Wald of The New York Times wrote, \"The judges unanimously dismissed arguments from industry that the science of global warming was not well supported and that the agency had based its judgment on unreliable studies.\"\n\nNatural Gas Fracking:\n\nPublic health studies show the hydrofracturing, or fracking, process of drilling fouls the air and water and may contribute to earthquakes. Industry advocates question the certainty of that science and say the country needs cheap, \"clean\" fuel.\n\nMining and Cancer:\n\nThe Mining Awareness Resource Group, a mining-industry-funded organization, spent years going to the courts and to Congress for assistance in accessing data from, and delaying publication of, a study showing that miners exposed to diesel exhaust underground were at high risk of developing lung cancer. Twenty years after the study was launched, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute finally published the results.\n\nEver since a toxic black cloud dubbed the \"Great Smog\"\u2014made up primarily of coal-burning emissions and diesel exhaust\u2014hovered over London in 1952 and killed more than 4,000 people within days, environmental scientists had worried about the mysterious ingredients composing industrial haze. In the U.S., that concern intensified in 1973 following the Arab oil embargo, when power plants were expected to substitute cheap, high-sulfur coal for expensive oil. What could the nasty emissions from dirtier fuel do to people?\n\nHSPH's Ben Ferris, a legendary public health professor who died in 1996, and Frank Speizer, professor of environmental science, proposed to find out: They would sample the air quality in six Eastern cities with varying degrees of pollution while simultaneously monitoring the health of thousands of those cities' residents. Among their team were the wiry, intense Jack Spengler, now the Akira Yamaguchi Professor of Environmental Health and Human Habitation, who built personal air quality monitoring equipment that participants wore; and the tall, reserved Dockery, who traveled from city to city, setting up air pollution monitors in residents' homes. Jim Ware, professor of biostatistics, joined the team in 1979. Later, Joel Schwartz, professor of environmental epidemiology, would join the team and become one of its most prolific authors.\n\nTheir goal was simple: to identify links between illness and death rates and air pollution levels. They sampled the air for toxic emissions, including sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, a brew of acids, metals, petroleum byproducts, diesel soot, and other potentially harmful substances that readily deposit deep in the lungs.\n\nIn the mid\u20131970s, no one had yet conducted a comprehensive study of particulates' effects on human health. Dockery and his colleagues expected to learn that the true threat of industrial haze would stem from sulfur dioxide. But it was the fine particles that were the biggest dangers (although the study did not show how these particles created illness, a missing link critics would highlight). Another surprise: indoor air pollution was more harmful than outdoor toxins, setting the stage for years of important research.\n\nToday, because of Six Cities, it is conventional wisdom that particulate matter contributes significantly to a wide variety of illnesses across the spectrum of life, from asthma and bronchitis to sudden infant death syndrome and lung cancer.\n\nIndustry Responds\n\nPublic health considerations aside, the new standards forced dramatic changes on industry. The New York Times reported that old Midwestern power plants would have to install expensive pollution control equipment; states would need to invest in mass transit and other initiatives designed to reduce auto pollution; and factories that burned mountains of coal would have to switch to cleaner-burning fuels. How much those changes would cost depended upon who was doing the estimating: industry spokesmen said the bill would reach into the hundreds of billions of dollars. The EPA put the final tab at $6 to $8 billion.\n\nAs the debate grew more contentious, many experts\u2014including Philip H. Abelson, former editor of Science magazine\u2014pushed the EPA to delay regulations until the science was more certain. Abelson maintained that the makeup of particulate matter differed greatly from place to place. In an editorial, he queried, \"How can the EPA minimize the effects of particulates if it does not know what they are or which, if any, have deleterious physiological effects?\"\n\nOthers, like fellow HSPH faculty member John D. Graham, professor of policy and decision sciences at HSPH, were also critical of the EPA, arguing that the Clean Air Act's legal framework for rule making does not allow the agency to consider costs, just health outcomes. Graham had pioneered the study of risk analysis at HSPH, having founded and, from 1990 to 2001, directed the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. From 2001 to 2006, he led the White House's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, making him what the Natural Resources Defense Council called \"the second most powerful environmental official in the nation after George W. Bush.\" Today, he serves as Dean of Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs.\n\nOver the years, Graham testified at many congressional hearings that there should be an opportunity for cost\/benefit analysis during EPA rule making. \"One of my key arguments is that practical people are going to do it anyway,\" he says. \"We shouldn't make them do it behind closed doors. That's not good, because their arguments are then not open to public scrutiny.\"\n\nThe Battle Lines Harden\n\nCitizens for a Sound Economy blanketed the country with ads designed to influence public opinion. The group, which the Washington Post called the \"pro-industry alliance at the center of an extraordinary, multimillion-dollar campaign to turn back EPA regulations for smog and soot,\" attracted grassroots supporters by contending the new rules would force bans on such American icons as backyard barbecues, farm tractors, and wood stoves.\n\nIn addition, critics from industry, members of Congress, and some governors demanded that Harvard release the raw data. \"We declined,\" says James H. Ware, then HSPH acting dean and now Frederick Mosteller Professor of Biostatistics. The team had promised participants that their personal data would never be released. When Harvard refused, critics accused the researchers of conspiracy and pressured Congress to hold hearings. \"The issue is the quality of the science,\" said National Association of Manufacturers spokesman Richard Siebert. \"In order for people to ascertain the science they need to understand the background data \u2026 What are they hiding?\"\n\n\"It was a painful time,\" says Dockery. \"You'd get up in the morning and look in the paper and there you'd be again.\"\n\nStill, the scientists held their ground. \"We knew that if we released the data, it would be endless aggravation and defending against attacks,\" says Ware. \"To have a hostile group combing through your data looking for anything to attack you about was not something any of us relished.\" Furthermore, Frank Speizer told Dockery, to release the raw data would be to allow \"biased groups\" to manipulate it and to set a precedent that \"will undermine future research by academic institutions.\"\n\nEPA under siege\n\nBut the EPA, too, was under siege\u2014from lobbyists and from Congress, which demanded the agency produce so-called \"secret data\" on which the new rules rested. In February 1997, EPA bowed to the pressure and urged Harvard to do so. As a compromise, the team came up with the idea of asking an independent scientific panel to audit the researchers' findings. They gave a warehouse full of data to the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based Health Effects Institute (HEI), which was funded by both the automotive industry and the EPA.\n\nIt took HEI three years to reanalyze the data\u2014an agonizing period of limbo for the scientists. But it was worth the wait. In 2000, HEI scientists confirmed the original Six Cities findings. It was a huge win for the School.\n\nIn 1997, while HEI was auditing the data, President Bill Clinton approved the new Clean Air Act's PM2.5 regulations and tightened ozone standards. In 1999, Alabama Republican Senator Richard Shelby, still simmering about Harvard's \"hidden\" data, inserted a single sentence into a 4,000-page budget bill that would change everything for future researchers. The still-controversial Shelby Amendment calls for those university scientists working on federally funded projects to share their data with anyone who requests it via the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nWhen the issue of sharing primary data first arose, critics like HSPH's Frank Speizer feared such a rule would dampen future research by dissuading potential participants whose confidentiality could no longer be protected. Today, the issue is so fraught that, even within HSPH, scientists find themselves on opposing sides. Doug Dockery calls the Shelby Amendment \"a direct assault on research conducted by universities,\" because privately funded studies aren't subject to the same rules. In contrast, Jim Ware says, \"As a matter of principle, the Shelby Amendment is right: When the federal government pays for research \u2026 that research ought to be made available for scrutiny by others and for debate and examination.\"\n\nThe Long View\n\nToday, Dockery looks out his 13th-floor window across the Charles River at the Cambridge skyline, a view that, decades earlier, had often been obscured by urban haze. \"I can see a long way,\" he says. \"That's gratifying.\"\n\nOver the last 30 years, air quality nationwide has improved dramatically, due to Clean Air Act rules based in part on Six Cities research. In 2009, Dockery and colleagues Arden Pope (now at Brigham Young University) and Majid Ezzati (now at Imperial College London) demonstrated that from 1980 to 2000, reductions in exposure to fine particulate matter had increased average American life spans by 1.6 years. \"That's huge,\" Dockery says. \"If you got rid of all cancers, the net effect on average life expectancy would be two years.\"\n\nThe Clean Air Act and the policies triggered by HSPH's Six Cities study are classic examples of how public health should work: good science shapes public policy, and policy, in turn, saves people's lives.\n\nA Steel Backbone\n\nOn a crowded shelf in his office, Dockery keeps two six-inch-thick binders of correspondence and media clippings from the Six Cities fight. Buried in them are memories\u2014many painful\u2014but also lessons for today's public health professionals.\n\nFor Dockery, two stand out. First, \"Solid, quality science does stand up over time.\" Second: \"How you present the information\u2014how you translate the data\u2014is extremely important.\"\n\nHe believes the PM2.5 standards survived because, for the first time, the science made it possible to calculate the costs and finger the sources of air-pollution-related disease.\n\n\"We provided the basis for quantifying how many hospital visits, how many asthma attacks, how many COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] cases, how many heart attacks, and how many deaths were associated with these air pollutants,\" he says. \"It completely changed the discussion. When you actually used those numbers, suddenly the cost\/benefit analysis became very clear\u2014and suddenly, the benefits were found to far outweigh the cost of controls.\"\n\nYears later, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) analysis confirmed Dockery's claims: in a 2011 report, the OMB stated, \"Of [EPA's] 20 air rules, the rule with the highest estimated benefits is the Clean Air Fine Particle Implementation Rule, with benefits estimated at a minimum of $19 billion per year. While the benefits of this rule far exceed the costs, the cost estimate for the Clean Air Fine Particle Implementation Rule is also the highest at $7.3 billion per year.\"\n\nAlthough not everyone agrees with OMB's assessment or even with the legitimacy of assigning a price tag to health outcomes (what is the monetary value of a human life saved?), many believe such data are more important than ever. The industry lobby has gained strength in the 15 years since the Six Cities brouhaha. In 2011, a hearing before the Republican-led House of Representatives subcommittee on new Clean Air Act rules was entitled, \"Lights Out: How EPA Regulations Threaten Affordable Power and Job Creation.\"\n\nChallenges in Today's Politics\n\nThe Debate Goes On\n\nThe controversy over standards for fine particulate matter air pollution continues today. In June 2012, a federal court order forced the EPA to propose new, tighter standards; the agency settled on reducing the allowed annual level from 15 micrograms per cubic meter to a range between 13 and 12.\n\nBut a 2011 report by the American Lung Association, Clean Air Task Force, and Earthjustice claims that this reduction doesn't go far enough. Their analysis, which cites Six Cities findings, argues that at those levels, a maximum of 15,000 premature deaths would be averted annually. The coalition argues that the EPA should adopt a more stringent annual limit of 11 micrograms per cubic meter, which its analysis shows would prevent nearly 36,000 premature deaths yearly.\n\nThe EPA is expected to issue final standards in December 2012.\n\nSeen through a 2012 lens, it may be surprising that the Six Cities imbroglio wasn't a strictly partisan fight. Unlike today, earlier environmental battles didn't erupt along party lines. It was President Richard Nixon who established the EPA in 1970, setting the stage for a string of Republican environmental accomplishments, including the first major reauthorization of the Clean Air Act in 1990 under George H. W. Bush. \"When you look at the record,\" says Dockery, \"the Republican administrations have been better for environmental controls than the Democratic administrations.\"\n\nDockery believes today's political environment is actually far more difficult for science than it was in 1997. \"Before, there was the cry that we wanted the best science for defining the regulation,\" he says. Now, he adds, referring to debates like those over global warming and certain childhood vaccinations, \"What we're seeing is a total rejection of science as the basis for making regulatory decisions.\"\n\nHSPH's John Spengler has become convinced that scientists studying today's environmental problems need both new communication skills and a steel backbone. \"You really have to know you've got the personality to do this,\" he says. \"If you choose a public health career and you believe in it, and if you have an urgent public health message that needs to be delivered, this is part of the territory.\"\n\nTo Spengler, that means public health educators have a new job to do: teaching scientists how to lead and how to deliver their messages to policymakers. \"We teach people to be statisticians, epidemiologists, lab analysts, exposure scientists,\" he says. \"But we must also equip them for the big fights.\"\n\nElaine Appleton Grant is the former assistant director of development communications and marketing at HSPH and a public radio reporter.\n\nEnvironmental Threats HSPH researchers study environmental threats to health, such as hazardous substances found in the air, water, and wherever people live and work. The interplay of genes and environment on health and the importance of occupational safety are also key."}
{"text":"Wood smoke reduction significantly cuts risk of death\n\nLondon, January 9 (ANI): Biomass smoke - smoke produced by domestic cooking and heating and wood-burning - is behind a large increase in male deaths from respiratory diseases and heart failure, a new study has found.\n\nThe researchers say this could have significant impact on further interventions to reduce pollution from this source.\n\nAlthough a large amount of research has been carried out on the adverse health effects of air pollution, no studies have reported reductions in deaths associated with interventions to reduce biomass smoke pollution.\n\nIn 2001, Launceston (in Tasmania, Australia) was the setting for a series of interventions to reduce wood smoke pollution. The interventions dramatically accelerated a general trend towards using electric rather than wood heaters. As such, wood stove prevalence fell from 66 percent to 30 percent of all households and average particulate air pollution during winter was reduced by 40 percent (44 g\/m3 - 27 g\/m3).\n\nResearchers from Australia and Canada used this data to assess whether there were any significant changes in all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality.\n\nThis is the first study to assess changes in mortality associated with a reduction in smoke from domestic wood heaters. The researchers compared the population of Launceston with the population of Hobart (also in Tasmania), which did not have any air quality interventions.\n\nThe reductions in mortality (deaths per 1000 people at risk per year, adjusted for age) between 1994-2001 and 2001-2007 were not significant for males and females combined (2.7 percent for all-cause mortality; 4.9 percent for cardiovascular mortality; 8.5 percent respiratory mortality). However, reductions were statistically significant for males alone: differences of 11.4 percent for all-cause mortality; 17.9 percent for cardiovascular and 22.8 percent for respiratory.\n\nThe researchers conclude that a trend was found in reduced all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality during the period of improved air quality which was greatest during winter with stronger associations in males.\n\nThey say that the findings \"highlight the potential for important public health gains from interventions to reduce ambient pollution from biomass smoke"}
{"text":"Recent studies conducted on vacuum cleaner emissions, have vacuum cleaners as a potential source of indoor exposure to airborne allergens, bacteria and other pathogens.\n\nIn this blog post I review the issues around this occurrence and the steps manufacturers of vacuum cleaners can take to ensure their products meet certification standards, in particular the asthma & allergy friendly certification standard. As an accredited immunoassay testing facility airmid healthgroup is a designated laboratory for the program.\n\nThis blog is written by Peter Desmond, scientific contributor at airmid health group. Peter is a gradate of Trinity College Dublin with a B.A (mod.) in Microbiology\n\nThe testing of vacuum cleaners and similar domestic electrical appliances such as air cleaners involves the use of \"test-dust\"; inert particles consisting of silicon dioxide, aluminium, iron and sodium oxides. It is used to mimic typical household dust, which is composed of a mixture of fibres and particles of varying sizes and compositions. Sources of which include skin, mites, soil, heating emissions and pollen grains. In this blog post, we talk to Dr. Angela Southey, a lead researcher at airmid healthgroup, about a recent study she conducted and presented at the prestigious 13th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate in Austin, Texas comparing the characteristics of ISO fine test dust to real house dust.\n\nIntroduction to the study\n\nDomestic products, such as vacuum cleaners, are often tested using inert particle mixtures called 'test dust'. Depending on the standard's testing requirements, the test dust consists of a defined mixture of silicon dioxide, aluminium, iron and sodium oxides and other components such as talcum powder, wood flour and potassium chloride (ASTM. 2007, CEI IEC. 2004, ASTM. 2004). The test dusts are graded according to their particle size range. ISO 12103-1 A2 Fine Test Dust (or ISO Fine Dust) is a test dust with a particle size range from 1-80\uf06dm. ISO Fine Dust is used in ASTM standard F2608-07 (ASTM. 2007) for determining the change in room air particulate counts as a result of test dust removal from floor coverings with the vacuum cleaner under test. Household dust is composed of a heterogeneous mixture of fibres and irregularly shaped particles of varying particle sizes and composition. Particle sources include skin, hair, mites, plant pollen, fibres, soil, road dust, cooking emissions, heating emissions and cigarette smoke (Edwards et al. 1998; Molhave et al. 2000). Comparison of the particle size distribution of the ISO Fine Dust with that of household dust by laser diffraction, demonstrated that ISO Fine Dust bears little resemblance to the 'real' dust that a vacuum cleaner would encounter in the home (nor does it purport to).\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine if a test dust, more representative of household dust, should be produced and standardized for domestic appliance testing.\n\nASHRAE 52.2 is a method of testing general ventilation air cleaning devices to determine their removal efficiency as a function of particle size. It is a method that determines the ability of an air filter to remove particles on the basis of specfic particle sizes ranging between 0.3 to 10 microns. A central feature of ASHRAE 52.2 is the incorporation of the Minimum Efficient Reporting Value (MERV) for each filter tested. Angela Southey is the head of the environmental test chamber at airmid healthgroup. In this interview, we ask Angela about Airmid's new ASHRAE 52.2 test duct, its functional association with the Environmental Test Chamber and the importance this facility has for HVAC testing, MERV testing and its potential for contract research.\n\nThis article has been written in Q and A format following an interview with Angela Southey PhD at the test facility at airmid healthgroup and is a hugely informative interview on the subject\n\nThis post is about the new facility development at airmid healthgroup , which includes a modified ASHRAE 52.2 duct in a series loop with an ASTM\/AHAM Environmental Test Chamber and allows for the assessment of in-duct or portable air purifying systems on bio-particulates.\n\nIt has been written by Dr Bruce Mitchell, Co-Founder and CEO of airmid.\n\nOver recent years, airmid healthgroup (AHG) has become a market leader in the assessment of airborne bio-particulate load in indoor spaces. Unique services are provided to clients in both state-of-the-art large scale chambers or in \"field\" situations, i.e. environmental studies in homes, offices, and other places where individuals congregate.\n\nIn this blog post I want to bring to your attention a follow up article recently produced by airmid healthgroup which is also in the area of antimicrobial validation studies.As previously highlighted, antimicrobial technologies are receiving growing media attention due to the requirement for infection control in commonly contaminated areas. These technologies are valued for their contribution to the control of infectious diseases in sectors such as airline travel, cleanroom facilities and sports facilities.\n\nThis article on the assessment of antimicrobial surfaces and antimicrobial validation studies has been produced as a follow up to the recent interview of Dr John Fallon, Head of Microbiology.\n\nThe article goes in to further details of the various assessments and validation studies of antimicrobial surfaces developed by bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC). often quoted statistic that according to the USA EPA we spend over 80% of our time indoors, and that indoor air quality can be up to 5 times more polluted than outdoor air has new relevance with some recent changes in the indoor ecosystem. The constant drive for energy efficiency can have a negative impact on indoor air quality and recent publications about the issue of ultrafine particles is bringing air quality in the built environment under the spotlight. Consumers are reenergised about the right to breath 'fresh air indoors' and consumer products such as electrical appliances and cleaning services are coming under scrutiny. However there is a tool industry can use to fight back and that is large climate controlled environmental test chambers. Angela Southey is manager of one of the few aerobiology test facilities of its kind in the world which combines an environmental test chamber with state of the art air sampling, microbiology, molecular biology and measurement of airborne allergens.\n\nThis article has been written in Q and A format following an interview with Angela Southey PhD at the test facility at airmid healthgroup and is a hugely informative interview on the subject"}

{"text":"Advanced Ventilation Strategies\n\nIndoor environmental quality (IEQ), a critical component to hospital's air conditioning and ventilation systems, if not maintained at optimum effifiency, hospitals can be exposed to a variety of microbes and airborne contaminants.\n\nHospitals and health care facilities are those that are most impacted by the constant challenge of regulating optimal room conditions. All facilities pertaining to the medical industry must be air conditioned. Unfortunately, the high energy cost of air conditioning can sometimes lead to inadequate and improperly designed systems that don't provide enough ventilation. Since many hospital patrons are patients who are ill, and more susceptible than the general public to developing adverse reaction from poor IEQ, the quality of the indoor air is paramount. Additionally, a hospital's air conditioning and ventilation systems can be exposed to a variety of microbes and airborne contaminants. In the absence of the right ventilation strategies, these illness and disease bearing pollutants can negatively impact the health and comfort off all the hospital's occupants \u2013 visitors and employees \u2013 and not just the patients. Hospitals also use materials that, if broken or improperly disposed of, can result in the release of harmful airborne contaminants such as mercury and dioxin. Mercury can be found in thermometers, blood pressure cuffs, older thermostats and fluorescent lamps, and dioxin can be emitted when products containing PVC, such as some IV bags and surgical tubing, are burned.\n\nIn addition to these harmful environmental toxins, hospitals must consider how airborne particles influence overall IEQ, since these particles can form fine particle aerosols that transport disease-causing microbes. Without efficient ventilation and filtration systems, a hospital could be seriously limiting its operational safety. Hill York's Performance Group, hygreen, offers a solution.\n\nMultiparameter Demand-Controlled Ventilation\n\nWe work hand in hand with facility managers and esteemed members of FHEA, Florida's leading healthcare facility management organization. When you find yourself proactively investigating green \u2013 that is, sustainable and energy efficiency \u2014 air conditioning and ventilation solutions, you should consider the advantages of implementing a multiparameter demand-controlled ventilation system.\n\nHow it works?\n\nThis dynamic method of ventilation senses a variety of airborne contaminants and increases the ventilation rate to dilute and purge the affected spaces. The system utilizes multiple sample points or sensors that are placed in various areas of the hospital to measure contaminants in real time. Air samples are collected from each area every few minutes and analyzed locally or transported to a centralized sensor array for analysis. Several hospitals have begun implementing safer and more energy efficient ventilation strategies throughout Florida.\n\nIn addition to the new construction of energy-efficient HVAC systems, you can also retrofit your air conditioning and ventilation systems to accommodate a safer, more efficient approach to ventilation and cooling.\n\nMultiparameter demand-controlled ventilation systems, can affordably be built into your facility management\/operational budget.

{"text":"The link between air pollution and cardiovascular disease\n\nFeeling a bit short of breath? You can blame pollution. A research group based at the University of Rochester Medical Centre in New York has been measuring our response to miniscule particles found in our atmosphere. The pollutant particles, which we breathe in as part of our everyday life, have long been associated with and thought to exacerbate several cardiovascular and respiratory conditions.\n\nA study conducted by the Rochester team and published in the industry Journal Environmental Health Perspectives revealed that individuals suffering from underlying medical conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes may be adversely affected by environmental pollutants. Researchers discovered that when a person suffering from Diabetes inhales the tiny particles of pollution carried within our air supply, their platelet count \u2013 blood cells which are typically associated with blood coagulation and clotting actions \u2013 are activated.\n\nThe activation of platelets has been show to contribute to heart disease, and this contributory factor has established the causative link between atmospheric pollutants and cardiovascular problems. While pollution has been shown to aggravate re-established health conditions before, it was not understood how this aggravation worked, nor had evidence been found to explain how pollution resulted in deteriorating health.\n\nThe Diabetic test subjects selected for the study were all at risk of suffering from some form of heart conditions, and the research team recorded their physical responses when exposed to ultrafine particles of pollutant materials. Judith Stewart, who lead the research team said of their findings: \"What's interesting about our new results is not so much what it shows about people with diabetes, ratherThe pollutants, which are produced by vehicles such as cars and trucks, as well as by the process of cooking, cleaning and vacuuming and even running power plants, are essentially chemical formulas released into the atmosphere. These miniscule particles find their way into our respiratory systems and can cause all manner of problems, including leading to heart attacks.\n\nStewart and her team found that while the risk posed by pollutants to healthy individuals was very low, the risk posed to individuals prone to cardiovascular disease was a definite problems. Platelet formation, while usually a helpful process designed to stem bleeding and promote wound healing, can be a problem where the arteries are clogged. The exacerbated production of blood clots can increase the likelihood of a heart attack and increase susceptibility too heart-related health problems.\n\nThe message is clear; pollution poses a real risk to an identifiable group of people. This means that at-risk groups should attempt to control their exposure to pollution, for example by remaining indoors in a situation where the air quality outside is especially contaminated by pollutants. Hopefully this research will help to minimise the human cost of pollution, and to manage personal exposure so as to avoid risk of harm"}
{"text":"Guatemala and rain! Have you ever walked outside after an electrical storm and noticed how vital the air seems? This is due to the negatively charged ions and extra oxygen in the air. This \"charged air\" is actually more vital and healthy than regular air, mostly because it contains ozone.\n\nWhile air is known as O2, ozone is actually O3. This extra oxygen molecule is easily liberated, and when it enters the human body it offers incredible health benefits. Oxygen is vital to your health, and ozone is a vital form of oxygen. When ozone comes in contact with a moist surface it will release the extra oxygen. This makes ozone an ideal cleaning agent. Ozone is used worldwide to purify drinking water, and ozone-infused water is excellent for rinsing foods and keeping gums super healthy.\n\nSlice of Guatemala's rainy season. (photo: Rudy Gir\u00f3n)\n\nThe medical use of ozone has been studied by doctors since the 1800s as they quickly discovered that it helps with wound healing and all forms of tissue repair. Ozone's extra oxygen molecule not only oxidizes (destroys) bacteria and viruses, it also releases oxygen into the tissues for faster healing. The only caution is that ozone should not be inhaled directly into the lungs in large concentrations, as the delicate tissues can be irritated. Ozone can safely enter the bloodstream through injection or by direct contact with the skin and mucus membranes.\n\nWondrous healing results have been documented from ozone therapy, from cancers to inflammations to the reversal of AIDS symptoms. Scientist Nikola Tesla patented an ozone generator in 1896, and it was widely used to help heal skin irritations, bug bites and wounds.\n\nWhile the FDA has stalled the use of ozone in the U.S., it is a highly regarded treatment throughout Europe and many other countries. It is especially valuable in dentistry, where the teeth and gums must be thoroughly cleansed before placing a restoration. Thousands of studies have demonstrated that ozone is safer than any pharmaceutical drug and virtually free from side effects.\n\nOzone treatment reverses many cancers and other medical problems. This is because our bodies were designed to use oxygen. The addition of ozone offers a boost to the body's natural healing processes. In fact, in ancient times the oxygen level in the air was far higher than today. It has been demonstrated that pre-historic oxygen levels exceeded 35 per cent of the air; our air today only holds 20 percent of this important gas. Without adequate oxygen, brain function suffers, cancer cells grow and aging is accelerated. This is one of the reasons why doctors recommend exercise\u2014it is not just about moving the body; it is recommendedbecause exercise increases blood flow and brings oxygen to the tissues. Oxygen supports health.\n\nTransdermal ozone is a method in which ozone is introduced into the body via the skin while the individual is sitting in a hot steam cabinet. An ozone steam cabinet offers tremendous health benefits. The pores of the skin open as a result of being surrounded by the warm steam, and ozone enters the body transdermally (i.e. via the skin). The ozone then penetrates the blood, lymph and fat. Steam ozone therapy is one of the most powerful methods of detoxifying and oxygenating the body in existence.\n\nSteam ozone has a very beneficial effect on the body and one's emotions. This is because heat has a naturally relaxing effect and partly because ozone breaks down excess adrenaline in the body, producing overall calm. We have offered this treatment at both our Lake Atitl\u00e1n spa at TOSA La Laguna and our new Antigua Avesa Holistic spa. Consistently theresults are a quick, relaxing way to restore peak health and vitality. Regular use of a steam ozone therapy can help to keep your body operating at its best.\n\nWhen ozone steam therapy becomes regular part of your wellness program you will immediately feel the positive results and gain that natural smile of vitality."}

Below it is Cordoba and the thousands of vehicles and industries that emit daily air pollutants that are over our heads. This is the famous smog in winter, a weather phenomenon, remains very low, which makes it more visible than in other seasons and more damaging to health.\n\nMedical and environmental experts contend that the accumulation of these pollutants in the sky, especially in the downtown, are a very annoying problem for people with chronic respiratory conditions and may cause allergic reactions outside this risk group.\n\nFrom the City Environmental Observatory detailed that among the contaminants found in greater CO (carbon monoxide), but provided no details on what volume of these elements are concentrated in city air.\n\n\"This can cause respiratory irritation level, especially if a situation particularly cold weather during the day, no break of the inversion. Then most important pollution is generated. In Cordoba, the situation is delicate, \"he said Federico Kept, Cordoba Environment Forum.\n\nBartholomew Lunge, phonologist doctor, said: \"People with chronic lung diseases like asthma, bronchitis or emphysema are more vulnerable to contamination. Smog can encourage respiratory infections with exacerbation of the disease. \"He added: \"The sulfur oxide and nitrogen is the most harmful is the smog, and also create many problems of micro particles by poor combustion of diesel vehicles.

Children, the elderly and people with respiratory issues were advised to limit outdoor activity.\n\nOzone is produced when pollutants from things like cars and lawn mowers mix with the air, so the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency encouraged people to postpone vehicle trips and reduce engine idling. Limiting use of gasoline-powered equipment, paint, solvents and burning wood can also make a difference, officials said.\n\n\"Across the country all the central United States is being affected by the smoke from the wildfires in Arizona. And part of the emissions from those fires do actually contribute to the formation of ozone,\" she said.\n\nMcMahon said it's the first ozone air alert for the metro area since 2007.\n\n\"We're out of practice on the ozone alerts a little bit,\" she said. \"Mainly we've been issuing air quality alerts for fine particle pollution, which is a pollutant that can happen year round. But ozone is definitely a signature on hot, sunny, summer days.\"\n\nMcMahon said people in suburban and exurban communities often have the highest ozone concentrations due to the way the chemicals are transported by the wind.\n\nA cold front will move through the Twin Cities on Wednesday, bringing a cleaner air mass to the region. Temperatures are also expected to drop into the 70s.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the temperature at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport hit 102 degrees Tuesday afternoon. That's the hottest it's been in the Twin Cities since 1988.\n\nAn excessive heat warning remained in effect until Wednesday morning.\n\nThe weather service said the previous record for June 7 was 95 degrees set in 2004. The all-time record for the month of June is 104 degrees, set in 1934, and forecasters said there's still a chance temperatures could get that high.\n\nThe heat forced a delayed start for the State Boys' Lacrosse Tournament games, which will each be played an hour later. The Minnesota State High School League said officials might schedule one-minute water breaks during each four minutes of play if necessary, as turf temperature will be hotter than the air temperature.\n\nAt least two people were treated at Regions Hospital in St. Paul for heat exhaustion Monday, and a third person sought care Tuesday for sunburn, according to a Regions spokeswoman.\n\nDr. Gary Mayeux, a Regions emergency doctor, said some of the first signs a person is suffering from heat exhaustion is nausea and vomiting. In extreme cases, people can be so dehydrated they aren't sweating.\n\n\"A lot of people know what to look for when they're looking at a severely dehydrated patient, but you want to pay extra close attention, especially to kids and the elderly who might not be as vocal about how they're feeling,\" Mayeux said.\n\nOther symptoms can include a fast pulse or confusion, he said.\n\nMonday's 97-degree mark caused highway pavement to buckle in 28 different places in the Twin Cities. All the roads have since been fixed, but MnDOT officials were watching for a repeat today, said spokesman Todd Kramascz.\n\n\"The right amount of volume on that roadway, given that temperature and humidity can cause breakup"}

According to a study published in the International Journal of Green Economics, higher levels of air pollution are correlated with greater unhappiness. In addition, the converse is true\u2014countries with unhappier citizens have more air pollution.\n\nRelated topics\n\nThe study, conducted by economists at Trent University, in Ontario, Canada, draws on air pollution data recorded from 14 European countries. Happiness in the same countries was determined by survey. Results show that citizens of countries with higher air pollution have lower measures of happiness. But the research didn't look at the mechanism by which pollution influences happiness.\n\nThe paper summarizes existing research on the relationship between happiness and other factors, including economy. For example, studies have shown that economic growth in America in the decades following World War II was not associated with increased happiness. In general, economic research suggests that per capita income and growth rate don't predict citizen happiness. To maximize happiness, governments need to focus beyond economic factors\u2014leading to efforts to identify what most strongly influences happiness.\n\nPrior studies have linked factors including physical health and social connections with happiness. One reason this new study is notable is that its results indicate that air pollution can cause unhappiness, strengthening the case for environmental regulation.\n\nAir pollution already is known to have serious health consequences. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that outdoor air pollution causes roughly 1.3 million human deaths worldwide every year. WHO also reports that residents of cities with lower air pollution levels have better respiratory and cardiac health. Long-term exposure to air pollution increases the incidence of a range of conditions, including lung cancer, breathing disorders and cardiovascular disease. But despite the documented health hazards of air pollution, the Clean Air Act often is attacked by proponents of fossil fuel and other industries.\n\nMost major air pollutants come from the same source as does climate-disrupting carbon dioxide\u2014human use of fossil fuels. Five of the six air pollutants monitored by the EPA\u2014carbon monoxide, particulate matter, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide\u2014are produced by the use of fossil fuels in power plants and motor vehicles. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will help reduce air pollution and improve human health, as well as address climate change. This new study suggests it also may make us happier.\n\nAfter receiving a master's degree in Evolutionary Biology from The University of Chicago, Francie Stotz spent 16 years developing exhibitions at The Field Museum.

A team of graduating seniors has created a system for public transit that would continually clear the air of pathogens that can lead to tuberculosis (TB), flu and pneumonia.\n\nThe CityBusters Joseph Spinella, Jerry Lue, Sundeep Mandava, Grace Ching and Shidong Chen, all seniors have installed a $500 device on a METRO bus in Houston that has proven effective at killing 99.8 percent of the pathogens that circulate through the air-filtering system. The device, called FluProof, incorporates high-powered ultraviolet lamps that sterilize the air on the fly.\n\nSpinella said research by others has suggested that buses, being enclosed public spaces, can provide an environment for the spread of TB and other diseases. \"These are closed spaces where people are in close proximity, and you have an active air-conditioning system that's continually mixing up the air and spreading it to all the passengers,\" he said.\n\nThe Rice project stemmed from the results of a study called the Houston Tuberculosis Initiative (HTI). Researchers worked from 1995 to 2004 to identify patterns of transmission in the region that though the disease is still rare has the second-largest TB population in the nation. They were surprised to find a correlation between riders of city buses and cases of tuberculosis.

{"text":"News Release\n\nContact\n\nToday Environment New York released a new report showing that both New York City and Long Island are among the top twenty smoggiest large metropolitan areas in the country. Smog is a harmful air pollutant that leads to asthma attacks and exacerbates respiratory illnesses, especially among children and the elderly. The new report, Danger in the Air: Unhealthy Air Days in 2010 and 2011, also found that there were 14 days in 2010 in New York City and 13 days in Long Island when smog levels exceeding the national health standard. Residents of New York City were also exposed to a \"red-alert\" day, when the air quality was so poor that anyone could experience adverse health effects. This summer, residents in the New York, Newark and Bridgeport area have already been alerted to unhealthy air on 27 days.\n\n\"New Yorkers deserve clean air. But on far too many days, people in the New York City and Long Island areas are exposed to dangerous smog pollution,\" said Eric Whalen, Environment New York's Field Organizer. \"For the sake of our children, we must make every day a safe day to breathe.\"\n\nThe new report ranks cities in New York and across the country for the number of days when the air was unhealthy to breathe due to smog pollution last year and this summer, and includes new data showing that because of outdated air quality standards, New Yorkers have been unknowingly exposed dangerous air quality. The research shows that on 14 additional days last year, residents in New York City were exposed to smog levels that a national scientific panel has found to be dangerous to breathe, but because of outdated federal air quality rules, those at risk were never alerted to unhealthy air levels.\n\nPeggy Shepard the executive director of West Harlem Environmental Action (WE ACT), Dr. Paul Ehrlich the incoming president of the New York Allergy and Asthma Society, and New York State Assemblymembers Linda B. Rosenthal (D\/WF-Manhattan) and Felix Ortiz (D-Brooklyn) joined Environment New York in releasing today's report outside of New York City Hall.\n\nSmog is one of the most harmful air pollutants, and is also one of the most pervasive. Smog is formed when pollution from cars, power plants, and industrial facilities reacts with other pollutants in the presence of sunlight. Smog is of particular concern in the summer months when warmer temperatures lead to the build-up of higher concentrations of smog pollution.\n\nOn days with elevated levels of smog pollution, children, the elderly, and people with respiratory illness suffer the most. Children who grow up in areas with high levels of smog may develop diminished lung capacity, putting them at greater risk of lung disease later in life. Additionally, children exposed to smog in the womb can experience lower birth weight and growth retardation. Even among healthy adults, repeated exposure to smog pollution over time permanently damages lung tissues, decreases the ability to breathe normally, exacerbates chronic diseases like asthma, and can even cause premature death.\n\nDr. Paul Ehrlich, incoming president of the New York Allergy and Asthma Society commented on the impact of smog pollution, saying \"A poor respiratory environment for children may lead to recurrent infections, loss of school days and hospitalization.\"\n\n\"New York City has some of the country's highest asthma-related hospitalization and mortality rates among children and young adults \u2014 with African American and Latino patients accounting for more than 80 percent of the cases,\" said Peggy Shepard, executive director of West Harlem Environmental Action (WE ACT). \"State and federal governments should accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels and toward a clean energy economy.\"\n\nUnder the federal Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency is required to set a national standard for smog pollution according to the latest science on air quality and public health. However, the current standard was set at a level that EPA's own board of independent scientists agree is not adequately protective of public health. The Obama administration considered updating the standard this year to protect public health, but the president decided earlier this month to abandon this effort until 2013. Environment New York and prominent public health groups expressed deep disappointment with his decision.\n\n\"For too long, smog pollution has left our children gasping for breath,\" said Whalen. \"Unfortunately, rather than acting decisively to protect our kids from dangerous air pollution, President Obama chose to kick the can down the road. New York's kids, senior citizens and those suffering from respiratory problems will suffer as a consequence and certainly deserve better.\"\n\n\"New York City is well known for its innovation, and we pride ourselves on being ahead of the curve on a number of issues, including environmental issues. That's why it is distressing that New York City was ranked one of the top five smoggiest metropolitan areas in the country in 2011,\" said Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal (D\/WF-Manhattan). \"Our children deserve better, and frankly, we can and must do better to ensure the safety of the air we breathe. We have a responsibility to reduce our dependence on dirty, dangerous and expensive fossil fuels and move to clean, safe and renewable sources of energy, such as wind, solar and hydroelectric power,\" said Assemblymember Rosenthal.\n\nEnvironment New York called on the president to protect the health of New York's children and seniors, and to establish an updated standard for smog pollution that is based on the science. A strong standard could save up to 12,000 lives and prevent up to 58,000 asthma attacks each year. At this time, polluters and their allies in the House of Representatives are threatening to make the problem even worse by pushing a bill this week\u2014the TRAIN Act (H.R. 2401)\u2014to roll back existing smog pollution standards for power plants.\n\n\"We must make every day a safe day to breathe,\" said Whalen. \"President Obama and New York's members of Congress should stand up for New Yorker's health and oppose any attacks to the Clean Air Act, including voting against a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives this week that would roll back existing clean air protections for smog and other deadly pollutants.\""}

{"text":"Particle Pollution Resources\n\nAmericans breathe small amounts of polluted air. And not just from power plants. Trucks, cars and even fires produce microscopic soot particles and chemicals that can damage your lungs.\n\nWhat is particle pollution?\n\nParticle pollution refers to a combination of fine solids and aerosols that are suspended in the air. Particles range in size from the tiny to the microscopic.\n\nWhat is the source of particles in the air?\n\nAccording to the American Lung Association, combustion of fossil fuels is the major source of fine particle emissions into the atmosphere. They may be emitted into the air as smoke from wood stoves or agricultural burning or as soot from the exhaust of diesel trucks, buses and heavy equipment. Fine particles can also be formed from gaseous emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides and organic compounds that are transformed in the atmosphere into sulfate, nitrate, and carbonaceous aerosols. The major sources of these emissions are coal-fired power plants, factories, and cars.\n\nHow can you limit exposure to fine particle air pollution?\n\nThe American Lung Association offers the following tips:\n\nAvoid exercising near high-traffic areas\n\nDo not exercise outdoors when particle levels are high, or substitute an activity that requires less exertion\n\nThere was an article on how diesel trains emit the amount of particles equivalent to 120 coal fired power plants. I remember the first Earth Day in 1971, it seemed like it had more to do with not polluting rivers and lakes, but air quality has always been very important.

{"text":"July 11, 2011\n\nBmore due for \"Code red\" unhealthy air today\n\nIt's not just the heat, or the humidity - it's the bad air. Experts are forecasting \"code red,\" or seriously unhealthy, levels of smog or ozone pollution today in the Baltimore area.\n\nAir quality is expected to be bad enough today to cause even healthy people to experience shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, fatigue, headaches, nausea, chest pain, and eye and throat irritation if exercising or working outdoors. People jogging, biking or making any other sort of exertion may feel pain in their chest when taking deep breaths. And people with asthma or cardiac or respiratory conditions are likely to have more severe reactions to such high ozone levels.\n\nAuthorities recommend that people avoid outdoor exercise when ozone levels are expected to hit red levels. And Clean Air Partners, a nonprofit group that attempts to educate the public about air quality, recommends that people take steps to reduce the pollution that forms ozone, by reducing driving, turning off lights and reducing electricity use and by not operating gasoline-powered lawn equipment.\n\nIf ozone does reach forecasted \"red\" levels, it would be the fifth time this year in the Baltimore area, compared with just two \"code red\" days in the region by this time last summer.\n\nOzone levels are forecast to reach \"code orange\" levels in the Washington area, with air quality still bad enough to cause discomfort and health problems for sensitive individuals. The DC area has had six \"code red\" days so far this year.\n\nUnless I missed one, this is the first time air-quality forecasters have warned ahead of time that ozone would hit code red levels. They've forecast plenty of \"code orange\" days, only to see air quality turned out to be actually worse than expected. They've issued alerts after the fact - sometimes hours later, too late to do any good at warning people to stay indoors.\n\nOfficials at the Maryland Department of the Environment say forecasters aren't low-balling their air quality predictions. Several of those \"orange\" forecasts were for ozone levels to climb nearly to the red level, they pointed out, so they weren't significantly off.\n\nSmog or ozone pollution forms when vehicle exhaust, paint fumes and power plant emissions, among other things, mix in the lower atmosphere under strong sunlight and generally windless skies.\n\nBut here in Maryland, as in most other eastern states, our air quality is a function of what people in other states are doing, not just us. State officials estimate that 50 to 70 percent of the ozone affecting Marylanders' breathing comes from out of state, borne by prevailing winds from sources to our west and south.\n\nThat long-distance pollution is why the Environmental Protection Agency last week ordered power plants in 27 states to sharply curtail their emissions of nitrogen oxide, a key smog ingredient. The rule also requires steep cuts in emissions of sulfur dioxide, a source of fine particle pollution that also impairs breathing, though year-round, not just in"}

{"text":"Air Quality in Phnom Penh\n\nMapping of Airborne Particulates: Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n\nThe city of Phnom Penh is experiencing growth and, with this growth, an increased level of air pollution. The most obvious form of air pollution is airborne particles that are attributed to increased vehicle traffic in the city - vehicular exhaust and re-entrained dust. For this study, airborne particulates were counted and sorted using a six-channel (0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 \u00b5m) laser particle counter. Initial sample counts were taken at 88 sites within the city of Phnom Penh, Cambodia from January 15 to17, 2007. These dates are representative of dry season conditions in Phnom Penh. A subset of 33 sites was re-sampled on June 19, 2007, a date representative of the wet season in Phnom Penh. Objectives of this study are to provide a baseline count for airborne particulates in the city of Phnom Penh, and to explore the characteristics of the particulate counts utilizing summary statistics and maps. The median Phnom Penh city-wide fine and coarse particle counts are 1.07 *108 \/m3 and 1.36*106 \/m3, respectively. Fine and coarse particle counts were 22 and 37 percent lower, respectively, during the wet season as compared to the dry season. While the fine particle count can be attributed to vehicle exhaust, the coarse particle count is attributed to re-entrained road dust and dirt roads. The overall coarse particle count is influenced by a number of hot spots across the city. Selective paving of these hot spots will greatly reduce the level of airborne coarse particulate."}
{"text":"The quality of the air we breathe affects our health. Although Australia's air quality is better than in many other comparable countries, it is important to take steps now to ensure that air quality is protected into the future. Even small improvements in air quality can achieve benefits for human health and wellbeing.\n\nHigh concentrations of the major air pollutants are associated with respiratory problems such as coughs, bronchitis, asthma and, in severe cases, developmental problems in children, and even death. The economic benefits from reducing air pollution include savings in health expenditure and fewer sick days by employees.\n\nThrough the National Environment Protection Council, the Australian, State and Territory Governments agreed to the National Environment and Protection Measure for Ambient2 Air Quality on 26 June 1998. The Measure was developed by governments in consultation with health professionals, environmental groups and the community. It aims to improve the health of Australians through improved air quality.\n\nThe Measure sets air quality standards that are legally binding on each level of government. Jurisdictions put strategies in place to reduce emissions and to achieve the standards set out below. The standards relate to six criteria air pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, photochemical oxidants, sulfur dioxide, lead and particles. Significant achievements have been made in improving Australia's air quality over recent years. (See the State of the Air Report: Community Summary 1991\u20132001.)\n\nThe standards were set on the basis of scientific studies of air quality and human health from all over the world, as well as the standards set by other organisations, such as the World Health Organization. Australian conditions, eg climate, geography and demographics, were taken into account in estimating the likely exposure of Australians to these major air pollutants. Each air quality standard has two elements: the maximum acceptable concentration and the period of time period over which the concentration is averaged.\n\nThe Measure includes requirements for monitoring and reporting on jurisdictions' performance in reducing the levels of the six specified air pollutants. The goal is for the standards to be met in all States and Territories by 2008, with few exceedences3. In the case of lead, no exceedences are allowed. A review of the Measure is currently underway.\n\nThe Measure also improves the consistency of reporting on levels of air pollution across Australia. Improved information about air quality helps governments to manage polluters and therefore helps to improve the protection of Australia's air quality.\n\nOther steps have been taken to protect Australia's air quality. These include pollution control measures, such as the phasing out of leaded petrol by 1 January 2002, the introduction of vehicle emission standards and the implementation of national fuel quality standards.\n\nThe National Environment Protection Measure for Air Toxics was made in 2004. (See fact sheet on air toxics.) The aim of this Measure is to gather data on a category of air pollutants called 'air toxics'. Air toxics are receiving increasing attention internationally and in Australia."}
{"text":"Air Quality\n\nThe Council has a statutory duty to periodically review and assess the air quality in its area. This involves comparing the measured or predicted pollutant levels against National Air Quality Standards and Objectives.\n\nNB Ozone and PAH remain as national objectives not prescribed in regulation and presently remain outside the scope of Local Air Quality Management\n\nObjectives have been set at levels for which there would be no or extremely low risk to health.\n\nShould the Council identify area(s) where there may be exceed these objectives, then it is required to carry out more detailed assessments. Should they continue to exceed still appear likely the Council has to designate the area(s) as Air Quality Management Areas (AQMA(s)) and develop Action Plans, setting out how the authority intends to improve the air quality in order to achieve the objective levels.\n\nIn general the air quality in Central Bedfordshire meets the Air Quality Objective levels set by the Government.\n\nCurrently there is one declared Air Quality Management Area currently in force. This is in Dunstable and was declared in January 2005. The pollutant of concern is nitrogen dioxide which principally is due to road traffic. An Air Quality Action Plan is currently being developed in order to identify options to work towards reducing concentrations of nitrogen dioxide to meet the Government's objective level.\n\nThere was a second Air Quality Management Area declared in March 2005 in relation to sulphur dioxide emissions from Stewartby Brickworks. The AQMA included the villages of Marston Moretaine and Houghton Conquest and surrounding countryside areas. However, as of February 2008 Stewartby Brickworks ceased production of bricks at this site as a result of not being able to achieve the air quality objectives for sulphur dioxide. This area was therefore revoked as sulphur dioxide levels have reduced dramatically.\n\nCentral Bedfordshire Council continues to monitor the air quality in its district, currently it monitors for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2); Particulate Matter (PM10) and Ground Level Ozone (O3).\n\nThere are essentially two methods of measuring pollutant concentrations:\n\n1. Diffusion tubes - small plastic tubes that absorb pollutants, which are then sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results obtained are monthly averages and are used to give long term trends in levels of pollutants in an area.\n\n2. Real time analysers - machines that accurately measure levels of pollutants in the air constantly.\n\nThe Herts and Beds Air Quality Monitoring Network was formed in 1999 by all the District\/Borough Councils in the two counties and ERG (Kings College London). Luton Airport also joined the Network in 2003.\n\nThe Network was formed principally to collate and report air quality monitoring results from across the region. The network's aims are:\n\nto provide the public with easy and free access to information about the quality of the air that they are breathing;\n\nto provide regular reports comparing air quality across the region;\n\nto assist in developing local and national strategies to improve air quality;\n\nto set up an archive of monitoring results;\n\nto ensure a consistently high standard of monitoring data across the region.\n\nThe equipment used to accurately monitor air pollutants is complex and very sensitive. Consequently, purchase and running costs of each continuous monitoring site are high. By sharing information across the network, the local authorities can create a more comprehensive and detailed picture of pollution levels throughout the two counties."}

{"text":"The tiniest bits of airborne soot from vehicle exhaust, power plants and industries have the potential to affect global climate and take a much bigger toll on human health than previously thought, according to a new study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nPublished last week in the journal Science, their findings show that the microscopic particles, altered by chemical processes in the atmosphere, produce more clouds and are potentially more toxic, and their contributions to unhealthy pollution are larger and spread over a wider area.\n\nThe research by professors Allen Robinson and Neil Donahue raises questions about the effectiveness of federal particle regulations that were just tightened in September and concludes that the government needs new ways of measuring and regulating smoke and soot.\n\n\"One of our key findings is that this chemical processing leads to more particulate matter in the air, meaning that regulators are likely underestimating how sources such as cars and trucks contribute to pollution,\" said Dr. Robinson, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy. \"We need to take a holistic approach to regulating these sources that account for all emissions.\"\n\nHe said the government's pollution models overestimate direct emissions from diesel trucks, cars and power plants, but fail to accurately account for the more toxic particulates formed aloft. The Carnegie Mellon research shows that the chemical production of particles in the atmosphere also leads to a spreading of pollution over a wider geographic area.\n\n\"We're seeing that urban pollution doesn't stay contained in the cities, but impacts rural and other downwind areas, creating even more complicated issues for regulators,\" Dr. Robinson said.\n\nAirborne particles or soot have long been the least understood components of the global climate system, but ones that pose a serious health risk because they are breathed deep into the lungs.\n\nApproximately 20,000 Americans die prematurely each year because of particle exposure -- primarily from heart disease -- and almost 70 million live in areas that violate the federal limits.\n\nEach year, soot also causes nearly 300,000 asthma attacks and 2 million lost workdays due to respiratory ailments.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that each ton of soot boosts health costs by $100,000 annually.\n\nThe fine airborne particles also play a big role in climate change, the research shows, by forming droplets in clouds that affect how much sun is able to pass through and the amount of moisture that is returned to the planet's surface. That strong influence on cloud formation can alter the global climate.\n\n\"The more we understand particulate matter, the more we realize that complexity has been masking our ability to calculate how big a role greenhouse gases have played in inducing global warming,\" said Dr. Donahue, an associate professor of chemical engineering and chemistry.\n\n\"Moreover, the new mechanism we found changes the chemical properties of particles, making them more likely to participate in cloud formation.

{"text":"Roseville Rail Yard Air Quality Study Questions and Answers\n\nQ: Why did the Air Resources Board conduct the Roseville Rail Yard Air Quality Study?\n\nA. The Placer County Air Pollution Control District requested the California Air Resources Board (ARB) study on behalf of Placer county residents to learn the levels of diesel emissions from the J.R. Davis Rail Yard and their relative impact. The District requested the study because of residents' concerns and because the ARB had identified \"diesel particulate matter\" as a toxic air contaminant.\n\nQ. Why is ARB concerned about diesel particulate matter?\n\nA. Diesel engines emit a complex mixture of air pollutants, composed of gaseous and solid material. The visible emissions in diesel exhaust are known as particulate matter or PM, which includes carbon particles or \"soot\". In 1998, ARB identified diesel PM as a toxic air contaminant. Health risks from diesel PM are highest in areas of concentrated emissions, such as near ports, rail yards or freeways.\n\nQ. What are the results of the study?\n\nA. The study results indicate high concentrations of \"diesel particulate matter\" - which can cause cancer - in an area surrounding the rail yard. The level of cancer risk associated with diesel emissions from the rail yard depends on length of exposure and proximity to the yard.\n\nQ. What is being done to address these study results?\n\nA. The District is committed to working with Union Pacific to reduce emissions at the rail yard. The Air Resources Board is also involved in this effort. At this time we do not have a binding agreement with UP in place for an emissions reduction plan, but we hope to have one soon.\n\nQ. What can I do?\n\nA. There are no practical personal protective measures recommended for healthy individuals. Individuals with unique sensitivities such as chronic lung disease or asthma may consider indoor air filtering units such as those described on the Air Resources Board web site.\n\nFor information about general diesel exhaust impacts, the public may call: John Budroe, Ph.D.; California Office of Environmental Health Hazards Assessments, (510) 622-3145\n\nThe public should continue to use routine Air Quality Index advisories as their guide for understanding potential health impacts of an immediate nature related to air pollution.

{"text":"to make sure your indoor air is healthy\n\nAs\n\nThink again. Air pollution is a very serious concern indoors. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists poor indoor air quality as one of the top five environmental threats. It also reports indoor air is three to five times more contaminated than outdoor air, on average.\n\n\"When warm weather rolls around, and the natural thing to do is open up your windows and bring new air into your house,\" says Matt Mongiello, president of the National Air Duct Cleaners Association. \"However, this is when allergy season is at its highest, and you're welcoming new pollutants into your home and contaminating your air with pollens.\"\n\nThese pollutants are then blown through your house five to seven times each day by your heating, ventilation and air conditioning system. And the cleaning you're doing? All those dust bunnies are just groupings of millions of little particles of dust, dander and pollen. When broken up, many of the particles go back into the air, circulate around through your house and once again collect under your sofa.\n\nSome tips to keep the air you breathe inside as clean as possible include:\n\n* Install hardwood floors versus carpeting. Carpeting traps particles, and with every step you take across it, those particles are released back into the air.\n\n* Have carpets professionally cleaned with a truck-mounted system.\n\n* Use natural- or botanical-based cleaners instead of chemicals.\n\n* Regularly change your furnace filter \u2013 most experts recommend doing this every two months. This will help remove particles circulating through the air.\n\n* Have your heating and cooling system thoroughly cleaned. This is because dust and other air pollutants collect in the vents, and then are picked up by the air stream and blown back into the house.\n\nNADCA recommends homeowners take off the cover of an air vent and look down the vent with a mirror and flashlight or a digital camera. If the ducts are covered with dust or debris, it's time for a heating and cooling system cleaning.\n\nNADCA recommends a thorough duct cleaning, as well as cleaning the evaporator coil and all parts of the system that air touches. Not only will this clean up the air inside your house, but it will also help your system work more efficiently and save you money. A study taken by Pacific Gas and Electric showed that a dirty condenser coil can result in 30 percent higher energy usage.

{"text":"Even though people get hurt by poor indoor air quality, they are also the ones who cause it. Unlike cattle and termites, humans do not directly emit toxic gases that contribute to indoor air pollution (cattle and termites give off methane which is a flammable gas). Through the process of breathing, we do give off carbon dioxide; but this is not usually a health threat unless it is in very high concentrations as would be seen in confined spaces such as in an enclosed submarine with inadequate ventilation or air scrubbers. Though humans give off odors which some might find unpleasant, these are not toxic. Ventilation has historically been used to minimize these odors in a building used by many people.\n\nWays Humans Can Be Harmful to the Indoor Air Environment\n\nDecisions: Making the right or wrong decisions can make all the difference. This begins as early as the design of the building and its construction. Problems at these early stages can have long-lasting consequences. For example:\n\nWas the ventilation system chosen adequate and appropriate for the type of home or building?\n\nWhat type of building materials went into construction?\n\nIs the home or building adequately sealed to prevent moisture problems?\n\nActivities: The activities that we conduct inside our homes and buildings can contribute to indoor air pollution. For example, in an office environment just using laser printers and photocopying machines can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone and particulates into the air. Activities like housekeeping can contribute to poor indoor air quality because of the cleaning chemicals used and because of the dust that is stirred up or goes through vacuum cleaner bags. Indoor hobbies may also involve substances that cause indoor air pollution.\n\nInfections: We are at the greatest risk of getting bacterial or viral infections from other people. Many times these infections are spread from person to person in the air through breathing air into which an infected person as sneezed, breathed, or coughed."}

{"text":"Hold your breath: Europe's deadly transport regime\n\nby Benoit Blondel\n\n30 November 2012\n\nEurope's transport regime is killing its citizens but cycling-friendly policies and funding can reverse this trend \u2013 argues campaigner\n\nYou would be surprised just how dangerous air pollution is in Europe. A new report from the European Environment Agency shows that in many countries, air is simply becoming too toxic to breathe. Harmful nitrogen dioxide and particulate matters have been found to exceed limits in more than a third of testing areas. You may be wondering what these substances are.\n\nWell, they are not nice. According to the EEA: \"These pollutants can affect the cardiovascular system, lungs, liver, spleen and blood.\" It would appear that transport has become a dangerous game. Air pollution from traffic kills some 200,000 people per year in the European Union. Add noise pollution to the equation and you are looking at another 250,000 deaths.\n\nSo what is causing all this toxic air? Part of the problem undoubtedly lies in cars. Private car use has stayed more or less steady despite the economic downturn and wide fuel price fluctuations over the last decade. And even more worryingly, buying a car has become steadily cheaper in real terms since the mid-1990s, while train travel and passenger transport by water has become more expensive.\n\nYet as it currently stands, transport policy at the EU level is not yet brave enough to change the way we move. It is still bent on technological solutions such as e-cars and fuel efficiency. These solutions can only go so far. \"The application of technology has been the primary means of reducing the environmental impacts of transport in the last two decades,\" explains Alfredo S\u00e1nchez Vicente, a transport expert at EEA.\n\n\"But it is clear that measures for reducing the impact of transport emissions and noise can be either technical or non-technical. Action to reduce emissions - greenhouse gases, air pollutants and noise - from vehicles through shifting to alternative modes, the 'shift' principle, and to cleaner fuels and improved vehicle technology, the 'improve' principle, should be complemented by better managing transport demand - the 'avoid' principle. Growing transport demand negates many of the benefits of technology development.\"\n\nIn other words, technology will not be able to save the day. We are going to have to think about changing the way people move if we want a cleaner more sustainable Europe. According to the EEA, bicycles should be an important tool for cleaning up the transport sector. \"Non-motorised transport can and should play a major role in improving the quality of life of Europeans,\" explains Vincente. \"The challenge is to remove barriers to commuting by bicycle, including cultural and infrastructural barriers, but also in terms of safety.\n\n\"We know that its use is exponential: the more bikes on the road, the more pleasant and less dangerous it is to commute by bike, and more infrastructure becomes available. All administration levels need to help trigger this positive cycle.\" Indeed, more bicycles in the transport mix could be a godsend. But it is going to take time and investment. People will not cycle if they do not feel safe and to feel safe they need adequate infrastructure. The real reason the Dutch cycle is because the the government spends on average \u20ac25 per head on cycling polcies.\n\nGovernments often do not give enough money to cycling because people tend to cycle short distances. While many policy-makers see this as a limitation, they should see it as an opportunity. Driving a car on a short trip is kind of like using a 12 tonne lorry to deliver a loaf of bread: it is horribly inefficient. During the first three kilometres of a car trip, exhaust emissions are more than 50 times higher per kilometre due to urban traffic conditions and a cold engine.\n\nWith 30 per cent of motoring trips being shorter than three kilometres, that is a lot of unnecessary toxins being pumped out into the air. At the end of the day, getting more people cycling is not a question of liking bicycles or not. It is a question of creating cities where people can actually live. Being able to breathe clean air should not be a privilege.\n\nYOUR COMMENT WILL BE APPROVED BY A MODERATOR HTML CODE IS NOT PERMITTED.\n\nI have cycled to work daily since 1970. And I drive an LGV 44 tonne, delivering things we consume. I have been concerned for some time at where we all will end up. Doing things to help more people live longer is not the answer. Quite simply, there are too many of us. Let people die of their own poisoning and greed. Those who have been helpful in their way do it quietly. Paul - Nottingham, UK"}

Since its inception in 1995 as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the EPA's Acid Rain program has earned widespread acclaim due to dramatic SO2 and NOX emission reductions that are saving American lives and ecosystems. An analysis estimates annual public health benefits of the program in 2010 alone at more than $120 billion, about 40 times the estimated cost.\n\nSome of the major accomplishments of the program through 2009 include:\n\nPower plants have decreased emissions of SO2, a precursor to acid rain, to 5.7 million tons in 2009, a 67 percent decrease from 1980 levels and a 64 percent decrease from 1990 levels.\n\nAir quality has improved; the average amount of ambient SO2 decreased 76 percent between 1980 and 2009.

{"text":"\u2022 Atmospheric pollution by radium from fireworks can create \"negative health effects\" for people who inhale the \"potential radioactive hazard,\" said a 2009 study out of the Vienna University of Technology. Research in Italy found that fireworks are a \"huge source of gaseous pollutants such as ozone, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides\" but also acknowledged that they \"unlikely pose a significant health hazard.\"\n\n\u2022 The San Diego regional board said water monitoring near SeaWorld showed elevated pollutant levels after major fireworks shows. Pollutants such as arsenic, copper, mercury, tin, zinc and phosphorous were detected at levels above water quality criteria or higher than other spots, according to a 2011 report. It also said related sediment monitoring for metals \"provides an indication of an accumulation of pollutants over time within the fireworks fallout area.\"\n\nBut the agency acknowledged that it's difficult to draw any conclusions about the level of actual ecological harm from Sea World's pyrotechnics, and park officials maintain there's no damage.\n\nDespite such debate, the water board set a national precedent last year by requiring a \"minor discharge\" pollution permit for fireworks over bays, rivers, lakes and other waterways. Related research is supposed to better define the movement of pyrotechnic particles through the environment.\n\nIn addition, the Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation in Encinitas is pushing San Diego to review fireworks shows under the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA \u2014 a measure the city is fighting in court.\n\nFoundation lawyer Marco Gonzalez said the CEQA review is important because it would be much broader than assessments by the regional board, which focus on water.\n\n\"CEQA requires consideration of alternatives, disclosure of impacts and mitigation of impacts when feasible, that doesn't necessarily happen in the (water board) context,\" Gonzalez said. \"Further, the Clean Water Act \u2026 doesn't deal with marine mammals. It doesn't deal with birds. It doesn't deal with air quality. It doesn't deal with noise.\"\n\nSo far, neither the State Water Board nor other regional boards around California have followed San Diego by mandating pollution permits for fireworks over water, meaning the issue might not have the regulatory reach that some initially anticipated. Nor has the issue caught fire across the country, said Robert Blake, president of the National Fireworks Association. \"We haven't heard anything anywhere (about environmental regulations) except in San Diego,\" he said.\n\nBlake said manufacturers have tried to use less-toxic chemicals when possible, but he doesn't see it as a big issue. \"The time of the exposure to the small amounts of chemicals that are there \u2026 is very minimal,\" he said. \"Most of the chemicals are burned up during the explosions.\"\n\nEven so, there's been interest worldwide in developing environmentally friendly fireworks. Organizers of the La Jolla show said they have looked into perchlorate-free fireworks and found that they don't come in as many colors as they wanted. But officials in India reportedly have turned to smokeless firecrackers to celebrate Diwali, and the U.S. Department of Defense has sponsored efforts to develop eco-friendly alternatives for signal flares \u2014 all part of the larger movement to minimize the spread of pollutants."}
{"text":"Post navigation\n\nChina suffering from rising nitrogen emissions\n\nNature: China's air pollution woes are quickly becoming critical, due in large part to increased nitrogen emissions from agriculture, industry, and transportation. The full extent of the problem only recently came to light because of a study by Zhang Fusuo of the China Agricultural University in Beijing and colleagues in which they analyzed data collected over the past 30 years from some 270 monitoring sites around the country. They found that between 1980 and 2010 the amount of nitrogen deposition increased by 60% and that plants were absorbing up to 33% more nitrogen than they were in 1980. The researchers also found that nitrogen emissions from transportation and industry are increasing more rapidly than those from agriculture. China is not the only country suffering from rising nitrogen pollution, however: Worldwide, about 140 million tons of nitrogen is being emitted every year, which is affecting the climate, the environment, and public health."}
{"text":"More than 99.9% of the Earth's atmosphere is made up of the gases nitrogen, oxygen and argon. The trace gas ozone only occurs in very small quantities. While nitrogen and oxygen are vertically (at right angles to the Earth's surface) equally distributed, the distribution of ozone varies with height and reaches its maximum amount (concentration) at around 20 km, in the stratosphere. The normal atmosphere reaches up to about 120km above the Earth's surface, and pressure reduces exponentially with height. If one were to take the whole air-mass over a particular area on the Earth's surface and press it so that was all under the same pressure as the air at ground level, then that air would take up a space 8km high. Of these 8km, ozone would make up only 3mm! It is in this way that the amount of ozone in the atmosphere is described. The units are called Dobson units (DU): 300 DU mean 3mm of the air column is made up of ozone. Ozone is a relation of oxygen. It is made of three oxygen atoms (O3)\n,unlike the oxygen we breathe and which plays an important role in the burning process, which is made of two oxygen atoms. Ozone is produced when oxygen (O2) is broken up into its atoms (O) by high-energy solar radiation, of wavelengths below 240 nanometers. (1000000000 nanometer (nm) is the same as one meter.) O3 protects the Earth's surface from harmful sun rays. Ozone absorbs above all radiation from the sun which lies in the UV-B region: (280-315 nm wavelength) and through this absorption is split up again into an oxygen atom and an oxygen molecule.\n\nThe picture shows two ways of looking at the vertical distribution of ozone. The solid line represents the ratio of ozone as a volume. One takes for example one cubic metre of air and compares the number of all the particles within that volume with the number of ozone particles, or molecules. So 1 ppmv (parts per million volume) means 1 ozone molecule in one million air molecules. But, the total number of molecules in that volume reduces with increasing height because of the reduction in air pressure. The volume mixing ratio (VMR) is therefore a relative term, always related to the air. If one wants to talk about the total number of particles at a particular height, one uses the \"particle number density\", or concentration. This tells you how many particles of one sort (like ozone) are in a certain volume, e.g. 1 cubic centimetre. This is shown by the dotted line. The units\nare not shown here though because ozone concentration is only to serve as an illustration. The most ozone (the highest concentration) is found about 20km above the Earth, and between about 15 and 35km lies the ozone layer, with high ozone concentrations. Under and over it are much lower ozone concentrations. The mixing ratio is important to judge where the most ozone is to be found. Because ozone increases compared to air until about 40km height, one can assume that the most ozone is produced at 40km. There, there are 345 DU of ozone. This is a normal value for the ozone layer.\n\nOzone Formation\n\nIllustration: The formation of ozone from oxygen in the stratosphere.\nIllustration Source: IUP Bremen\n\nOxygen atoms are shown in the illustration as blue balls. When atoms are bonded to form moleclues, they are shown overlying one another. Sunlight is symbolised by yellow waves.\n\nOzone is produced in small quantities from oxygen (O2) when the sun shines. The illustration shows in a simplified form what happens in the stratosphere. When very short-wavelength ultra-violet light (< 240 nm) hits an oxygen (O2) molecule, it is split into two single oxygen atoms (O), in a process called photolysis. These very reactive oxygen atoms can react with other oxygen molecules to form ozone (O3). The air is warmed up by this process.\n\nHere, the reaction in the air is presented in a more lively manner. The UV-light is symbolised by violet flashes, which split the oxygen molecule (O2) into two O atoms. The free O atoms each pair themselves up with another oxygen molecule, to form tri-atomic ozone (O3) molecules. These ozone molecules can also be split up again by the ultra-violet light.\n\nDestruction: The destructive reactions of ozone in the stratosphere\nIllustration Source: IUP Bremen\n\nOzone itself can be photolysed with weak ultra-violet light and even with light from the range of wavelengths which can be seen by the human eye. From the splitting of ozone, oxygen molecules (O2) and atoms (O) are produced again. The atomic oxygen can collide with another ozone molecule and split it up, to produce two oxygen molecules.\n\nThe reactions of ozone synthesis and photolysis occur very quickly. This means ozone is produced quickly and then destroyed quickly, and that the sunlight is absorbed quickly, and therefore effectively. During this process, a lot of heat is produced so the stratosphere warms up. Because the air is very thin at high altitudes, it is easier to warm up than air from lower layers. At higher altitudes there is not so much oxygen available for this reaction to take place. As for lower layers, the photolysis of oxygen is dependent on the availability of very short-wave sunlight and in lower layers of the stratosphere there is a shortage of the necessary short wavelength light because much of it is absorbed higher up in the atmosphere. These are the reasons for the existence of the ozone layer and the increase of temperature with height.\n\nAre there other ways to destroy ozone?\n\nThe mechanisms described above are the natural ways of producing and destroying ozone. But, in the stratosphere there are also other gases such as water vapour, nitrogen oxide and chlorine-containing compounds, which can destroy ozone.\n\nAnother mechanism is responsible for the famous Antarctic ozone hole. It involves reactions which occur on stratospheric ice crystals.\n\nIllustration: The ozone hole over the Antarctic in 1979 and 2000.\nIllustration Source: IUP Bremen\n\nA Summary:\n\nOzone is a tri-atomic form of normally two-atomic oxygen. Both the formation and the natural destruction of ozone occur through the splitting (photolysis) of oxygen or ozone molecules by high-energy UV sunlight. Ozone makes up about 3mm (300 Dobson units, or DU) of the total air column. The main part of this is found in the stratosphere between 20 and 35 km (ozone layer)."}

{"text":"Asian Monsoons Spread Pollutants\n\nLiveScience Staff\n\nDate: 25 March 2010 Time: 09:36 AM ET\n\nThe economic growth in Asia in recent years has meant more\npollution coming from the continent, and, according to a new study, that\npollution is being wafted up into higher layers of the atmosphere during the\nAsian monsoons, which makes it longer-lived in the air.\n\nThis finding, detailed in the March 25 online issue of the\njournal Science, suggests that the impact of Asian pollutants on the\nstratosphere could increase in coming decades because of the growing\nindustrial activity in China and other rapidly developing nations.\n\nWilliam Randel, of the National Center for Atmospheric\nResearch (NCAR), and his colleagues suspected that the seasonal Asian monsoons\nmight funnel air from the lower layer of the atmosphere, called the\ntroposphere, to the layer above it, called the stratosphere. Such a mechanism\ncould explain satellite measurements showing anomalous levels of stratospheric\nozone, water vapor, and other chemicals over Asia during the summer. (A monsoon\nis a seasonal shift in the wind that tends to bring some rainy, violent weather\nwith it.)\n\nThe team used a chemical called hydrogen cyanide \u2014 produced\nlargely as a result of the burning of trees and other vegetation \u2014 as a way to\ntrace the movement of parcels of air during the Northern Hemisphere summer\nmonths.\n\nThe team examined satellite measurements, which detected\nsignificant amounts of hydrogen cyanide throughout the lower atmosphere and up\ninto the stratosphere over the monsoon region. Furthermore, satellite records\nfrom 2004 to 2009 showed a pattern of increases in the chemical's presence in\nthe stratosphere each summer, correlating with the timing of the monsoon.\n\nThe observations also showed hydrogen cyanide, which can\nlast in the atmosphere for several years before breaking down into other\nchemicals, moving over the tropics with other pollutants, including ones that\ncontribute to acid rain and impact ozone levels, and then circulating\nglobally.\n\nThe researchers then used computer modeling to simulate the\nmovement of hydrogen cyanide and pollutants, such as black\ncarbon, sulfur dioxides, and nitrous oxides, from other sources, including\nindustrial activity. The model indicated that emissions of pollutants over a\nbroad region of Asia, from India to China and Indonesia, were becoming stuck in\nthe monsoon circulation and transported into the lower part of the stratosphere.\n\nOnce in the stratosphere, the pollutants circulate around\nthe globe for several years. Some eventually descend back into the lower\natmosphere, while others break down.\n\n\"The monsoon is one of the most powerful atmospheric\ncirculation systems on the planet, and it happens to form right over a heavily\npolluted region,\" Randel, the lead author of the study, said. \"As a\nresult, the monsoon provides a pathway for transporting pollutants up to the\nstratosphere.\"\n\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation,\nNCAR's sponsor, together with NASA and the Canadian Space Agency."}

Examples include napthalene (2 rings), phenanthrene\/anthracene (3 rings), pyrene (4 rings) and one of the most studied, benzo[a]pyrene, has 5 rings. In ambient air they are found either as gases or associated with particles, produced from the incomplete combustion of carbon based fuels such as coal, oil, wood, gas, and petroleum fuels. Fossil-fueled power stations, industrial processes (e.g. aluminium production), domestic burning of fossil fuels and traffic, particularly in urban areas, are the main sources of PAHs in outdoor air. Cigarette smoke is an important source of PAHs in indoor air. Levels of individual PAHs are monitored in outdoor air, but they are always present with other PAHs as part of a complex mixture. Therefore, people are always exposed to a number of different PAHs, rather than single PAHs on their own.\n\nSome PAHs have been shown to be toxic and\/or carcinogenic (cancer-causing)in animals and this information is used to determine the risk to humans. For example, benozo[a]pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, dibenz[ah]anthracene are classified by the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) as 'probably carcinogenic to humans'. As PAHs can be inhaled into the lungs as gases or attached to particles, there is the risk of lung cancer. For example, increased incidence of lung cancer has been observed in men working in gas and coke production and aluminium refining who were exposed to high concentrations of PAH fumes over long periods of time.\n\nLevels of PAHs in outdoor air are much lower than those encountered in occupational settings and there is no convincing evidence, as yet, to suggest that PAHs in outdoor air are a significant cause of lung cancer in the general population. Estimating the health effects due to PAHs in outdoor air is made difficult by cigarette smoking, which is a source of PAHs in itself, and which can obscure contributions from outdoor sources in population studies."}

{"text":"How to Control Your Home's Indoor Air Quality\n\nHomes today are being built tight to conserve energy. But, by sealing up the house there is very little fresh air coming in. Improving ventilation and installing air cleaners are practical ways that you can control the quality of your home's indoor air.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been studying the problem of indoor air pollution and has issued a number of recommendations on how to keep your home safe. Running the vacuum regularly and dusting are practical ways to eliminate potential threats. Proper ventilation in bathrooms and kitchens is also recommended to vent excess moisture from showering and cooking. The EPA also advises not to permit smoking in your home and to store paints and pesticides outside of your living quarters.\n\nSometimes installing an exhaust fan is not sufficient to improve ventilation in the home. You may need an exchange unit which brings in clean air from the outside as it forces the stale air out. Some of these units can also retain hot or cool air and act as a dehumidifier to eliminate moisture. A T.F. O'Brien technician can determine what size unit would be appropriate for your home. This is also an excellent time to consider installing an electronic air cleaner which will do a much better job of removing contaminants from the air than the typical furnace filter.\n\nOur goal is to help educate our customers about energy and home comfort issues (specific to HVAC systems).

{"text":"The health effects of particulate matter in the air can be quite serious.\n\nTHANKS to the volcanic ash cloud that hangs over Europe, my wife cannot come back from her work visit to Europe. We know what volcanic ash can do to the engines of aeroplanes. But do these particles have any impact on our health when we breathe them in?\n\nLet's talk about particles or particulate matter in general, seeing as we have no active volcanoes in Malaysia. (Though we may be affected if a volcano in Indonesia erupts.)\n\nParticulates or fine particles are tiny subsets of solid or liquid materials which are suspended in either a gas (like air) or liquid (like water). When you have particulates suspended in gas, we call it aerosol.\n\nParticulates can either remain solid when suspended, or dissolve in the liquid it is suspended in. Example, salt dissolves in water. But ash will remain as solid in the same water.\n\nParticulates in the air are responsible for causing diseases in the hearts and lungs.\n\nDo these particulates always come from natural disasters like volcanoes?\n\nNo. Particulates can come from natural sources or man-made sources.\n\nNatural sources include volcanoes, forest fires (like with the haze), dust storms, and sand storms. Some even come from vegetation, such as when the wind blows fine pollen from the grass. Some even come from the sea.\n\nBut humans are also responsible for a lot of the particulates in the atmosphere. Burning, for example, spews a lot of particulates into the air. Industrial plants that let out a lot of effusions from their smoke stacks and diesel engines from trucks and cars also contribute.\n\nIt is estimated that 10% of particulate matter in the world's air come from human activities.\n\nWhat types of particulates are there floating in the air? How big are they? Can we see them? Do they block out light?\n\nParticulates are usually classified by size. A particulate can be as large as 10 micrometers or as tiny as below 100 nanometers. The latter are called ultrafine particles.\n\nWe can definitely see them if they blanket out the sky, e.g. the haze, volcanic ash clouds.\n\nThe effects on the climate are very bad. Particulates can affect climate directly by absorbing solar and infrared radiation from the atmosphere. When they absorb too much, a critical point is reached when they start to change from cooling down our atmosphere to heating it.\n\nIndirectly, they cause more condensation of water and increase cloud size.\n\nThe eruption of a Russian volcano, for example, in the early 17th century, caused the Russian famine of 1601 to 1603, leading to two million deaths from starvation.\n\nWhat types of diseases can particulates cause?\n\nThe size of the particulate determines where in our respiratory tract the particle will finally rest, and what type of disease it can cause.\n\nThe larger the particle, the less effect it has on health. Larger particles are filtered by our nose hairs, then by the cilia in our tracheas, But the smaller ones \u2013 less than 10 micrometers \u2013 can penetrate to our bronchi and our alveoli (air sacs) in our lungs.\n\nAnd the really small ones \u2013 less than 2.5 micrometers \u2013 can penetrate into the barrier between the alveoli sacs and blood. These tiny particles can also lead to plaque deposits in our arteries themselves. This process is called artherosclerosis, where our arteries harden with deposits to become inflexible and inelastic, leading to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nIn fact, researchers have found that even short-term exposure to these tiny ultrafine particles can cause significant artherosclerosis.\n\nNow it has been found that really tiny particles of less than 100 nanometers can cross through our cell membranes and be transported into our organs, such as the brain. There are theories that this is one of the causes of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIt is recorded that particulate pollution is the cause of up to 52,000 deaths per year in the US.\n\nI have heard a lot of bad things about diesel engines. Do they produce particulates?\n\nYes, and unfortunately, the particulate size produced here (called Diesel Particulate Matter) is the in the range of 100 nanometers, one of the smallest, leading to diseases mentioned above.\n\nThe main contaminant here is sulphur dioxide.\n\nNot only that, these particles carry carcinogens, or materials that cause cancer, such as benzopyrene, arsenic, and formaldehyde.\n\nNote that even the shape of the particle can be dangerous. Asbestos particulates are shaped like feathers, and are more dangerous than rounded particulates. They lodge in our lungs and can give rise to asbestosis and the dangerous complication of mesothelioma, a pleural lining cancer.\n\nNote that the diesel exhaust fumes itself can cause irritation to our eyes, nose, throat and lungs, leading to increased asthma attacks.\n\nDr YLM graduated as a medical doctor, and has been writing for many years on various subjects such as medicine, health advice, computers and entertainment.

{"text":"Caddo ozone levels reach EPA's limit\n\nParish faces non-attainment\n\nIt's hard to escape ozone pollution. The pollutant is caused from our cars, industrial emissions and much more. Caddo Parish Public Works Engineer Ken Ward says the parish's ozone rates have gone beyond the federal limit, which will cause the EPA to label us a non-attainment area. That should enact laws to help lower ozone but has consequences Ward believes will harm local business.\n\n\"We'll have to have air permits,\" Ward said. \"Any new businesses that come into the area will have to have an air permit. Dry cleaners, gas stations, even tanning beds will all have to have permits, and have things installed in their equipment to keep ozone emissions down.\"\n\nWard claims our ozone pollution is mostly caused by chemicals released from pine trees, not emissions. He says parish officials spoke to leaders in Washington D.C. about keeping Caddo Parish from reaching non-attainment because of that.\n\n\"Discussed with them how we can think about trying to change the definition of ozone to help keep us out of non-attainment,\" Ward said. \"I mean, what do we have a choice to do? Change the definition or cut down the pine trees?\"\n\nHowever, Ward says some in D.C. are trying to lower the federal ozone limit. Caddo Parish might not be able to avoid non-attainment.\n\n\"Currently, our ozone is set at 75 parts per million,\" Ward said. \"We fell in at 76 parts per million. They're looking to reduce that 75 parts per million to somewhere in the 60 range, which we're at 76. So, we have a long way to go to try not to make that non-attainment.\"\n\nOzone isn't directly emitted into the atmosphere but is caused by chemical reactions between emissions and other compounds in the air. The EPA says ozone can be harmful to lung function and is most dangerous to children. Pollution levels peak during the summer months.\n\nCopyright 2013 KTBS.

Enck said the EPA is collaborating with the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York to study harmful air pollution in Tonawanda and review pollution causes and possible remedies.\n\n\"The purpose of that grant is for this very impressive community group to work with local business leaders, elected officials, community groups and members of the public, to figure out ways to drive down the levels of pollution in Tonawanda, New York,\" said Enck.\n\nAlthough Tonawanda Coke on River Road has often been cited as, perhaps, the worst air polluter, Enck noted there are dozens of other plants facilities in the town that also contribute to the air pollution problem.\n\n\"You may be familiar with Tonawanda Coke, that the EPA and State of New York has brought environmental law enforcement actions against, but there are 53 companies that hold air permits within a two mile area of Tonawanda,\" said Enck.\n\nSenator Charles Schumer has issued a statement, applauding the EPA for selecting the Town of Tonawanda for the $100.000 grant.\n\nThe goal of the federal grant is to work with the companies in Tonawaanda in getting them to focus on the amount of toxic chemicals they use and the amount of pollution they are emitting into the air and water, and become more sustainable and cleaner."}
{"text":"Under the Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for various air pollutants, ozone included.\n\nBut their latest ruling on ozone is riddled in controversy, as opponents state it is not only unsupported by scientific evidence but also set to cost the United States dearly in the form of a trillion dollars and millions of lost jobs.\n\nWhat's the New Ozone Standard All About?\n\nIn 2009, the EPA decided it would reconsider the ozone standard, which was set at 0.075 parts per million (ppm) in 2008. In 2010, they proposed a new standard in the range of 0.060 to 0.070 ppm, with an additional secondary \"seasonal\" (and even more stringent) standard designed to protect sensitive vegetation and ecosystems, including forests, parks, wildlife refuges and wilderness areas during the summer.\n\nThe final rule was released at the end of July 2011i after a temporary delay.At the time, opponents like Andrew Grossman, a frequent adviser to Congress on complex legal and policy issues, had rejoiced, statingii :\n\n\"Congress should make the EPA's temporary postponement of its new ozone standards a permanent one.\"\n\nIn the end, the EPA set the new ozone standard at 0.070 ppm. Why all the backlash over what seems on face value to be a positive move for health and the environment?\n\nQuestionable Science: Are Ozone Risks Exaggerated?\n\nMost of you have probably heard of ozone before, likely in relation to its role as an air pollutant. But you should know that ozone is not inherently bad, nor dangerous. It is actually the way that nature cleans and removes pollutants naturally from the air outside.\n\nOzone is simply an oxygen molecule with an extra atom attached\u2026 the chemical symbol is O3\u2026 the extra oxygen atom makes it a somewhat aggressive oxidizer. Why is the extra oxygen atom important? The interesting thing about ozone is that it uses this extra ozone to decimate air pollution. Once it oxidizes an air pollutant, it loses one of its oxygen atoms and turns back into pure oxygen (O2).\n\nIt is true that ozone in excessively high levels can cause breathing trouble, but the part that is never mentioned is that you breathe ozone every day, and that's just fine. It's a normal part of your air supply, and a normal part of earth's atmosphere. It is only when ozone levels are excessive that health problems can occur. After all, even water and sunlight are harmful in excess.\n\nIs the EPA's Ozone Standard Based on Flawed Science?\n\nThe EPA's suggested revision to the ozone NAAQS appears to be based on flawed science. As a report by NERA Economic Consulting revealed:\n\n\"EPA's statements on health benefits from lowering the Ozone NAAQS grossly misrepresent what EPA is actually estimating as the potential benefits of reducing public exposures to ozone. If based on ozone benefits alone, not one of EPA's estimates of the benefits of reducing ozone to a tighter alternative ozone standard is as large as the costs of attaining that respective ozone standard -- all cost more than the ozone benefits they might provide.\"\n\nAccording to the report:\n\n* The EPA has included ozone reduction benefits based on ozone-related mortality, even though EPA's science advisors found no \"causal\" link between ozone and mortality * The EPA has included benefits from concomitant reductions in particulate matter (PM) that may occur while reducing ozone precursors. Particulate matter is an entirely different issue from ozone, and describes particles in the air, such as dust, dirt, soot, smoke and other toxins from diesel fumes and other sources.\n\nAs the report stated:\n\n\"The only way EPA finds benefits greater than costs for a tighter ozone standard is to add in health gains from concomitant reductions in PM2.5 that may occur while reducing ozone precursors -- \"co-benefits\" that have nothing to do with ozone exposures. Thus, EPA's claim that tightening the Ozone NAAQS has greater benefits than costs has nothing to do with reducing risks from ozone.\"\n\nGrossman further expanded on the EPA's decision to include particulate matter in with their ozone analysis:\n\n\"The biggest purported benefits\u2014alleged to be worth tens of billions of dollars per year\u2014have to do not with ozone but with reductions in airborne particulate matter that would supposedly be achieved by the emissions controls required to meet a new ozone standard. This claim is speculative, because the \"unknown technologies\" necessary to comply may or may not achieve these reductions.\n\nMoreover, the EPA claims these same benefits for its rule on interstate air pollution, its massively expensive Utility MACT proposal, and its NAAQS for fine particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. If a private entity followed the EPA's lead and quintuple-counted profits, its executives would wind up in prison.\"\n\nThere are other questionable aspects to the EPA's new NAAQS as well. For instance, the stricter standard is based on a controversial re-analysis of two small studies. As Grossman states:\n\n\"The EPA's re-analysis has proven controversial and been criticized by the two studies' author and other scientists. For example, CASAC [Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee] member Dr. Sverre Vedal of the University of Washington stated that the EPA's re-analysis \"amounts to attempting to find effects in a very few individuals when the statistical tests are not significant.\" And former CASAC chair Roger McClellan testified, 'The validity of this re-interpretation and the significance of the functional changes is open to debate.'\"\n\nThe standard is also moving closer to background levels that exist naturally in the environment, making it difficult if not possible to attain in some areas. The costs are going to be extraordinary no matter what, with one study by Manufacturers Alliance\/MAPI suggesting the stricter ozone standard could cost the U.S. economy more than $1 trillion per year from 2020 to 2030 while cutting 7.3 million jobs.\n\nNatural Ozone is Safe\n\nMuch of the misunderstanding surrounding ozone has been spewed by the commercial industry, including manufacturers of ozone-free air purifiers who have used negative marketing to their advantage, jumping on the ozone-will-kill-you bandwagon in an attempt to skewer the competition. But ozone is a natural component of the earth's atmosphere, considered by many scientists to be nature's method for cleaning the air we breathe.\n\nOzone is:\n\n* Made in nature by ultra violet (UV) energy from the sun striking oxygen molecules * Created by lightning \u2013 The fresh air you smell after a thunderstorm is due to the ozone cleaning effect on the air. * A component of ground-level air wherever you go on the earth \u2013 Such has been the case since the beginning of time.\n\nAt the appropriate natural levels like you find outside on a non-polluted day, ozone is not only effective, it's naturally safe \u2026 typical levels run 0.01 to 0.05 ppm. This is why, when it comes to ozone air purifiers, as long as they limit ozone levels in your home to between 0.02 and 0.04 ppm, they offer great health benefits, without any of the negative effects.\n\nOzone Purifiers are Also Very Safe if Used Correctly\n\nIt is important to understand that air purifiers incorporating ozone use an active process and do not physically capture any indoor air pollutants. Rather they generate a safe dose of ozone that will oxidize and permanently remove the pollutants just the way they do outdoors in Mother Nature.\n\nWhen it comes to air purification units for your home, the EPA has established clear ozone limits for occupied spaces \u2026 and that's 0.05 ppm. And this establishment by the EPA seems to make a great deal of sense since typical levels outdoors are present at 0.05 ppm and are still considered safe.\n\nSo there is no reason to be fearful of ozone, as it is safe at natural levels and actually used in nature to oxidize pollutants and clean the air.\n\nYou certainly do not want to expose yourself to high levels of man-made ozone, that is, the ozone the EPA calls \"ground-level\" ozone that is formed when two types of pollutants (volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen) react in the presence of sunlight. This ozone is a direct product of industry, motor vehicles, and toxic consumer products like paints and cleaners, and may cause breathing trouble, lung damage and other health effects with continued exposure.\n\nIf ozone were not safe, you would not be able to breathe the air outside, especially on a clear sunny day; during a thunderstorm, lightning, or after a rain shower. The fact is, when used responsibly, ozone is very safe, just like oxygen, and is very beneficial to our planet and all living things on it.\n\nIf you are interested in an extensive reference of scientific articles about ozone's medical uses, refer to this list, compiled by Ed McCabe. And finally, if you are interested in making the air you breathe on a daily basis in your home and office cleaner, you can find 15 of my top strategies here.\n\nReferences:\n\n* i EPA Final National Ambient Air Quality Standard for Ozone, July 2011 * ii The Heritage Foundation August 1, 2011\n\n\"...my eyes beheld the 'BOOK OF MORMON'\u2014that book of books \u2026 which was the principal means, in the hands of God, of directing the entire course of my future life.\" - Parley Pratt\n\nYour fasting insulin level reflects how healthy your blood glucose levels are over time. Insulin helps sugar move from your blood into your cells, where it can be used or stored. Chronically elevated blood glucose leads to insulin resistance and numerous chronic diseases, including diabetes and heart disease. Elevated blood glucose and insulin resistance are epidemic today. An estimated one in four Americans are either insulin resistant or diabetic.\n\nOne of the most frequent causes of elevated glucose (and insulin resistance) is consumption of too many grains and sugars. Fructose has been shown to be especially harmful due to the way it disrupts the lock-and-key fit between insulin and its cellular receptor sites. Fructose is a powerful endocrine disruptor, capable of rapidly inducing insulin resistance when consumed in what, by today's standards, is a relatively small amount (25 grams or more per day)..\n\nYou can also use a simple glucose test to check your fasting glucose level. Just realize that it's possible to have low fasting glucose but still have significantly elevated insulin levels.Generally speaking, a fasting glucose under 100 mg\/dl suggests you're not insulin resistant, while a level between 100 and 125 suggests you're either mildly insulin resistant or have impaired glucose tolerance (sometimes referred to as pre-diabetes).\n\n2. Cholesterol\/HDL Ratio\n\nCholesterol has been demonized for the past few decades, thanks to a landmark study by Dr. Ancel Keys in 1953 that has been used to justify a low fat diet approach to achieve health. This study resulted in cholesterol's being blamed for just about every case of heart disease in the last 20 years. But the fact is, cholesterol is most likely not going to destroy your health (as you have been led to believe), and is also not the cause of heart disease. Most of the recent credible science has debunked Keys' theory, but the cholesterol myth stubbornly persists in the mainstream because it's so deeply embedded in our culture.\n\nWe now know that your body actually requires cholesterol to manufacture vitamin D from sunlight, to synthesize sex hormones, and for proper brain function. Measuring total blood cholesterol tells you practically nothing about your heart disease risk. More value can be derived by looking at the relative types of lipids circulating in your bloodstream, and today we have sophisticated tests that can measure these. The following two ratios are far better indicators of heart disease risk than total cholesterol alone:\n\n* Your HDL\/Cholesterol ratio: HDL (high-density lipoproteins) to total cholesterol percentage is a very good predictor of heart disease risk. Just divide your HDL number by your total cholesterol. Ideally, this number should exceed 24 percent; below 10 percent predicts an increased risk for heart disease. * Your Triglyceride\/HDL ratio: Divide your triglyceride number by your HDL. This percentage should ideally be below 2.\n\n3. Percentage Body Fat\n\nBody composition, meaning your relative amounts of lean body mass to body fat, is a powerful way to measure your overall health. There is a strong correlation between higher body fat and negative health outcomes, such as heart disease and stroke. And percentage of body fat says more about your overall fitness than body weight or body mass index (BMI). BMI can be particularly misleading, causing fit bodybuilders to be classified as overweight as it does not take into account the higher weight of muscle compared to fat. Also, increased organ or abdominal adipose tissue in particular (a \"beer belly\") has been shown to be more strongly associated with heart disease and a variety of chronic diseases than just weight in relation to height.\n\nThe most common way to assess body fat percentage is the skinfold measurement technique, which utilizes a skinfold caliper. (Skinfold measurement is the method most widely used by fitness trainers.) The American Council on Exercise provides the following percentage body fat guidelinesii for men and women: Category Women Men Essential Fat 10-13% 2-5% Athletes 14-20% 6-13% Fitness 21-24% 4-17% Acceptable 25-31% 18-24% Obesity >32% >25%\n\nFor even greater accuracy, you can resort to hydrostatic weighing, where you get weighed under water. This measures the density of your body, which is then used to calculate how much body fat you have.\n\nAnother technique that is gaining support by medical and fitness experts is the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). To measure body impedance, an electrical signal is passed through your body. Impedance is greatest in fat tissue, which contains low amounts of water, while fat-free mass, which contains up to 75 percent water, allows the signal to pass through fairly unimpeded. This measurement, along with other factors such as your height, weight, and body type, is then used to calculate your percentage of body fat, fat-free mass and other body composition values. There are now bathroom scales that use this technology. I picked one up from Eat Smartiii that I have been using for the last four months. I find it's a simple way to monitor my body fat percentage. It may overestimate a bit as it has me at 13.5 percent when I tested between 11 and 12 percent using other methods, but it is very accurate in measuring day to day variability, and can be an excellent and inexpensive way to monitor your progress on optimizing your body fat so it is line with your health goals.\n\n4. Serum Ferritin\n\nYou probably already know that iron is an important nutrient for your body. But you might not be aware that iron is a double-edged sword\u2014both too much and too little can lead to major health problems.\n\nIron serves many functions in your body, but one of the most important is carrying oxygen throughout your body by binding to hemoglobin molecules in your bloodstream. Without proper oxygenation, your cells quickly begin to die. If you don't have enough iron in your body, you end up with iron deficiency anemia, a common problem among children and menstruating women. But your body also has a limited capacity to excrete iron, so it can build up in your tissues if you're getting too much in your diet.\n\nProcessed foods fortified with iron and multivitamins with iron can contribute to iron overload over time. The problem with excess iron is that it's also a very potent oxidative stressor, causing dangerous free radicals that can damage your heart and your DNA, and lead to diseases such as cancer. Therefore, you should regularly check yourself for iron overload with a serum ferritin test. This blood test measures iron's carrier molecule\u2014a protein called ferritin found inside your cells upon which the iron is stored. If your ferritin levels are low, it means your iron levels are also low, and vice versa. Use the following guidelines to interpret your serum ferritin level:\n\n* The healthy range of serum ferritin is between 20 and 80 ng\/ml * The ideal serum ferritin range is 40 to 60 ng\/ml * Below 20, you are iron deficient; above 80, you have an iron surplus.Ferritin levels can go really high. I've seen levels over 1,000, but anything over 80 is likely to be a problem.\n\nIt is VITAL to appreciate that about one in five men and postmenopausal women have iron levels that are too high and are actually causing premature disease and death. If you or someone you love has triple digit ferritin levels you need to lower them ASAP. The higher the number the worse it is, with numbers over 250-300 being particularly dangerous. Fortunately there is a very simple way to lower it. I would not advise using supplements like phytic acid (IP6), which can bind other helpful minerals. The single best way to lower your iron is to simply donate blood. If you have risk factors that prevent you from having your blood accepted for donation, you can have your doctor write you a prescription for a therapeutic phlebotomy.\n\n5. Waist Size\n\nThere is scientific evidenceiv that BMI (body mass index) is a very flawed measurement when it comes to predicting your risk of dying from heart disease. Waist size provides a far more accurate benchmark for predicting your risk of death from a heart attack and from other causes. Determining your waist size is easy. With a tape measure, measure the distance around the smallest area of your abdomen, below your rib cage and above your belly button. The following is a general guide for healthy waist circumference:\n\nThe reason why this is a better indicator of heart disease risk is because your waist size is related to the type of fat that is stored around your waistline, called \"visceral fat\" or \"belly fat.\" This type of fat is strongly linked to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and other chronic diseases. It is thought that visceral fat is related to the release of proteins and hormones that cause inflammation, which can in turn damage your arteries and affect how you metabolize sugars and fats. An expanded waistline is associated with insulin resistance, high blood pressure, lipid imbalance, cardiovascular disease, thickening of the walls of your heart, and even increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease decades later.\n\n6. Uric Acid Level\n\nYou may already know that elevated uric acid levels cause gout. But did you know uric acid can serve as a marker for fructose toxicity?\n\nFructose, when over-consumed, is very taxing to your body's metabolic processes. One of the by-products of fructose metabolism is uric acid, so when you consume too much sugar\u2014particularly concentrated fructose\u2014your uric acid levels may rise. Fructose turns you into a uric acid factory! Elevated uric acid is thought to explain much of the damage fructose causes in your body. This is especially pronounced if you are particularly fructose-sensitive, as I am. I'm grateful to Dr. Richard Johnson, author of The Sugar Fix, for bringing the uric acid link to my attention. As an aside I have helped proof his new book, The Fat Switch, which is beyond phenomenal and will also be available shortly.\n\nThe connection between fructose consumption and increased uric acid is so reliable that a uric acid level taken from your blood can actually be used as a marker for fructose toxicity. I now recommend that a uric acid level be a routine part of your blood screening.\n\nAccording to the latest research, the safest range for uric acid is between 3 and 5.5 milligrams per deciliter, and there appears to be a steady relationship between uric acid levels and blood pressure and cardiovascular risk, even down to the range of 3 to 4 mg\/dl. As you know, two-thirds of the U.S. population is overweight, and most of these people likely have uric acid levels in excess of 5.5. Some may even be closer to 10 or higher. Dr. Johnson suggests that the ideal uric acid level is probably around:\n\n* 4 mg\/dl for men, and * 3.5 mg\/dl for women\n\n7. Vitamin D Level\n\nVitamin D deficiency is at epidemic levels in the United States, but many Americans\u2014including many physicians\u2014are still unaware of the implications. In the U.S., the late winter average vitamin D is only about 15 to 18 ng\/ml, which is considered a very serious deficiency state. In fact, 85 percent of Americans may be deficient in vitamin D, including more than 95 percent of all seniors.\n\nVitamin D influences about 3,000 of the 30,000 genes in your body, which is why it's involved with the expression of so many diseases, from cancer to autism to heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis, just to name a few. A study by vitamin D expert Dr. William Grant, Ph.D., found that about 30 percent of cancer deaths could be prevented each year with higher levels of vitamin D. Beyond preventing cancer, researchers have estimated that increasing vitamin D levels could prevent diseases that claim nearly one million lives globally each year. Vitamin D also fights colds and flu because it helps your immune system defend against bacteria and viruses.\n\nYou should regularly check your vitamin D level, but you must obtain the correct test. There are two vitamin D tests: 1,25(OH)D and 25(OH)D. Of the two, 25(OH)D (also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D) is the better marker of overall vitamin D status.\n\nThe following ranges were obtained in a large-scale clinical study by evaluating healthy people in tropical or subtropical parts of the world, where they are receiving healthy sun exposures. It seems more than reasonable to assume that these values are in fact reflective of an optimal human requirement. When getting your vitamin D level tested, please realize that many commercial labs are using old, outdated reference ranges, and that their \"normal\" is likely to be far below these optimal and clinically relevant values.\n\nIf your vitamin D level is too low, the best way to increase it is with exposure to natural sunlight, in appropriate amounts, or using a safe tanning bed. If neither of those options are feasible, you can opt for an oral vitamin D3 supplement. Just remember that if you supplement orally, it is even MORE important to have your blood levels checked regularly, as there is a wide variation in how efficiently people absorb vitamin D orally.\n\nWhile the latest research indicates adults need about 8,000 IU's of vitamin D per day to achieve vitamin D levels of 40 ng\/ml, you need to monitor your levels carefully in order to determine the dosage you need in order to reach and maintain optimal levels, as this is highly variable. There is no magic dosage when it comes to vitamin D; rather it's the serum level that really matters.\n\nFor more information about vitamin D testing, refer to my comprehensive article on the topic. I also strongly recommend you watch my one-hour vitamin D lecture, included at the top of this section.\n\nHoney bees are the angels of agriculture, but they're disappearing at a startling rate in a mysterious phenomenon dubbed Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD).\n\nSince 2007, North American honey bees are literally disappearing without a trace. There are no massive dead bee bodies appearing in or around the hives\u2014the bees are simply GONE, bewildering beekeepers and scientists alike.\n\nIn fact, serious honey bee die-offs have been occurring around the world for the past decade. The U.S. and the U.K. both reported losing a third of their honey bees in 2010.\n\nItaly lost half of theirs.\n\nThe die-offs have spread to China and India, in addition to many other countries. Environmental scientists are concerned that CCD reflects a far more serious problem than pollination\u2014that it's an ominous sign of severe environmental crisis.\n\nBees provide pollination for crops, orchards and flowers, and make honey and wax for cosmetics, food and medicine. One of every three bites of food you eat depends on the honey bee. They pollinate at least 130 different crops in the U.S. alone, including fruits, vegetables and tree nuts.\n\nWithout honey bees, farmers would have to resort to pollinating their crops by hand.\n\nAccording to a recent British report, replacing the pollination of food crops that bees do for free with hand pollination would cost the UK \u00a31.8 billion per year. In the words of Michael Pollan:\n\n\"CCD is one of the signs--the unmistakable signs\u2014that our food system is unsustainable\u2026 It's destroying the conditions upon which it depends. It has internal contradictions that will lead to breakdown.\"\n\nThe documentary film \"Vanishing of the Bees\" takes a piercing investigative look at the economic, political and ecological implications of the worldwide disappearance of the honey bee. Directors George Langworthy and Maryam Henein tell the story of Colony Collapse Disorder, as well as suggesting a platform of solutions. I strongly encourage you to watch this important film, which is being offered here in its entirety, FREE for a limited time.\n\nBusy as a Bee\n\nHoney bees represent one of the matriarchies of the insect kingdom. Colonies consist of one queen, lots and lots of male worker bees and a few male drones. Ninety-five percent of the worker bees are female. A healthy hive is occupied by a collection of overlapping generations. Tasks are divvied up according to age and colony needs via a very intricate system of communication:\n\n* Younger worker bees (nurse bees) tend to the queen and the baby bees. * Older worker bees forage for food and water for the colony, convert nectar into honey, construct wax cells and clean the cells, and guard the hive from invaders. Worker bees develop stingers to defend the eggs lain by the queen. * Drones have only one purpose\u2014to mate with the queen. In fact, the queen will leave her hive only once in her lifetime, in order to mate with several drones and store up enough sperm to last the rest of her life.i\n\nPollination is dependent on insects and the wind, and bees play an essential role. As they buzz around in flight, their hair develops static electricity. When a bee lands on a flower, this static charge attracts pollen to the bee like a magnet. Honey bees from one hive can visit more than 100,000 flowers in a single day\u2014those bees really ARE busy!\n\nWhy are We Losing Our Bees?\n\nScientists have investigated a number of factors to help explain CCD and have offered a variety of explanations. The primary theory seems to be that Colony Collapse Disorder is caused by a variety of imbalances in the environment, secondary to current agricultural and industrial practices.\n\nBees are sensitive to the constant flood of manmade chemicals into their system, especially pesticides, many of which accumulate over time. Honey bee colonies are further stressed by the \"factory farming\" style of beekeeping employed by the commercial bee industry. They are being raised using unnatural practices, artificially inseminated, and fed cheap sugary nectarsubstitutes instead of their natural food.\n\nIt should be noted that the theory of cell phones causing the disappearance of bees has largely been dismissed. This theory reportedly originated from the misinterpretation of a German study, and then spread like wildfire.\n\nQueens are \"Knocked Out and Knocked Up\"\n\nIn nature, queen bees live for up to five years, but workers and drones live for only a few weeks or months. Large commercial bee farms routinely kill the queen bee after only a few months by pinching off her head, and then replace her with a younger, artificially raised queen. In the film, it is suggested that artificial queen breeding is one of the primary factors causing the demise of the colonies.\n\nOrganic beekeepers say that artificial insemination is also to blame. The queen is \"knocked out and knocked up.\" She is sedated with carbon dioxide and inseminated with semen from male drones, selected for traits, which narrows the gene pool.\n\nThe other problem is bee nutrition\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014in the commercial bee industry. Honey, which the bees make from natural rich plant nectar, is taken away from the hives and replaced with sugar syrup, which is completely lacking in nutrition.\n\nAll of these practices stress the honeybees' immune system. Weakened colonies are further stressed by being shipped across country or overseas, multiple times, to pollinate commercial crops\u2014a practice which is unsustainable but made necessary due to dwindling local bee populations. Honeybee colonies are further damaged when they live near areas sprayed with pesticides and planted with GM crops, like Monsanto corn and soy. There is a great deal of evidence that the newer, systemic insecticides are fueling a virtual bee holocaust.\n\nAre Bees Victims of the Agrichemical Industry?\n\nThe newer systemic insecticides, known as neonicotinoids, have become the fastest growing insecticides in the world. Two prominent examples, Imidacloprid and Clothianidin, are used as seed treatments in hundreds of crops.Virtually all of today's genetically engineered Bt corn is treated with neonicotinoids.\n\nBee colonies began disappearing in the U.S. shortly after the EPA allowed these new insecticides on the market. Even the EPA itself admits that \"pesticide poisoning\" is a likely cause of bee colony collapse.\n\nThese insecticides are highly toxic to bees because they are systemic, water soluble, and very pervasive. They get into the soil and groundwater where they can accumulate and remain for many years and present long-term toxicity to the hive. They enter the vascular system of the plant and are carried to all parts of it, as well as to the pollen and nectar. Neonicotinoids affect insects' central nervous systems in ways that are cumulative and irreversible. Even minute amounts can have profound effects over time. And the little bees are being exposed over and over again as pesticides become more necessary due to monoculture.\n\nMonoculture is the growing of just one type of crop on a massive scale and is another variable contributing to CCD as there is no such thing as monoculture in nature!\n\nFarmers used to be diversified\u2026 cows, pigs, chickens, and vegetables could be found on every farm. But today, fields of corn and soy stretch for hundreds of miles. Commercial bee farmers are no exception and have fallen prey to this agricultural model. Pests LOVE monoculture, so massive quantities of pesticides are required to crash the pest party. Beekeepers used to move beehives away from spray zones, but now this is nearly impossible. The chemicals seep into waterways, air, soil, and are incorporated into the plant itself, from the seed on up, as well as into adjacent fields.\n\nHives Now Show Increased Levels of Pesticide Contamination\n\nA Purdue University studyii found multiple sources of pesticide exposure for honey bees living near agricultural fields, including high levels of Clothianidin in agricultural machinery exhaust, in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with Bt corn, and on dandelions growing in those fields. The chemicals were also found in dead bees near hive entrances and in pollen stored in the hives.\n\nABC Newsiiireports:\n\n\"According to the new study, neonicotinoid insecticides 'are among the most widely used in the world, popular because they kill insects by paralyzing nerves but have lower toxicity for other animals.' Beekeepers immediately observed an increase in die-offs right around the time of corn planting using this particular kind of insecticide.\"\n\nJim Frazier from Penn State sampled hives from across the U.S. and found an average six pesticides in each hive, with one hive testing positive for 31 different pesticides, some of which are of the systemic varieties.iv\n\nBut how do we determine if it's the pesticides that are leading to CCD?\n\nWhat makes it so tricky is that bees can display NO symptoms for many months after small pesticide exposures\u2014sub-lethal exposures are hard to detect, in bees as in humans and other animals. Adverse consequences appear much later, making it difficult to connect the dots.\n\nOne of the observed effects of these insecticides is weakening of the bee's immune system.\n\nForager bees bring pesticide-laden pollen back to the hive, where it's consumed by all of the bees. Six months later, their immune systems fail, and they fall prey to natural bee infections, such as parasites, mites, viruses, fungi and bacteria. Indeed, pathogens such as Varroa mites, Nosemav , fungalvi and bacterial infections, and Israeli acute paralysis virusvii (IAPV) are found in large amounts in honey bee hives on the verge of collapse. In addition to immune dysfunction and opportunistic diseases, the honey bees also appear to suffer from neurological problems, disorientation, and impaired navigation.\n\nA bee can't survive for more than 24 hours if she becomes disoriented and unable to find her way back to the hive.\n\nEven our butterfliesviii are suffering at the hands of \"pestitution\"\u2026 to borrow the documentary's clever pun. A decline in the North American monarch butterfly population has been linked to increased plantings of herbicide-tolerant GM crops, and overuse of the herbicide glyphosate, which is the key chemical in Monsanto's Roundup. Glyphosate is killing milkweed plants, upon which monarchs rely for habitat and food.\n\nOrder Vanishing of Bees\n\nPesticides Cause Bees to Lose their Way...\n\nA recent article in Science Newsix highlights the findings of two new bee studies, which found that even when the neonicotinoids don't kill the bees, they tend to lead to \"delayed downturns in bee royalty and a subtle erosion of workforces.\"\n\n\"To simulate pesticide exposures that bumblebees might encounter when a field of canola blooms, entomologist Dave Goulson, of the University of Stirling in Scotland, and his colleagues fed 50 Bombus terrestris lab colonies nonfatal doses of the pesticide imidacloprid. After two weeks of eating spiked pollen and sugar water, bees were set outside and allowed to forage around the Stirling campus at will. By season's end, the pesticide-dosed colonies were an average of 8 percent to 12 percent smaller than 25 unexposed neighbor colonies,\" Science News reports. \"More noticeably, the contaminated colonies managed to produce only about two young queens each. The other colonies averaged about 14.\"\n\nOf course, Bayer CropScience, which markets imidacloprid, tries to downplay such findings. Ecotoxicologist David Fischer of Bayer CropScience pointed out that earlier research didn't find a decline in young queens, Science News reports. However, those earlier studies were done on constrained rather than free-flying bees, and Goulson reportedly replied to Fisher's objection by pointing out that \"navigation isn't important when you live in a box.\"\n\nBlamed for Bee Collapse, Monsanto Buys Leading Bee Research Firm\n\nGenetic engineering of crops has also been blamed for dwindling bee populations. Monsanto, which is the leader in this type of biotechnology is likely none too pleased about the accusations, which, if found to be truthful through the dedicated application of research into the mystery, stands to lose just about everything\u2014both their genetically engineered crop seeds and the pesticides\/herbicides to go with them. It appears Monsanto has taken a proactive stance to the problem and is getting more involved\u2014by purchasing one of the leading bee research firms... A recent Activist Post article reportsxxi : \"Recently\n\nIt can be found in public company reports hosted on mainstream media that Monsanto scooped up the Beeologics firm back in September, 2011. During this time the correlation between Monsanto's GM crops and the bee decline was not explored in the mainstream, and in fact it was hardly touched upon until Polish officials addressed the serious concern amid the monumental ban.\n\nOwning a major organization that focuses heavily on the bee collapse and is recognized by the USDA for their mission statement of \"restoring bee health and protecting the future of insect pollination\" could be very advantageous for Monsanto. In fact, Beelogics' company information states that the primary goal of the firm is to study the very collapse disorder that is thought to be a result \u2014 at least in part \u2014 of Monsanto's own creations.\"\n\nIt'll be interesting to see the results emerging from Beeologics in the future, with regards to Monsanto products and their impact on bee populations, now that Monsanto owns it lock stock and barrel...\n\nHoney: Nectar of the Gods\n\nHoney gathering has been a human tradition since Paleolithic times. Honey bees came to North America during the 17th Century alongside migrating humans, and have been an integral part of American culture ever since. Pure, natural, unfiltered raw honey has an abundance of medicinal and nutritional uses, including the following: A bounty of nutrition, including enzymes, antioxidants, amino acids, vitamins and minerals Promotes the growth of friendly bacteria in your intestinal tract Good for your skin Helps with occasional sleeplessness Promotes heart health by reducing homocysteine levels Tames allergies Can help fight viruses, such as herpes, and bacteria, such as that present in chronic sinusitis Helps sooth a cough Helps prevent tooth decay\n\nHoney's healing powersx come from components such as:\n\n* Glucose oxidase: This is an enzyme that breaks down glucose and generates hydrogen peroxide, which has antimicrobial properties * Methylglyoxal or MGO: This powerful antibacterial compound is only found in certain natural honeys (highest in Manuka honey, which is made by bees that feed off the flowers of the Manuka bush, a medicinal plant native to New Zealand) * Bee Defensin 1:An antimicrobial peptide (AMP); this special protein is found in royal jelly (the food made especially for queen bee larvae)\n\nOther identified AMPs in honey, such as apidaecin, may be able to prevent bacteria from defending themselves and seem to help modulate your immune system. However, in order to reap these health benefits, you must be eating the right kind of honey. Look for raw, unfiltered organic honey, and be extremely careful about what passes for \"honey\" on big box store shelves.\n\nPrecautionary Note...\n\nAlthough raw honey is loaded with all of the benefits described above, you still must exercise caution in how much you consume because it's about 70 percent fructose. Fructose is fructose, and if you're challenged with insulin resistance, you will not likely do well eating large quantities of honey. Please also note that honey should not be given to children under one year of age. Infants less than 12 months old are at risk for infant botulism from eating honey that contains Clostridium botulinum spores, and in a baby, this can result in nervous system damage or even death. These spores do not affect older children and adults.\n\nAre You Eating Funny Honey?\n\nFake honey is unfortunately common in this era of food manipulation and control. Some Chinese brokers sell a mixture of sugar water, malt sweeteners, corn or rice syrup, jaggery, barley malt sweetener or other additives, and label it as \"honey\". Nearly all of this fake honey is made in China.\n\nA good deal of this \"funny honey\" is also tainted with illegal antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, which can cause DNA damage and cancer, and heavy metals such as lead.\n\nA recent report by Food Safety Newsxi reveals just how often they get away with this trickery. More than 75 percent of the honey on American supermarket shelves may be ultra-processed\u2014to the point that all inherent medicinal properties are completely gone\u2014and then smuggled into the country by the barrel drum. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) states that any product that's been ultra-filtered and no longer contains pollen is NOT honey. In their investigation, Food Safety News discovered the following:\n\nThe good news is, all of the samples from farmers markets, co-ops, and natural stores like Trader Joe's had the full, proper compliment of pollen, as did organic brands from common grocery stores. But fake honey\u2014the sorry substitute that it is\u2014might be the ONLY thing even remotely resembling honey that you'll be able to get if we don't find a way to save our honey bees from total global collapse.\n\nThe Buzz about Organic Beekeeping\n\nOne way to make sure your honey is high quality and contains the full compliment of natural health benefits is to obtain it from organic beekeepers, preferably local ones. Supporting organic beekeepers will also increase healthy bee colonies, which are so crucial to our food supply.\n\nOrganic beekeepers take a far different approach to beekeeping than large migratory operations. They don't feed their bees the sugar syrups and artificial pollen substitutes typically used in commercial bee operations, and they avoid chemical pesticides. They have fewer hives, and they don't truck their bees around for pollination.\n\nSeveral countries have banned many systemic insecticides, including France, Italy, Germany, and Slovenia. Most European nations place safety as the highest priority. When there is evidence of an environmental problem, they take the chemical off the market. Not so in America, where government regulators are in the grips of the agrichemical industry, and \"pestitution\" remains legal.\n\nBut there is some good news. One of America's most effective environmental action groups, the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC)xii , has come to the aid of our honey bees. NRDC sued EPA in federal court about improper approval of a certain systemic pesticide\u2014and won. They stopped the retail sale of Bayer's toxic Moventoxiii as of January 2010. As these damaging chemicals are eliminated, there is hope for honey bee recovery. In France, honey bee populations bounced back just one year after these products were banned from the marketplace.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nVanishing of the Bees recommends four actions you can take to help preserve our honey bees:\n\n* Support organic farmers and shop at local farmer's markets as often as possible. You can \"vote with your fork\" three times a day. * Cut the use of toxic chemicals in your house and on your lawn, and use organic pest control. * Better yet, get rid of your lawn altogether and plant a garden. Lawns offer very little benefit for the environment. Both flower and vegetable gardens provide good honey bee habitats. * Become an amateur beekeeper. Having a hive in your garden requires only about an hour of your time per week, benefits your local ecosystem, and you can enjoy your own honey!\n\nIf you are interested in more information about bee preservation, the following organizations are a good place to start.\n\nHoney bee sanctuaries are springing up everywhere, as the award-winning documentary \"Queen of the Sun\"xviii portrays. Many city dwellers are now becoming backyard beekeepers. Perhaps CCD is a blessing in disguise in that it's brought bees to the forefront of our awareness and sparked a renewed interest in organic beekeeping. Increased numbers of amateur beekeepers are bringing these fuzzy pollinators into their own neighborhoods. More cities are changing ordinances that formerly prevented beekeeping inside city limits\u2014including New York City.\n\nFor more information about raising bees, consult The Practical Beekeeperxix and the Yahoo group \"Organic Beekeepers.\"xx\n\nI'm pleased to announce that the Money Bomb Against Monsanto has been officially launched!\n\nYes, it is official.\n\nVolunteers and staff from the California Right to Know Campaign are submitting nearly 1 million signed petitions from registered voters across the state of California to county officials, to place Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Act on the Ballot for November 6.\n\nStarting May 1, and extending through May 26, a broad coalition of farmers, health groups, and organic food manufacturers, will attempt to raise one million dollars (i.e. \"The Money Bomb\"). Donations can be made online, via regular snail mail, and over the phone. All donations will support state GMO-labeling campaigns and their defense from biotech bully lawsuits.\n\nThe Right to Know Gentically Engineered Food Act\n\nThis Act will require food manufacturers to identify genetically engineered ingredients on the labels of foods sold in California.\n\nWhen California voters pass this ballot initiative, the Label Genetically Engineered Food Act will also not allow the common practice of mislabeling genetically engineered foods as \"natural\" or \"all natural.\" It's imperative to understand why this initiative is so important and how it can affect all Americans, regardless of where you live.\n\nCalifornia has the eighth largest economy in the world, so passing a labeling law for genetically engineered foods in California can have the same impact as passing a federal law.\n\nLarge food companies are unlikely to accept having dual labeling; one for California and another for the rest of the country. It would be an expensive logistical nightmare, not to mention a massive PR problem.\n\nTo avoid the dual labeling, many would likely opt to not include using any genetically engineered, or risk going out of business.\n\nThis is what happened in Europe and over 40 countries around the world. It can happen in the U.S. This is why we can't leave California to battle the biotech giants on their own. They need your help! Donating funds to this campaign may be the best money you'll spend all year to safeguard your health, and the health of your children Making a generous donation to this campaign is the best chance every American has at this point to make that happen!\n\nThe Proverbial David versus Goliath\n\nNaturally, the biotech industry is not about to let this pass without a fight. Monsanto, the Farm Bureau, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, along with corporate agribusiness, are all raising millions of dollars to spread their propaganda in an effort to defeat the California Ballot Initiative, just like they did a decade ago in Oregon. At that time, a cabal of corporate giants, including Monsanto and DuPont, calling themselves The Coalition Against the Costly Labeling Law, outspent the pro-labeling group 30-1, and successfully defeated the labeling initiative by scaring voters into believing that labeling genetically engineered foods was unnecessary and would raise food prices.\n\nThey did it again in Washington state last month, where campaign contributions to three of the eight politicians on the Senate Agriculture Committee\u2014Democrat Brian Hatfield, and Republicans Jim Honeyford and Mark Schoesler\u2014guaranteed the bill's demise in committee. Right now, the biotech industry is also working to defeat similar GE labeling bills in Vermont, Hawaii, Connecticut, and other states. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, Monsanto spent $8 million on their lobbying efforts in 2010 alone, and gave more than $400,000 in political contributions. Monsanto also spent $120 million on advertising, to convince consumers that genetically engineered foods are safe \u2013 despite the overwhelming scientific evidence showing otherwise.\n\nLet's send them a message, loud and clear: We have the right to know what they put into our food!\n\nYou can do so by making a donation right now. The money will be used to counter the industry propaganda so that we can win this ballot.\n\nWe're Dropping the Money Bomb!\n\nAbout twenty employee that ended up in a position of power within the US federal government and its regulatory agencies, and this is precisely why previous efforts to get genetically engineered foods labeled have been blocked.\n\nNot so this time!\n\nBallot Initiatives like the one in California is one way for citizens to take back control from compromised politicians and government officials and bypass them entirely. To sweeten the deal further, a group of \"Right to Know\" public interest organizations and organic companies have pledged to match the first million dollars raised in this nationwide \"Drop the Money Bomb on Monsanto Campaign.\"\n\nSo click here, and help us raise 1 million dollars to win this historic campaign! These \"Right to Know\" groups include:\n\nYes, I believe we can! But we need to get the word out, which requires a strong campaign to educate the citizens of California to vote for the initiative on November 6. According to Ronnie Cummins of the Organic Consumers Association, we stand a good chance of winning in California because:\n\n* This time, we have far more scientific information and greater public awareness on our side. GE contamination is now a mainstream media issue. Monsanto has become the most hated corporation in the world. * This time, we have overwhelming public support. Polls show that more than 8 out of 10 voters in California want mandatory GE labeling. * This time, we have built the strongest coalition of concerned food consumers in history, for the exclusive purpose of passing this law.\n\nThe Time for Action is NOW!\n\nToday, I ask you to invest in this Initiative. Invest in your future. And invest as generously as you can. If you've already sent in your donation, thank you! If not, please contribute to this historic and critical campaign today. And then please forward this email to your friends. Share it on Facebook and Twitter. Print it out, hand it to all your friends. Every action counts!\n\nAs stated by Ronnie Cummins with the Organic Consumers Association:\n\n\" - and threatening to sue states like Vermont if they dare to pass a GMO labeling law.\n\n... Despite Monsanto's claims to the contrary, scientists are clear: genetically engineered food has been linked to a wide range of health hazards, including kidney and liver damage, infertility, auto-immune disorders, allergies and autism, accelerated aging, and birth defects...\n\nWe have the right to know if the food we buy has been genetically engineered.... making small donations can help the coalition behind this initiative run a dynamic, effective campaign to bring down Monsanto and the rest of the Biotech Bullies.\n\nSo please, join us, and make a donation right now! You can donate online, by phone, or by dropping a check in the mail. \"\n\n\"...my eyes beheld the 'BOOK OF MORMON'\u2014that book of books \u2026 which was the principal means, in the hands of God, of directing the entire course of my future life.\" - Parley Pratt\n\nIf you're already off to a good start on a healthy fitness plan, and you're looking for ways to take it to the next level, then you might want to consider a form of fasting called Scheduled Eating, or intermittent fasting.\n\nIn essence this fitness-enhancing strategy looks at the timing of meals, as well as when NOT to eat. This isn't one of those fad plans, where you eat just one or two things for several days in a row.\n\nIn fact, the longest time you'll ever abstain from food is 36 hours, although 14-18 hours is more common. You can also opt to simply delay eating. For example, skipping breakfast may be just the thing to kick-start you off a plateau in your fitness routine.\n\nBut hypoglycemics and diabetics beware\u2014there is a proper way to implement fasting, and hypoglycemic and\/or diabetics need to be particularly careful in order to not worsen their health.Ditto for pregnant or breastfeeding women.\n\nThe plan is supported by a growing body of evidence showing that certain forms of fasting are good for you, and Mark Sisson's excellent series on this topic on his blog on marksdailyapple.com, delve into this topic at some depth.\n\nFor me, the issue of fasting is a major shift from my typical recommendations.\n\nI've not been a major advocate for it in the past, but as many of you who have been reading this site for years know, I am always learning. Life is a journey, and no one has all the answers.\n\nI seek to explore the best concepts out there to maximize learning.\n\nTo that end, I've been playing around with various forms of fasting for about a year and a half, and I now feel I'm ready to make some suggestions based on my experience.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that fasting is not something you should undertake willy-nilly. You need to pay careful attention to your body, your energy levels, and how it makes you feel in general\u2014especially if you're diabetic, hypoglycemic, or pregnant. I'll share some precautionary notes in a moment.\n\nFurthermore, remember that the type of diet and\/or form of fasting that might be best for you will vary depending on your weight, health, and fitness goals. Is your goal to live a longer, healthier life? Or are you a competitive or elite athlete? It may surprise many to learn that you cannot achieve maximum fitness and maximum longevity and fertility at the same time.\n\nEach goal requires a different strategy, and will not provide you with equal end results. For example, elite female athletes typically have a difficult time getting pregnant\u2014their fitness has been maximized at the expense of their fertility, as female hormones depend on sufficient amounts of body fat.\n\nWhile most people need to address the foods they DO eat, before considering skipping meals, fasting can provide you with many benefits, and is another tool you can experiment with to help you reach your goals. However, please keep in mind that proper nutrition becomes even MORE important when fasting, so addressing your diet really should be your first step. Common sense will tell you that fasting combined with a denatured, highly processed, toxin-rich diet is likely to do more harm than good, as you're not giving your body proper fuel to thrive when you DO eat.\n\nIntermittent Fasting for Weight Loss\n\nIn part 1, Mark Sisson discusses the merits of using fasting\u2014in whatever form\u2014to achieve weight loss. Overall, the research is very favorable for this goal. He lists three studies from recent years into fasting for weight loss, all of which showed positive results:\n\n1. Non-obese patients lost an average of four percent of their total fat with alternate-day fasting for 22 days. Their fasting insulin also decreased.i 2. Alternate-day fasting was also effective for obese patients in a 2009 study. On fasting days, participants consumed 25 percent of their daily calorie needs. On average, they lost just over 5.5 pounds in eight weeks, and about three percent of their total body fat. Total cholesterol and LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol decreased, while HDL (\"good\") cholesterol remained unchanged. Systolic blood pressure also decreased.ii 3. In young, overweight women, alternate-day fasting was just as effective as calorie restriction for promoting weight loss and improving metabolic markers.iii\n\nOne of the mechanisms that makes fasting so effective for weight loss is the fact that it provokes the secretion of human growth hormone (HGH), which is a fat-burning hormone. It also plays an important role in muscle building. Fasting also increases catecholamines, which increases resting energy expenditure, while decreasing insulin levels, which allows stored fat to be burned for fuel. Together, these and other factors will turn you into an effective fat-burning machine.\n\nHence, if like many tens of millions of people, your goal is to shed excess fat, fasting can be both effective and beneficial for improving many disease markers. The type of fast you choose appears to be less important, so pick whichever one fits your lifestyle, schedule, and temperament the best.\n\nI'll summarize the four different types of intermittent fasting programs that are covered very well in Mark Sisson's excellent series on this subject (see Sources below for links to his blog). Mark is particularly well qualified to report on this topic as he's a leading blogger in the Paleo community, and a former elite Olympic Trials athlete.\n\nIntermittent Fasting for Athletes\n\nOne 2008 study that evaluated the effect of fasting during the Muslim observance of Ramadan found it had a positive effect on body mass and other health markers in trained athletesiv.\n\nWhile athletes are certainly concerned with shedding excess fat, another overriding concern is the optimization of muscle growth. For this, you need protein. As a general guideline, you'll want to consume a high quality protein 30-60 minutes after finishing your workout\u2014whey being one of the most ideal for this purpose, as it helps your body build muscle and lose fat simultaneously. Research has also shown that high quality protein from meat and whey has a positive effect on blood sugar, muscle building, changing body composition, and sparing muscle while losing fat.\n\nMany find it works out well to break their fast after working out, which would allow you to get the best of both worlds: the benefits of working out in a fasted state, and protein-loading about half-an-hour to an hour afterward. This is my new strategy. I will typically delay my breakfast until 11 or 12 and workout around 9 AM. Since my last meal is typically around 7 PM, I will fast for about 14-17 hours before I eat my first meal. The fact that you are sleeping during most of this time makes it relatively painless and easy to do.\n\nAvoid grain carbs, however. Although popular with many, \"carb loading\" is a mistake, particularly for people engaged in intense strength training, as you will burn carb fuel very quickly and then \"hit the wall.\" The same goes for most people who start their day with muffins, bagels, or pancakes for example. This type of breakfast typically ignites a vicious cycle of hunger and snacking on even more carbs. And the more you continue eating these carb snacks, the more insulin resistant you become.\n\nPart of what makes working out in a fasted state so effective is that your body actually has a preservation mechanism that protects your active muscle from wasting itself. So if you don't have sufficient fuel in your system when you exercise, you're going to break down other tissues but not the active muscle, i.e. the muscle being exercised. According to Ori Hofmekler, author of The Warrior Diet, you can quite literally re-design your physique using a combination of under-eating and exercise. However this really only works well once your metabolism has become proficient at burning fat. Mark discusses this in his series.\n\nWhat about competitive sports athletes who may be exerting themselves in competitions several times a week\u2014should they fast, and if so, when? Mark Sisson offers the following advicev:\n\n\"Personally, I would eat on game days. It might be fun to try out a few fasted games, just to see how you perform, but the likely optimal way to integrate fasting into competition is to save the fasting days for your training days. By doing this, you'll be \"training low, playing high,\" which should result in some beneficial adaptations after training and improved performance in the game (when you're \"high\" or fully replete with nutrients and calories).\"\n\nIf you're an athlete, keep in mind that fasting can be contraindicated with overtraining, so be cautious if you're more or less in constant training.\n\nIntermittent Fasting for General Health and Longevity\n\nFasting is historically common-place as it has been a part of spiritual practice for millennia. But modern science has confirmed there are many good reasons for fasting, including:\n\n* Normalizing your insulin sensitivity, which is key for optimal health as insulin resistance (which is what you get when your insulin sensitivity plummets) is a primary contributing factor to nearly all chronic disease, from diabetes to heart disease and even cancer * Normalizing ghrelin levels, also known as \"the hunger hormone\" * Promoting human growth hormone (HGH) production, which plays an important part in health, fitness and slowing the aging process * Lowering triglyceride levels * Reducing inflammation and lessening free radical damage\n\nThere's also plenty of research showing that fasting has a beneficial impact on longevity in animals. There are a number of mechanisms contributing to this effect. Normalizing insulin sensitivity is a major one, but fasting also inhibits the mTOR pathway, which plays an important part in driving the aging process. The fact that it improves a number of potent disease markers also contributes to fasting's overall beneficial effects on general health.\n\nInterestingly, one recent study that included more than 200 individuals, found that fasting increased the participants' low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol) by 14 percent and 6 percent, respectivelyvi. Why would fasting raise total cholesterol? Dr. Benjamin D. Horne, PhD, MPH, director of cardiovascular and genetic epidemiology at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, and the study's lead author, offers the following explanation:\n\n\"Fasting causes hunger or stress. In response, the body releases more cholesterol, allowing it to utilize fat as a source of fuel, instead of glucose. This decreases the number of fat cells in the body... This is important because the fewer fat cells a body has, the less likely it will experience insulin resistance, or diabetes.\"\n\nEven more remarkable, the study also found that fasting triggered a dramatic rise in HGH\u20141,300 percent in women, and an astounding 2,000 percent in men!\n\nHGH, commonly referred to as \"the fitness hormone\" plays an important role in maintaining health, fitness and longevity, including promotion of muscle growth, and boosting fat loss by revving up your metabolism. The fact that it helps build muscle while simultaneously promoting fat loss explains why HGH helps you lose weight without sacrificing muscle mass, and why even athletes can benefit from the practice (as long as they don't overtrain and are careful about their nutrition).\n\nThe only other thing that can compete in terms of dramatically boosting HGH levels is high-intensity interval training. If you're over the age of 30, especially if you lead an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, you've likely entered a phase known as somatopause (age-related growth hormone deficiency). As your HGH levels decrease, your levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) also decrease, and this is yet another important part of what drives your body's aging process.\n\nVariations of Fasting\n\nIn his blog on marksdailyapple.com, Mark Sisson delves into four different variations of fasting, and how to implement them. The variations he includes are:\n\n1. LeanGains (a fasting protocol by Martin Berkhanvii )\u2014A daily 14-16 hour fast, during which time you consume nothing, with the exception of non-caloric fluids. Sleeping time is included in this time-frame, leaving an 8-10 hour window during the day when you're allowed to eat.\n\nThis protocol is designed with regular exercise in mind, with specific nutrient ratios for workout days and rest days, and is geared for those who want to shed excess fat and gain muscle mass. Hence, it's best suited for those who are actually exercising and lifting weights each week and can tolerate working out in a fasted state. 2. Eat Stop Eat (created by Brad Pilonviii)\u2014In this protocol, you fast for a full 24 hours once or twice a week. Your fast should be broken with a regular-sized meal (i.e. avoid gorging when coming off your fast), and you can maintain a regular exercise program without any special diet recommendations for workout days.\n\nFasting for 24 hours can be tough for some people, but I would agree with Mark's advice that eating a high-fat, low-carb diet can make 24-hour fasting easier, as a higher fat diet will tend to normalize your hunger hormones and provide improved satiety for longer periods of time. 3. The Warrior Diet (by Ori Hofmekler)\u2014This is another protocol designed to improve your fitness by exercising in a fasted state. I've interviewed Ori and posted detailed articles on this in the past. His plan calls for 20 hours of fasting, and four hours of \"feasting.\" You exercise during the day in a fasted state. Raw vegetables are allowed during your fast, but no protein, which is reserved for \"feasting\" or post-exercise recovery meals.\n\nTo learn more about the Warrior Diet, please see this previous interview with Ori. 4. Alternate Day Fasting\u2014This fasting protocol is exactly as it sounds: one day off, one day on. When you include sleeping time, the fast can end up being as long as 32-36 hours.\n\nAs Mark notes, this may be the most difficult of all types of fasting, as it will require you to go to bed with an empty stomach a few times a week. It's definitely not for everyone.\n\nMark rounds off his list with one last suggestion: to simply let your hunger guide you and skip meals if you're not hungry. While this should work really well for those who are otherwise healthy and are not struggling with food cravings, it may not work if you're constantly craving food. Food cravings is a sign that you're not providing your body with proper nutrients in the appropriate ratios, so following your hunger in this case could be staggeringly counterproductive.\n\nWho Should Use Extra Caution when Fasting, or Avoid it Altogether?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, if you're hypoglycemic, diabetic, or pregnant (and\/or breastfeeding), you need to be extra cautious with fasting, and may be best served to avoid it entirely, until you've normalized your blood glucose and insulin levels, or weaned the baby.\n\nHypoglycemia is a condition characterized by an abnormally low level of blood sugar. It's commonly associated with diabetes, but you can be hypoglycemic even if you're not diabetic. Common symptoms of a hypoglycemic crash include:\n\n* Headache * Weakness * Tremors * Irritability * Hunger\n\nAs your blood glucose levels continue to plummet, more severe symptoms can set in, such as:\n\nOne of the keys to eliminating hypoglycemia is to eliminate sugars, especially fructose from your diet. It will also be helpful to eliminate grains, and replace them with higher amounts of quality proteins and healthful fats, However it will take some time for your blood sugar to normalize. You'll want to pay careful attention to hypoglycemic signs and symptoms, and if you suspect that you're crashing, make sure to eat something. Ideally, you should avoid fasting if you're hypoglycemic, and work on your overall diet to normalize your blood sugar levels first. Then try out one of the less rigid versions of fasting and work your way up to a full 24-hour fast.\n\nAs for pregnant and\/or lactating women, I don't think fasting would be a wise choice. Your baby needs plenty of nutrients, during and after birth, and there's no research supporting fasting during this important time. Sisson lists three studies on fasting during pregnancy, and all three suggested it might be contraindicated, as it can alter fetal breathing patterns, heartbeat, and increase gestational diabetes. It may even induce premature labor.\n\nMy recommendation would be to really focus on improving your nutrition during this crucial time. A diet with plenty of raw organic, biodynamic foods, and foods high in healthful fats, coupled with high quality proteins will give your baby a head start on good health. You'll also want to be sure to include plenty of cultured and fermented foods to optimize your\u2014and consequently your baby's\u2014gut flora. For more information, please see this previous article that includes specific dietary recommendations for a healthy pregnancy, as well as my interview with Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride.\n\nOthers categories of people that would be best served to avoid fasting include those living with chronic stress, and those with cortisol dysregulation.\n\nFasting\u2014Is it Right for You?\n\nI understand it can get confusing at times, trying to determine when and what to eat in order to optimize your health. Unfortunately, besides a few basic principles that will apply to virtually everyone, such as strictly limiting consumption of sugars (particularly fructose) and grains, the rest is really a matter of figuring out what works for your individual biochemistry. This requires some trial and error.\n\nFor example, there is good evidence supporting the recommendation to eat a protein-heavy breakfast if you want to lose weight, and even more so if you exercise first thing in the morning to optimize muscle growth and recovery. But there may be times when you feel like you've hit a plateau, and while your diet and exercise routine may be good, the simple act of skipping breakfast and exercising on an empty stomach could be just the thing that will kick start you onto that next level.\n\nPersonally, I skip breakfast and exercise in a fasting state whenever I've gained a few pounds and want to get them off. I find this works well for me. While I'm not eating breakfast, I don't really eliminate that meal entirely; rather I'm simply delaying it until noon or later, in order to reap the metabolic rewards of exercise combined with calorie restriction.\n\nWhile I have not widely promoted calorie restriction in the past (as I believe most people need to address the foods they DO eat, before considering skipping meals), it is an important piece of the puzzle, and intermittent fasting may be helpful for many, especially if you've already mastered a nutritious diet, which really should be your first step. Fasting combined with a highly processed, toxin-rich diet is not going to do your health any favors. In fact, you may be making things worse, since you're not giving your body proper fuel when you DO eat.\n\nAlso remember that fasting does not mean abstaining from ALL food for extended periods of time, but rather a dramatic reduction of calorie intake at regular intervals\u2014whether you opt for a 16, 20, or 24 hour fast once or twice a week, or fasting every other day, or simply delaying certain meals, such as skipping breakfast and exercising on an empty stomach. As always, listen to your body, and go slow; work your way up to full day fasts if your normal schedule has included multiple meals a day. Also be sure to address any hypoglycemic tendencies, as it can get increasingly dangerous the longer you go without eating to level out your blood sugar.\n\nBottom Line\n\nI will finish off with Mark Sisson's \"bottom line,\" practical, and sound recommendations, as he sums it up nicelyix:\n\n\"... [T]here is no concrete, objective law regarding the suitability of intermittent fasting for a particular person.\n\nIf you're truly hungry, eat. Failing to do so will add stress.\n\nIf you're stressed, don't IF (intermittent fast). You don't need another stressor.\n\nIn the end, the prudent path is to simply listen to your body. Don't let CW grazing propaganda drive you to eat when you aren't hungry; don't let the IF dogma make you feel guilty about grabbing a handful of macadamia nuts and jerky in between meals when you are fasting. Try it out, skip a meal, go fourteen hours or so (you already do eight every night) without eating, get a workout in, go for a walk, go about your day and see how you feel. A quick trial is not going to kill you...\n\nAre you lightheaded?\n\nAre you weak?\n\nDid your workout suffer?\n\nThen maybe it's not for you. Maybe you need to fix a few things (Primal eating, sleep, chronic stress) and then try again...\"\n\nNutritionists have long been interested in the dynamics of telomere length in the body, and how telomeres figure in to human health and life expectancy. Telomeres were first discovered in 1973 by Alexey Olovnikov.\n\nHe found that the tiny units of DNA at the very end of each chromosome\u2014the telomere\u2014shorten with time because they cannot replicate completely each time the cell divides and they may be the most powerful biological clock that has yet to be identified.\n\nHence, as you get older, your telomeres get shorter and shorter. Eventually, DNA replication and cell division ceases completely, at which point you die. However, a growing body of research is showing that certain nutrients play a huge role in protecting telomere length; greatly affecting how long you live.\n\nOne Way Nutrition Affects Longevity\n\nFor example, in one recent studyi, scientists found that the B vitamin folate plays an important part in maintenance of DNA integrity and DNA methylation, which in turn influences telomere length.\n\nResearchers also found that women who use vitamin B12 supplements have longer telomeres than those who don't. Vitamin D3, zinc, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins C and E also influence telomere length. This supports the findings of an earlier study from 2009, which provided the first epidemiologic evidence that the use of multivitamins by women is associated with longer telomeres.ii According to the authors:\n\n\"Compared with nonusers, the relative telomere length of leukocyte DNA was on average 5.1% longer among daily multivitamin users. In the analysis of micronutrients, higher intakes of vitamins C and E from foods were each associated with longer telomeres, even after adjustment for multivitamin use.\"\n\nThe mechanism by which nutrients appear to affect telomere length is by influencing the activity of telomerase, an enzyme that adds the telomeric repeats to the ends of your DNA. Thousands of studies have been published on telomerase, and they are well-known to maintain genomic stability, prevent the inappropriate activation of DNA damage pathways, and regulate cellular aging.\n\nIn 1984, Elizabeth Blackburn PhD, professor of biochemistry and biophysics at UCSF, discovered that the enzyme telomerase actually has the ability to lengthen the telomere by synthesizing DNA from an RNA primer. She, along with Carol Greider and Jack Szostak were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2009 \"for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.\"\n\nThe Science of Growing Younger\n\nI believe the science of telomeres offers the most exciting and viable possibility for extreme life extension\u2014the kind of anti-aging strategy that can actually allow you to regenerate and in effect \"grow younger.\" Naturally, researchers are hard at work devising pharmaceutical strategies to accomplish this, but there's solid evidence that simple lifestyle strategies and nutritional intervention can do this too. This is great news, as short telomeres are a risk factor not just for death itself, but for many diseases as well.\n\nFor example, telomere shortening has been linked to the diseases listed below. But animal studies have also shown that these types of health problems can be reversed by restoring telomerase functioning:\n\nThe featured study found the following nutrients to have a beneficial impact on telomere length: Vitamin B12 Zinc Vitamin D Omega-3 Vitamin C Vitamin E\n\nBelow, I will review a few of those, plus several additional recommendations for what I believe are among the most important nutrients to maintain and promote telomere lengthening.\n\nNaturally, any attempt at a list like this is bound to fail to some degree as we really need a balance of a wide variety of nutrients. However, I believe it's possible to make some general recommendations based on the fact that most people are sorely deficient in many of these key nutrients that we know are important for optimal health. Others, such as astaxanthin and curcumin, just have such robust scientific support that it would seem foolish to ignore them when the benefits are so profound. With that said, here are my recommendations for the top 12 anti-aging nutrients, followed by two bonus strategies that do not involve taking supplements that can also help radically increase your lifespan by protecting your telomeres.\n\nI have listed the 12 nutrients below in the order that I believe they have in importance. I personally take the first six every day but the vitamin D is through sun exposure, not through an oral supplement.\n\n1. Vitamin D\n\nIn one study of more than 2,000 women, those with higher vitamin D levels were found to have fewer aging-related changes in their DNA, as well as lowered inflammatory responsesiii. Women with higher levels of vitamin D are more likely to have longer telomeres, and vice versa. This means that people with higher levels of vitamin D may actually age more slowly than people with lower levels of vitamin D.\n\nThe good news is that vitamin D is a potent inhibitor of your body's inflammatory response, and by reducing inflammation, you diminish your turnover of leukocytes, effectively creating a positive chain reaction that can help protect you against a variety of diseases. In essence, it protects your body from the deterioration of aging. Researchers have found that subsets of leukocytes have receptors for the active form of vitamin D (D3), which allows the vitamin to have a direct effect on these cells. This may also explain the specific connection between vitamin D and autoimmune disease.\n\nThe absolute best way to optimize your vitamin D levels would be through safe sun exposure. I am fully aware that many will not be able to implement this recommendation due to lifestyle constraints, but I feel I would be reprehensibly negligent if I did not emphasize how superior photo vitamin D is compared to oral. So for those who are able to, I have provided the following video that helps you find the times exposing your skin to the sun will actually produce vitamin D in your location.\n\n2. Astaxanthin (derived from the microalgae Haematoccous pluvialis)\n\nIn the 2009 study on multivitamin use and telomere length, longer telomeres were also associated with the use of antioxidant formulasiv. According to the authors, telomeres are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. Additionally, inflammation induces oxidative stress and lowers the activity of telomerase (again, that's the enzyme responsible for maintaining your telomeres).\n\nAstaxanthin has emerged as one of the most potent and beneficial antioxidants currently known, with potent anti-inflammatory and DNA-protective capabilities. Research has even shown that it can protect against DNA damage induced by gamma radiationv. It has a number of unique features that make it stand out from the crowd.\n\nFor example, it is by far the most powerful carotenoid antioxidant when it comes to free radical scavenging: astaxanthin is 65 times more powerful than vitamin C, 54 times more powerful than beta-carotene, and 14 times more powerful than vitamin Evi. It's also far more effective than other carotenoids at \"singlet oxygen quenching,\" which is a particular type of oxidation. It is 550 times more powerful than vitamin E, and 11 times more powerful than beta-carotene at neutralizing singlet oxygen.\n\nAnother feature that separates astaxanthin from other carotenoids is that it cannot function as a pro-oxidant. Many antioxidants will act as pro-oxidants (meaning they start to cause rather than combat oxidation) when present in your tissues in sufficient concentrations. This is why you don't want to go overboard taking too many antioxidant supplements like beta-carotene, for example. Astaxanthin, on the other hand, does not function as a pro-oxidant, even when present in high amounts, which makes it highly beneficial.\n\nLastly, one of its most profound features is its unique ability to protect the entire cell from damage\u2014both the water-soluble part and the fat-soluble portion of the cell. Other antioxidants affect just one or the other. This is due to astaxanthin's unique physical characteristics that allow it to reside within the cell membrane will also protecting the inside of the cell. To learn more about astaxanthin, please listen to the following interview with Dr. Robert Corish.\n\n3. Ubiquinol (CoQ10)\n\nCoenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is the fifth most popular supplement in the United States, taken by about 53 percent of Americans, according to a 2010 survey by ConsumerLab.comvii. This is a good thing as one in every four Americans over 45 is taking a statin and every single one of these individuals needs to be taking it.\n\nCoQ10 is used by every cell in your body. In fact, it is so important for your body's daily functions that it is also known as \"ubiquinone\" because it's 'ubiquitous' in the human body.\n\nWhat you may not know, however, is that to benefit from the form of the nutrient needed to produce cellular energy and help you reduce the typical signs of aging, your body must convert the ubiquinone to the reduced form, called ubiquinol -- and research is showing that this reduced form may actually be superior for your health in a number of ways. If you're under 25 years old your body is capable of converting CoQ10 from the oxidized to the reduced form. However, if you're older, your body becomes more and more challenged to convert the oxidized CoQ10 to ubiquinol.\n\nPremature aging is one primary side effect of having too little CoQ10 because this essential vitamin recycles other antioxidants, such as vitamin C and E. CoQ10 deficiency also accelerates DNA damage, and because CoQ10 is beneficial to heart health and muscle function this depletion leads to fatigue, muscle weakness, soreness and eventually heart failure.\n\nIn a previous interview with Dr. Stephen Sinatra, he recounts an experiment from the mid-90's on aging rats. The average lifespan of a rat is two years. Rats given CoQ10, at the end of their life, had more energy, better coats, and better appetites, compared to the rats that did not get CoQ10. The supplement basically had a potent anti-aging effect, in the sense it maintained youthfulness until the very end of their life. In terms of life extension, the effect was minimal.\n\nDr. Sinatra also conducted his own research and found that CoQ10 given to both younger and older mice resulted in increased energy and vigor. Older mice traveled through mazes quicker, they had better memory, and had more locomotor activity than those who did not get CoQ10. So CoQ10 definitely appears to improve the quality of life, even if it may not significantly increase longevity per say. For more information and dosage recommendations, please see this previous CoQ10 article.\n\n4. Fermented Foods \/ Probiotics\n\nIt's quite clear that eating a diet consisting of high amounts of processed foods will shorten your life, yet 90 percent of the money Americans spend on food is spent on processed food, and the number one source of calories in the US comes from high fructose corn syrup \u2013 a staple ingredient in nearly all processed foods, from frozen dinners, to condiments, snacks, and soda. Researchers have even discovered that genetic mutations and malfunctions that cause disease are created in future generations when highly processed and artificial foods are consumed!\n\nPart of the problem is that these processed, sugar- and chemical-laden foods effectively destroy your intestinal microflora. Your gut flora has incredible power over your immune system, which, of course, is your body's natural defense system. Antibiotics, stress, artificial sweeteners, chlorinated water and many other factors can also reduce the amount of probiotics (beneficial bacteria) in your gut, which can predispose you to illness and premature aging. Ideally, you'll want to make traditionally cultured and fermented foods a staple in your daily diet.\n\nYou can use a probiotic supplement, but getting your probiotics from food is definitely better as you can consume far more beneficial bacteria, in many cases up to 100X more. Fermented vegetables are an excellent alternative as they are both delicious and simple to make. In the following video, Caroline Barringer discusses the process of fermenting your own vegetables in some detail, so if you're up for fermenting some of your own foods, please listen to this interview.\n\nDownload Interview Transcript 5. Krill Oil\n\nAccording to Dr. Richard Harris, an expert on omega-3 fats, those who have an omega-3 index of less than four percent age much faster than those with indexes above eight percent. Therefore, your omega-3 index may also be an effective marker of your rate of aging. According to Dr. Harris' research, omega-3 fats appear to play a role in activating telomerase, which, again, has been shown to be able to actually reverse telomere shortening.\n\nAlthough this research is preliminary, I would suggest that optimizing your omega-3 levels above eight percent would be a good strategy if you're interested in delaying aging. (Your doctor can order the omega-3 index test from a lab called Health Diagnostic Laboratory in Richmond, Virginia.) After all, you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain by doing so, since omega-3 has proven to be extremely important for your health in so many respects.\n\nMy favorite animal-based omega-3 is krill oil, as it has a number of benefits not found in other omega-3 supplements such as fish oil. Aside from higher potential for contamination, fish oil supplements also have a higher risk of suffering oxidation damage and becoming rancid. Dr. Rudi Moerck has discussed these risks at great length in a previous interview. Krill oil also contains naturally-occurring astaxanthin, which makes it nearly 200 times more resistant to oxidative damage compared to fish oil.\n\nAdditionally, according to Dr. Harris' research, krill oil is also more potent gram for gram, as its absorption rate is much higher than fish oil. You get somewhere between 25 to 50 percent more omega-3 per milligram when you take krill oil compared to fish oil, hence you don't need to take as much.\n\n6. Vitamin K2\n\nVitamin K may very well be \"the next vitamin D\" as research continues to illuminate a growing number of benefits to your health. While most people get enough vitamin K from their diets to maintain adequate blood clotting, they're NOT enough to offer protection against more serious health problems. For example, research over the past few years suggest that vitamin K2 can provide substantial protection from prostate cancerviii, which is one of the leading causes of cancer among men in the United States. And research results are similarly encouraging for the benefits of vitamin K to your cardiac health:\n\nIn 2004, the Rotterdam Study, which was the first study demonstrating the beneficial effect of vitamin K2, showed that people who consume 45 mcg of K2 daily live seven years longer than people getting 12 mcg per dayix.\n\nIn a subsequent study called the Prospect Studyx, 16,000 people were followed for 10 years. Researchers found that each additional 10 mcg of K2 in the diet results in 9 percent fewer cardiac events.\n\nK2 is present in fermented foods, particularly cheese and the Japanese food natto, which is by far the richest source of K2.\n\n7. Magnesium\n\nAccording to the featured researchxi, magnesium also plays an important role in DNA replication, repair, and RNA synthesis, and dietary magnesium has been shown to positively correlate with increased telomere length in women. Other research has shown that long term deficiency leads to telomere shortening in rats and cell cultures. It appears the lack of magnesium ions has a negative influence on genome integrity. Insufficient amounts of magnesium also reduce your body's ability to repair damaged DNA, and can induce chromosomal abnormalities. According to the authors, it's reasonable to hypothesize that \"magnesium influences telomere length by affecting DNA integrity and repair, in addition to its potential role in oxidative stress and inflammation.\"\n\n8. Polyphenols\n\nPolyphenols are potent antioxidant compounds in plant foods, many of which have been linked to anti-aging benefits and disease reduction. Here are but a few examples of these potent antioxidant compounds:\n\n* Grapes (resveratrol) \u2014 Resveratrol deeply penetrates the center of your cell's nucleus, giving your DNA time to repair free radical damage. Research dating back to 2003 showed that resveratrol, a powerful polyphenol and anti-fungal chemical, was able to increase the lifespan of yeast cells.xii\n\nThe findings showed that resveratrol could activate a gene called sirtuin1, which is also activated during calorie restriction in various species. Since then studies in nematode worms, fruit flies, fish, mice, and human cells have linked resveratrol to longer lives.\n\nResveratrol is found in grapes, and there are numerous products on the market containing resveratrol. I recommend looking for one made from Muscadine grapes, and that uses WHOLE grape skins and seeds, as this is where many of the benefits are concentrated. * Cacao \u2014 Quite a few studies have confirmed the potent antioxidant properties, and subsequent health benefits, of raw cocoa powder. Dark, organic, unprocessed chocolate has been found to benefit your glucose metabolism (diabetic control), blood pressure, and cardiovascular health. * Green tea \u2014 Polyphenols in tea, which include EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) and many others, have been found to offer protection against many types of cancer. The polyphenols in green tea may constitute up to 30 percent of the dry leaf weight, so, when you drink a cup of green tea, you're drinking a fairly potent solution of healthy tea polyphenols.\n\nGreen tea is the least processed kind of tea, so it also contains the highest amounts of EGCG of all tea varieties. Keep in mind, however, that many green teas have been oxidized, and this process may take away many of its valuable properties. The easiest sign to look for when evaluating a green tea's quality is its color: if your green tea is brown rather than green, it's likely been oxidized.\n\nMy personal favorite is matcha green tea because it contains the entire ground tea leaf, and can contain over 100 times the EGCG provided from regular brewed green tea.\n\n9. Folate (aka Vitamin B9, or Folic Acid)\n\nAccording to the featured study in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, plasma concentrations of the B vitamin folate correspond to telomere length in both men and women. Folate plays an important role in the maintenance of DNA integrity and DNA methylation, both of which influence the length of your telomeresxiii.\n\nIt is useful for preventing depression, seizure disorders and brain atrophy. In fact, folate deficiency can lead to elevated homocysteine levels, which can be a major contributor to heart disease and Alzheimer's disease. One unfortunate and preventable reason why some believe folate numbers are slipping is the increased prevalence of obesity, which negatively affects the way most peoplemetabolize this important vitamin. The ideal way to raise your folate levels is to eat plenty of fresh, raw, organic leafy green vegetables, and beans.\n\nPlease note that it is the natural folate from food that has been found to be beneficial. This may not be true for the supplement folic acid.\n\n10. Vitamin B12\n\nVitamin B12 is fittingly known as \"the energy vitamin,\" and your body requires it for a number of vital functions. Among them: energy production, blood formation, DNA synthesis, and myelin formation. (Myelin is insulation that protects your nerve endings and allows them to communicate with one another.) Unfortunately, research suggests about 25 percent of American adults are deficient in this vitally important nutrient, and nearly half the population has suboptimal blood levels.\n\nVitamin B12 is found almost exclusively in animal tissues, including foods like beef and beef liver, lamb, snapper, venison, salmon, shrimp, scallops, poultry and eggs. It's not readily available in plants, so if you do not eat meat or animal products you are at risk of deficiency. The few plant foods that are sources of B12 are actually B12 analogs. An analog is a substance that blocks the uptake of true B12, so your body's need for the nutrient actually increases.\n\nIf you aren't getting sufficient B12 in your diet, I recommend you begin supplementation immediately with this vital nutrient with either an under-the-tongue fine mist spray or vitamin B12 injections. Ensuring your body has adequate B12 can vastly improve the quality of your life and prevent debilitating, even life-threatening diseases which result from a deficiency of this all-important nutrient.\n\n11. Curcumin (Turmeric)\n\nCurcumin \u2014 the active ingredient in the spice turmeric\u2014acts both as an immune booster and potent anti-inflammatory. But perhaps its greatest value lies in its anti-cancer potential, and it has the most evidence based literature backing up its anti-cancer claims of any other nutrient. It affects over 100 different pathways once it gets into a cell\u2014among them, percent curcuminoids that contains only 100 percent certified organic ingredients This previous article can provide you further details on how to use curcumin.\n\n12. Vitamin A\n\nAccording to the featured study in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, telomere length is positively associated with dietary intake of vitamin A in women who do not take multivitaminsxiv. It plays an important role in your immune response, and if you're deficient, you become predisposed to infections that can promote telomere shortening. However, vitamin A does not appear to have a dose-dependent effect on telomere length, so you don't need high amounts.\n\nTwo Additional Lifestyle Strategies that Affect Telomere Length\n\nWhile a nutritious diet accounts for about 80 percent of the benefits derived from a healthy lifestyle, exercise cannot be ignored, and there's evidence suggesting that exercise protects against telomere shortening as well. Yet another lifestyle strategy that can have a beneficial impact is intermittent fasting.\n\n* Exercise \u2014 One recent study on post-menopausal women suffering from chronic stress found that \"vigorous physical activity appears to protect those experiencing high stress by buffering its relationship with telomere length (TL).\" xv In fact, among the women who did not exercise, each unit increase in the Perceived Stress Scale was related to a 15-fold increase in the odds of having short telomeres. Those who did exercise regularly showed no correlation between telomere length and perceived stress!\n\nHigh-intensity exercise appears to be the most effective all-natural approach to slow down the aging process by reducing telomere shortening. In fact, research has shown there's a direct association between reduced telomere shortening in your later years and high-intensity-type exercisesxvi: Greta Blackburn's book The Immortality Edge: Realize the Secrets of Your Telomeres for a Longer, Healthier Lifexvii further details the importance of high-intensity exercise to prevent telomere shortening. * Intermittent Fasting \u2014 Previous research has shown that you can extend your lifespan by reducing your caloric intake, and I've written about this technique in the past. The problem is that most people do not understand how to properly cut calories, because in order to remain healthy, you have to cut out the right kind of calories\u2014namely carbohydrates. Research by Professor Cynthia Kenyon has shown that avoiding carbs will activate genes that govern youthfulness and longevity.\n\nBut the health benefits of calorie restriction can also be achieved by intermittent fasting (keep in mind you still need to cut out sugars and grains). For more detailed recommendations and guidance on intermittent fasting, or scheduled eating, please see this recent article that greatly expands on this complex topic, and highlights the precautions, as it certainly isn't for everyone.\n\nNearly one-quarter of Americans\n\nOf course, chronic stress \u2013 the kind that eats away at you over time, such as relationship troubles or fear of losing your job \u2013 is linked to serious emotional and physical impairments, including the development of chronic diseases like heart disease, depression, high blood pressure and obesity.\n\nUnfortunately, while 94 percent of adults believe that stress can contribute to the development of major illnesses, only 29 percent say they are doing an excellent or very good job at preventing themselves from succumbing to it.ii\n\nIn the slideshow above you can read about 10 simple steps to help you de-stress, from the Harvard Health Beat. Below I've added several others to add to your arsenal as well.\n\nWhat's Causing All of This Stress?\n\nYou can probably rattle off a list of your own stressors without much trouble \u2013 and chances are they're not too much different from those revealed by the APA's latest survey. While money, work and the economy continue to be the most common sources for stress among Americans (for five years and counting), personal and family health concerns are increasingly being listed, which makes having effective stress reduction techniques that much more important.\n\nThe fact is, you can't separate your physical health from the emotions caused by life circumstances such as these. Every feeling you have affects some part of your body. And stress can wreak havoc even if you're doing everything else \"right.\"\n\nExtreme, sudden stress like the loss of a loved one or a job can have near-immediate impacts on your health, but so too can lingering everyday stressors that we all juggle, particularly when they're not dealt with over time. This causes your body to remain in \"fight or flight\" mode for far too long -- much longer than was ever intended from a biological standpoint.\n\nOne of the most common consequences of this scenario is that your adrenal glands, faced with excessive stress and burden, become overworked and fatigued. This can lead to a number of related health conditions, including fatigue, autoimmune disorders, skin problems and more. Stress has also been linked to cancer by acting as a pathway between cancerous mutations, potentially triggering the growth of tumors. In fact, stress, and by proxy your emotional health, is a leading factor in virtually any disease or illness you can think of.\n\nAre Your Stress-Relief Techniques Doing More Harm Than Good?\n\nKeeping your stress levels under control has to be an ongoing commitment, like preparing healthy meals and exercising. Unfortunately, many fall into a vicious trap where their strategies for dealing with stress center on unhealthy activities, like watching TV, drinking alcohol, or eating junk foods.\n\nThe APA reports:iii\n\n\"Year after year, the Stress in America survey paints a picture of a nation at a critical crossroads when it comes to stress and health. Overall, Americans appear to be caught in a vicious cycle where they manage stress in unhealthy ways, and seemingly insurmountable barriers prevent them from making the lifestyle or behavioral changes necessary for good health.\n\nFindings from the 2011 survey found that several groups of people in particular \u2014 caregivers and those living with chronic illness \u2014 are at heightened risk of experiencing serious consequences of stress that is too high and appears to be taking a toll on their emotional and physical health.\"\n\nThe more you rely on unhealthy coping mechanisms, the worse your symptoms of stress are likely to become, as methods like drinking or binge eating are only distractions designed to make you temporarily forget your stress. As soon as the drink or candy bar is gone, your stress will return, and may even be intensified. This can prompt even more unhealthy behaviors; for instance, 44 percent of survey respondents reported lying awake at night due to stress, while 39 percent reported overeating or eating unhealthy foods. Not surprisingly, a large number of people are suffering deeply due to stress with the symptoms that follow.\n\nMore Healthy Strategies to Send Your Stress Packing \u2026\n\nIn addition to the 10 strategies in the above slideshow, I cannot stress enough (pun intended!) how important a healthy diet and exercise program are for your mental well-being. When you exercise, your body naturally increases the levels of endorphins, or \"feel good\" hormones, in your brain, while nourishing your body with healthy foods will give you the energy to fight back against stress (for instance, B vitamins are known to help ease feelings of anxiety and vitamin C may help lower stress hormone levels).\n\nIn addition, my favorite overall tool to manage stress is EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), which is like acupuncture without the needles. It's a handy, free tool for unloading emotional baggage quickly and painlessly, and so easy that even children can learn it. Other common stress-reduction tools with a high success rate include prayer, meditation, laughter and yoga, for example. Learning relaxation skills, such as deep breathing and positive visualization, which is the \"language\" of the subconscious.\n\nWhen you create a visual image of how you'd like to feel, your subconscious will understand and begin to help you by making the needed biochemical and neurological changes.\n\nStill others, as reported by the APA survey as being \"believed to be effective among those who use them\" are as follows. Choose whichever one (or a combination of them) that appeals to you, and if you don't sense any benefits, try another, until you find what works best for you.\n\n* When epileptic patients improved their vitamin D levels, their seizures were reduced by an average of 40% * One patient who had extremely low vitamin D levels, and averaged 450 seizures in three months, reduced the seizures to 30 after raising vitamin D levels * People with epilepsy face an even greater risk of vitamin D deficiency than the general population, as seizures may interfere with your ability to get outdoors and stay active, which can limit your exposure to the sunlight necessary for producing vitamin D; also, anti-epileptic drugs can interfere with vitamin D metabolism, further exacerbating the deficiency * The IDEAL way to optimize your vitamin D levels is through appropriate sun or safe tanning bed exposure, although a vitamin D3 supplement is better than no vitamin D at all __________________________\n\nBy Dr. Mercola\n\nNearly half of people with epilepsy are also vitamin D deficient,i, but despite this well-known association, only a single study has been published on the effect of vitamin D for seizure control in the last 40 years.\n\nThat study revealed that treating epileptic patients with vitamin D2 \u2013 the far inferior type of synthetic vitamin D \u2013 reduced the number of seizures, and in 1974 researchers concluded that \"the results may support the concept that epileptics should be treated prophylactically with vitamin D.\"ii\n\nNow, nearly four decades later researchers have again revealed that \"the normalization of serum vitamin 25(OH)D [vitamin D] level has an anticonvulsant [anti-seizure] effect.\"iii\n\nImproving Vitamin D Levels Reduces Seizures by 40%\n\nIn the latest study, researchers administered a one-time 40,000-200,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 to patients with epilepsy in order to bring their vitamin D levels out of a deficiency state.\n\nThe participants, who ranged in age from 10-42, had vitamin D levels ranging from 4 ng\/ml to 34 ng\/ml, with a median level of 11.8. This is an absolutely dangerously low level. As you can see in the chart below, anything below 50 ng\/ml is a deficiency state.\n\nvitamin d levels\n\nAfter the treatment dose of vitamin D, the participants' vitamin D levels did improve to a range of 23-45 ng\/ml, with a median of 38 ng\/ml. It's important to note that this is still low according to the latest science \u2026 but the improvement still resulted in a decrease in their number of seizures. If their levels were optimized further, it's likely the results would improve even more.\n\nAfter increasing their vitamin D levels, the results showed:\n\n* 10 of the 13 subjects had a decrease in number of seizures * Overall, there was a median seizure number reduction of 40% * A seizure reduction of greater than 50% was experienced in five patients\n\nThe most revealing result, however, occurred among the person whose vitamin D was a dangerously low 4 ng\/ml at the start of the study. This person had 450 seizures in a three-month period, but after raising vitamin D level to 43.1 ng\/ml, the seizures dropped to 30 in three months! The study did have some limitations, namely the small number of subjects and the lack of a placebo to compare to, but it still highlighted the importance of correcting vitamin D deficiency in epilepsy patients.\n\nEpilepsy Patients are at Increased Risk of Vitamin D Deficiency\n\nThe findings are even more important given that people with epilepsy face an even greater risk of vitamin D deficiency than the general population (and even the general population is vastly vitamin D deficient). The reasons are two-fold, with the first being that having frequent seizures may interfere with your ability to get outdoors and stay active.\n\nIf you spend most of your time inside, you'll miss out on regular sun exposure, which is key for the natural production of vitamin D. Even exposing your skin to sunlight through a windowpane will prevent the entry of the UVB rays, which are the specific wavelength that produces vitamin D in your skin. So, it is crucial that you get outside and experience direct skin contact with the sunlight instead of sunning in a sunroom, for instance.\n\nSecond, anti-epileptic drugs that are often given to epilepsy patients can interfere with vitamin D metabolism, leading to deficiency. If you take these drugs, it is especially crucial that you actively monitor your vitamin D levels to avoid this side effect.\n\nWhy might vitamin D have such a significant impact on epileptic seizures? Epilepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, particularly your brain. Vitamin D is not \"just\" a vitamin; it's actually a neuroregulatory steroidal hormone that influences nearly 3,000 different genes in your body. Vitamin D receptors can be found in your brain, spinal cord, and central nervous system, and may enhance the amount of important chemicals in your brain needed to protect brain cells, for starters.\n\nThe Study Used Supplements, But Sunshine is Better\n\nResearchers used a one-time large dose of vitamin D3 to boost the participants' vitamin D levels. If you're going to supplement, vitamin D3 is certainly far superior to the vitamin D2 researchers used back in the 1970s.\n\nToday, however, vitamin D2 is still the form typically prescribed by doctors, so be aware of this if you're taking this nutrient in prescription form. A meta-analysis of 50 clinical trials looking at mortality rates for \"doctor recommended\" synthetic vitamin D2 supplements versus natural vitamin D3 shows a 6 percent risk reduction among those who used D3, compared to a 2 percent increased risk among those who used D2.\n\nResearch also shows vitamin D3 is approximately 87 percent more potent in raising and maintaining vitamin D concentrations and produces 2- to 3-fold greater storage of vitamin D than does D2. D3 is also converted into its active form 500 percent faster. So by all means use vitamin D3 if you're going to supplement, not D2 \u2013 but even better, simply get out in the sun, or use a safe tanning bed.\n\nThe IDEAL way to optimize your vitamin D levels is through appropriate sun or safe tanning bed exposure. While your skin does create vitamin D3 in response to sunlight, which is theoretically the same as the D3 you get from an oral supplement, there's cause to believe that the vitamin D created from sun exposure may have additional health benefits. Plus, you cannot overdose when getting your vitamin D from sun exposure, as your body has the ability to self-regulate and only make what it needs. You do, however, need to be cautious and avoid burning.\n\nIf you cannot get your vitamin D requirements from sun exposure, I recommend using a safe tanning bed (one with electronic ballasts rather than magnetic ballasts, to avoid unnecessary exposure to EMF fields). Safe tanning beds also have less of the dangerous UVA than sunlight, while unsafe ones have more UVA than sunlight. If neither of these are feasible options, then you should take an oral vitamin D3 supplement. It will certainly be better than no vitamin D at all, but you will need to monitor your levels via blood testing to ensure you stay within the therapeutic range.\n\nYou can learn more about maximizing your vitamin D from safe sun exposure in the video below. If you have epilepsy, it's possible that doing so could help you decrease seizure drugs (a very good thing, since all seizure drugs can increase your risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and some of these drugs can make you lose your memory and your hair).\n\nDr. Mercola notes that certain drugs are prescribed to be taken FOR LIFE. In this way, Big Pharma makes Big Bucks -- and engenders a type of \"Medical Slavery\", for life.\n\nBy Dr. Mercola\u2014how about a measly $321 million in exchange for a guilty plea to a misdemeanor? When you consider that this involves the second-largest drug maker in the U.S.\u2014Merck\u2014According to an April 16, 2008 article on MedHeadlinesiii:\n\n\"In about 96 journal publications, Ross and his colleagues\u2014\u2014at least in the United States\u2014\u2014 symptoms\u2014sym\u20141.

For more information about this, please listen to my interview with Robert Whitaker, author of Mad in America, and Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America.\n\nLook, he is stating factual instances of the government working to stifle small farms, apparently in support of Big Ag, but not in support of the people. ______________________\n\nBy Dr. Mercola\n\nIn its latest move against small farmers who dare to operate outside the umbrella of CAFOs (confined animal feeding operations) and Monsanto-dominated crops, the U.S. government has seized $70,000 from a small dairy farmer in Maryland. The feds did this under the \"Bank Secrecy Act,\" which requires that paperwork be filled out for any cash deposit in excess of $10,000.\n\nThe farmers, Randy Sowers and his wife Karen, made deposits totaling more than $295,000 from May 2011 to February 2012, but each transaction was less than $10,000.\n\nNow they are being accused of \"structuring,\" a violation of federal currency reporting requirements, as the feds are accusing them of deliberately depositing money in increments of less than $10,000 in an attempt to evade Currency Transaction Reporting requirements.\n\nGovernment Seizes $70,000 On What Grounds?\n\nThe dairy farmer's \"crime\" stems from his weekly sales at local farmers' markets. The sales averaged about the same amount each week and, dutifully, the Sowers deposited them. They'd reportedly never even heard of the Bank Secrecy Act or \"structuring,\" but that was of no interest to the feds\u2014the consistency of the amount the Sowers deposited, always less than $10,000, raised red flags to the feds, who claimed that this was indicative of a crime.\n\nThe government promptly seized about $70,000 from the bank account, then issued a warrant for the seizures. As reported by Food Freedom News:i\n\n\"The Dept. of Justice has since sued to keep $63,000 of the Sowers' money, though they committed no crime other than maintaining their privacy. Without funds, they will be unable to make purchases for the spring planting. When a similar action was taken against Taylor's Produce Stand last year, the feds seized $90,000, dropped the charges, and kept $45,000 of Taylor's money.\n\nKnowing that most farms operate on a very thin margin, such abuse of power wipes out a family's income, and for a bonus, the feds enhance the monopoly power of Monsanto, Big Dairy and their supply chain.\u2026 Former Maryland assistant U.S. attorney Steven Levin told the paper [City Paper], \"The emphasis is on basically seizing money, whether it is legally or illegally earned. It can lead to financial ruin for business owners, and there's a potential for abuse here by the government.\"\"\n\nThe raid on the Sowers was conducted by an agency created in 2009 to go after money-laundering criminals. The agency started out with a bang by seizing $1.2 billion from a real money launderer, but it appears that what it's interested in now is making criminals out of small business persons, including small farmers.\n\nWhy Are Family Farms Under Attack?\n\nIf they're not seizing bank accounts, it seems the government will find other ways to attack small farmers. A family farm in rural Michigan\u2014and possibly others\u2014may be shut down by a new state law that designates certain breeds of hogs as a threat to neighboring hog breeders and croplands.\n\nBasically, the fight is over the definition of feral hogs vs. domestic hogs. The dictionary definition of \"feral\" refers to an animal running wild. But Michigan authorities have taken it a step further and extended the definition to include enclosed private hunting preserves and small farms that house what authorities call an \"invasive species\" of hogs.\n\nThere is no genetic test to determine whether the species on these farms are truly invasive, so authorities are basing their cases against these farmers solely on visual observations. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) uses this vague description to describe the prohibited hogs, and makes it clear that this does not apply to the domestic hogs raised on CAFOs:ii\n\nOther descriptions supplied by the MDNR include such a wide variety of characteristics that virtually any pig other than the familiar pink domestic breed raised on CAFOs could potentially be deemed \"feral\":\n\nInterestingly, the Big Pork industry has been planning this anti-feral pig campaign for years, and even bragged about it in a 2010 newsletter.iii It was the same newsletter where they declared a win against the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) in Ohio, where HSUS was seeking legislation to end the practice of sow gestation stalls (cages so small the sow can't turn around or move).\n\nWhat this means for residents of Michigan is that soon they will be unable to purchase sustainably and humanely grown meat from the Mangalitsa \"wooly\" hogs raised on Baker's Green Acres farm. This particular breed is being raised by only a handful of small farms across the country; whereas more than 2 million pigs are slaughtered each week in the United States, only about 50 of them are Mangalitsas (which have been called the \"it\" pig by the New York Times, as several high-end restaurants and specialty markets have featured the rich, naturally raised meativ).\n\nBut, of course, this issue is about much more than pasture-raised pork from a heritage breed ... it's about your ability, your right, to purchase and consume pure, unadulterated food \u2013 a right that continues to be threated for those living in the United States.\n\nFDA Also Threatens Your Right to Food Choice \u2026\n\nAnother glaring example of government going out of its way to prohibit your access to pure, unprocessed food is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) war against raw milk. When the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund (FTCLDF) filed a lawsuit against the FDA over their raw milk ban, stating that banning raw milk in interstate commerce is unconstitutional, the FDA rebutted with the following extremely concerning and outrageous statements:\n\n* \"There is no absolute right to consume or feed children any particular food.\" * \"There is no 'deeply rooted' historical tradition of unfettered access to foods of all kinds.\" * \" * FDA's brief goes on to state that \"even if such a right did exist, it would not render FDA's regulations unconstitutional because prohibiting the interstate sale and distribution of unpasteurized milk promotes bodily and physical health.\" * \"There is no fundamental right to freedom of contract.\"\n\nSince when did the FDA have authority to tell you what you can and cannot eat and feed your children? Apparently they believe they've had it all along. If you go by these assertions, it means the FDA has the authority to prohibit any food of their choosing and make it a crime for you to seek it out. If, one day, the FDA deems tomatoes, broccoli or cashews capable of causing you harm (which is just as ludicrous as their assertions that raw milk is harmful), they could therefore enact such a ban and legally enforce it.\n\nWhat this means is that freedom of food choice is a myth if you live in the United States, and this simply is not acceptable. No one, and certainly not any government agency, should be able to restrict your access to pure, unadulterated food, but the dairy industry and other industrial farmers that depend on CAFOs employ powerful lobbyists will stop at nothing to persuade government to remove the small farmers from the market entirely. The truth is, if enough people start demanding naturally, sustainably and humanely raised meat, dairy and produce, the giant farming monopolies that currently dominate the market would not be able to compete.\n\nTheir businesses depend on pesticides, CAFOs, genetically modified seeds, growth hormones and the like \u2026 so when they see all-natural creameries like the one operated by Randy Sowers and his wife Karen, or natural farms like Bakers Green Acres gaining loyal and growing customer bases, they get nervous \u2013 and they get the government involved in any way they can.\n\nPlease Support Your Local Small Farms\n\nThe healthiest food choices are nearly always those that come from responsible, high-quality, sustainable sources.\n\nThis is why I encourage you to support the small family farms in your area. This includes not only visiting the farm directly, if you have one nearby, but also taking part in farmer's markets and community-supported agriculture programs. Now that summer is almost here in the United States, fresh produce and other wonderful whole foods are available in abundance. Not only is the food so much tastier and healthier when you get it from sustainable, non-CAFO sources, but there is something about shopping for fresh foods in an open-air, social environment that just feels right. An artificially lit, dreary supermarket -- home to virtually every CAFO food made -- just can't compete.\n\nIf you want to experience some of these benefits first-hand, here are some great resources to obtain wholesome food that supports not only you but also the environment:\n\n1.

But I warn you \u2026 the injustices it contains may just make your blood boil.\n\nLooking for ways to boost your intellect, stave off mental aging, and maybe even live a longer life? You might be surprised to learn that not only do such strategies exist, but many are easily attainable by making simple tweaks here and there to your daily routine. Embracing the strategies that follow may give a hearty boost to your brainpower, help you keep mentally healthy and ultimately even make yourself smarter.\n\nNine Tips for a Smarter You \u2026\n\n1. Exercise\n\nExercise encourages your brain to work at optimum capacity by causing nerve cells to multiply, strengthening their interconnections and protecting them from damage. During exercise nerve cells release proteins known as neurotrophic factors. One in particular, called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), triggers numerous other chemicals that promote neural health, and directly benefits cognitive functions, including learning. Further, exercise provides protective effects to your brain through:\n\n* The production of nerve-protecting compounds * Greater blood flow to your brain * Improved development and survival of neurons * Decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke\n\nA 2010 study on primates published in Neurosciencei also revealed that regular exercise not only improved blood flow to the brain, but also helped the monkeys learn new tasks twice as quickly as non-exercising monkeys, a benefit the researchers believe would hold true for people as well.\n\nStill more research has shown that exercise boosts mitochondria, organelles that produce energy within every cell of your body, which suggests exercise may help your brain work faster and more efficiently.ii\n\nTo get the most out of your workouts, I recommend a comprehensive program that includes Peak Fitness high-intensity exercise, strength training, stretching, and core work.\n\n2. Animal-Based Omega-3 Fats\n\nDocosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, an omega-3 fat\n\nDHA is found in high levels in your neurons -- the cells of your central nervous system, where it provides structural support. When your omega-3 intake is inadequate, your nerve cells become stiff and more prone to inflammation as the missing omega-3 fats are substituted with cholesterol and omega-6 instead. Once your nerve cells become rigid and inflamed, proper neurotransmission from cell to cell and within cells become compromised.\n\nThe influence of omega-3 fat on physical and mental health has been the subject of intense research over the last four decades, and there's compelling evidence that animal-based omega-3 fats can help reduce the symptoms of a variety of psychiatric illnesses and degenerative brain disorders. For example, low DHA levels have been linked to memory loss and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nEven more exciting is research showing that degenerative conditions can not only be prevented but also potentially reversed. For example, in one study, 485 elderly volunteers suffering from memory deficits saw significant improvement after taking 900 mg of DHA per day for 24 weeks, compared with controls.iii\n\nAnother study found significant improvement in verbal fluency scores after taking 800 mg of DHA per day for four months compared with placebo.iv Furthermore, memory and rate of learning were significantly improved when DHA was combined with 12 mg of lutein per day.\n\nInterestingly, research suggests that the unsaturated fatty acid composition of normal brain tissue is age-specific, which could imply that the older you get, the greater your need for animal-based omega-3 fat to prevent mental decline and brain degeneration.\n\nTo compensate for our inherently low omega-3 diet, a high quality animal-based omega-3 supplement is something that I recommend for virtually everyone, especially if you're pregnant. I prefer krill oil compared to all other animal-based omega-3's, because while the metabolic effects of krill oil and fish oil are \"essentially similar,\" krill oil is as effective as fish oil despite the fact that it contains less EPA and DHA.v This is because krill oil is absorbed up to 10-15 times as well as fish oil, due to its molecular composition, and is less prone to oxidation (rancidity) because it is naturally complexed with the potent fat-soluble antioxidant astaxanthin.\n\n3. Sleep\n\nSleep is not only essential for regenerating your physical body, but it is imperative for reaching new mental insights and being able to see new creative solutions to old problems. Sleep removes the blinders and helps \"reset\" your brain to look at problems from a different perspective, which is crucial to creativity.\n\nResearch from Harvard indicates that people are 33 percent more likely to infer connections among distantly related ideas after sleeping, but few realize that their performance has actually improved. Sleep is also known to enhance your memories and help you \"practice\" and improve your performance of challenging skills. In fact, a single night of sleeping only four to six hours can impact your ability to think clearly the next day.\n\nThe process of growth, known as plasticity, is believed to underlie the brain's capacity to control behavior, including learning and memory. Plasticity occurs when neurons are stimulated by events, or information, from the environment. However, sleep and sleep loss modify the expression of several genes and gene products that may be important for synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, certain forms of long-term potentiation, a neural process associated with the laying down of learning and memory, can be elicited in sleep, suggesting synaptic connections are strengthened while you slumber.\n\nAs you might suspect, this holds true for infants too, and research shows that naps can give a boost to babies' brainpower. Specifically, infants who slept in between learning and testing sessions had a better ability to recognize patterns in new information, which signals an important change in memory that plays an essential role in cognitive development.vi Even among adults, a mid-day nap was found to dramatically boost and restore brainpower.vii You can find 33 tips to help you get the shut-eye you need here.\n\n4. Coconut Oil\n\nOne of the primary fuels your brain needs is glucose, which is converted into energy. Your brain actually manufactures its own insulin to convert glucose in your bloodstream into the food it needs to survive.\n\nIf your brain's production of insulin decreases, your brain literally begins to starve, as it's deprived of the glucose-converted energy it needs to function normally. This Fortunately or ketoacids. Ketones are what your body produces when it converts fat (as opposed to glucose) into energy, and a primary source of ketone bodies are the medium chain triglycerides (MCT) found in coconut oil! Coconut oil contains about 66 percent MCTs. Therapeutic levels of MCTs have been studied at 20 grams per day. According to research by Dr. Mary NewportEveryone tolerates coconut oil differently, so you may have to start slowly and build up to these therapeutic levels. My recommendation is to start with one teaspoon, taken with food in the mornings. Gradually add more coconut oil every few days until you are able to tolerate four tablespoons. Coconut oil is best taken with food, to avoid upsetting your stomach.\n\n5. Vitamin D\n\nActivated vitamin D receptors increase nerve growth in your brain, and researchers have also located metabolic pathways for vitamin D in the hippocampus and cerebellum of the brain, areas that are involved in planning, processing of information, and the formation In older adults, too, research has shown that low vitamin D levels are associated with poorer brain function, and increasing levels may help keep older adults mentally fit.viii\n\nAppropriate sun exposure would take care of these issues, as the sun is irreplaceable when it comes to the body's ability to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D.\n\nAppropriate sun exposure is all it takes to keep your levels where they need to be for healthy brain function. If this is not an option, a safe tanning bed is the next best alternative, followed by a vitamin D3 supplement. It now appears as though most adults need about 8,000 IU's of vitamin D a day in order to get their serum levels above 40 ng\/ml, which is the lowest they should be. Ideally,vitamin d levels\n\n6. Optimize Your Gut Flora\n\nYour gut is your \"second brain,\" and your gut bacteria transmits information to your brain via the vagus nerve, the tenth cranial nerve that runs from your brain stem into your enteric nervous system (the nervous system of your gastrointestinal tract). There is a close connection between abnormal gut flora and abnormal brain development, and just as you have neurons in your brain, you also have neurons in your gut -- including neurons that produce neurotransmitters like serotonin, which is also found in your brain and is linked to mood.\n\nQuite simply, your gut health can impact your brain function, psyche, and behavior, as they are interconnected and interdependent in a number of different ways.\n\nYour gut bacteria are an active and integrated part of your body, and as such are heavily dependent on your diet and vulnerable to your lifestyle. If you consume a lot of processed foods and sweetened drinks, for instance, your gut bacteria are likely going to be severely compromised because processed foods in general will destroy healthy microflora and sugars of all kinds feed bad bacteria and yeast. Limiting sugar and processed foods, while eating traditionally fermented foods (rich in naturally occurring good bacteria), taking a probiotic supplement and breastfeeding your baby are among the best ways to optimize gut flora and subsequently support brain health.\n\nDownload Interview Transcript\n\n7. Vitamin B12 According to the latest research, people with high levels of markers for vitamin B12 deficiency were more likely to score lower on cognitive tests, as well as have a smaller total brain volume,ix which suggests a lack of the vitamin may contribute to brain shrinkage.\n\nMental fogginess and problems with memory are two of the top warning signs that you have vitamin B12 deficiency, and this is indicative of its importance for your brain health.\n\nIn addition, a Finnish study found that people who consume foods rich in B12 may reduce their risk of Alzheimer's in their later years.x For each unit increase in the marker of vitamin B12 (holotranscobalamin) the risk of developing Alzheimer's was reduced by 2 percent. Research also shows that supplementing with B vitamins, including B12, helps to slow brain atrophy in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment (brain atrophy is a well-established characteristic of Alzheimer's disease).xi\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency is widespread and many have trouble absorbing this nutrient properly from food sources. Blood tests for vitamin B12 are not always a reliable indicator of B12 status, so watching for symptoms of deficiency and increasing your dietary and supplemental intake is a practical alternative to blood testing.\n\nB12 is available in its natural form only in animal food sources. These include seafood, beef, chicken, pork, milk, and eggs. If you don't consume enough of these animal products (and I don't recommend consuming seafood unless you know it is from a pure water source) to get an adequate supply of B12, or if your body's ability to absorb the vitamin from food is compromised, vitamin B12 supplementation is completely non-toxic and inexpensive, especially when compared to the cost of laboratory testing. I recommend an under-the-tongue fine mist spray, as this technology helps you absorb the vitamin into the fine capillaries under your tongue.\n\n8. Listen to Music\n\nIt's long been theorized that listening to music may boost your brainpower; you've probably heard of this with the \"Mozart Effect,\" which suggests listening to classical music can make you smarter. Indeed, research has shown that listening to music while exercising boosted cognitive levels and verbal fluency skills in people diagnosed with coronary artery disease (coronary artery disease has been linked to a decline in cognitive abilities). In this study, signs of improvement in the verbal fluency areas more than doubled after listening to music compared to that of the non-music session.xii\n\nListening to music has also been associated with enhanced cognitive functioning and improved mental focus among healthy adults, so take advantage of this simple pleasure whenever you can.\n\n9. Challenge Your Mind\n\nOne of the simplest methods to boost your brain function is to keep on learning. The size and structure of neurons and the connections between them actually change as you learn. This can take on many forms above and beyond book learning to include activities like traveling, learning to play a musical instrument or speak a foreign language, or participating in social and community activities.\n\nAnother important method? Brain aerobics. As with learning, challenging your brain with mind-training exercises can keep your brain fit as you age. This can be something as simple as thinking of famous people whose first names begin with the letter A, doing crossword puzzles or playing board games that get you thinking. Research has even shown that surfing the Web activates regions in your brain related to decision-making and complex reasoning.xiii So unlike passively watching TV, using the Internet is an engaging task that may actually help to improve your brainpower.\n\nDr Mercola does not like GMO foods by Monsanto, at all. Today a disclosure regarding Kashi foods by Kellogg, etc:\n\nBy Dr. Mercola\n\nA simple sign on a grocery store shelf has gone viral, causing a storm of outrage among consumers who feel they've been misled by cereal maker Kellogg's claims about its Kashi cereals. A Rhode Island grocer posted a note on the shelf where Kashi was supposed to be, saying he'd learned it wasn't 100 percent natural after all, and therefore wasn't carrying it anymore.\n\nIt turns out the soy in Kashi cereals comes from genetically modified Roundup-ready soybeans, which have a gene inserted in them that allows the crop to withstand otherwise lethal doses of the weed killer.\n\nUSA Today reported that consumers felt duped into believing that Kashi was all-natural when it's noti. Their complaints were initially brushed off by Kashi general Manager David DeSouza, who told USA Today that since the FDA doesn't regulate the term \"natural,\" the cereal maker has done nothing wrong by defining \"natural\" as minimally-processed with no artificial flavors, colors, preservatives or sweeteners.\n\nWere You Duped by Kashi's Wholesome Brand Identity?\n\nPeople generally tend to believe that the word \"natural\" refers to foods grown \"in a natural way,\" which really amounts to organic farming methods, or close to it; sans harsh chemicals, and most definitely not something that has been genetically engineered. Unfortunately, that's not what the \"natural\" label represents at all. In fact, the \"natural\" label is unregulated, and companies can define it as they please.\n\nBut most food manufacturers are well aware of this general misperception of what the label means, and frequently misuse it to lure health conscious consumers into spending more. This is known as \"green-washing\" and it certainly applies in this case.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the company appears to have made a poor attempt to save face by further misleading consumers about the accuracy of the information that led the Rhode Island grocer to not carry the Kashi brand anymore.\n\nThe Cornucopia Institute released a report, Cereal Crimes, back in November of last yearii, which details the presence of genetically engineered grains in a number of leading \"natural\" cereal brands, including Kellogg's Kashi brand. Shockingly, many of the products tested were found to contain high amounts of genetically engineered grains\u2014some, including Kashi, containing 100 percent genetically engineered grains!\n\nThe report also mentions a class action lawsuit filed against Kellogg\/Kashi on August 31, 2011, \"for allegedly misleading consumers with its \"natural\" claims. One Kashi\u00ae product in particular, GoLean\u00ae Shakes, is composed almost entirely of synthetic and unnaturally processed ingredients, according to the plaintiff.\"\n\nThe report contrasts these findings with tests of certified organic cereal products, which by law are not allowed to contain any genetically engineered ingredients or synthetic pesticides. While some were found to be mildly contaminated with genetically engineered ingredients, overall, the report highlights the fact that the ONLY way to ensure you're not buying a genetically engineered product is to buy a product bearing the USDA 100% Organic label.\n\nWhen Greenwashing Attempts Finally Backfire...\n\nOnce the grocer's sign went viral and angry consumers began overloading the Kashi telephone lines, the company switched to a recorded message stating they were temporarily unable to accept calls. Then, according to an April 26 report by Cornucopia Instituteiii:\n\n\"When the company again began accepting calls, a Kashi consumer affairs employee, Rick Duran, told a Cornucopia staff member that \"no actual testing\" of their cereal products had been performed. This mimicked the analysis also offered in a response by the company in an online video posted that same afternoon on the Kashi Facebook page. The video spokesperson called Cornucopia's information \"scientifically inaccurate and misleading because it was not based on actual testing of Kashi products.\"\n\n\"This characterization of our work by Kashi is blatantly false,\" said Will Fantle, Cornucopia's Research Director. \"We purchased a readily available box of Kashi's GoLean\u00ae cereal from a Whole Foods store. We then sent a sample to an accredited national lab for testing, finding that the soy in the natural cereal was 100% GMO.\"\n\nThe Kashi video also suggested, disingenuously, that any genetically engineered contamination in their food was from incidental sources rather than crops intentionally grown from GMO seed. While acknowledging that over 80% of the soybeans grown in North America are GMO, they explain that, \"practices in agricultural storage, handling, and shipping, have lead to an environment where GMOs are not sufficiently controlled.\"\n\n\"This is classic public relations spin and crisis communications work, where corporations use misinformation to try to cover their tracks,\" said Rebekah Wilce, of the Center for Media and Democracy\/PRWatch, which helps expose corporate PR tactics...\"\n\nThree days later, the USA Today reportediv:\n\n\"... Kellogg got itself into trouble by \"not being entirely transparent,\" says Roger Nyhus, president of Nyhus Communications in Seattle. He sees a trend among some companies \"of fudging language to allay consumer concerns and jump on the green bandwagon, and I think it's starting to backfire.\" ... Kashi's DeSouza says that by 2015, all new Kashi products will \"contain at least 70 percent USDA organic certified ingredients.\"\n\nSo, in a matter of days, Kashi ended up backpedaling as their initial attempt to discredit the Cornucopia Institute's test results backfired, and now the company has agreed to ensure their products will, within the next three years, contain at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients. While this is probably not going to be enough for most health conscious consumers, Kashi's pledge is at least a good demonstration of the power of consumer education, and that consumers ultimately have the power to influence even the largest of food companies. After all, they can only sell what you're willing to buy!\n\nThe misuse of the term \"natural\" by companies who simply pay lip service to sustainability and the organic movement undermines companies that are truly sincere in their efforts to bring you eco-friendly, unadulterated, safe foods.\n\nAnd companies like Kashi cannot rightfully claim ignorance about the impact the word \"natural\" has\u2014marketing firm polls have shown that more people respond favorably to the \"all-natural\" label than the organic label! It's a powerful word that conjures up wholesomeness in most people's minds. Marketing terms such as \"natural\" are certainly not chosen willy-nilly. No, they're selected based on what works and what sells. As illustrated by this market research summary by The Hartman Groupv:\n\n\"Consumer understanding and shopping behavior of organic and natural foods and beverages continues to change and evolve. Today's consumers are confused, yet continue to be engaged by the vast array of products, messages, symbols and labels they encounter when making decisions about what to eat or drink and where they shop.\n\n... This study will identify the hierarchy among these attributes and point out differences by product category as well as deeper distinctions between \"organic\" and \"natural\" themselves. It will enable companies to go beyond the clutter of product call-outs to have a singular focus on what matters most to consumers thereby increasing brand loyalty and likelihood of purchase\"\n\nAccording to a 2010 Hartman Group poll, more than 60 percent of consumers erroneously believe that the \"natural\" label implies or suggests the absence of genetically engineered ingredients, so Kashi's statement that there's nothing wrong with using genetically engineered ingredients in their \"natural\" products is rather weak. Food companies know this misconception exists, and they actively prey on consumers' assumptions. Fortunately, the Cornucopia Institute's report has awakened many to this sad truth. As one now-former Kashi consumer stated on the company's Facebook page:\n\n\"Yours is the only brand cereal I have bought for years. Not anymore! You are despicable. Everything you supposedly stand for is a lie.\"\n\nThe Difference Between Natural and Organic\n\nIt's important to understand that the \"natural\" label is not regulated and does not provide a guarantee of being free of genetically engineered ingredients or synthetic pesticides and additives. Currently, the ONLY label that can protect you against genetically engineered ingredients and other unsavory additives is the USDA 100% Organic label.\n\nThe USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) took effect October 21, 2002, and regulates the standards for any farm, wild crop harvesting, or handling operation that wants to sell an agricultural product as organically produced. The labeling requirements of the NOP apply to raw, fresh products and processed products that contain organic agricultural ingredientsvi. In order to qualify as organic, a product must be grown and processed using organic farming methods that recycle resources and promote biodiversity.\n\nCrops must be grown without synthetic pesticides, bioengineered genes, petroleum-based fertilizers, or sewage sludge-based fertilizersvii. Organic livestock must have access to the outdoors and cannot be given antibiotics or growth hormones.\n\nOrganic products cannot be irradiated, are not allowed to contain preservatives or flavor enhancing chemicals, nor can they contain traces of heavy metals or other contaminants in excess of tolerances set by the FDAviii. Additionally, the pesticide residue level cannot be higher than 5 percent of the maximum EPA pesticide toleranceix. For the complete National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances under the USDA organic label, see this linkx. To learn more about organic foods and the findings detailed in the Cereal Crimes report, please listen to my interview with Mark Kastel of the Cornucopia Institute.\n\nDownload Interview Transcript\n\nMom Stands Up to Monsanto and Wins Major Environmental Award\n\nGenetically engineered foods do not just pose a health hazard for those consuming them. GE crops also threaten the health of the environment and those living in GE farming communities, due to the heavy use of pesticides required to grow these crops.\n\nA woman in Argentina who was instrumental in getting the president of Argentina to investigate the connection between pesticide use and the incidence of cancer and other devastating illnesses and deaths in her town has been awarded the 2012 Goldman Environmental Prize\u2014the world's largest prize honoring grassroots environmentalists. The Goldman recognizes unsung heroes who often take great personal risks to work to protect the world's natural resources and human lives.\n\nThirteen years ago Sofia Gatica gave birth to a daughter who died three days later of kidney failure. Determined to learn what killed her child, she learned that the people in her working-class neighborhood, surrounded by genetically engineered soy fields and subjected to regular insecticide spraying, were plagued with unexplained health issues including high rates of neurological and respiratory diseases, birth defects, and infant mortality. Even though she faced an uphill battle and death threats, Gatica succeeded in getting a municipal ordinance passed prohibiting aerial spraying around her town. Argentina's Supreme Court followed with a ruling that not only banned chemical spraying near populated areas, but ordered the government and soy producers to prove the chemicals are safe.\n\nThe Devastating Health Effects of Roundup\n\nAs of July 2013, Argentina will no longer allow the use of endulsofan, an off-patent organochlorine insecticide, and Gatica is currently involved with an effort to enact a nationwide ban on glyphosate as well. Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Monsanto's broad-spectrum herbicide Roundup, which is used on all genetically engineered Roundup-Ready crops, which have been genetically altered to withstand otherwise lethal doses of the chemical.\n\nGlyphosatexi. The malformations primarily affected the:\n\n* Skull * Face * Midline and developing brain * Spinal cord\n\nThe amount of glyphosate residue you can be exposed to through food is remarkably high, in terms of being close to the maximum residue limit (MRL) allowed. According to a report in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology, the highest MRL for glyphosate in food and feed products in the EU is 20 mg\/kg. Genetically engineered soybeans have been found to contain residue levels as high as 17 mg\/kg, and malformations in frog and chicken embryos occurred at 2.03 mg\/kg!xiiThat's 10 times lower than the MRL. Other independent scientific research has also found that glyphosate has the potential to cause grave health damage, including a 2009 study that tested formulations of Roundup that were highly diluted (up to 100,000 times or more) on human cells, and even then the cells died within 24 hours.xiii\n\nWhy We MUST Insist on Labeling of Genetically Engineered Foods\n\nLabeling may be the only way to stop the proliferation of genetically engineered foods in the U.S,, but simple petitions will likely fail. We strongly support state initiatives, such as California's ballot initiative to require labeling for genetically engineered foods sold in their state. A coalition of consumer, public health and environmental organizations, food companies, and individuals has already submitted the California Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Act to the State Attorney General, and thousands of volunteers have done an outstanding job collecting the required signatures.\n\nNow, the campaign needs funding. Needless to say, it's going to be an enormous battle, as the biotech industry will outspend us by 100 to 1, if not more, for their propaganda aimed at stopping Californians from voting it into law.\n\nI urge you to participate in the Money Bomb Against Monsanto, which was launched on May 1. By May 26, a broad coalition of food-, farming-, health groups, and organic food manufacturers, will attempt to raise one million dollars (i.e. \"The Money Bomb\") to help get this law passed.\n\nDonations can be made online, via regular snail mail, and over the phone. And to sweeten the deal further, a group of \"Right to Know\" public interest organizations and organic companies have pledged to match the first million dollars raised in this nationwide \"Drop the Money Bomb on Monsanto Campaign.\" So please, help us raise two million dollars to win this historic campaign!\n\nThe first evidence of resveratrol's anti-cancer effects was published in 1997. The findings received great interest from cancer researchers, and many studies have been devoted to this potent antioxidant since then. Resveratrol, which can be found in red wine, red grape skins, fruits, vegetables, legumes and weeds, has been found to have the following actions and functions:\n\nAccording to the review, published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciencesii:\n\n\"The anticancer activities of resveratrol are mediated through modulation of several cell-signaling molecules that regulate cell cycle progression, inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of tumor cells. It has been shown that resveratrol can sensitize resistant cells to chemotherapeutic agents by overcoming one or more mechanisms of chemoresistance. In some tumor cells, however, resveratrol has been shown to act as chemoprotector.\"\n\nThe fact that it can in some cases act as a chemoprotector, meaning, it can reduce the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents, \"present a major caveat for use of resveratrol as a chemosensitizer,\" the authors warn. In an earlier study, the researchers concluded that using resveratrol with the cancer drug Paclitaxel, for example, was detrimental in certain types of cancers, such as breast canceriii.\n\nResveratrol May Help Alleviate Cancer Treatment Side Effects\n\nIn another study from last year, published in the journal Experimental Biology and Medicine, resveratrol was found to help alleviate many of the debilitating side effects of conventional cancer treatmentsiv, such as:\n\nThe authors point out there's mounting evidence indicating that these symptoms are primarily caused by dysregulation of inflammatory pathways in your body. Hence anti-inflammatory compounds that can modulate the inflammatory pathways and influence inflammatory molecules may help improve these symptoms in cancer patients. They name several nutritional agents known to do just that, including:\n\n\"These nutraceuticals are chemically diverse and affect production of various inflammatory cytokines. Extensive research in recent years has indicated that chronic inflammation leads to various chronic disorders associated with cancer. A central role in the induction of chronic inflammation is played by a set of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNFa and monocyte chemotactic protein 1. What is common to all these molecules is that they are regulated by the transcription factor NFkB. This makes NFkB an appealing target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nA number of compounds have been identified that can suppress NFkB activation, including antioxidants, protease inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, salicylates, immunosuppressants and anti-inflammatory agents.\" [Emphasis mine]\n\nThis brings us to the next interesting fact about natural products like resveratrol and curcumin, namely their impact on your genetic expression. As just mentioned, your genetic expression plays a central role in chronic inflammation, and certain nutrients can have a potent protective influence by either turning genes on or off.\n\nUnderstanding Epigenetics\n\nThe role of epigenetics in health and disease is becoming ever clearer, and I firmly believe this field of study will eventually supplant the current medical paradigm. The conventional belief has been that genes controlled their own expression and were therefore the direct cause of certain diseases. This laid the groundwork for the idea that your genes predetermined your health.\n\nBut genes are in fact NOT self-regulating. Having \"bad genes,\" does not at all mean you're doomed to suffer some inevitable fate like cancer!\n\nGenes are merely blueprints, and these blueprints are activated and controlled by something else entirely, namely their environment. This environmental information\u2014which includes diet, toxic exposures, as well as thoughts and emotions, and more\u2014can create more than 30,000 different variations from each blueprint, allowing for an astounding amount of leeway in modifying the expression or \"read-out\" of each gene. As a result of these findings, we're now finally seeing science alter its course to investigate the power of optimal nutrition to improve health and prevent chronic disease from occurring in the first place.\n\nIn May last year, a study investigating curcumin's ability to affect epigenetic regulation was published in the journal Genes & Nutritiovi. The authors write:\n\n\"Epigenetic regulation, which includes changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and alteration in microRNA (miRNA) expression without any change in the DNA sequence, constitutes an important mechanism by which dietary components can selectively activate or inactivate gene expression.\n\nCurcumin, a component of the golden spice Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, has recently been determined to induce epigenetic changes... [E]pigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and resveratrol, have [also] been shown to alter epigenetic mechanisms, which may lead to increased sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional agents and thus inhibition of tumor growth.\" [Emphasis mine]\n\nCurcumin\u2014A Potent Anti-Cancer Herb\n\nCurcumin currently has the most evidence-based literature supporting its use against cancer among all nutrientsvii. Interestingly this also includes the metabolite of curcumin and its derivatives, which are also anti-cancerous. Best of all, curcumin appears to be safe in the treatment of all cancers, and has been shown to be nontoxic. Researchers have found that curcumin can affect more than 100 different pathways, once it gets into the cell. More specifically, curcumin has been found to:\n\nInhibit the proliferation of tumor cells Decrease inflammation Inhibit the transformation of cells from normal to tumor Inhibit the synthesis of a protein thought to be instrumental in tumor formation Help your body destroy mutated cancer cells so they cannot spread throughout your body Help prevent the development of additional blood supply necessary for cancer cell growth (angiogenesis) Have chemosensitization activity Have radiosensitization activity\n\nAnother study from last year, published in the Natural Product Reports describes curcumin as being therapeutic for a wide range of diseases aside from cancerviii, such as:\n\nA persistent question has been: How can a single agent possess such diverse effects? Part of the answer lies in the herb's ability to affect signaling molecules. For example, curcumin has been shown to directly interact with:\n\n\"The molecular basis of a disease is related to dysregulation of an array of signaling molecules. With the advent of advanced molecular tools, we now know that over 500 different genes of the signaling pathways control any given disease. However, most currently available treatments are based on the modulation of a specific single target. Curcumin is a functionally labile molecule with the potential to modulate the biological activity of a number of signaling molecules either indirectly or directly...\" [Emphasis mine]\n\nHow to Use Curcumin\n\nTo get the full benefits curcumin has to offer you need to understand that it is very poorly absorbed. You simply can't blindly choose a supplement and expect to achieve the results described in this paper. There is extensive research going on by a number of organizations to provide a commercial product.\n\nYou can look for a turmeric extract that contains 100 percent certified organic ingredients, with at least 95 percent curcuminoidsUnfortunately, at the present time there really are no concentrated commercial formulations available for the use against cancer. Keep in mind that concentrated curcumin is really only needed by people who seek to use it as a drug, in which case you need it in very high doses in order to achieve therapeutic effect. The most classic case would be those using it to treat, not prevent, cancer. If you do not have cancer, then using a turmeric supplement is sufficient.\n\nAccording to Dr. William LaValley, one of the leading medicine cancer physicians I personally know, typical anticancer doses are up to three grams of good bioavailable curcumin extract, three to four times daily. One work-around is to use the curcumin powder and make a microemulsion of it by combining a tablespoon of the powder and mixing it into 1-2 egg yolks and a teaspoon or two of melted coconut oil. Then use a high speed hand blender to emulsify the powder.\n\nAnother strategy that can help percent solution that you can drink once it has cooled down. It will have a woody taste. The curcumin will gradually fall out of solution however. In about six hours it will be a 6 percent solution, so it's best to drink the water within four hours. Dr. LaValley is also helping us beta test new curcumin preparations that will radically simplify this process.\n\nCancer Prevention 101...\n\nIt is certainly encouraging to see cancer research on herbs such as turmeric, and antioxidants like resveratrol. However, it's virtually impossible to discuss cancer prevention and treatment without touching on one of the absolute best cancer prevention nutrients ever discovered, namely vitamin D.\n\nAs a powerful neuro-regulatory steroid, vitamin D is likely more potent than curcumin, as its epigenetic influence covers more than 2,000 genes in your body\u2014or about 10 percent of all genes! There are also more than 830 peer reviewed scientific studies showing vitamin D's effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of cancer. In terms of protecting against cancer, vitamin D has been found to offer protection in a number of ways, including:\n\n*Personally, I believe it is virtually malpractice to not optimize vitamin D levels when treating someone with cancer. In this case, your vitamin D levels should be around 70-100 ng\/ml. For more information about optimizing your vitamin D levels, please see my previous article Test Values and Treatment for Vitamin D Deficiency.\n\nIf the notion that sun exposure can actually help prevent cancer is still new to you, I highly recommend you watch my one-hour vitamin D lecture to clear up any confusion. It's important to understand that the risk of skin cancer from the sun comes only from excessive exposure. Meanwhile, countless people around the world have an increased risk of cancer because their vitamin D levels are too low from lack of sun exposure.\n\nOther Natural (and Epigenetic) Cancer Prevention Strategies\u2014all of which help promote a healthful biological environment in which your cells can thrive and combat disease naturally.\n\nYou don't read or hear much about these strategies because they have not been formally \"proven\" yet by conservative researchers. Beyond what's already been covered above, the remainder of my cancer prevention strategies include:\n\n1. Reduce or eliminate your processed food, fructose and grain carbohydrate intake. 2. 3. Normalize your ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fats by taking a high-quality krill oil or fish oil and reducing your intake of most processed vegetable oils. 4. Get regular exercise. One of the primary ways exercise lowers your risk for cancer is by reducing elevated insulin levels, which creates a low sugar environment that discourages the growth and spread of cancer cells. Peak Fitness exercises are your best bet but ideally you should have a good strength training program as well. 5. Get regular, good quality sleep. 6. Reduce your exposure to environmental toxins like pesticides, household chemical cleaners, synthetic air fresheners and air pollution. 7. Reduce your exposure to environmental toxins like pesticides, household chemical cleaners, synthetic air fresheners and air pollution. 8.x 9. Avoid frying or charbroiling your food. Boil, poach or steam your foods instead. 10. 11. Eat at least one-third of your diet in the form of raw food.\n\nToday Dr M warns about pneumonia vaccinations. My daughter recently had a baby, and the hospital folk pushed her to have this shot. She did, and her shoulder where the shot went in became inflamed and so sore she could hardly sleep. After a number of days, the pain and swelling finally subsided.\n\nAs Dr M says below,\n\nIt is important for you to be brave because you might be strongly criticized for daring to talk about the \"other side\" of the vaccine story.\n\n_____ By Dr. Mercola\n\nIt's estimated that nearly one in 7 U.S. adults have been diagnosed with sinusitis in the past 12 months, which occurs when the mucous membranes in your nose and sinuses become irritated.i In most of these cases (90-98%) a virus is the cause, whereas in 2-10% of cases, a bacterial infection is also present.\n\nThese bacterial infections are becoming increasingly drug-resistant and therefore harder and harder to treat, which is why the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently issued new treatment guidelines for sinusitis.\n\nAlarmingly, however, buried on page 16 of their report is the acknowledgement that certain hard-to-treat bacterial infections in children are on the rise because of the widespread use of the conjugated pneumococcal vaccines!\n\nBacterial Infections on the Rise Since Introduction of the Pneumonia Vaccine\n\nThe IDSA report states:ii\n\n\" ... both the prevalence of H. influenzae (40%\u2013 45%) and proportion of b-lactamase\u2013producing H. influenzae (37%\u201350%) (extrapolated from middle ear fluid cultures of children with acute otitis media) have markedly increased among other upper respiratory tract infections since the widespread use of conjugated pneumococcal vaccines... Whereas S. pneumoniae was more common than H. influenzae prior to 2000, the prevalence of H. influenzae has clearly increased while that of S. pneumoniae has decreased in the post\u2013pneumococcal vaccine era, such that currently they are approximately equal \u2026 \"\n\nIn the United States the Prevnar vaccine, which is used to prevent pneumoccocal disease that can cause meningitis and bloodstream infections in young children, was licensed in 2000 and has been given to infants in four shots between the age of 2 months and 15 months. The vaccine originally covered seven and now covers 13 of the 90-odd strains of the Streptococcus bacteria.\n\nAlthough pneumoccocal disease caused by seven pneumoccoal strains in the 7-valent Prevnar vaccine declined after widespread use, one pneumoccocal strain called 19A developed super resistance and is now causing pneumoccocal disease that is antibiotic-resistant.\n\nIn 2010, the FDA licensed a 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine to cover more strains, including 19A, in an attempt to interrupt transmission of pneumococcal disease, which is associated with over 80 different strains of pneumococcal. The health community has known for years that non-vaccine S. pneumoniae serotypes had not only quickly replaced the seven included in the original Prevnar vaccine, but were also causing invasive non-vaccine-type pneumonia to increase by 71 percent. Writing in the journal Emerging Infectious Disease, researchers stated:iii\n\nThat's the reason U.S. officials introduced the new 13-valent pneumonia vaccine\u2014to hopefully keep the replacement serotypes at bay. However, history suggests that both antibiotics and vaccines may be intricately involved in the evolution of pneumonia superbugs.\n\nPneumonia Bacteria Swapped Genes Before Prevnar Hit the Market\n\nA new analysis by a team of international researchers revealed the complete genetic makeup of 240 samples of a strain of Streptococcus pneumonia taken between 1984-2008, which allowed the researchers to note changes over time.iv The strain, known as the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network clone 1 or PMEN1, is resistant to several antibiotics. There were several interesting revelations, including:\n\n* The pneumonia strain emerged when penicillin was frequently used, but because it was not killed by penicillin, it flourished * The strain changes one of its DNA nucleotides about every 15 weeks, a rate of mutation similar to that of the common antibiotic-resistant superbug MRSA * One way the bacteria mutate is with a sugar coating called a polysaccharide capsule; PMEN1 has a capsule called 23F, which was included as a target in the Prevnar vaccine. However, by the time the vaccine hit the market, the bacteria had already morphed into a new serotype called 19A, which the vaccine did not work against.\n\nWired Science reported:v\n\n\"The study \"illustrates that these genes are under enormous selection pressure due to human interference with antibiotics and vaccines,\" says Garth Ehrlich, a bacterial pathologist at the Allegheny-Singer Research Institute in Pittsburgh. Mapping the organism's past genetic contortions may not help researchers predict what the bacteria will do next, but the analysis shows that some genes are particularly prone to changes and probably are not good vaccine targets, he says.\"\n\nA secondary problem is that the overuse of antibiotics for ear and sinus infections has also caused these serotypes to become resistant to antibiotics. Researchers reported in Science:vi\n\n\"More than 700 recombinations were detected, with genes encoding major antigens frequently affected. Among these were 10 capsule-switching events, one of which accompanied a population shift as vaccine-escape serotype 19A isolates emerged in the USA after the introduction of the conjugate polysaccharide vaccine. The evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolones, rifampicin, and macrolides [antibiotics] was observed to occur on multiple occasions.\"\n\nWill Vaccines Leave a Legacy of Superbugs and Diseases?\n\nVaccines carry health risks and do not guarantee protection against contracting infectious disease. In the case of Prevnar, no long-term studies were conducted to evaluate whether it is associated with development of chronic illness or disability. And the clinical trials that were conducted by the vaccine manufacturer before the Prevnar 7 vaccine was licensed in 2000, compared one experimental vaccine (pneumococcal) against another (meningococcal), which means no true placebo was used in a control group, compromising the results. Still, children in the pneumococcal vaccine group had more seizures, high fevers and other reactions, and there were 12 deaths (including 5 labeled as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)) reported in the pre-licensing clinical trials.\n\nEach dose of Prevnar vaccine contains aluminum as an adjuvant, which is used to provoke a strong immune response but is also a known neurotoxin.vii\n\nNow it's being suggested that widespread use of the Prevnar vaccine is leading to other unforeseen consequences, like increases in bacterial infections and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant supergerms. Other vaccines also have produced serious, unintended adverse effects, such as the chicken pox vaccine, which can increase the risk of adult shingles.\n\nIt's so important to understand that your best defense against any disease is a robust healthy immune system. Vaccines can actually compromise your immune function, and this is true regardless of your age. Two of the most important factors influencing the health of your immune system are:\n\n* Your gut flora * Your vitamin D status\n\nAbout 80 percent of your immune system resides in your gut, so maintaining a healthy gut flora is imperative for maintaining a fully functioning immune system. Also, if your child's gut is populated with too many pathogens, he or she is likely to be more prone to vaccine-induced damage. For more information about this, I highly recommend listening to my interview with Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride.\n\nVitamin D is another crucial component for maintaining optimal health, so I urge you to get your children's vitamin D levels tested, and, if found deficient, to follow my recommendations for optimizing their levels.\n\nArtificially manipulating your immune system with a vaccine does not produce the same kind of lasting immunity and sought after disease-fighting results that a healthy lifestyle can. It may actually make you less healthy in the long run.\n\nFor more information about vaccines, vaccine ingredients and vaccine policies and state laws, the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is a good place to start to do research and obtain information that you need to help you make intelligent, informed decisions about vaccination.\n\nShare Your Story with the Media and People You Know\n\nThe media is quick to warn about the dangers of infectious diseases but rarely discuss the dangers of the vaccines against those diseases. This has created a very lopsided view of the safety of vaccines. So please, if you or a family member has suffered a serious vaccine reaction, injury or death, talk about it. If we don't share information and experiences with each other, everybody feels alone and afraid to speak up. Write a letter to the editor if you have a different perspective on a vaccine story that appears in your local newspaper, or make a call in to a radio talk show that is only presenting one side of the vaccine story. It is important for you feel comfortable talking about these critical health issuesTo learn more about informed consent, the six principles for protecting your vaccine choices, and a summary of the U.S. law pertaining to vaccine exemptions, please review the article, STOP!

These two forms of exercise may at first sound like complete opposites\u2014super-slow versus high-intensity\u2014but the combination of slowing down your lifts and lifting to failure turns it into a high-intensity exercise. Metabolically speaking, both forms are very similar to each other, because you're producing metabolic byproducts of that fatigue.\n\nOne of the primary differences is that during anaerobic interval training, these metabolic adaptations occur as a side effect of the activity\u2014I've previously discussed how these types of exercises help boost and shape muscles throughout your body\u2014but during super-slow weight training, these adaptations are a deliberate part of the goal of the exercise, which is to momentarily bring a given muscle group into deep fatigue in order to increase the strength of that muscle\u2014and to do so within a span of 60 to 120 seconds.\n\nHow much actual muscle mass you gain depends on your individual expression of certain genes. Your genome governs how large your muscles can become, and how responsive your muscles will be to exercise. However, regardless of how large your muscles become, your body will get stronger as a result of these types of exercises. Some people can be enormously strong without looking like Schwarzenegger, and some who are very muscular might not have great strength.\n\nAnother adaptation that occurs is the improvement of your glucose storage capability. Regardless of the increase in actual muscle mass, your glucose storage capability will increase, and that is a very important factor for overall health. And, just like high-intensity interval training, super-slow weight training promotes the production of human growth hormone (HGH), aka \"the fitness hormone,\" which plays an important role in maintaining optimal health, fitness, and longevity. In fact, according to Dr. McGuff you only need 12 minutes of Super-Slow type strength training once a week to achieve the same growth hormone production as you would with Peak Fitness!\n\nHow to Perform Super-Slow Weight Lifting\n\nTo summarize, by aggressively working your muscle to fatigue, you stimulate muscular adaptations that improve the metabolic capability of your muscle, which causes it to increase in strength and size.\n\nDr. McGuff recommends using four or five basic compound movements for your exercise set. These exercises can be done using either free weights or machines. The benefit of using a quality machine is that it will allow you to focus your mind on the effort rather than your form. The following five movements are a good place to start:\n\nNext is a summary of how to perform each exercise. If you're using the appropriate amount of weight or resistance, you'll be able to perform four to eight repetitions for each exercise set. When done properly, your workout will take no more than 12 or 15 minutes.\n\n1. Begin by lifting the weight as slowly and gradually as you can. The first inch should take about two seconds. Since you're depriving yourself of all the momentum of snatching the weight upward, it will be very difficult to complete the full movement in less than 7-10 seconds.\n\nThis super-slow movement allows your muscle, at the microscopic level, to access the maximum number of cross-bridges between the protein filaments that produce movement in the muscle. When pushing, stop about 10 to 15 degrees before your limb is fully straightened; smoothly reverse direction 2. Slowly lower the weight back down 3. Repeat until exhaustion. Once you reach exhaustion, don't try to heave or jerk the weight to get one last repetition in. Instead, just keep trying to produce the movement, even if it's not 'going' anywhere, for another five seconds or so 4. Immediately switch to the next exercise for the next target muscle group and repeat the first three steps\n\nWhen Pushing to the Point of Failure is Just Too Muchii... [T]he CNS [central nervous system] regulates exercise specifically to insure that each exercise bout terminates whilst homeostasis is retained in all bodily systems.\" [Emphasis mine.]The Importance of Recovery\n\nThe idea that fatigue is an important regulatory function to maintain physical homeostasis makes the advice to make sure you fully recover between workouts even more important. This recently became a great learning experience for me.\n\nThis is a vital area of exercise and one that obsessive-compulsives like me frequently have problems with. It took me over 40 years to realize that I was working out too hard and needed to integrate more recovery into my exercise program. Obviously this is not a problem for most people that don't exercise enough but for disciplined overachievers, this is a common misunderstanding.\n\nI'd been doing high-intensity Peak Fitness exercises three times a week for about a year along with three one-hour strength training sessions a week when I began feeling fatigued between sessions. After my interview with Dr. McGuff, I realized I was probably pushing myself too hard and not allowing myself enough recovery time.\n\nSo when should you back down on your exercise?\n\nAn important piece of information gleaned from Dr. McGuff is that as long as your intensity is high enough, you can cut back on the frequency of the exercise without diminishing the results. In fact, if the intensity is really high, the frequency may need to be reduced, in order to continue improving.\n\n\"For any interval increase in intensity, there has to be a very disproportionate decrease in frequency for it to continue to be productive,\" he explains.\n\nFor example, as a weak beginner, you can exercise three times a week and not put much stress on your system. But once your strength and endurance improves, each exercise session is placing an increasingly greater amount of stress on your body (as long as you keep pushing yourself to the max). At that point, you would be wise to reduce the frequency of your sessions to give your body enough time to recover in between.\n\nAccording to Dr. McGuff, once you're fit, you don't need the frequent spurts of growth hormone production. At that point, recovery takes precedence as being more important, and your recovery period could be anywhere from three to seven days. In fact, he strongly recommends NOT exercising too frequently once you are in fit condition, in order to avoid over-taxing your adrenals.\n\nSuper-Slow Weight Training Automatically Decreases Risk of Injury\n\nSince we're discussing your body's innate intelligence to prevent you from injuring yourself, by making you feel fatigued, it's worth mentioning that super-slow weight training is a much safer form of exercise than regular strength training. The slow movement actively prevents you from accidentally harming your joints or suffering repetitive use injury, as the forces are dramatically reduced.\n\nThe media often plays a powerful role in influencing public perceptions of controversial issues like genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\nAnd many believe that newspapers and other media outlets provide an unbiased, independent source of information that often reflects public opinion.\n\nIn China, where debate is growing over the use of genetically modified (GM) seeds, research has revealed that newspaper coverage about GMOs is largely positive, a stance that may be misleading over a billion residents, as well as people around the globe, in implying that China is pro-GMO.\n\nChinese Media Portrays GMOs as Positive -- But Government Has Other Ideas\n\nAfter reviewing 77 articles from two major Chinese newspapers, published between 2002 and August 2011, researchers noted that \"the Chinese print media is largely supportive of GMOs.\"i Benefits of GM crops were discussed far more often than risks, which were actually only minimally covered, and one of the newspapers even wrote that public concerns about GM rice were \"fallacious\" and based on \"the public's ignorance about biotechnology and the loss of confidence in government authority.\"\n\nThe media also highlighted the government's role, including describing the Chinese government as \"actively pursuing national GMO research and development programs and the promotion of GM cotton usage.\"\n\nThis may sound as though China is rearing to become the next GMO superpower, but this is only part of the picture, which is why the study's authors concluded that the media, scientists and the government should work together to ensure that science communication is accurate and balanced. The Chinese media should take heed of this advice, seeing that their government drafted a plan February 21, 2012 that outlaws genetically modified grains.\n\nChina Says No to GMO Grains\n\nA source close to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), told the Economic Observer that the Chinese government \"will not promote the commercialization of genetically modified rice and wheat for five to ten years.\"ii This was based on two primary reasons:\n\n* Questions about the safety of genetic modification * Research on GM staple food crops in China, as well as regulations, business operations and more, are not yet mature\n\nIt's a smart move, especially considering the Chinese government's decision followed the European Union's (EU) announcement in November 2011 that the EU was requiring all Chinese rice to be certified 100 percent GM-free. This came in response to the EU's border control warning system \u2013 the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, which had 47 alerts about the presence of GM rice in Chinese imports in 2010 alone. Currently, the EU allows only two GM crops to be planted (a corn variety and a potato variety), although only a minimal number of states actually allow it.\n\nAnd though they do allow imports of 43 GM products grown elsewhere \u2013 GM rice is not one of them.iii\n\nAs rice imports from China became increasingly contaminated with GM varieties (some of which are not even authorized in China), the EU took a more rigid measure in requiring that all such imports be certified as meeting EU GM-free rice standards. In China, currently papayas, tomatoes and bell peppers are the only commercially produced GM crops. GM rice is illegal in the country, but GM rice contaminants have been reported since 2005. As for GM corn, China is currently considering commercial planting, but other countries are taking a much more cautious stance \u2026\n\nPoland Bans BT Corn\n\nPoland is the latest country to ban a GM food, in a desperate attempt to save the world's bees. Citing a link to Monsanto's GM corn and the depletion of bee colonies in the country, Poland banned the insecticide-producing MON810 corn after experts determined that the widely used insecticide may be causing colony collapse disorder. Scientists know that honeybees play a critical role in the pollination process, and that their decline could threaten the sustainability of the world's agricultural ecosystems and food supply.\n\nIt's also the reason Ingram went to great lengths to buy bees and hives only from areas that had never been affected by Roundup. But when Ingram approached the Illinois Department of Agriculture about his concerns, instead of confirming that Roundup destroys bees, the department swooped down on his hives while he was gone, destroyed many of them and stole the rest, ruining his livelihood and 15 years of research!\n\nPoland is the seventh European nation to announce plans to ban Monsanto's Bt corn. France recently announced they were banning it too, along with Austria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, and Luxembourg. The European Commission, which regulates environmental decisions made in Europe, ruled France's ban as illegal in 2011, and the country subsequently overturned it in March 2012, saying it was essential to \"protect the environment.\"\n\nNow, however, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has said, again, that it will force France to lift the ban, saying there is \"no scientific evidence\" that shows \"risk to human and animal health or the environment\" (which is clearly not true). There is much more to this battle than meets the eye; in a leaked WikiLeaks cable from 2007, Craig Stapleton, who was the U.S. ambassador to France at the time, comments on France's decision to ban cultivation of GM corn. ...This is pretty much conclusive proof that the U.S. government is working toward Monsanto's pro-GM goals, and it may now be having an impact in the European Union. Fortunately, Poland's agriculture minister said European law allows for a national ban, and his country intends to go through with it. Polish law already forbids the trading of GMO seeds; it is the cultivation of them\u2014which specifically is not yet banned\u2014that Poland is now targeting.\n\nAs the debate over GM safety and ethics grows, other countries are also making a stand. In the Philippines, for instance, Greenpeace and public officials asked the Supreme Court to stop the field testing of a GM variety of Bt eggplant, which they fear could spur the growth of superweeds as well as pose harm to humans. The Supreme Court responded favorably, and it appears Bt eggplant may be permanently banned.\n\nYou Can Make MAJOR Difference In Making Choice Possible and Labeling GMOs\n\nBefore I continue, I want to bring your attention to an issue of great importance, and that is the California ballot initiative to mandate labeling of genetically engineered foods. We only have a few short months left to really shift the tide against genetically engineered foods in the US, and we need your help. This concerns all Americans, not just Californians, because a win for the California Initiative would most likely have the same impact as a national law, due to the size of their market. The initiative has already collected the 800,000 signatures needed to get the Act on this year's ballot. Now it's time to campaign, and the Initiative needs both volunteers and funds to stand a chance against the deep pockets of the biotech industry that does NOT want a labeling requirement for their wares.\n\nI urge you to get involved and help in any way you can:\n\n* If you live in California and want to get involved, please contact LabelGMOs.org. Pamm Larry will go through all volunteer requests to put you into a position that is suitable for you, based on your stated interests and location *\n\nWhy Is a Plague of 'Super Weeds' Taking Over U.S. Farmland?\n\nAn insidious army of \"super weeds\" is taking over U.S. farmlands, and even Monsanto's best-selling herbicide Roundup can't stop it. Actually, it's Roundup, coupled with the excessive planting of Roundup-Ready GM crops, that's caused the problem in the first place. Like the old axiom, \"life finds a way,\" the weeds Roundup targets have found a way to resist Roundup's powerful poisons, making them stronger and more prolific than ever.\n\nIt's a problem that's helped some of the worst weeds grow more than 6 feet tall as they've attacked and taken over more than 12 million acres of prime U.S. farmland, primarily afflicting the very crops Roundup was supposed to protect\u2015corn and soybeans. We'll probably never know whether Monsanto knew in advance that Roundup would only contribute to creating Frankenstein-like super weeds. But now that it's happened, farmers who once embraced the genetically modified Roundup Ready seeds and their companion herbicide are begging for relief and a solution to their woes.\n\nSadly, one of Monsanto's competitors, Dow Chemical, has what they say will \"save\" the GM farming world: a newly formulated herbicide built on the deadly 2,4-D compound, which was a key ingredient in the chemical nightmare known as Agent Orange.\n\nThe Big Lie of Genetic Engineering and Industrial Farming\n\nIf you haven't made up your mind yet about whether genetic engineering is equivalent to crop suicide, then PLEASE watch this short video, which features a grandma in India who is trying to save the environment, and ultimately the world, with natural seeds and ecological farming. The star of this movement is Dr. Vandana Shiva, who founded the Navdanya Biodiversity Farm in India to help save traditional seeds before it's too late.\n\nThis is vitally important because large corporations like Monsanto are genetically modifying the world's seeds and patenting them as their own. These corporations say they're doing it to make farming more sustainable and better able to feed a growing, hungry world. But as Dr. Shiva in her elegant British accent articulately points out, that premise is proving to be nothing but a big fat lie. It's a lie that's been the source of countless suicides committed by Indian farmers who've gone broke from farming GM crops.\n\nVirtually all of the claims of benefit of GM crops \u2013 increased yields, more food production, controlled pests and weeds, reductions in chemical use in agriculture, drought-tolerant seeds \u2013 have not materialized. Last year, The Global Citizens' Report on the State of GMOs,iv revealed:\n\n* Contrary to the claim of feeding the world, genetic engineering has not increased the yield of a single crop. * Herbicide tolerant (Roundup Ready) crops were supposed to control weeds and Bt crops were intended to control pests. Instead of controlling weeds and pests, GE crops have led to the emergence of super weeds and super pests \u2026 Herbicide-resistant crops such as Roundup Ready cotton can create the risk of herbicide resistant \"superweeds\" by transferring the herbicide resistance to weeds. * Despite claims that GMOs * Monsanto has been claiming that through genetic engineering it can breed crops for drought tolerance and other climate-resilient traits. This is a false promise. * Among the false claims made by Monsanto and the Biotechnology industry is that GE foods are safe. However, there are enough independent studies to show that GE foods can cause considerable health damage.\n\nContrary to promises, GM crops are failing miserably all across the world. The reality simply isn't living up to the hype, and it's time to take action now \u2013 before it's too late.\n\nMandatory labeling may be the only way to stop the proliferation of genetically engineered foods in the US, but simple petitions will likely fail. We strongly support state initiatives, such as California's ballot initiative to get mandatory labeling for genetically engineered foods sold in their state. A recent story highlights why state initiatives in particular are so vitally important.\n\nIn a brazen example of how the FDA completely ignores the people it's supposed to listen to and protect, the agency actually decided to eliminate and disregard over a million U.S. citizens' signatures and comments collected by the Just Label It campaignv. Organizers of the campaign said they gathered more than one million signatures of people who want to know what's in the foods they're eating. But the whole effort ended up being for naught as the FDA declared that signatures on form letters don't count.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Tribunevi:\n\n\"The agency says that if 35,000 people, for instance, sign their name to the same form letter it only counts as one person or \"comment.\" And if tens of thousands sign a petition, they are only counted as one \"comment,\" too.\"\n\nTherefore, under the FDA counting method, the one million signatures were whittled down to a measly 394 people asking for labeling... The FDA says it's still considering the issue, and that they would let the Just Label It group know if, and when, they make a decision on whether they would mandate labeling of genetically engineered foods.\n\nProof Positive that GMO Labeling WILL Change the Food Industry\n\nMany don't fully appreciate the strategy of seeking to have genetically engineered foods labeled in California. The belief is that large food companies would refuse to have dual labeling; one for California and another for the rest of the country. It would be very expensive, not to mention a logistical nightmare. To avoid the dual labeling, many would likely opt to not use genetically engineered ingredients in their product, especially if the new label would be the equivalent of a skull and crossbones. This is why we are so committed to this initiative, as victory here will likely eliminate most genetically engineered foods from the US.\n\nPowerful confirmation of this belief occurred in early 2012 when both Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo Inc. chose to alter one of their soda ingredients as a result of California's labeling requirements for carcinogensvii:\n\n\"Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. are changing the way they make the caramel coloring used in their sodas as a result of a California law that mandates drinks containing a certain level of carcinogens bear a cancer warning label. The companies said the changes will be expanded nationally to streamline their manufacturing processes. They've already been made for drinks sold in California.\"\n\nThis is a PERFECT example of the national impact a California labeling mandate can, and no doubt WILL, have. While California is the only state requiring the label to state that the product contains the offending ingredient, these companies are switching their formula for the entire US market, rather than have two different labels.\n\nAccording to USA Today:\n\n\"A representative for Coca-Cola, Diana Garza Ciarlante, said the company directed its caramel suppliers to modify their manufacturing processes to reduce the levels of the chemical 4-methylimidazole, which can be formed during the cooking process and as a result may be found in trace amounts in many foods. \"While we believe that there is no public health risk that justifies any such change, we did ask our caramel suppliers to take this step so that our products would not be subject to the requirement of a scientifically unfounded warning,\" Garza-Giarlante said in an email.\"\n\nLearn More about Genetically Engineered Foods\n\nDue to lack of labeling, many Americans are still unfamiliar with what genetically engineered foods are. We have a plan to change that, and I urge you to participate and to continue learning more about genetically engineered foods and helping your friends and family do the same.\n\nTo start, please print out and use the Non-GMO Shopping Guide, created by the Institute for Responsible Technology. Share it with your friends and family, and post it to your social networks. You can also download a free iPhone application, available in the iTunes store. You can find it by searching for ShopNoGMO in the applications.\n\nYour BEST strategy, however, is to simply buy USDA 100% Organic products whenever possible, (as these do not permit genetically engineered ingredients) or buy whole fresh produce and meat from local farmers.\n\nThe majority of the GMOs any foods containing these two non-organic ingredients are virtually guaranteed to contain genetically engineered ingredients, as well as toxic herbicide residues.\n\nTo learn more about genetically engineered foods, I highly recommend the following films and lectures:\n\nFortunately, 24 U.S. states have (as part of their state governance) something called the Initiative Process, where residents can bring to ballot any law they want enacted, as long as it has sufficient support. California has organized just such a ballot initiative to get mandatory labeling for genetically engineered foods sold in their state. Michigan and Washington are also starting similar campaignsviii. Since California is the 8th largest economy in the world, a win for the California Initiative would be a huge step forward, and would likely affect ingredients and labeling nation-wide.\n\nA coalition of consumer, public health and environmental organizations, food companies, and individuals has already submitted the California Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Actix to the State Attorney General. Thousands of volunteers have already been enlisted, but more are needed. It's going to be an enormous battle, as the biotech industry will outspend us by 100 to 1, if not more, for their propaganda.\n\nNeedless to say, the campaign needs funds. So if you have the ability, I strongly encourage you to make a donation. But they also need more volunteers, because that's how we're going to win this battle. The biotech industry may outdo us in funding ability, but we as consumers still outnumber them. Pamm Larry, the California grandmother who created the initiative, is correct when she says we need to reach every single California community\u2014large and small.\n\nI urge you to get involved and help in any way you can. Be assured that what happens in California will affect the remainder of the U.S. states, so please support this important state initiative, even if you do not live there!\n\n* * Talk to organic producers and stores and ask them to actively support the California Ballot. It may be the only chance we have to label genetically engineered foods. * Dist * For timely updates, please join the Organic Consumers Association on Facebook, or follow them on Twitter. * Look for in-depth coverage of the issue at the Institute for Responsible Technology, subscribe to Spilling the Beans, and check out their Facebook or Twitter.\n\n\"...my eyes beheld the 'BOOK OF MORMON'\u2014that book of books \u2026 which was the principal means, in the hands of God, of directing the entire course of my future life.\" - Parley Pratt\n\nWhat do restaurant menus, hands-free faucets, ATM machines and your physician's scrubs have in common? They are all among the \"germiest\" objects on Earth.\n\nYes, really.\n\nAs much as you might like to give the gold medal to toilet seats when it comes to squeamishly germ-ridden locations, science suggests there are much \"germier\" places that you're probably frequenting daily.\n\nFor example, one study found that each key on an ATM keypad harbors 1,200 germs, including E. coli and cold and flu viruses. The worst button is the \"Enter\" button, because everyone has to touch it. Flu viruses can survive on hard surfaces such as restaurant menus for as long as 18 hours, according to an article in Mental Flossi. Some of the other dirtiest places and objects might surprise you:\n\nWhen you see hospital staff in bright, cheerfully colored scrubs and crisp white lab coats, do you think bacteria? That's exactly what you should think, considering the findings of several recent studies that show hospitals are not the safe, clean environments we'd like them to be.\n\n1. A study published in 2011 in the American Journal of Infection Controlii found that more than 60 percent of healthcare workers' uniforms tested positive for potentially dangerous bacteria, including germs that cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections and drug-resistant infections such as MRSA. The samples were obtained from the sleeves, waists, and pockets of 75 registered nurses and 60 physicians at a busy university-based hospital. Eleven percent of the bugs were resistant to multiple front-line antibiotics. This study suggests healthcare workers' attire may be one surprising route by which pathogenic bacteria are transmitted from staff to patients. 2. Another 2011 studyiii found pathogenic bacteria\u2014including MRSA\u2014on the privacy curtains that separate care spaces in hospitals and clinics. 3. A 2009 studyiv showed that pathogenic microorganisms can even survive on the paper commonly used in clinical settings\u2014so the penicillin script your physician hands you may come with its own colony of dangerous bacteria 4. A 2009 studyv of U.K. nursing homes found 24 percent of residents and seven percent of staff were colonized with MRSA, which means they were carrying the bacteria on their skin (and lab coats) but not showing signs of infection.\n\nRates of MRSA in health care settings have been climbing steadily. Statistically, six out of seven people infected with MRSA contract it at a healthcare facility, where the infection shows up in surgical wounds or around feeding tubes, catheters or other invasive devicesvi. However, these \"super bugs\" are no longer originating only in healthcare facilities. The bacteria are constantly adapting, and now they are being found in livestock that ends up on your dinner plate.\n\nThe \"Farming\" of Super Bugs\n\nToday, as much as 70 percent of all antibiotic use in the United States takes place at concentrated animal feedlot operations (CAFOs), and these factory-scale farms are now brewing a novel strain of MRSA. CAFO animals are often fed antibiotics at low doses to prevent disease and promote growth.\n\nMRSA, short for \"Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus,\" is a very dangerous strain of staph bacteria that has developed resistance to the broad-spectrum antibiotics commonly used to treat it (methicillin, penicillin, oxacillin, amoxicillin, etc.). Initially, these \"super bugs\" were coming exclusively from hospital environments, but they've now adapted and spread to other public settings, such as schools, gyms, and locker rooms. And now a new strain has appeared in livestock animals as a direct result of antibiotic overuse.\n\nExperts are concerned this new MRSA strain in livestock could begin to infect humans all over the globe.\n\nRealizing that antibiotics abuse threatens public health, the U.S. FDA plans to issue new regulations for the use of antibiotics in the livestock industry by requiring a veterinarian's prescription before antibiotics can be given.vii\n\nOther countries have also realized the inherent hazards of antibiotic overuse and have opted for a healthier approach to the raising of livestock. For example, Denmark stopped the widespread use of antibiotics in their pork industry 12 years ago. After they implemented the antibiotic ban, a Danish study later confirmed that Denmark had drastically reduced antibiotic-resistant bacteria in their animals and food. This is one reason why I feel it's so important to support smaller, local farms that raise livestock and poultry without antibiotics, on pastures where the animals graze on natural grasses, as opposed to confined to buildings and fed grains.\n\nBad Bugs, Bad Bugs\u2026 Whatchya Gonna Do?\n\nAs hard as you might try, you simply can't outrun or outsmart the microbes. They're literally everywhere, including all over you as you read this right now. We are their reproductive vectors--they ride around on us and hop from person to person, using us like an interpersonal railway system. Knowing this, how do you live your life without fearing an attack from every mustard bottle or stationary bike handle you come across?\n\nRelax. You don't have to worry, as long as your immune system is in good shape.\n\nWe have shared our lives with the microbial world for many thousands of years, and we will probably do so for millions more. If your defenses are strong, your body will be pretty successful in fighting off invaders. It's only when your immune system is compromised that you're more likely to become ill.\n\nAnd many of these microorganisms are beneficial\u2014even the pathological ones. Some microbial exposure actually makes you stronger by \"training\" your immune system to react appropriately, especially when the exposure occurs in childhood. This concept is known as the \"hygiene hypothesis.\"\n\nThere is evidence that our modern germophobic culture, with hand sanitizers on every shelf, is counterproductive to good health. Science has found that overly sterile environments are linked with higher rates of depression, increased inflammation, heart disease, asthma, allergies, and eczema. That said, some of today's pathogens are quite a bit more dangerous than those present a century ago, so taking some reasonable precautions is advisable. One of the simplest and most effective preventative measures is proper hand washing.\n\nYour Number ONE Defense Against Germs: Proper Hand Washing\n\nGetting back to basics is often the best advice, and that definitely applies here. Good old-fashioned hand washing with plain soap and water is one of the oldest and most powerful antibacterial treatments there is; no harsh disinfectants or antimicrobial soaps required. To make sure you're actually removing the germs when you wash your hands, follow these guidelines: 1. Use warm water 2. Use a mild non-antibacterial soap 3. Work up a good lather, all the way up to your wrists, for at least 10 or 15 seconds 4. Make sure you cover all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, wrists, between your fingers, and around and below your fingernails 5. Rinse thoroughly under running water 6. In public places, use a paper towel to open the door as a protection from germs that the handles may harbor Also remember that your skin is your primary defense against bacteria\u2014not the soap. So resist the urge to become obsessive about washing your hands. Washing too vigorously or too frequently can extract many of the protective oils in your skin, causing it to crack and potentially even bleed, providing germs a point of entry into your body where they can do harm. So mild to moderate washing is really all you need.\n\nAVOID Anti-Bacterial Soaps\n\nYou should especially avoid the use of antibacterial soaps and wipes, especially those containing triclosan and triclocarban, chemicals that can worsen the problem of bacterial resistance. There is also recent evidence that triclosan may disrupt your hormone balance. If you wish to use a hand sanitizer, make sure it's made with safe plant-based ingredients such as rice bran extract, aloe vera, chamomile and tea tree oil, rather than the chemical agents you typically find. Now that you've taken care of your outer defenses, you should pay some attention to your inner defenses\u2014your immune system. My Basic Recipe for Building a Strong Immune System\n\nMaintaining a strong immune system requires following the basic tenets of good health. There is no magic bullet. Staying healthy, or regaining your health, requires some diligence in making good choices about nutrition, exercise, sleep and the rest, over the long term. Good health habits will minimize your risk of getting sick from ANY cause. Manage your stress; science has proven that stress and unresolved emotional issues have lingering adverse effects on your health Optimize your vitamin D level with exposure to sunlight or a safe tanning bed; if this isn't possible, take an oral vitamin D supplement Drink plenty of clean water Eat foods that are best for your body, according to my Nutrition Plan Optimize your insulin and leptin levels Avoid excess sugar (especially fructose) and grain consumption Avoid processed foods, chemical additives, artificial sweeteners, MSG, and all genetically modified ingredients Consider taking a high-quality probiotic supplement, as your gastrointestinal system is an important part of your immune system Exercise three to five times a week Get plenty of restorative sleep every night claimsBM5 rises in defense of the establishment again, this time establishment medical care as opposed to alternative medical care.

(Yes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention included \"accidents\" and \"suicide,\" but they were not number one in any event, which makes their inclusion moot.)\n\nDr. Mercola and you superimpose an entirely different classification--another paradigm completely--when you designate errors in conventional medical methodology as a \"disease.\" By choosing to use that classification, you are obligated (assuming you want to prove your case and provide a basis for comparison) to list subclassifications, i.e.: a) physician errors, including wrong dosage, incorrect diagnosis, incorrect medication, etc.; b) hospital staff errors, including misreading a prescription by a pharmacist, failure of a nurse to record times medications were given and in what amounts, etc.; c) procedural errors by hospital administration or the hospital's medical director. The list goes on. If you seek to dramatize the serious shortcomings of conventional medicine, you should place them in a stand-alone classification, thereby--I repeat-- making it possible to ascertain if, in fact, they trump all other events in causing deaths in the practice of conventional medicine. Your failure to do that makes your claim ring hollow.\n\nLet's assume[\/b]My \"references\" are anecdotal, which you will readily dismiss (I used the verb \"suspect\"). Nevertheless, in my own stake, in the past decade, eight individuals who eschewed conventional treatment for cancer and went the holistic route, died within a matter of weeks--three of them in the same family (some people are slow learners). I had occasion to give a blessing to a man who delayed cancer treatment and thought he could be cured by drinking a variety of herbal concoctions. By the time of the blessing, I knew he had only weeks to live; and with his family looking on, the spirit constrained me to tell him that in as loving and supportive a way as possible. Had he received conventional treatment at Stage I or Stage II, his life would have been prolonged; he may even have been cured.\n\nAs for your denigration of psychiatric drugs, perhaps you would prefer to return to the days when people who were mentally ill were \"put away\" for the rest of their lives because they could not be treated on an outpatient basis. My aunt entered Utah State Hospital (at the east end of Provo's Center Street) at age 34, diagnosed with schizophrenia She spent her entire life there, in a padded cell, dying in her 50s. Psychiatric drugs have been a blessing to many of the mentally ill, untoward side effects notwithstanding. It's our family's tragedy that they weren't available for my aunt.\n\nIf you read the post, you will see that it is Dr Mercola (himself a medical doctor) who makes and substantiates the assertion regarding the dangers of conventional medical drugs and treatments, not me.And Dr Mercola provides references; by contrast:How do you KNOW that \"Had he received conventional treatment at Stage I or Stage II, his life would have been prolonged;\" How do you know thatIf you read the post, you will see that it is Dr Mercola (himself a medical doctor) who makes and substantiates the assertion regarding the dangers of conventional medical drugs and treatments, not me.\n\nOh? What did you mean then when you wrote in your Febl. 28 post: I subscribe to info [emphases added] from Dr. Mercola. . . . Let's start with his report on the biggest killer in the USA. . .not heart disease or cancer but rather. . .injury and death from doctor-prescribed drugs!\" Clearly, you endorsed his report.\n\n:You initiated the personal attack when you wrote, mockingly, \"BM5 rises in defense of the establishment again. . . .\" (May 28, 7:44 p.m.). My response to your endorsement of Dr. Mercola's claim was to take issue with its validity; it wasn't a personal attack on you.\n\n: And Dr Mercola provides references; by contrast. . . .: How do you KNOW that \"Had he received conventional treatment at Stage I or Stage II, his life would have been prolonged;\" How do you know that?\n\nHis oncologist told him so.\n\nHow is what you quoted a personal attack? DrJones was describing a behavior, and even more particularly a specific act, not describing a characteristic of your person... so how could it be a personal attack?ThisThat said, thank you for quoting it... I think it clarifies your position and how you approach this topic quite well for everyone who had been following this thread.\n\n: How is what you quoted a personal attack? DrJones was describing a behavior, and even more particularly a specific act, not describing a characteristic of your person... so how could it be a personal attack?\n\nBut he was describing \"a characteristic of [my] person\" by saying that I rise again in defense of the establishment.: ThisDr. Beaven does not say that \"alternatives to mainstream medicine\" are only trusted by \"minors and the credulous\" (you inserted the adverb to leverage your criticism). He says they are \"particularly vulnerable\"--not exclusively vulnerable. Furthermore, he says they are among \"those who may not understand methods. . . .\" Contrary to your groundless assertion, Dr. Beaven is not guilty of using false logic; he isn't arguing. He is simply stating the facts, discomforting though they may be.\n\nI find this to be an important question, worth some study. And I invite forum members to join in the study. It has to do also with taking our OWN responsibility for our health, and not putting our trust in the arm of pharmaceuticals\/doctor prescriptions or even hospitals.\n\nI find two articles by Dr Mercola that say yes to this question -- with references. It is the references that provide hard DATA responding to the question that interest me particularly, and any contrary references with DATA we can find.\n\n1st article:In an analysis, 24\/7 Wall St. determined that the costs to the economy for these top 10 causes, including not only direct medical care but also the indirect loss of productivity, amounts to a whopping $1.1 trillion!Over a decade ago, Professor Bruce Pomerance of the University of Toronto concluded that properly prescribed and correctly taken pharmaceutical drugs were the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. More recently, an article authored in two parts by Gary Null, PhD, Carolyn Dean, MD, ND, Martin Feldman, MD, Debora Rasio, MD, and Dorothy Smith, PhD, describes in excruciating detail how the modern conventional American\n\nIn 2010 (the same year from which the CDC data came), years after the original article was written, an analysis in the New England Journal of Medicineii piqued my interest \u2013 as In my update to the original Death by Medicine article, you can get an idea of just how deadly the conventional medical care system actually is:\n\n* In a June 2010 report in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, study authors said that in looking over recordsiii that spanned from 1976 to 2006 (the most recent year available) they found that, of 62 million death certificates, almost a quarter-million deaths were coded as having occurred in a hospital setting due to medication errors. * An estimated 450,000 preventable medication-related adverse events occur in the U.S. every year. * The costs of adverse drug reactionsiv to society are more than $136 billion annually -- greater than the total cost of cardiovascular or diabetic care. * Adverse drug reactions cause injuries or death in 1 of 5 hospital patients. * The reason there are so many adverse drug eventsv in the U.S. is because so many drugs are used and prescribed \u2013 and many patients receive multiple prescriptions at varying strengths, some of which may counteract each other or cause more severe reactions when combined.\n\nHow Many Deaths by Medicine are Disguised as Other Causes?\n\nAnother issue is just how many \"accidents\" or \"suicides\" are actually the result of accidental drug overdoses. Prescription drugs are now killing far more people than illegal drugs, and while most major causes of preventable deaths are declining, those from prescription drug use are increasing -- and this is according to the CDC's own datavi.\n\nIn 2009, there were nearly 4.6 million drug-related visitsvii to U.S. emergency rooms nationwide, with more than half due to adverse reactions to prescription medications \u2013 most of which were being taken exactly as prescribedviii.\n\nFurther, between 2001 and 2008, there was a 36 percent increase in hospital admissionsix, and a 28 percent increase in emergency room visits, among children 5 and younger who had accidentally ingested medication. ER visits for ingestion of prescription opioid painkillers, such as Oxycodone, increased 101 percent! So it is unclear how many deaths from accidental drug overdose are classified as accidents or suicides.\n\nThe 9th and 11th Top Killers Might Also be Linked to Medical Care\n\nThe 11th leading cause of death according to the CDC is septicemia (sometimes called blood poisoning), which is bacteria in your bloodstream that is often caused by an infection in your body -- an infection that is often acquired in the hospital! A study published in the Archives of Internal Medicinex showed that sepsis and pneumonia caused by hospital-acquired infections killed 48,000 patients and ramped up health care costs by over $8 billion in 2006. The study also found that 20 percent of people who developed sepsis died; 11 percent of those who developed pneumonia died.\n\nPneumonia is the 9th leading cause of death, and in some cases may again be related to the high risk of acquiring an infection should you enter the hospital.\n\nA different study in 2006 showed that \"central-line-associated\" bloodstream infectionsxi Despite their high death toll, hospital-acquired infections make no appearance in the CDC's report.\n\nMost of the Leading Causes of Death are Preventable\n\nMost chronic diseases, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, are largely preventable with simple lifestyle changes. Even infectious diseases like the flu can often be warded off by a healthy way of life.\n\nImagine. So what does a \"healthy lifestyle\" entail?\n\n* ProperFor the best nutrition and health benefits, you will want to eat a good portion of your food raw. Personally, I aim to eat about 80-85 percent of my food raw, including raw eggs and humanely raised organic animal products that have not been raised on a CAFO (confined animal feeding operation). High-intensity interval-type training boosts human growth hormone (HGH) production, which is essential for optimal health, strength and vigor. I've discussed the importance of Peak Fitness for your health on numerous occasions, so for more information, please review this previous article.\n\n* Stress Reduction and Positive Thinking\n\nYou cannot be optimally healthy if you avoid addressing the emotional component of your health and longevity, as your emotional state plays a social support and exercise are all viable options that can help you maintain emotional and mental equilibrium.\n\n* Proper Sun Exposure* High Quality Animal-Based Omega-3 Fats\n\nAnimal-based omega-3 fat like krill oil is a strong factor in helping people live longer, and many experts believe that it is likely the predominant reason why the Japanese are the longest lived race on the planet.\n\n* Avoid as Many Chemicals, Toxins, and Pollutants as Possible\n\nThis includes tossing out your toxic household cleaners, soaps, personal hygiene products, air fresheners, bug sprays, lawn pesticides, and insecticides, just to name a few, and replacing them with non-toxic alternatives.\n\nPrescription PillsIt's been seven years since I posted the comprehensive, footnoted research article, Death by Medicine, on this website.\n\nAuthored in two parts by Gary Null PhD, Carolyn Dean MD ND, Martin Feldman MD, Debora Rasio MD, and Dorothy Smith PhD, it described in excruciating detail how the modern American medical system had American medicine caused more harm than good.\n\nThe purpose of this was not to frighten you, but to help you make informed choices about your health, and to provide you with the tools you need to take control of your own health\n\nSeven years after the original article was written, an analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine November 25, 2010 piqued my interest --Shocked, I decided to do some research of my own on the state of American health care today.What I found is the grim picture that I'm sharing with you, as an update to the original Death by Medicine article.\n\nOver 40,000 Mistakes EVERY Day!\n\nUnfortunately, the NEJM article was just a reminder of something that the Thirteenth Annual HealthGrades Hospital Quality in America Study pointed out earlier this year.\n\nHealthGrades has been studying the quality of care in the nation's hospitals since 1988. This year they analyzed approximately 40 million Medicare patients' records from 2007 through 2009, and found that 1 in 9 patients developed a hospital-acquired infection.\n\nThe HealthGrades report said that \"the incidence rate of medical harm occurring is estimated to be over 40,000 each and EVERY day according to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement.\"\n\nAnother study, in 2008, by the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, also reported grave evidence that something is amiss in the hospital setting in America: One in seven Medicare beneficiaries who is hospitalized will be harmed as a result of the medical care they receive in the hospital, the study said.\n\nAuthors of this study found that physician reviewers determined nearly half, or 44 percent of the adverse and temporary harm events \"were clearly or likely preventable.\" The cost of these mistakes was estimated at $324 million in October alone. The mistakes equate to 3.5 percent of the Medicare budget.\n\nHospital-Acquired Infections\n\nAnother study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine this year, showed that sepsis and pneumonia caused by hospital-acquired infections killed 48,000 patients and ramped up health care costs by $8.1 billion in 2006 alone. Both these infections are mostly preventable through better infection controls. The study also found that 20 percent of people who developed sepsis died; 11 percent of those who developed pneumonia died.\n\nThe authors noted that many hospital-acquired infections are super resistant to common antibiotics \u2013 and it's not just sepsis and pneumonia that they're talking about.\n\nA different study in 2006 showed that \"central-line-associated\" bloodstream infections\n\nMedication Errors are a Major Killer\n\nIn 2000 the Institutes of Medicine reported that medical errors were the eighth leading cause of death in the U.S., killing between 44,000 and 98,000 people each year. While the number of errors today is said to possibly be the fourth leading cause of death in a hospital, health officials agree that this type of death-by-medicine is still prevalent -- and preventable They also found that these errors spiked in July, and particularly in teaching hospitals.\n\nThere are four points in the medication use process at which errors may occur:\n\n1. when the medication is ordered (written, electronic, or oral) 2. when the medication order is transcribed and verified 3. when it's dispensed, and 4. when it's administered\n\nOlder adults are at a higher risk of medication errors and have a greater propensity for experiencing harmful and fatal errors. The most common types of medication errors in older adults are omission and improper dose.\n\nNearly Half a Million Preventable Adverse Drug Reactions\n\nAn estimated 450,000 preventable medication-related adverse events occur in the U.S. every year.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Gerontology in 2006 showed that adverse drug reactions are very common in frail elderly persons after a hospital stay, and polypharmacy and warfarin use consistently increase the risk.\n\nThe costs of adverse drug reactions to society are more than $136 billion annually -- greater than the total cost of cardiovascular or diabetic care. AdIn 2009 there were nearly 3.68 billion prescriptions filled in the U.S. That averages to almost 12 prescriptions for every person in the U.S. Other interesting drug statistics are:\n\n* Specialists give more than 2 prescriptions per visit * Just over 89 percent of Medicare patients take prescription medicine daily * 46 percent take 5 or more prescriptions chronically * Nearly 54 percent take meds prescribed by more than one doctor\n\nOne thing that the drug companies don't tell you, and that your physician may not realize, is that premarketing drug safety profiles may be very narrow: most new drugs have 3,000 or less short-term patient exposures. Another fact the drug companies don't advertise is that some drugs have rare toxicity possibilities, meaning very bad side effects could occur in as few as 1 in 20,000 patients. To detect such rare toxicity, more than 60,000 patients must be exposed AFTER the drug is marketed.\n\n49th in Life Expectancy, First in Health Care Costs\n\nThe latest study published in Health Affairs revealed that the United States now ranks 49th in the world for both male and female life expectancy, down from 24th in 1999.\n\nIn 1950, the United States was fifth among the leading industrialized nations with respect to female life expectancy at birth, surpassed only by Sweden, Norway, Australia, and the Netherlands. The last available measure of female life expectancy had the United States ranked at forty-sixth in the world. U.S. infants also are in the basement when it comes to mortality rates; according to 2009 data compiled by the World Bank, the U.S. is 41 places behind other countries in infant mortality.\n\nIs American Medicine Working?\n\nThere's no doubt that government health care officials are worried about this country's reputation for safety in the hospital setting. If they weren't, they wouldn't have set up the Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety, a task force charged with developing plans and strategies for making American health care safer.\n\nThe problem is that, as it always with government, things move very slowly when change is needed, so the nation has yet to have a nation adverse event reporting system for hospital medical errors. We also don't have any federal standards regarding state systems. The question is whether living the status quo is going to make us any healthier or not, and if it doesn't, what are we going to do to make a better life for ourselves?\n\nWhat about Preventive Care?\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to figure out that the American health care system is skewed toward treating illnesses and diseases, not preventing them. In 2003, my Death by Medicine report showed that judging by health care spending alone, the U.S. should be the healthiest country in the world with the best medicine available. But it wasn't.\n\nAnd today, it still isn't.\n\nOne reason for that is because an obscure federal panel that most people never hear about not only defines what preventive medicine is, but decides what services your health care dollars will pay for. Historically that panel, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, has been accused of being ultra-conservative in the way of preventive care. But when it does approve it, the definition of preventive care means some kind of diagnostic test for a possible existing illness, not a strategy for staying well.\n\nFor example, if you take a look at the task force's website, you'll see lists of \"preventive\" medicine topics the group is considering that include such things as aspirin use and various types of disease screenings -- with only one mention of vitamin supplements as a possible upcoming preventive strategy.\n\nIf you click on the task force's A to Z topic guide of existing \"preventive\" health care, you'll see that almost every single one is some type of disease screening or counseling for a condition you already have.\n\nAnd that's what's wrong with U.S. health care, whether it was seven years ago or today -- we are all too eager to embrace screenings for diseases or illnesses we may or may not have, and counseling and\/or medical treatment in the form of pills and chemicals and surgeries for it, after we find out what disease it is we have.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Foundation and the CDC, the main drivers of health care costs in the U.S. are technology and prescription drugs; chronic disease; aging of the population; and administrative costs.\n\nI agree that these are huge contributors to what is killing us as a nation financially and as a people. But I DON'T agree with the context in which they're presented. If you've followed all the information I've given you here, and even skimmed the 2003 Death by Medicine article, then I think you'll see why I think the major contributors have a slightly different paradigm -- and that the only way we are get healthier as a nation, and drive medical costs down too, is to change that paradigm.\n\n1. The emphasis on sickness and treatment, rather than health, fitness, and prevention which is primarily fostered by ultra-sophisticated marketing strategies employed by the drug industry. 2. Fraud -- by both consumers and providers, including the drug industry. 3. Unnecessary procedures, medications, hospitalizations and screenings 4. Medical mistakes, hospital-acquired infections, and surgical and device errors\n\nIf we were only to address these issues, beginning with changing the emphasis of our well-being to health and fitness, and then following the healthy lifestyle that paradigm suggests, I promise that the issue of sickness in America and what it's costing us -- as well as the death-by-medicine events will begin to fade away very quickly.\n\nIt's time to quit bombarding your body with medical interventions and to reward yourself with the fit and healthy body that come from living fit and lean.\n\nAnd until then -- until our health care system as a whole -- changes the emphasis of what we're doing to health and healthful living, exercise, proper nutrition and diet, and vitamin supplementation, we're not going to see anything in our health care system change, even if we wait another seven years to see how it's going.\n\nDrJones wrote:The foregoing is strikingly different from what appears in your post of May 28, 7:44 p.m. (in red ink in large font): The CDC Left Conventional Medical Care Off of Their Death List--It Should be #1"}

Scientists at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre measured key air quality parameters in Mediterranean harbours before and after the entry into force of the low-sulphur requirements in January 2010. In European harbours they found an average decrease of 66% in concentrations of sulphur dioxide, a chemical compound that poses risks to health and the environment. Measurements taken in a non-EU port showed that levels of this noxious substance remained the same.\n\nThe air quality measurements were carried out using an automated monitoring station on the cruise ship Costa Pacifica which followed a fixed weekly route in the Western Mediterranean during 2009 and 2010. The concentrations of sulphur dioxide were found to decrease significantly in three out of the four Mediterranean EU harbours that were investigated: Civitavecchia, Savona and Palma de Mallorca; the daily mean concentrations in all of the harbours decreased on average by 66%. JRC measurements in the harbour of Barcelona were inconclusive because of large day-to-day concentration variations. However, independent measurements from monitoring stations in the harbour of Barcelona and in the vicinity of the harbour of Palma de Mallorca confirm a strong decrease in sulphur dioxide concentrations from 2009 to 2010.\n\nIn contrast, no decrease in sulphur dioxide was observed in the Mediterranean harbour of Tunis, and there was no reduction in any of the other air pollutants that were measured in all four harbours (Civitavecchia, Savona, Palma de Mallorca and Tunis). This shows that the decreases in sulphur dioxide are a direct consequence of the application of the EU requirements. The study also confirms a correlation between sulphur dioxide and chemical elements typically emitted from ship stacks which demonstrates that ships were the main source of sulphur dioxide in the harbours.\n\nThe logistics for the automated ship-borne monitoring station for air pollutants used in this work were provided by Costa Crociere and the measurements were performed in collaboration with scientists from the Universities of Genoa and Florence, the INFN- LABEC Laboratory in Florence as well as from the Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research in Barcelona.\n\nBackground\nSulphur dioxide is one of the main chemicals responsible for formation of acid rain and particulate air pollution \u2013 a major risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.\nThe 2005 amendment of Directive 1999\/32\/EC required that, as of January 2010, all ships at berth or at anchor in European harbours use fuels with a sulphur content of less than 0.1% by weight, while previously, outside of Sulphur Emission Control Areas, a sulphur content of up to 4.5% was allowed.\n\nShips traditionally use heavy fuel oil which, from 2012, can have a sulphur content of up to 3.5% for cargo vessels (before 2012 this limit was 4.5%). The average sulphur content of heavy fuel oil is about 2.4%. By comparison, the sulphur content of fuels used in road vehicles must not exceed 0.001%.\n\nIn line with the broader environmental protection objectives of the EU and strengthening a parallel agreement reached by the International Maritime Organisation, the European Parliament and the Council have come to an agreement to be submitted to formal vote after the summer on an amendment to the 1999\/32\/EC directive to further reduce sulphur content of fuels used outside of harbours. The maximum allowed sulphur content of ship fuels will go down from 3.5% to 0.5% in 2020, and in the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel) the current limit of 1,5% sulphur content for ship fuels will be reduced to 0.1% in 2015.\n\nThe results of the study, entitled 'Impact of a European directive on ship emissions on air quality in Mediterranean harbours', have been published in the scientific journal Atmospheric Environment1."}

{"text":"Leading Atmospheric Scientist To Head UH's Air Quality, Climate Research\n\nBy Rolando Garcia\nNatural Sciences and Mathematics\n\nOne of the nation's most prominent atmospheric scientists is now spearheading the University of Houston's burgeoning research efforts in air quality and climate change.\n\nIn January Robert Talbot, professor of atmospheric science, became the new director of UH's Institute for Multidimensional Air Quality Studies, which models, forecasts and continuously monitors Houston's air quality.\n\nDuring more than two decades at the University of New Hampshire, Talbot built an air pollution research group that was among the largest and most sophisticated of its kind, attracting more than $10 million annually in federal funding. Most recently, he helped set up a ground-breaking air monitoring station in China that could yield the most advanced studies to-date of air pollution in Chinese cities.\n\nWith Houston perennially ranked second (behind Los Angeles) among U.S. cities with the most polluted air, air quality studies in the region pose special challenges and opportunities, Talbot said, and it is crucial that UH establish a strong presence in atmospheric science.\n\n\"Robert Talbot is not only one of the most respected atmospheric scientists in the field, he has a proven record of building strong research programs,\" said John Casey, chair of the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. \"Professor Talbot has the expertise and experience to make UH a leader in air quality and climate change studies.\"\n\nThe effort has already come a long way since the department hired its first atmospheric scientist in 2000. Measurement instruments atop Moody Tower, an 18-story dormitory on the UH campus, coupled with four measurement stations throughout the county and data collected from an aircraft and balloon sampling are helping scientists develop a more accurate profile of the region's atmosphere.\n\nThese gauges measure fluctuating levels of more than 80 compounds that contribute to air pollution. These studies have provided the first reliable measurements of mercury in Houston's air, and have also pinpointed the region's refineries and petrochemical plants as the source of much of the formaldehyde in the region's air. Formaldehyde serves as a catalyst in the production of ozone \u2013 a harmful pollutant when present in ground-level air.\n\nIMAQS also generates daily ozone forecasts to aid Houston residents with breathing disabilities plan their outside activities. These forecasts run every evening on high performance computers and the results are posted daily at the institute's Web site.\n\nIn addition to the air quality studies, the department now offers master's and doctorate degrees in atmospheric science. And undergraduates majoring in environmental science \u2013 a bachelor's degree offered by the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics \u2013 can choose an atmospheric science track.\nThree years ago, the department even changed its name from the Department of Geoscience to reflect this new, broader mission as it expands beyond its traditional strengths in geology and geophysics.\n\nThere are currently four atmospheric scientists on faculty and Talbot hopes to add another two in the near future. His goal is to build the kind of large, regional program he established at New Hampshire, where his studies of New England's air quality were among the most advanced and comprehensive ever undertaken. Integrating satellite data and air measurements collected at several stations, Talbot's team studied how New England was affected by air pollution generated in the Ohio River valley that drifted northeast before moving out into the Atlantic.\n\nThis phenomenon made New England the \"tailpipe of the U.S.\" Talbot said. Air pollution moves globally, Talbot added, with pollution from Asia likely affecting air quality on the West Coast, for example. However, despite the rapid industrialization of China and the almost choking air pollution in its major cities, reliable air quality data is scarce, Talbot said.\n\nSo in January, he teamed up with scientists at Nanjing University to establish a state-of-the-art air monitoring station atop a 25-story dormitory on the Nanjing campus. Nanjing is a major industrial city of more than 7 million residents and the air is filled with a thick, almost permanent haze of air pollution, Talbot said. On a typical day visibility is perhaps half a kilometer. Over the next two years the monitoring station in Nanjing will measure the presence of several pollutants in the city's air, including mercury and black carbon."}

Hendricks spoke to KCTV5 Investigative Reporter Stacey Cameron via satellite.\n\n\"How important is this for schools and states to look at their laws and regulations and potentially require them?\" Cameron asked.\n\n\"Well, you know it's an issue,\" Hendrick responded. \"There are just two states that have passed any law that would mandate carbon monoxide detectors in schools.\"\n\n\"Is either Missouri or Kansas on that list?\" Cameron followed up.\n\n\"No, no,\" Hendrick said.\n\nThe lack of such a requirement is something fire chiefs like Ray Adams of the South Metropolitan Fire Protection District find difficult to understand. Adams places the need for CO detectors on par with smoke alarms and sprinkler systems.\n\n\"The nature of carbon monoxide - it's tasteless, it's odorless. You can't see it. You never know it's there until you start suffering symptoms from it or somebody monitors it,\" Adams said. \"The only way you can detect the presence of carbon monoxide is through a detector.\"\n\nAdams knows firsthand what can happen when a school operates without the rather simple device. Just last month, students and teachers at Timberlake Elementary in the Ray-Pec School District started complaining of headaches and nausea.\n\n\"The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning kind of mimic a lot of other things like flu, cold, things of that nature,\" Adams said.\n\nIn the middle of flu season, inside a school without detectors, no one thought to blame the illnesses on CO poisoning.\n\nLuckily, a fire marshal happened to stop in for a regular inspection and detected the leak.\n\n\"That just happened to be the draw that day,\" Adams said.\n\nAt one point, the fire marshal was getting readings of 65 parts per million, which is significantly high. That discovery led Adams to evacuate the school and possibly divert a disaster.\n\nThis leaves many asking why CO detectors aren't required in every school if they are so critical. Hendricks suggests money may be one reason.\n\n\"It's a tough time in terms of budgets for both states and schools,\" Hendrick said.\n\nBut cost didn't deter school leaders in Olathe, KS.\n\nThe school district's chief financial and operations officer, John Hutchison, said CO detectors were installed in Olathe schools 21 years ago.\n\n\"The district saw it as a growing safety concern,\" Hutchison said. \"It's not that big of an investment. The devices are about $40 to $50 apiece.\"\n\nAnother reason why states like Kansas and Missouri don't require CO detectors is that most legislators have no idea the devices aren't already installed. Among them is Missouri State Rep. Rick Brattin. The Harrisonville, MO, Republican represents District 55, which just happens to include the Ray-Pec elementary school, which was evacuated in January.\n\n\"It actually is pretty shocking,\" Brattin said. \"To be honest, I just assumed they were already there.\"\n\nBarbara Bollier, a Republican who represents Kansas' House District 25, was also taken aback by the lack of requirements for CO detectors.\n\n\"I think this is certainly worth investigating,\" Bollier said.\n\nAfter being alerted to the problem by KCTV5, both lawmakers said they'll work on their side of the state line to make CO detectors standard in all schools.\n\n\"Raising awareness of an issue gets everyone thinking and deciding, 'how can we best fix this problem, and quickly fix this?'\" Bollier said.\n\n\"Something that's an easy fix; not having to go through a six-month process of legislation,\" Brattin said. \"Just have it done now and not worry about all the red tape.\"\n\nWhat Brattin and Bollier suggest is not a new law, but a rule or regulation put into place by each state's department of education. Something like that could get CO detectors in schools almost immediately.\n\nThe two states that do require CO detectors are Maryland and Connecticut. KCTV5 did find some schools in the Kansas City area using CO detectors, either because a city or county ordinance requires it or, like Olathe, the district made the decision on its own. into"}
{"text":"Abstract. The Chinese Spring Festival is one of the most important traditional\nfestivals in China. The peak transport in the Spring Festival season (spring\ntravel rush) provides a unique opportunity for investigating the impact of\nhuman activity on air quality in the Chinese megacities. Emission sources\nare varied and fluctuate greatly before, during and after the Festival.\nIncreased vehicular emissions during the \"spring travel rush\" before the\n2009 Festival resulted in high level pollutants of NOx\n(270 \u03bcg m\u22123), CO (2572 \u03bcg m\u22123),\nblack carbon (BC) (8.5 \u03bcg m\u22123) and\nextremely low single scattering albedo of 0.76 in Shanghai, indicating\nstrong, fresh combustion. Organics contributed most to PM2.5, followed\nby NO3\u2212, NH4+, and SO42\u2212. During the Chinese\nLunar New Year's Eve and Day, widespread usage of fireworks caused heavy\npollution of extremely high aerosol concentration, scattering coefficient,\nSO2, and NOx. Due to the \"spring travel rush\" after the festival,\nanthropogenic emissions gradually climbed and mirrored corresponding\nincreases in the aerosol components and gaseous pollutants. Secondary\ninorganic aerosol (SO42\u2212, NO3\u2212, and NH4+)\naccounted for a dominant fraction of 74% in PM2.5 due to an increase\nin human activity. There was a greater demand for energy as vast numbers of\npeople using public transportation or driving their own vehicles returned\nhome after the Festival. Factories and constructions sites were operating\nagain.\n\nThe potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis illustrated the\npossible source areas for air pollutants of Shanghai. The effects of\nregional and long-range transport were both revealed. Five major sources,\ni.e. natural sources, vehicular emissions, burning of fireworks, industrial\nand metallurgical emissions, and coal burning were identified using the\nprinciple component analysis. The average visibility during the whole study\nperiod was less than 6 km. It had been estimated that 50% of the total\nlight extinction was due to the high water vapor in the atmosphere. This\nstudy demonstrates that organic aerosol was the largest contributor to\naerosol extinction at 47%, followed by sulfate ammonium, nitrate\nammonium, and EC at 22%, 14%, and 12%, respectively. Our results\nindicated the dominant role of traffic-related aerosol species (i.e. organic\naerosol, nitrate and EC) on the formation of air pollution, and suggested\nthe importance of controlling vehicle numbers and emissions in mega-cities\nof China as its population and economy continue to grow."}
{"text":"Significant Air Pollution Dates\n\nSmog Alerts\n\nSmog is a problem in most large cities. It is caused by emissions from industry, motor vehicles, domestic wood combustion and other sources, accumulating under certain weather conditions.\n\nEPA Victoria has developed a smog alert system to forecast smog days. EPA's assessment depends on the amount of pollution in the air and on the prevailing weather conditions. For example windy blustery conditions will disperse pollution, whereas still days allows pollution to\nconcentrate. When a smog day is forecast, EPA releases these messages to the media. Note that the messages are slightly different for winter or summer smog alerts.\n\nSummer smog alert;\n\nWeather conditions are likely to result in the production of ozone, the principal constituent of summer smog.\n\nPeople are encouraged to avoid unnecessary use of their cars as motor vehicle exhaust gases are the major contributor to photo-chemical smog.\n\nIndustries whose licences require special action on smog alert days are instructed to comply with the conditions set out on their licence.\n\nAll open burning should be avoided. Under local laws, open burning or the use of backyard incinerators is banned in most metropolitan municipalities.\n\nPeople with respiratory, allergic or cardiac conditions are advised to take their medication and minimise strenuous activity.\n\nAutumn\/winter smog alert;\n\nWeather conditions should favour the build up of airborne particles resulting in reduced visibility in and around Melbourne.\n\nOutdoor fires should not be lit while a smog alert is in place as smoke and ash from burning increases pollution levels.\n\nPeople should consult their local council or shire to check the local laws on open burning on smog alert days.\n\nIf alternatives are available, avoid using solid fuel domestic heaters.\n\nPeople are asked to avoid unnecessary use of their cars as motor vehicle exhausts are significant contributors to reduced visibility.\n\nIndustries with licences requiring special action on smog days are instructed to comply with the conditions set out in the licence.\n\nPeople with respiratory, allergic or cardiac conditions are advised to take their medication and minimise strenuous activity.\n\nSmog alerts are issued to the media on the day before a potential episode. The media usually include smog alerts in their weather segment and on the front page of daily newspapers.\n\nEPA also has a smog alert warning on this web site.

{"text":"EPA to cut air pollution from natural gas 'fracking'\n\nApr 19, 2012 By Amanda Gardner, HealthDay Reporter\n\nFirst-ever standards for controversial industry should cut smog, but environmentalists say more can be done.\n\n(HealthDay) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday issued the first national standards to curb air pollution linked with the controversial practice of \"fracking.\"\n\nFracking refers to hydraulic fracturing, a way to obtain natural gas by forcing fluid into a well to fracture rocks and thus release gas.\n\nNatural gas is being touted by the Obama Administration as a clean energy source and one that does not rely on foreign suppliers.\n\nThe standards, to take full effect at the beginning of 2015, \"will reduce smog-forming air pollution along with cancer-causing air toxins,\" contends Gina McCarthy, an assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nSmog also emits toxins such as benzene that can cause cancer, said McCarthy, who spoke at a Wednesday news conference.\n\nMcCarthy estimated that the rule will cut volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which contribute to smog by 190,000 to 290,000 tons a year, and benzene by 12,000 to 15,000 tons a year.\n\nAlthough the rule does not directly target greenhouse gases, methane levels will also be reduced as a byproduct of technologies required to meet the tougher standard, she said.\n\nEnvironmentalists have been concerned about natural gas that escapes these wells, filtering up into the air and potentially harming human health.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday, Meleah Geertsma, of the environmental watchdog group National Resources Defense Council, called the EPA move \"a critical step toward protecting our kids, our communities and our planet.\" But Geertsma, an attorney for NRDC's climate and clean air program, also said that the initiative does not go far enough. \"The EPA needs to do more to protect people living near oil and gas production facilities,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, last year in western Wyoming fracking resulted in ground-level ozone, the main constituent in smog, at levels that were worse than that seen in smog-ridden Los Angeles.\n\nBenzene levels considered dangerous to human health have been detected in Dish, Texas, which is near numerous fracking sites, the AP also reported.\n\nOn the other hand, drilling sites in four counties in Pennsylvania have not been associated with air emissions problems, the AP said.\n\nOperators of new \"fracked\" natural gas wells will have to capture any additional natural gas using technologies that are already available, according to the EPA rules.\n\nThey then will be able to sell that extra gas, making the new regulations ultimately cost-effective and even cost-saving, McCarthy said.\n\nBetween now and Jan. 1, 2015, natural gas operators must either \"flare\" (burn) gas emissions or use \"green completions\" technologies to prevent gas from escaping. Starting in 2015, however, companies will have to use green completions.\n\n\"Completion\" refers to a process taking place over three to 10 days, as a well transitions from being drilled to actually producing natural gas. Much of the pollution from fracking is thought to be emitted during this period.\n\nThe EPA estimates that about 13,000 wells are fractured or re-fractured each year in the United States. Some states, such as Colorado and Wyoming, already regulate the fracking industry, the AP noted.\n\n\"This is the first national standard to reduce air pollution from hydraulically fractured wells,\" McCarthy said. \"When implemented, it will require operators to capture gas that would otherwise escape into the air, keeping harmful pollution out of the air.\"\n\nBut the NRDC believes more must be done. In their statement, the group said it is \"disappointed that EPA has allowed industry more than two and a half years for full compliance. It should not take that long to build more of the truck-mounted rigs that can capture these gases and put them into the pipelines to be sold at a profit instead of leaked into our air.\"\n\nThe NRDC believes the EPA \"also needs to set strong standards that directly curb leakage of methane and other dangerous pollutants from the existing wells and operations.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(AP) -- Faced with a natural gas drilling boom that has sullied the air in some parts of the country, the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday proposed for the first time to control air pollution at oil and gas wells, ...\n\nIn a new study, researchers from the Colorado School of Public Health have shown that air pollution caused by hydraulic fracturing or fracking may contribute to acute and chronic health problems for those living near natural ...\n\n(AP) -- Hundreds of people are attending a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency hearing in southwestern Pennsylvania on a controversial natural gas drilling technique called hydraulic fracturing, or \"fracking.\"\n\nThe first comprehensive analysis of air emissions associated with natural gas and oil production in the Barnett Shale area finds that emissions can be a significant contributor to Dallas-Fort Worth smog formation, comparable ...\n\n(AP) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday for the first time that fracking - a controversial method of improving the productivity of oil and gas wells - may be to blame for causingresistant tuberculosis (TB) bacteria in laboratory culture.

{"text":"VOC compliance\n\nSolvents fulfill their main task when the paint is applied. They regulate the required viscosity of the material and affect the build up as well as the surface quality of the freshly applied coat. Once the process of application has been completed the solvents have done their job and should evaporate as quickly as possible.\n\nHowever, the fact that they escape into the air means the solvents contribute to air pollution. Especially in summer, when high pressure predominates to give fine weather, they promote the formation of ozone close to the ground.\n\nNow, ozone is a natural component of the atmosphere and protects the Earth from over-intensive irradiation by the sun. However, closer to ground level, too high a concentration of ozone can have damaging consequences as far as living things are concerned.\n\nIf humans breathe in too much ozone it can lead to chest pains, coughing and asthma attacks. The proportion of organic solvents that escape into the air during the manufacture and application of paint is currently around 32% of all VOC emissions. This level of output is now set to undergo a drastic reduction.\n\nVOC Definition\n\nIn the European VOC Guideline, volatile organic solvents are defined as organic compounds which, at 20 \u00b0C, have a vapour pressure of 0.01 kPa or, under their respective conditions of use, demonstrate corresponding volatility.\n\nWith respect to automotive refinish paints the following statement applies: all organic solvents in automotive repair paints count as VOCs.

{"text":"Air Pollution Linked to Increased Risk of Heart Attack and Stroke\n\nWe're used to thinking about air pollution as a trigger for asthma, but for heart attack and stroke? A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals that short-term exposure (for up to seven days) to most major air pollutants (such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter) appears to increase the immediate risk of suffering a heart attack. The researchers pooled the findings of 34 studies, and analyzed the results\u2014which, for the first time, reveal the link between short-term exposure and immediate heart attack risk. While the risk posed by air pollution is not as powerful as the other known classic risk factors for heart disease\u2014like high cholesterol and high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking and lack of physical exercise\u2014it's concerning given the number of Americans who live in polluted urban centers. The researchers speculate air pollution may cause harm through any number of mechanisms, including stimulating inflammation, increasing the heart rate, thickening the blood (making it more likely to clot), and accelerating the hardening of arteries, known as atherosclerosis. Another study this week, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, revealed that the risk of stroke was 34 percent higher in Boston when pollution levels rose from \"good\" to \"moderate\".\n\nThese studies add further confirmation to what's been suspected for decades, that there is a direct a link between high pollution levels and cardiovascular disease. And, the bad news is, the effects are seen rather immediately and at levels considered safe across many US cities. While the increase in risk may be small for any given individual, the overall toll that air pollution takes on all of us is huge, given that heart attack is the #1 killer and stroke the #3 killer in the US.\n\nWhat are we to do? Clearly, we need to work for cleaner air regulations and stricter pollution standards\u2014but that will take time. For those who already have heart disease, or are at high risk, and live in smog centers, it may be wise to start paying attention to daily air pollution alerts. Or, consider getting out of Dodge."}

{"text":"PureAire's O2 Monitor used in High Altitude Training Gains Recognition among Athletes\n\nSince 2006 PureAire Monitoring Systems O2 Monitors have been used in Hypoxic High Altitude Training rooms. The training rooms are designed to lower the breathable oxygen using nitrogen, and the oxygen monitor is needed to maintain the environment. The technology used to lower the O2 level is used with a nitrogen generator. By lowering the breathable oxygen this creates a more strenuous workout for an athlete.\n\nThe generator is important as it dispenses on demand nitrogen at any given time lowering the oxygen levels. For typical training, the oxygen levels are near 15% with the balance of nitrogen. At 15% oxygen the altitude system tricks the body to believe it is training around 8,000 ft above sea level. The O2 deficiency monitor operation range is 0-25%. PureAire's O2 deficiency monitor was defined as the best product to maintain these stable oxygen levels. Hypoxico Altitude Training Systems is the first to start selling and marketing a product like this.\n\nPureAire's oxygen deficiency monitor uses a zirconium oxide sensor. The monitor does not require maintenance or calibration. For these reasons, PureAire has been specified as the best fit for the altitude systems. The sensors life expectancy is 10+ years. In addition, the sensors are completely linear full scale of 0-25% giving an almost analyzer quality for the athletes.\n\nSome clients which have been reported to use these altitude training systems are Prince Harry, Lance Armstrong, David Beckham, Cleveland Indians, Bear Grylls, and Michael Phelps. On 60 minutes Michael Phelps talks about using an altitude tent, but said he did not want to show this room to cameras. Many other athletes use altitude training as part of their exercise routines as well.\n\nAltitude is characterized by the reduced partial pressure of oxygen. At a lower partial pressure, there is less oxygen in the air you breathe. It is this reduced oxygen content that stimulates the body to adapt and become more efficient in the uptake, transportation, and metabolism of oxygen. The HYPOXIC ALTITUDE TENT utilizes the same oxygen reduced air that one would find at high elevations. Our Hypoxic Generator continually separates out a portion of oxygen from ambient air before it is pumped into the enclosure. All other gases remain in the air, maintaining the atmospheric pressures of sea-level (or whatever altitude you are living at)1\n\nThe main O2 Monitor function which controls the desired training elevation, in the altitude room, is called hysteresis.\n\nHysteresis is similar to how an air conditioner keeps a desired temperature range in one's home. For example, if 70f degrees are set on a home's air conditioner, when the temperature begins to rise to 71f, the temperature control (hysteresis) turns on the air conditioning lowering the temp back down to 70f.\n\nThe PureAire O2 monitor has the same function. If the altitude room requires 15% oxygen, PureAire's O2 monitors hysteresis will work similar to the air conditioner in a home. When the O2 levels rise to 15.5%, the O2 monitor will control the nitrogen generator lowering the O2 to the desired range of 15%.\n\nPureAire is the only O2 monitor being used for altitude training systems currently and with the growing amount of athletes training, PureAire believes only the demand for these training systems will go up in the future."}

If you drive within the Congestion Charging zone during these times you will have to pay the Congestion Charge, even if you meet the LEZ emissions standards or have paid the LEZ daily charge.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThere are no barriers or tollbooths within the Low Emission Zone (LEZ). Instead, cameras will read your number plate as you drive within the LEZ and check it against our database of registered vehicles.\n\nThis database is compiled using information from The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), the Vehicle Operator Services Agency (VOSA), the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and drivers and operators who have registered directly with us.\n\nThis tells us automatically whether your vehicle meets the LEZ emissions standards, is exempt, is registered for a discount or if you've already paid the daily charge.\n\nWhich Vehicles are Effected?\n\nLorries, buses & coaches and heavy specialist vehicles\n\nIf you want to drive a lorry, bus, coach or other specialist heavy diesel vehicle in the Low Emission Zone (LEZ) without paying a daily charge, it needs to meet certain emissions standards.\n\nAt the moment, these vehicle types need to meet the Euro III standard for particulate matter (PM).\n\nHowever, from 3 January 2012, these standards are changing to Euro IV for PM, so even if your vehicle meets the current standards, you may need to take action soon to meet the new standards in time.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether your vehicle is used for commercial or private purposes - it will still need to meet the standards.\n\nThe age and weight of a vehicle indicate the level of particulate matter (PM) it produces.\n\nThe table below shows those diesel vehicles which don't meet the current LEZ emissions standards, and which will not meet the standards from 3 January 2012. If you own any of the vehicles listed, you will need to take action before driving within the LEZ, or pay a daily charge.\n\nThe LEZ emissions standards are based on Euro standards for the emission of particulate matter (PM). PM is very fine particles of soot emitted by vehicles, which have an effect on health. This type of pollution can contribute to asthma, heart and lung disease, other respiratory illnesses and even early death.\n\nThe standards now (2011)\n\nAt the moment, vehicles need to meet the Euro III standard for PM. Vehicles registered as new on or after 1 October 2001 are assumed to meet this standard.\n\nThe new standards from 3 January 2012\n\nFrom 3 January 2012, vehicles need to meet the Euro IV standard for PM. Vehicles registered as new on or after 1 October 2006 are assumed to meet these standards.\n\nHow do I know if my vehicle meets the standards?\n\nThe quickest way to check if your vehicle meets the current or new standards is to enter your registration plate details into our vehicle checker"}
{"text":"Using trees as a pollution barometer\n\nby Alan Harten May 27, 2009\n\nIf you want to know how much pollution is in the air, then look up towards the nearest tree.\n\nUK researchers from the University of Lancaster say that you can measure microscopic particles of pollution on urban trees, making the leaves of neighbourhood trees an accurate measure of pollution in the area.\n\nThe pollution found on the leaves is left from car engines or factories that burn fossil fuel. This produces compounds which form fine dust that is toxic when inhaled.\n\nThese particles can be manifested on the leaves at the same level that a normal human would breathe in the same area.\n\nThe Lancaster research team was headed by Professor Barbara Maher and studied a line of 30 trees.\n\nThey showed that within seven to ten days an accurate measure can be taken of air pollution in an area.\n\nMaher stated that while they plan to continue to study more trees to make their findings conclusive, the current results mean that every tree can be used as a pollution monitor.\n\nOne critical aim of the study is to provide more detailed results about air pollution location, as readings can differ in just a few city blocks if there is a busy intersection or a major pollutant in the direct area.\n\nThe particle air pollution can cause asthma, birth defects, developmental problems, strokes, and heart attacks if they are heavily concentrated for a long period of time in an area.\n\nMaher's study concluded that particle pollution is highest between from 0-.3 metres and 1.5-2 metres which could alter the way air pollution is addressed in the future."}

{"text":"KEN THOMAS\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Environmental Protection Agency\nfinalized rules Friday aimed at reducing toxic air pollution from\nindustrial boilers and incinerators while offering industry more\nflexibility and lower costs to comply with the new standards.\n\nObama\nadministration officials said most of the 1.5 million boilers\nnationwide are not covered by the regulation since they are too small or\nemit too little pollution to warrant controls.\n\nThe changes will\nrequire pollution controls at about 2,300 of the largest and most\npolluting boilers nationwide, including those found at refineries and\nchemical plants. Those boilers will have three years to comply and could\nbe\nhave opposed the environmental regulations as detrimental to business\nduring tough economic times and unsuccessfully tried to slow down the\nnew rules in Congress.\n\nThe EPA estimated that despite the\nflexibility and the decision to target the largest polluters, the rules\nwill still provide significant health benefits. The new standards will\nprevent up to 8,100 premature deaths, 5,100 heart attacks and 52,000\nasthma attacks, according to the agency.\n\nEPA estimated that\nAmericans would receive $13 to $29 in health benefits for every dollar\nspent to meet the final standards and lead to a small net increase in\njobs.\n\nEnvironmental groups said the rules were not as stringent as\nthey had hoped but would help Americans breathe cleaner air. \"These\nstandards are a mixed bag,\" said John Walke, director of the Natural\nResources Defense Council's Clean Air Program.\n\nIndustry groups\nsaid the regulations were still overly burdensome.

{"text":"Going green is really an ideal that's here to stay. More and more people are beginning to focus on putting forth the effort to give back to the environment around them and support its health as best they can.\n\nBut what does our environment give back to us, polluted air that's difficult to breathe in? Not only is the air quality poor outside, thanks in large part to those people who haven't been doing their part to keep the air clean as you have been doing, but think about the quality of the air in your home.\n\nStudies show that most Americans spend nearly 90% of their lives indoors. While you're there, do you want to be breathing in air that's just as dirty outside? Of course not! It's your home, it's your air quality, it's your lungs. Here are some ideas that kill two birds with one stone: work toward a greener lifestyle and improve your indoor air quality.\n\nControl Asbestos in Your Home\n\nAsbestos is a tiny particle that floats through the air, too small to be seen by the human eye or even by a standard microscope, that is toxic to humans. It's found in so many household products, though, such as some flooring, insulation, piping and old paint products, that a small amount of inhaled asbestos poses no real health concerns.\n\nHowever, any larger amounts of asbestos inhalation have been proven to lead to cases of lung cancer and other lung diseases, so it's a good idea to keep asbestos levels in your home controlled or eliminate them entirely.\n\nSince asbestos is such a small mineral fiber, it goes airborne effortlessly, and although it is a naturally occurring mineral in the earth, it tends to sit on top of the soil when it hits the ground so it's shifted around easily.\n\nThis means that it's easy for asbestos to contaminate the air, water and soil that surround us. So do your family and your neighbors' a favor and reduce the amount of asbestos in your home as best you can, as the Environmental Protection Agency has stated that a lifetime of exposure to small amounts of inhaled asbestos can pose a serious and potentially deadly health threat.\n\nUse Homemade Cleaning Products\n\nA simple solution of white vinegar and water shaken and sprayed onto a messy surface will do the trick for getting it clean. Popular cleaning solutions contain tons of potentially harmful chemicals to both the environment and your family and pets.\n\nCleaners and detergents that contain harmful chemicals can pose a threat of causing irritation to the skin, eyes, throat and lungs in people and pets, and can be harmful to the environment, as well.\n\nThink about where cleaning products go when you rinse them away \u2013 down the drain. They are processed with other sewage and dumped. Most cleaners will break down into substances that are no longer harmful, although many detergents that claim to have the \"best\" cleaning power contain a chemical that could infect the water supply and harm the animal habitat where the sewage is dumped.\n\nBy using your own homemade cleaning products, you can keep these chemicals from contaminating the air in your home as well as the environment around you. Plus, they're cheaper to make than they are to buy pre-made! And you're saving yourself from using an unnecessary plastic bottle, too.\n\nStop Using Aerosols\n\nProducts such as air freshener, deodorant spray, furniture polish, hair spray and carpet cleaner all contain artificial fragrances that often contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are considered toxic or hazardous. And all the product label has to state is that the product contains \"fragrances,\" so you'll never know when there is actually a deadly chemical hidden in there.\n\nThe use of aerosols has long been believed to harm the environment, as well, and it does. Most fragranced products are derived from petroleum products which are unrenewable, polluting resources. Releasing them into the air causes an irreversible negative effect on the environment.\n\nSo what can you do? Stop using aerosol products. Opt, again, for homemade products to replace them using all-natural ingredients, or choose fragrance-free products.\n\nLet the Outdoors In\n\nOpen a window in your house! Letting in some fresh air will not only combat the potentially deadly pollutants that have been emitted into the air in your home unknowingly, but it can be a natural way to cool your home during warmer months, too.\n\nDepending on where you live (cities and highly populated areas tend to have poorer air quality than the suburbs and open country spaces), the air quality outside may actually be better than that inside your home. The fresh air can help clear out the polluted air that you're breathing indoors.\n\nAnd if it tends to heat up quickly in your home, instead of turning on the air conditioning immediately when it warms up outside, try opening the windows for a natural breeze to flow throughout your home to cool it off. You'll save tons of energy this way and it's really an effective cooling technique assuming you get a good air flow.\n\nDecorate With Plants\n\nJust as plants outside filter the air that we breathe, indoor plants can help improve the air quality within your home, as well.\n\nDecorate using strategically placed house plants throughout your home. They have capabilities of filtering out any pollutants that may be in the air in your home and return to you clean, breathable air.\n\nHouse plants are also said to have an effect on mood and the general feeling of overall well-being. The bottom line: plants are good for you and good for the environment on all levels, so adding them to your home will only help improve your life and the air that you breathe!"}
{"text":"4-1.Background\n\nToxic air pollutants can be emitted from two motor vehicle systems by two emission producing processes: combustion products from the exhaust system and evaporation from the fuel storage and delivery system. Figure 4-1 shows these different emissions.\n\nExhaust emissions vary significantly with vehicle operating mode. There are three operating modes: cold start, hot start, and hot stabilized. The start modes refer to the first few minutes of operation after a engine has been started. A cold start and a hot start are differentiated by the duration between shutting off and restarting the engine. The hot stabilized mode includes all operation time except for the start mode period. The fuel-air mixture and the emission control equipment are two primary factors which cause the differences in emission amounts among operating modes. During cold start mode, the catalytic emission control systems do not provide full control until the appropriate operating temperature is reached. Moreover, a richer fuel-air mixture must be provided to start a \"cold\" engine. Therefore, VOC and PM emissions are higher in the cold start mode than in the hot start mode and reach the lowest amounts in the hot stabilized mode.\n\nEvaporative emissions are composed primarily of volatile organic compounds and these emissions are highly dependent on temperature. The following are the six categories of evaporative emissions:\n\nHot soak emissions:\n\nEmissions from the carburetor or fuel injector when the engine is turned off.\n\nDiurnal emissions:\n\nEmissions from the \"breathing\" of the gasoline tank due to temperature fluctuations during a 24-hour day.\n\nRunning losses:\n\nEmissions occurring while the vehicle is being operated. These emissions result when more fuel enters into the emission control canister than can be purged by it.\n\nResting losses:\n\nEmissions that result from vapor permeating the evaporative emission control system or from the vehicle fuel tanks.\n\nRefueling losses:\n\nEmissions occurring while a vehicle is being refueled. There are two components: vapor space displacement and spillage. These emissions have been estimated for the area source - gasoline service stations; they are not included in the mobile source emissions.\n\nCrankcase emissions:\n\nEmissions that result from defective crankcase ventilation valves. They are not true evaporative emissions.\n\nBased on the information presented above, there are three potential approaches for deriving toxic emissions for highway vehicles:\n\nuse toxic emission factors based on activity level;\n\nuse toxic emission factors based on fuel usage; or\n\ncombine total organic gases (TOG) and PM emissions with speciation profiles for each source category.\n\nThese emission estimation approaches are discussed in the following sections.\n\n4-2.Toxic Emission Factors Based on Activity Level\n\nBuilding a toxic emission inventory can be accomplished through the use of toxic emission factors combined with activity levels, such as miles traveled for a specific vehicle type with a specific control device, using a specific fuel and operating on a specific type of road. This is the same method used in toxic emission estimations for area and point sources. The EPA Factor Information Retrieval System (FIRE) Version 5.1a (1996) has compiled 61 such emission factors for highway vehicles. However, all these emission factors were compiled only for light duty gasoline vehicles and only for 10 pollutants. It may take years to develop the emission factors for all vehicle types and for all pollutants of concern.\n\n4-3.Toxic Emission Factors Based on Fuel Usage\n\nA second potential approach for deriving toxic emissions from mobile sources is to use toxic emission factors based on fuel usage. Establishing a motor vehicle emission inventory can also be accomplished through fuel-based emission factors, i.e., grams of pollutants emitted per unit of fuel burned, combined with fuel sales data. Singer and Harley (1996) demonstrated this approach in estimating CO emissions for the city of Los Angeles. They computed average CO emission factors by model year and by vehicle type (cars and trucks). They also computed a weighted average by using vehicle age distribution and fuel economy. The results indicate that this approach has several advantages:\n\nFuel-based emission factors are based on measurements from large, on-road samples, which include malfunctioning and tampered vehicles. Measurements can be made from remote sensing and\/or tunnel studies. In contrast, activity-based emission factors are based on limited samples and many of them are based on certification tests for standard driving cycles.\n\nFuel use data are easily obtained and are more accurate than activity data.\n\nAlthough this approach offers advantages, there are no such fuel-based emission factors available for toxic air pollutants and criteria pollutants other than CO. More effort is needed to compute the fuel-based emission factors rather than developing activity-based emission factors.\n\nA third potential approach for deriving toxic emissions from mobile sources is to estimate TOG and PM emissions with activity-based emission factors and speciate the TOG and PM emissions by using speciation profiles. TOG includes all hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alcohols, and other oxygenated compounds.\n\nThe TOG and PM profiles, as well as the amount of TOG and PM emissions, may vary with vehicle category, fuel type, emission control technology (noncatalyst, oxidation catalyst, three-way catalyst, three-way plus oxidation catalyst), level of vehicle maintenance, and operating mode. In addition, evaporative emission speciation profiles differ from exhaust emission profiles because they consist of more volatile fuel components with no combustion products. Discussions in the following sub-sections focus on estimating TOG and PM emissions and the availability of speciation profiles.\n\nThe estimation process for TOG and PM emissions can be represented by the simple equation shown below:\n\nComposite Emission Factor (grams\/mile) or (grams\/trip)\n\n*\n\nTravel Activity VMT (miles) or Trips\n\n=\n\nEmissions of TOG or PM (grams)\n\n(4-1)\n\nThere are three common emission factor models: MOBILE5 (a or c), EMFAC7F, and PART5. These models take into account the effects of numerous vehicle parameters on the amounts of pollutants emitted.\n\n4-4-1-1. Introduction to Emission Factor Models\n\nMOBILE5a is the most recent version of the EPA MOBILE models. This model follows the calculation procedures in the compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors - Volume II: Highway Mobile Sources (AP-42, 4th edition, September 1985; Supplement A to AP-42 Vol. II, January 1991). It provides emissions factors of hydrocarbons for eight vehicle types in two regions (low and high altitude) of the country. MOBILE5a is used in the preparation of emission inventories required by the CAA for non-California areas. Ontario uses MOBILE5c to estimate TOG emissions. MOBILE5c is a modified version of MOBILE5a reflecting the base emission rate and deterioration rate of Canadian vehicles.\n\nThe California Air Resource Board (CARB) has developed and maintains its own emission factor model for use in the state of California. EMFAC7F is the latest version of the model. It produces composite emission factors for TOG and particulate matter.\n\nThe basic structure of MOBILE5a and EMFAC7F is similar. However, a significant difference between these two models is the way that each model allocates emissions associated with a vehicle trip. EMFAC7F produces separate emission factors for cold starts and hot starts in units of grams per trip, and for hot stabilized vehicle operation in units of grams per mile. On the other hand, MOBILE5a spreads the emissions from vehicle starts over the entire trip so it provides a single emission factor in units of grams per mile for both starts and stabilized vehicle operation. These differences affect the travel-related data requirements of the models.\n\nThe PART5 model was developed by the EPA Office of Mobile Sources. It calculates particle emission factors, including exhaust particulate, brakewear, tirewear, and reentrained road dust, for particle sizes of 1-10 mm. PART5 is consistent with MOBILE5a in format and fleet characterization data.\n\nAccording to the survey results, the Great Lakes States and Ontario have used MOBILE5 (a or c) in the preparation of their emission inventories for VOC. New York has also used PART5 to estimate PM10 emissions. With reasonable default values, MOBILE5 (a or c) input parameters are available or could be available for each county in the Great Lakes States and for each defined UTM grid in Ontario. Thus, Section 4-4-1-2 and Section 4-4-1-3 discuss MOBILE5a and the travel activity corresponding to MOBILE5a emission factors in detail, respectively.\n\n4-4-1-2. The MOBILE5a Model\n\nMOBILE5a model has five core components:\n\nBasic emission rates (BERs)\n\nFleet characteristics\n\nCorrection factors\n\nFuel characteristics\n\nEmission control programs\n\nThe basic emission rates are idealized rates based on standardized vehicle. The other four components adjust the idealized rates in the model so that the estimated emission rates are more representative of emissions from a vehicle operating under the actual conditions. Equation 4-2 illustrates the relationship between these components.\n\nThe running loss emissions depend on several variables: the average speed of travel, the ambient temperature, the volatility (RVP) of the fuel, and the length of the trip. Please note that the trip length refers to the duration of the trip (how long the vehicle has been traveling), not to the distance traveled in the trip (how far the vehicle has been driven). Test data show that for any given average speed, ambient temperature, and fuel volatility, running loss emissions are zero to negligible at first, but increase significantly as the duration of the trip is extended and the fuel tank, fuel lines, and engine become heated. MOBILE5a models running losses as a direct function of the input temperature, fuel volatility, and average speed. The user has option of either selecting an internal weighting of trip lengths or specifying trip length distributions. The default trip length distribution in MOBILE5a is shown below:\n\nUnder 10 minutes\n\n6.744%\n\n11 to 20 minutes\n\n18.507%\n\n21 to 30 minutes\n\n16.775%\n\n31 to 40 minutes\n\n13.108%\n\n41 to 50 minutes\n\n8.335%\n\n51 minutes and longer\n\n36.531%\n\nTotal\n\n100%\n\nAlthough diurnal, hot soak, and running loss evaporative emissions are related to vehicle travel, only running loss emissions are directly impacted by travel-related parameters input to MOBILE5a. The remaining discussion of MOBILE5a will focus on exhaust emissions.\n\na). Basic Emission Rates (BERs)\n\nBasic emission rates are expressed in the form of linear equations in MOBILE5a for each vehicle type\/pollutant\/model year group. These linear equations consist of a zero-mile level, or y-intercept, and one or two deterioration rates, or slopes (increase in emissions per 10,000 miles accumulated mileage). The BERs are developed by operating a small number of vehicles under tightly controlled standard test conditions. No need exists for modification of BERs in MOBILE5a by the Great Lakes States. However, in order to develop emission factors for the Ontario Province, the use of MOBILE5c is necessary. In MOBILE5c, Environment Canada revised the BERs, deterioration rates, and technology penetration rates for the Canadian fleet.\n\nEPA has assumed the default values for some operating mode mix inputs as the coefficients in Equation 4-3.\n\nBER = 0.206*cold start + 0.521*stabilized + 0.273*hot start\n\n(4-3)\n\nb). Fleet Characteristics\n\nMOBILE5a produces emission factors for the all eight categories of vehicles:\n\nThe emission factor for each individual category represents all the vehicle makers and models in the category. For example, the emission factor for LDGV represents all makers of gasoline powered passenger cars including Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Toyota, etc., of all ages, that are assumed to be operating in the analysis year. The average emission rate for each of the eight vehicle categories is significantly affected by the age distribution and the rate of mileage accumulation within the vehicle category. MOBILE5a assumes that 25 model years of vehicles comprise the fleet. The BERs characterize emissions for each specific model year in the vehicle fleet. The VMT fraction for each model year can be calculated as follows:\n\n(4-4)\n\nWhere:\n\nMILESm\n\n=\n\nannual mileage accumulation for each model year m;\n\nREGm\n\n=\n\nregistration fraction for model year m;\n\nn\n\n=\n\ntotal number of model years in fleet.\n\nMOBILE5a provides the user the option of using either a national average VMTm or data that characterize local conditions.\n\nIn addition, the composite (all vehicle, or fleetwide) emission factors are dependent on the vehicle miles traveled mix (VMT mix) which specifies the fraction of total highway VMT that is accumulated by each of the eight vehicle categories. MOBILE5a uses national average values for VMT mix as defaults. The user also can employ data more representative of local conditions.\n\nc). Correction Factors\n\nIn MOBILE5a, emission factors are calculated by multiplying the BERs by a series of correction factors including temperature, operating mode, and speed. The calculation can be simplified by the following equation.\n\nSince the BERs are developed based on standard testing conditions under which temperature is within a range of 68 to 86oF, MOBILE5a applies correction factors to the BERs for temperatures outside this range. The user should obtain temperature data and develop appropriate temperature profiles for a given mobile source analysis.\n\nOperating Mode Correction Factor\n\nAs discussed previously, the operating mode affects exhaust emissions. They are higher in start modes and are reduced significantly once the catalytic converter and engine warm up. MOBILE5a applies operating mode mix corrections to light duty vehicles. It adjusts the BERs with operating modes in two ways: bag correction and bag weight adjustments. The operating modes are usually referred to as bags because the vehicle exhaust is collected in three separate teflon bags for each operating mode in emission factor measurements (bag 1 for the cold start mode, bag 2 for the hot stabilized mode, and bag 3 for the hot start mode). The model automatically makes separate bag corrections to alter the BERs so that they are more representative of the vehicle fleet being modeled. The bag correction factors for the catalyst vehicles are based on vehicle mileage characteristics of the fleet. However, the bag weight adjustments are made by the user through changing the weight of each bag (operating mode mix fractions) to alter the BERs. Two technology types (catalyst and non-catalyst) are also considered in developing the bag weights because technology type affects the time required for a vehicle to warm up and change operating modes. MOBILE5a assumes that the percent of miles traveled in the stabilized mode is the same for both technology types and sets default operating mode weighting factors as follows:\n\nBER = 0.206*cold start + 0.521*stabilzed + 0.273*hot start\n\n(4-6)\n\nSpeed Correction Factor\n\nBoth exhaust and running loss evaporative emissions vary significantly with the average speed. The \"speed\" in MOBILE5a is simply the total trip distance divided by the total trip time, including all stopped delay times. The basic emission rates in MOBILE5a are an approximation of the average rates of emission over a trip with an average speed of 19.6 miles per hour (mph). There are three speed correction regimes in MOBILE5a: low-speed (under 19.6 mph), mid-range (19.6 to 48 mph), and high- speed (48 to 65 mph). An example of the general relationship between speed and VOC emission factor is shown in Figure 4-2.\n\nEvaporative emissions and exhaust emissions (to a lesser extent) vary with fuel volatility. The BERs are developed based on gasoline with volatility of 9.0 psi as measured by Reid vapor pressure (RVP). MOBILE5a adjusts the emission factors by using RVP correction factors for the fuel with volatilities other than 9.0 psi RVP.\n\nThe use of oxygenates (alcohols or ethers) in gasoline and reformulated gasoline can reduce TOG emissions. MOBILE5a is also capable of modeling the impacts of oxygenated fuel and reformulated gasoline on emission factors.\n\ne). Emission Control Programs\n\nMany areas in the United States have implemented inspection and maintenance (I\/M) or anti-tampering programs (examples of emission control tampering are misfueling, removal or disablement of catalytic converters) to further reduce mobile source emissions. The BERs are developed from vehicles not affected by these emission control programs. MOBILE5a has the capability of modeling the impacts of the control programs. The procedures used in the model to estimate the emission reduction from control programs are complex, especially for exhaust emissions. The calculations are based on vehicle technology parameters and design and effectiveness of the vehicle emission control programs, but are not travel-related parameters.\n\nf). MOBILE 5a Inputs\n\nThe appropriate MOBILE5a inputs should be determined by following EPA's recommendations and suggestions in Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation: Volume IV: Mobile Sources (EPA, 1992) and User's Guide to MOBILE5 (EPA, 1994). Table 4-1 summarizes the guidance and sources of the input parameters.\n\n4-4-1-3. Travel Activity\n\nOutput from MOBILE5a together with travel activity expressed in terms of Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) yields an estimate of emissions for TOG. VMT can be estimated from direct observations or from travel demand network models. Both VMT methods are related to the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) developed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration. Both EPA and DOT have endorsed the HPMS as the most appropriate source of VMT estimates. HPMS estimates VMT based on direct observation of travel. On the other hand, travel demand network models estimate VMT values based on many assumptions and estimates, not on direct observation of travel in that year. With their time-consuming and resource-intensive updating procedures, travel demand network models are not a practical alternative to HPMS as an annual VMT estimation method. However, EPA encourages states to use travel demand network models to temporally (i.e., time of day) and spatially allocate VMT, and EPA also allows the use of those models to estimate speed and other input parameters for the MOBILE5a model.\n\nSome states have more comprehensive and more accurate monitoring systems than HPMS (IL EPA, 1993; MPCA, 1995). These state-operated systems estimate VMT on all roads in the respective state including private roads and also use all available reliable counts and other data, whereas HPMS does not include private road data and uses rather small sample sizes. Moreover, these state-operated systems make VMT estimates from large samples, and these estimates are internally more consistent and statistically more robust than HPMS. For the states that have their own monitoring systems, it is recommended these states use VMT estimates from their own monitoring systems.\n\nIn the following sections, the discussions will be focused on the HPMS approaches to VMT estimates.\n\na). Overview of Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS)\n\nUnder the HPMS, traffic counts are taken on unique sample panels for each Federal Aid Urbanized Area (FAUA) within the state, then are adjusted for day-of-week and season and expanded to include the area's entire roadway network. The HPMS consists of all public highways or roads within a state. The reporting strata for the HPMS include area types and functional classes shown in Figure 4-3. A third level of stratification is based on 13 volume groups to reduce sample size, insure the inclusion of high volume sections in the sample, and increase the precision of VMT at a lower sample rate. The HPMS provides a statistically valid, reliable, and consistent VMT data base for analyses within states and between states.\n\nFigure 4-3. Area types and functional classes in the reporting strata of the HPMS\n\nb). Estimating VMT in Large Urban Areas\n\nIf the boundaries of an inventoried area (such as a county) are coincident with the boundaries of the FAUA, then the county VMT should be the HPMS VMT for each functional system.\n\nIf the boundaries of an inventoried area are entirely within the boundaries of the FAUA, then the FAUA VMT by HPMS functional system should be allocated to the county on the basis of the number of roadway miles according to Equation 4-7.\n\n(4-7)\n\nWhere\n\nIA\n\n=\n\nInventoried Area\n\nFAUA\n\n=\n\nFederal Aid Urbanized Area\n\nf\n\n=\n\nFunctional Class\n\nv\n\n=\n\nVolume Group\n\nIf an emission inventory area is entirely outside the boundaries of all FAUAs, states may use any reasonable method to estimate VMT on the separate functional systems within the area. However, the recommended method in a completely rural area is based on the expansion factor used for the universe of rural samples within the state. Within HPMS, all rural areas within the state are grouped into one sampling universe. This recommended method is described by Equation 4-8.\n\n(4-8)\n\nWhere\n\nIA\n\n=\n\nInventoried Area\n\nHPMS\n\n=\n\nHPMS Statewide Rural Area\n\nf\n\n=\n\nFunctional Class\n\nv\n\n=\n\nVolume Group\n\nIf some of the inventoried area is inside an FAUA and some of the inventoried area lies outside of any FAUA, then VMT in that portion of the inventoried are within the FAUA should be estimated by equation 4-7, while VMT in the portion outside of the FAUA should be estimated according to Equation 4-8.\n\nAs mentioned previously, HPMS sample panels do not include local functional systems. HPMS can be supplemented by state-provided estimates of VMT in the local functional systems. These estimates are based on a method chosen by the state in light of its own circumstances and generally are not based on current ground counts at statistically representative sites. Increasing the accuracy of these estimates is important for the emission inventory.\n\nc). Estimating VMT in Rural and Small Urban Areas\n\nThe general method of estimating VMT in rural and small urban areas is to apportion the statewide VMT to the county or other area for which mobile source emission estimates are required. Statewide VMT data are available directly from state transportation agencies or from Table VM-2 in \"Highway Statistics\" which is published annually by the Federal Highway Administration. These data are prepared by all state transportation agencies and based upon and consistent with HPMS. Several options can be used to apportion VMT, such as roadway miles, motor vehicle registrations, population, and fuel sales. The selection of options is dependent on the availability of the required data. However, the recommended method for estimating VMT is by roadway miles. Equation 4-9 describes the estimate method.\n\nWhere\n\nVMTArea, f\n\n=\n\nestimated annual areawide VMT for\n\nfunctional class f\n\nFf\n\n=\n\napportioning factor to be applied to statewide VMT to estimate areawide VMT for functional class f\n\nVMTState, f\n\n=\n\ntotal statewide annual VMT for functional class f\n\nThe apportioning factor can be derived as the ratio of a parameter in the area of interest to the parameter in the state. The parameters include roadway miles of functional class f, total motor vehicles of all types registered, total population, and total quantity (gallons) of gasoline and diesel fuel sold. Information on total quality (gallons) of gasoline and diesel fuel sold can be obtained from a state revenue agency or from Table MF-25 and MF-26 in \"Highway Statistics\".\n\nIf a state transportation agency is capable of reporting VMT in rural and small urban areas directly, the indirect method for apportioning statewide VMT should not be used.\n\nd). Seasonal and Daily Adjustment\n\nIn Section 3-2-3-2, it has been decided to use at least 6 typical days per year to estimate the annual emissions. HPMS provides annual average daily traffic (AADT) VMT. These AADT VMT should be adjusted for seasonal effects and daily effects. The adjustment factors should be developed by each state and province based on direct observation or travel demand network models.\n\n4-4-2. Procedures for Estimating Toxic Air Emissions by Speciating TOG and PM Emissions\n\nThere are two methods to estimate the fleet-average toxic emissions: use fleet composite speciation profiles or use individual speciation profiles which only can be applied to specific vehicles. The first method (fleet composite speciation profiles) requires much less effort while the second method (individual speciation profiles) is more time consuming but provides more accurate results. The choice of methods depends on the availability of speciation profiles, the accuracy requirement of the emission inventory, and the availability of staff and dollar resources. In some cases, emission estimations may be made by using a combination of data from these two methods. This section discusses procedures for estimating toxic emissions for each of these methods.\n\nDefine each day of the year as one of the \"typical days\". Determine number of days in each category of the typical days.\n\nMultiple those numbers by the emission values estimated for each typical day.\n\nSum emissions for the same pollutant obtained in the above procedure.\n\nThese procedures for estimating toxic emissions at the county level are explained in Equation (4-10).\n\n(4-10)\n\nwhere Mj\n\n=\n\nAnnual mass of emissions of the jth pollutant.\n\nEFTOG(or PM),n,f\n\n=\n\nFleet TOG or PM emission factor for the fth functional class at the nth typical day.\n\nVMTf,n\n\n=\n\nFleet VMT in the fth functional class at the nth typical day.\n\n%Wj\n\n=\n\nWeight percent of the jth pollutant in the TOG or PM emissions.\n\nNDn\n\n=\n\nNumber of days in the nth typical day.\n\nThe appropriate fleet composite speciation profiles can be developed from onroad measurements or statistical analyses of ambient measurements.\n\n4-4-2-2. Using Individual Speciation Profiles\n\nStep I. Estimating Emissions for Each Typical Day at Each County\n\nRun MOBILE5a (or c) and PART5 to estimate TOG and PM emission factors for each road functional class for each fuel type within each vehicle category. The emission factors should be use separately for exhaust, diurnal, hot soak, and running loss emissions.\n\nMultiply the emission factors by the corresponding fraction of fuel market share.\n\nMultiply the emission factors by the corresponding VMT and VMT mix for exhaust or running loss emissions. Multiply the emission factors by the corresponding daily trip number for the hot soak evaporation. Nothing is needed to multiply by the emission factor for diurnal emissions because the emission factor is in units of grams per day.\n\nSum TOG or PM emissions of all functional classes from the same process within the same vehicle category using the same fuel.\n\nAllocate the emissions to each control technology which may apply by using site-specific weighting factors.\n\nApply speciation profiles to those TOG and PM emissions.\n\nSimply sum the emissions of exhaust, diurnal, hot soak, and running loss within the same vehicle type using the same fuel and with the same control technology.\n\nSum the emissions of the same species for all control technologies using the same fuel within the same vehicle category.\n\nAggregate the emissions of all fuel types within each vehicle category.\n\nSum the emissions of each vehicle category to the fleet emissions.\n\nStep II. Estimating Annual Emissions for Each County\n\nDefine each day of the year as one of the \"typical days\". Determine the number of days in each category of typical days.\n\nMultiple those numbers by the emission values estimated for each typical day in Step I, 10.\n\nSum the emissions for the same pollutant obtained in the above procedure.\n\nThe following equations illustrate the procedures to estimate annual emissions by using individual speciation profiles (for exhaust and running loss emissions).\n\nwhere\n\nMTOG(or PM), a,k,l,n,b\n\n=\n\nTOG (or PM) mass of emissions for the kth process using the lth fuel within the bth vehicle category with ath control technology at the nth typical day\n\nEFTOG(or PM), f,k,l,n,b\n\n=\n\nFleet TOG (or PM) emission factor for the fth road functional class and kth process using the lth fuel within the bth vehicle category at the nth typical day\n\nFMl,b\n\n=\n\nFraction of market share for the lth fuel within the bth vehicle category\n\nVMTf,k,n\n\n=\n\nVMT in the fth road functional class and kth process at the nth typical day\n\nVMb,n\n\n=\n\nFraction of total highway VMT that is accumulated by the bth vehicle category at the nth typical day\n\nCTa,b,n\n\n=\n\nWeight factor for the ath control technology within the bth vehicle category at the nth typical day\n\nMj,n\n\n=\n\nMass of emissions of the jth pollutant at the nth typical day\n\n%Wj,kl,a,b\n\n=\n\nWeight percent of the jth pollutant in the TOG or PM emissions from kth process using the lth fuel within the bth vehicle category with ath control technology\n\nMj\n\n=\n\nAnnual mass of emissions of the jth pollutant\n\nNDn\n\n=\n\nNumber of days in the nth typical day\n\n4-4-2-3. Concerns about Speciation Profiles\n\nThe EPA Emission Factor and Methodologies Section has pointed out that EPA doesn't recommend using SPECIATE to estimate air toxic emissions except mobile source TOG profiles (Pope 1995a). In 1992, EPA updated the speciation profiles and provided the most current and complete estimate of toxic emission components of TOG emissions for gasoline-powered vehicles. However, the EPA TOG speciation profiles (EPA, 1993a) do not provide information for all the pollutants (e.g., polycyclic organic matter) that will be inventoried in the Great Lakes region. Also, there is only one TOG speciation profile available for diesel vehicles and this profile only indicates weight percentages in TOG emissions for four pollutants of interest. Therefore, additional information sources are shown below.\n\nThe California Air Resources Board (CARB, 1991), Auto\/Oil Air Quality Improvement Research Program (Sawyer, 1993), and System Applications International (Ligocki, 1995) have also developed TOG speciation profiles for gasoline and diesel vehicles. The Desert Research Institute (Fujita, 1995a) developed a composite VOC speciation profile for diesel truck exhaust based on ambient air measurements made in Arizona and a summer and a winter VOC profile for gasoline automotive exhaust emissions based on both ambient air measurements and a chemical mass balance receptor model. The Desert Research Institute (Fujita, 1995b) also derived 78 VOC (or NMHC) speciation profiles, including 44 for motor vehicle exhaust, 30 for gasoline vapor, 4 for diesel vapor, from measurements conducted by their institute and by other people in recent years.\n\nIn addition, EPA has reviewed emission mass fractions for four TOG toxics (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde) for gasoline vehicles by catalyst technology and fuel oxygenated type and content, and for diesel vehicles in the \"Motor Vehicle-Related Air Toxics Study\" (EPA, 1993).\n\nIn general, fewer speciation data exist for diesel exhaust than for gasoline exhaust. Although heavy-duty diesel vehicles contribute a large portion of diesel emissions, most diesel speciation profiles are for light-duty diesel vehicles. Additional study is needed to develop more speciation data for diesel vehicles. Table 4-2 shows the existing EPA and CARB TOG speciation profiles for highway vehicles.\n\nThe PM profiles in SPECIATE version 1.5 (EPA, 1993a) are not of high enough quality to be used to estimate toxic air emissions for mobile sources (Pope, 1995b). Gasoline particulate matter and diesel particulate matter are considered as individual toxic air pollutants by EPA (EPA, 1993). Diesel particulate matter is under consideration as a toxic air pollutant by the CARB also (CARB, 1994). The PART5 model estimates emissions of particulate matter, including lead, sulfate and soluble organic particulate. Efforts are needed to link these estimates to individual air toxics, especially metals and compounds other than lead. Table 4-3 presents the existing EPA and CARB PM speciation profiles for highway vehicles. Because leaded gasoline has been prohibited for use in highway vehicles since January 1, 1996, the speciation profiles for leaded gasoline are not included in the table.\n\nIn addition to the information provided above, TOG and PM profiles may be derived from the EPA report series, entitled \"Locating and Estimating Air Toxic Emissions,\" and from recent measurements and research results.\n\nAlthough speciation data are not adequate to estimate toxic air pollutants emissions, combining TOG and PM emissions with speciation profiles is currently the most feasible approach for the Great Lakes States and Ontario in preparation of the regional toxic air emission inventory for highway vehicles.\n\n4-5.

The Environmental Permitting Regulations require that processes identified by the regulations must have an Authorisation to operate.\n\nThere are currently two types of process classification - Part A and Part B.\n\nPart B processes are those that have the potential to cause only air pollution and include activities such as vehicle re-spraying, furniture manufacture and unloading of petrol.\n\nThe legal framework for these processes is known as Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) and has been incorporated into the Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR).\n\nWho Regulates the Processes?\n\nPart A processes are regulated by the Environment Agency while Part B processes are controlled by local authorities.\n\nWe are responsible for authorising and inspecting all Part B processes within Eastbourne. Part B regulation is known as Local Air Pollution Prevention and Control (LAPPC).\n\nHow to Apply for a Permit\n\nAny person operating a process that requires an authorisation can apply to us online through the Business Link in the South East website using the link from this page, or contact us using the form below.\n\nWe then issue an authorisation in accordance with government guidance, including consulting with relevant members of the public and other organisations. Any permits issued must include conditions which say how pollution is to be minimised.\n\nThe operator of the prescribed process must comply with the conditions of the authorisation and they will be subject to inspection to ensure this is the case. The operator must also pay an annual charge to cover the council's costs of checking the permit is complied with.\n\nYou can find out more about the duties of local authorities to control industrial air pollution on the DEFRA website."}

It is the intent of this subchapter to effectuate such reductions by requiring compliance by affected sources with prescribed emission limitations by specified deadlines, which limitations may be met through alternative methods of compliance provided by an emission allocation and transfer system. It is also the purpose of this subchapter to encourage energy conservation, use of renewable and clean alternative technologies, and pollution prevention as a long-range strategy, consistent with the provisions of this subchapter, for reducing air pollution and other adverse impacts of energy production and use."}
{"text":"Air filters used in ventilating systems are called upon to remove an extremely wide variety of contaminants from the air, ranging from soot and smoke and the common dusts to mold spores, bacteria and pollen. Particle sizes vary from less than a micron (.000039\") to insects and leaves. The concentration will vary hourly, daily and seasonally.\n\nThese variables combined with filtering requirements that range from the simple needs of a household furnace to the absolute filtration required for a clean room make air cleaning a complex science. Filter selection should, therefore, be made by a qualified engineer or in cooperation with the filter manufacturer.\n\nThe same variables that affect filter selection also contribute to the problem of determining when a filter has reached the tolerable limit of its effective life span as a result of the accumulation of contaminants. Because of wide variation in contaminant load in the air being filtered, time is an uncertain measurement. Visual inspection of the condition of the filter tells little or nothing. The most widely used method of checking filter condition is to measure pressure drop across the filter by means of an air filter gage. The air filter gage measures pressure drop across the filter for the purpose of determining whether or not the filter is operating within its design range of effective utilization."}
{"text":"arbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas that is invisible, odorless, colorless, non-irritating, and tasteless. CO is a by-product of in-\n\ncomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials. With CO being as old as fire itself, one can only imagine the number of cases of CO poisoning that would have been seen in the emergency de- partment at \"Homo Erectus Community Hospital\" had it existed 700 to 800 thousand years ago when the cave dwelling Peking Man began using fire for cooking and cave warming! Ironically, CO is manufactured in the body as a result of the\n\nbreakdown of hemoglobin. Consequently, normal people may have a COHb concentration of 0.5% in their blood. Smokers often have COHb levels of 10% or higher.\n\nHistorical Background Not until coal was used as a domestic fuel did CO poisoning\n\nbecome a recognized medical problem. Homes and industry re- lied on gas from coal and oil for heating and lighting. Edgar Allen Poe (1809-1849) unwittingly wrote about his symptoms of CO poisoning from gas lighting in many of his short stories. In his fit- tingly titled story, \"Loss of Breath,\" Poe wrote, \"The sensations of my illness were much like those of a man upon the gallows: I heard my heart beating with violence - the veins in my hands and wrists were swelling to nearly bursting \u2013 my temple throbbed tem- pestuously - and I felt my eyes were starting from my sockets... Confusion crowded upon confusion like a wave upon a wave.\" Poe related numerous other symptoms in his writings. After Poe's death on October 7, 1849, the Baltimore health commissioner listed the cause of death as \"congestion of the brain.\" In 1857, in France, a French physiologist named Claude\n\nBernard carried out an animal experiment and noticed how the animal's venous blood was as cherry red as blood in arterial cir- culation. Still puzzled as to what CO did to kill the animal, Bernard took a sample of arterial blood from a healthy animal, placed this blood beneath a layer of liquid mercury in a test tube containing CO gas. Maintaining an air-tight seal, Bernard shook the tube to achieve contact between the blood and the CO. He then analyzed the gas in the test tube and found it was oxygen- enriched. Bernard concluded that the CO displaced the O2 in the blood and that the CO \"remained fixed in the blood corpuscles,\" causing the demise of the animal.\n\nEpidemiology CO is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality by poi-\n\nsoning in the United States. Because many cases of CO poisoning\n\ngo undetected and unreported, the actual incidence of this poi- soning is unknown. Estimates are that approximately one-third of all cases are undiagnosed because CO poisoning mimics a variety of systemic diseases. Common sources of CO are wood and gas burning fire-\n\nand CO bind reversibly with hemoglobin. These two gases compete for binding with the four hemes in the hemoglobin molecule. However, the magnitude of hemoglobin's affinity for CO is 210 to 240 times greater than for O2. Additionally, the binding of CO to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) causes conformational changes to hemoglobin's tetrameric structure, thereby increasing the affinity of the re- maining heme groups for O2. In other words, when a CO mol- ecule binds with one of the four hemes on a hemoglobin molecule, the other three hemes cling to O2 more avidly. The result is a leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, and a compromised tissue O2 delivery. The greater affin- ity of hemoglobin for CO accounts for the fact that only a small amount of inspired CO causes a large COHb level in the blood. For example, inhalation of 0.1% CO produces a COHb level of 10%. Myoglobin is another heme-containing molecule that\n\nbinds avidly with CO. Skeletal and cardiac muscle are ad- versely affected by this binding. Carboxymyoglobin poses a se- rious threat to a CO victim because the myocardium can be severely deprived of oxygenation. The associated cardiac is- chemia can cause lethal dysrythmias. The binding of CO to car- diac myoglobin also has a depressant effect on the heart, producing hypotension. Both of these effects exacerbate the de- creased tissue O2 delivery. Interestingly, CO dissociates from myoglobin much more slowly than CO does from hemoglobin. Consequently, as CO leaves myoglobin, CO re-enters the blood where the COHb level rises again. Outside the vasculature CO binds with cytochrome A3, an enzyme involved in the electron transport chain within the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation involves the production of ATP from ADP and phosphate by harnessing the energy released as elec- trons are transferred during a series of oxi-"}
{"text":"BPDnews.com\n\nPublic Safety Advisory Relative to Carbon Monoxide Poisoning:\n\nThe Boston Police Department has received several calls relative to carbon monoxide poisoning. Specifically, the BPD has received several calls relative to individuals being overcome by carbon monoxide while sitting or attempting to stay warm in vehicles. Preliminary information indicates that dangerous levels of carbon monoxide are entering cars as a result of exhaust pipes being blocked by snow. The BPD would like to remind community members to be cognizant of the dangers specific to carbon monoxide. Whether in a car or a home, repercussions can be deadly. As such, community members should be aware of the enclosed safety tips.\n\nWhat is carbon monoxide? Often referred to as the silent killer, CO is a gas you cannot see, taste or smell. It's created when fossil fuels such as kerosene, gasoline, natural gas, propane, methane or wood do not burn properly. Where does carbon monoxide come from? CO poisoning can result from faulty furnaces or other heating appliances, portable generators, water heaters, clothes dryers or cars left running in garages. What are the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning? Symptoms of CO poisoning include headache, nausea and drowsiness. Exposure to undetected high levels of carbon monoxide can be fatal.\n\nPrecautions to be taken:\u2022 If shoveling out your vehicle, be sure to remove any snow or ice that may be blocking the exhaust pipe.\n\u2022 If using a fire place, be sure to open the damper for proper ventilation before using a fireplace.\n\u2022 Avoid using an oven or stovetop to heat your home as the CO gas could have harmful effects to both people and pets.\n\u2022 Make sure all fuel-burning vented equipment is vented to the outside to avoid CO poisoning. Keep the venting for exhaust clear and unblocked.\n\u2022 If you need to warm a vehicle, remove it from the garage immediately after starting it. Never run a vehicle or other fueled engine or motor indoors, even if garage doors are open. Make sure the exhaust pipe of a running vehicle is not blocked with snow, ice or other materials. The CO gas might kill people and pets.\n\u2022 Make sure vents for the dryer, furnace, stove and fireplace are clear of snow and other debris.\n\u2022 Only use barbecue grills outside, away from all doors, windows, vents and other building openings. Some grills can produce CO gas. Never use grills inside the home or the garage, even if the doors are open.\n\u2022 Use portable generators outdoors in well-ventilated areas away from all doors, windows, vents and other building openings to prevent exhaust fumes from entering the home.\n\nIf you experience symptoms of CO poisoning:\u2022 Immediately move to a fresh air location (outdoors or by an open window or door). Make sure everyone inside the home is accounted for.\n\u2022 Call 9-1-1 or the fire department from a fresh air location (outdoors or by an open window). Remain at a fresh air location until emergency personnel arrive to assist you."}
{"text":"\u2022Effects Of Car Pollution On Environment\n\nEffects Of Car Pollution On Environment\n\nCar and other automobiles have a major impact upon the environment. They are responsible for most forms of pollution, including air, water, noise and land pollution, and thus, the effect of car pollution on environment cannot be emphasized enough.\n\nIn fact, a fact sheet from the US EPA has said that when a person drives a car everyday, it is the person's most polluting activity on a daily basis.Several researches have been conducting surveys and studies to research other effects of car pollution on the environment. Some of the effects of car pollution on the environment are presented below.\n\nAccording to a study, car exhaust particulates result in more cloud formation in the atmosphere, but cause less rain. The increased levels of these particulates in the atmosphere result in a decrease of low-level winds, which adversely impacts the amount of available wind power.\n\nExhaust from car contains many pollutants including hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Each pollutant can adversely affect the environment by either contributing to the smog problem or in causing the greenhouse effect. This is potentially dangerous, since the excess heat in the atmosphere, resulting from car pollution, can alter the weather patterns, and can make them to become unpredictable. This would lead to more natural disasters and catastrophes.\n\nThe car scrap can also affect the environment. A 1996 EPA report estimated that about 800 million tires were stockpiled in dumps across the country. These tire dumps, classified as an \"ongoing environmental hazard\" provide ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Additionally, it poses a very serious fire hazard. When a tire dump catches fire, the burning tire casings emit dangerous toxic gases, and are very difficult to extinguish.\n\nPollution adversely affects the health of many living organisms, including humans. Poor air quality can cause disorder related respiratory systems, cardiovascular diseases, throat inflammation, chest pain and congestion. It aggravates an existing respiratory problem like asthma or bronchitis. Moreover, poor air quality can also affect the skin and eyes by causing rashes on the skin and irritation in the eyes.

A set of criteria pollutants were identified, and legal limits were set. Although these pollutants continue to exist in our air, they generally present at lower levels. This unit explores each of the criteria pollutants, their physical properties, health effects, environmental effects, what their major producers are, and what can be done to reduce the levels of each.\n\nAir Pollution Powerpoint\n\nPurpose: This lecture begins with two case studies: the Donora fluoride fog disaster, and the great London Smog of 1952. These incidents are used to illustrate the dire health and environmental effects of air pollution when it is unregulated. The rest of the lecture centers around the passage of the Clean Air Act and its subsequent amendments. The specific pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, that are controlled by this act are reviewed. Students will learn the primary sources of each pollutant and what steps have been taken to reduce the emissions of each. A student notes outline is also available for this lecture.\n\nAir PollutionAcid Rain and pH Visualization Lab\n\nPurpose: This lab seeks to give students a more concrete understanding of the pH scale and how it applied to acid precipitation. Most students are familiar with the concept of the pH scale, and understand how to read it. However, few appreciate the exponential nature of the scale. For example, an acid of pH 4.0 is ten times stronger than an acid of pH 5.0. Students will perform a titration of eight simulated rainwater samples with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to get a more concrete sense of how much stronger of an acid different pH levels are.\n\nWebquest: Analyzing Air Pollution Using EPA AirData\n\nPurpose: The EPA AirData website allows the public to access air quality measurements taken by the EPA in every county in the United States. This is a great resource to provide a local context for the unit. Students will access the data specific for their county and determine the biggest polluters for each of the criteria pollutants as defined by the Clean Air Act.\n\nAir Pollution This study guide is sequentually based on the Powerpoint lecture from this unit"}

Arden Pope III, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.\n\n\"We might be able to reduce the underlying processes of some cardiovascular disease just by reducing the exposure to air pollutants. And possibly, there may be ways to mitigate the impacts of air pollution, such as anti-inflammatory medications or other interventions.\"\n\nThe research, which used data on more than half a million people, also poses a theory on the mechanisms responsible for pollution-related heart deaths -- increased inflammation and nervous system changes that affect heart rhythm.\n\nThe researchers found that about 45 percent of all deaths in the study population were due to cardiovascular diseases -- including heart attacks, heart failure and cardiac arrest. Respiratory disease accounted for only 8.2 percent of the deaths.\n\nPope and his colleagues used risk factor and mortality data collected between 1982 and 1998 by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention Study II (ACS-CPSII). The ongoing study included participants, aged 30 or older, living in U.S. metropolitan areas with available air pollution data.\n\nThe ACS-CPSII data were matched with air pollution data from up to 156 cities, mostly gathered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The analyses focused on microscopic particles in the air that measured less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter called PM2.5, which is also the size range of particles in cigarette smoke.\n\nOver the 16-year period, 22.5 percent of the people taking part in ACS-CPSII died. An analysis of those deaths, published in 2002, confirmed a clear association between air pollution and an increase in death rates.\n\nAn increase in PM2.5 of 10ug per cubic meter of air (ug\/m3) increased the risk of all cardiovascular diseases plus diabetes by 12 percent. For ischemic heart disease alone (the majority of which will lead to heart attack), the risk was 18 percent higher. For the combined category of arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms), heart failure and cardiac arrest, the risk was 13 percent higher.\n\nIn a sub-analysis, the researchers found that former smokers had a 26 percent greater risk of death due to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes compared to never smokers. Current smokers had a 94 percent higher risk of death. Air pollution conferred additional risk for smokers as well as nonsmokers. For respiratory disease, an increase in PM2.5 conferred twice the risk of death for former smokers compared to never smokers. The risk for current smokers was nearly four times greater. However, for respiratory disease deaths, researchers did not find additional risk from air pollution, Pope said.\n\n\"There is no question that active cigarette smoking is a much, much larger risk factor than air pollution,\" said Pope, an expert in the economic effects of disease. \"We don't know precisely how the two relate, but there is some evidence in our study that the mechanisms are similar or complementary.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nAir Pollution Linked to Chronic Heart Disease(June 5, 2012) \u2014 Cardiac patients living in high pollution areas were found to be over 40 percent more likely to have a second heart attack when compared to patients living in low pollution areas, according to a new ... > read more"}
{"text":"This Letter to the Editor is from Northville High School students Jimmy Tian, Edward Clifton, Allison Montambeau and Jessica Tyer. It stems from their research for their AP Environmental Science class.\n\nOn January 22, 2012, the famous football coach of the Penn State University Nittany Lions Joe Paterno died of complications from lung cancer. Most people think that lung cancer is simply a disease that smokers get.\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\nJoe Paterno was not a smoker, but he lived in a very high radon risk area, the Pennsylvania Appalachians, leading to much speculation that Joe Paterno died as a result of radon induced lung cancer. The Environmental Protection Agency states that, each year, 21,000 non-smokers die of lung cancer from the hidden killer gas, radon [1]. This means that radon kills more than home fires, drowning, and drunk driving put together. According to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, we live next to some of the highest risk areas in the state, such as Washtenaw and Jackson County [2].\n\nRadon, a radioactive, inert gas, is truly the silent killer. It strikes without any warning, being odorless, colorless, and tasteless. Radon does not even cause any physical symptoms, such as wheezing, rashes, or coughing. Nobody is exempt from this danger, and radon is an especially high risk to children and people who smoke. The only way that you can become aware of a radon threat in your home is through a radon testing kit. These kits are inexpensive and a solid investment in the health and livelihood of you and your loved ones.\n\nRadon occurs in all counties of the United States, although rates of occurrence vary greatly based on geology. Radon is typically formed from the radioactive decay of the naturally occurring uranium and thorium, which are most present in underlying granite bedrock. Radon becomes a threat when the gas seeps into the house through cracks or joints in floors or walls, and decays into solid daughter elements, which are also radioactive. These daughter elements stick to dust, and wrecks havoc on the human body when inhaled, as it may become stuck to the airways of the lung and unleash harmful. Radon is recognized as the number one source of day to day radiation exposure for normal Americans.\n\nRadon levels are measured by the amount of radiation released, as picocuries per liter (pCi\/L). The EPA recognizes levels of 4 pCi\/L to be the action limit, and it is estimated that as many as 15 percent of US households currently are at levels above that limit, and thus are unknowingly suffering from the effects of radiation exposure to the lungs.\n\nDespite the severity of the effects of radon exposure, protecting yourself from this dangerous gas is simple, relatively quick, and costs surprisingly little. An EPA approved home radon test kit costs less than fifteen dollars on average and can be purchased at Lowe's Home Improvement, Home Depot, and many other local businesses. When testing for radon, follow the instructions listed on the package and place the test kit on the lowest level of your home. The kit should be placed in a regularly used area and all outside windows and doors in the home should be sealed. Leave the kit in place for as long as the instructions dictate and ensure that it is not disturbed during testing. Once your test has been completed, take or mail the kit to the testing facility listed on the package. If your home receives a reading of 4 pCi\/L or higher, take a follow up test to verify and begin to take the recommended measures to reduce the radon levels in your home.\n\nThe loss of the famous Penn State football coach Joe Paterno affected sports fans across the country. With the use of simple home radon tests, you can protect yourself and your family from the dangerous gas that may have claimed an American sports icon. A simple home test can prevent radon-linked lung cancer and are regularly available across the state. It's better to be safe than sorry; test your home for radon today.\n\nThis was a great piece and I am glad to see high school students getting involved. I work for the Pennsylvania Lung Cancer Partnership and we are always trying to disspell the myth that only smokers can get lung cancer, when in fact at the point of diagnosis 65% of lung cancer patients are non-smokers; never smokers account for about 15%, while the rest may have quit years ago. This is truly a disease that needs more attention as it is the number one cancer killer; accounting for more deaths each year than prostate, colon, and breast cancer combined."}

In the 1960's, the American Lung Association adopted the long week promotion. In the 1970's, the promotion evolved into a month long campaign taking place in May, hence Clean Air Month. Over the years, Clean Air Month has made an impact on environmental education for the public. The campaign focuses on promoting daily practices that the public can use to improve air quality."}
{"text":"London's Great Smog of 52\u2032\n\nThis phenomena was the cause of over 12,000 fatalities, which is unbelievable in itself and reminds me of the start of a post-apocalyptic film where things go real bad. This horrible event, however, did trigger the wheels of change as the public's eyes opened up to the horrors of pollution, which then lead to developments in research, government regulation, and public awareness of the relationship between air quality and health.\n\nThe National Public Radio announcement during the time says: \"Roads were littered with abandoned cars. Midday concerts were cancelled due to total darkness. Archivists at the British Museum found smog lurking in the book stacks. Cattle in the city's Smithfield market were killed and thrown away before they could be slaughtered and sold \u2014 their lungs were black. On the second day of the smog, Saturday, Dec. 6, 500 people died in London. When the ambulances stopped running, thousands of gasping Londoners walked through the smog to the city's hospitals. The lips of the dying were blue. Heavy smoking and chronic exposure to pollution had already weakened the lungs of those who fell ill during the smog. Particulates and acids in the killer brew finished the job by triggering massive inflammations. In essence, the dead had suffocated.\"\n\nThe last day of the fog, Dec. 9, 1952, took 900 more lives, but then the merciful wind swept in unexpectedly and it all vanished like a bad dream."}
{"text":"Tiny particles of air pollution contain more hazardous ingredients in non-white and low-income communities than in affluent white ones, a new study shows.\n\nThe greater the concentration of Hispanics, Asians, African Americans or poor residents in an area, the more likely that potentially dangerous compounds such as vanadium, nitrates and zinc are in the mix of fine particles they breathe.\n\nLatinos had the highest exposures to the largest number of these ingredients, while whites generally had the lowest.\n\nThe findings of the Yale University research add to evidence of a widening racial and economic gap when it comes to air pollution. Communities of color and those with low education and high poverty and unemployment face greater health risks even if their air quality meets federal health standards, according to the article published online in the scientific journal Environmental Health Perspectives.\n\nLos Angeles, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, St. Louis and Fresno are among the metropolitan areas with unhealthful levels of fine particles and large concentrations of poor minorities. More than 50 counties could exceed a new tighter health standard for particulates proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nCommunities of color and those with low education and high poverty and unemployment may face greater health risks even if their air quality meets federal health standards.A pervasive air pollutant, the fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 is a mixture of emissions from diesel engines, power plants, refineries and other sources of combustion. Often called soot, the microscopic particles penetrate deep into the lungs.\n\nThe new study is the first to reveal major racial and economic differences in exposures to specific particle ingredients, some of which are linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and cancer.\n\n\"Numerous studies indicate that some particles are more harmful than others,\" said lead author Michelle Bell, a professor of environmental health at Yale's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.\n\nThe particles people breathe include a variety of metals and chemicals, depending on their source. For instance, people living near refineries are exposed to more nickel and vanadium, while those near coal-fired power plants breathe particles with higher sulfate content. Neighborhoods along busy roads have more nitrates from vehicle exhaust.\n\nOne such community is Boyle Heights, in East Los Angeles. It is more than 90 percent Hispanic and one of the poorest parts of the city.\n\nBoyle Heights is \"surrounded by freeways,\" said Susan Nakamura, planning manager for the region's South Coast Air Quality Management District, \"and a lot of those freeways are used for shipping commercial goods.\" Four major rail yards emit diesel exhaust nearby, and the area is home to \"multiple auto body shops and chrome-platers in close proximity to neighborhoods,\" she said. She is especially concerned about the particulate sources near schools.\n\nA nationwide look\n\nBell and colleague Keita Ebisu examined exposures to 14 components of particulates in 215 Census tracts from 2000-2006. The components, including sulfate, a powerful respiratory irritant, and nickel, a possible carcinogen, were chosen because they had been associated with health impacts or accounted for a substantial amount of particulates overall.\n\nCensus tracts with a greater proportion of Hispanics had significantly higher levels of 11 substances. Included is more than 1.5 times the whites' exposure to nickel, nitrate, silicon, vanadium \u2013 all linked in some studies to hospitalizations or deaths from cardiovascular and lung disease \u2013 and aluminum, which is associated with low birth weights.\n\n3 Comments\n\nWhy was residential wood smoke pollution left out of this study? In the San Francisco Bay Area, it comprises an average of 39% of PM2.5 - in some neighborhoods, it is as high as 80%. Many families scavenge wood to reduce their home heating costs. Residential wood smoke pollution is a serious public health issue. For studies to support this, look at \n\nair pollution is very dangerous to health and it is not only to poor community but also to the public in general because it is transported by air. Therefore it is very hard control it. there are ways such as control at the source of emissions and use different technologies.\n\nHazardous air pollution is not limited to poor neighborhoods. I am a 31 year old while male who lives in a half a million dollar home in Southern California. I live next door to an ornamental flower farmer who sprays pesticides about 30 feet from my bedroom window, several times per week. Sometimes they use a diesel powered tractor blower to spray the insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and fertilizers. Sometimes it is a guy in a hazmat suite, and other times, they use a helicopter. If you do a google search for Mellano Spray you can see the videos I have taken from my bedroom window"}

{"text":"Aerosol samples of PM2.5 and PM10 in a period of intensive haze-fog (HF) events were collected to investigate the chemical characteristics of air pollution in Beijing. The air quality in HF episodes was much worse than that in nonhaze-fog (NHF) days. The concentrations of elements and water-soluble (WS) ions (K+, SO42-, and NO3 -) in HF episodes were more than 10 times higher than those in NHF days. Most of the chemical species in PM2.5 and the secondary species (NH4+, SO42-, and NO3 -) in PM10 showed significant difference between HF from westerly direction (HFW) and southerly direction (HFS). The concentrations of secondary species in HFS were much higher than those in HFW, and other chemical species in HFS were lower than those in HFW. The sources of PM2.5 were more from areas on the regional scale due to its tendency for long-range transport, while PM10 was more limited to the local sources. Aerosol particles were more acidic in HFS and more alkaline in HFW. The secondary species were the major chemical components of the aerosol in HF episodes, and their concentrations increased in the order of NHF < HFW < HFS. High concentrations of the secondary aerosol in HF episodes were likely due to the higher sulfur and nitrogen oxidation rate in aqueous-phase reactions. The serious air pollution in HF episodes was strongly correlated with the meteorological conditions and the emissions of pollutants from anthropogenic sources."}

{"text":"The future for our children at risk from unhealthy environments\nThe WHO response\n\nEnvironmental threats cause up to one third of the global\ndisease burden and 40% of this is estimated to fall on children\nunder the age of 5 years, although they represent only 10% of\nthe global population. More than 5 million child deaths across\nthe world are linked every year to unhealthy environments [1].\n\nIn the WHO European Region, children are at risk of exposure to\nmore than 15,000 synthetic chemicals and to a variety of\nenvironmental hazards, such as indoor and outdoor air pollution,\nroad traffic, effects of global change, contaminated food and\nwater, unsafe buildings, contaminants in toys, radiation and\nenvironmental tobacco smoke. These risks, coexisting in the\nsettings where children live, learn, and play, combine to generate\nor trigger a wide range of negative health effects, including\nasthma, injuries, neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer, and food-\nand waterborne diseases.\n\nAllergy and asthma are particularly important. In most countries\nin the European Region \u2013 from the mid 70s to the mid\n90s \u2013 the prevalence of asthma symptoms in children has\nbeen reported to increase by 200%, although in some parts of the\nregion, such as Italy and Great Britain, the increase may have\nabated. In the European Union countries, allergic disease is the\nmost common chronic illness of childhood and in some areas can be\nestimated to affect more than one child in four. Allergy to pollen\naccounts for 10-20% of allergic disease in Europe. Asthma and\nallergies are associated with several environmental hazards. As\n\"multifactorial\" diseases, they result from complex interaction of\ngenes and the environment, in particular tobacco smoke, poor\nindoor\/outdoor air, and environmental allergens influence [2].\n\nAmong the many factors associated with asthma and allergies, the\nenvironmental consequences of climate change have recently\nattracted the attention of scientists and the public health\ncommunity [3]. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns\nmay alter the length and timing of the growing season of allergens'\nproducing plants. On average, the length of the growing season in\nEurope has increased by 10-11 days during the last\n30 years, due to an advanced start of flowering of some\nspecies. Longer and more intense exposure to pollen can increase\nthe number of allergic episodes and raise the demand for health\ncare and general practitioners' consultations.\n\nOn this ground, in recognition of the special vulnerability of\nchildren, European ministers at the Third Ministerial Conference on\nEnvironment and Health, London 1999, committed themselves to\ndevelop policies and actions to achieve a safe environment in which\nchildren can develop their highest attainable level of health. They\nendorsed the WHO European programme on children's health and\nenvironment to address environmental threats to children's health\nand assess the potential health risks of emerging problems.\n\nThe next WHO Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health to\nbe held in Budapest in June 2004 will specifically address the\neffects on children's health of environmental exposures. Its\noverall theme is \"The future for our children\". An appropriate\ninternational instrument, the Children's Environment and Health\nAction Plan for Europe (CEHAPE), is being developed with the aim of\nputting children's health at the top of the political agenda for\nenvironment and health. The plan sets out measures aimed at various\nsectors to decrease environmental exposures and to give priority to\npreventing asthma, allergies and respiratory health as well as\nneurodevelopmental disorders and birth defects, water- and\nfood-related diseases, and injuries.\n\nBeing evidence-based for the European Region as a whole, the\nCEHAPE will provide a framework on which Member States can develop\ntheir national plans and policies, by adapting it to their various\nneeds. It will contain tools for monitoring and implementation, a\ncore and an extended set of indicators, and case studies, including\nexamples of good practice and ways to increase access to\nenvironmental health information and education.\n\nThere are still many scientific uncertainties surrounding the\nhealth effects of environmental hazards on children, but a lot is\nknown and it is possible to act on this knowledge now at the\ninternational, national and local levels. We are confident that\nthis objective is shared by policy makers and the public health\ncommunity. Children's health and the environment lie at the centre\nof sustainable development: putting children's health at the centre\nof the public health agenda will protect them to-day and ensure\nbetter health to the adults of tomorrow."}

{"text":"Air quality issues: Ventilation and humidity control\n\nAugust 11, 2012\n\nBEECH CREEK - Indoor air quality decreases as less outside air is introduced into the home,\" said the owner Redmonds Complete Comfort, LLC, in Beech Creek.\n\n\"Because of the improved techniques in sealing homes for energy management purposes, ventilation is becoming an extremely important component in indoor air quality,\" said Brian Redmond. \"Tighter homes resulting in less air movement generally means indoor air quality suffers.\n\n\"If too little outdoor air enters a home, pollutants can sometimes accumulate to levels that can pose health and comfort problems,\" he continued. \"One successful approach to lowering the concentration of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming in. Outdoor air enters and leaves a house by infiltration, natural ventilation and mechanical ventilation.\"\n\nr Infiltration - A process where outdoor air flows into the house through openings, joints, and cracks in walls, floors, and ceilings, and around windows and doors.\n\nr Natural ventilation - When air moves through open windows and doors.\n\nr Mechanical ventilation - Devices, from exhaust fans (vented outdoors) that intermittently remove air from a single room, such as bathrooms and kitchens, to air handling systems that use fans and duct work to continuously remove indoor air and distribute filtered and conditioned outdoor air to strategic points throughout the house.\n\nAccording to Redmond, the most effective method of controlling air quality is through mechanical ventilation. It allows you to introduce fresh air and remove a good share of air pollutants when the air is exchanged. To determine if you have any indoor air quality issues, ask yourself the following questions. Do you have:\n\nr Excess dust\n\nr Stuffy rooms\n\nr Moisture on window panes or sweaty pipes\n\nr Musty odors\n\nr Family members that often sneeze, feel lethargic, or have dry skin (pollutants can sometimes accumulate to levels that can pose health and comfort problems).\n\nIn addition to ventilating, controlling the humidity level in your home is a significant factor in air quality and comfort in general. In fact, industry experts state that keeping your home's humidity between 30 and 60 percent can reduce the effects of many unwanted conditions. To determine if you might have an air quality issue as it relates to humidity, review the following symptoms often caused by less than optimum humidity levels."}

{"text":"The State of the Air report has been put together by the American Lung Association for the past 13 years. The 2012 report looked at the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 at various monitored sites across the United States.\n\nThe 2012 report recorded that 41 percent of the population still live in areas with pollution levels too dangerous to breathe. This is a staggering number, but it is an improvement from the previous year's report. Since 1990 our air has gotten cleaner even with an increase in population, economy, energy use and miles driven.\n\nThe report records three separate measures. The measures taken are of the ozone pollution, the averaged year round particle pollution and the short-term levels of particle pollution. As of 2010 the ozone was recorded as 13 percent lower, the year round particle pollution was 24 percent lower and the short-term particle pollution decreased by 28 percent.\n\nWith all of these significant decreases it is a wonder why levels are still considered so dangerous. As a society we are still attempting to correct our mistakes that brought us to these circumstances. While things are improving, they are doing so at a glacial pace. It may take no time at all to wreak havoc on our air, but correcting those damages can take significant more time.\n\nOut of the 25 cities recorded last year with the most ozone pollution, 22 of them improved their air quality. Over 50 percent of theUnited States' most smog polluted cities had their best year yet, but the levels still remain dangerous. For the first time in the reports 13 year history though,DetroitandNew York Cityare not ranked among the most polluted cities. While our metropolises take action, our smaller cities have seemed to falter.\n\nThe report calculated that over 5.7 million people live in counties where the outdoor air failed all three tests. The American Lung Association believes that the number is probably due to the fact that Congress has not adjusted levels of safety in many years.\n\nA total of 38.5 percent of our population currently lives in areas with unhealthful levels of ozone pollution. This places individuals at risk for decreased lung function, respiratory infection, lung inflammation and aggravation of former respiratory illnesses. That leaves a large part of our population at extreme health risks.\n\nThe report also recorded that 16.1 percent of the population lives in areas with unhealthful short-term levels of particle pollution. These levels can last anywhere from several hours to days. These levels have the potential to increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and emergency room visits for asthma and cardiovascular disease. It can also increase the risk of early death.\n\nChronic levels of particle pollution often lead to regular threats to individual health. Today, 6.4 million people live in counties that experience these high levels.\n\nBelow are the top five rankings in the three categories studied along with the cleanest cities and counties for year-round particle pollution:\n\nPeople at Risk in 25 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Short-term Particle Pollution\n\nBakersfield\u2013Delano, CA\n\nFresno-Modera, CA\n\nHanford-Corcoran, CA\n\nLos Angeles-Long Beach-Riverside, CA\n\nModesto, CA\n\nPeople at Risk in 25 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Year-round Particle Pollution\n\nWith the beginning of May comes not only the first hint of summer, but also the St. Louis Regional Clean Air Partnership's (SLRCAP) air quality index (AQI). But, what does this actually mean for motorists?\n\nThe AQI converts measured pollutant concentration in a community's air to a number on a scale of 0 to 500. In St. Louis those numbers are converted into colored days. Green signifies a good day for air quality. Usually cool summer temperatures and either wind or clouds are associated with this day. As the summer gets hotter and the days get longer the air quality decreases. A yellow day means moderate air quality. Temperatures range from the mid 70s and up and are accompanied by light winds and sunny skies. Days that land in the orange and red are much more apparent to the naked eye. These days are usually extremely hot and hazy. As a motorist if you see heat waves reflecting off of the pavement you know that the AQI is likely to be high.\n\nIn the month of May last year the AQI only reached yellow five times. This year the index marked at yellow by the fourth of the month.\n\nAir Quality Facts\n\nThe ozone is created when heat and sunlight react with hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides emitted from automobiles, body shops, gas stations, organic solvents and various other sources. When these elements are mixed together they form the ground level layer of ozone known as smog. One thing to note is that good and bad ozone are chemically identical but it is their location in the atmosphere that creates the difference.\n\nTransportation and Ozone Facts\n\nIn 2009, 81 percent of Missouri residents drove to work alone on a daily basis\n\nThe average travel time to work in Missouri was 23.2 minutes in 2009\n\nIn 2010, over 1.3 million St. Louis residents drove to and from work during peak travel time\n\nSt. Louis residents make 7.2 million vehicle trips per day with 5.3 million of those being single person trips\n\nIn 2008, St. Louis residents drove over 71 miles per day\n\nIn 2010, St. Louis motorists spent an individual average of 30 hours in traffic, costing peak commuters $642 annually and wasting 14 gallons of fuel\n\nOne person utilizing van\/carpool services can save 225 pounds of harmful emissions per year - this equates to about $3,500 per year\n\nOne highway lane can accommodate 2,250 people per hour in cars and 9,000 peope per hour in buses\n\nTwo metro tracks have the same capacity as 16 lanes of highway\n\nA full MetroBus can remove 40 cars and a full MetroLink can remove 125 cars from the highways\n\nTips to Keep our AQI Green\n\nKeep your tires properly inflated.

They said China has only recently begun to monitor ozone , and it's become the world's largest emitter of mercury, carbon dioxide and other pollutants.\n\nIn the 1980s, they said China's particulate-matter concentrations were at least 10 to 16 times higher than the World Health Organization's annual guidelines. Even after major improvements, by 2005, they said the concentrations were still five times higher than what is considered safe and led to 656,000 premature deaths in China each year.\n\nChina is taking steps to mitigate air pollution, in partly by boosting its support for renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Its hefty subsidies to its solar industry have prompted some U.S. manufacturers to file a complaint with the International Trade Commission. In January, the nation set a target to reduce its 2010 levels of carbon intensity (the amount of carbon emitted per unit of gross domestic product) 17% by 2015."}
{"text":"Toxic air pollutants (also known as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs)), are chemical compounds that are known or suspected carcinogens and or mutagens. Emission of toxic pollutants into the ambient air present a serious threat to public health and the environment. Prolonged exposure to air toxics pollutants at ample ambient air concentrations can result in cancer, as well as immunological, neurological, respiratory and reproductive problems. Deposition of air toxics into the soil, lakes and streams affect the ecological systems and eventually human health due to consumption of contaminated food. Accidental releases of air toxics into the ambient air and in substantially potent quantities can be an immediate threat to human health.\n\nToxic air pollutants may consist of particulate matter, gases absorbed into particles (diesel emissions, metals , etc.), and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC's) vapors from fuels. Toxic air pollutants are emitted by natural events (forest fires, volcanoes) as well as from industrial and mobile sources. Many household items are also major contributors to air toxics in the ambient air, including paints, cleaning products, pesticides and plastic foam products.\n\nSumma Canister\n\nMany toxic compounds have well established carcinogenic thresholds, and are regulated by industry specific standards promulgated under the Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) of 1990.\n\nHowever, these standards only apply to large industrial sources and do not address the vast number of small industry sources and mobile sources which also contribute substantially to air toxic emissions.\n\nThe reduction of air toxic emissions and the associated risks from all emission sources is the focus of Broward County's Urban Air Toxics Strategy.\n\nBroward County's Pollution Prevention, Remediation & Air Quality Division collects and analyzes ambient air concentrations for hazardous air pollutants weekly in predesignated sites. These monitoring sites were selected after examining predicted high density population areas, high concentrations of industrial enterprises and overlapping high volume traffic activity. Specific toxic pollutants are collected by allowing ambient air to be \"drawn\" into a \"Summa\u00ae\" canister, at a continuous flow rate for 24 hours. Upon completion of each sampling period, each canister is turned off, tightly capped, and returned to the Broward County DPEP Air Toxics Laboratory for analysis.\n\nCounty Air Toxics Specialist\n\nAnalysis is preformed in batches using a Gas Chromatography\/Mass Spectrometry (GC\/MS) system.

{"text":"Tracking air quality and pollution\n\nGovernment agencies measure the amount of pollutants in the air and offer air quality reports and forecasts. It's important for everyone, especially people with lung diseases, to keep track of current air quality levels in their area. If you know pollution levels are high (air quality is bad) you can take steps to protect your breathing.\n\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) and the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI)\n\nEnvironment Canada reports on air quality (air pollution levels) using rating scales. These rating scales keep track of what pollutants are affecting an area, and how much of them there are. The rating scales are usually updated several times a week.\n\nEnvironment Canada now has two ways of measuring smog: the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI).\n\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) measures the level of six major air pollutants and gives a reading based on the pollutant that's at the worst level that day. For example, one day there might be a little ground-level ozone, a little carbon dioxide and a lot of fine particular matter. The Air Quality Index reading for that day would be based only on the level of fine particular matter, because fine particulate matter is the biggest pollutant that day.\n\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) scale ranges from 0 to 100. The lower the AQI number, the better the air quality. For example, if the air quality index is at 25 or less, the air quality is considered good. If the air quality index is 51 to 100, it's considered poor air quality.\n\nThe Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is a new rating system that helps you understand what the air quality around you means to your health.\n\nThe Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) doesn't just measure one pollutant at a time. Instead, it looks at the levels of a combination of common air pollutants. The Air Quality Health Index takes into account that exposure to many pollutants, even at low levels, can add up and damage your health. For example, on a day that had low levels of three kinds of pollutants, the Air Quality Health Index would take into account all three pollutants and give a reading that reflects all three. The Air Quality Health Index also offers information on how to adjust your daily activities so you're less likely to be harmed by smog.\n\nThe Air Quality Health Index has a scale that goes from 1 (low health risk) to 10 or more (very high health risk). For example, for people most at risk (seniors, children, those with breathing problems), even a low-to-moderate AQHI number may mean that they have to reduce or reschedule activities. For the general population, a high AQHI reading means they should postpone their strenuous outdoor activities until later or do less strenuous activity if they notice any symptoms from smog (coughing, throat irritation).\n\nHow to keep track of the air quality in your area\n\nAlthough \"smog season\" is usually April to September, smog can happen at any time in the year. Make it habit to check the air quality index in your area every day. If you know in advance that the air quality will be bad, you can plan your day around it.\n\nThere are many places you can find air quality reports and smog forecasts:\n\nThe Weather Network, a for-profit website, offers air quality reports for all provinces except Saskatchewan. This site offers a free service that sends you daily alerts about local air quality.\n\nYour local daily newspaper, television and radio stations usually offer air quality information in their weather forecasts. Public health units may offer smog advisories on days when the air quality index levels are high.\n\nGovernment tracking of the sources of pollution (point sources)\n\nMany industrial, commercial and other stationary sources produce emissions that create outdoor air pollution. The following government programs keep track of emissions from many industries and sectors:"}

We depend on clean air for our well-being and there is no doubt that air pollution causes a range of health effects from minor symptoms such as headaches, sore throats and coughs to more serious problems such as difficulty in breathing and aggravation of respiratory conditions.\n\nEveryday activities have the potential to pollute the air such as fumes from road traffic, fuel-burning heating devices and industrial emissions.\n\nLocal air quality management\n\nThe Environment Act 1995 places a duty on local authorities to manage air quality in their area and work towards meeting national objectives. The National Air Quality Strategy sets standards for the eight main air pollutants and objectives for the UK. If investigations indicate objectives are being exceeded, an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) must be declared covering the affected area. Action plans must then be drawn up setting out how further objectives are to be achieved.\n\nAir quality in Newark and Sherwood\n\nWe review and assess local air quality on an annual basis and submit a report of our findings to the Government. Each year the report progressively updates the information since the last submission by considering new monitoring data for the area, new sources of emissions to air and changes to existing sources that may be significant to local air quality.\n\nDuring 2011 our report indicated that within the district all relevant air quality objectives were likely to be met at all locations.

{"text":"The Science of Making Belmont Safe\n\nRIVERSIDE COUNTY \u2014 Under a hot, humid March sky, down the road from a cow shed, another subdivision is on the rise at the end of a featureless cul-de-sac. But there's one complication. These four houses under construction are located atop ground that contains methane gas \u2014 a natural byproduct of decaying biomass, in this case, cow manure from a dairy. Methane disperses harmlessly in open areas, but it can accumulate to explosive concentrations in enclosed spaces. Unless something is done, methane could eventually collect in these homes and become a fire hazard. Light a match in a room full of methane \u2014 and poof.\n\nA similar challenge confronts the Los Angeles Unified School District at the half-finished Belmont Learning Complex. Belmont, like these houses and like thousands of other Southern California properties, sits on property that emits methane gas. At Belmont, the gas comes from the oil field below, a common situation in Los Angeles. But methane also is a problem for contractors building on wetlands, land that used to be swampy or former agricultural sites, especially dairies.\n\nFonseca and two coworkers have dug a series of trenches and lined them with a synthetic, woven fabric. The trenches snake under where the living room, the bathroom and the garage will be.\n\nPlastic pipes slotted with vents trace the same path, inside the trenches. These pipes connect to a vertical joint that will soon lead an exhaust pipe above roof level. Gravel from a backhoe is then shoveled in by the workers. At this point the system more resembles a taco than a burrito. But then the ends of the synthetic fabric are folded over, and fastened together with duct tape. There's your methane burrito.\n\nMethane, which is lighter than air, follows the path of least resistance. So before it can find a crack in the floor slab, it will encounter the open vents in the pipes and begin its journey to the atmosphere.\n\nDay and night cyclical variations in barometric pressure, says GeoKenetics principal engineer Glenn Tofani, will ensure that methane is drawn out and fresh air brought back into the pipes. This \"passive\" way of evacuating methane is by far the most common method. But it can be made \"active\" by installing a suction fan.\n\nBut there's more. A week later, Tofani is on site to supervise as workers spray on \u2014 over the filled-in trenches \u2014 a membrane called Liquid Boot, which dries quickly to a thin white coating. The job of the Liquid Boot is to act as a barrier keeping methane from the house. If all works as planned, the Liquid Boot coating will, in effect, route the methane toward the vented pipes.\n\nFor this job, Tofani has decided to add another barrier too \u2014 a layer of plastic called high-density polyethelyne.\n\nInstalling safety systems to protect against methane has become a cottage industry in Los Angeles in the wake of a 1985 methane explosion that injured about two dozen people in the Fairfax District. The technology was originally developed for the petroleum industry and landfills, which can emit methane and other gases. Barrier-and-venting systems are underneath, among thousands of places, just about everything new built in the Fairfax District as well as L.A.'s Central Library, a Wells Fargo bank on Beverly Boulevard, housing tracts in Orange County and a Marriott hotel in El Segundo. Whole hillside developments in Brea are planned on former oil fields.\n\nAt Belmont, there's an additional challenge. The ground also contains spot concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic. Though not as pervasive as methane, hydrogen sulfide too can be found in parts of the L.A. basin that are fully developed with homes, schools and businesses. It can be dealt with through machinery that separates hydrogen sulfide from methane, so that the hydrogen sulfide can be collected in a tank.\n\nSuch a system is in place in Newport Beach at Hoag Hospital, which has higher concentrations of underground hydrogen sulfide than the Belmont site. Hoag uses its \"cleaned\" methane to heat the building.\n\nThe safety system at Hoag incorporates a network of wells and trench collectors that pump soil gases to a central unit, where air scrubbers remove the toxic hydrogen sulfide. The hospital also has backup measures: A pipe-and-barrier system underneath the building slab serves as extra guard against gas leaking through the building's foundation. Inside the hospital, there are air pumps that pull in fresh air at a rate faster than the gas can come through the foundation \u2014 should gas sensors detect seeping methane.\n\nA similar layering of fail-safe systems would most likely be the plan at Belmont. For instance, contractors could install a plastic lining under the buildings, and below this, a venting system to pull out soil gases. Hydrogen sulfide could be collected in a tank, as at Hoag. Methane alarms could be installed below the barrier, above the barrier, or both, as could an alarm signaling a malfunction in the venting system. The setup sounds complex to a layman, but it's relatively simple, established technology, according to engineers interviewed by the Weekly."}

{"text":"Section 112 of the Clean Air Act identifies 188 compounds emitted from stationary, area, and\nmobile sources as hazardous air pollutants (also known as \"air toxics\"). The EPA has\nclassified many of these substances as \"known,\" \"probable,\" or\n\"possible\" human carcinogens. Air toxics are associated with a wide variety of\nnoncancer adverse health effects that include neurological, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, and\nrespiratory effects as well as effects on the immune and reproductive systems. The seriousness of\nthe harm can range from headaches and nausea to respiratory arrest and death. Severity varies with\nthe amount and length of exposure, the nature of the chemical itself (e.g., how it interacts with\nvarious organs and organ systems), and the unique behaviors and sensitivities of individual people.\nSome chemicals pose particular hazards to people of certain ages or genetic backgrounds.\n\n2. How did EPA characterize risk from the modeled 1999 exposure estimates?\n\nTo evaluate a chemical's potential to cause cancer and other adverse health\neffects, EPA examines which adverse effects a particular substance causes (in a \"hazard\nidentification\"), determines the exposure to the population (in an \"exposure\nassessment\"), and evaluates the specific exposures at which these effects might occur\n(in a \"dose-response assessment\"). The evaluation is based on studies of humans,\nanimals, and microorganisms, usually published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. In this\nnational-scale assessment, EPA combined information from dose-response assessments with modeled\nexposure estimates in a \"risk characterization\" to describe the potential that real-\nworld exposures to air toxics compounds might cause harm. The EPA also examined the uncertainties\nsurrounding the characterization of risk.\n\nAt present, EPA typically assumes a linear relationship between the level of\nexposure and the lifetime probability of cancer from an air toxics compound. It expresses this\ndose-response relationship for cancer in terms of a unit\nrisk estimate. The unit risk estimate (URE) is an upper\nbound estimate of an individual's probability of contracting cancer over a lifetime of exposure\nto a concentration of one microgram of the pollutant per cubic meter of air. Risks from exposures\nto concentrations other than one microgram per cubic meter are usually calculated by multiplying\nthe actual concentration to which someone is exposed by the URE. For example, the EPA may determine\nthe URE of a particular air toxics compound to be one in ten thousand per microgram per cubic meter.\nThis means that a person who inhales air containing an average of one microgram per cubic meter for\n70 years would have (as an upper bound) one chance in ten thousand (or 0.01%) of contracting cancer\nas a result. The EPA has developed UREs for many substances, and continues to re-examine and update\nthem as knowledge improves. More information on UREs can be found in the EPA's\nIntegrated Risk Information System. The UREs used in this\nassessment, along with associated uncertainties and a summary of the EPA's risk assessment\nguidelines for carcinogens, are included in the Health Effects Criteria\ndiscussion.\n\n4. How were the cancer risk estimates affected by EPA's recently revised Guidelines for Carcinogen\nRisk Assessment (EPA\/630\/P-03\/001F) and new Supplemental Guidance for Assessing Susceptibility from\nEarly-Life Exposure to Carcinogens (EPA\/630\/R-03\/003F)?\n\nThe revised Guidelines were released after the risk calculations for the national-scale\nassessment were completed. However, the effective guidance at the time we calculated the risks\n(an earlier draft of the revised Guidelines) was consistent in most ways with the revised document.\nThere was one important exception to this consistency, however. The cancer guidelines now include\nSupplemental Guidance that makes new recommendations with regard to estimating cancer risks to\nchildren. These recommendations have not been implemented for the chemicals included in the\nnational-scale assessment, with the exception of vinyl chloride.\n\nThe Supplemental Guidance recommends that risks to children be adjusted for carcinogenic\nchemicals acting through a mutagenic and linear mode of action (i.e., chemicals that cause cancer\nby damaging genes). Where available data for the chemical are adequate they should be used to\ndevelop age-specific potency values, as EPA has already done for vinyl chloride (and which are\nalready reflected for that chemical in the national-scale assessment). Where available data do\nnot support a chemical-specific evaluation of differences between adults and children, the\nSupplemental Guidance recommends the use of the following default adjustment factors for early-\nlife exposures: increase the carcinogenic potency by 10-fold for children up to 2 years old, and\n3-fold for children from 2 to 15 years old. These adjustments have the aggregate effect of\nincreasing by about 60% the estimated risk for a 70-year (lifetime) constant inhalation exposure.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that EPA recommends that the default adjustments be made only\nfor carcinogens (1) acting through a mutagenic mode of action, (2) for which a linear dose response\nhas been assigned, and (3) for which data to evaluate adult and juvenile differences are not\navailable. The default adjustments are not recommended for carcinogens whose mode of action is\nunknown. EPA will determine as part of the IRIS assessment process which substances meet these\ncriteria, and future national-scale assessments will reflect adjustments for those substances.\n\nThe process of developing the unit risk estimate (URE) includes several important sources of uncertainty.\n\nFirst, many of the air toxics compounds in this assessment were classified as probable carcinogens, which means that data were not sufficient to prove these substances definitely cause cancer in humans. It is possible that some are not human carcinogens at environmentally relevant doses, and that the true cancer risk associated with these air toxics is zero.\n\nSecond, all UREs used in this assessment were based on linear extrapolation from high to low exposures. To the extent that true dose-response relationships for some air toxics compounds are less than linear, this assumption may result in overestimates of cancer risk.\n\nThird, UREs for most of these substances were developed from animal data using conservative methods to extrapolate between species. Actual human responses may differ from the predicted ones.\n\nFourth, most UREs used in this assessment (benzene is a notable exception to this) were based on statistical procedures that give the upper bound on the URE, which will likely result in an overstatement of risk.\n\nOn balance, we believe that true cancer risk from the assessed air toxics compounds would probably be less than that calculated in this assessment, although the possibility remains that it could be greater.\n\n6. Does EPA distinguish among chemicals based on the type of data that supports\nits carcinogenic potential?\n\nThe EPA uses a system called the weight-of-evidence for carcinogenicity for characterizing the\nextent to which available data support the hypothesis that a compound causes cancer in humans.\nUnder the EPA's 1986 risk assessment guidelines, the weight-of-evidence was described by Groups\n(A through E). Group A contains \"known\" carcinogens, or compounds for which evidence\nis sufficient to demonstrate a causal relationship between exposure and cancer incidence in humans.\nGroup B contains \"probable\" carcinogens, for which evidence of cancer in humans is\nsuggestive (Group B1) or evidence of cancer in animals is conclusive (Group B2). Group C\ncontains \"possible\" carcinogens, for which animal evidence is suggestive but not\nconclusive. Group D contains agents for which no evidence exists (so it cannot be said whether\nthe compound is or is not a carcinogen). Group E contains compounds for which adequate negative\nevidence exists (so it can be said that the compound is not a carcinogen). The approach outlined\nin the EPA's proposed guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment (1999) considers all scientific\ninformation in determining whether and under what conditions an agent may cause cancer in humans,\nand provides a narrative approach to characterizing carcinogenicity (rather than using categories\nor groups).\n\nBecause risk estimates are probabilities, cancer risks associated with different substances can\nbe added together as long as the substances cause cancer by (1) similar mechanisms, or (2)\ncompletely independent mechanisms. Addition of cancer risk estimates is inappropriate only where\nsubstances interact in ways that either enhance or inhibit each other's carcinogenic potency.\nHad it been available, information on non-additive interactions would have been considered (as\nrecommended in the EPA's 1986 Guidelines for the Health Risk Assessment of Chemical Mixtures,\n52 FR 34014-34025). Because no such information was identified, the EPA used the guidelines'\ndefault assumption that cancer risks from different air toxics compounds may be added.\n\nThe EPA typically expresses dose-response relationships for effects other than cancer in terms\nof the inhalation reference concentration (RfC).\nThe RfC is a concentration of the compound in air thought to be without adverse effects even if a\nperson is exposed continuously. In other words, exposures below the RfC will probably not cause\nadverse noncancer health effects.\n\nTo express noncancer hazards the EPA uses the RfC as part of a calculation called the\nhazard quotient (HQ), which is the\nratio between the concentration to which a person is exposed and the RfC. A value of the HQ less\nthan one indicates that the exposure is lower than the RfC and that no adverse health effects would\nbe expected. A value of the HQ greater than one indicates that the exposure is higher than the\nRfC. However, because many RfCs incorporate protective assumptions in the face of uncertainty, an\nHQ greater than one does not necessarily suggest a likelihood of adverse effects. Furthermore,\nthe HQ cannot be translated to a probability that adverse effects will occur and is not likely to\nbe proportional to risk. An HQ greater than one can best be described as indicating that a\npotential exists for adverse health effects.\n\nThe EPA has developed RfCs for many substances, and continues to re-examine and update them as\nknowledge improves. More information on RfCs can be found in the EPA's\nIntegrated Risk Information System. The RfCs (and\nequivalent values) used in this assessment, along with associated uncertainties and a summary of\nthe EPA's risk assessment guidelines for effects other than cancer, are included on the\nHealth Effects Criteria page.\n\n9. Can noncancer hazard estimates for different substances be combined?\n\nBecause different pollutants may cause similar adverse health effects, it is often appropriate\nto combine hazard quotients associated with different substances. The EPA has drafted revisions\nto the national guidelines on mixtures that support combining the effects of different substances\nin specific and limited ways. Ideally, hazard quotients should be combined for pollutants that\ncause adverse effects by the same toxic mechanism. However, because detailed information on toxic\nmechanisms was not available for most of the substances in this assessment, the EPA used a simpler\nand more conservative method also outlined in these draft guidelines. The combined noncancer\nhazards associated with respiratory irritation caused by 41 pollutants and neurological effects\nassociated with 20 pollutants were calculated using the hazard\nindex (HI), defined as the sum of hazard quotients for individual air toxics compounds that\naffect the same organ or organ system. The HI is only an approximation of the\ncombined effect because some of the substances may affect the target organs in different\n(i.e., non-additive) ways. As with the HQ, a value of the HI below 1.0 will likely not result in\nadverse effects over a lifetime of exposure. However, a value of the HI greater than\n1.0 does not necessarily suggest a likelihood of adverse effects. Furthermore, the HI cannot be\ntranslated to a probability that adverse effects will occur and is not likely to be\nproportional to risk. An HI greater than one can be best described as indicating that a potential\nmay exist for adverse effects to respiratory or nervous system."}

But a large number of other sources\u2014like cars, or oil and gas activities\u2014can add up to big contributions too. There are also natural sources of haze, like forest fires or dust storms. However, the law only deals with the haze caused by humans.\n\nThe pollution from these sources comes together and creates small particles in the atmosphere.

The database shows Jefferson County cancer rates for men and women are about the same as the state average, with Orange County about 10 to 15 percent higher.\n\nHe noted that the data is not a perfect representation of the local situation because people can develop cancer in one city or region and be diagnosed and treated in other places.\n\nWhile state environmental officials say Southeast Texas air quality has improved substantially in the past 10 years, Birdwell said it will take many years to see a subsequent drop in cancer rates, as the disease can take years of exposure to toxins to develop.\n\n\"If (the toxins) are cleaned up, it could take another 10 to 20 years to see a drop,\" Birdwell said.\n\nBirdwell said while he is not a pollution expert, anecdotal evidence indicates improvement.\n\n\"I talk to people that grew up in South Park years ago and said the backyards would be black with pollution,\" he said. \"I think it's certainly better than it used to be.\"\n\nChemical brew in downtown Beaumont air a danger, based on complete 2002 stats...."}

{"text":"Ozone is a big buzz word these days. We mostly hear about the ozone layer, and the importance of protecting it. But if you want to understand what ozone's all about, you need to understand that it can be good, and it can be bad.\n\nThe stratosphere is the layer of the atmosphere from 10 to 30 miles above sea level. When there's ozone in this layer, it protects us from solar radiation. How? Simple chemistry.\n\nRegular oxygen molecules, known to science-types as O2, are made up of two oxygen atoms stuck together. Solar energy shoots in from space and splits that molecule into two atoms. When one of those stray atoms attaches to a full-fledged O2 molecule, you've got, well, O3, otherwise known as ozone. All that action blocks solar radiation, and keeps it from reaching us.\n\nImage above: The second largest ozone hole ever observed is seen above Antarctica in this image from September 2003. Credit: NASA\n\nHow can solar radiation be harmful to life on Earth? Part of that radiation is ultra-violet, or UV radiation. It's an intense energy from the Sun that can cause a whole lot of damage. Skin cancer is the most dramatic result of a too much UV radiation, but there's a lot more too. Photosynthesis in plants is also affected, and that causes problems for the whole food chain. See where this is headed? We need to protect our ozone shield, and we can do so by decreasing the pollution that our industrial society puts out in large amounts every day.\n\nLet's come down a little closer to Earth. The troposphere is everything below the stratosphere, from sea level to about 10 miles above. It's where everything lives. Things that happen to the troposphere happen to us; there's nothing indirect about it.\n\nPut a little ozone in the troposphere and you've got some big problems. Remember those dramatic chemical reactions that happened up in the stratosphere? Living things are made of atoms and molecules too, so when we expose them to ozone, we've got some serious chemical reactions on our hands.\n\nImage above: Parts of the Los Angeles area are considered to contain unhealthy amounts of ground level ozone. Red areas on the map indicate more than 100 parts per billion by volume of the molecule. Credit: EPA\n\nIn humans, it means lung damage. Small children and people with asthma are especially at risk. How can you help solve the problem?\n\nCars, trucks and SUVs are the biggest contributor to this ozone buildup. Engine exhaust creates nitrogen dioxide, so the more you drive, the more your vehicle creates. High gas prices aren't the only reason to leave the car in the garage.\n\nThe launch of Aura will culminate a 15-year international effort to establish the world's most comprehensive Earth Observing System, which aims to determine the extent, causes, and regional consequences of global change.\n\nNASA's Aura is going to keep tabs on both types of ozone. It's a spacecraft that will provide us the first comprehensive global view of the Earth's atmosphere, an essential stepping stone to better understanding the Moon, Mars and beyond. The launch of Aura is a challenging endeavor, a mission on the cutting edge of scientific discovery characteristic of the Agency's legacy of ground-breaking exploration.\n\nOne of its most impressive tools is the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, or OMI. The device will measure the amount of energy going into and coming out of the Earth, in a technique known as the \"backscatter\" method. The results of these observations will tell scientists how much ozone is over a particular area, and how much the area is gaining or losing over time.\n\nAura is a complex mission for a complex problem; but simply put, it's critical to understanding and protecting the air we breathe."}

This presumably has been in\nbalance for millions of years and explains the uv ozone protection in\nthe upper atmosphere.\n\nOzone is formed in the\nstratosphere by free radical reactions.\n\n'ordinary' stable\noxygen\nO2 (dioxygen) is split (dissociates) into two\nby high energy ultraviolet radiation (uv photon energy\n'wave packets) into two oxygen atoms (which are themselves\nradicals) and then a 'free' oxygen atom combines with an oxygen\nmolecule to form ozone (trioxygen).\n\nO2 +\nuv ==>\n2O. then O.\n+ O2==> O3\n\nThe ozone is a highly\nreactive and unstable molecule and decomposes into dioxygen when hit\nby other uv light photons.

Yet another serious concern where it comes to wanting to breathe clean air for better health!\n\ntraffic pollution\n\nIt is known that traffic air pollution raises one's risk for cardiovascular disease. But now it may also increase a woman's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. German researchers have found a possible connection in their studies.\n\nPublished in Environmental Health Perspectives, appearing online prior to the printed edition, their study of German women living in very polluted industrial areas versus those in rural areas with less pollution. Researchers analyzed data from 1,775 women between 54 or 55 years old as they began the study in 1985. By 1990 through 2006, 187 women were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. This disease is most often known to start in middle age. The air pollution data was gathered from local environmental agencies to gage women's pollution exposure amounts.\n\nNow more than ever it seems we must encourage the fight for clean air. For not only women's health, but for everyone. This latest study simply shows that there are more possible risks than the ones we are currently aware of. Leading us to consider that there may be even more risks to worry about \u2013 ones that we just haven't discovered yet. A frightening thought indeed! It's time we all breathed cleaner air and enjoyed a great quality of life.\n\nAn exposure to traffic pollution components, especially nitrogen dioxide and soot in ambient fine particulate matter seemed to offer a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.

Even if you do it a few times a week, it will help to save gas.\n\nGroup errands by location. Doing this means you won't run all over your city or county trying to get everything done. You'll save on gas and you'll save time. It's a win-win deal all around!\n\nPractice walking or biking for shorter errands or chores. There are some things you use your car for that you could probably walk or bike for. Going to the store for milk or picking up a copy of the newspaper.

{"text":"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has officially designated January 2012 to be National Radon Action Month.\n\nRadon is a naturally-occurring, radioactive gas that seeps out of the ground and can enter homes and other buildings. Since radon is invisible and odorless, the only way to know if a home has dangerous levels of the gas is to conduct a radon test. Radon problems have been found in every county in the United States so the Surgeon General is recommending that all homes be tested.\n\nRadon causes more deaths each year in the United States than any other in-home hazard including fires and carbon monoxide deaths combined, according to the EPA.\n\nThe EPA estimates that as many as eight million homes in the United States currently have dangerous levels of radon gas. They also predict that if action is not taken to correct this problem, between 15,000 and 22,000 deaths will occur in 2012 from exposure to the gas.\n\nFurther, EPA estimates that radon is responsible for more than 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. after smoking and the leading cause of lung cancer among non-smokers. Since radon does not have an odor and is invisible, people tend to downplay the health effects and ignore the possibility that there might be a silent killer within the walls of their home, according to health officials.\n\n\"I would want people to understand that this is not something to panic about,\" said Mike Lunsford , Radon Specialist at the Division of Health Service Regulation - Radiation Protection Section. \"It's perfectly natural, it comes out of the ground. It's not a pollutant we can blame on anybody except Mother Nature. There is no physical way to detect it, and radon doesn't have any short-term affects.\"\n\nThe NC Radon Program urges residents to take action this month by testing their homes for radon.\n\nBy visiting ncradon.org, you can learn more about how to obtain a do-it-yourself test kit, which Lunsford said is easy to use. After learning how much radon is in your home, you may need to \"channel the soil gas outside, as opposed to into your home,\" said Lunsford.\n\nThere is a potential for some homes in this county to have elevated levels of radon, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Houses in the same neighborhood can have very different levels, so every home should be tested.\n\nTesting homes for radon is simple and inexpensive. Radon test kits can be purchased at local hardware and home improvement stores, directly from radon testing companies, or are available for free during January from the NC Radon Program. Should your home be found to have elevated levels of radon, the problem can be fixed by qualified contractors for a cost similar to that of many other home repairs.

Any time a highway is expanded in an urban area where there are more than 150,000 vehicles a day, the studies show that we must consider health risks. The following studies have been compiled by The Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago.\n\n1) Traffic Increased Cancer-Causing Pollution Levels at Tollbooth\nThis study published in the Journal of Air & Waste Management in 2003 indicates that there is a \"significant association between vehicle traffic and curbside concentrations of the carcinogens benzine, 1,3-butadiene, and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).\" The study provides a model for estimating curbside pollution levels associated with traffic that may be relevant to exposures in the urban environment.\n\n2) Increasing Public Transportation and Cutting Traffic Reduces Asthma Attacks\nA study reported in the 2001 Journal of the American Medical Association found that increasing public transportation as well as other traffic control measures during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics reduced ozone concentrations by 28%, reduced acute asthma attacks by up to 44% and reduced morning peak traffic by 22%.\n\n3) Truck Traffic Linked to Childhood Asthma Hospitalizations\nA study conducted in Erie County, New York (excluding Buffalo) found that children living in neighborhoods with heavy truck traffic within 220 yards of their homes had increased risks of asthma hospitalization.\n\n4) Fine Particulate Matter Linked to Lung Cancer, Cardiopulmonary Mortality\nA study that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that day-to-day exposure to fine particulate matter, a major component of diesel exhaust, increased the risk of various adverse health effects. Each 10 microgram\/meter elevation in fine particulate air pollution leads to an 8% increased risk of lung cancer deaths, a 6% increased risk of cardiopulmonary mortality and a 4% increased risk of death from general causes.\n\n5) People Who Live Near Freeways Exposed to 25 Times More Soot Particle Pollution\nStudies that were conducted near Interstates 405 and 710 in Southern California found that ultra-fine particulates in the air were about 25 times more concentrated near the highways and that pollution levels gradually decrease back to normal (background) levels around 330 yards, downwind from the highway. The study notes that motor vehicles are the most significant source of ultra-fine particles, which have been linked to increases in mortality and morbidity.\n\n6) Children Living Near Busy Roads More Likely to Develop Leukemia, Cancer\nA study conducted in 2000 in Denver showed that children living within 250 yards of streets or highways with 20,000 vehicles per day are six times more likely to develop all types of cancer and eight times more likely to get leukemia. It suggested that volatile organic compound pollution from the roadway may be the cancer promoter causing the problem.\n\n7) Motor Vehicle Pollution Dominates Cancer Risk from Air Pollution\nThe most comprehensive study of urban toxic air pollution ever undertaken shows that motor vehicles and other mobile sources of air pollution are the predominant source of cancer-causing air pollutants in Southern California. The study showed that about 90% of the cancer risk from toxic air pollution comes from motor vehicles.\n\nWhile the highway builders claim that they are helping economic growth, it is in the hospitals where the jobs are created (where the illnesses they cause are treated).\n\nTo get contact information for the people who published these studies, please contact the GASP Office."}

More than 80% of auto emissions come from less than 30%\nof the cars.\n\nChange your oil\nonly when necessary. Independent tests by Consumer Reports\u016a magazine\nindicate that changing modern motor oils every 7,500 miles (synthetics\nat 12,000 miles) or at the automakers suggested intervals, is more\nthan adequate under most driving conditions.* Also consider using\n100% Synthetic motor oils to extend drain intervals on your vehicle.\n\nRecycle used\nmotor oil. Each year over 140 million gallons of used motor oil end\nup in our landfills. When you take your oil to a recycling location,\nbe sure to use a proper reusable container with a tight fitting cap.\n\nClean out that\ntrunk! You get four percent less gas mileage for every 100 pounds\nof excess cargo in your automobile, and that means increased air emissions.\n\nNew cars are\ncleaner than ever, but we have more of them every year.

{"text":"Creating a stink about traffic pollution\u2026\n\nDisclosure Statement\n\nAdrian Barnett and Joacim Rockl\u00f6v do not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article. They also have no relevant affiliations.\n\nIt's currently difficult to limit your exposure to traffic pollution because you can't smell it.\nFlickr\/p\u0259ruse and death.\n\nIf traffic pollution had a distinctive smell, its levels could be judged by anyone at anytime. The smell would be strongest during the morning rush hour, and at busy junctions where the traffic builds up and engines idle.\n\nGiven the many negative health consequences of traffic pollution, people may want to limit their exposure. But this is difficult because most exhaust gases are odourless and invisible. There are slight smells from sulphur dioxide (rotten eggs) and nitrogen dioxide (acrid burning), but nothing from some of the most dangerous pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, particulate matter and ozone.\n\nKnowing the dirtiest times and places would then enable people to avoid exposure, which is a key recommendation by the recent expert review on reducing the harms of traffic pollution. Exposure could be avoided by taking a different route to work, or jogging at a different time of the day.\n\nThe possibility of making traffic pollution smell is demonstrated by the already smelly exhausts of some alternative fuels, such as chip fat. A smell could be added to standard fuels by using an additive, such as methanol or butanol, that smells after combustion. It may also be possible to create a temporary smell-making device that fits to exhausts. These devices could be handed out on World Environment Day (June 5) to create the largest stink.\n\nIf traffic pollution smelled it might encourage policy changes to reduce exposure. One easily fixable example is drive-throughs, where staff spend long hours next to idling engines, and often in enclosed spaces. The staff and their employers are probably unaware of their high exposure to traffic pollution. Adding a smell would soon change that, and could then instigate a simple policy such as asking waiting drivers to turn off their idling engines.\n\nAnother example where turning off idling engines could realise massive health benefits are school pick-up zones, where lines of children (whose lungs are particularly vulnerable to traffic pollution) stand next to lines of idling engines. If children, parents and schools were made aware of the problem of traffic pollution via a smell, we're sure many schools would encourage parents to turn off their idling engines.\n\nA public that is more aware of the health effects of traffic pollution may also be more amenable to difficult policy changes such as pedestrianising city centres, which are often heavily polluted. It may also make the public more wary of the planned locations of new roads. Many of the recently added or expanded roads in Brisbane are right next to hospitals and schools, two places where increasing traffic pollution will have a strong negative impact on health.\n\nWe've become accustomed to warnings for most other dangers we encounter. In many countries, a warning agent is added to liquid gas to warn of leaks. Likewise, the dangers of vehicles reversing are flagged using loud noises. There's little difference between adding a noise to vehicles and adding a smell, as both appeal to our senses in order to reduce morbidity and mortality.\n\nThere are some downsides to adding a smell to traffic pollution. A strong smell would penetrate into peoples' homes, especially those who live near major junctions. This may cause a sense of helplessness and frustration, as well as a social stigma for those who live in the smelliest areas.\n\nThe petrol and automotive industries are unlikely to support this change. They will probably argue that time and money is best spent elsewhere, such as on developing improved fuel or vehicle technology to reduce traffic pollution. But a completely clean vehicle fleet is 20 to 40 years away, so interventions to reduce pollution exposure are needed now.\n\nGovernments may be reluctant to impose a measure that is unpopular with big business, who lobby and fund re-election campaigns. However, the arguments against doing nothing are strong, and the success of difficult policy changes such as the smoking ban in pubs shows that such bold policy changes are\u2026 what the manufacturers of woodburners want.\n\n50 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic metre of air as the allowable limit has a lot of nasty death and disease being allowed. I think it should be more like 10 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic metre of air which allows only for natural sources such as dust and salt laden air.\n\nIf this means dirtier vehicles and two-stroke motorcycles are ordered off the road, and comprehensive bans on using woodstoves then good. That is actually what we need.\n\nAir quality monitoring in New Zealand for instance is so patchy and sparse that it is almost completely useless, but not measuring and assuming the actual measurements would pass (the already too lax standards) is the only way they pretend to meet the standards. New Zealand instead of being \"100% pure\" or \"clean and green\" actually suffers some appalling air quality. following\u2026 following and that it could be partly responsible for the large number of lung cancers in cities, in tandem with tobacco smoking.\n\n\"Diesel exhaust is around 40 times more carcinogenic than cigarette smoke on a weight\/volume basis (Gong and Waring, 1998). Up to a fifth of lung cancer deaths are attributed to exposure to fine particles of vehicle exhausts.\"\n\nI am again reminded of WHO's procrastination in providing vital information to a global community on hazardous air pollutants. The organisation's impotence in the face of evidence which has been established by reputable health experts many years prior should question the appropriateness of a global health organisation to properly address these health issues."}
{"text":"InspectAPedia tolerates no conflicts of interest. We have no relationship with advertisers, products, or services discussed at this website.\n\nFireplace or woodstove odors, smells, & dust problems in buildings: this article explains the impact of fireplaces or woodstoves on indoor air quality in homes. We explain what causes these complaints and we describe how to prevent them.\n\nTraditional open fireplaces\nand older leaky woodstoves burn very inefficiently\nand produce hundreds of chemical compounds, including\ncarbon monoxide, organic gases, particulates, and some of\nthe same cancer-causing agents found in tobacco smoke.\n\nMinor spillage of these pollutants occurs regularly, primarily\nwhen starting or stoking the fire.\n\nHowever, the larger\nconcern is when the fire smolders late at night, producing high levels of CO and a weak draft. Backdrafting at this\ntime can be dangerous or even fatal.\n\nAnother problem, particularly with fireplaces, is created\nwhen the fire is roaring and drawing up to 400 cfm of\ncombustion air. At this point, its voracious appetite for air\ncan cause backdrafting in other combustion appliances\nsuch as a gas water heater. Also, the need to reheat all the\nmakeup air drags down the fireplace's heating efficiency\nto less than 15% and, if the fireplace is allowed to smolder\nall night, it becomes a net heat loser.\n\nThe Jotul woodstove shown at left was traded for a wristwatch. The new owner installed the stove including a fireproof tile-covered barrier between the stove and a nearby building wall. The owner later added the metal heat reflector to the right of the stove to adjust room comfort and heat movement. Photo courtesy Paul Galow. That woodbox is too close - less than 36\" from the woodstove.\n\nWoodstove efficiency has improved dramatically in\nresponse to EPA emissions standards (begun in 1988 and\nupdated in 1990), which apply to most freestanding wood\nstoves and to fireplace inserts with air-supply controls and\ntight-fitting doors.\n\nTo meet these standards, manufacturers\nuse either a catalytic converter, similar to the ones used in\ncars, or a reengineered firebox.\n\nThe new fireboxes have\nprimary and secondary combustion zones capable of\nreaching system efficiencies of 60% or more and reducing\ncombustion air intake to as little as 10 cfm. If installed\nwith an outdoor air supply, these can be successfully de-\ncoupled from household air pressures.\n\nWhile many fireplaces are fitted with glass doors, and\nsome have outside air intakes, nearly all of the glass doors\nleak air. Even with low levels of depressurization, these\nfireplaces can still backdraft, and the fireplace's outdoor\nair supply might become the makeup air for the kitchen\nrange hood or other exhaust fans, drawing fireplace fumes\nalong with it. The best solution is an airtight fireplace\ninsert.\n\nTo minimize pollution, indoors and outside, from wood-burning appliances\n\nWatch out: several of our clients report, and tests confirmed horrible building odor problems after excessive use of ozone as a \"cure\" for fireplace or woodsmoke or creosote odors in buildings. Excessive or improper use of ozone as an \"odor killer\" in such situations can lead to oxidation of other building materials that then give off chemical or plastic odors that cannot be cured without removing and replacing the mateirals affected.

{"text":"With rapid globalisation the environmental issues are seen to be one of\nthe most important topics. The pollution created in any manner such as air\nemission, effluent, land contamination etc. have several impacts on\npeople, throughout the world.\n\nIt is expected that by the next generation about 90% of the world's\nadditional people will live in towns, pace of urbanisation poses huge\nenvironmental challenges for the cities such as the problems of\nsanitation, clean water, energy and pollution from industry.\n\nAdverse impacts of pollution\n\nFor many years it has been known that the quality of groundwater has\nbeen affected by increasing levels of nitrates and fertilisers that leak\nfrom agricultural lands.\n\nConsiderable quantum of groundwater pollution in the form of heavy\nmetals, hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons is reported in many\ncountries. During the past 25 years, stricter water quality legislation in\nmany countries has resulted in reduced pollution from point sources like\ncommunities and industry.\n\nAir pollution can have both direct and indirect effects on the\nenvironment and on human health. Air pollutants that have considerable\nenvironmental impact include sulphur dioxide (So2), nitrogen oxide (No2)\nand carbon dioxide (Co2).\n\nThe local effects of air pollution include city smog caused by\nphotochemical oxidants and nuisances caused by dust and smell. Other\nfactors include toxic effects that can elevate lead levels in children,\ncarcinogenic effects and other unwelcome health effects like respiratory\nproblems.\n\nLand pollution is the degradation of the earth's land through human\nmisuse of soil. It is an accepted fact that as human influences such as\npoor agricultural practices, the digging up of important resources;\nindustrial waste dumping has resulted in an irreparable damage to the land\nand has led to pollute the land rapidly.\n\nThis indicates that the disciplined approach of human behaviour plays a\nvital role in maintaining the cleanliness and prosperity of our earth's\nfuture.\n\nHowever solutions to the land pollution have become increasingly\nrecognised over the years. The most common and convenient method of waste\ndisposal is considered as the sanitary landfill.\n\nThe danger of pollutant is that once the pollutants enter the\nenvironment those will cycle throughout the air, water and soil and\ncontinue to transfer from one medium to another.\n\nPreventive approach\n\nComprehensive environmental pollution system requires both pollution\nprevention and pollution control. Pollution prevention saves energy and\nresources, in most cases; it is more cost-effective than direct regulation\nin the long run.\n\nAt a time when economic competitiveness is a national priority, there\nis a need for an economically sound approach to prevent pollution.\n\nHowever cost savings from prevention come not only from avoiding\nenvironmental costs like hazardous waste disposal fees but also from\navoiding costs that are often more challenging to count, like those\nresulting from injuries to workers and ensuring losses in productivity.\n\nIn that sense, prevention is not only an environmental activity but\nalso a tool to promote worker health and safety.\n\nInternational standard for prevention of pollution\n\nConsidering the environmental issues taking place in the world, the\nInternational Standards Organisation (ISO) had initiated actions to\nprepare an international standard on Environmental Management to provide\nassistance to organisations that wish to implement or improve their\nenvironmental performance.\n\nAs a result in the year 1996, ISO 14001 standard on Environmental\nManagement Systems - specifications with guidance for use has been\nintroduced. The overall aim of this international standard is to support\nenvironmental protection and prevention of pollution in balance with\nsocio-economic needs.\n\nISO 14001 - Environmental Management System standard requires an\norganisation to formulate an environmental policy and set objectives\ntaking into account legislative requirements and information about\nsignificant environmental impacts.\n\nBesides complying with applicable legislation and regulations the\norganisation must also demonstrate its commitment to continual improvement\nrelated to environmental issues of the organisation.\n\nThe standard is applicable to any organisation that wishes to implement\nmaintain and improve an environmental management system, as well as those\ncompanies that seek certification\/registration of its environmental\nmanagement system by an external organisation.\n\nRevision of ISO 14001\n\nThe second edition of this international standard ISO 14001:2004 is\nfocused on clarification of the first edition and has taken due\nconsideration of the provisions of ISO 9001:2000 to enhance the\ncompatibility of the two standards for the benefit of the user community.\n\nMoreover the new version of ISO 14001 provides organisations with the\nelements of an effective environmental management system that can be\nintegrated with other management system requirements in an easy manner to\nachieve environmental and economic goals.\n\nOne of the important features of the new version is that it makes the\nguidance annexure more comprehensive and informative clarifying most of\nthe grey areas of the Environmental Management System.\n\nTherefore the new version would really help the organisations to\nproceed in establishing sound Environmental Management System to handle\nthe environmental issues.\n\nIt is worthwhile to remember that the success of the system depends on\ncommitment from all levels and functions of the organisation and\nespecially from top management.\n\nWith the publication of new version it is now necessary to up-grade the\nalready certified systems in compliance with ISO 14001:2004. However a\ntransition period of twelve months is normally recommended by the\ninternational community.\n\nIn view of the publication of the new version, SLSI has already planned\na series of training programmes to educate the business community about\nthe changes made in the new standard.\n\nFurthermore for certified companies SLSI intends to provide an\nadditional gap analysis report during the surveillance audits in order to\nhelp the said companies to have a smooth transition to new version.\n\nHowever if any organisation is having an idea to proceed in obtaining\ncertification, it is necessary to develop an Environmental Management\nSystem (EMS) as per the new version of ISO 14001:2004.\n\nBenefits of an EMS\n\nAn effective EMS can help an organisation avoid, reduce or control the\nadverse environmental impacts of its activities, products and services\nbetter assure compliance with applicable legal and other requirements and\nassist in continually improving environmental performance.\n\nHaving an EMS can help an organisation assure interested parties that:\n\n* A management commitment exists to meet the provisions of its policy,\nobjectives, and targets;\n\n* Emphasis is placed on prevention;\n\n* Evidence of reasonable care and regulatory compliance can be\nprovided;\n\n* The system's design incorporates the process of continual\nimprovement."}

It emanates from the earth and on a smaller scale from certain construction materials and water pipes;\n\nRadon is everywhere and in the open air it rapidly disperses and rarely reaches hazardous concentrations. The gas is much more harmful when present indoors, where it tends to accumulate, reaching levels likely to represent a risk to health;\n\nthe UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) has stated that radon is the main source of ionising radiation to which the world's population is exposed. In 1988 the International Agency for Cancer Research of the World Health Organisation (WHO) identified radon as a 'Class A' carcinogen, putting it in second place (10%) after tobacco smoke (85%) as the cause of lung tumours;\n\nthe risk of developing such severe symptoms among smokers exposed to radon is around 15 times higher than non-smokers exposed to the same concentrations.\n\nWorrying data exist from around the world on this radioactive gas\u2026\n\nthe National Academy of Sciences estimates an annual mortality rate of 15,000 to 22,000 in the United States alone. In a country like France, where the concentration levels are around the European average, deaths from lung cancer caused by radon are estimated at 10%. In the United Kingdom, where the standard concentration is lower, lung cancer cases are actually higher and health authorities estimate that around 2000 lung-tumour deaths result from exposure to the gas per year."}
{"text":"Dr, how many other foundries have you toured to enable you to determine if their air quality was worse than most? Perhaps we should continue looking for sources overseas so we don't have any bad-air conditions here?\n\nHamerin, you're saying that factory workers should just \"suck it up\" (no pun intended) so their jobs don't get outsourced overseas? When there's a thick haze of particulates hovering in the indoor air, I see that as a health issue, sorry.\n\nRight - now we really should make sure that the foundry floor is sterile, the workes in a foundry should all be sterile and the dust and dirt and grime normally found in a normal foundy should be totally outlawed. After all - working in a foundry shoud certainly not ever be associated with skilled workers doing a tough job working with metals and all sort of machinery in an environment that might be dirty and dusty consiering the work they are doing.\n\nThese were safety violations they were cited for previously - they should have had enough brains to correct them. Will cost them more in fines than it would have if they corrected the SAFETY violations.\n\nYet another JS article with no perspective. How does Grede compare to other similar foundries around the country? There's no question that the violations need to be corrected, but for all we know, Grede may be the Poster Child of foundries with far fewer violations than any others. It's just another JS spun half-story. They seem hell-bent on trashing every company they touch.\n\nThey wouldn't have been fined if their weren't violations, and being 28 violations and many second offenses, I'd say Grede wasn't doing a good job. It's not about how they compare to other plants, its how they compare to the standards being asked of them, it's no excuse just because everyone elseis doing it too...\n\nHank, don't be a moron. Why would the JS need to list, on every friggin article, how others are doing? It isn't about what others are doing. It's about what the rules are and this one company breaking them. If they are the best in the business, great. But they still are breaking the rules.\n\nAll foundries tend to be dirty and dangerous, and OSHA has so many regulations that essentially all businesses are in violation.\n\nIs this employer doing a reasonably good job of making what's inherently dirty and dangerous as clean and safe as possible? Honestly, it's impossible to tell, because an OSHA inspector can always find something wrong.\n\nPerhaps the violations are meaningful and should be cleaned up; or, perhaps they are not, and OSHA is just chasing the work out of the country, to places where \"dirty and dangerous\" have a different meaning.\n\nWho knows? I don't, and I'd guess the Journal-Sentinel doesn't. Perhaps those who work in the foundry do.\n\nI am always very skeptical of anything OSHA fines companies with doing.\n\nLike the OSHA representative who tried to fine us on an \"unsafe\" ladder on a project. The idiot OSHA guy climbed the ladder to tell everyone it was in violation. Apparently it was safe enough for for him to climb up but not for other mere mortals (hint to the rest of the discussion).\n\nThis is the mildest example I can cite. OSHA is more than capable to rain down a ton a stupidity in a very short period of time.\n\nI'm sure your company deserved the fines. Especially if you are in charge of health and safety. Did you point out to the OSHA inspector the \"unsafe act\" he or she was commiting? Or are you only man enough to do it behind a internet name\/handle.\n\nSportsgeek, you don't have much comprehension. I stated \"tried\" as in failed it was so stupid. Here's the kicker, we didn't climb that ladder. It was put up just before these idiots \"seagulled\" onsite crapping over everything.\n\nDo you think when OSHA has chased all of the businesses out of America they could start checking people's homes and cite and fine them for unsafe conditions. Wouldn't want OSHA employees to run out of work.\n\nHere's another swift OSHA move: Look on a flat roof on a commercial building. Those boxes are air conditioning units. To service them when they have a problem look up the OSHA rules for that because there is higher voltages being used.\n\nVirtually every manufacturer of that style product is in violation of OSHA standards and there is no way to service and repair those units without being in violation.\n\nTo even come close would cost a building owner many extra thousands of dollars in custom reconfiguration of the equipment and service technician fees of about $300\/hour to cover the overhead created by OSHA.\n\nOf course OSHA has no plan in place on how to follow their rules. They are great at rules and fines and less adept at methods.\n\nWhat happens now? Everyone ignores it and when something does happen (rare), OSHA comes in and can hand out some fines."}
{"text":"As this report focuses on improved cookstove adoption, we will operationalize this term for the reader. Adoption in the broadest sense is not an \"either\/or\" event. There is a continuum of cookstove practices that relate to consumer actions to reduce IAP. The first step is the acquisition of an improved cookstove. An improved cookstove is a stove that is more fuel efficient and releases fewer emissions than the one previously used. Usually, improved cookstoves are compared to a traditional \"three-stone\" fire, but they also can be compared to something more efficient than that but less efficient than the current improved cookstove. An improved cookstove may use the same kinds of fuel previously used (like wood) or something cleaner, like liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Making a change from one kind of fuel to another is adoption of cleaner fuel. In addition, there are cleaner kitchen practices promoted to reduce indoor air pollution that may be equally beneficial as improved cookstoves.\n\nChimneys can be built and windows can be put in kitchen walls, for example. Some improved cookstoves require changes in cooking behavior to realize their benefits, such as cooking two pots of food simultaneously instead of sequentially. A final issue with cooking practices is the use of multiple fuels\/stoves at one time also known as \"stacking\" of fuels\/stoves. In many households, traditional stoves are used at the same time as improved cookstoves, or the different stoves may be used for different foods. It is not merely the household acquisition of an improved cookstove, but its correct and sustained use to the relative exclusion of less efficient stoves that is critical to improving health, though any movement toward behaviors that reduce emissions are valued."}

{"text":"The Uninvited Guest\n\n2008 September 4\n\nAbout the author: Brenda Reyes Tomassini joined EPA in 2002. She is a public affairs specialist in the San Juan, Puerto Rico office and also handles community relations for the Caribbean Environmental Protection Division.\n\nLast Saturday, as I was watching the 11:00 p.m. news, the weather anchor gave an advisory of Sahara dust in the area. Too late I thought, since I have an asthmatic three year old. Most of us who suffer with asthma can feel the effects before satellites detect this Saharan cloud. Following the weather advisory, I had him stay inside the house all Sunday as a preventive measure. As feared, Monday morning came and he was wheezing with a full blown asthma attack.\n\nEvery summer, particles of dust from the Sahara Desert travel halfway around the globe and settle in the Caribbean area around Puerto Rico. This dust impacts not only our air quality, but the climate. This cloud, full of minerals and fungi, alters the quality of air and impacts not only respiratory health, but ecosystems as well. Some studies trace the loss of coral reefs in the Caribbean to this phenomenon. It's incredible that these small particles from the Sahara Desert in Africa can cause so many adverse impacts to the environment and health an ocean away.\n\nAccording to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in July 2000 alone, nearly eight million tons of dust from Africa reached Puerto Rico. That's the equivalent of eight million pickup trucks (each pickup truck weighs one ton. Satellite imagery tracks this gigantic cloud that arrives from Africa every year, peaking between May and August in our area. Most of the population relies on the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board air quality information. Also the National Weather Service, issues warnings whenever the uninvited guest drops by our beautiful Caribbean island.\n\nI was counting my blessings all summer long since it had been five months since my son's last attack. A combination of factors had been successful in helping us manage his asthma over the past months. First the medications, second, I had been very vigilant about indoor asthma triggers and third, during the summer, since he was at home, I made him stay indoors every time the air quality index rose to alert levels.

{"text":"April 15, 2011 Dr. Michael Waring, assistant professor of civil architectural and environmental engineering, is investigating indoor air quality to improve human health while integrating it with his career goal of increasing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education in the community. Waring will take on the unique approach of integrating the air quality research with a curriculum beginning this month.\n\nThe project will launch with Waring leading a team of undergraduate, graduate and high school students in research that will examine Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA) formation. SOA is airborne particulate matter that forms indoors from ozone reactions with terpenoids, or organic chemicals, emitted by consumer products. The team will analyze how size-distributions of SOA evolve in time over a range of indoor environmental parameters that include the building air exchange rate, temperature and humidity, as well as the magnitude of SOA exposure for Americans. Exposure to particulate matter has been linked to asthma and other inhalation issues.\n\n\"The link between energy use and indoor air quality is a pressing problem in developing high performance buildings and we want to be sure we're not impacting the health of building occupants negatively as we reduce our energy use,\" said Waring.\n\nWaring will lead the investigation of SOA formation by using small chamber systems in Drexel's Environmental Engineering Laboratory and with real field studies in the future. By exploring the chemistry and physics of indoor particle formation, the team will be able to develop a model that will predict SOA formation. The model will be applied to calculate the SOA exposure for people under varying conditions in indoor environments. In Waring's classes, students will assess air pollution control methods in their own homes and help build a comprehensive online resource for indoor air quality education and research. Outreach activities will involve Waring's team of students delivering the indoor air-related projects into community schools to K-12 students to encourage STEM education.\n\nThe research is funded by Waring's five-year CAREER award from the National Science Foundation of $402,498.

At levels of 24% items such as clothing can spontaneously combust. Oxyacetylene welding equipment combines oxygen and acetylene gas to produce an extremely high temperature. Other areas where hazards may arise from oxygen enriched atmospheres include areas manufacturing or storing rocket propulsion systems, products used for bleaching in the pulp and paper industry and clean water treatment facilities.

{"text":"OLYMPIA - Colder weather prompts many Washington residents to start firing up wood stoves, fireplaces and other wood-burning devices to heat their homes.\n\nIf done right, burning wood can be a cheap way to heat your home. But using poor burning habits; wood that has not been dried properly; and old, inefficient devices can lead to burning up more wood - and money. It also produces large amounts of health-damaging wood smoke - one of the most serious air pollution problems in Washington.\n\nFine particles in smoke are so small they can easily get into your lungs. Once there, they can cause heart and breathing problems, and even death. People with asthma and respiratory illnesses, children and older adults are most at risk.\n\nHealth studies show that people who heat their homes with wood have more breathing problems than those who don't. Smoke particles also invade neighboring homes. Research shows that children in wood-burning neighborhoods are more likely to have lung and breathing problems.\n\nA 2009 analysis ( estimates that fine particles lead to about 1,100 deaths and $190 million in added health-care costs each year in Washington, according to the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology).\n\nEcology and local clean air agencies team up to help Washingtonians curb wood-smoke pollution. The agencies use burn bans, education and programs that pay part of the cost of new, cleaner-burning home-heating devices.\n\nFor example, since 2007 Ecology has provided about $3.6 million in grant money to local clean air agencies for such change-out programs. As a result, the programs helped to replace more than 2,000 old, polluting devices.\n\nHow burn bans work\n\nWhen fine particle pollution reaches unsafe levels, Ecology and local clean air agencies can call county-wide burn bans in their jurisdictions. These bans protect people's health by limiting wood burning in those areas.\n\nEcology and the clean air agencies use news media and social media to get out information on burn bans. The information also is available online at waburnbans.net ( Ecology post notices about its burn bans on the agency's website\n(\n\nStage 1 burn bans are called based on weather conditions and rising pollution levels. No burning is allowed in wood-burning fireplaces, uncertified woodstoves or uncertified fireplace inserts, unless it is your only source of heat.\nStage 2 burn bans are called when fine particle pollution levels reach a \"trigger value\" set by state law. No burning is allowed in any wood-burning fireplace, woodstove or fireplace insert (even certified models), unless it is your only source of heat.\nViolating a burn ban could lead to penalties, including fines.\n\nDuring Stage 1 and Stage 2 burn bans, all outdoor burning also is banned, even in areas where outdoor burning isn't permanently prohibited. The bans include agricultural and forest burning.\n\nBurn dry, clean wood\n\nWood needs to be stored for at least six months - and better yet, a year - to be dry enough to burn well. Dry wood creates a hotter fire that takes less work and uses wood more efficiently.\n\nWet or green wood needs more heat to evaporate the higher water content before the wood can burn and give off heat. That means you need to burn nearly twice as much wet wood to generate the kind of heat provided by dry wood. So you spend more money to buy wood, or invest more time and effort to harvest your own.\n\nHere's how can you get the most out of your wood supply:\n\nSplit it. The wood will dry best and burn most efficiently if the pieces are 3\u00bd to 6 inches in diameter.\n\nCover it. Protect the wood from rain and weather. Stack it loosely - in layers of alternating directions - to allow plenty of air circulation. Store it off the ground so air can circulate underneath.\n\nGive it a year. Wood that has been split, dried and stored under cover for at least a year usually burns best.\n\nBurning undried wood - and burning more of it because it's wet or green - produces more smoke than burning dry wood.\n\nHelpful tools you can use\n\nEcology's Air Quality Program has posted useful information about using wood for home heating ( Here are a few examples of what you can find:\n\nWashington's wood stove and pellet stove standards.\nLists of wood stoves, pellet stoves and fireplaces that meet those standards.\nWhat you can do to reduce wood smoke pollution.\nHelpful videos on how to select a wood stove and how to use it correctly.\nOpportunity to sign up for e-mail alerts on burn bans.\n\nSource: Washington Department of Ecology\n\nGovernor Schweitzer Calls on Stimson Lumber to Clean Up Mill Site\n(MISSOULA) - Today Governor Brian Schweitzer announced that the state will be requiring Stimson Lumber Company to clean up contamination at their former mill site in Bonner.\n\n\"This is a very important site,\" Governor Schweitzer said. \"It sits immediately upstream from the Milltown Dam"}
{"text":"PRLog (Press Release) - Jun. 15, 2012 - The top ten facts that you need to know about mold and mold health dangers in Texas are:\n\n1. Airborne mold spores are everywhere both indoors and outdoors. Texas residents and employees' health is at serious risk if there are elevated levels of mold spores indoors, as compared to an outdoor mold control test, in Texas homes and workplaces.\n\n3. Molds spores can cause serious health problems even if the spores are dead or dormant (inactive while waiting for more moisture to resume growth). Even the smell of dead or dormant mold can make some mold-sensitive persons ill.\n\n4. It is impossible to get rid of all mold spores indoors. Some mold spores will always be present in house dust and floating in the air.\n\n5. The mold spores will not grow into mold colonies if there is insufficient moisture. Indoor mold growth can and should be prevented or controlled by controlling moisture indoors. If organic materials are wet for more than 24 hours, mold growth can begin.\n\n6. Mold grows by eating and destroying organic building materials and other cellulose-based materials such as carpeting, upholstery, and clothing. The longer that mold grows, the more mold damage to the building.\n\n7. Cellulose is the main substance in the cell walls of plants (and thus of wood), and it is used in the manufacture of many organic building materials such as drywall, plasterboard, plywood substitutes, and ceiling tiles.\n\n9. Mold growth is often the result of a structural or construction defect, or of maintenance neglect, that allows moisture to enter the building.\n\n10. The owner or employer must first fix the water problem (roof leak, plumbing leak, high indoor humidity) that enables the mold to grow. Effective mold remediation requires killing the mold an EPA-registered fungicide, removing it, and treating the cleaned area with an EPA-registered preventive coating to stop future mold growth.\n\nFor free mold help and answers to your Texas mold questions, please email mold expert Phillip Fry at phil@moldinspector.com.

{"text":"Breathing the filth: Hydrocarbons in the air are more toxic than oil in the gulf\n\nJul 10, 2010 By Gary Polakovic\n\nWhat a relief it will be when the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico gets plugged, ending the colossal mess caused by gushing crude. Or will it?\n\nOnce the spill stops, oil will resume flowing as it always has, to be burned in engines, released to the sky and breathed deep into our bodies. We know now that these emissions contribute to a longer-term and perhaps ultimately more dangerous form of pollution -- climate change.\n\nAs deadly as the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe is, the pollution pales in comparison with the hydrocarbons spilling into the air over our cities, farms and highways. The oil spill ranks as the nation's worst environmental disaster only if you ignore the great ongoing spill in the sky.\n\nAir pollution is so ubiquitous that we accept it as part of the modern urban tableau with little fuss. Smog doesn't rivet attention as it did 62 years ago when an inversion layer trapped pollutants in Donora, Pa., killing 20 people in a few days and sickening thousands, or when smog was hazardous for everyone most of the time in Los Angeles. Images of a blazing oil rig and glop-coated birds skew our sense of proportion and risk.\n\nThe numbers reveal that the dangers we accept as familiar are worse in the long haul than sudden disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon.\n\nExperts estimate that the oil spill now spews as much as 60,000 barrels of crude a day, equivalent to about 8,820 tons.\n\nCalifornians alone disgorge about 2,215 tons of hydrocarbons into the air every day; what Deepwater Horizon does to the Gulf of Mexico in one day, we do to the air in four days.\n\nIt takes the smoggy Los Angeles region less than two days to match the pollution the Deepwater Horizon blowout produces in one, if you count the 4,740 tons per day of various emissions from combusted fossil fuel such as carbon monoxide, microscopic particles, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.\n\nWorst-case estimates place the total oil spilled in the gulf at about 126 million gallons over two months. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the country disgorges that much hydrocarbon pollution to the air in 10 days.\n\nIf TV cameras swooped in on Southern California emergency rooms during summer's smoggy days, they would find, instead of dead fish or birds, asthmatic children and elderly patients gasping for breath. A recent study by researchers at Cal State Fullerton shows that at least 3,860 people die prematurely from smog annually in California.\n\nIf you could somehow film events inside a placenta, you might see the moment when carbon monoxide gas and ozone -- both directly related to fossil fuel combustion -- cause a fetus in a smoggy city to be three times more likely to develop heart defects than other babies, according to research by UCLA and the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program.\n\nThe economic losses resulting from air pollution, measured in missed days of school, lost workdays or healthcare costs, number in the billions of dollars. Yet, unlike the $20 billion restitution fund for victims of the Gulf of Mexico spill, no remuneration exists for victims of hydrocarbons dumped in the air. While the goal in the gulf is to stop the mess, the goal for the air is to limit the discharge to a conscionable level of damage.\n\nIt's true that clean-air regulations have led to substantial reductions in smog-forming emissions released to the sky. There are tangible benefits as a result.\n\nBut the more we learn about the effects of the great spill in the sky, the more we learn how dangerous the emissions are. Ultrafine particles -- so tiny thousands could fit on the dot of this \"i\" -- from diesel combustion have been linked to heart attacks, birth defects and cancer. And black carbon, or soot, from diesel exhaust is proving to be a major greenhouse pollutant with a unique heat-trapping ability to settle on and heat ice sheets like an electric blanket.\n\nUnlike in the past, when clean-air laws had broad bipartisan support, lately the political will to tackle the great spill in the sky has faltered. President Obama's recent Oval Office speech invoked a national military emergency for oil spill response, yet the country seems more willing to unite against enemies abroad than to respond to threats to our environmental health and safety.\n\nTo wit, 47 U.S. senators sought to block the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions last month. Not a single Republican lawmaker supported the energy bill in the Senate, and only eight GOP lawmakers supported the House-approved bill reckoning with greenhouse gas pollutants earlier this year. Half the country was chanting \"Drill, baby, drill!\" just 18 months ago while Obama and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called for expanded offshore drilling.\n\nCalifornia voters will consider an oil industry-sponsored ballot measure Nov. 2 to suspend the state's pioneering program for a modest reduction in global warming pollutants, a program that has the potential for a renaissance of clean-tech innovation, economic growth and gains against multiple air pollutants.\n\nWill the oil spill in the gulf become an inflection point similar the 1969 spill off the Santa Barbara coast, which ignited a groundswell of environmental support? Not until we gain a sense of proportion about all the hydrocarbons we discharge, and a reckoning with our petroleum dependency.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(AP) -- The new presidential oil spill commission will focus on how safety, government oversight and the ability to clean up spills haven't kept up with advances in drilling technology, the panel's leaders say.With oil from the big Gulf of Mexico spill threatening fragile coastal wetlands, clean-up crews are about to discover whether a combination of old and new clean-up methods will help limit the environmental damage.

We get quite enough arguments, both ways, from the comments on almost all enviornmental stories. Frankly, I'm tired of arguments from both sides.\n\nThe Carolina Scotsman is right. Science has become so political that it can not be trusted!\n\nI think you were trying to say something different... Perhaps editorials purporting to be scientific reports?

In addition, it has suggested that lead-free gasoline should be made easily available at less than the market price of leaded gasoline. This would encourage consumers to switch to unleaded gasoline, with substantial attendant health benefits, the report pointed out.\n\nEmphasising the need to establish and stringently enforce a standard for oil quality, the report has suggested that taxes could be used to set the price of oil according to its quality. The report also called for establishing more maintenance stations capable of carrying out annual or bi-annual inspections to enforce clean vehicle standards. Indian refineries also require modifications in order to produce low-sulphur diesel, the report noted.\n\nPublic awareness and participation are instrumental in bringing about policy change and environmental education to promote understanding of the linkages between pollution and health.\n\nIn this regard, the report said private sector participation through innovative schemes, such as accepting delivery from trucks that meet government emission standards, adopt-a-street campaigns and air quality monitoring displays is a must. The bank has warned that the megapolis will be confronted by a major environmental crisis unless these measures are rapidly implemented, specially in light of the rapid expansion of industries and a 103 per cent increase in the number of vehicles plying on Mumbais roads over the past decade.\n\nThe report has listed the transport sector as the chief culprit for Mumbais air pollution, followed by power plants, industrial units and domestic burning of wood and garbage.\n\nNoting that the annual average concentration of air particulates known as Total Suspended Particles (TSP) had increased by nearly 50 per cent between 1981 and 1990, the report pointed out that pollutant concentrations in Mumbai often exceeded the World Health Organisations air quality guidelines as well as national guidelines.\n\nThe report said long-term exposure to high levels of these pollutants resulted in increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses, diminished lung functions and premature deaths from respiratory causes.\n\nIn addition, average concentrations of leadwhich have an adverse impact on blood pressure, the nervous system and kidneysdoubled from 1980 to 1987, while the incidence of nitrous oxidewhich causes lung damageincreased by roughly 25 per cent, said the study.\n\nOnly sulphur dioxide concentrations had declined as a result of the increased use of natural gas and low-sulphur content coal, said the report."}
{"text":"18, 2009\n\nEPA to tighten rules on sulfur dioxide emissions\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday it would tighten its limits on sulfur dioxide emissions for the first time since 1970s. The new proposal would limit SO2 emissions at 50 to 100 parts per per billion per hour, Ayesha Rascoe of Rueters reports. Current regulations limit emissions, the majority of which come from fossil-fuel burning power plants, to 140 ppb over 24 hours and an average of 30 ppb per year.\n\nThe changes are an effort to address new data that says people are more at risk when exposed to higher amounts of SO2 in short periods of time. Clean Air Watch President Frank O'Donnell told Rascoe the existing rules essentially have a loophole that allows high levels of sulfur dioxide to be emitted in short bursts.

{"text":"\"We found that outdoor air pollution, ozone, is associated with symptoms of lower-respiratory and upper-respiratory stress that occur in buildings to workers,\" says environmental health scientist Michael Apte of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who analyzed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data gathered on office air quality across the country. \"These symptoms are prevalent at fairly high levels throughout the U.S. and are similar in other parts of the world.\"\n\nSick building syndrome is a term used to describe a broad range of ailments, including dry eye, congestion, difficulty breathing, fatigue and headaches that strike workers inside office buildings but disappear when they leave the premises. Previous studies have shown that individuals may exhibit such symptoms when irritating chemicals and particles are found in the air and that ventilation with clean air can help alleviate or prevent the problem.\n\nThe EPA from 1994 to 1998 tested indoor air quality and surveyed office workers in 100 buildings in 37 cities\u2014from the smoggiest to the cleanest\u2014across the country. Nearly all of the buildings had mechanical ventilation systems rather than windows or other natural means of circulating air. Officials measured air quality across a broad range of seasonal conditions, from an office in North Dakota on a \u201318-degree Fahrenheit (\u201328-degree Celsius) day to a workplace in Arizona on a 108-degree F (42-degree C) day.\n\nThe EPA found that, on average, even in buildings with no special history of sickness, nearly 19 percent of workers surveyed complained of dry eye, 21 percent felt congested on the job, 4 percent complained of difficulty breathing, more than 19 percent felt fatigued, and more than 15 percent reported having headaches while at work.\n\nApte and his colleagues compared the EPA office data with the agency's measures of local atmospheric ozone levels to determine whether they were linked. Their findings, published in the journal Indoor Air: the number of workers suffering symptoms indoors increased with the amount of smog outside\u2014even at levels below the national limit of 80 parts per billion of ozone in air over an eight-hour period set by the EPA.\n\n\"Our body is telling us that there is something irritating in the air,\" Apte says. \"People in the work condition are under all kinds of stress, but it does seem to be a real physical response.\"\n\nThe researchers found that the type of air filter used in a building's ventilation system was also tied to the number of ill people. \"There is a six times greater likelihood that these symptoms will occur if you have both higher ozone levels and the polyester or synthetic filters,\" Apte says, \"than if you are in lower ozone levels and using a fiberglass filter.\"\n\nNo specific cause for sick building syndrome has been identified, but Apte speculates that the symptoms are due to unstable ozone molecules chemically interacting with the wide range of materials found in an office building, beginning with the polyester air filter. \"Glass is really a very inert material,\" Apte says of the fiberglass filters. \"On the other hand, polyester is a polymer and it's got a lot of bonds in there that are capable of being broken up by ozone"}
{"text":"Mar 07, 2012\n\nIn residential neighborhoods near manufacturing industries, a breath of air may be more hazardous than refreshing depending on the location, finds a recent study involving a Kansas State University geologist.\n\nSaugata Datta, assistant professor of geology at Kansas State University, along with researchers at Columbia University and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Department of Environmental Health Sciences, explored levels of the elemental metal manganese in airborne particulate matter -- a combination of dust, soot and other organic and inorganic particles suspended in a gas or liquid. Five counties across the U.S. were sampled as researchers characterized manganese and identified if manganese concentrations in the airborne particulate matter varied by geographic region.\n\n\"Manganese is an element that was originally thought to have a lot of nutritional aspects for humans and was relatively harmless health-wise,\" Datta said. \"But more recently that thinking is changing. Manganese is a neurotoxin at certain levels when in water, so there is a question about if it's toxic in air, too.\"\n\nManganese can be introduced into particulate matter -- and consequently the air -- through vehicle exhaust; vapor emissions from power plants, manufacturing industries and smoke stacks; battery and electronics manufacturing; welding; and auto manufacturing, Datta said. Tests on subways have also shown elevated levels of manganese in particulate matter because of abrasion from the steel tracks.\n\nFor the study the team analyzed samples of airborne particulate matter from Sacramento County, Calif.; Pinellas County, Fla.; Anoka County, Minn.; Harris County, Texas; and Maricopa County, Ariz. Samples were collected by Johns Hopkins Particulate Matter Center and examined using spectroscopy and other techniques at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York.\n\nAir samples among the sites varied in total manganese, ranging from 0.01 micrograms\/mg to 0.67 micrograms\/mg. Samples' compositions also varied in types of manganese, which included manganese-2 oxide, manganese-3 oxide, manganese-2 acetate, manganese-2 pyrophosphate and manganese-2 sulfate at various levels at each location.\n\n\"Because the levels of manganese have not been monitored very much, it's hard to say whether these are high, low or average levels,\" Datta said.\n\nStudies on manganese and human health, though, have shown the element to be problematic, Datta said. Toxicological studies have linked airborne particulate matter containing manganese to respiratory and cardiovascular health. Additionally, long-term inhalation of manganese has been attributed to manganism, an irreversible disease similar to Parkinson's.\n\nResearchers also found that the samples of airborne particulate matter from residential neighborhoods near gas, electric and petroleum manufacturing and refineries showed the higher levels of total manganese than samples collected from around the industrial sites.\n\nThe researchers' study, \"Use of X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) to Speciate Manganese in Airborne Particulate Matter from 5 Counties Across the U.S.,\" was published in a recent issue of the journal Environmental Science and Technology. It is believed to be an important study to show that the particulate matter toxicity varies by location across the U.S., and one of the first to identify manganese oxidation states in airborne particulate matters.\n\nThe study was funded by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nDatta is also conducting a study on India's groundwater, which contains manganese and arsenic. The study includes Sankar Manalikada Sasidharan, a master's student in geology, India, and Sophia Ford, a geology undergraduate student, Wilson, Kan.\n\nThe Kansas State University team has found that if arsenic is present in the groundwater, so is manganese, which turns the base platform around a well gray. The team also found that higher levels of arsenic might be occurring with lower levels of manganese and vice versa.\n\nAccording to Datta, studies by research teams -- McArthur et al 2012 , ES&T and Biswas et al 2011, ES&T -- found that elevated levels of manganese in India's drinking water led to decreased intellectual function in children. However, the 2011 report from the World Health Organization does not include a guideline for manganese in water.\n\n\"These studies are a unique set of work that not many people are looking at,\" Datta said. \"We're attacking manganese, understanding the toxicity levels and understanding its chemistry in both air and in water. Both are pathways to be ingested by humans. In air most of it is caused by vehicles and industries, but in water it is affected by sediments that leach out. We want to attack back.\"\n\nIn the first ecological study of its kind in the world, a Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center researcher has uncovered the unique finding that groundwater and airborne manganese in North Carolina correlates with ...\n\nManganese is a chemical element naturally found in water, which can lead to various health, behavioral and intellectual development problems in children, according to a study by Maryse Bouchard published inWelders who are exposed to manganese from welding fumes, risk developing increased clumsiness \u2013 and the result may remain decades after exposure has ceased.

{"text":"Smoke and odour pollution\n\nSmoke Control Areas are designed to control emissions from domestic chimneys caused by the burning of coal and wood inside domestic dwellings. The Clean Air Acts of the 1950's gave local authorities power to declare all or part of the district to be a smoke control area. Within South Kesteven, parts of Grantham and Stamford are declared as smoke control areas. The district council is responsible for ensuring that the smoke control areas within the district are enforced. Smoke control legislation does not apply to garden bonfires, we do however discourage people from having garden bonfires which can cause serious nuisance to neighbouring properties. In these instances legal action may be taken. For more information on bonfires please see the link Guidance on garden bonfires. If you live in a smoke control area it is an offence to emit smoke from the chimney of a building. It is also an offence to acquire \"unauthorised fuel\" for use within a smoke control area unless it is for use in an \"exempt appliance\".\n\nWhat is an authorised fuel?\n\nThe list of authorised fuels can be viewed at the Air Quality website, see useful web links.\n\nDo I live in smoke control area?\n\nSee link to Smoke Control Area map.

Often people are not aware that they are causing a problem. However if the problem continues we ask you to complete a diary and return it to us. If the diary sheets are not returned we will assume that the warning letter has resolved your complaint and that no further action is required.\n\nOnce your record sheets have been returned the officer will contact you and discuss the case with you, setting out the method they will use to investigate your complaint.\n\nWhat actions can we take?\n\nThe information you provide on the diary sheets will help the case officer to assess the smoke problem and decide what action can be taken.\n\nWe can take action if the smoke pollution is a nuisance in law (a \"statutory nuisance\"). We will assess the smoke to see if it is sufficient to be a nuisance.\n\nWe can then serve a notice under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 requiring the smoke pollution to be stopped.\n\nPlease contact Environmental Protection Services if you require further information or you wish to make a complaint about smoke or odour nuisance.\n\nOdour Pollution\n\nOdour Pollution from commercial premises can be investigated as a statutory nuisance, similar to smoke investigations.

Massachusetts successfully led the charge up to the Supreme Court to obtain federal measures to reduce greenhouse gas pollution to address global warming. More recently, the Attorney General's office successfully argued to a federal appeals court that it should reject critics' attacks on greenhouse gas pollution standards. These victories allowed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) nationwide controls of global warming pollution to remain in force.\n\nBased on what we already know about climate, we strongly support EPA's newest effort to propose standards for greenhouse gas emissions from new coal-fired power plants. In addition, more protective national air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter, or soot, are essential, and the Attorney General's office is pursuing legal cases to achieve those goals, too.\n\nThe American Lung Association, meanwhile, has created the Massachusetts Healthy Air Campaign, an effort to protect public health by pushing for the strongest clean air protections.\n\nPoor air quality affects all of us and has consequences far beyond health risks. Even Massachusetts families not directly affected by asthma, and our state as a whole, will benefit because healthier air in Massachusetts will save taxpayers money by reducing health care costs.\n\nIn addition to asthma and its harms to health, the costs are significant and growing. In 2010, the total charges for hospitalizations in Massachusetts due to asthma totaled $113 million \u2014 a 126 percent increase since 2000. Of those costs, taxpayers are expected to pay 66 percent. Improving air quality will save Massachusetts taxpayers money by reining in these costs.\n\nPoor air quality in Massachusetts makes people sick and cuts lives short. Our children deserve better. We all must continue to fight for healthy air, better quality lives and to substantially reduce health care costs in Massachusetts. This will benefit all of us.\n\nMartha Coakley is the Massachusetts attorney general. Jeff Seyler is CEO of the American Lung Association of the Northeast."}

Ozone and particle pollution can be problems in rural areas \u2013 in both the summer and winter.\n\nOzone-forming pollution can travel long distances on the wind before reacting in the sun to form ozone. Ozone itself also can travel long distances, so even rural areas can have high ozone levels.

But it also forms when emission from power plants, highway vehicle or industrial activities chemically react in the atmosphere. Depending on where you live, particles can be a problem at any time of year!\nIn the eastern half of the country, for example, fine particle pollution tends to be regional and can be transported hundreds of miles, affecting both urban areas and rural areas nearby. In areas such as the Pacific Northwest or the Northeast, residential wood smoke can cause particle pollution to be higher in the colder months.

{"text":"Molly Sabatino, Broker, GRI, SFR, CREN\n\nCarbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning is a serious threat to many households so I wanted to take a quick minute to give you some information about Carbon Monoxide and the Illinois law that requires the installation of Carbon Monoxide detectors in your home. Please read over these Frequently Asked Questions and the enclosed brochure.\n\nWhat is Carbon Monoxide?\n\nCarbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless and toxic gas produced as a by-product of combustion. Any fuel burning appliance, vehicle, tool or other device has the potential to produce dangerous levels of carbon monoxide gas. Examples of carbon monoxide producing devices commonly in use around the home include:\n\nFuel fired furnaces (non-electric)\n\nGas water heaters\n\nFireplaces and woodstoves\n\nGas stoves\n\nGas dryers\n\nCharcoal grills\n\nLawnmowers, snow-blowers and other yard equipment\n\nAutomobiles\n\nHow many carbon monoxide detectors should I have and where should I place them?\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends a detector on each floor of a residence. At a minimum, a single detector should be placed on each sleeping floor with an additional detector in the area of any major gas burning appliances such as a furnace or water heater. In general, carbon monoxide detectors should be placed high (near the ceiling) for most effective use. Detectors should also not be placed within five feet of gas fueled appliances or near cooking or bathing areas.\n\nWhat are the medical effects of carbon monoxide and how do I recognize them?\n\nCarbon monoxide inhibits the blood's ability to carry oxygen to body tissues including vital organs such as the heart and brain. When CO is inhaled, it combines with the oxygen carrying hemoglobin of the blood to form carboxyhemoglobin. Once combined with the hemoglobin, that hemoglobin is no longer available for transporting oxygen.\n\nStage 3 Symptoms intensify. Potential for long term effects especially in the case of infants, children, the elderly, victims of heart disease and pregnant women.\n\nStage 4 Unconsciousness.\n\nStage 5 Death.\n\nWhat should I do when my carbon monoxide detector goes off?\n\nFirst and foremost, stay calm. Most situations resulting in activation of a detector are not life threatening and do not require calling 911. To determine the need to call 911, ask the following question of everyone in the household: \"Does anyone feel ill? Is anyone experiencing the 'flu-like' symptoms of headache, nausea or dizziness?\" If the answer is yes, evacuate the household to a safe location and have someone call 911. Failure to evacuate immediately may result in prolonged exposure and worsening effects from possible carbon monoxide gas. The best initial treatment for carbon monoxide gas exposure is fresh air. If the answer is no, the likelihood of a serious exposure is greatly diminished and one probably does not need to call 911. Instead, turn off any gas burning appliances or equipment, ventilate the area and attempt to reset the alarm. If the alarm will not reset or resounds, call a qualified heating and ventilating service contractor to inspect your system for possible problems. If at any time during this process someone begins to feel ill with the symptoms described above evacuate the household to a safe location and have someone call 911. rainI am very happy spring is here and I can enjoy the warm weather and the plants and flowers in my garden.

However, as time goes by and mortgage payments are missed and housing prices decline the seller is now faced with a short sale.\"\n\nA short sale is when the mortgage holder agrees to take less than what is currently owed on the home because the seller is unable to come up with the difference. In order to qualify for a short sale the seller must have endured some form of hardship that makes it difficult or impossible for them to pay their current mortgage.\n\nThe SFR coursework gives the agent the tools needed to help both sellers and buyers navigate the complex nature of short sales and foreclosures. Agents with their SFR are able to qualify sellers for a short sale, help them prepare a short sale package, negotiate with the lender. They can also direct sellers to legal, and finance professionals who can help them avoid a short sale.\n\nSabatino stated that, \"Sellers have many more options that just selling their home. There are programs designed to help them modify their current loan so they don't have to sell. This course showed me how to counsel my clients about their options.\"\n\nBuyers will also benefit from using an agent with their SFR because the agent will protect the buyers' interests by knowing how the process works and help limit the risk of making an offer on a short sale property. \"Knowing the ins and outs of the short sale process helps me while working with buyers. A short sale can take several months to close so I can educate my buyers about the time frame involved and move on if the buyer is not able to wait for bank approval.\"\n\nSabatino has been helping buyers and sellers in the Fox Valley for 5 years.

{"text":"Haze\n\nWith the Clean Air Act of 1977, Congress established a national goal of remedying existing, and preventing future, human-caused visibility impairment in the larger Wilderness Areas, National Parks, and National Wildlife Refuges that existed at the time. Air pollution likely impairs visibility to some degree on all federal lands. The visual range within the eastern U.S. is often just 15 to 30 miles, estimated at one-third of what it would be without human caused air pollution. In the West, the visual range averages between 60 and 90 miles, or about one-half of the visual range under natural conditions. Extensive data and visibility information can be found at \n\nHaze is caused by fine particles in the air that scatter and absorb light. When the amount of fine particles increases, more light is absorbed and scattered, resulting in a shorter visual range, less clarity and altered color.\n\nFive types of fine particles contribute to haze: sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and crustal (soil) material. The relative impact of each type of particle varies across the U.S. and from season to season.\n\nPlume Blight\n\nPlume blight occurs when a point source such as a smoke stack emits particulate matter or nitrogen dioxide into a stable atmosphere. These pollutants can form a thin, dark, coherent plume obscuring the view. This picture captures a classic example of plume blight. Blight occurs before the plume has been dispersed so widely that it is indistinct from the background. Both contrast and coloration may vary depending upon the plume constituents, the viewing background, the viewer angle, and the angle of the sun.\n\nContribution of Various Particulates to Haze\n\nSulfate particles form in the air from sulfur dioxide gas. Most of this gas is released from industrial sources such as coal-burning power plants, smelters, and oil refineries. Sulfates are the largest contributor to haze in the eastern U.S. In humid environments, sulfate particles grow rapidly to a size that is very efficient at scattering light.\n\nNitrate particles form in the air from nitrogen oxide gas. This gas is released from virtually all combustion activities, especially those in power plants, oil and gas production, and other industrial sources as well as in cars, trucks, and motors like those in lawn mowers and boats. Like sulfates, nitrates scatter more light in humid environments.\n\nOrganic carbon particles are emitted into the air and also form there as a reaction of various gaseous hydrocarbons. Major sources of organic carbon particles include vehicle exhaust, vehicle refueling and solvent evaporation. Hydrocarbon emissions from forests and wildland fire smoke are additional sources. Fire emissions also include primary organic particles in the form of uncombusted material.\n\nElemental carbon particles like soot are smaller than most other particles and absorb rather than scatter light. The brown clouds often seen in winter over urban areas and some mountain valley towns can be largely attributed to elemental carbon. These particles are emitted directly into the air from virtually all combustion activities. They are especially prevalent in diesel exhaust and smoke from the burning of wood and wastes.\n\nCrustal material, like dust, enters the air from dirt roads, fields, and other open spaces as a result of wind, traffic, and other surface disturbing activities.

Cars, trucks, and industries are much cleaner than they were in the past, and programs are in place to maintain this progress into the future. However, these programs are probably insufficient to restore visibility to its natural conditions in many protected areas.\n\nThe Forest Service is working closely with each of the 50 states as they develop plans to reduce regional haze impacting large wilderness areas and national parks which were in existence prior to the Clean Air Act.

Fine particulates (PM-2.5) that are prevalent in smoke are more efficient at scattering and absorbing light and impairing visibility than coarse particulates (PM-10). Smoke can cause short-term visibility impacts by obscuring the form, contrast detail, and color of near and distant features. It poses a safety hazard when it obscures visibility on land, water, or aerial transportation routes. Smoke can also cause public nuisance and complaints about loss of visibility, odor, and soiling from ash fall-out at relatively low pollutant concentrations."}

Exposure to carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Often a person or an entire family may not recognize that carbon monoxide is poisoning them. The chemical is odorless and some of the symptoms are similar to common illnesses. This can be particularly dangerous because carbon monoxide's deadly effects are rarely recognized until it is too late to take action against them.\n\nRadon Testing With Electronic Monitor\n\nThis inspection includes the placement of a testing device to measure the ongoing level of radon in the habitable areas of the home. These measurements evaluate the level of radon to determine if any form of improvement is required. Radon is a naturally occuring radioactive gas that is a by-product of the radioactive decay of uranium and radium. Studies of humans exposed to both high and low levels of radon have shown an increase in lung cancer. Radon is colorless, odorless and tasteless, so the only way to know the level of radon in your home is to test for it.\n\nThe EPA document A Citizen's Guide To Radon (Third Edition) provides the basic information everyone should know about Radon.

The report is compiled from the measurement of ozone and polluting particles in the air conducted by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency. Ozone is mostly emitted from exhaust pipes of vehicles while polluting particles are mostly from the burning of wood. State legislation played a big role in reducing the pollutants in the air in the Bay Area. California is also targeting 1 million zero emission vehicles on the roads by 2025.\n\nIn all of last year, ozone measurement in San Francisco has not once hit the unhealthy level set by federal agencies. Bay Area counties also on this list are Marin, Sonoma and Santa Cruz. However, Santa Clara County's high car usage has made the county's air quality the worst in the area.

The Inspector General's report suggests the Obama administration cut corners before concluding that climate-change pollution can endanger human health.\n\nBackground\n\nIn Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), the U.S. Supreme Court found that greenhouse gases are pollutants covered by the Clean Air Act. The Court held that the EPA administrator must determine whether emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, or whether the science is too uncertain to make a reasoned decision.\n\nAs a result of the Supreme Court decision, the EPA issued two new findings that paved the way for the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act:\n\nThe Administrator finds that the current and projected concentrations of the mix of six key greenhouse gases\u2014)\u2014in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations. This is referred to as the endangerment finding.\n\nThe Administrator also finds that the combined emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, and HFCs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of these key greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change. This is referred to as the cause or contribute finding.\n\nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007): Decided April 2, 2007. U.S. Supreme Court ruling that because greenhouse gases fit within the Clean Air Act's definition of \"air pollutant,\" EPA has authority to regulate emission of such gases from new motor vehicles."}
{"text":"Pollutants on the Ground\n\nThe CMET balloon group launched two balloons on March 18 which had very successful flights. The balloons were purposely brought down as they approached US airspace over the Gulf of Mexico. By doing 'soundings' -- forcing the balloons to go above and then below their usual altitudes of about 4000 meters -- we were able to discover winds going in different directions at different altitudes. This is important data in relation to air pollutant transport in the atmosphere.\n\nOn the way back from Mexico City, where the balloons were launched, to Veracruz, we tested a prototype of a new portable air quality monitoring system manufactured by my company, PAX Analytics, Inc.. The system consisted of a GPS sensor, which provides longitude, latitude and time, as well as sensors for the measurement of ambient levels of carbon monoxide and ozone. The picture above is a Google Earth plot showing carbon monoxide (CO) (red) and ozone (O3) (blue). The plots are scaled for easy viewing and what is important here is not so much the actual values, but the relative levels during different parts of the trip. The data appears to validate the model which stated that pollution flow was in a northeasterly direction on March 18.\n\nYou might also be interested in:"}

{"text":"United States Congress\n\nIn 1972, the U.S. Congress enacted the Noise Control Act (NCA). It declared that the policy of the United States is to promote an environment for all Americans to be free from noise that jeopardizes their health or welfare. The Office of Noise Abatement and Control (ONAC) was created within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee the impact of noise on the general public.\n\nIn 1982, funding to ONAC was virtually eliminated, depriving citizens of federal protection against noise and its deleterious effects.\n\nIn 1997, 2003 and 2005, Representative Nina Lowey (D-NY) introduced legislation that became known as the Quiet Communities Act. The bill would have provided refunding for ONAC.\n\nAdditional funds would be used to administer a national noise assessment program to identify trends in noise exposure and response, develop and disseminate information and public education materials on the health effects of noise. It would also establish regional technical assistance centers, which would use the resources of universities and private organizations to assist state and local noise control programs.\n\nThe bill would have also directed the EPA to conduct a study of the impact of aircraft noise on major metropolitan areas and recommend new measures the FAA could implement to mitigate these impacts.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an agency of the federal government of the United States charged with protecting human health and with safeguarding the natural environment.\n\nThe EPA does not maintain archived documents from ONAC or other published materials on noise pollution. The EPA have not conducted any studies on the causes and effects of noise pollution, including numbers of Americans affected by noise pollution.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets noise emissions standards for motorcycles. The standard for street-legal exhaust noise emissions is 80 dB(a). All motorcycles are required to display an EPA label on the chassis and exhaust pipe. The label match-up program was designed as regulatory measure for states and municipalities to control motorcycle noise.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is an agency of the United States Department of Transportation with authority to regulate and oversee all aspects of civil aviation in the United States. The FAA to develops and administers programs to control aircraft noise and other environmental effects of civil aviation.\n\nThe FAA has sections on their website covering environmental, airport and aircraft noise issues. The FAA has procedures to respond to the public about aircraft noise issues. The FAA's Aviation Noise Ombudsman serves as a public liaison for issues about aircraft noise questions or complaints.\n\nWhen the FAA Airspace Redesign Proposal was introduced, one of the goals was to incorporate noise abatement into its design efforts. According to Frank D Hatfield, FAA spokesperson: \"Noise...is one of the three priorities in the design.\"\n\nThis priority was later dropped and today the design itself will increase noise over New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Pennsylvania. The FAA's plan, based in part on the use of inadequate models to predict noise effects, manipulation of fleet mix, and overstated assumptions of projected growth in operations, is now being challenged by the communities affected as well as their representatives. There are several lawsuits pending.\n\nOther than failing to consider noise effects on communities, the design is misleading and incomplete. It will do little to reduce passenger delays, a major concern for passengers, which for the most part are weather related. The FAA intends to generalize the techniques developed in its Northeast Airspace Redesign Proposal to redesign the airspace of other regions.\n\nFederal Railroad Administration\n\nThe Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is a division of the United States Department of Transportation to promote rail transportation and safety.\n\nThe Office of Safety is responsible for enforcing the Railroad Noise Emissions Compliance Regulation that set maximum sound levels from railroad equipment and for regulating locomotive horns.\n\nThe FRA relies upon the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) noise and vibration impact assessment procedures for assessing improvements to conventional passenger rail lines and stationary rail facilities and horn noise assessment. The FTA is a separate agency that administers federal funding to state and city public transportation systems including buses, subways and commuter rail.\n\nOn October 2007, the House passed HR 2095, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act, which included language allowing for local quality-of-life waivers from federal horn decibel regulations.\n\nThe language allows for local operators, such as the Long Island Rail Road, to apply for a quality-of-life waiver. Current regulations do not allow for such appeals, and have an adverse affect on residents living close to the rails.\n\nFederal Highway Administration\n\nThe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is a division of the United States Department of Transportation that specializes in highway transportation. They administer construction and maintenance of the National Highway System consisting of Interstate Highways, United States Routes and most State Routes.\n\nFederal Transit Administration\n\nThe Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is an agency within the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) that administers federal funding to support a variety of locally planned, constructed, and operated public transportation systems. Public transportation includes buses, subways, light rail, commuter rail, streetcars, monorail, passenger ferry boats, inclined railways, and people movers.\n\nThe FTA released a manual that includes basic concepts, methods, and procedures for documenting the extent and severity of noise and vibration impacts from transit projects. The Transportation Research Board (TRB) is a division of the National Research Council, which serves as an independent adviser to the federal government and others on scientific and technical questions of national importance.\n\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency of the Executive Branch of the United States Government, part of the Department of Transportation. It describes its mission as \"save lives, prevent injuries, reduce vehicle-related crashes.\" In addition to its safety role, NHTSA is the major federal regulatory branch over the auto industry.\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets and enforces safety and health standards of workers. It is an agency within the United States Department of Labor. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts workplace safety and health research.\n\nOSHA mandates the use of back-up alarms on trucks. The electronic piercing noise emitted from current back-up alarms is a noise hazard for residents and workers. Improved back-up alarms emit a broadband sound (white sound) that prevents noise nuisance as the sound dissipates over a discrete distance.\n\nWe advocate that OSHA set new standards mandating the use of broadband sound back-up alarms.\n\nConsumer Product Safety Commission\n\nThe United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is an independent federal regulatory agency by Congress in the Consumer Product Safety Act. Congress directed the Commission to \"protect the public against unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with consumer products.\"\n\nSince 2006, following the resignation of one of its commissioners, the agency has been operating without a quorum. In 2007, President Bush had nominated Michael Baroody, a lobbyist for the National Manufacturer's Association. Following intense opposition from consumer groups, Baroody withdrew his nomination. Without three appointed commissioners, the agency has no power to involuntarily recall unsafe products. No other nomination has been made.\n\nThe agency has jurisdiction on thousands of consumer products, including toys and electronics, recreational vehicles (ATVs), landscaping equipment (leafblowers). The agency has placed no emphasis on noise hazards.\n\nKazuma Meerkat 50 Youth All-Terrain Vehicle\n\nThis powered ATV has no front brakes, no parking brake and can be started in gear. It is meant for children aged 6-11. The manufacturer is not willing to cooperate amid CPSC charges \"children are at risk of injury or death due to multiple safety defects with this off-road vehicle.\" The agency has no power to involuntarily recall the ATV.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, acting chairman Nancy Nord, and the previous chairman Hal Stratton, have taken nearly thirty trips paid for by lobbyists representing manufacturers. The trips were funded by key industries the agency regulates, including toys, appliances and children's furniture.\n\nIn October, 2007, Chairman Nord requested Congress to reject legislation that would strengthen the agency. According to the New York Times, the proposed provisions would have increased maximum penalties for safety violations and make it easier for the government to make public reports of faulty products, protect industry whistleblowers and prosecute executives of companies that willfully violate laws.\n\nNancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, has called for Nord to step down.\n\nDepartment of Environmental Protection\n\nThe Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is a name used by several states in the United States of America for the agency charged with proposing and enforcing environmental law. The state-level DEPs include: Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The city-level DEPs include: New York City.\n\nDepartment of Transportation\n\nState Liquor Commission\n\nMost states have a liquor commission charged with issuing licenses and permits to businesses, investigate violations and enforce provisions in state law. A liquor commission does not have criminal jurisdiction, but violations are actionable for administrative prosecution.\n\nThe agency can suspend or revoke liquor licenses to public establishments that are disorderly (noisy or rowdy) or where illegal activity takes place. Individuals, community groups, community councils and police can file complaints to the liquor commission.\n\nDepartment of Buildings\n\nThe Department of Buildings (DOB) is a name used by several cities for the agency charged with mandating standards and codes for the construction and maintenance of commercial, industrial, and residential buildings.\n\nMetropolitan Transit Authority\n\nThe Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) is a name used by several cities for the agency, public benefit corporation (public authority) that manages mass transit systems. In New York City, that also includes bridges and tunnels. An MTA often have broad powers to regulate its operation and public property. An authority is usually not part of the state budgetary process that gives them a certain independence.\n\nIn 2006, researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health found that exposure to noise levels on the MTA New York City transit system have the potential to exceed recommended guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The report was published in the Journal of Urban Health (New York Academy of Medicine).\n\nPolice Department\n\nA police department safeguards the life and property of the community they serve. They act in accordance with constitutional rights to impartially enforce the laws and preserve the peace. A police department investigates criminal matters (violations, misdemeanors, felonies); they do not handle civil matters. They do however, handle quality of life complaints.\n\nIn most communities, a noise ordinance mandates the police to investigate certain, but not all, types of noise complaints. For example, a complaint about a loud air conditioner at night is not actionable, but a complaint about a loud car stereo at night is actionable by the police.\n\nThere are three common perceptions of police by the public when calling with a persistent noise complaint.\n\nThe first is that the police are responsive to handling noise complaints, but the administrative code limits their ability to act to resolve the problem. For example, an officer responds to a complaint about a car alarm repeatedly going off in the middle of the night, but does not have the authority to physically disable the alarm or have the vehicle towed away.\n\nThe second is that police are unresponsive or indifferent to handling noise complaints, even if the administrative code gives them the authority to act.\n\nOne reason why police do not always respond is because there may not be enough officers on duty to handle the amount of calls. In addition to noise complaints, officers routinely handle traffic stops for possible DUI, domestic violence, traffic accidents, theft and shootings.\n\nThe third is that police are complicit or intentionally ignoring noise complaints, because of a conflict of interest, collusion or a political directive with no basis in law. For example, officers refuse to handle complaints about a noisy nightclub because they moonlight at the establishment as hired security.\n\nWe advocate that all police departments maintain community councils (forums) where police officials and the general public can regularly meet to discuss and find solutions to problems in the neighborhood.\n\nCase Study\n\nIn New York City, police officers and other government workers routinely violate the law by using government-issued permits to illegally park their vehicles. The permits allow government employees to park in designated areas, but not block fire hydrants, avoid paying parking meters, park on sidewalks, crosswalks, intersections and bus stops.\n\nIn addition to degrading the quality of life for residents, it also erodes the trust of government and law enforcement.\n\nThe NYPD has an unofficial \"no-hit\" policy on vehicles with government permits (legitimate or otherwise) in the window. When residents, business owners and civic groups confront the police, the typical response is, \"we don't ticket our own.\"\n\nThe City of New York was unresponsive to complaints until Transportation Alternatives published a study and created a website called Uncivil Servants that residents can post photos of the parking violations. The extensive media scrutiny prompted the administration to reduce the amount of city-issued parking permits to its workers.\n\nNoise Ordinance\n\nThe specific components of a noise ordinance must include a clear definition of the noise source(s), unacceptable noise levels (either decibel or plainly audible), time of operation (day and night hours), relative distance (from other properties), agency assigned to enforce the code, and penalties (fines and imprisonment).\n\nAdditional revisions to the noise code should be based on the number and types of noise complaints received and testimony at public hearings. It is critical to identify business lobbyists posing as individuals, also known as astroturfing.\n\nMost noise ordinances are actionable only if it is determined to affect a \"reasonable person of normal sensitivities.\" This qualifier almost always works against the complainant because it is easier to dismiss the complaint than to resolve it. Public officials often ignore residents who repeatedly complain about specific noise problems as being \"overly sensitive\". Put another way, officials assume the majority of people who do not complain prove that the minority complaints are invalid and frivolous.\n\nThe most common complaints from residents include noise from boom cars, car alarms, and motorcycles.\n\nAn effective enforcement measure for boom cars is called 'plainly audible standard' that allows an officer to determine noise levels. In Florida, noise offenders can be cited if the audio system is plainly audible at 25 feet.\n\nIn Lorain, Ohio, repeat offenders risk having their car impounded and their stereo equipment destroyed. In Gulfport, Mississippi, the police launched a public service campaign to raise awareness of the city's noise ordinance, which sets a penalty of up to $1,000 for disturbing the peace. Residents can report noise offenders through a website that the police can later follow up on.\n\nThe use of a audible car alarm system should be prohibited, including audible status indicators. There is no evidence that audible alarms work. Most alarms can be turned off or entirely removed from the vehicle at minimal cost. The sale and installation car alarms should also be banned.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets noise emissions standards for motorcycles at 80 dB(a). All motorcycles are required to display an EPA label on the chassis and exhaust pipe. The label match-up program was designed as regulatory measure for states and municipalities to control motorcycle noise.\n\nCase Study\n\nNoise code legislation is designed to protect residents from noise pollution, but in Lancaster City, Pennsylvania, a motorcycle rights group essentially rewrote its noise code.\n\nThe noise code revision passed in 2007 shifted the focus from illegally modified exhaust systems and decibel levels to the intent of the motorcycle rider. It requires the police to make a subjective determination whether the noisy engine revving or hard acceleration was done intentionally or not.\n\nIn cases where there are groups of riders, a police officer have no means to determine which rider is intentionally making noise.\n\nRick Gray, the mayor of Lancaster City, introduced the revised noise code. He is also the former chairman of the American Motorcyclist Association. Harley-Davidson Motor Company operates its largest manufacturing facility near the city.\n\nZoning\n\nZoning is a system used in land-use regulation by an urban planning commission. It is intended as public policy that defines and prohibits land-use that harms existing residents or businesses in a given area.\n\nTypically, areas are broken into sectors such as industrial, commercial, residential, farming with specific conditions for its use. Some areas are designated mixed-use that may allow light commercial and residential to share the same space. Some communities are incorporated that gives them the legal authority to change zoning rules. A zoning variance is a special waiver that allows the property owner to conduct activities that would not otherwise be allowed.\n\nThere are numerous cases where homeowners build motocross tracks or riding trails on their property that adversely affect neighbors. In California, frustrated residents successfully lobbied the Riverside Board of Supervisors for effective legislation that would limit the use of noisy off-road vehicles on private land. Supporters testified that they had become hostages in their own homes to neighbors who set up illegal dirt tracks in their backyards and rode motorcycles for hours at a time.\n\nA common zoning issue is when industrial or commercial businesses borders a residential area without consideration for noise emissions."}

It is a very effective and efficient biodegrading plant. It eats what it grows on and gives off gas as a waste product. You recognize this as a musty smell. There are over 250,000 species of mold. Different species will biodegrade different substances.\n\nMold can grow in many colors, but frequently it is black. Mold is a necessary part of nature's plan. If we didn't have mold, we would have dead leaves half way to the moon by now. The plant consists of two parts. First, the main body of the plant known as the hypha, is the ugly substance on your walls. Second, there are the microscopic spores on top that the plant uses to proliferate its growth by spreading them like plant seeds.\n\nSince the plants don't like to share their space with other species, they will also emit spores to snuff out any other competing spores that happened to settle in on their field of growth. Air movement can also cause spores to spread.\n\nThis is where the bad aspect of mold comes in. There are two categories of mold spores that a person may have to contend with. The first is labeled as an irritant. You don't see them being breathed in, but your body knows that they are in your lungs. This causes your system to begin an immune function. This is so you can flush them out of your body. You will cough, your eyes will tear, and your nose will run. You may also get a headache. This is mostly from your sinuses dealing with the spores.\n\nWhen this happens, most people think that they have acquired a cold or flu. The difference is that the symptoms will not go away as long as you are exposed to the spores. Another sign of this is that the nasal drainage will be clear instead of yellow. This problem will get more serious after prolonged exposure, because the immune system will weaken from being over worked. You will be more susceptible to opportunistic illnesses.\n\nThe second category of mold spore is more dangerous. They are called pathogenic spores. They give off mycotoxins that cause neurological damage to the body. They will cause early dementia or memory loss or in the case of a child they can cause mental developmental problems. Fortunately, these spores are in the minority. They are a very hearty spore. It takes them over ten days to grow, and the environment needs to be dark and very wet. The problems that these spores cause have been highly exploited in the media.\n\nThe media would suggest that mold is deadly. This causes many people to panic when they see anything that resembles black mold. The pathogens are rarely found in small areas on vertical walls. Those areas are not wet enough. They can be found inside of a wall that has a prolonged plumbing leak or any area that has been gushy wet for a long period of time.\n\nSmaller areas of mold can be cleaned with the use of commercially produced cleaners such as Microban or the use of household bleach. Be aware, however, that the chlorine from the bleach can cause sinus damage, when used in closed areas. Microban is much more people friendly to use. If you are in doubt as to which mold that you have in your home, then it would be a good idea to have it tested by a professional. Small areas of mold (under ten square feet) can readily be cleaned if it is just in a humid or lightly damp area.\n\nIf the mold test proves the spores to be pathogenic, then they should be cleaned by a professional. Mold is a necessary part of nature's process, but we don't want it in our homes biodegrading things that we are not finished with yet, like our bodies.\n\nEnvirospect professionals are trained to provide the most thorough and comprehensive environmental inspection and testing available.

{"text":"Alanna Levine, a pediatrician in New York, sees plenty of children with persistent coughs and sneezes that result from poor indoor air quality.\n\nParents usually assume that their children are suffering from bacterial infections when the real culprit is closer to home: In fact, it is the home.\n\n\"It can take a long time to convince parents that their children could be coughing because they're allergic to something in the air in their bedrooms or living rooms,\" Levine says.\n\nIt could be as obvious as cigarette smoke or as hidden as mold or mildew. \"People develop allergies at all points in their lives,\" she says. \"For parents, realizing this can force them to make a big investment in changing the way they think.\"\n\nThe good news is that people can take simple steps to improve the air quality inside their homes. The bad news? The air quality in most residences is probably far worse than it is outside.\n\nLaura Dellutri, a home and lifestyle expert for The Daily Buzz, a syndicated morning TV show, points to a study from the Environmental Protection Agency that says air pollution is often two to five times worse indoors than it is outdoors.\n\n\"The air in your home is compromised by indoor air pollution minute by minute,\" says Dellutri, known as the Healthy Housekeeper on the show. \"When you walk in from a day outdoors, your clothes are covered in allergens, as is your hair. Add in a garage door left open and windows open, and allergens stay put in your home.\"\n\nFortunately, homeowners can take some simple steps to lessen or eliminate five common sources of indoor air pollution.\n\nCIGARETTE SMOKE: Levine points to cigarette smoke as the most irritating form of indoor air pollution.\n\nEliminating this is easy: Homeowners simply should never smoke inside their residences, she says. Cigarette smoke has a habit of lingering in a home's carpeting, bedding, furniture and walls.\n\nDUST MITES: Another common cause of poor indoor air quality is dust mites. These critters are microscopic. And it's not the mites themselves that cause people to sneeze, tear up or cough\u2014it's the excrement they leave behind. These dust mite pellets trigger asthma and allergy symptoms. Because they can't be seen, dust mites enjoy living in bedding, stuffed animals and furniture, undetected by homeowners.\n\nOne way homeowners can cut down on this microscopic population is by keeping their residence's humidity levels between 30 to 50 percent with a good humidifier. Homeowners also can cover their beds and box springs with allergen-proof coverings.\n\nPETS: Pets, too, are a common cause of indoor air pollution. The best solution is often a painful one; those who are allergic to pets, or who have children who are, might have to part with their furry companions.\n\nIf the allergies aren't too severe, pet owners can lessen the allergic impact by making sure their pets stay off the furniture and beds and by bathing them more frequently.\n\nMOLD\/MILDEW: Tony Abate, vice president of operations at AtmosAir Solutions in Fairfield, Conn., says that mold and mildew can cause air quality problems.Mold and mildew usually pop up because of moisture problems, so it's important to keep homes dry, especially in basements, crawl spaces and other areas susceptible to moisture.\n\nAbate, a certified indoor environmentalist, recommends that homeowners make sure their downspouts and gutters are working properly, that the grading of the land outside their homes slopes away from their residences and that they stock a dehumidifier in their basements.\n\nCARPET: Dick Gebhart, technology manager for Owens Corning, a global building-materials provider, points to carpeting as a fifth culprit. Carpeting can prove an irresistible home to dust mites and chemicals that cause people to sneeze and cough. \"I don't think a lot of people are aware of indoor air pollution. They think that air pollution comes from the outside,\" Gebhart says. \"They don't think about the impact that their furniture, their carpeting or even their electronic devices have on the quality of the air inside their homes.\"\n\nGebhart recommends that homeowners replace old carpeting. They also can invest in a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air\u2014HEPA\u2014filter. This filter prevents vacuums from kicking up an abundance of dust.\n\nHomes are built differently today, Abate says. Construction is tighter. This means that indoor air pollution is a more serious problem: Tighter homes increase the chances for mold, and they make it less likely that odors and allergens will simply drift away.\n\nThis is why it's so important for homeowners to take the relatively simple steps to eliminate the most common sources of indoor air pollution.\n\n\"Things are getting bottled up and concentrated in new homes,\" Abate says. \"A lot of people find that they feel better when they leave their homes.\"\n\nBefore You Lay Your Head Down\n\nHomeowners can provide relief for family members with allergies by purchasing anti-allergy bedding and pillows. Here's a three-step guide to purchasing these bedding materials:\n\n1. Nonporous fabrics provide the best protection against allergens, though some complain that these fabrics also become overly hot. Microfiber polyester fabrics also will do the job and usually provide a more comfortable sleeping environment. A tightly woven cotton fabric also is a good choice. The good news is that manufacturers are happy to advertise when their bedding products qualify as anti-allergy, so they aren't too difficult to find.\n\n2. Homeowners who purchase anti-allergy sheets and coverings should make sure that these products completely cover beds. This includes not only the mattress, but a bed's box springs and pillows.\n\n3. Homeowners shouldn't dampen the effectiveness of their anti-allergy bedding by making the mistake of letting their pets sleep on the beds that these coverings are protecting. Pets are a prime source of allergies in a home.\n\nHVAC Basics\n\nChemicals and sprays may help to clean household surfaces, but they can also irritate children and adults who suffer from allergies.\n\nThat's why Dick Gebhart, technology manager for Owens Corning, recommends that homeowners seeking to boost the air quality of their homes focus on HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) systems.\n\nBy regularly changing the filters in their HVAC systems and scheduling routine maintenance, homeowners can ensure that their indoor air is as pure as possible, says Tony Abate of AtmosAir Solutions.\n\nAnd for those times for when cleaners are a must\u2014everyone needs to clean toilet bowls, counter tops and floors, after all\u2014Laura Dellutri, the Healthy Housekeeper for The Daily Buzz TV, recommends that homeowners look for cleaners that don't use bleaches, phosphates, chlorine and ammonia. There are plenty of natural products on the market that don't contain these chemicals, and instead rely on baking soda, soap and borax.\n\nChoosing the Right Vacuum\n\nVacuuming rugs and furniture is a key component to boosting the quality of indoor air. Unfortunately, many vacuum cleaners kick up dust as they work, making life miserable for residents with allergies.\n\nThis is why home experts, including Dr. Alanna Levine, a pediatrician in New York, and Laura Dellutri, the Healthy Housekeeper for The Daily Buzz TV, recommend that homeowners use a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filter.\n\nThe government requires HEPA filters to remove 99.7 percent of all particles that are greater in size than 0.3 micrometers. A HEPA air filter can capture dust mite pellets and other allergens. It's important, though, for HEPA vacuum cleaners to release all of the air sucked into them through the HEPA filter."}
{"text":"Region 8 IAQ Champions\n\nColorado\n\nAdams Twelve Five Star Schools successfully bargained with the teachers union to implement standard procedures (such as phasing out volatile organic compound-based cleaning supplies) to ensure indoor air quality issues are handled expeditiously in their school district. To solidify the level of trust with teachers and parents, the district uses various communications methods, from the school cable channel to bulletin boards, to keep the community informed. Sharing their experience through the Colorado Association of School Executives, they serve as mentors to other schools within the state.\n\nKing-Murphy Elementary, Clear Creek School District, Evergreen, Colo.\n\nDistrict school administrators in 1998 learned of IAQ Tools for Schools guidance through a teacher who was concerned about air quality problems at school. The District utilized the resources in the IAQ Tools for Schools Kit and with the assistance of EPA Region 8, began tackling the poor indoor air issues identified by the IAQ Team. The foundation of the District's IAQ management program began with the implementation of a pilot program at King-Murphy Elementary Schools that led to significant and rapid indoor air improvements.\n\nMontana\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan Public School District, Mandan, N.D.\n\nMandan Public School District first learned of IAQ Tools for Schools guidance from the American Lung Association of North Dakota, who conducted an information session for the district superintendent and several principals. Team leaders and volunteer staff completed checklists during walkthroughs and prepared an action plan to prioritize building repairs. The district identified three key problem areas: general cleaning practices, ventilation, and thermal comfort, which resulted in the suggested implementation of several low-cost solutions, including repairing air handling systems, replacing air filters regularly, using HEPA filter vacuum cleaners, cleaning floor drains and dry sink drains weekly, and landscaping grounds to divert water drainage from building foundations. Team leaders developed news releases and provided them to local media to share information on the district's successful IAQ program. Mandan Public School District continues to sustain their comprehensive IAQ management program based off the IAQ Tools for Schools guidance and uses the IAQ action plan to identify solutions and make repairs.\n\nSt. Mary's Central High School, Bismarck, N.D.\n\nIn October 2000, St. Mary's Central High School began using the IAQ Tools for Schools Kit to identify IAQ concerns and set priorities. Using checklists, IAQ team volunteers discovered the foundation surrounding the music room had settled and cracked, letting water seep through. The school used its own funds plus donations to fix the problem and replace the carpet. The school carried out numerous repairs and upgrades to the kitchen and dining areas based on evidence collected through the checklists. St. Mary's made good progress in a short time and continues to share its experiences with other schools.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City Area School District No. 51-4 (RCAS) exemplifies the importance of resourceful champions in producing results, especially given the fact that the district experienced no IAQ crisis. Leah Lutheran addressed IAQ as a private citizen, and was elected to the school board in 1998. Since that time, RCAS has mainstreamed IAQ into daily policies and procedures and has drawn upon a variety of available resources. The South Dakota Lung Association provided the district with their initial IAQ Tools for Schools Kits. A grant from the American Association of School Administrators allowed a six-member delegation to attend the IAQ Tools for Schools Symposium in 2002. EPA's Region 8 office awarded Rapid City a grant and they were instrumental in assisting with the implementation of the IAQ Tools for Schools guidance in the school district. EPA's Region 8 office also sponsored a workshop for administrators, nurses and custodial staff. Two schools that performed HVAC system upgrades documented a decline in absenteeism of almost five percent.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City School District maintains high standards of indoor air quality through an extremely thorough set of policies and a simple proactive plan. The district has implemented guidelines and policies to ensure proper maintenance of mechanical systems and school facilities. Careful logs of maintenance efforts are documented as part of the preventive maintenance policy. IAQ Tools for Schools has played a vital role in shaping their program.

{"text":"You may not be familiar with the Illinois Pollution Control Board, but they have a lot of power to decide what goes into your lungs. They'll hold a hearing August 1st to consider Ameren's request to renege on a deal the company made to reduce pollution from their aging fleet of Illinois coal plants.\n\nBack in 2006 Ameren Illinois, along with other utilities, agreed to a compromise on new mercury pollution standards for coal power plants. They would be allowed to follow a less stringent standard on lowering Mercury pollution, and in exchange for that leniency, they agreed to lower levels of other poisonous air pollutants (SO2 and NOx). Ameren helped to negotiate the agreement and celebrated it as a victory for clean air.\n\nSix years later, Ameren has decided that they don't like the deal anymore. They want to continue releasing the higher levels of Mercury pollution but without making the SO2 reductions on the timetable they agreed to. In other words, they want to release more of a pollutant that causes birth defects and learning disabilities in children, AND they also want to release more of a pollutant that causes asthma attacks and aggravates heart disease. It must be because they love their customers so much!\n\nAn objection filed by several environmental groups put it this way: \"Ameren now wants to have its cake and eat it, too; it reaped the benefit of less stringent mercury standards for years but wants that benefit without meeting the prescribed SO2 limits.\"\n\nAmeren opted into the agreement that required reductions of SO2 in 2015 and 2017. Now, they're proposing a five-year delay to 2020 and 2021. Those far-off dates are additionally significant because there's no certainty that all of Ameren's aging Illinois coal fleet will even remain in operation that long.\n\nAll of the reasons why Ameren seeks an extension for reducing SO2 (low energy prices, new federal regulation, cost of compliance, competition from natural gas) are also reasons why they may choose to retire additional plants within the next five to ten years. It's fair to ask Ameren whether they will continue seeking extensions in an effort to run out the clock and avoid making new investments in their outdated plants before shutting them down.\n\nIf Ameren does choose to install pollution controls, there's a good chance Illinois taxpayers will pick up part of the tab. The Coal Development Fund of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity brags of having the largest coal subsidy program of any state in the nation. Ameren has a long history of asking Illinois taxpayers to help pay for the cost of doing business, while Ameren keeps the profit for themselves. For example, Ameren received $850,000 in 2002 to reduce SO2 at their Coffeen plant.\n\nAmeren claims poverty but they're really making a choice about their priorities. They're choosing to prioritize short-term profit over public safety. They're deciding that paying stock dividends is more important than reducing the number of asthma attacks their plants cause. That reducing birth defects and learning disabilities in newborns is less important than pumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into their political funds every year. That keeping outdated coal plants running for a few more years is a better option than building new clean energy sources that won't contribute to climate change. Those choices reveal their values and priorities as a company.\n\nEnvironmental groups are especially concerned about this case because it could set a precedent for other coal plant operators making the same request to delay installing pollution controls they previously agreed to.\n\nYou can let the Pollution Control Board know you want them to force Ameren to stick to their agreement at a public hearing Wednesday, August 1, 10:00am, in the Illinois Pollution Control Board Hearing Room, 1021 N. Grand Avenue East, North Entrance, Springfield. You can also submit comments as a member of the public if you can't attend the hearing. If you're in Chicago you can even take a bus ride to the hearing with Greenpeace and ELPC.\n\nThe decision on Ameren's request will have a major impact on whether Illinois embraces a clean energy future. Now is the time to speak up!\n\nCompanies do this sort of thing all the time, and it's understandable that they would try, but of course the negative consequences of these pollutants is far too important to ignore. I hope people will attend the public hearing and push back.\n\nOn a side note; I rarely think about what I did in college, but one of my coop jobs was working at the National Magnet Laboratory at MIT. What does this have to do with coal? Well, we were working on converting the sulfur contained in the coal into a magnetically susceptible compound that could later be magnetically separated by running a coal slurry through an electromagnet. It was an expensive power consuming process (we used heat or microwave energy to convert the compound) so that's why you don't hear much about it. I also gave a presentation on acid rain in one of my classes"}

{"text":"Toxic air pollutants found around school\n\nPreliminary tests of air outside Chicora School of Communications in North Charleston identified several toxic chemicals, including one that in a more potent form was used as a chemical weapon in World War I.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is monitoring air outside 63 schools in 22 states to find out whether children are being exposed to dangerous levels of toxic chemicals on a regular basis. Chicora is the only school in South Carolina being tested.\n\nRead more\n\nIn a news release Thursday describing its preliminary findings, the EPA said it found low levels of acrolein, benzene, chromium, manganese and several other chemicals in the air. None of the samples showed levels that present an immediate danger.\n\nHowever, levels of acrolein were in a range that EPA officials said merit further study. Acrolein is a pollutant that can irritate people's eyes, nose and throats. People with asthma and allergies are particularly sensitive to the chemical. It comes from industries, trucks, boats and other sources, and in higher concentrations, it was used as a chemical weapon in World War I.\n\nThe EPA found levels outside the school ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 micrograms per cubic meter of air. The EPA considers 7 micrograms a danger when people are exposed for just a short period. At levels between 7 micrograms and .02 micrograms, people might see effects if they're exposed to the chemical for long periods, said Dawn Harris-Young, an EPA spokesman in Atlanta.\n\n\"We're trying to get a better handle on the concentrations and what those health effects might be,\" she said. The EPA said in several statements that the results shouldn't prompt parents to switch schools, or keep children indoors. Indoor levels of air pollutants often are the same as outdoor levels.\n\nThe EPA began testing schools after a USA Today investigation last year found air outside hundreds of schools in South Carolina and elsewhere with high levels of toxic chemicals. Dubbed \"The Smokestack Effect,\" the newspaper's report gave particularly bad air pollution grades to Chicora School of Communications (formerly Chicora Elementary), Mary Ford Elementary, Charlestowne Academy, Academic Magnet High and North Charleston High.\n\nOnly 168 schools out of more than 120,000 had worse air than what's outside Chicora, the newspaper found. It said the two most prevalent pollutants near the North Charleston schools were manganese, which can cause mental disturbances and physical problems, and chromium compounds, which can cause numerous health issues.\n\nChicora is in a low-income neighborhood near the old Navy base. The EPA selected the school for monitoring because it's in an urban area with emissions from a mix of large and small industries, vehicles and other sources.\n\nThe USA Today series mostly used data and computer models to identify schools with high levels of toxic chemicals.\n\nThe EPA's preliminary results released Thursday validated those results and residents' concerns about air pollution, said Nancy Vinson of the Coastal Conservation League, an environmental group that's challenging the State Ports Authority's plan to build a new container terminal in the area.\n\nShe said that unless the ports authority takes steps to reduce pollution, the terminal would only add to the area's already intolerable air pollution situation. \"We can have a green port,\" she said.\n\n\"Safety is the Charleston County District's highest priority,\" said Susan Smyre Haire, the district's communications officer, adding that school leaders are working closely with state environmental officials and industry representatives on the air-pollution"}

Human activity,\nit seems, destroys negative ions which affect the oxygen that we breathe\nand the mind. It seems that when it comes to air, the more negatively\ncharged it is, the better. Smoke, dust, smog, pollutants, electrical\nemissions, heating systems, coolers and traffic are all culprits.\nThe air becomes more highly electrified (too many positive ions) and\nhumans react. Studies suggest between 57-85% of the population is\nstrongly affected and can gain dramatically from more negative ions.\n\nThe impact of negatively charged air\non the body is powerful.

The focus of\nthis section is on the programs of the\nDivision of Air Pollution Control which is\nresponsible for developing, implementing\nand enforcing regulations to assure that the\nair we breathe is clean and healthful. This\nmission is accomplished by finding,\ncorrecting and controlling air pollution\nhazards. The Division of Air Pollution\nControl also works to prevent air quality\nproblems from occurring in areas which\nhave clean air.\nThe basic strategy to improve air quality is\nto control the pollutants which are emitted\nby industry and motor vehicles. This\nstrategy requires the IEPA to monitor the\nair, identify emission sources, impose\nlimitations on the amount of emissions\nwhich can be released to the air and take the\nnecessary enforcement action against\nviolators.\nThe Division of Air Pollution Control is\ndivided into five sections: Air Monitoring,\nAir Quality Planning, Compliance and\nEnforcement, Permits, and Field\nOperations. Each of these sections is\nbriefly described below.\nAir Monitoring\nThe Division of Air Pollution Control\noperates a statewide air quality monitoring\nnetwork which includes more than 200\nmonitors. The Air Monitoring Section is\nresponsible for the maintenance of this\nnetwork, which operates year round\nmonitoring the quality of the air that we\nbreathe.\nThe IEPA monitors the air for a variety of\npollutants including particulate matter,\nsulfur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide,\nlead and nitrogen dioxide. Specialized\nsampling projects for other hazardous\npollutants are also conducted by the Air\nMonitoring Section.\nIllinois residents can be proud of the IEPA's\nrecord of efficiency in data collection. The\nsystem ranks as one of the best in the nation\nwith over 90 percent efficiency in the\ncollection of high quality data. This high\nefficiency rate guarantees that the network\nis operating with a minimum amount of\n\"down-time\" thereby providing the IEPA\nwith a complete and accurate description of\nair quality in Illinois.\nThe Air Monitoring Section is also\nresponsible for validating and summarizing\nthe data in this report. It provides\nnotification of air quality exceedances and\nissues any episodes as required. Special air\nquality studies are performed which\nidentify pollution trends and evaluate\nspecial air quality problems.\nAir Quality Planning\nThe Air Quality Planning Section is\nresponsible for developing Agency\nprograms which are designed to achieve\nand maintain National Ambient Air Quality\nStandards and to prevent deterioration of air\nquality. This is accomplished by:\n\uf0b7 Assessment of strategies and\ntechnologies for the elimination or\nreduction of air pollutant emissions.\n\uf0b7 Conducting and reviewing detailed\nair quality studies using\ncomputerized air quality models.\n\nClick tabs to swap between content that is broken into logical sections."}

But according to The World's Worst Polluted Places \u2014 The Top Ten (59 pages, PDF), a new report from the Blacksmith Institute, the most polluted sites are not widely known, even in their own countries. In an effort to prioritize sites for remediation, the report weighs polluted locations by size of the affected population, severity of the toxins involved, impact on children's health and development, evidence of a clear contamination pathway, and reliable evidence of a deleterious health impact."}
{"text":"As Everyone Looks Down at What Gulf Oil Spill Has Wrought, UC Irvine Researchers Look Up\n\nBut researchers from UC Irvine are not looking at the sands, shorelines and waters impacted by the muck, they are checking out the air hovering over the spill zone.\n\nThe initial findings: all is not well.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Stephen Lehmann\n\nA plane drops dispersant in ocean waters contaminated by the gulf oil spill.\n\n\u200b\"Record levels of potentially harmful chemicals have been detected by\nUC Irvine researchers in the air around the BP oil spill in the Gulf of\nMexico,\" began a June 25 UCI Today report. \"While the findings are preliminary, they illustrate a critical\nneed for further testing.\"\n\nThat was written by Janet Wilson, the former Times Orange County environmental reporter who\nrecently contributed articles and blog posts to the Weekly before joining the University Communications office.\n\n\"There are lots of hydrocarbons\nrising from all this muck,\" Donald Blake, the chairman of UCI's chemistry department, tells Wilson. \"What we don't know is whether this air came from somewhere else\nor is bubbling up from below.\"\n\nThe piece goes on to report that Blake and Nobel laureate chemist\nF. Sherwood Rowland were poring over data collected from air samples contained in 400 canisters. But their initial findings discovered concentrations of certain chemicals exceeding any they've found\nbefore, including over Mexico City, Oklahoma oil tank farms\nand other heavily polluted urban areas like Los Angeles.\n\nIt was unclear at that time whether the alkyl nitrates, methane, and hexane and butane compounds the pair identified could be from oil rising to the surface, the dispersant used\nto break it up or other unknown sources.\n\nExposure to the stuff can lead to eye and skin irritation and burns, dizziness and even suffocation.\n\nBoth eggheads expressed frustration over insufficient funding and government\ncoordination of air testing above the massive slick.\n\nBarbara\nBarletta, a UCI chemistry special assistant, seconds that emotion in an Orange County Register post today.\n\nShe is also quick to reiterate that air research over the spill area is still in the very early stages, and that data is still being interpreted.\n\nBut, so far, traces of the material that makes up\ncrude oil--long-chain hydrocarbons, as well as aromatic compounds,\nsuch as benzene, toluene, and xylene, all known carcinogens--have been found there, according to Barletta.\n\nWith more funding, the researchers say, they can continue\nmonitoring the air and watching for increases or decreases in airborne\nhazardous chemicals, which can then reported to the EPA.\n\nAnd then, hopefully, taken out of BP's ass--that is, if multinational oil conglomerates have asses."}
{"text":"The Earth's protective ozone layer is getting thinner. There's less ozone to absorb harmful radiation from the sun, and more of this radiation is reaching the Earth's surface. This affects our atmosphere \u2013 and our health.\n\nOzone is a form of oxygen. It generally forms when oxygen (O2) from near the Earth's surface drifts high up into the atmosphere. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun hits the oxygen molecules.\n\nSome molecules split apart, creating single atoms. These atoms sometimes link up with O2 molecules, forming a new molecule with three oxygen atoms. That's ozone (O3).\n\nOzone can be helpful or harmful, depending on where it's located. If it's high up, it's good ozone. Ozone in the stratosphere protects people, animals, and plants from harmful ultraviolet rays.\n\nIn 1985 scientists found a large ozone hole in the stratosphere over Antarctica. Each year the hole became bigger, letting more ultraviolet light through to the Earth's surface. This situation is called stratospheric ozone depletion (SOD). Without the protection provided by ozone, we face a number of health problems.\n\nThe Other Face of Ozone\n\nOzone high in the stratosphere is good, but ozone near the ground is not. Do you ever hear \"ozone warnings\" on the weather report? Ozone can be very unhealthy.\n\nInhaling ozone can damage the respiratory tract, which enables us to breathe. Ozone also stunts plant growth. That hurts farmers, agriculture, and our economy.\n\nUp in the stratosphere, ozone (O3) acts as a natural sunscreen to protect us against ultraviolet (UV) radiation. That's the stuff that gives us sunburns. Because of the ozone layer, most of the harmful radiation never reaches Earth. But, as more and more of it does, we're at greater risk for skin and eye problems.\n\nPeople living near the Equator should be just as concerned about sun damage as people living where the ozone layer is thinning. The higher the sun is in the sky, the greater the direct sunlight reaching the Earth. Staying out of the sun when it is directly overhead (around noon hours), putting on sunscreen, and wearing a hat will help protect you.\n\nWhat's a \"hot spot\"?\n\nThe thinning of the ozone layer is not evenly spread around Earth. \"Hot spots\" are holes near the North and South Poles. People living in areas near the North and South Poles \u2013 including New Zealand, Australia, and the southern part of South America \u2013 are at extra risk of being harmed by ultraviolet radiation."}

It's also chemically inert. Unless you test for it, there is no way to know whether radon is present in your home\u2014but high concentrations have been found in every state in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency's <a href=\" Guide to Radon<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How Does Radon Get Into Your Home?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nRadon occurs naturally in the environment through chemical processes in the decay of radioactive materials like uranium, which is found in some soil and rock strata worldwide. Radon gas present in the soil or rock can leak into both water and air, becoming concentrated in local water sources and the enclosed spaces inside buildings.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Why Is Radon a Concern?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nRadon can further break down into elements called radon \"progeny\" or \"daughters.\" These progeny are particles, not gas like the parent element. They can attach to dust and other airborne particulates and be breathed into the lungs, where they lodge and continue their radioactive decay. That's why radon is a leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S., second only to smoking\u2014according to the American Cancer Society's online <a href=\" Fact Sheet<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\nRadon and its daughter elements also give off alpha particles, which are highly radioactive and can damage human DNA over time\u2014not just in the lungs. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Toxicology Program, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer all identify radon as a known carcinogen that can cause cancer in humans.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keep Your Loved Ones Safe.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nRadon is a known carcinogenic substance that is impossible to detect without chemical testing. It's prevalent in indoor environments throughout the country. Even if your neighbors know their levels of radon are within safe levels, yours may not be\u2014it depends on the composition of soil and underground substrates beneath your house and in the surrounding area.<\/p>\n<p>\nNext time, we'll cover radon testing to help you keep the ones you love safe from this toxic substance.<\/p>\n<p>\n<emem><\/p>Thu, 13 Jun 2013 20:03:31 +0000\n Your Home Picture Perfect For Sale<p> actually is.<\/p>\n<p>\nCluttered book shelves, walls filled with trinkets and tiny photographs, or desks and tables piled with knick-knacks can make a home feel disorganized and out of date. Remove as much clutter as possible to make your home feel light and fresh. If your house feels bland, add a few striking pieces of d\u00e9cor to each room. Don't overdo it with piecemeal, cluttered decorations.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Benefits of Fresh Paint<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nA fresh coat of paint is the perfect way to update both the inside and outside of your home before placing it on the market. Choose light, fresh colors that correspond to current trends. Variations on taupe and gray are perfect for the interior of your home. On the outside, consider choosing a neutral main color and accenting it with another, bolder, color. This will help the home stand out while still keeping it in the tone of your neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>If In Doubt, Go Neutral<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nOne common mistake that homeowners make when they put their houses on the market is failing to remove some of the more glaring personal touches that they have added to their home through the years. You may love the mural of Tuscany painted on your dining room wall or the bright orange hue featured in your guest bathroom, but these dramatic personal choices can make it difficult for interested buyers to visualize themselves living in your home. Your goal, as a seller, should be to remove as much of your own personality as possible from your home. Try to present a clean slate to interested buyers, and allow those who view your home to visualize their own tastes and preferences.<\/p>\n<p>\nSelling a home can be a tough task, and many homeowners are easily frustrated with the seemingly endless home viewings, tours, and meetings. A few aesthetic changes, though, may be all that is needed to transform visitors from \"passers\" into eager buyers.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br43:22 +0000\n Perfect Open House<p>\nBefore a buyer makes a decision on your home, he or she will likely want to attend an open house event. Here are a few steps you can take to make your open house a perfect marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Stay Away During the Open House<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nOne important thing to remember when your real estate agent is hosting an open house is to stay away during the event. Nothing deters interested buyers from asking important questions or taking the time to explore the home thoroughly than a homeowner lurking in the vicinity. Your real estate agent can handle the open house, putting your best foot forward when he or she greets potential buyers and answers questions about your home.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pleasant Aromas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nOne of the first things that interested buyers will notice upon entering your home is the smell. A bad aroma such as mold, mildew, or pet odors can create a lasting negative impression for the house as a whole. You can solve this problem by lighting scented candles, investing in odor eliminating spray or antibacterial spray, or purchasing air fresheners that plug into your home's wall outlets. A real estate agent trick that is commonly used to create a pleasant home aroma is to place a few drops of vanilla extract and cinnamon in a baking dish in your oven. As the vanilla and cinnamon become warm, a delicious and inviting smell will drift through your home.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Right Lighting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nThe right lighting can make a huge difference in the overall appearance of your home's interior. If the open house is during daylight hours, be sure that blinds and window coverings are drawn back and raised to allow natural light to filter into your house. If the open house is at night, turn on the lights in your home to illuminate the space. Pay special attention to dark corners within your house. A lamp in a gloomy area can enliven the space and make it feel inviting.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Getting Visitor Information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nIt's also crucial to collect visitor information from those who stop by your open house. Your real estate agent should record contact information for interested home buyers, and will be able to make follow-up calls or send follow-up emails. Often, this secondary contact can help convince a buyer to take a second look at your home. Even if they are not interested in purchasing your house, visitors can provide your agent with important feedback that can help you to better market your home going forward. <\/p>\n<p>\nThe open house is a crucial part of the sale process, so it's important to invest some time and energy into making the walk-through event as seamless and beneficial as possible. Together with your real estate agent aim to create an environment that will make your buyer feel comfortable41:18 +0000\n to Market Your \"For Sale\" Home<p>\nPutting your house on the market can be frustrating and exhausting. Homes can stay on the market for months before an interested buyer takes notice. You can expedite the process, however, by employing a few basic marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Why Market Your Home?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nMarketing your home is the most effective way to get the word out that you are a seller in search of a buyer. In some locations, the market may be flooded with homeowners attempting to sell their homes. Unless you use some basic marketing strategies, your home may not get the recognition it needs to attract interested parties to open houses, walk-throughs, or other important parts of the selling process. Marketing doesn't have to be expensive or complicated, but it does need to occur in order for your home to sell quickly. Working with a real estate agent who is experienced and progressive in marketing can help you sell more quickly, achieve a higher sales price, and reduce the stress of selling your home.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Online Advertisement Forums<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nThe Internet is one of the most effective ways to market your home when you're ready to put it up for sale. Thousands of consumers may search the Internet to find homes for sale in your area. Your real estate agent should post information about your home on a number of real estate websites, often by using a multiple listing service. They might also use their social media pages to share your listing with a wide range of friends and contacts. One benefit of online marketing is that it is usually free. All it takes is a small time investment to get the information about your house in a location where interested parties can see it.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Prominent Signage<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAnother effective, and low-cost, way to market your home's status on the market is to feature a prominent sign in front of your home. Many consumers find their future home by driving through the neighborhoods in which they are interested. If your home has a large \"For Sale\" sign, it will attract attention. Be sure that contact information is clearly printed on the sign and talk with your agent about the possibility of adding a custom sign rider that includes a website address or QR code that will take interested passersby directly to your online listing for more information.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Real Estate Agents<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nHiring a real estate agent is, of course, one of the simplest ways to market your home. An agent will handle the bulk of the marketing on your behalf because he or she stands to make a profit only after your home is sold. But real estate agents also have websites, industry contacts, and relationships with consumers that can help you find the right buyer more quickly. In addition, their market knowledge and negotiating experience can help you achieve the best sales price for your home. All of these are indispensable when selling a homeTue, 21 May 2013 16:59:04 +0000\n Buyers & Sellers Impressed by Dwell360's Real Estate Classes<p>\nDwell360's Home Buying &amp; Selling Classes on May 11 were a great success!<\/p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"Dwell360 Class Photos\" src=\" style=\"height: 400px; width: 580px;\"><\/p>\n<p>\nParticipants were excited to cover the basics of home buying and selling, but also surprised to learn about the changes in the current market and some insider secrets as well.

Finding this charming house, though, often requires a not-so-charming process. If you are a first-time home buyer, consider this short list of do's and don'ts that will help you do the right things while avoiding common first-timer mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Your Research<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nFirst, it is crucial that home buyers do a great deal of research before they start hitting the streets and viewing open houses. Research the housing markets in your area, and compare markets to one another. Evaluate school systems, proximity to amenities and important highways, information about builders and contractors, and the years in which houses were built. The more information about a housing market you have in advance, the less likely you are to make a buying mistake.<\/p>\n<p>\nIt's also important to research information about a home mortgage and prepare your financing in advance. The financing process can take several months, so you should have your money in place before you begin your search.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Hire a Professional<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAnother suggested \"do\" for first-time home buyers is to hire a professional. A real estate agent can evaluate your needs and wants and help guide your search toward houses within your price range that better meet these needs. Agents can answer important home buyer and future homeowner questions, too.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Evaluate Your Wants vs. Needs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nOne mistake that many first-time home buyers make is blurring the distinction between wants and needs. Your list of needs should include only the essential amenities that a home must have. Your list of wants can be more extensive. You should prioritize a \"wants\" list from the most important to the least important, so you can decide what should be sacrificed when you begin looking at homes.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Don't Buy Too Much House<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nIt's crucial to purchase a house that you can afford. This involves more than just the price tag on a home. Remember, bigger houses come with more property taxes, more upkeep responsibilities, and more potential problems that can result in big costs in the future.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Don't Rush the Process<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nThe biggest \"don't\" in the home buying adventure is rushing the process. Never place an offer on the first home you see unless you have evaluated several other properties. Finding the balance between taking one's time and acting quickly to avoid losing out on a property can be difficult.

An open house is a pressure-free way for interested buyers to view your property and imagine themselves living in the space. An open house, however, is usually a very short event. Every single moment counts during an open house, and you need to be sure that your house impresses every step of the way. When you've perfected your home's curb appeal, the next step is to create an attractive and enticing foyer space. The foyer is the first part of your home's interior that interested buyers will view. While you don't need to knock down walls and spend a fortune creating a foyer that didn't exist before, you should spend some time evaluating the space you have and doing what you can to make it work.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Emphasize Large Spaces<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nIf your foyer is large and impressive, emphasize the vastness of the space. A large central table with a towering and colorful centerpiece is a dramatic way to emphasize a large foyer. You may also consider a floor length mirror resting in a corner of your foyer. The mirror will extend the vertical space of your foyer and also give guests a vision of themselves physically walking into your home. Tall paintings and photographs, newly polished chandeliers, and other large decorative items will also emphasize a large space.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Turn Cramped into Charming<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nIf your foyer is a little on the cramped size, use decorative elements to make the space feel charming rather than constrictive. A small antique sofa table pressed against the wall is a great place to display photographs and other d\u00e9cor without infringing on the available space. You can extend the perceived height of your foyer by adding wainscoting to the lower portion of the wall and painting the upper portion of the wall a contrasting color.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Make the Space Functional<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nFoyers are often perceived as transitional spaces, but you can add functionality to a foyer, too. A wall-length bench with storage and cushions is a great catch-all space for shoes, umbrellas, and coats. A line of shelving with hooks for coats and hats is also a great touch for your foyer.<\/p>\n<p>\nRemember that the foyer is the first look at your home's interior. Stand at your front door and evaluate your foyer with a fresh perspective. If something looks off to you, the homeowner, the odds are good that an interested buyer will also notice the problem. <\/ Boston and Newton Massachusetts. <\/span><a href=\" style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;Thu, 11 Apr 2013 18:25:15 +0000\n the Kitchen: Trends for 2013<p>\nToday's kitchen is a quick-change artist that adores families and loves simplicity.<\/p>\n<p>\nIf you're looking to remodel your kitchen, we've got good news and bad news.<br><br>\nFirst clever storage ideas.

Casual kitchens are trending, with doo-dads and gee-gaws (think elaborate trim and vent hoods that look like medieval castles) going away, and simpler, sleeker designs coming on strong.<\/p>\n<p>\nSpeaking on kitchen trends at the 2013 International Builder's Show in Las Vegas, interior designer Dirks and architect Tringali teamed up to describe the new American kitchen as one piece of a larger, open floor plan.<br>\n<br>\nIt's all part of a new kitchen gestalt that Dirks describes as the \"prep-eat-play\" triangle, with flexibility and casual living as key ingredients. The notion tosses the kitchen into a design blender along with living, dining, and family rooms, and frappes everything into communal happiness.<br><br>\nExample: You can eat at a comfy banquette, or in front of the TV (don't tell your child-development counselor), or in the breakfast nook, or you can belly up to the island. No rules!<br><br>\nThe bad news (OK, it's not that bad) is that we've heard some of this before. Open floor plans have been around since the moon landing and yes, we like them. A lot. What we really have here is affirmation \u2014 and freedom to create kitchens that are less ornate and yet have more personality.<br><br>\nJust like you.<br><br>\nOf course, Dirks and Trengali definitely have the pulse of today's home owner and offer some great takeaways. We've combined their goodies with our own kitchen trendspotting for 2013. If you're planning a kitchen redo, here's what you need to know: <br><br><strong>Contemporary kitchens are In. <\/strong>Specifically, they're getting simpler and more modern, with less elaborate detail and trim. In fact, the National Kitchen and Bath Association reports that in its annual survey of kitchen designers, \"transitional\" design \u2014 meaning a simple, more modern aesthetic \u2014 has surpassed \"traditional\" as the preferred design for the first time in the association's history.<br><br><strong>Kitchen cabinets are dark, or white. <\/strong>Darker, furniture-like finishes are popular, but so is pure white. The middle ground \u2014 think natural oak \u2014 is going away. Dark finishes help the kitchen integrate into the overall scheme; pure white is the ultimate accent color that readily complements the rest of the living area.<br><br><strong>Islands rule.<\/strong> Kitchen islands are becoming more multi-dimensional, serving as food-prep areas, snack stations, wine storage, and display cabinets for objets d'art. Also, they're essential for directing traffic flow within an open floor plan, channeling guests toward comfy seating areas, for example. Small kitchen? Go with a rolling cart that's there when you need it.<br><br><strong>Countertop revolution. <\/strong>Say hi to porcelain and ceramic slabs that look like stone, wood, and fabric, says Jamie Gold, a California designer. The product is made from clay, quartz, and feldspar that's subjected to high heat \u2014 just like regular tile. Unlike other engineered countertops, this product doesn't use cements or resin binders. It's not readily available in the U.S. yet.<br><br><strong>Appliances are disappearing.<\/strong> In the past, we loved our commercial-style kitchen appliances that made us look like we really knew how to cook. Now, appliances are hiding behind wood panels and faux veneers so they integrate better with the overall living space. New finishes, such as GE's slate and Whirlpool's Ice White, are bucking the stainless steel trend, but don't bet on stainless going away anytime soon \u2014 it's still hot.<br><br><strong>Espresso yourself.<\/strong> An eye-catching extra gives a kitchen a blast of personality. Cool sinks and high-tech faucets are au courant. Other possibilities include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nStylish vent hood.<\/li>\n<li>\nVentless fireplace.<\/li>\n<li>\nEspresso machine.<\/li>\n<li>\nOne-of-a-kind tiles as accents on kitchen backsplashes and countertops.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\n<strong>Glass finishes.<\/strong> Glistening glass is popping up everywhere in the kitchen, especially glass tiles installed as backsplashes. Applying clear glass panels over walls painted soft colors gives a deep sheen that harmonizes with today's contemporary looks. Bonus: It's easy toclean.<br><br><strong>Grab some fresh air. <\/strong>Outdoor kitchens and entertaining areas are hot. Your indoor kitchen should have an outdoor doppelganger close by, available through wide glass doors.<\/p>\n<p>\nBy: <a href=\" Riha<\/aFri, 08 Mar 2013 17:37:31 +0000\n Home Repairs to Tackle Before Selling Your House<p>\nBefore you sell your home in the Boston area, it's important to make a few cosmetic fixes. These five inexpensive home repairs will get your home in tip-top condition before you put it on the market.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>1. Wall Imperfections<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nOne of the first things you should do when preparing your house for the market is to repair wall imperfections. Cracks, chips, and nail holes are easy fixes. A touch of spackling and some sandpaper can restore a wall to its former smoothness. You can follow up on these repairs with a fresh coat of paint. More serious wall issues, like buckling or serious water damage, should be handled by a professional. The walls in your home are like a blank canvas. If they are marred by damage, a potential buyer may interpret this as signs of overall disrepair or neglect.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>2. Water Stains<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nWater stains, those unsightly brown circles on the ceiling or the trickling brown lines on your walls, are a huge red flag to interested home buyers. Even if the leak in your roof has been fixed for years, water stains can make a buyer feel panicky and uncertain. A coat of primer and a coat of paint are usually all that are required to remove these unsightly blemishes.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>3. Carpet Cleaning<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nIf your home is covered in wall to wall carpet, you will want to invest in a high quality carpet cleaner or the services of a professional before putting your home on the market. Carpet is tricky for home buyers because there are so many problems that are associated with carpet. Pet stains and odors, discoloration, or even differences in personal taste can cause issues. Choose a neutral carpet for your home, and be sure that it is spotlessly clean before showing your house.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>4. Leaky Faucets<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nA leaky faucet is one of the simplest home maintenance tasks to perform. As such, you might not expect that a leaky faucet would cause such a bad impression on an interested home buyer. The issue, however, is not with the leaky faucet itself but with the image a leaky faucet creates in the mind of the consumer. If your faucets are leaking, a buyer may wonder what other maintenance tasks have been neglected.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>5. Creaky Floors<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nIf your house is old, you may have a creaky floor problem. Some home buyers may think creaky floors are charming character aspects, but others associate floor creakiness with structural issues. Identify problem areas in your floor, and invest in the repair services of a professional.<\/p>\n<p>\nThe real estate market is a competitive environment and tackling these repairs prior to putting your home on the market is important. Massachusetts buyers will see that you cared for the home and see more value.<\/ Newton Massachusetts that <\/span><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;\">servicesWed, 20 Feb 2013 21:56:51 +0000\n Wanted - Administrative Assistant - Newton<p>\nDwell360 a boutique real estate brokerage is seeking an Administrative Assistant for their Newton headquarters.

Will you get audited if you take the home office deduction? Find out the answers to these questions and more before Tax Day.<\/p>\n<p>iling tips.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>HouseLogic: What's the most common home-related tax deduction or credit claimed by home owners?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAbe Schneier: The mortgage interest deduction, [which the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS\u00ae estimates amounts to about $3,000 in tax savings for the average itemizing home owner] and [the deduction for] real property taxes.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>HL: Which tax provision do home owners often overlook?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAS: [An area of tax-filing confusion is] whether you've correctly treated any points you paid if you refinanced. In a new home purchase, the points can be deducted [in the tax year you paid them]. But typically in a refinancing, you have to amortize and deduct any points you paid over the life of the mortgage, and people tend to forget that after a couple of years.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>HL: What's the No. 1 mistake home owners make when filing their taxes?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAS: Because you receive a statement from the bank with details [such as] how muchmortgage interest you paid over the year, and how much the bank pays on your behalf in real estate taxes, the number of mistakes has dropped.<\/p>\n<p>\nBut if you're in a state where you pay the real estate taxes on your own \u2014 the bank doesn't handle it for you \u2014 [people] make mistakes because sometimes real estate tax bills include other items besides pure real estate taxes. It could be trash collection fees; it could be snow removal fees that the state or county is assessing on the real estate tax bill. Since the items are included in the same bill, home owners sometimes deduct [those fees] regardless of whether the items are actually taxes.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>HL: What's the single most important piece of advice for people filing their taxes as a first-time home owner?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAS: You have to take a look at your closing statement from when you bought the house. It's commonly called the HUD-1 form and you receive it at the closing. Occasionally, there are fees such as prepaid taxes or interest at closing that can be deductible.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>HL: What tax advice do you have for someone who's owned their home for 10 or 20 years?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAS: If you've been a longtime home owner and you've been through refinancings, you have to be careful about how much interest you've deducted, especially if you have a home equity loan or equity line. A lot of people who've refinanced have sizable equity lines. The maximum outstanding home equity debt that's deductible is $100,000; the maximum deductible amount of interest paid on mortgage debt is $1 million.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>HL: What home improvement-related records should home owners keep?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAS: Absolutely keep your receipts for couple of reasons:<\/p>\n<p>\n1. You want to make sure \u2014 if there are any warranties attached to the work that was done \u2014 that you maintain those records and you have something to go back to the person who did the work in case something doesn't function properly.<\/p>\n<p>\n2. If you've added value to the home \u2014 you've added a deck, you've added a room, you've added something new to house \u2014 you'll need to know what the gain is on that capital improvement when you sell the house.<\/p>\n<p>\nHL note: Tax rules let you add capital improvement expenses to the cost basis of your home, and a higher cost basis lowers the total profit or capital gain you're required to pay taxes on. Of course, most home owners are exempted from taxes on the first $500,000 in profit for joint filers ($250,000 for single filers). So it doesn't apply to too many people.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>HL: How do I tell the difference between a capital improvement and a repair?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAS: Typically a repair is [done] to allow an item, like a home furnace or air conditioner, to continue. But if you were to replace the heating unit, that's not a repair.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>HL: Does taking any home-related tax benefits, such as the home office deduction, make a taxpayer more likely to be audited?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAS: Only if numbers look out of the ordinary \u2014 for instance, if one year you were writing off $20,000 in mortgage interest debt and the next year you're writing off $100,000 in mortgage interest. Taking the home office deduction in and of itself doesn't usually generate an audit. However, if you claim nominal income and significantly higher expenses in an effort to create artificial losses, the IRS will see that there's something else going on there.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>HL: Now that filing season for tax year 2012 is almost over, when should home owners start thinking about tax year 2013?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\nAS: Well, hopefully, when you visit your CPA to give information about or pick up your 2012 tax return, your CPA has spoken with you about your plans for 2013:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nIf any major improvements are scheduled<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nIf you're planning on moving<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nHow to organize any expenditures for fixing up the home before sale<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\nIf you're planning to do any of those things, talk with your CPA so that you're prepared with documentation and so that the [tax pro] can help minimize your tax situation.<\/p>\n<p>\nBy: <a href=\" Padgitt\"> 02 Jan 2013 17:20:15 +0000\n a toy for a chance to win an iPod Shuffle!<h3>\nDrop off a new, unwrapped toy for Toys for Tots at our office by December 17th and you can enter to win an Apple iPod Shuffle from Dwell360!<\/h3>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 200px; float: left;\"><\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nStop by Tuesdays through Fridays 9am - 5pm <\/p>\n<p>\nand on Monday December 17 from 10am - 5pm<\/p>\n<p>\nat 46 Austin Street in Newton.<\/p>\n<p>\nOne raffle entry per toy donated.

But, a session at the recent 2012 Remodeling Show in Baltimore clued me in as to why adding a few simple tasks to our remodeling plan could lower our home's energy bill, get rid of some of the annoying hot and cold spots in our house, and make our home less hospitable to mold and other allergens.<\/p>\n<p>\nCarl Seville, author of Green Building: Principles and Practices in Residential Construction, shared some simple, inexpensive ways to make remodels and additions more energy efficient from the standpoint of energy usage and conservation of resources.<\/p>\n<p>\nTry these eight tips from Seville:<\/p>\n<p>\n1. Check for water intrusion, condensation, and excess moisture before you begin the project. Fixing those issues during remodeling can improve your home's indoorair quality (excess moisture encourages mold).<\/p>\n<p>\n2. Use the least amount of framing allowed by your building code when adding walls. Not only will you have to pay for less lumber and fewer nails, the contractor will have more room to put insulation in your walls, making your home more energy efficient.<\/p>\n<p>\n3. Resist the urge to splurge on multiple shower heads. Opt for a single low-flow shower head rather than installing a car wash-style plethora of shower heads.<\/p>\n<p>\n4. If possible, add new HVAC ducts to parts of your home that are heated and cooled, rather than placing them in a space with unconditioned air (like the attic). If that's not possible, insulate the ducts. Have an HVAC diagnostician analyze your system to make sure it's sized correctly and balanced to properly exchange old and new air.<\/p>\n<p>\n5. Be sure to insulate around recessed lights that protrude into un-insulated attic spaces \u2014 these are major sources of air leaks.<\/p>\n<p>\n6. If you're wasting water, you're wasting energy. Look at high-efficiency or solarwater heaters, and insulate your water pipes. If you want hot water faster, move the water heater closer to the faucet or install demand pumps to drive hot water to the fixture.<\/p>\n<p>\n7. Install wall-mounted efficiency toggle switch plates for the outlets where you plug in your televisions and computers to make it easy to cut off the power to electronics you're not using.<\/p>\n<p>\n8. A humidistat that automatically turns on the bathroom fan when moisture rises beats depending on teenagers or tenants remembering to use the fan. Reducing bathroom moisture reduces the chances you'll have mold.<\/p>\n<p>\nWhen I pull the kitchen cabinets off the wall, I'm going to use caulk to seal between the wallboards and the floorboards before I put down new flooring and install the new cabinets. And since I'll have the caulk out, I'm going to seal the top of window trim, something my home's builder didn't do.<\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(127, 126, 126); font-family: arial, 'Helvetica Neue', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 15.716666221618652px; \">By: <\/span><a href=\" DeZube 07 Nov 2012 19:56:29 +0000\n Fall Festival<p>\nThanks for attending our Fall Festival Open House on October 28th! <\/p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\" style=\"width: 235px; height: 157px; border-width: 3px; border-style: solid;\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\" style=\"width: 235px; height: 157px; border-width: 3px; border-style: solid;\"><\/p>\n<p>\nOur Open House (\"Pre-Hurricane\" Party) was a fantastic success.

Kitchen remodeling: <\/h3>\n<p>\nInstead of being forced to eat out while your kitchen is being renovated, in the summer you can grill most of your meals.

Mortgages typically come in 15-, 20-, 30- or 40-year lengths. The longer the term, the lower your monthly payment. However, the tradeoff for a lower payment is that the longer the life of your loan, the more interest you'll pay.<br><br>\nMortgage interest rates generally come in two flavors: fixed and adjustable. A fixed rate allows you to lock in your interest rate for the entire mortgage term. That's attractive if you're risk-averse, on a fixed income, or when interest rates are low.<\/p>\n<h3>\nThe risks and rewards of ARMs<\/h3>\n<p>\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage does just what its name implies: Its interest rate adjusts at a future date listed in the loan documents. It moves up and down according to a particular financial market index, such as Treasury bills. A 3\/1 ARM will have the same interest rate for three years and then adjust every year after that; likewise a 5\/1 ARM remains unchanged until the five-year mark. Typically, ARMs include a cap on how much the interest rate can increase, such as 3% at each adjustment, or 5% over the life of the loan.<br><br>\nWhy agree to such uncertainty? ARMs can be a good choice if you expect your income to grow significantly in the coming years. The interest rate on some\u2014but not all\u2014ARMs can even drop if the benchmark to which they're tied also dips. ARMs also often offer a lower interest rate than fixed-rate mortgages during the first few years of the mortgage, which means big savings for you\u2014even if there's only a half-point difference.<br><br>\nBut if rates go up, your ARM payment will jump dramatically, so before you choose an ARM, answer these questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nHow much can my monthly payments increase at each adjustment?<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nHow soon and how often can increases occur?<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nCan I afford the maximum increase permitted?<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nDo I expect my income to increase or decrease?<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nAm I paying down my loan balance each month, or is it staying the same or even increasing?<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nDo I plan to own the home for longer than the initial low-interest-rate period, or do I plan to sell before the rate adjusts?<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nWill I have to pay a penalty if I refinance into a lower-rate mortgage or sell my house?<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nWhat's my goal in buying this property? Am I considering a riskier mortgage to buy a more expensive house than I can realistically afford?<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul><\/ul><h3>\nConsider a government-backed mortgage loan<\/h3>\n<p>\nIf you've saved less than the ideal downpayment of 20%, or your credit score isn't high enough for you to qualify for a fixed-rate or ARM with a conventional lender, consider a government-backed loan from the Federal Housing Administration or Department of Veterans Affairs. <br><br>\nFHA offers adjustable and fixed-rate loans at reduced interest rates and with as little as 3.5% down and VA offers no-money-down loans. FHA and VA also let you use cash gifts from family members.<br>\n<br>\nBefore you decide on any mortgage, remember that slight variations in interest rates, loan amounts, and terms can significantly affect your monthly payment.

New Guidelines Change the Game<p>\nBy lowering the acceptable levels of lead in blood, The Centers for Disease Control has renewed the assault on environmental lead, often found in paint in older homes.<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released new, stricter guidelinesfor assessing lead poisoning in children.<\/p>\n<p>\nThe guidelines lower the amount of lead in the blood that's considered \"acceptable,\" from 10 micrograms of per deciliter to less than 5 micrograms.<br><br>\nThat's the first revision the CDC has issued in more than 20 years regarding lead in the blood, and long overdue, according to experts. As a result, the number of at-risk children jumps from about 77,000 to more than 440,000 nationwide.<br><br>\nThat's a big increase, and a wake-up call for parents. Because there's no cure for lead poisoning, you've got to prevent it from happening in the first place. The CDC emphasizes parental vigilance as the best preventative.<br><br>\nFor example, you should know that almost 90% of lead contamination comes from flaking and peeling paint on houses built before 1978 \u2014 the year that lead additives were banned from household paint. Anyone with a home built before 1978 should be alerted to the possibility of lead paint.<br><br>\nRenovations on older homes also contribute to contamination, as does contaminated well water. Even garden hoses have been found with lead.<br><br>\nTo determine if there's contaminated paint on your house, have the paint tested for lead. Hire a professional to safely remove lead paint.<br><br>\nOther simple prevention steps you can take:<\/p>\n<p>\n~ Keep surfaces clean. Lead paint dust from deteriorating houses can travel long distances, so being in a new neighborhood doesn't guarantee safety. Wet-mop floors and wipe windowsills. Leave shoes at your entry door to keep from tracking dust through the house.<\/p>\n<p>\n~ Keep kids' play areas and veggie gardens away from eave lines around houses and garages where roof runoff that contains lead dust may spill.<\/p>\n<p>\n~ Wash kids' hands frequently, especially before eating. Teach youngsters not to put anything in their mouths.<\/p>\n<p>\nThe CDC recommends that every child under the age of 2 be tested for lead. Exposure is particularly dangerous for children under 6 because their brains are developing. Elevated lead levels can cause learning disabilities, behavioral problems, seizures, and even death.<\/01:31 +0000\n a Tree Dies, Do You Feel It? <p>\nHave you ever lost a tree that was like a dear friend? Then prepare for heartbreak. We're going to lose many dear friends to the emerald ash borer.<\/p>\n<p>\nIf you've ever lost a favorite tree, you know that the emotional blow can rank right up there with any tough loss. Maybe not every tree in the yard tugs at our hearts. Some have that just-so shape and character -- the way they shelter the swing set or add a bit of majesty to the front of the house -- that makes them more than just big plants. <br><br>\nThey become members of the family.<br><br>\nI vividly remember waking up one Saturday morning in Des Moines after a particularly stormy night had passed. My wife had suddenly cried out from the kitchen, \"Oh no!\"<br><br>\nI sprang up to find the severe storm had felled our prize linden tree in the back yard. The winds had been so strong they'd snapped the two-foot-thick trunk, and the big tree lay in a sad, shaggy, disheveled heap. <br><br>\nJust like that, gone was our wonderful shade, our privacy, our greenery. Our friend. The back yard looked exposed and barren. <br><br>\nWith our two-year-old son in our arms, we all cried.<br><br>\nThe property was never quite the same. A year later, we sold the place, and moved on.<br><br>\nThose sad memories returned when I read the emerald ash borer had crossed over New York's Hudson River and was moving closer to New England. <br><br>\nThis destructive borer beetle has killed millions of ash trees in northern-tier states over the past decade, and no one quite knows how to stop it. And now many \u2014 if not all \u2014 ash trees in New England are doomed, too.<br><br>\nSome chemical treatments are being developed that require professional application at a cost of $40-$200 per tree. But the results are unsure -- and you'll have to treat your trees every year. <br><br>\nIf your trees are at risk, you're best bet is to seek help from your state extension service. They'll know what your options are. <br><br>\nFor those of you with these beautiful, deciduous hardwood trees, I hope a cure is coming. If not, I'll be feeling your pain.<br><br>\nThis danger to so many ash trees has us reminiscing about our favorite trees. Do you have any tree tales to share?<\/00:09 +0000\n Five: Housing Markets, Buyers Adjust to New Normal<p>\nHome sales rise, foreclosures fall, and the latest national flood insurance deadline looms.<\/p>\n<p>\nIn our Friday Five roundup of top housing news, we look at a return to traditional home sales: With rents on the rise across the country, many are taking advantage of low prices and short sale opportunities to trade in their lease for a mortgage.

Since curb appeal strongly influences home values, it's a great weekend to spruce up your own yard, especially if the neighbors are trying to sell their home.<\/p>\n<p>\nHow much value can neighborhood curb appeal add? Having nice landscaping adds $1,777 in home value when you're selling your home, according to data collected byHomeGain.com's annual survey about how home improvements boost home value.<\/p>\n<p>\nCurb appeal works in the other direction, too. If a for-sale house down the block is sporting some bad curb appeal, it could sell for less than it might otherwise. And that comparable sale drives down the value of your home.<\/p>\n<p>.<\/p>\n<p>\nHere are 6 quick exterior projects you can do in a day or two to add to your home's value and neighborhood appeal.<\/p>\n<p>\n~ Landscape for curb appeal by re-sodding bare spots, trimming shrubs, and adding colorful spring flowers to your front yard.<\/p>\n<p>\n~ Add some outdoor lighting for curb appeal to highlight your beautified yard after dark.<\/p>\n<p>\n~ Pitch in with the neighbors to rent a power washer for a day to give your sidewalks anddeck a little care and maintenance. Be gentle and careful if you decide to use the power washer to clean your home's exterior; you can easily blast things off your house, like the paint, or get water into siding seams.<\/p>\n<p>\n~ Clean your siding, whether it's brick, wood, or vinyl, by using a long-handled, soft-bristled brush, soap (trisodium phosphate), and water.<\/p>\n<p>\n~ Create a little cool curb appeal with house numbers \u2014 that is, dress up your address.<\/p>\n<p>\n~ Freshen up the look of winter-ravished patio furniture with new pillows, a bright umbrella, or a colorful tablecloth to give the impression to anyone at the open house that the neighbors have fun parties.<\/p>\n<p>\nAre your neighbors' yards boosting or detracting from home values on your block?<\/p>\n<p>\nBy: <a href=\" DeZube<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\n<\/56:46 +0000\n Ways to Invest in Real Estate<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Investing in real estate can seem overwhelming and reserved for the very rich. In the current economic conditions and marketplace, it may even feel a bit too risky. But if you've ever thought real estate investing may be right for you, this is a great time to learn about your options and how it can be done by almost anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<div>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Before we learn about our options, though, let me say that I believe real estate investing can be a long a cumbersome process if you are new to it. That is not a bad thing, and I think of a lengthy process as a series of checkpoints that will make me very sure of my decision at the end. But it does mean that you have to have a critical eye, some good research skills and an a greater-than-average supply of patience. If this sounds like you, then let's review how you can get into the lucrative business of real estate investing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Whatever your budget, real estate can be your investment vehicle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>1. All cash deal. <\/strong> If you have lots of cash, you may be able to find an investment property in your area and buy it without a mortgage. The advantage of this is that you will be a highly qualified buyer and you can probably secure a property for a bit of savings over a buyer who has to get a mortgage. Another advantage of a cash buyer is that her expenses are much lower, as there is no monthly mortgage payment. This enables her to be more flexible on the rent, giving her more options in choosing tenants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The disadvantage of an all cash deal is that it is not taking advantage of very low mortgage rates. Borrowing is pretty cheap, and if all your cash is in one place, you can't use it elsewhere. Leverage is a real estate investor's friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>2. Part cash, part mortgage.<\/strong> The down payment minimum is 20-30%, depending on various circumstances and your financial qualifications. My rule of thumb is that you should make money, or at least break even, with this kind of down payment. If you lose money on a monthly basis, the property is not worth the price, (at least not not for an investor). Your mortgage payments, any association fees and taxes should be covered by the rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The advantage here is that you'll be taking advantage of the cheap borrowing costs, and you'll own a property with an income without the whole cash outlay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The disadvantage is, obviously, the cost of borrowing money and the higher cost due to your mortgage payment \u2013 same as the mortgage on your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>3. Pool of investors with little cash.<\/strong> Gather a few friends and family, and pool your money together to buy one property. It can even be a small property at first, but at least get into the market. If ten friends get together with $15,000 each\u2026you do the math. The advantage is that you are in the real estate market, getting a piece of the pie, however small. It is a start, or a great single investment you have. You can hire a real estate broker and an attorney to help maybe for a stake in the property instead of commission and fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The disadvantage is finding like-minded individuals and putting it all together in a legally binding agreement. To me, this is just a bit of leg-work, and not so much a disadvantage, but it does add to the complexity of the transaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Entering the real estate market as an investor is not simple at first, but once you are in, it gets easier and easier. If you've ever considered investing in real estate, this is a great time to get in. Just choose your strategy and do it!<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><img alt=\"Ruth Lerner, Real Estate, Dwell360\" src=\" style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pxcolorcolorspan><\/p>Sat, 21 Jan 2012 04:06:15 +0000\n Landlords Save the World <p>\nThe title of this entry is over-the-top, I admit, but I am just here to stick up for the landlords out there who are trying to do some good. The word \"landlord\" in itself has some negativity associated with it, and the use of \"lord\" in this context is distasteful in our American sensibility. In media, landlords are portrayed as misers ready to make a buck on the poor and take advantage of families.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p>\nPlease!<\/p>\n<p>\nLet me tell you about the landlords, the real estate investors, I know.<\/p>\n<p>\nFirst and foremost, there is a commitment to maintain the property and keeping the tenant happy and comfortable, even with the high occupancy rate and the increasing rents. I am not suggesting any altruism here, but it is cheaper to keep than replace tenants. It only makes sense that tenants stay for a long-run, and take care of the property, as it is their home. Fostering that environment is essential for positive tenant-landlord relations, which is the relationship you want in between any consumer and supplier.<\/p>\n<p>\nA rental property is a huge financial commitment and a landlord idiot enough to not take care of it and ensure it's livability is ill suited for the job.<\/p>\n<p>\nYes, there are many terrible landlords out there.

Phew\u2026that's a relief.<\/span>\n<\/h1>\n<div>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">With the real estate market in the dumps for several years now, it is not easy to get back into the pro-property mind-set. But, it is exactly at these times that you should be considering expanding your real estate portfolio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">One reason I know this is because while the real estate market is dragging in most of the country, it is dominated by the professional real estate investors. Don't you want to learn a lesson or two from them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The professional investor loves real estate above all other investments. There are three main reasons for this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">First, real estate investing can come in many forms, just like any other investments. There are small condos, multi-family buildings, commercial, residential, mixed use properties, different towns, neighborhoods, etc. For every budget, preference and style, there is an investment instrument.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Second, real estate has a certain tangible value that you just don't see in other investments. Property investors love that there is an asset they can visit, fix and maintain. There is a satisfaction in knowing that you have some control and responsibility in the relative value of the property.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Third, although real estate is illiquid \u2013 meaning it takes relatively a lot of time and effort to sell it \u2013 it is a versatile investment. You can hold it, or resell it when the market turns your way. You can do extensive renovations and have a quick resell, or you can hold it with tenants for years to come. Whatever it is, you have options and you can make decisions based on the best scenarios for your needs and the market conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">All of this assumes that you have sufficient funds for a down payment and that your expenses on the property are covered. The major drawback in investment real estate are the unavoidable expenses in maintaining it and the difficulty of selling it if you need the cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">But this said, it may be time to consider an investment property, especially in such a critical time in the market. Opportunities and possibilities are present, and real estate investing can be a perfect fit for long-term financial goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"Ruth Lerner, Real Estate, Dwell360\" src=\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(74, 74, 74); font-family: Arial, sans-seriffont-size: 14px; colorfont-size: 14px; colorp>Sat, 21 Jan 2012 04:10:32 +0000\n Hasn't Your Home Sold?<p>\nIn the market of exasperated and exhausted home sellers, I hear a lot of great stories about why homes are not selling. They usually divide into two categories: the real estate agents not doing their jobs or the sellers are uncooperative.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p>\nEither type of story leads to the same place: how are you marketing and showing the home?<\/p>\n<p>\nThere are very few reasons why your home doesn't sell. There is no mystery here. There are bad agents and uncooperative sellers, and both can change when they realize that this is not brain surgery. There are only two variables: the price and how well the house shows.<img alt=\"Sold Real Estate 1px; margin-bottom: 1px; float: right; width: 150px; height: 113px; \"><\/p>\n<p>\nFirst of all, and at the top of the list, be realistic about the price. This is a common sticking point between agents and sellers and almost always the reason for trouble. If you insist on getting more than what the market is willing to give, you are not serious about selling, but wasting time.<\/p>\n<p>\nYou must take into consideration the issues with the location, condition and layout of the home. Don't ignore it and don't dance around it. Buyers know what they are looking at.<\/p>\n<p>\nAlso, home sellers sometimes hire the agent who gave the highest price in the presentation, as if this is a bidding war. This creates a situation where agents are often uncomfortable saying what they really think the house will sell for, and inflating the price knowing they will later ask for a price reduction.<\/p>\n<p>\nStupid. Don't do that. Whoever brings you the highest price should be questioned about why this price is the best and how they intend to get it.<\/p>\n<p>\nNext comes the reality about how well the home shows. Inexperienced agents are often shy (as I was in my early days), about telling homeowners their homes look awful. There are better ways to say it, but a good agent gives you a long to-do list or insists on a staging professional.<\/p>\n<p>\nIf you are serious about selling your home, it should be professionally cleaned, sparkling and smelling perfectly for every single showing. Clutter and personal belongings, (anything but furniture and a few chachkies), will get in the way of the showing.<\/p>\n<p>\nWhen buyers come in, they need to see themselves in this home and be excited about it. When you leave your computer on, your mail all over the place, your clothes on door hangers, your wet towel, toothbrush and one dirty dish, buyers feel like they are invading. It's like walking into a hotel room to find someone else's stuff. Ech.<\/p>\n<p>\nA bad agent doesn't tell you the truth about the house, but instead sugar coats it to the point of misunderstanding. It is not our job to fall in love with your home! It is our job as real estate agents to tell you what you have to do to get the house sold.<\/p>\n<p>\nHome sellers will mistake good advice for rudeness and agents make a mistake of being shy of saying what needs to be said. Instead of making tough decisions, everyone blames the economy and the weather for a home sitting on the market forever.<\/p>\n<p>\nIf any other home in your area has sold, especially if it was in your price range, their is a market for your home. Just don't tell me a story about why the economy has not sold the house.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p\n<p>\n<\/p>Thu, 27 Oct 2011 17:06:00 +0000\n You Prepared for the Next Time the Earth Shakes?<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Like everyone else, we were stunned by the 5.9 magnitude <a href=\" centered in Mineral, Va., today at around 2 p.m., and felt throughout the East Coast.<\/span\">Several HouseLogic bloggers live in the Washington, D.C., area, about 100 miles away from the quake's epicenter: I'm in McLean, Va., and felt my car shaking in my driveway; Dona DeZube in Clarksville, Md., thought a gas line exploded when she felt the earth tremble; and Lara Edge, who lives in D.C., watched her neighbors run out of their homes (never leave your home!) but didn't feel much on the street.<br><br>\nRather than running into the street, the best plan is to be prepared, like by putting together an <a href=\" kit<\/a>.

As President Kennedy famously said many years ago, \"Ask what you can do for your country.\"<\/p>\n<p>\nWe'd all like to do our part. But our individual efforts sure seem small compared with the goings-on of world politics and global economies.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\nHow can we \u2014 average American home owners \u2014 really achieve big goals, such as influencing national energy policy and building a strong economy? After all, we've got our own daily stuff to deal with: work, <a href=\" repairs<\/a>, getting the kids to softball practice, and the dog to the vet.<br><br>\nOne good way is to reduce energy consumption in our own homes. This simple act can have a major impact. Not just in terms of helping hold the line on the <a href=\" budget<\/a>, but in slowing the ever-spiraling costs of energy. Lessening demand \u2014 even incrementally \u2014 eases the price of energy, which can free up capital that creates jobs and helps get our economy kicking.<br><br>\nHere are examples of small contributions you can make that add up:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nAsk cable or satellite providers for an energy-efficient set-top box, (the device that receives and dispatches TV signals to your DVR). Set-top boxes, which run 24 hours a day, have become a leading energy drain in the home. Newer <a href=\" Star-rated models<\/a> are at least 30% more efficient. If all set-top boxes sold in the U.S. were Energy Star-rated, energy savings would total $2 billion each year, and greenhouse gases would be reduced by an amount equivalent to 3 million cars and trucks.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nReplacing an old, kaput dishwasher with an <a href=\" Star<\/a>-qualified model cuts the annual energy cost of the machine by 50% \u2014 to $60 from $120. If every <a href=\" washer<\/a>purchased in the U.S. this year were an efficient Energy Star model, the national energy savings would total $350 million, not to mention conserving 32 billion gallons of water.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nBuying a high-efficiency gas or electric water heater, when yours reaches the end of its useful life, saves 3% to 4% on the average home's hot water bill. Energy standards enacted by the U.S. Dept. of Energy in 2010 were designed to cut energy usage of new water heaters by 3% to 4%. Over a 30-year period, U.S. consumers should save <a href=\" billion<\/a> and reduce CO2 emissions by 170 million tons \u2014 that's equal to the yearly emissions of 30 million cars.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nReplacing a 60-watt incandescent light bulb with a 13-watt compact fluorescent equivalent saves $30 over the life of the bulb. Alternative: LED bulbs, although costly ($30 for 7-watts), last 3 to 4 times longer than CFLs, burn cooler, and \u2014 unlike CFLs \u2014 contain no mercury. If every home in America replaced just one <a href=\" bulb<\/a> with an Energy Star-qualified CFL, the savings would be enough to light more than 3 million homes. The savings would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil-fuel energy production equivalent to 800,000 autos.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\nMore easy ways to be patriotic (and save):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nCreate a breeze with a <a href=\" fan<\/a> instead of using the AC. For every degree you raise the air conditioning thermostat above 78 degrees, you can save 3% to 8% on cooling costs.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nInstall a <a href=\" thermostat<\/a> and save as much as $180 per year.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nPlump up <a href=\" insulation<\/a> from R-11 to R-49 and save up to $600 per year.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nTurn down the thermostat on your <a href=\" and save $22 per year.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul>\n<li>\nOutsmart sneaky <a href=\" vampires<\/a> by turning off (or putting \"to sleep\") computers, printers, and other electronics when not in use: Shave another $100 from your annual energy bill.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\nLet's put the independence in Independence Day.<br><br>\nIn what ways do you save energy in your household?<\/p>\n<p>\nBy: <a href=\" Riha<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPublished: July 1, 2011<\/p>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 21:04:10 +0000\n Father's Day, Actions Speak Louder Than Ties <p>\nFather's Day is Sunday.

Find out when and how to use them. By: <a href=\" M. Filisko<\/a>\n<\/div>\n<div>\nWhen you're selling your home, the idea of adding a sweetener to the transaction\u2014whether it's a decorating allowance, a home warranty, or a big-screen TV\u2014can be a smart use of marketing funds. To ensure it's not a big waste, follow these dos and don'ts:<\/div>\n<div>\nDo use homebuyer incentives to set your home apart from close competition. If all the sale properties in your neighborhood have the same patio, furnishing yours with a luxury patio set and stainless steel BBQ that stay with the buyers will make your home stand out.<br><br>\nDo compensate for flaws with a homebuyer incentive. If your kitchen sports outdated floral wallpaper, a $3,000 decorating allowance may help buyers cope. If your furnace is aging, a home warranty may remove the buyers' concern that they'll have to pay thousands of dollars to replace it right after the closing.<br><br>\nDon't assume homebuyer incentives are legal. Your state may ban homebuyer incentives, or its laws may be maddeningly confusing about when the practice is legal and not. Check with your real estate agent and attorney before you offer a homebuyer incentive.<br><br>\nDon't think buyers won't see the motivation behind a homebuyer incentive.Offering a homebuyer incentive may make you seem desperate. That may lead suspicious buyers to wonder what hidden flaws exist in your home that would force you to throw a freebie at them to get it sold. It could also lead buyers to factor in your apparent anxiety and make a lowball offer.<br><br>\nDon't use a homebuyer incentive to mask a too-high price. A buyer may think your expensive homebuyer incentive\u2014like a high-end TV or a luxury car\u2014is a gimmick to avoid lowering your sale price. Many top real estate agents will tell you to list your home at a more competitive price instead of offering a homebuyer incentive. A property that's priced a hair below its true value will attract not only buyers but also buyers' agents, who'll be giddy to show their clients a home that's a good value and will sell quickly.<br><br>\nIf you're convinced a homebuyer incentive will do the trick, choose one that adds value or neutralizes a flaw in your home. Addressing buyers' concerns about your home will always be more effective than offering buyers an expensive toy.<\/div>\n<div>\nMore from HouseLogic<\/div>\n<div>\n<a href=\" the right home price<\/a> <br><br><a href=\" an appraisal to set your home price<\/a> <br><br><a href=\" the right offer on your home<\/a>\n<\/div>\n<div>\nOther web resources<\/div>\n<div>\n<a href=\" on homebuyer incentives<\/a>\n<\/div>\n<div>\nG.M.

It is true. The average sale price is up 3.63% in the Garden City. A client needed some real estate sales data and some of the figures we compare was 2009 and 2010 sales data in MLS for closings for each year for the time range of January 1 \u2013 November 15.<br><br>For the time frame noted above, the average sale price in 2009 was $845,434 and in 2010 is $876,186 for single family homes. We also noted a slight increase in the actual number of single family homes sold just 428 in 2009 and 449 homes sold in 2010. One notworthy piece of data is the days a home is on the market before going under agreement went down by 6 days from 77 in 2009 to 71 in 2010.<br><br>It is always interesting to see how many of these sales exceed $2,000,000. In 2009 it was 11 homes and in 2010 there was 18 homes that sold for $2,000,000 or more. This is a notable statistic as higher priced homes can influence the average sale price in the given market.<br><br>In 2010 the single family homes on the market in Newton MA sold for 97% of the most recent asking price set for the property.

It is a topic that is often overlooked by buyers during the process of their home search. But, the cost for insurance, average of $900, is with you for the life of ownership and you take time to consider the implications. If you already own your home and it is vacant or unoccupied you should take a second look at your policy.<br><br>Just a few years ago I received a quote for insurance that was leaps and bounds higher then my current policy in place. It turned out that the Boston zip codes had been confused and all was quickly remedied in my favor. That was a taste of how sensitive real estate insurance rates can be for homeowners.<br><br>An independent insurance agent can often help you though the process of getting a quote for a prospective home you might be purchasing. In Massachusetts and the rest of New England when it comes to your home there is a long list of \"what-ifs\" and everything from natural disasters, mistakes, and human involvement play a key role. <br><br>MSN Real Estate's recent article, \"<a href=\" things that can lower or raise your homeowners insurance rates<\/a>\" is a great list of items to consider when looking to buy a home. Review the list below and review the article for more details of each item.<br><br><a href=\" Is the area susceptible to hurricanes, mudslides, wildfires or other natural disasters?<br>2. How's the roof? New? Wind- and hail-resistant?<br>3. Is the plumbing new?<br>4. Does the electrical system meet current code?<br>5. How far away is the fire department?<br>6.

Is a swimming pool on the property?<\/a><br><br>If your home is vacant or unoccupied there are other considerations you must make. Often insurance agencies will void a policy after your home has been vacant after 30days. The REALTORS here at Dwell360 have seen many homes in both the city and suburbs of Boston. It would not be a shock to see missing copper pipes, vandalized property, leaking roofs, missing appliances, and personal items taken. In many cases issues that are sudden surprises to the seller. <br><br>When your home is vacant you need to make arrangements with your insurance provided. \"The Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association (MPIUA) also known as the Massachusetts FAIR Plan (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) provides basic property insurance on eligible property for applicants who have been unable to gain insurance through the voluntary market.\" The cost might be higher with a policy willing to let your own be vacant but the risk of a home not being properly insured is much greater.

No, It could be off by 20%.<p>Property valuation websites have a lot of information to offer. They provide details on properties, sale history, tax information, and estimate the value of the home. As a result, they become a topic of conversation with our clients on a regular basis. The only issue is we often find ourselves explaining to clients why the site is not always accurate.<br><br>Today, at a Boston real estate conference, Agent Reboot, Zillow representatives talked about their service and how they are among the only who <a href=\" about their valuations accuracy<\/a>. Zillow's \"Zestimate\" that provides value estimates of single family homes, condominiums, and multi-families are often wrong. In fact Zillow has actually published their Zestimates accuracy for the Boston metro real estate market. Their median error is 8.9%. <\/p><p>This means if a Zestimate labeled your home with a $500,000 price tag it could really sell for $44,500 more or less than that price. In fact only 30% of the Zestimates are within 5% of the sale price. They actually review that 80% of the Zestimate are within 20% of the sale price. This is a big range. This is similar to say your home is worth $500,000 and will sell between $400,000 to $600,000. An article published by <a href=\" also clearly outlines Zillow's accurancy.<br><br>We do like Zillow.

Reporters crunched reams of data to find the optimal combo of job opportunities, fiscal strength, top-notch schools, low crime, good health care, lots to do, and many other factors that help a town great for raising a family.\" They also took a look at the overall strength of the economy and housing market in various American metro areas. <br><br>It becomes clear the real estate and economic climate in Massachusetts is a bit more promising then some other areas in the country. Money's research pointed out that the metro area of Peabody and Boston have a \"strong\" economy and housing market with metro Cambridge getting the best rating of being the \"strongest.\" We think this is pretty consistent with what we have seen in the past year within the housing market itself.<br><br>The <a href=\" of Newton<\/a> Massachusetts with a population 82,000, 13 villages, and a rich New England heritage ranked <a href=\" on the list of top 100<\/a> cities in Money magazine. The magazine highlighted the cities great schools, low crime, and strong economy as reasons for the favorable standing. It also noted pricey homes and traffic as negatives just west of Boston. We are also happy to see that it got noticed for having an \"A\" grade for \"Arts\/leisure\" and for the \"health\" category. Schools are important in Newton, <a href=\" ranked<\/a>, and just this week the new, 413,000 square foot, <a href=\" million dollar<\/a>, Newton North High School opened its doors and features a college like amenities that is simply state-of-the-art. <br><br>With a population of 60,000 the <a href=\" of Waltham<\/a> Massachusetts was <a href=\" 28th<\/a> on the Money list. It scored an \"A\" grade for the Arts\/leisure along with health. Housing affordability, though lower then Newton, is still high compared to other cities on the top 100 list. This city has seen recent renovations to <a href=\" schools<\/a>. Moody street is filled with restaurants and nightlife, home to Brandeis and Bentley University, and economically strong do to the large of corporations that call Waltham home. <br><br><a href=\" Massachusetts<\/a> with a 58,000 population is listed <a href=\" on the list<\/a> top America's 100 Best Small Cities list. It might not get the best markets for housing affordability but this town gets the grade for everything else. Exclusive condos typically exceed a price tag of $500,000 and single family homes often considered estates reach well past the multiple million dollar value. Brookline's exciting location next to Boston, active neighborhoods, public transportation, high-owner occupancy, and great schools make this town both stable and exclusive. <br><br>The fourth Massachusetts city on Money's list is <a href=\" Massachusetts<\/a> and <a href=\" at 52.<\/a> Located on the south shore this area has more affordable homes and features 12 miles of ocean front. It is has reasonable commute to Boston. The location also provides its residences to beach, access to Cape Cod, and other exciting cultural and leisure actives in the area. <br><br>There are many fine cities and towns in Massachusetts. These are four that have been listed by Money magazine this year. We think they are great communities that deserve to be highlighted.<br><br><a href=\" is a residential real estate brokerage in Massachusetts founded by Edward Johnston and John Lynch.

We have put listings under agreement and buyers have secured properties.

A few days ago I took clients from the west coast out to see 32 properties in three days. Then we have local buyers that have put in offers on properties and each time is dealing with multiple bid situations. Then there are a few other buyers are just sitting waiting for something to visit.<br><br>In the markets we deal in (there are a few like, Newton, Brookline, Boston, Wellesley, Wayland, Waltham, Cambridge, &amp; other great Massachusetts towns) there are plenty of people interested in purchasing a property, but the inventory is not great. The homes that are in great condition with a price that presents a certain amount of value to the buyer are scooped up and at times in multiple bids situations.<br><br><b>What does that mean?<\/b><br><br>The buyers visit a lot of home. They are learning about the market everyday and have been doing their homework. After visiting dozens and dozens of homes they understand their price range better than some real estate agents. Then when they walk into a well priced, great condition home, that has a great price it is gone. <br><br>The buyer knows when there is something well priced. Now, I mean well priced, not free, not being given away, a price that presents a fair value. Buyers are ready and want to purchase a home. They just are willing to wait for the place that works best for their life and their pocket book.<br><br>So for the people with those perfect homes that want to move you will stand out if you look great and are priced well. <\/p>Sun, 18 Apr 2010 01:29:32 +0000\n 26 too many?<div><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; \">Friday there was 11, Saturday was 9, and Sunday finished with 6.

{"text":"Hazy days of summer can boost air pollution, health risks for many\n\nIn Washington, we welcome warm sunny weather, ready to spend more time outdoors in the garden and on hiking trails. Summer said State Health Officer Dr. Maxine Hayes. \" New research suggests that breathing air that has high \"particulate\" matter, or fine particles, can also be risky for people who are obese or have diabetes. Children are vulnerable to polluted air because their lungs are still growing and they spend more time outdoors.\n\nDifferent things cause summer air pollution. Several consecutive days of sunny, hot weather will increase ozone. Wildfires like the ones that have broken out in central Washington recently produce smoky air that contains fine particles and toxic chemicals. Cars and trucks generate exhaust. On calm days when the air is still, air pollutants build up. Ongoing climate changes are projected to cause additional bad air quality by increasing wildfires and ozone pollution.\n\nEveryone can lower their exposure to air pollution by checking air quality conditions before taking part in outdoor activities, especially people in high risk groups. When air pollution is high, people should limit outdoor activity and choose less strenuous things to do \u2014 such as going for a walk instead of a run. Pollution levels are often highest at midday or in the afternoon, so exercising earlier or later may be wise. Indoor exercise is another option.\n\nWhere vehicle exhaust may be higher, it helps to spend less time in traffic and to avoid exercising near traffic. There are several air quality resources available, including websites and a smartphone app.\n\nClickable state maps with information about current air quality can be found at the state Department of Ecologywebsite. Airwatch NW has information about air quality, burn bans, and tips on clean home heating. The American Lung Association offers State of the Air, a free smartphone app for iPhone and Android with current air quality information.

However, air duct cleaning has been shown at times to help ease some issues that can contribute to allergies, asthma, and respiratory conditions.\n\nAllan Dexter, the owner of Air Quality Control Environmental in Coral Springs, Florida, says, \"Air ducts need to be cleaned when people in homes become routinely sick or have respiratory reactions. People with allergies, asthma, and immune system problems can benefit from the cleaning of air ducts. Moreover, people should consider air duct cleaning when they see the presents of dirt on ceiling grills, after a house fire or flood, when dusting is required more frequently, and after home construction work has been completed.\"\n\nThere are many health issues that can be alleviated by cleaning the air ducts in homes. The removal of various pollutants can improve the air quality in homes, which can help improve many health related issues.\n\nMore Like This\n\nWhen you begin to suffer allergy attacks year-round, your air ducts may be contaminated with springtime pollens.

The Dangerous Days of Summer report recognizes the serious impact poor air quality has on the health of children, but especially on those with asthma, and lays out a plan to reduce by 80% the most important sources of air pollution that trigger asthma.\n\n\"This report is a wake up call. Fighting for clean air in this country means fighting for the millions of kids that struggle to breathe every day because of pollution,\" said John Balbus, M.D., M.P.H., director of the health program at Environmental Defense. \"The good news is that the country can curb the triggers of asthma and ease the burden of other health consequences from air pollution. An urgent first step toward this goal is for EPA to cut the harmful pollution from power plant smokestacks instead of weakening long-standing clean air protections.\"\n\nEDITORIAL\nAs medical technology advances, new information about health risks disease becomes common knowledge. Among members of the general public, discussions about disease risk factors and potential links to lifestyles and genetics are common topics.\n\nOne item of particular concern is the ongoing debate about potential relationships between cancer risk and substances that people normally come into contact with at home or in the workplace.\n\nSome studies suggest that exposure to chemicals that \"mimic\" hormones -- including drugs taken in some hormone replacement therapies -- might increase breast or ovarian cancer risk.\n\nSept. 13, 2004 \u2014 The air in some parts of Southern California is so dirty that it impedes the development of children's lungs.\n\nBy the time they are 18, many children who grow up in polluted areas have lungs that are underdeveloped and will likely stay that way into adulthood, claims a study in the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine."}
{"text":"EPA tightens standards for soot pollution\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - InEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson said the new standard will save thousands of lives each year and reduce the burden of illness in communities across the country, as people \"benefit from the simple fact of being able to breathe cleaner air.\"\n\nAs a mother of two sons who have battled asthma, Jackson said she was pleased that \"more mothers like me will be able to rest a little easier knowing their children, and their children's children, will have cleaner air to breathe for decades to come.\"\n\nAnnouncement of the new standard met a court deadline in a lawsuit by 11 states and public health groups. The new annual standard is 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air, down from the current 15 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nThe new soot standard has been highly anticipated by environmental and business groups, who have battled over the extent to which it would protect public health or cause job losses. The EPA said its analysis shows the rule will have a net benefit ranging from about $3.6 billion to $9 billion a year.\n\nA study by the American Lung Association and other groups said the new standard will save an estimated 15,000 lives a year - many in urban areas where exposure to emissions from older, dirty diesel engines and coal-fired power plants are greatest.\n\nSoot, or fine particulate matter, is made up of microscopic particles released from smokestacks, diesel trucks, wood-burning stoves and other sources and contributes to haze. Breathing in soot can cause lung and heart problems, contributing to heart attacks, strokes and asthma attacks.\n\nEnvironmental groups and public health advocates welcomed the new standard, saying it will protect millions of Americans at risk for soot-related asthma attacks, lung cancer, heart disease and premature death.\n\nDr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association, said a new standard will force industries to clean up what he called a \"lethal pollutant.\" Reducing soot pollution \"will prevent heart attacks and asthma attacks and will keep children out of the emergency room and hospitals,\" Edelman said in a statement. \"It will save lives.\"\n\nBut congressional Republicans and industry officials called the new standard overly strict and said it could hurt economic growth and cause job losses in areas where pollution levels are determined to be too high. Conservative critics said they feared the rule was the beginning of a \"regulatory cliff\" that includes a forthcoming EPA rule on ozone, or smog, as well as pending greenhouse gas regulations for refineries and rules curbing mercury emissions at power plants.\n\nRoss Eisenberg, vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the new soot rule is \"yet another costly, overly burdensome\" regulation that is \"out of sync\" with President Barack Obama's executive order last year to streamline federal regulations.\n\nThe soot rule will \"place many promising new projects - and the jobs they create - into permit limbo,\" Eisenberg said.\n\nA letter signed by one Democratic and five Republican senators said the EPA rule would \"impose significant new economic burdens on many communities, hurting workers and their families just as they are struggling to overcome difficult economic times.\"\n\nThe letter cited EPA data showing that air quality in the United States is at its highest level in 30 years - a sign that the current standard is working, the senators said. The letter was signed by Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch and Michael Lee of Utah, Roy Blunt of Missouri, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Rob Portman of Ohio and Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.\n\nA letter signed by 56 House Democrats said the new standards will mean fewer hospital trips for millions of people and billions of dollars saved.\n\n\"Morally and fiscally, this is a no-brainer,\" said the letter, initiated by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. He and other supporters said the new standards were particularly important in urban areas such as New York and Los Angeles, where soot and smog and can make breathing difficult.\n\nThe letter cited a report issued last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that racial minorities are more likely to live in areas where air pollution exceeds national standards.\n\nJackson and other administration officials said the new rule was based on a rigorous scientific review. Only 66 of more than 3,000 U.S. counties would fail to meet the proposed standard, which takes effect early next year.\n\nThe EPA said it would start designating counties that fail to meet the new soot standards as soon as December 2014, but would give states up to five years to meet the revised standard.\n\nAll but seven counties in the United States - all in California - are projected to meet the new standard by 2020 with no additional actions needed beyond compliance with existing and pending rules set by the EPA, EPA officials said. The counties are Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino and Tulare.\n\nJackson and other officials said they will work with states and counties to ensure they can meet the new standards without penalties, including loss of federal transportation money.\n\nThe Obama administration had sought to delay the new soot standards until after the November election, but a federal judge ordered officials to act sooner, and the administration released a proposed rule in June"}

{"text":"FAQ\n\nWhat is Ozone?\n\nOzone is often referred to as nature's own purifier. It is eviden at the seashore, in rain forests and after thunderstorms. We are all throughly aware of the protection the ozone layer affords us. Ozone also referred to as activated oxygen or trivalent oxygen is created naturally in our environment either through electricity, photosynthesis or by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It makes up approximately 20% of the air we breathe everyday. Ozone is created when one of these forces cause Oxygen to split into two separate atoms. The freed atom then attaches itself to a O2 molecule, recombining to create Ozone. The word \"Ozone\" is derived from the Greek word \"ozien\" which means, \"to smell\". In high levels ozone is bluish in color, which is why the sky is blue. Ozone was discovered in the late 1800's and is classified as the second strongest oxidizer in the world. In has been used over the last century to purify water and eliminate a wide range of odors in as a wide range of applications. In the most effective types of product the ozone is generated by high-voltage corona discharge duplicating the way lightning creates it.\n\nHow Does Ozone Work To Eliminate Odors?\n\nAs ozone is created it floats freely in the air and water. By nature it is an unstable molecule and has a half-life of approximately 20 minutes. Shortly after ozone is created it begins to break back down. It will cast off the first ozone atom, which will recombine with either another oxygen atom, reverting back to simple Oxygen (O2), or it will recombine with another gaseous element forming an inert gas losing all of its odor characteristics. Picture a room full of smoke; it is the phenol gas that is released that is the basis of the odor. It is in the air and on the surface of all areas exposed to the smoke. When introduced to that environment, the ozone quickly breaks down as it combines with the phenol gas molecule destroying all odor characteristics.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Using Ozone?\n\nOzone is very effective in eliminating ordors including tobacco smoke, human and pet odors, food odors, mold and mildew odors, garbage odors, renovation odors and much more. It is not a re-odorant. It totally destroys the offending gases that are the source of everything we smell. Unlike many other deodorizing methods, ozone actually searches out and destorys the problem gases. It will react with contaminants in the air, water, fabrics and on other surface of the walls and ceilings. Unlike other types of air purification systems, an ozone generator does not depend on the air passing through the machine to do its job. Ozone generators also produce large quanities of ions via the corona discharge. The ions cause the dust particles to agglomerate, and precipitate from the air leaving a cleaner environment.\n\nWhat are ions?\n\nIons are charged particles in the air that are formed in nature when enough energy acts upon a molecule such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, water or nitrogen to eject an electron from the molecule leaving a positively charged Ion. The displaced electron attaches itself to a nearby molecule, which then becomes a negatively charged Ion. It is the negative ion of oxygen that affects us the most. Remember that feeling you've experienced near a waterfall or high in the mountains? Those are two places that thousand of negative ions occur. They create an effect on human biochemistry. The normal Ion count in fresh country air is 2,000 to 4,000 negative Ions per cubic centimeter (about the size of a sugar cube). At Yosemite Falls, you'll experience over 100,000 negative Ions per cubic centimeter, on the other hand, the level is far below 100 per cubic centimeter on the Los Angeles freeways during rush hour.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using negative Ions?\n\nThe negative ions cause microscopic particles (particulates) floating in a room, that often cause people to have allergic reactions, to clump together and fall to the floor where they can be vacuumed up. This is due to an electrostatic charge between the negative ions and other air molecules and particles in the air. Negative ionizers have been used for years to help rid closed indoor environments of allergens such as dust particles, animal dander, polen, mold spores, cigarette smoke, cigar smoke, particulate matter, etc. floating in the air. According to the book, The Ion Effect, negative ions are effective for allergies, asthma, cararrh, hay fever, sinusitis, eczema, burns, emphysema, and even as a substitute for transquilizers. It was discovered that negative ions balance serotonin in the body, and this explains why people tend to feel more alert, stable and energized in the presence of negative ions."}
{"text":"Traffic is a major source of air pollutants, and more studies are looking at the role of traffic-related air pollution in children's health. Researchers report in this issue that young children exposed to higher levels of traffic pollution have a greater incidence of otitis media (middle ear infections) than those exposed to lower levels [EHP 114:1414\u20131418; Brauer et al.]. In 2002, the same team found that such pollution increased the risk for asthma and upper respiratory tract infections in young children. Now they focus on otitis media because upper respiratory tract infections often progress to ear infections, which are one of the leading reasons for visits to doctors and the use of antibiotics in childhood.\n\nThe new study involved approximately 3,700 Dutch children and 650 German children surveyed from birth to age 2 years. Researchers in those countries monitored the concentrations of three common traffic-related pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter less than 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter, and elemental carbon) at 40 different sites in each country, then used those data to estimate exposures at each child's residence. The levels of pollutants measured were similar in both countries and fell within a range commonly experienced by people living in industrialized nations. Information about doctor-diagnosed otitis media came from questionnaires answered by parents.\n\nBoth groups of children showed an increase in otitis media in association with greater traffic pollution exposure. By age 2, a third of the children had experienced otitis media at least once. The adjusted odds ratios of contracting otitis media associated with modest increases in exposure to the different air pollutants ranged from 1.09 to 1.24, and the risk of ear infections was similar for each of the three pollutants measured. Although environmental tobacco smoke has been linked to otitis media in studies by other researchers, exposure to this agent did not alter the associations between traffic pollution and otitis media observed in this study.\n\nOtitis media has been estimated to cost the U.S. health care system $3\u20135 billion yearly. These findings, the first to link traffic pollution to otitis media, represent an additional consequence of air pollution. Protecting children from exposure to vehicular emissions\u2014for example, by building major roadways away from residential zones, improving automobile emission standards, and driving less\u2014may reduce the risk of otitis media."}

Observation of daytime chlorine is surprising because chlorine molecules break apart just minutes after entering the atmosphere and being exposed to sunlight.\n\nWith these measurements, scientists estimate that chlorine photochemistry creates five to eight parts per billion of the maximum daily ozone level, which in California typically ranges between 40 and 80 parts per billion.\n\n\"Chlorine chemistry can have a direct impact on surface ozone even at parts per trillion levels,\" said Eric Saltzman, professor of Earth system science in the School of Physical Sciences at UCI. \"Because of the strong link between ozone and human health, we need to fully understand the role chlorine may play in ozone chemistry in coastal urban environments.\"\n\nSaltzman and Brandon Finley, a graduate student researcher in the Department of Earth System Science, published their findings in the current issue of Geophysical Research Letters.\n\nCh with hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from automobile and power plant emissions, contributing to the complex chain of reactions that leads to ozone formation.

{"text":"Blog \u00bb regional planning\n\nEarlier this month, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) unanimously adopted new air quality guidelines related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and particulate matter (PM 2.5) from land use projects. The comprehensive new guidelines, among the most stringent in the nation, address the impacts of air pollutants, as well as recent changes in state and federal air quality. The guidelines also include air quality significance thresholds and mitigation measures local agencies can use when preparing air quality impact analyses under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\n\nSome significant changes to the guidelines include:\n\nSingle family housing projects of 56 dwelling units or greater, hotels with more than 83 hotel rooms and general office buildings with more than 53,000 square feet will all be considered to have a significant impact on GHG emissions under CEQA.\n\nLocal governments are encouraged to adopt qualified GHG Reduction Strategies.\n\nNew screening criteria and threshold levels have been set for extremely fine particulate matter emissions and toxic air contaminants. Projects which fall above these new thresholds will be required determine whether the project will result in a significant impact, including evaluation of emissions within a 1,000 foot radius of the proposed project.\n\nStricter greenhouse gas and particulate matter guidelines are a good thing, right? Not always, say some who argue that the new guidelines may inadvertently lead to more sprawl by making it harder to develop the denser parts of our region. Some worry that the new regulatory obstacles will drive up the costs of future affordable housing, infill, and transit-oriented development (TOD) projects. Developers and cities are concerned that the new guidelines will make compliance with SB 375, the State's law which requires compact development, more difficult.\n\nThe guidelines do contain a method for local governments to accelerate the CEQA review process for projects that are infill or transit-oriented. To do this, a city can prepare a GHG Reduction Strategy and have it approved by BAAQMD. Projects or plans consistent with these strategies could then be considered less than significant under CEQA, and therefore exempt from full review. With cities around the region reeling from the budget crisis, and in some cases cutting planning staff, however, resources to develop these strategies are in short supply.\n\nSan Francisco has already begun working on a GHG Reduction Strategy, so it is unlikely that the BAAQMD Guidelines will cause significant environmental review process changes for projects in the City; the new air quality standards will likely have more significant impacts on projects and plans in jurisdictions without GHG Reduction Strategies or detailed climate change related policies.\n\nWhat are the most pressing issues facing California in the next 15 years and how should we deal with them? If only there were one comprehensive PDF document floating around the internet with all the answers.\n\nPolicy wonks across the state will now be thrilled to discover the Public Policy Institute of California's recently released CA2025 report, a \"briefing kit\" covering California's most important long-term policy issues. Outlining policies on topics ranging from water to transportation to the economy, the report acts as a kind of handbook for every major policy concern confronting the state today. While one might expect an insufferably dense document, the text is actually quite accessible, the graphics clear and informative. Some might crave more detail and in-depth analysis than CA2025 provides, but the report still serves as an excellent primer for the key issues facing the state, and presents compelling arguments for how our policy makers might tackle them.\n\nThis past fall, a group of SPUR board members and staff traveled to Washington DC to learn from the urban-planning successes of our nation's capital; today, three members of that group presented their findings at a lunchtime forum.\n\nSPUR Deputy Director Sarah Karlinsky began the discussion with an overview of the Washington urban planning models from Pierre L'Enfant's plan of 1791 to and James McMillan's Plan of 1901 through modern-day endeavors to enliven the long-neglected Southeast waterfront area along the Anacostia. Regional Planning Director Egon Terplan expanded the geographical scope of the discussion, demonstrating with satellite photography areas in the region where forward-thinking transit-planning decisions brought about transit-oriented development along major corridors and high public transit use. Terplan focused on the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor in Virginia and Bethesda in Maryland, both tremendous successes in inducing dense development clustered around regional rail service.\n\nFinally, architect and urban historian Rod Freebairn-Smith showed photographs gathered during the trip focused on how security threats affect both civic life and architecture. His photos included many examples of how buildings have been fortified through bollardization and other means, while not marring the storied city or preventing access to national monuments and icons.\n\nStudy after study has shown that cities prioritize development that lets visitors and residents walk, bicycle, or take public transit to get around, people are healthier and have far less negative impact on the environment. Now, a new study by TransForm entitled Windfall for All demonstrates another benefit to developing livable communities: people who do not use cars to get around spend far less money on transportation than people who do. Citing AAA estimates, the report shows that, on average, it costs $8,097 per year to own, maintain, register, insure, and fuel a vehicle. In all, individuals in the Bay Area spend $34 billion on private transportation, most of which on owning and operating cars.\n\nEspecially in current tough economic conditions, finding ways to cut costs is critical, and that includes money spent on transportation. Yet many Bay Area towns and cities have prioritized development that not only encourages auto use, but precludes other ways to travel. As the study asserts, people can only move away from expensive auto use toward more affordable transportation means if cities give them the means to do so by putting housing near transit, ensuring pedestrians and bicyclists can get around safely, and investing in pleasant places that are nicer to be in than to drive past.\n\nHow can cities best position themselves in the green economy? What is the role of manufacturing in urban areas? How can a city best choose an economic development strategy given its size and unique economic history? How should federal policy support policy innovation among cities?\n\nJoin us for an evening discussion with nationally-recognized visiting writer and professor Joan Fitzgerald. She will give us a preview of her new book, Emerald Cities: Urban Sustainability and Economic Development, to be published by Oxford University Press in early 2010. In the book, Joan Fitzgerald shows how in the absence of a comprehensive national policy, cities have taken the lead in addressing the interrelated environmental problems of global warming, pollution, energy dependence, and social justice. Her analysis includes a comparison of 24 cities throughout the United States - major cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco (of course) but also less known places such as Toledo and Syracuse.\n\nJoan Fitzgerald is a nationally-recognized writer and professor who directs the Law, Policy and Society Program at Northeastern University. Earlier this year, Fitzgerald edited The American Prospect's April 2009 special report on \"The Green Challenge: Will Cleaner Energy Produce New Industries and Good Jobs for Americans?\" The answer, says Fitzgerald and the six other contributors to that report, is Yes\u2014provided that governments at the federal, state and local level give green manufacturing the support it needs to flourish. That means much more thanfunding specific companies; it requires crafting and implementing a comprehensive industrial policy. Such a policy, Fitzgerald writes in her piece Cities on the Front Lines, would recognize how traditional sources of manufacturing strength can serve as the base of a renewable energy economy. She cites how a former glass technology and manufacturing center like Toledo, Ohio has now become a leader in solar energy.\n\nAnd last month in an op-ed for the Boston Globe, Fitzgerald warns that absent a broad and coherent industrial vision that connects demand, supply and technology, the United States is likely to cede leadership in renewable energy production and other clean technologies to German, Japan and China.\n\nThe proposal envisions an array of energy-conservation and -generation methods used in concert to reduce the overall energy \"footprint\" of the building, from photovoltaic panels and geothermal energy generation to on-site community agriculture that would reduce the distance -- and concomitant fossil fuel use -- of residents' food. In reaching for sustainability, the Xero Energy proposal reached far beyond the 2.4-acre site they were assigned to work on as well, presenting a vision of an expansive greenway and connections to Union Station, a handsome Beaux-Arts rail station nearby.\n\nIt's not too late to catch some sessions at the National Conference in Planning History taking place at the Oakland Marriott this weekend. Organized by the Society for American City and Regional Planning History, many of the panels and tours are focused on the Bay Area, as well as their Sunday tours, which include \"Historical Development and Ethnic Change in Oakland,\" \"Urban Renewal in San Francisco\" and \"North of the Golden Gate: Growth Control, Open Space, and Alternative Agriculture on the Urban Fringe.\" The Marriott is an easy two blocks from the Oakland City Center BART station.\n\n, and protect farmland and open space."}
{"text":"to make sure your indoor air is healthy\n\nAs\n\nThink again. Air pollution is a very serious concern indoors. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists poor indoor air quality as one of the top five environmental threats. It also reports indoor air is three to five times more contaminated than outdoor air, on average.\n\n\"When warm weather rolls around, and the natural thing to do is open up your windows and bring new air into your house,\" says Matt Mongiello, president of the National Air Duct Cleaners Association. \"However, this is when allergy season is at its highest, and you're welcoming new pollutants into your home and contaminating your air with pollens.\"\n\nThese pollutants are then blown through your house five to seven times each day by your heating, ventilation and air conditioning system. And the cleaning you're doing? All those dust bunnies are just groupings of millions of little particles of dust, dander and pollen. When broken up, many of the particles go back into the air, circulate around through your house and once again collect under your sofa.\n\nSome tips to keep the air you breathe inside as clean as possible include:\n\n* Install hardwood floors versus carpeting. Carpeting traps particles, and with every step you take across it, those particles are released back into the air.\n\n* Have carpets professionally cleaned with a truck-mounted system.\n\n* Use natural- or botanical-based cleaners instead of chemicals.\n\n* Regularly change your furnace filter \u2013 most experts recommend doing this every two months. This will help remove particles circulating through the air.\n\n* Have your heating and cooling system thoroughly cleaned. This is because dust and other air pollutants collect in the vents, and then are picked up by the air stream and blown back into the house.\n\nNADCA recommends homeowners take off the cover of an air vent and look down the vent with a mirror and flashlight or a digital camera. If the ducts are covered with dust or debris, it's time for a heating and cooling system cleaning.\n\nNADCA recommends a thorough duct cleaning, as well as cleaning the evaporator coil and all parts of the system that air touches. Not only will this clean up the air inside your house, but it will also help your system work more efficiently and save you money. A study taken by Pacific Gas and Electric showed that a dirty condenser coil can result in 30 percent higher energy usage.

The base relies on commercial utilities for its electric power and natural gas needs.\n\nExtras\nLatest headlines\nNASCAR suspends driver and fianc\u00e9e after drug arrests\nSpecial counsel: Heck violated federal law\nLocal man dies after motorcycle hits deer\nBirths, marriages, divorces\nMeadowdale High student dies after stabbing in Columbus\nMost popular\nMeadowdale High student dies after stabbing in Columbus\nMan shoots through door, hits woman in neck\nReds' possible game plan: Let's make a deal\nFoul words lead to bicyclist's arrest\nReds' roster should get overhaul\nShoppers round up, hold suspected bank robber for police\nGet latest headlines via RSS feeds\nThe Air Force began operating the baghouse filters at one of the plants in 1996 after environmental regulators determined that the plant's prior emission-control system was failing to meet clean-air standards, said Jennifer Marsee, a supervisor at the Regional Air Pollution Control Agency which helps enforce state and federal clean-air standards.\n\nThe base voluntarily installed the baghouse filters at the second plant and began operating that system in 2000, Marsee said. Their emission-control use is now a part of the clean-air operating permit issued to Wright-Patterson.\n\n\"It made a huge difference in their emissions,\" Marsee said of the filter bags. \"We've seen a huge improvement.\"\n\nMaintenance season for the plants is between April, when they typically are shut down, and their return to operation in October. Ken Ferguson, boiler plant supervisor, is overseeing the maintenance, including the bag inspections.\n\nThe two plants each have three coal-fired boilers. Each boiler can contain up to 840 of the filter bags, which are 6 inches wide by 16 feet long and vaguely resemble extremely long athletic socks.\n\nMaintenance crews must empty the bags and replace those which are worn-out. The bags, made of fiberglass fabric coated with Teflon to withstand 500-degree heat, can last four to seven years.\n\nThe coal bill for last year alone was $7 million, based on the plants' 2006 consumption and the $124-per-ton market price than of the low-sulfur Kentucky coal the plants use, the plant operators said. But that still represents a cheaper heat source than electricity or natural gas, said Mark Mays, chief of the environmental management division for the 88th Air Base Wing at Wright-Patterson.\n\nThe base managed to negotiate a $98 per ton price for the coal this year, base spokesman Derek Kaufman said.\n\nFlyash waste from the coal burning is sent to a Fairborn plant for use in producing concrete, Ferguson said.\n\nBounce\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by TOMMYGUN\n\nI think we found the bottom, this one should be BOUNCING soon!\n\nFirst $3.00, then $4.00+\n\nGood \"GREEN\" play. giveNice!!\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by TOMMYGUN\n\nI see that and I agree with you.\n\nI am in for 6550 shares at $1.91.\nI got in yesterday.\n\nSounds good. I'm in a little higher, but It should overtake my entry w\/o any troubles. It was at $10 last spring, and that was before they announced theit software deal with Intel. They are patenting a carbon footprint program that they can market to other power plants. It looks like it is holding real well in this price range, and I am thinking about buying more myself. These things take time, but if they get things going better in the US and get a plant in the works in China, this will go back to $10 or more giveI wrote the co. with legit questions, and they never answered. I sold out. Let it die for all I care. The power plant and all that means nothing if they cannot make a profit and pull themselves out of debt--huge debt I might add.\n\nEEE -amazing chart turnaround play\n\nEEE-this is a big turnaround play. Stock has gone from $15 down to $1 the past couple of years on NO bad news. In fact they are rumored to be getting a Billion dollar project involving their green tech very very soon. Low float, and as you can tell by the chart it is turning up.\n\nEvergreen Energy, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides energy, environmental, and economic solutions to industrial and public utility markets in the United States and internationally. Its K-Fuel process uses heat and pressure to physically and chemically transform high moisture and low-Btu coals, such as subbituminous coal and lignite, into lower-emission fuel. The K-Fuel process also reduces mercury content, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, and carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, Evergreen licenses its technology to third parties. The company was founded in 1981. It was formerly known as KFx, Inc. and changed its name to Evergreen Energy, Inc. in 2006. Evergreen is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.\n\nI'm sorry, but this is not all true. It might not be a terrible place to get in, but don't bank on it unless they close a big deal. There is bad news, and the bad news is that they have huge debt, and there is no net income whatsoever. That is why it is where it is. Unfortunately, the billion $ deal is a rumor, otherwise I would consider getting back in. It might be moving up some because somebody does not want to see it going into major penny land. There is already an HSM thread or two on EEE, all this should be a continuation of that thread.\n\nWho knows though. If these rumors pan out, I'm sure it has possibilities. One thing you (and I) have to ask is if there are better places to put the money right now. Are there other companies with better technology since EEE came up with their ides 15 or 20 years ago. OtcGuru (on HSM) made a comment that there are better technologies out there. I called the company regarding that very issue, as well as other issues, and they did not say much on the phone, but told me to email. They have failed to answer my email, so I do not trust them. You might make a $ or two playing the ups and downs though--have fun."}
{"text":"Delhi draws up checklist to combat its dreadful air pollution\nAlthough there is no dependable database to track air pollution-related disease and death rates in Delhi, estimates premature deaths at over 10,000 per year. Delhi's relatively young population means the mortality rate is not as bad as it would otherwise be but, on the other hand, improving air quality would save more life years.\n\nThe city's new checklist is primarily focused on the transport sector that includes improvements to public transport, revision of the parking policy, promotion of pedestrian pathways and reduction of vehicular emissions through stringent action. On the cards is an annual registration for cars, an increase in road tax and a reduction in bus fares.\n\n\"Tuesday's meeting threw up several possible steps that we can take to improve air quality. In another week or so we will draw up a roadmap with implementable actions and will periodically follow those up for detailed action. Of course, vehicular pollution emerged as area requiring immediate attention,\" Keshav Chandra, Secretary for the Environment in Delhi's municipal government, told the Times of India.\n\nAmong the long-term measures that are being mooted to be in force by 2017 are the mandating of Euro V and VI standards for new vehicles and the banning fuel with a higher sulfur content than 10 parts per million.\n\n\"Pollution under control checking also needs to be revamped and we need to ensure 100% compliance. In fact, introduction of on-road emission testing for polluting vehicles was also discussed,\" said an official. He said that pollution from interstate traffic, which has a high proportion of heavily transport vehicles, will be addressed through the on-going development of bypass expressways to the east and west of the city.\n\nWith more than 1.7 million vehicles on the road in Delhi, however, the government is also reported to be seriously considering measures to dissuade people from using private vehicles. These include better integration of public transport (centered on the Delhi Metro system), better facilities for pedestrians and prohibitive parking rates.\n\nThis report by the World Bank spells out what the world would be like if it warmed by 4 degrees Celsius, which is what scientists are nearly unanimously predicting by the end of the century, without serious policy changes."}
{"text":"KARACHI - Karachi University's (KU) Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD) Dr Panjwani, has conducted an aero mycological study to monitor and analyze airborne fungal flora of Karachi environment. This is the first research analysis conducted in Pakistan using Burkard's 7-Day Recording Volumetric Spore Trap instrument.This study will be helpful to physicians, allergists in devising appropriate treatment and preventive methodologies for asthma and allergy patients. The study says, \"Airborne fungal spores are well known to cause respiratory allergic diseases particularly bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, rhino-conjunctivitis and allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis in both adults and children especially in humid cities like Karachi.\" Karachi is the largest cosmopolitan city in Pakistan, with an estimated population of 20 million people with favorable environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, heat index, dew point, wind velocity, rain) for fungal growth. The air that we breathe every day is primarily composed of viable (microorganisms) and nonviable components (dust particles and water vapors).Asthma severity is shown to be directly correlated with fungal exposure, and asthma related mortalities due to high level of fungal spore is consider as important for clinical correlation of such diseases. Overall, the prevalence of respiratory allergies caused by fungi is known to be about 20 to 30 per cent in atopic individuals, and up to 6 per cent in the general population all over the world.\"Director International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), KU, Prof Dr Muhammad Iqbal Ch said that the study was part of a project conducted at PCMD and ICCBS entitled \"Allergy and Asthma in Pakistan: Regional Variation and Impact of Aeroallergens\" funded by Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.He said, \"Tasneem Akhter, who recently got an MPhil in Molecular Medicine, is the author of the study. This work was done at a laboratory of the late Prof Dr M Anwar Waqar who was the main Principal investigator and the project is now taken over by Muhammad Ahmed Mesaik.Overall, 113, 244 spores were recorded from Karachi's environment, with the daily concentration of 310 spores per cubic meter. In total, 60 different types of fungal spores were collected from the environment. Major allergenic fungal spores in the air are Cladosporium spp (44.8 per cent) Alternaria spp. (15.5 per cent), Periconia spp (6.1 per cent), Curvularia spp (2.1 per cent), Stemphylium spp (1.3 per cent) and Aspergillus\/Penicillium type (1 per cent) emerged to be major components constituting more than 70 per cent of the airborne fungal flora. Other minor components include grass smut, Agrocybe, Torula, Xylaria, Chaetomium, Arthrinium, Rust, Sordaria, and Massarina besides many others."}
{"text":"Air pollution\n\nThere are vast effects of air pollution, ranging from short to long term, that are hazardous to the human health. Air pollution poses a considerable human health risk, causing serious respiratory problems and other illnesses. Studies have shown that the number of deaths resulting from air pollution alone in the US could amount up to over 50,000.\n\nAcid Rain\n\nAcid rain is precipitation (rain, snow, mists) that has become acidified after reacting with the sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere that is emitted mainly by factories and cars. It is a result of air pollution and has adverse effects on the ecosystems, water contamination, marine life, and erodes buildings. Many of Britain's freshwater fish are at risk and studies have shown mutated fish being hatched, which in turn affects the corresponding food chains. Acid rain slows down the growth of trees or may even result in death. This is due to the rain (a)dissolving or washing away useful nutrients and minerals in the soil, (b)releasing harmful substances such as aluminum into the soil and (c)wear away the waxy protective coating of leaves, thus damaging them and make photosynthesis less efficient. The effects of acid rain are most obvious in aquatic habitats where the water becomes acidic and the sea life starts to die or even deform newly hatched fish. Toxic consumption of sea life will in turn take a toll on us, humans as discussed in water pollution. Acid rain also quickens the process of the erosion of materials used to build buildings (statues, vehicles, pipes).\n\nHazardous Gases\n\nPoisonous pollutants present in the air may also affect our health and behavior. Carbon monoxide, for example, forces oxygen out of our bloodstream, causing lethargy, headaches, disorientation, and decrease our muscular coordination and acuteness of sight\n\nPhotochemical Smog\n\nAir pollution results in photochemical smog, damaging and destroying synthetic materials. This smog can cause irritation to the nose, eyes and respiratory functions, possibly causing you to have potential fits. Young children have been found to suffer from pain in chest, dyspnea, numbness in limbs, and convulsions which require hospital treatment. This is especially the case after the course of an intense outdoor activity. Albeit low concentration of pollutants, the outcome can be exaggerated after an intense activity.\n\nOzone layer\n\nDepletion of the ozone layer is a large cause for concern. This can intensify the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching us, where it not only destroys harvest and vegetation but also induce skin cancer and cataracts. The depletion of the ozone layer is mainly caused by the emission of chlorofluorocarbons from air conditioners, refrigerators, and aerosols."}
{"text":"The 10 Dirtiest Cities in America\n\nBeing born in one of the most polluted areas in the world \u2013 Southern California \u2013 led my mother to move to Jackson Hole, Wyoming to help alleviate my asthmatic symptoms. Interestingly enough, the maneuver worked, and I have been since interested in the health effects of \"dirty\" cities ever since. Let's take a look at the top 10 most polluted cities as reported by Forbes in November.\n\nWhat is a \"dirty\" City?\n\nParticle pollution, according to the American Lung Association, is a combination of \"tiny specks of soot, dust, and aerosols that are suspended in the air we breathe.\" Particle pollution can have some serious implications on your health. In fact, studies by both the EPA and World Health Organization have shown that both indoor and outdoor particulate matter, especially fine particulate matter (as opposed to ultra fine or coarse), have direct effect on longevity and morality rates in cities.\n\nShort-term particle pollution speaks to pollution that lasts over hours or days, while long-term particle pollution speaks to pollution that lasts for longer periods like a year. Short-term particle pollution ranks are based on \"spikes in their daily measurements and were calculated using weighted averages; each level of the Air Quality index was given a numerical weight, and these values were then multiplied by the number of days each metro reached them.\"\n\nThe same method was used for the ozone pollution rank.\n\nRegarding long-term or year-round pollution, \"rankings are based on the average daily airborne particle levels during the three years studied.\"\n\nMore Articles Like This\n\n6 Comments\n\nThere are currently 6 Comments on The 10 Dirtiest Cities in America. Perhaps you would like to add one of your own?\n\nChristina Byard\n\nApril 11, 2011 at 2:23 pm\n\nSigh. I grew up in Bakersfield and still have many family members who live there. The reasons for the air quality problems in the San Joaquin valley are many, but the major culprit is industrial agriculture. As the \"salad bowl\" of the nation, the San Joaquin Valley grows and ships out the majority of produce purchased in the U.S. It is frustrating to watch everyone happily buy up the inexpensive, chemically-laden produce of the area and then turn their noses up at the residents of the areas in which they were grown, wondering how anyone could ever live there. If we demanded organic practices and a diverse approach to farming that was not so reliant on petroleum-based fuels and fertilizers, the air in the SJV would improve dramatically!\n\nBakersfield, Bakersfield\u2026 My grandparents lived there from 1952 to 1987. We visited once a month in the 70s. Went there last summer. In addition to dust, the smell of raw petroleum impregnates the air now.\nI do not recall petroleum smell back int the 70s. I do not recall dust inside or out of my grandparents house.\n\nLiving in LA in the 70s with smog so bad you could not even take a deep breath, I looked forward to the clean air of Bakersfield. Just cannot believe it !!!!!\n\nJesse's asthma was so bad his lungs would fill up with fluid and he would gag and cough in order to expel it, as his mother it was truly horrifying. He wheezed and had trouble sleeping and if he got a cold I barely felt comfortable leaving his side. Jesse was 5 when we moved to Jackson Hole and at that point become one of those \"inside kids\" video games, movies, cartoons and playing in his room while other children ran around kicking the ball. The already quiet child was becoming more and more introverted due to his struggles with breathing and health. Moving to Jackson changed everything,within months after moving there Jesse was down hill skiing and running around playing with all his new friends. His health changed instantly. As he got older and joined the Boy Scouts he slept in ice caves, went on multi day boating excursions and was\/is an avid hiker. FYI for those of you not in the know \u2013 there air is much thinner up there in those mountains. He never had a problem with breathing again even when he had a 50 lb backback strapped to his thin frame.\n\nIf it were not for this article or holiday dinners when memories of things past are discussed, I would forget altogether he even had a breathing problem.\n\nThere are only two options left with the dirt in Los Angeles.\nClean it up or as they said in the film Battlefield LA when the aliens were winning \u2013\n\"Abandon Los Angeles\" \uf04c\n\nSo in spite of all the regulations and restrictions on what the populace and businesses can and cannot drive, use, work with, etc. California still has 7 of the top 10 dirtiest places. Hmm. Maybe California regulations are the problem. Food for thought!"}
{"text":"The Children's Health Guide is for parents who are concerned about the risk which air pollution poses for infants and young children. Because children and infants are still developing their immune and respiratory systems, it is critical for parents to know the effects that exposure to pollutants, what you can do to minimize such health risks, and the danger of diesel school buses.\n\nCHILDREN & AIR POLLUTION\nChildren and infants are at greater risk from air pollution than adults for many reasons. Children tend to breathe more rapidly and inhale more pollutants per pound of body weight. Babies' and children's bodies, lungs and immune systems are still developing and more prone to air pollution's ill effects. Children also spend more time exercising outside, especially during summer months when smog levels are highest.\n\nHeavy exercising also means that children breathe through their mouths more. The nose provides a natural way to filter particulates from reaching the lungs, the mouth does not. This is a problem for anyone exercising outside.\n\nChildren with existing respiratory problems, such as asthma, may have more health problems while exposed to air pollution. There are also other differences between people that make some of us more vulnerable to the health effects of air pollution, but nobody knows why. Also, children may not complain as much as adults about air pollution symptoms, and will continue to play in harmful conditions.\n\nExposure to air pollution at an early age can affect the development of respiratory, nervous, endocrine and immune systems, and increase the chance of cancer later in life. According to the American Lung Association, children living in extremely polluted areas have more respiratory infections, and these infections could lead to lung disease in adulthood.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO TO LESSEN YOUR CHILD'S EXPOSURE\n\nKnow how healthy your child is. If your child has asthma or other respiratory problems, make sure they are seeing a doctor about it, and take any medications prescribed by the doctor. Ask your doctor if your child should take these medications before exercising. Know how active your child is. Your child should not play or exercise strenuously when pollution is heavy, especially aerobic activity, like running. Know local weather conditions. Heat and humidity can make symptoms worse; reversals in the usual wind flow or very hot windless days may have increased air pollution. Check the weather report for information on air quality. In the Bay Area, pollution may be the worst during winter mornings. Check for air pollution reports. Bay Area Air Quality Management District keeps track and alerts people to heavy air pollution conditions. There are newspaper, TV and radio listings. BAAQMD and the Spare the Air program will even email you the report - just go to \n\nDIESEL SCHOOL BUSES AND OUR CHILDREN Diesel school and transit buses are major sources of harmful pollution in California. Two percent of California vehicles are diesel powered, yet they produce 31% of the smog-forming nitrous oxide and 79% of the total particulate matter or soot, produced by on-road vehicles.\n\nSmog and soot present major health risks, especially to children. Our children should not have to risk their health in order to get to school, nor should they be exposed to soot-spewing city buses. Yet California school districts rely on outdated, heavily polluting diesel school buses that emit 200 times as much toxic air pollution as the cleanest available bus engines.\n\nWorking with parent and teacher organizations, we will encourage our school districts to phase out polluting diesel buses in favor of school buses that run on natural gas, the cleanest technology available. At the same time, we will urge transit agencies to phase out diesel and phase in natural gas vehicles."}

{"text":"Jaeah Lee\n\nAssociate Interactive Producer\n\nWhen Jaeah isn't making mockups, researching, or blogging for Mother Jones, she's usually reading about foreign policy, climate change, or new dinner recipes. A lover of mass transit, she can pretty much navigate the New York City subway blindfolded.\n\nPrior to joining Mother Jones, Jaeah worked as a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, focusing on China. Her writings have appeared in the Christian Science Monitor, Global Post, Huffington Post, Talking Points Memo, and Movements.org.\n\nA new study puts a hefty price tag on climate change by linking it to the air you breathe. The report, published yesterday by the Union of Concerned Scientists, concludes that CO2-induced temperature increases will worsen ground-level ozone concentrations (the kind coming from power plants and exhaust pipes, not the kind that shields the Earth from UV rays). Higher concentrations of ground-level ozone threaten the health of millions of Americans, an impact that could cost the US $5.4 billion in 2020. If that's not compelling enough, here's what the study's findings mean for you:\n\nIf you live in the following states: California, Texas, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Virginia topped the list of most vulnerable populations under the projected ozone concentration increase of 2 parts per billion per 1 degree of temperature increase.\n\nIf you have asthma: Higher ground-level ozone concentrations could lead to 2.8 million additional occurrences of asthma attacks, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest pains in 2020 compared to today.\n\nIf you go to school: Many schools already prevent students from going outside and cancel sports games due to poor air quality. UCS projects that in 2020 higher ozone concentrations could lead to 944,000 more school absences than today.\n\nIf you're older than 65 or younger than 1: In 2050, an average of 24,000 more seniors and 5,700 more infants than today could be hospitalized for respiratory problems linked to air quality.\n\nIf you're an athlete, work outdoors, or live in a low-income community or in any of the 322 counties that do not meet the current national ozone standard, then you're also at high risk. And if you're a farmer, ozone pollution in rural areas may also lower your crop yields.\n\nSo what to do? There's the obvious, like riding a bike or taking mass transit instead of driving. Also, you could avoid mowing your lawn on bad ozone days. In late July, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce a stronger ozone standard as well as new proposed rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. But the EPA has already delayed tightening its ozone standards three times, and now the coal power plant industry and related labor unions are lobbying Congress to delay the air pollution rules. Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), Rep. Ed Whitfield (R-Kent.), and Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who have previously tried to reverse the EPA's ability to regulate air pollution under the Clean Air Act, have asked the EPA to delay or abandon the rules.\n\nIn any case, it might all be too little, too late. The majority of states in the US consistently violate the EPA's existing limit on ozone concentration. And there is virtually no entity that sets standards these issues at the county and state levels, report co-author Jerome Paulson said in a press conference call. He adds that \"there are essentially no national level recommendations,\" either, because none of the federal agencies have the authority to legally mandate them.\n\nThis summer, says UCS public health expert Liz Perera, nearly 50 percent of Americans will breathe air with unsafe ozone levels. The figure will probably increase with time, since hotter temperatures could easily mean higher demand for air conditioners and more demand for electricity during summer months, thus resulting in more emissions from fossil-fueled power plants.\n\nYou could call it dream pop. Or shoegazing. Music you could fall asleep to. Asobi Seksu lead singer Yuki Chikudate's soft-soprano voice transcends time and space, channeling tones that compel you \"to turn off all the lights, put some candles on, and drift into heaven.\" Layer that with the ebb and flow of rolling drums, heavy guitar riffs, and adorn it with the jingles of a tamborine, and you get what drummer Larry Gorman calls \"a big sonic expression.\" If supernovas made noise, this would come pretty close.\n\nAsobi Seksu (Japanese for \"playful sex\") doesn't fit squarely into a single genre, and so it ends up being described by phrases rather than single adjectives: \"a hyper-stylized and glitzy graphic design sense,\" for example. And despite the band's name, Chikudate's lineage, and her tendency to sing in Japanese, Asobi Seksu isn't quite the Shibuya import that some like to label it. Many of the band's biggest influences hail from places closer to its Brooklyn home, from Yo La Tengo (Hoboken, NJ) and Sonic Youth (NYC) to Tom Waits (Pomona) and The Beach Boys (So. Cal.). Which makes sense, considering Chikudate grew up in Los Angeles and has lived in the Big Apple since she was 16\u2014not to mention Gorman's lifelong affection for the late punk-and-blues haven, CBGB.\n\nTonight, the band returns to San Francisco's Bottom of the Hill for an encore show as it tours in support of its latest (well-received) album, Fluorescence. In the clip below, Chikudate (with Gorman) tells me about learning to sing, moving to New York, and why you should never say \"asobi seksu\" to a Japanese person.\n\nThe Atlantic bluefin tuna's days could be numbered. The tuna's spawning population, which used to thrive in the Gulf of Mexico, has for decades been on a steep decline due to overfishing, shrinking by more than 80 percent since 1970. While acknowledging this trend, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced today that the Atlantic populations of bluefin tuna did not warrant federal protection under the Endangered Species Act, at least for now. From the agency's press release:\n\nNOAA's status review...indicates that based on the best available information and assuming countries comply with the bluefin tuna fishing quotas established by ICCAT, both the western and eastern Atlantic stocks are not likely to become extinct.\n\nThat's a big assumption to make, especially considering that national fishing fleets routinely breach the standards set by ICCAT (the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas). ICCAT's standards, moreover, tend to be much weaker than what scientists recommend: In November, the commission set the species' annual fishing limit at about 14,200 tons, but the World Wildlife Fund recommends less than half that amount. NOAA's decision is particularly puzzling because in 2010 the US was one of three countries to support a proposal to the United Nations to ban international trade of bluefin tuna until it rebounds in number, which was voted down after facing strong opposition from major tuna consumers like Japan.\n\nOne reason NOAA posits for rejecting the bluefin tuna protection is the declining number of tuna caught in the US, arguing that domestic catch levels have consistently fallen well below its ICCAT-designated quota. But that isn't really a matter of choice, since the tuna's population in the Gulf and West Atlantic Ocean have already declined so significantly. There simply aren't fish left to catch.\n\nA petition, filed last May by the Center for Biological Diversity, also raised concerns about the BP Deepwater Horizon's effect on bluefin, following the European Space Agency's finding that the spill had reduced the young bluefin tuna by 20 percent. And as Mother Jones correspondent Julia Whitty reported last fall, the spill's damages to deep-sea creatures (bluefin tuna included) could be far worse than we think.\n\nBut for now, NOAA has decided the study was flawed and inconclusive, and that it will wait to see what the agency's Natural Resources Damage Assessment has to say in 2012 about the BP spill's impact on the fisheries.\n\nWhile listening to Yelle, you may sense a loose combination of urges to laugh, cry, and slap an ex-lover. The confused feelings can be frustrating (disregarding the fact that all of the songs are in French), since whatever your state of mind, you will not be able shake off the urge to dance. The French synth-pop trio\u2014singer Julie Budet and producers GrandMarnier (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Perrier) and Tepr (Tanguy Destable)\u2014delivers stretchy keyboard sounds punctuated by a steady booming beat and the occasional crack of a whip. Budet's youthful, silky voice ties it all into a neat package that is at once playful, rebellious, flirtatious, and meloncholic.\n\nAfter the success of Yelle's first album, Pop Up, in 2007, the group is back with Safari Disco Club, reminding us that it can pack a mean punch despite being in a genre that is often taken as seriously as bubblegum and pigtails. Some American fans have already likened the 28-year-old Budet to Madonna, Britney Spears, and Lady Gaga\u2014minus their overwrought drama.\n\nOnstage at San Francisco's Regency Ballroom this past Thursday night, Yelle was a refreshing change. A petite-and-well-sculpted Budet, clad in a skintight red leopard-print body suit, danced around happily, unbound by choreography, in that girls-just-want-to-have-fun-gone-femme-fatale manner. Every now and then she donned a matching animal-print hood to create an air of mystery, and give a nod to her '80s hip-hop\/Fresh Prince of Bel-Air phase. At the end of the show, she excitedly invited fans to meet the band outside.\n\nOff stage, Budet was as comfortable and familiar as an old friend or a worn-in pair of jeans. Below, she takes a break from her pre-show sound check to talk about living the \"simple life,\" baking, and Yelle's new video.\n\nFires occur at US nuclear plants a total of ten times a year on average, but most sites are underprepared for the event of a disaster, according to two reports published today by ProPublica and iWatch News. The independent reviews highlight how over the last three decades, industry neglect and gaps in regulatory enforcement have contributed to the risk of fire-induced nuclear accidents at the 104 existing plants across the country. The reports come in the wake of the March earthquake that triggered a leak at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi reactor, which has resulted in the country freezing its own nuclear power expansion plans. Here are some of the reports' most alarming findings:\n\nFires are often triggered by accidents as likely as a short circuit in an electric cable or a spark igniting oil in a pump.\n\nMost existing safety plans focus on containing and putting out fires rather than preventing them, and rely on time-consuming manual actions like sending in a worker to activate a pump that will ensure a reactor is shut down.\n\nAt two dozen of the nation's reactors, spent fuel are stored in unsecured, above-ground pools with potential lethal waste exceeding those stored in Japan. (If a cooler at one of the reactors were to break down, spent fuel could overheat or catch on fire, releasing radiation that could kill people living within 50 miles of the plant.)\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the main nuclear safety enforcement body, has in the past resisted issuing citations to violators, and when it does often exempts them from paying penalties, numbering more than 900 exemptions as of 2001. The NRC does not keep its own list of fire safety gaps, but instead relies on plants to provide them during inspections.\n\nMost plants are ill equipped to stamp out large-scale fires; reactor owners get away with using electrical cables wrapped in fire-proof materials that have previously failed safety tests.\n\nNuclear plant fires have not killed any Americans to date, which might explain why the hazard has been downplayed. But shortcomings like fire protection violations make disasters more likely, the Union of Concerned Scientists' David Lochbaum told ProPublica. And as the map below shows, nuclear reactors are clustered in some of the most dense areas of the US, meaning the risk of fire is simply too dangerous to go unaddressed. \"The NRC is to nuclear power today what the SEC was to Wall Street three years ago,\" Richard Brodsky, a former Westchester, NY assemblyman told iWatch."}

{"text":"Question: Science\n\nWhen pollutants (from cars, factories, etc...) are released into the atmosphere part of their chemical components include nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and sulfur (to name a few). These components react with each other and in the presence of the sun a potent mix of ozone and other chemicals are created. This is caused photochemical smog. Acid raid occurs when rain mixes with these photochemicals and are transported to earth via the rain.

{"text":"Two New Reasons to Worry about Air Pollution: Obesity and Diabetes\n\nThe debate over air pollution and, more specifically, the regulation of air pollution, raged on this week as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) watered down its cross-state pollution rule and House Republicans moved to delay new rules on toxic air pollution from cement plants, solid waste incinerators, and industrial boilers. These latest debates come on the heels of President Obama's move last month to reneg on promises to tighten up smog standards, a decision that angered environmentalists and led to speculation that EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson might be ready to walk. In all cases, the argument against regulation goes something like this: The last thing a down economy needs is new regulation, and the EPA is overstepping its boundaries.\n\nThese arguments center largely around the idea that current air pollution regulation is good enough as-is, and that any further restrictions are aimed at tackling environmental issues and climate change, both typically seen as luxuries in a down economy. But research is continuing to pile up in support of the claim that not only are current air pollution regulations inadequate, but that air pollution is very much a public health issue.\n\nWhen viewed through the public health lens, the economic arguments against regulation of air pollution begin to unravel, particularly in the face of rising healthcare costs. Consider, for example, a spate of new studies that have found a rather convincing correlation between the presence of small particulate matter (PM2.5, the fine particles blown into the air by road traffic, coal-fired power plants, industrial manufacturing, and residential wood fuel combustion) and both obesity and diabetes.\n\nMedical research has long supported the fact that exposure to fine particulate matter increases the risk of various respiratory, cardiovascular, and pulmonary illnesses. Incidences of asthma, heart attacks, and chronic bronchitis are all higher in areas where the concentration of fine particulate matter is higher. The correlation between particulate matter and these health issues is particularly pronounced in children, as well as low-income communities, which are often located closer to the sources of particulate matter (highways, factories, power plants) than their higher income neighbors.\n\nOver the past decade, new studies have emerged that link air pollution to two of this country's most pressing (and expensive) health epidemics: obesity and type II diabetes. Both are not only on the rise in terms of diagnoses, but also in terms of the costs associated with treatment. According to a January 2011 study by the Society of Actuaries, the current cost of the obesity epidemic in the United States is $270 billion a year. The American Diabetes Association puts the current cost of dealing with diabetes (over 90 percent of U.S. diabetes cases are type II) at $174 billion. According to the Center for Disease Control, asthma is a leading cause of school absenteeism in the United States, and the cost of treating asthma in children 18 and under alone is $3.2 billion per year. Meanwhile, financial analysts estimate the cost of tightened air pollution regulations at $130 billion. Granted, these are not budget line items that are easily swapped in for each other, but a tie-in to obesity and diabetes may just make tackling air pollution more economically viable.\n\nOf course, no one is saying, \"hey, forget about diet and exercise, just take care of air pollution!\" Nonetheless, even after controlling for factors such as genetics, income levels, weight, diet and exercise, Harvard researchers found a \"consistent and significant\" relationship between Type II diabetes prevalence and exposure to fine particulate matter in a recent study.\n\nWe actually expected there to be only a loose relationship there [between type II diabetes and air pollution], so we expected it to begin to fall apart as we looked at other risk factors,\" says Harvard researcher John F. Pearson. \"It was surprising to find that it held up the more we drilled into it.\n\nResults of an animal study published by Ohio State University researcher Qinghua Sun in late 2010 revealed that early exposure to fine particulates led to the accumulation of abdominal fat and insulin resistance in mice even if they ate a normal diet. Exposure levels for animals in the study were similar to those found in U.S. cities. It's important to note that the EPA does already regulate fine particulate matter, but recent studies are finding that the levels currently deemed \"acceptable\" remain a threat to health on various levels.\n\nThis is one of the first, if not the first, study to show that these fine particulates directly cause inflammation and changes in fat cells, both of which increase the risk for Type 2 diabetes,\" said Sun, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at Ohio State University, in an announcement of the study's results.\n\nThe study compared mice fed a high-fat diet with those fed a normal, healthy diet, and exposed some members of both groups daily to fine particulate matter, controlling for all other factors. In the end, all of the mice exposed to air pollution, including those fed a normal diet, had increased abdominal and subcutaneous (under the skin) fat.\n\nThese findings suggest that fine particulate pollution exposure alone, in the presence of a normal diet, may lead to an increase in fat cell size and number, and also have a proinflammatory effect,\" said Sanjay Rajagopalan, senior author of the study and the John W. Wolfe Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Ohio State.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs decided that the link between air-borne dioxin (an ingredient in Agent Orange, and also a common air-borne pollutant emitted by waste incineration, some chemical manufacturing processes, cars and trucks, and other industrial sources that burn fuel) and diabetes was so strong, it compensated 270,000 veterans for diabetes linked to dioxin exposure.\n\nIncreasingly, health research seems to be pointing to a need for stricter regulation of air pollution.\n\nPM2.5 [fine particulate matter] is regulated specifically because of its health impacts, so it's already recognized as a risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and lung disease,\" says John S. Brownstein, PHD, co-author of the Harvard study. \"What was surprising is that even with EPA regulation there was still this gradient from the areas that were less polluted to those that were within the EPA limits, but at the higher end of the limit.\n\n* Author's note: Many thanks to Environmental Health News for pointing out an error in the original version of this story. PM2.5 is classified as \"fine particulate matter,\" not \"ultrafine\" as it was initially identified in this piece. Ultrafine particulate matter refers to nanoscale particulate matter, smaller than 0.1 micron (100 nanometers) in size. While PM2.5 is regulated by the EPA, ultrafine particles are not. We regret the errorikes!! For 25 plus years, the EPA has been threatening to take action. Simply search \"coal fired plants\" across this great land, they dot the landscape. Some plants with poor installed coal emission abatement have been dumping pollutants for years. Results range from A to Zzzz, asthma to early demise and most chronic ailments in between are being linked to bad air. Great for the grandkids, eh? No European country would put up with this; but here we continue to aid and abet known massive polluters (tree killers too!). Don't take my word for this! Google \"the dangers of burning coal\".\n\nBurgeoning girths round the midsection most likely assisted by man made food additives used to extend shelf life. Not healthful ingredients.\n\nSeriously, does the govt. want us ill so Big Pharma can profit even more by pickpocketing every other company paying healthcare costs plus the Medicare System?\n\nThink of the ramifications: Harder and harder for American companies to compete on the world stage with this way out-of-balance healthcare and worker costs caused by a lot of questionable governance, yes?\n\nLet's not forget that the atmospheric pollution is burdening our general health, psychological and physical, therefore especially to people who are already burdened with serious illnesses, it is reasonable to have health problems and disastrous consequences. Since the polluted air is containing heavy metals, and with the breath, we inject them right into our body, my opinion is, especially for people in cities, to start a drastic diet, systemic detoxification and raise the standard of their life level.\n\nMost Read on Forbes\n\nI'm a freelance journalist covering the environment from various angles for publications such as Slate.com, Sunset, and Consumers Digest.

{"text":"Science News\n\nOct. 13, 2009 \u2014 A new mobile air research laboratory will help a team of researchers led by a Michigan State University professor better understand the damaging health effects of air pollution and why certain airborne particles - emitted from plants and vehicles - induce disease and illness.\n\nShare This:\n\nJack Harkema, a University Distinguished Professor of pathobiology and diagnostic investigation in the College of Veterinary Medicine, will deploy the new 53-foot, 36,000-pound center - dubbed \"AirCARE 2\" - throughout southern Michigan, including metropolitan Detroit.\n\n\"The mobile laboratory allows us to analyze 'real-world' pollution in communities that may be at risk,\" he said. \"We can study why certain ailments, such as asthma, cardiovascular disease and even obesity, may be more pronounced after exposure to particulate air pollution.\"\n\nWith about 450 square feet of indoor laboratory space, the $400,000 center helps researchers study fine and ultrafine particles in air pollution. These small particles have been found to increase mortality and morbidity among susceptible people with pre-existing health conditions such as heart disease.\n\nHoused in a converted semitrailer, the mobile laboratory pulls air from the surrounding atmosphere through an air-particle concentrator, allowing the scientists to selectively collect the particles and analyze for chemical components that may be responsible for damaging health effects.\n\nResearchers can study the subtle effects of controlled particle exposure on both laboratory animals and human subjects, providing clues on why and how pollutant particles are so harmful to the heart and lungs. Harkema works closely with environmental and biomedical researchers from the University of Michigan on the projects.\n\n\"We know particles in the air can exacerbate pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease in people,\" Harkema said. \"We need to understand why. There are many different components to air pollution, and we want to determine which of these are most harmful and where there come from.\"\n\nThe addition of the new mobile laboratory allows Harkema and U-M collaborators Robert Brook, a cardiologist, and Gerald Keeler, an atmospheric scientist, to conduct a new study funded by the Environmental Protection Agency. As part of the project, Harkema, Brook and Keeler will deploy AirCARE 2 in rural southeastern Michigan to study the cardiovascular health effects of transported air pollution originating from distant emission sites in Michigan or adjacent states.\n\nAirCARE 2 was partly funded through the MSU strategic partnership grant, the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station, the College of Veterinary Medicine and the Office of the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies. The new fine particle concentrator in the AirCARE 2 received some funds from the Electric Power Research Institute and the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nThe first MSU Mobile Air Research Laboratory, AirCARE 1, currently spends six months of the year in metro Detroit conducting air pollution studies and then six months in Los Angeles as part of a six-university partnership known as the federal Southern California Particle Center in California. The $8 million partnership, funded by the EPA and led by UCLA, is a five-year endeavor to investigate how exposure to airborne particles affects health and how the impact varies with the source, chemical composition and physical size.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nHow Trees Play Role in Smog Production(Apr. 25, 2013) \u2014 After years of scientific uncertainty and speculation, researchers have shown exactly how trees help create one of society's predominant environmental and health concerns: air ... > read more"}
{"text":"killer air exposes wider EU problems\n\nChronic pollution makes Bulgaria one of the world's deadliest places to live because of poor air quality, despite years of efforts to improve monitoring and comply with EU standards. But Bulgaria's problems are not isolated and reflect broader concerns over air quality among EU member states.\n\nBulgaria has made steady progress in improving environmental monitoring and adopting regulations on air, water and environmental quality since joining the EU in 2007.\n\nAnalysts say such steps have been followed by hollow enforcement and neglect by both national and EU authorities.\n\n\"We have very good laws and monitoring systems in place, but the biggest problem is we have no state agency that can enforce the laws,\" said Georgi Stefanov, policy and climate change officer for the environmental group WWF. \"We have everything but enforcement.\"\n\nAs the European Commission begins to weigh changes to the EU's 2008 air quality directive, analysts say Bulgaria \u2013 like many other EU countries \u2013 is failing at enforcement.\n\nThe Commission is expected to revamp its air quality standards no later than 2013.\n\nHeavy industrialisation left a toxic legacy in Bulgaria at the end of communism in 1989, but today's problems centre on outmoded energy and industrial infrastructure, and an ageing transport fleet.\n\nPoverty also contributes, says Stefanov, with large pockets of itinerant communities dependent on wood and other fuels for heating and cooking \u2013 spewing hazards to both indoor and outdoor air quality.\n\nPoor air quality has deadly consequences in Bulgaria as well as Romania, which trail only Armenia in having the world's second highest mortality rates from urban air pollution, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\n\nThe UNDP's 2011 Human Development Report, released on 2 November, shows that while the annual death rate from poor air quality is slightly higher in Romania (439 deaths per million people compared to 437 in Bulgaria), Bulgaria leads Europe in the intensity of air pollution, ranking in the top one-quarter of the most polluted of the 187 countries included in the report.\n\nOnly Armenia has a higher annual mortality rate than the two EU countries \u2013 882 per million population in a country of 3 million people.\n\nThe UNDP's findings drive home the extreme risks of polluted air beyond Bulgaria, which has an urban pollution level that is double the regional average. EU candidate Turkey also has high levels of urban pollution, 37 microgrammes per cubic meter, exceeding the regional average of 25 microgrammes per cubic meter, says the report.\n\nAnd within the current EU, the Commission has taken action against 20 EU members for air quality violations.\n\nNo monopoly on bad air\n\nThough the EU air quality directive is due for a revamp, some health experts say indoor and outdoor air quality do not get enough attention.\n\n\"Many of the policy decisions that are currently being made often neglect or fail to take into account health concerns sufficiently,\" said Juha Pekkanen, a physician who heads the environmental health department at the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Finland.\n\nPekkanen says air pollution is a serious health threat, noting that as many as 2,000 Finns die each year because of long-term exposure to particulate matter. He urges stronger policies aimed at cutting air pollution through cleaner-burning fuels and improvements in energy and transport efficiency.\n\nEnvironmentalists also fear that often-conflicting EU and national rules \u2013 from a focus on diesel and biofuels in transport, to energy policies that still subsidise the coal industry \u2013 neglect the need for air-quality improvements.\n\nAir pollutants that include sulphur dioxide emitted from burning coal to lead contained in motor fuels contributed to the premature deaths of 370,000 across Europe in 2000. And even with stronger air quality standards aimed at drastic reductions in toxins, the European Environment Agency (EEA) estimates the death rate will still be 230,000 in 2020.\n\nEEA statistics show that in the past decade, 20% to 50% of city dwellers in the EU were exposed to levels of particulates in excess of the daily standards, contributing to short-term effects such as itchy eyes and sinus problems to long-term respiratory, heart ailments and cancer.\n\nBut policies, no matter how well-meaning, don't always yield the best results. The EU has pushed diesel over gasoline because it is more efficient and emits less carbon dioxide, even though it produces more particulate pollution that is harmful to humans. Biofuels are cleaner than their fossil-fuel counterparts, yet there is an open debate about whether their production is more harmful to air quality as well as their impact on land and water resources.\n\nEven shifting sentiments about the safety of nuclear energy can result in reversal for air quality. In the short term, countries like Belgium and Germany that are vowing a phase-out of atomic power will need fossil fuels to fill the gap between demand on supply.\n\nBad air days in Bulgaria\n\nBulgaria, meanwhile, is credited with dramatic improvements in pollution monitoring and, following earlier frictions, working with Romania to develop pollution monitoring in border communities along the Danube in an effort to comply with UN agreements on transboundary pollution.\n\nYet Bulgaria has a long way to go to put in practice what national laws and EU rules put on paper. Last year, the Commission warned the country that it was violating limits on sulphur dioxide, typically emitted by coal plants, an ingredient in acid rain and in high concentrations, can cause serious respiratory problems in humans.\n\nWWF's Stefanov says he routinely complains to authorities in his Sofia neighbourhood about illegal fires \u2013 from burning refuse to tyres set alight so the metal can be recovered for recycling \u2013 to little avail.\n\nOlder vehicles \u2013 mostly imported from other EU countries \u2013 contribute to urban smog, he says, something that could be addressed through a premium tax on polluting cars. The government and municipalities have been slower than private companies to modernise publicly owned electricity and heating plants with smokestack scrubbers.\n\nHe sees little political resolve with much political energy spent on economic growth and job-creation.\n\n\"Not one of our politicians is connecting air pollution to health,\" he said, a day after the 30 October presidential and local elections in the country. And he said the European Commission is too complacent in enforcing air quality and other environmental rules.\n\n\"They wait, wait, wait until it is too late.\"\n\nNext steps:\n\nJanuary-mid-2012: Consultation phase on revisions to the EU's air quality directive.\n\nEarly 2013: Revised directive to European Parliament for consideration.\n\nWhat is this article aiming ?\nHow much pollution is produced in Bulgaria ?\nWhat heavy industry has Bulgaria ?\nHow does this survey was made ?\"Bulgaria leads Europe in the intensity of air pollution ?\nOnly talking there are no facts, Please expose your sources ?\nHow much people heat up with wood and coal ? Are they making fire in there flats, to cook ?\nWhat is the percentage that lives in big cities, and what is left in the small cities and villages ?\nBig interest is playing here, someone wants alternative way of heating to be forbidden, so ALL people to use an atomic energy.\nThe picture is global not just EU countries.\nAnd which way You think is the most DANGEROUS - AIR KILLING, I WILL TELL YOU, \"THIS IS THE NUCLEAR ENERGY\"\nWhy this agency didn't make a survey of how the radiation from Fukushima or Chernobil has effected the people all over the world, and is taking on Bulgaria ??\nWhoever wrote this article, please don't come to Bulgaria, go to Fukushima the AIR THERE WILL BE VERY HEALTHY FOR YOU :)Well, emissions from burning fossil fuels in transport sector is what's killing people in Bulgarian large cities, as it is in rest of the world, so... no difference here. Only small factories are present nowadays in Bulgaria. There are large electric plants burning coal though. My guess is that is bad for air quality. Few nasty production processes as everywhere and that's it. Bring us EV's with good battery milage and we will adopt some wind turbine for free electricity - air polution problem solved and those impending dead people can still live. It is so simple indeed.Air pollution has different particulate matter (PM) components \u2013 smoke, dirt and dust form coarse particles known as PM10, and metals and toxic exhaust from smelting, vehicle exhaust, power plants and refuse burning forming fine particles called PM2.5.\n\nThe 2008 air quality directive aimed at streamlining and tightening EU legislation dealing with pollution and air standards. It is due to be revised by 2013, and Environment Commissioner Janez Poto\u010dnik seeks to consolidate many different EU regulations on air quality and pollution into a single law.\n\nThe 2008 rules set targets for reducing concentrations of fine particles that health officials say are dangerous pollutants for human health and that contribute to respiratory, sinus and other problems.\n\nUnder the directive member states must cut exposure to fine particulate matter by an average of 20% by 2020, based on 2010 levels.\n\nMany of the policies grow out of a 2005 strategy on air pollution, which sought to cut sulpher dioxide (SO2) emissions by 82%, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 60%, volatile organic compounds by 51%, ammonia by 27%, and primary fine particulates by 59% compared to the levels of 2000.\n\nHealth advocates says the cost of cutting emissions through better smokestack scrubbers, cleaner-burning vehicles and a shift to renewable fuels would be more than offset by savings in treating complications of bad air."}
{"text":"AIR & HEAVY METALS\n\nParticulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5)\n\nA PM2.5 Sampler\n\nNew Mexico measures Particulate Matter. Particulate matter (PM) consists of\nvery small liquid and solid particles. Particulate Matter is a kind of pollution\nthat consists of things floating in the air. Most of the PM floating in the air\nyou cannot see. PM found in the air include these very small liquid and solid\nparticles we commonly know as dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. PM\ncan cause such physical responses as coughing, sneezing, painful breathing and\ncan aggravate asthma. Particulate Matter may be the air pollutant that affects\npeople's health more often than any other.\n\nThe\nfilter weighing rooms are climate controlled and static controlled.\n\nThe Federal Agency The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets air quality\nstandards for particulate matter (PM). The EPA defines the maximum amount of\nairborne particles that can be present in outdoor air before those particles\nthreaten the public's health. EPA regulates two size groups or classes of\nparticles - particles up to and including 10 microns across (PM10) and particles\nup to and including 2.5 microns across in size (PM2.5). Each of these groups is\nmeasured in microns or micrometers (a micron is one-millionth of a meter). Plant\nand animal cells range in size from 10 microns to 100 microns. PM10 and PM2.5\nare each expressed as the amount, based on weight (in micrograms) of particles\ncontained in a cubic meter of air, micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g\/m3). PM2.5\nparticles are smaller than PM10 and are considered a subset of PM10. For further\ninformation see the EPA website for basic information:\n\n\nPM 10 balance.\n\nParticulate matter (PM) is a mix of the two classes of particles\nwith the PM2.5 more common for most US cities. This mix varies by day and time\nof day. These particles vary in shape, size and chemical composition, and can be\nmade up of many different materials such as metals, soot, soil and dust.\nParticulate Matter is most often from the burning of fuels, such as gasoline\nfrom cars, oil, diesel, or wood. In New Mexico we also include oil and gas\nrefining. Wind-blown dust, which is common in the spring in New Mexico, also\ncontributes to PM10 pollution.\n\nVisibility is monitored\n\n.\n\nVisibility in New Mexico can range from zero to more than 100\nmiles.\n\nThe EPA states:\n\n\"Particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter (PM10) pose a health concern\nbecause they can be inhaled into and accumulate in the respiratory system.\nParticles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) are referred to as\n\"fine\" particles and are believed to pose the greatest health risks. Because of\ntheir small size (approximately 1\/30th the average width of a human hair), fine\nparticles can lodge deeply into the lungs.\"\n\nExposed PM2.5 filters are returned and conditioned in the\nweighing room.\n\nFilters are conditioned prior to being weighed. The conditioning\nshelves contain the clean conditioning filters (filters to be weighed and sent\nout to be sampled), as well as the exposed (returned PM2.5 filters). Both are\nconditioned to the room environment for a period of time prior to being weighed.\n\nPM2.5 can become deeply embedded in the lungs. The lung is not\nreadily able to remove PM2.5 from the lung tissue; rather, those particles work\ndeeper into the lungs. At times of high PM concentrations scientists have noted\nincreased hospital, emergency room, and doctor's office activity for respiratory\nillnesses or heart disease. Also of note is the worsening of both asthma\nsymptoms and acute and chronic bronchitis. Scientists have found a relationship\nbetween high PM levels and reductions in various aspects of the healthy\nfunctioning of people's lungs.\n\nThe EPA further states,\n\n\"Health studies have shown a significant association between exposure to fine\nparticles and premature death. Other important effects include aggravation of\nrespiratory and cardiovascular disease (as indicated by increased hospital\nadmissions, emergency room visits, absences from school or work, and restricted\nactivity days), lung disease, decreased lung function, asthma attacks, and\ncertain cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and irregular heartbeat.\nIndividuals particularly sensitive to fine particle exposure include older\nadults, people with heart and lung disease, and children.\"\n\nThe elderly, children and those people with heart and\/or lung diseases are\nparticularly at risk to the harmful effects from high levels of PM exposure.\nChildren are affected due to their size and development. Infants and children\nare affected from inhaling PM pollutants because they inhale more air per pound\nof body weight than do adults - they breathe faster, spend more time outdoors\nand have smaller body sizes. Infants, due to their immature immune systems may\nbe more susceptible to PM than healthy adults.\n\nThe Mission of the Scientific Laboratory Division is to provide analytical laboratory\nsupport services\nand scientific advisement services for tax-supported agencies and groups or entities administering health and environmental programs for New Mexico citizens."}

Three techniques are under investigation: (1) using radon sample data as a surrogate for determining VOC vapor intrusion; (2) using building pressure differential to assess the potential for vapor intrusion; and (3) using sorbent-based methods for longer time-integrated measurement (1 to weeks) of indoor air VOCs.\n\nThe project team has completed the first two phases of the project at a former military housing complex at NAS Moffett Field Superfund Site in California. They are currently evaluating the data in preparation for a third phase, which will begin in late 2009. The third phase will focus on the most promising practical techniques for assessing vapor intrusion into commercial buildings. The EPA team anticipates project completion in 2010 with release of a Final Investigation Report presenting their findings and conclusions."}

The new study in Environmental Science & Technology shows that the airborne particles, made from natural molecules mostly given off by live or burning plants, last longer with a touch of pollutant packed inside. The pollutants are known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, and are regulated by environmental agencies due to their toxicity.\n\n\"What we've learned through fundamental studies on model systems in the lab has very important implications for long-range transport of pollutants in the real world,\" said physical chemist Alla Zelenyuk of the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. \"In this study, we propose a new explanation for how PAHs get transported so far, by demonstrating that airborne particles become a protective vessel for PAH transport.\"\n\nFloating in the air and invisible to the eye, airborne particles known as secondary organic aerosols live and die.

Tests showed a reduction in nitrogen oxides at street level of about 60 percent, according to Italcementi."}
{"text":"Inside Cover Story\n\nPune: a contradictory picture\n\n0 Comments\n\nIssue Date: Nov 15, 1997\n\nAshes to air: smoke belches fr Pune has enjoyed the reputation of being one of the cleanest cities in the country with regard to air quality. The number of premature deaths in Pune is estimated to have decreased from 991 in 1991-92 to 454 in 1995. Similarly, illnesses due to air pollution have decreased from 5,65,372 to 2,59,181 during the given period. Annual average level of spm in 1991-92 in the city was 196.6 g\/cum. In 1995, it dropped to 129.5 g\/cum. From these figures, it would appear that lower levels of spm as reported by the cpcb would have resulted in improvement of the status of public health in Pune. dte was eager to find out why levels of spm could have decreased in Pune over this period.\n\nThe city is surrounded on three sides by the Sahyadri mountain range. The eastern side is open. This geological formation has put some natural constraints on air circulation across the city. Small-scale industrial units have been mushrooming on the three hilly sides within a radius of about 20 km. The resultant smoke, dense particles, hot air and solid waste contradict the \"clean city\" image of Pune.\n\nThere are no large industrial units such as refineries or thermal power stations in Pune. But it is known as the auto capital of the country with two of the biggest automobile companies, the Tata Electrical and Locomotives Company (telco, the largest manufacturers of trucks in the country) and Bajaj Scooters (India's largest manufacturers of two-wheelers), based in the city. Ironically, the auto factories are not causing environmental problems in the city. The main pollutant in the city is auto emissions from petrol-driven scooters that have two-stroke engines. On an average, 250-300 vehicles are registered with the regional transport office every day. At present, about 550,000 of the 800,000 vehicles on Pune's roads are two-wheelers. In 1993-94, about 80,000 two-wheelers were sold in the state of Maharashtra, 58,000 of these in Pune.\n\nRecently, the municipal and state authorities have raised the floor space index for residential and commercial constructions in Pune. This has resulted in increase of high rise buildings. The combination of narrow lanes, tall buildings and a large number of scooters (which in some cases have to be parked on the second floor) has increased the levels of spm to dangerous levels. The acceptable level of SPM is 500 g\/cum. It has reached levels of 800-1000 g\/cum. The worst victims in Pune are the traffic police personnel. A survey conducted in June 1996 revealed that 80 to 85 per cent of traffic police personnel suffer from various ailments, diseases and disorders connected with high levels of spm . There is a marked rise in respiratory problems, sinusitis, lung infections, eye and skin irritation, insomnia, stress and diabetes. Municipal records for the number of people suffering from tuberculosis has risen from 617 in 1992 to 850 in 1996. Clearly, despite the lack of polluting industries and thermal power plants, Pune may be witnessing an increase in spm levels. The lion's share of the blame goes to two-stroke engines that make up for more than 67 per cent of the total vehicle population. Small-scale industries also stand to blame.\n\nSlow murder continues Air quality in Indian cities is deteriorating at a shocking rate. While major cities such as Delhi and Calcutta face severe air pollution problems, the emergent picture is none too good in smaller cities. Even as cpcb data indicate an improvement in air quality in cities such as Pune, Bhopal and Agra, dte reporters found no evidence to support this. In fact they found that air pollution due to spm emissions may even be on the rise. The inferences drawn by the dte reporters are based on general opinions and the data obtained during their field visits is limited.\n\nThere are two reasons why the air quality data reported by the cpcb for Pune, Bhopal and Agra does not match with the assessment made by dte reporters. Firstly, the data on ambient air quality does not reflect emissions from vehicles and is therefore not indicative of the deteriorating trend perceived by dte reporters. Secondly, it is possible that even though auto emissions are on the rise in cities like Pune, Agra and Bhopal, meteorological factors -- such as wind velocity -- affect the spm levels. While cpcb monitoring takes account of these physical factors, dte reporters could not include them in their assessment during the field visits. Nevertheless, it is clear that hardly any effective measures have been taken to curb pollution over the past few years.\n\nThe number of vehicles, especially diesel vehicles, are rising at a frightening rate. The situation in Delhi, Calcutta and Bhopal proves this beyond doubt. The concept of puc certificates is a farcical exercise in most cities visited. There is no reason not to assume that the puc certificate is in any way effectual in combating pollution. Even if emissions are within permissible levels, the alarming rise in the number of vehicles would prevent the pollution load from coming down. In places such as Agra, closure of thermal power plants is leading to rising numbers of diesel generators. Lawyer M C Mehta may have earned a name and awards for himself following his petitions in the sc but these have largely failed in controlling the levels of pollution in Agra. In Delhi, government officials are either blissfully unaware of the number of polluting industrial units or plainly incompetent in dealing with them despite the directives of the sc . Though esp s have been installed in thermal power plants in the city, nothing can be said about their effectiveness.\n\nAn important question mark is on the effectiveness of following Western models in developing countries such as India to estimate the health effects due to pollution. In order to get a clear picture of problems in India, there should be a model that takes all the local parameters into consideration. Given the complete lack of epidemiological studies in India, there is no doubt that models from developed countries provide some insight into the health impacts of environmental degradation. But it is crucially important to have reliable local estimates of health damages due to air pollution as they provide means of evaluating the results of pollution control measures.\n\nThe wb study by Carter Brandon claims that its estimates are conservative as many factors such as standard of living, nutrition and health -- that are generally poor in India -- have not been considered in their model. So it underestimates the number of premature deaths and sicknesses. A previous story by Anil Agarwal in dte (Vol 5, No 10) had analysed several unaccounted environmental costs in the wb study. The need for developing a model more suitable to India has never been greater. Air pollution in India needs to be taken very seriously at all levels."}

{"text":"Air Quality\n\nAir Quality is probably the most difficult environmental issue we face today in North Central Texas. The DFW region meets the standard for five of six criteria air pollutants defined by the EPA. The six pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxides (a precursor to ozone), ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide (leads to acid rain). Ozone is the only air pollutant for which we do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. The City of Dallas, along with many others cities across the United States and around the world, recognize the impact that smog and ozone formation have on our health and economic well-being.\n\nThe gas called ozone can be good or bad-depending on where you find it. The good variety occurs naturally at the upper reaches of Earth's atmosphere, where it protects us from ultraviolet rays and moderates our climate. The bad ozone accumulates within a few hundred feet of the ground when pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, industrial boilers, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react chemically in the presence of sunlight. Ozone pollution is most threatening during the summer months, when weather conditions necessary to form ground-level ozone-incessant sun and hot temperatures-normally occur. Unfortunately, with its hot summers and concentrations of traffic and industry, Dallas is an ideal incubator for the creation of ground-level ozone.\n\nQuite naturally, then, the City's efforts to improve air quality focus on these dangerous low-level accumulations of ozone as well as climate change. The Dallas\/Ft. Worth region has experienced a steady decline in ozone levels measured across the area. Emission reductions have been achieved from stationary sources (stack) emissions, cleaner cars and construction equipment, and cleaner fuels. The City has been a leader in emission reductions since the early 1990's."}

{"text":"Coal mining in NSW\n\nThere is growing community concern about the impacts on health and amenity associated with particulate matter (PM) emissions from coal mining in NSW.\n\nThe Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has undertaken a range of initiatives and actions in relation to the management of PM emissions from coal mines.\n\nInter-agency coal mine compliance audit\n\nThe EPA has maintained a strong regulatory focus on coal mines through a compliance audit program.\n\nIn late August 2010, it commenced a joint compliance audit program on managing PM emissions from coal mines in partnership with the Department of Planning and Infrastructure and Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services.\n\nThe objective of the program was to assess the level of compliance with the requirements to manage fugitive PM emissions contained in statutory instruments issued by each of the three agencies and to encourage improved environmental performance with reference to best management practice.\n\nA total of nine coal mines were audited (seven in the Hunter Valley and one each in the Gunnedah and Western coal fields).\n\nWhile every effort was made to accurately describe existing practices to minimise PM emissions using information provided by individual coal mines through various surveys, site visits and publicly available documents, some of the industry information provided may contain inaccuracies.\n\nDust Stop\n\nOne of the key recommendations of the Katestone report is that each mine should carry out a site-specific determination of best management practice.\n\nThe Dust Stop program aims to ensure that the most reasonable and feasible particulate control options are implemented by each coal mine. Under this program, all coal mines in NSW have six months to prepare a report that compares their current operation with international best practice. Mines are also required to report on the practicability of implementing each best practice measure. For any measures found to be practicable, each mine is required to provide a timetable for implementation.\n\nThe Dust Stop program is being implemented through pollution-reduction programs attached to each coal mine licence. Copies of each coal mine licence are available on the public register. The pollution-reduction program refers to a guideline that specifies the details that are required in each report.\n\nPollution reduction programs were issued to the first group of mines in August 2011. The first group of mines was selected to represent a cross-section of mine types in various locations throughout NSW.\n\nOnce complete, copies of each report will be available on the mine's website.\n\nThe EPA, in consultation with the mining industry and Department of Planning and Infrastructure, has developed an Interim Dust Assessment Handbook to assist mine operators in the Hunter Valley and to improve air quality for communities.\n\nThe Interim Handbook is designed for use by:\n\nmining equipment operators, supervisors and superintendents; and\n\nenvironmental regulators.\n\nThe handbook is a visual tool, containing a series of photographs that identify when to consider operational changes to minimise or reduce dust. It also assists in identifying whether mining activities are being conducted in a proper and efficient manner. In addition, the Handbook lists a series of factors to consider in assessing whether operational changes are required.\n\nThe Interim Handbook applies to vehicles on haul roads and to drilling rigs. It may be updated to cover other mining activities in the future.\n\nThe Interim Handbook is a 'glove-box' sized document made of durable materials to withstand day to day use in the mining environment.\n\nCopies of this publication can be purchased from the NSW Government Online Bookshop at  or by calling the EPA's Environment Line on 131 555.\n\nUpper Hunter air quality monitoring network\n\nIn response to community concerns about the cumulative health effects of particle emissions from coal mining and power generation on regional communities in the Upper Hunter, the NSW Government committed to providing a reliable ambient regional air quality monitoring network in this region.\n\nThe new network was launched by the Minister for the Environment on 9 December 2010.\n\nReview of Upper Hunter air quality monitoring data\n\nTo assist NSW Health review community concerns that air pollutants from coal mining and power generation in the Upper Hunter are impacting on health, OEH prepared a compendium which presents air quality monitoring data from industry monitoring sites for the period 2005-09.\n\nOEH report on the chemical and ecotoxicology assessment of the discharge waters from West Cliff Mine\n\nTo help validate the information previously provided by BHP under recent pollution reduction programs and to inform future strategies to manage the discharge of waters from the BHP-owned West Cliff Colliery mine site into Brennans Creek, the EPA conducted independent water sample testing along Brennans Creek and the Georges River.\n\nSampling of mine water discharged from West Cliff mine to Brennans Creek and the Georges River was undertaken at four sites over a 6-week period between May and June 2012. These samples were then chemically analysed and ecotoxicologically tested by the Office of Environment and Heritage.\n\nThe following OEH report, Chemical and Ecotoxicology Assessment of the Discharge Waters from West Cliff Mine, was completed for the EPA on Friday 31 August 2012. The report recommends further independent chemical modelling be undertaken on the current data to better interpret the ecotoxic effects and assist in setting appropriate discharge limits.

Soot pollution is the deadliest of the common air pollutants, causing thousands of premature deaths every year across the country through a variety of cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. It also contributes to haze that hangs over many of the country's most scenic parks and wilderness areas. Sources of soot pollution include power plants and diesel trucks and buses. The strengthened standards, to be issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, better reflect the latest scientific research.

{"text":"Pollution, people started complaining about coal dust and soot in the air over London, England. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the late 18 th century, humanity has been modifying the Earth's atmosphere and its chemistry. As industry spread across the globe, so did air pollution. Air pollution has many effects. In addition to being ugly, it can cause illness and even death, as well as damaging buildings, crops, and wildlife. Perhaps the worst air pollution recorded happened when dense smog (the combination of smoke and fog) formed over London on December 4, 1952 and lasted until March of 1953. Within six days over 4,000 people died, and 8,000 more died within six months.\n\nAir pollution is a broad term that is applied to particulate matter and chemical compounds that are released by humans into the atmosphere and modify its composition. It was first perceived as a local problem in urban industrialized areas, so factories and power plants started building taller smoke-stacks. However, taller stacks merely transported the problem elsewhere and soon regional problems such as acid rain were recognized. In Scandanavia, for example, the acidification of lakes was found to be the result of sulfur dioxide emissions from tall stacks located in central European countries such as Germany and even in places as far off as Great Britain. More recently, global problems such as climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion have been widely publicized.\n\nNatural sources that affect atmospheric chemistry include sulfur and nitrogen compounds from volcanoes and biological decay and particulate matter from dust storms and volcanoes. Plants, trees, and even grasses release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as methane, into the air. Of more concern, since we have the ability to control them, are anthropogenic, or man-made, air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, some fraction of VOCs, and nitrogen oxides. The largest source of anthropogenic pollution is the burning of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and gas, in our homes, factories, and vehicles.\n\nAir pollutants are classified as either primary or secondary. A primary pollutant is one that is released directly to the air, such as the carbon monoxide from combustion. A secondary pollutant is formed in the atmosphere through chemical reactions of primary pollutants. The formation of tropospheric ozone is an example of secondary air pollution.\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nAcid rain is a general term used to describe different kinds of acidic air pollution.

DuWayne Schmidt Chest Clinic at Intermountain Medical Center. Regardless of a person's medical history, poor air quality in Utah is \"definitely a concern,\" she said.\n\nIt may be obvious that patients with diagnosed asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other illnesses that affect proper breathing are impacted by bad air quality. But Blagev said researchers are discovering links to cardiovascular issues and increased risk of heart attacks as tiny particulates from polluted air enter the bloodstream and circulate through the body.\n\nBlagev and Sara Russell, a pulmonary nurse coordinator at the clinic, will participate in the Deseret News\/Intermountain Healthcare Health Hotline on Saturday, where they will answer questions from the public regarding respiratory and pulmonary health. Anyone interested in speaking with the duo can call 1-800-925-8177 between the hours of 10 a.m. and noon, or post a question on the Deseret News Facebook page.\n\nThe doctor said people with diagnosed breathing difficulties need to limit their exposure to bad air, but also mitigate episodes with prescribed medications and often rescue inhalers. Air filtering systems can help keep the bad air outside of the home and even those who aren't asthmatic should avoid exercising outdoors during a period of inversion.\n\nAvoiding air pollution altogether yields the greatest results, but is not feasible for everyone.\n\n\"Ultimately, pollution is what we emit and what we emit hangs over us and doesn't clear,\" Blagev said. \"Trying to cut our emissions, while we all say it's important, is not something that is easy to do.\"\n\nNot a lot of information is available regarding how pollution affects heart and lung function, but Blagev said studies are ongoing as more people seem to be affected. She blogs about air quality and other issues at mybetterdoctor.com.\n\nFine particle air pollution, she said, enters the bloodstream and somehow affects platelets, which are responsible for clotting the blood. It then contributes to inflammation and increased clotting, leading to unexpected effects in a person's heart, including more frequent stroke or heart attack occurrences during a period of inversion.\n\nRegular face masks don't filter the tiny matter from the air, Blagev said, adding that patients need to be vigilant about treating their own conditions and avoiding bad air as much as possible. \"Those individuals who are already diagnosed need to make sure they have a clear plan set forth with their doctor on what they can do when an inversion happens and what kinds of medications they can use to manage their condition,\" she said.\n\nTypical symptoms of asthma, which can be exacerbated by pollution, are chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, a scratchy throat and\/or a dry, persistent cough. Many people, Blagev said, aren't aware that they might have asthma, instead of a lingering cold or flu virus.\n\nPeople can contract asthma as lungs develop during childhood, or as they age, in the mid-50s. Many of the symptoms are falsely attributed to getting older or being out of shape but are, in fact, related to asthma, Blagev said.\n\nShe said people who live in areas where pollution is present can develop asthma over time.\n\nSaturday: A closer look at various respiratory illnesses\n\nHotline Saturday\n\nThe Deseret News\/Intermountain Healthcare Hotline focuses on respiratory and pulmonary health.

The report, published in the March 12 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, also found that that tiny components of smog called \"fine particulate matter\" had a clear link to cardiovascular deaths. That suggests that we have to deal with both pollutants.\n\nThe greatest risk may for those living be in hot, dry cities such as Los Angeles, which has one of the highest concentrations of ozone. Residents of Los Angeles may face a 25% to 30% higher annual risk of dying from a respiratory ailment versus people in low-ozone areas such as the Great Plains.\n\nOne in three Americans lives in an area that exceeds the national standard for ozone levels, but many scientists advocate still lower levels. An estimated 240,000 people in the United States and 7.7 million people worldwide die of respiratory disease each year.\n\nWhen hovering seven miles above the earth, ozone is beneficial because it blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun. However, closer to the ground it infiltrates the lungs and may cause damage. Ozone is also a powerful greenhouse gas.\n\nJJS: Perhaps less serious than human health, but still a problem, is how artificial our surroundings have become, even the sky above -- tho' somewhere there's progress.\n\nSkies Dimming Due To Pollution Everywhere Except Europe\n\nFor most of the world, increases in airborne pollution have been diluting sunlight over the past 30 years. Known as global dimming, researchers report in the journal Science that dimming is occurring everywhere except Europe, where declines in pollution have resulted in brighter skies.\n\nA suggested high-atmosphere \"sunshade\" of particles to battle global warming could reduce energy production from centralized solar power plants. Flat photovoltaic and hot water panels, commonly seen on household roofs, use both diffuse and direct sunlight, so they would be less affected.\n\nJJS: Now for some good news. The people who're supposed to be defending our rights are doing a bit more of that.\n\nU.S., Canada Seek to Control Air Emissions from Ships\n\nOcean-going vessels, primarily foreign owned and operated, dock at more than 100 U.S. ports, more than 40 of which are in metropolitan areas that fail to meet federal air quality standards.\n\nThe United States and Canada have moved to protect North American residents from harmful ship emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulate matter emissions by becoming the first two countries to ask the International Maritime Organization to create an emissions control area (ECA) around their coastlines extending out 200 miles (300 kilometers).\n\nThe U.S. and Canada typically see over 93,000 vessel calls at their ports annually. In addition, many more vessels operate in the proposed ECA that do not call on U.S. or Canadian ports, but instead are en route to Mexico or South America.\n\nThe two countries have a combined population in excess of 330 million, over half of whom reside along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Because ship pollution travels great distances, much of the inland population also will benefit from the cleaner air made possible by fuel and engine controls.\n\nThe creation of an ECA would save up to 8,300 American and Canadian lives every year by 2020 and avoid some 3.4 million instances of respiratory ailments, such as asthma.\n\nAdoption of this ECA would also help reduce the stresses on sensitive ecosystems, including numerous forests, grasslands, alpine areas, wetlands, rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters.\n\nMeeting ECA standards would increase operating costs for a ship between Singapore, Seattle, and Los Angeles\/Long Beach -- about 1,700 nautical miles of operation in the proposed ECA -- by about three percent.\n\nBeatrice Olivastri, chief executive of Friends of the Earth Canada, said \"Ships are currently burning fuel 1,800 times dirtier than diesel trucks and the emission control area would achieve a sulfur reduction to 0.1% -- still 66 times dirtier than ultra low diesel.\" This is a starting point -- not an end point.\n\nThe IMO, a United Nations agency, will begin reviewing the proposal in July. A joint application will be received more favorably at the International Maritime Organization. A decision could be issued next year.\n\nJJS: While this is progress, some more fundamental steps to take address the bottom line by adopting geonomics. That, to clear the air it makes sense to quit subsidizing polluters -- here, shippers and to quit taxing labor and capital, so cleaner ways can be found and implemented. At the same time, recover and share the rental value of resources (like Alaska's oil dividend), so that on one hand old entrenched grey ways won't be as desirable to investors and on the other everyone will have a stronger identity with and a stake in the health of the earth."}

{"text":"14 An Evaluation of Atmospheric Aerosols in Kanana, Klerksdorp Gold Mining Town, North-West Province of South Africa Brighton Kaonga and Eno E. Ebenso North-West University (Mafikeng Campus), South Africa 1. Introduction Atmospheric aerosols have posed a health challenge by their presence in the atmosphere. In order to control them, they have to be understood in terms of their interactions in the air, their length of suspension and their transportation. It is true to say aerosols have been in the atmosphere since the beginning of time itself. As long as there has been wind, particulate matter has found itself in the air, attributed to nature aerosol emissions. Atmospheric aerosols technically are considered to be suspension of fine solid or liquid particles in a gas (Hinds, 1999). Particles in the air can change their size and composition by condensation of vapour species or evaporation, coagulating with other particles by chemical reaction, or by activation in the presence of water. The production of atmospheric aerosols or atmospheric particulate matter is of great concern. The effects of inhaling particulate matter which have been widely studied in humans and animals include asthma, lung cancer, cardiovascular issues, and premature death (Pope & Burnett, 2002). The size of the particle is a main determinant of where in the respiratory tract the particle will come to rest when inhaled. Larger particles are generally filtered in the nose and throat and do not necessarily cause problems, but particulate matter smaller than about 10 micrometers (\u00b5m), referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. The 10 micrometer (\u00b5m) particle size does not represent a strict boundary between respirable and non-respirable particles, but has been agreed upon for monitoring of airborne particulate matter by most regulatory agencies (Seinfeld & Pandis, 2006). Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers, PM2.5, tend to penetrate into the gas-exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (< 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. PM2.5 leads to high plaque deposits in arteries, causing vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis \u2014 a hardening of the arteries that reduces elasticity, which can lead to heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems (Pope & Burnett, 2002). Airborne particles undergo various physical and chemical interactions and transformation (i.e. atmospheric aging), changes of particle size, structure, and composition (coagulation, restructuring, gas uptake, chemical reaction). Particularly efficient particle aging occurs in clouds, which are formed by condensation of water vapour on pre-existing aerosol particles (cloud condensation and ice nuclei). Most clouds re-evaporate, and modified aerosol\n\nPage 2\n\nAir Quality Monitoring, Assessment and Management 286 particles are again released from the evaporating cloud droplets or ice crystals (cloud processing). If, however, the cloud particles form precipitation which reaches the Earth's surface, not only the condensation nuclei but also other aerosol particles are scavenged on the way to the surface and removed from the atmosphere. This process, termed \"wet deposition\", is actually the main sink of atmospheric aerosol particles. Particle deposition without precipitation of hydrometeors (airborne water particles)\u2014that is, \"dry deposition\" by convective transport, diffusion, and adhesion to the Earth's surface\u2014is less important on a global scale, but is highly relevant with respect to local air quality, health effects (inhalation and deposition in the human respiratory tract), and the soiling of buildings and cultural monuments (P\u00f6schl, 2005). Depending on aerosol properties and meteorological conditions, the characteristic residence times (life-times) of aerosol particles in the atmosphere range from hours to weeks. Emission of particulate matter by natural means did not present as much health hazards as compared to man-made activities. Natural emissions sources were wind dust, sea sprays and natural fires or biomass burning. But this changed when man began to develop himself; trying to make himself comfortable. The more he became comfortable the more population increased, prompting new developments that consequently led to activities that are now responsible for health threatening atmospheric aerosols. These activities included the improved transportation system, industrial transformation, and consumption of fuel etc. This pattern can be seen in the study area of interest, Kanana in South Africa. 2. Purpose of the research study area Literature shows that air pollution continues to threaten public health despite tighter emission standards, closer monitoring of air pollution, and reduction of levels of certain types of air pollutants. Averaged over the globe, anthropogenic aerosols (those made by human activities) currently account for about 10 percent of the total amount of aerosols in our atmosphere, (Pope and Burnett, 2002). The increased levels of fine chemical particle concentration and composition in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease, altered lung function and lung cancer. It is for this reason that an evaluation of the air quality with regard to particulate matter was undertaken in Kanana area in the Klerksdorp gold mining town of the North-West province of South Africa. 2.1 The case of Kanana, Klerksdorp (South Africa) The North West Province, with its favourable geographical location close to the provincial capital of South Africa, as well as its eco-tourism potential and the mining industry, is one of South Africa's most visited provinces. Touristic attractions include: \u2022 The Sun City\/Pilanesberg complex, Magaliesberg, and Hartbeespoort. Recommended new nodes include: Borakalalo Game Reserve, Vredefort Dome, Vaalkop Dam, and Ganyesa \/Kalahari. \u2022 Both foreign and local tourists visit the North-West Province. As such international tourist bring in foreign exchange and so contribute greatly to the economy of the country. Map of Kanana and description is shown below. Kanana lies in what is called Orkney gold mining area, within Klerksdorp as can be seen in the map above (26\u00b0 58' 0\" South, 26\u00b0 38' 0\" East).\n\n2.2 Environmental strains of the North-West Province According to the State of the Environment Report overview (2002), North West Province, South Africa is under pressure especially from: \u2022 The Ga-Rankuwa, Brits, Hartebeespoort and Rustenburg area due to industrial mining and other developments. This area is also one of the tourism nodes in the Province that needs to be sustained. \u2022 The main corridors for tourism are: Hartebeespoort-Rustenburg-Sun City-Madikwe Game Reserve; Hartebeespoort-Rustenburg-Zeerust-Mafikeng-Lehurutshe, Gauteng-Potchefstroom-Klerksdorp-Wolmaransstad-Bloemhof. The State of the Air Report in South Africa (2005), list polluting sources as industrial and commercial activities; electricity generation especially coal-fired and fuel-turbine power stations; waste treatment and disposal that includes incineration; residential activities that includes burning of coal, paraffin, liquid petroleum (LP) gas, dung and wood; transport (petrol-diesel driven exhaust emissions, road dust raised by vehicles, etc); and agriculture. On the other hand, there are admissions of health-risking particulate matter emissions into the environment by industrial giants like the mines such that the public raised complaints because of poor visibility and too much dust from the smelters and refineries, as well as dust fallout from various tailings dams (Bullock, 2006). and 3. Information on sources of particulate matter emissions Like any other settled areas of the world, Rustenburg, another mining city in the North West Province, has had its effects of human development on the quality of air. Before the onset of industrialization, the air in the town was influenced by the natural phenomenon occurrences; particulate matter in the atmosphere as a result of wind dust, fire-raised atmospheric aerosols and particulate matter emissions as a result of human activities. But the advent of increased population, pressures on the atmosphere also increased as a result of increased human needs. The functioning and quality of the environment got affected as the result of increased human needs. Increased population meant increase in land use such as settlements, agriculture, and industry, to mention but a few.\n\nPage 4\n\nAir Quality Monitoring, Assessment and Management 288 Industrial development in the form of mining appears to have had more influence in the settlement in Rustenburg and the surrounding towns like Klerksdorp. 3.1 Mining According to the North-West Freight Transport Databank, Rustenburg town alone contributes about 70% platinum mining of the world. Chrome is also mined extensively. Klerksdorp is mostly a gold mining town. South Africa as a whole is the largest producer of gold in the world. The gold mining sector provides about 56% of miner's employment in the country. Mining activities produce toxic metals like mercury (Roulet et al., 1999) and so it is important to establish the contribution of particulate matter in the atmosphere.\n\nA\n\nB Fig. 1.

Haulage track with particulate matter emissions Source: State of Air Report in South Africa (2005) 3.3 Human sector Mining sector offered great employment opportunities. This attracted people from even surrounding areas thereby putting pressure on municipalities in terms of housing. As a result all forms of settlements mushroomed \u2013 both planned and unplanned.

{"text":"Native landscaping practices can help improve air quality on a local regional and global level. Locally, smog (ground level ozone) and air toxics can be drastically reduced by the virtual elimination of the need for lawn maintenance equipment (lawn mowers, weed edgers, leaf blowers, etc.) which is fueled by gasoline, electricity or batteries. All of these fuel types are associated with the emissions of the following air pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and air toxics such as benzene. Gasoline lawn and garden equipment, on average, produces 5% of ozone-forming VOCs in areas with smog problems. This equipment also emits toxics and particulates.\n\nRegionally, the NOx and SO2 released from lawn maintenance equipment react with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain.\n\nGlobally, native landscaping practices help to combat global warming in two ways. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major greenhouse gas and by reducing the use of lawn maintenance equipment, the associated CO2emissions are also reduced. Native plants help to reduce the amount of CO2in the atmosphere by taking in CO2and storing the carbon in the body of the plants, roots and soil. Native plants work much better than traditional mowed grass as a carbon sink due to their extensive root systems and increased ability to retain and store water.\n\nExercising outdoors? It's that time of year again! Check your local air quality forecast to help plan the best time for a workout or run. Knowing your local air quality can help avoid aggravating respiratory problems. &ldquoeople 2007Today's environmental tip: Be green from the ground up! Test your home for radon. Radon is a naturally occuring, odorless gas that can seep out of the ground into your home. But as the second leading cause of lung cancer, radon is responsible for over 20,000 deaths a year. Fortunately, a home radon test is easy to do, and homes with high radon levels can be fixed.\n\nToday's environmental tip: Get the lead out! If you're doing work on an older home or school building, be sure to follow lead-safe work practices. Contain the work area and keep kids and pets away. Minimize dust. And clean up thoroughly. Lead is harmful to adults and children, and common renovation jobs like sanding, cutting, or demolition can create lead dust and chips\n\nToday's environmental tip: Everyone can make a difference! High school students can study links between everyday actions at their high school, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change. Become a \"climate ambassador\" leader in your school or neighborhood and motivate friends, schools, and community leaders. Talk to you friends - help spread the word!T\n\nToday's environmental tip: Wait for the storm to pass! Don't fertilize before a rain storm. Your fertilizer - along with your money - can just wash off your lawn and down the storm drain. Fertilizer runoff can pollute rivers, lakes, and bays, and cause problems in recreational areas or fishing grounds. Check the weather forecast before you head out, and wait for the storm to pass.\n\nTransportation consumes about 25 percent of the total energy used in the United States. Driving releases harmful chemicals and other air pollutants into the air. When, where, how, why and what you drive all play an important role in affecting air pollution. Here are some suggestions on how to be more environmentally friendly when you need to get somewhere.\n\nDrive less, especially during peak traffic periods or hot days.\n\nUse public transportation, walk, or ride a bike.\n\nShop by phone, mail or Internet.\n\nTelecommute. Even one day a week will make a big difference.\n\nCombine your errands into one trip.\n\nCarpool. Sharing rides reduces emissions.\n\nAvoid revving or idling engine over 30 seconds.\n\nAvoid waiting in long drive-thru lines, for example, at fast-food restaurants or banks. Park your car and go in.\n\nAccelerate gradually, maintain speed limit and use cruise control on the highway.\n\nFind out if materials are recycled when you change your tires, \"throw away\" your car or change car fluids. Ask before your car is serviced and consider going to someone who is environmentally friendly.\n\nToday's environmental tip: During hot weather, don't top off your gas tank. Refuel your car or truck in the early morning or the evening when it's cooler. A small fuel spill may not seem like much, but every spill evaporates and adds to air pollution, and fuel pumps with vapor recovery systems can feed a spill back into their tanks - after you paid for it. So, in hot weather - don't top off!\n\nToday's environmental tip: Don't trash it - reuse it! Be creative as you look for new ways to reduce the amount or kinds of household waste. Give cardboard tubes to pet hamsters or gerbils. Plant seeds in an egg carton. Make a flower pot out of a plastic ice cream tub. By thinking creatively, you will often find new uses for common items and new ways to recycle and reduce waste"}

Nitrogen dioxide is in fact irritating to the mucous membranes, and can contribute to various alterations of lung functioning, chronic bronchitis, asthma and pulmonary emphysema. Long-term exposure even to low concentrations drastically decreases the lungs' defences, increasing the risk of respiratory infections.\n\nThe effects of nitrogen dioxide appear hours after exposure, so that people do not normally realise that their problems are due to the polluting air they have been breathing.\n\nPARTICULATE MATTER\n\nThe term \"particulate matter\" refers to all particulates suspended in the air with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 thousandths of a millimetre.\nThe principal sources of PM10 are in human activity: combustion processes (including those in internal combustion engines, heating systems, numerous industrial activities, incinerators and thermoelectric power plants), wear on tyres, brakes and asphalt. A large part of the PM10 in the atmosphere is the product of transformation of certain gases into liquid or solid particles (nitrogen and sulphur compounds) emitted by human activities.\nPrecisely because of their small size, these pollutants can penetrate the respiratory system beyond the larynx. Pathologies caused by pollution from particulates includeasthma, cardio-pulmonary infections and compromised lung functioning.\n\nVOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCs)\n\nThe term Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) refers to a series of substances in liquid or vaporous form with a boiling point ranging between a minimum of 50-100\u00b0C and a maximum of 240-260\u00b0C. The term \"volatile\" indicates the capacity of these chemical substances to evaporate easily at ambient temperature. More than 300 compounds fall in this category.\n\nUrban VOCs are produced almost exclusively by combustion in motor vehicles, coal-fired power plants, incineration and evaporation of solvents and fuels.\nVOCs are also generated by use of cleaning products, paints, pesticides, glues and adhesives, printers and photocopiers, tobacco smoke, etc.\n\nThe photocatalysis process triggered by TiO2 in ACTIVE Clean Air & Antibacterial Ceramic\u2122 tiles breaks down the pollutants and toxic substances listed above and transforms them into innocuous compounds such as nitrates, sulphates and carbonates.\nThe final result is a significant reduction in toxic pollutants (under standard ISO 22197-1) produced by automobiles, factories, home heating systems and other sources.\nThe result is an improvement in the environment and the quality of the air we breathe, offering clear benefits for human health."}

{"text":"A recent analysis of existing studies on the link between tiny soot particles and premature death due to cardiovascular problems has revealed that mortality rates are twice as high as previously believed. Health Effects Institute, a nonprofit organization created by the EPA to provide unbiased studies of the health effects of air pollution, released its findings on June 4th. Birmingham and Atlanta were among the cities included in the study. According to the new evaluation, the risk of having a condition that is a precursor to heart attacks goes up by 24% as opposed to 12% as particle concentrations increase. These particles, which have a diameter of less than a 30th of a human hair, are produced by diesel engines, automobile tires, coal-fired power plants, and oil refineries, among other things.\n\nThe link between these particles and cardiopulmonary disease has been known for twenty years. The EPA began regulating their emissions in 1997 but declined to lower chronic exposure limits in 2006 despite evidence that the particles were deadlier than once believed. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found that decision to be inadequate. The Obama Administration is now considering what levels are appropriate.

{"text":"by Veronica Smith, Public Relations Intern, Hamilton County Department of Environmental Services\nWhen the warmer weather approaches, it brings many of nature's beauties to the forefront. From flowers to radiant thunderstorms, we experience some of the most precious occurrences our planet has to offer. However with this beauty also comes damaging UV rays, smog and allergies. In anticipation of these events, the Hamilton County Department of Environmental Services (HCDOES) launched its annual Smog Season program on April 1. The program, which runs through October 31, monitors the level of ground-level ozone and Particulate Matter (PM) in the four-county region.\n\nGround-level ozone is a pollutant which chemically reacts with sunlight to produce smog, a serious condition which poses serious health risks and threatens local air quality. Particulate Matter is dust, soot, ash and other solids and aerosols which come from a variety of sources. PM can penetrate into sensitive regions of the respiratory tract and even transfer into the bloodstream. Smaller particles can cause persistent cough, phlegm, wheezing and physical discomfort. In conjunction with other area environmental experts, HCDOES uses the ground-level ozone and PM data it collects through monitoring, along with temperature data and weather conditions provided by meteorologists, to determine when to issue Smog Alerts.\n\nThese Smog Alerts help residents in Butler, Clermont, Hamilton and Warren Counties and Boone, Kenton, Campbell Counties in Northern Kentucky protect themselves against the health risks associated with smog, and reminds them to reduce their impact on ground-level ozone and PM levels.\n\nBy keeping tuned into the news and weather reports and staying aware of the Smog Alert warnings this season, you can protect yourself and others against the many health risks associated with ground-level ozone and PM. These risks include the potential to alter the body's defense systems against foreign materials, damage lung tissues, aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and can even lead to cancer and premature death. Some of the health risks associated with smog include:\n\nAn increased risk of death from heart disease\u2014as much as 18% with prolonged exposure to PM.\n\nTo help combat ground-level ozone and PM and reduce the number of Smog Alert days, residents should take measures to reduce the level of air pollution, one of the main contributors to smog. The following tips can help you cut back on air pollution and reduce the amount of Smog Alerts issued this season:\n\nTurn off the car\u2014avoid drive thru lines and driving situations that require idling.\n\nConserve energy\u2014turn off lights and computers.\n\nRefuel after sunset\n\nDon't top-off at the pump.\n\nTighten your gas cap.\n\nAvoid using gas-powered lawn equipment.\n\nRideshare, combine trips and eliminate unnecessary trips.\n\nWalk to your destination or ride a bike. This is a great way to exercise and save money!\n\nAvoid driving during your lunch break.\n\nBy doing your share to reduce air pollution and staying aware of the air quality monitoring information offered by HCDOES, you can make 2010's Smog Season a safer and healthier one.

This Group will comprise three existing areas of expertise drawn from across the College: the Lung Biology Group, the ERG-Air Group (the UK's largest operator of regional air monitoring networks), and the Environmental Science Research Group.\n\nDespite the wealth of information regarding the impact of air pollution on lung function, less is known about the underlying mechanism of tissue injury. It is also unclear why some people are particularly susceptible to the effects of air pollution. The new Group will investigate the effects of air pollution on health, specifically:\n\u00b7 Why 10%-15% of the population are particularly sensitive to air pollution and is the basis of this sensitivity genetic or nutritional. \u00b7 Why ultra-fine particles in the air are particularly toxic. \u00b7 Whether particles from different locations are equally toxic, or whether there are there some areas where particles are more dangerous. \u00b7 How susceptible people can be helped to deal with air pollution.\n\nProfessor Frank J Kelly, an expert in the health impact of air pollution and current head of the Lung Biology Group, has been appointed to the Chair and will take up his new post in September 2001. Commenting on his appointment Professor Kelly said:\n\n\"The creation of this Chair offers an exciting opportunity to help forward our understanding of the health consequences of air pollution. Air pollution is largely invisible and therefore often ignored, yet its impact on public health is real, particularly for vulnerable sections of society such as infants and older people.\"\nNotes to Editors\nProfessor Frank J Kelly\nProfessor Kelly leads the Lung Biology Research Group at King's where he combines his two main research interests: free radical biochemistry and diseases of the lung. He has published widely in these areas, including over 140 publications in peer-reviewed journals. Professor Kelly is Chairman of the British Association for Lung Research and President-elect of the European Society for Free Radical Research.\n\nLung Biology Group\nThis Group's main area of research focuses on injuries to the lung caused by air pollution, and in particular how these differ in people with diseases such as asthma.\n\nERG-Air Group\nERG-Air is the UK's largest operator of regional air monitoring networks, collecting over 1 million data points every day. The Group uses the data to monitor current air quality in a given area and predict future levels of air pollution.\n\nEnvironmental Science Research Group\nLed by Dr Steven Smith in King's renowned School of Health and Life Sciences, this Group has internationally recognised expertise in the chemical characterisation of particles in the air"}
{"text":"EPA Rule Would Reduce Interstate Pollution\n\nWhen soot and other pollution blows away from power plants, the emissions can cause problems for nearby states that are trying to clean up their air.\nToday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a regulation that would make\nit easier for downwind states to met air-quality standards.\n\n\"This EPA proposal is a big step in the right direction,\" said Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch in a statement, who called for deeper reductions.\n\"There is no question we will need further pollution cuts from power plants to meet updated national clean air standards for smog and soot.\"\n\nThe so-called transport rule would impact 31 eastern states and the District of Columbia. By 2014, the rule would reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen\noxides\u2014which contribute to smog\u2014by 71% and 52% compared with 2005 levels. The agency estimates that these reductions would result in up to 36,000\nfewer premature deaths and $120 billion of health benefits annually, such as preventing acute bronchitis and asthma attacks. The annual cost of\ncompliance, such as upgrading power plants, would be $2.8 billion.\n\nThe transport rule replaces a 2005 Bush Administration proposal, called the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR).\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit told EPA to revise CAIR, by specifying which states were contributing pollution to other\nstates, for example. Concerned that CAIR would allow power plants to buy pollution credits from other states, the court also wanted EPA to ensure that\neach state would end up with cleaner air.\n\nIn a press conference call today, Gina McCarthy, EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, said that agency scientists had done computer\nmodeling of how pollution moves between states. In its proposed new rule, the agency allocates a pollution \"budget\" to each state and would allow\ntrading of pollution credits between power plants within states. Limited trading would be allowed between states, with penalties if the state exceeds\nits pollution budget.\n\nSome observers are wary. \"I'm very cautious about any interstate trading in this rule,\" says Paul Miller, deputy director of the nonprofit group\nNortheast States for Coordinated Air Use Management in Boston. He would like to see a solid scientific explanation that trading would improve air\nquality in downwind states."}
{"text":"Declining air pollution levels continue to improve life expectancy in US is the largest study to date to find beneficial effects to public health of continuing to reduce air pollution levels in the U.S.\n\nThe study appears in the December 3, 2012 online edition of the journal Epidemiology.\n\n\"Despite the fact that the U.S. population as a whole is exposed to much lower levels of air pollution than 30 years ago\u2014because of great strides made to reduce people's exposure\u2014it appears that further reductions in air pollution levels would continue to benefit public health,\" said lead author Andrew Correia, a PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at HSPH.\n\nThe study looked at the effects on health of fine particulate matter, small particles of 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter\u2014referred to as PM2.5. Numerous studies have shown associations between acute and chronic exposure to fine particle air pollution and cardiopulmonary disease and mortality. Studies have also shown that reductions in air pollution are associated with reductions in adverse health effects and improved life expectancy. Air pollution has been declining steadily in the U.S. since 1980, but the rate has slowed in the years since 2000. The HSPH researchers wanted to know whether the relatively smaller decreases in PM2.5 levels since 2000 are still improving life expectancy.\n\nControlling for socioeconomic status, smoking prevalence, and demographic characteristics, the results showed that a decrease of 10 micrograms per cubic meter (10 \u03bcg\/m3 ) in the concentration of PM2.5 during the period 2000 to 2007 was associated with an average increase in life expectancy of 0.35 years in 545 U.S. counties.\n\nThe research expanded on a 2009 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by some of the same authors (Pope, Ezzati, and Dockery) that found that reduced air pollution was associated with increased life expectancy in 211 urban counties. This new study looked at more recent data, more than two-and-a-half times as many counties, and included both rural and urban areas. The findings showed that there's a stronger association between declining air pollution and increased life expectancy in more urban, densely populated areas than in rural areas. The results also suggested that reduced levels of air pollution may be more beneficial to women than to men.\n\nAs to why there was a stronger association between reductions in fine particulate matter and improvements in life expectancy in urban areas, the researchers speculated that the composition of the particulates there may be different from that in rural areas.\n\n\"Since the 1970s, enactment of increasingly stringent air quality controls has led to improvements in ambient air quality in the United States at costs that the U.S. Environ\u00acmental Protection Agency has estimated as high as $25 billion per year. However, the extent to which more recent regulatory actions have benefited public health remains in question. This study provides strong and compelling evidence that continuing to reduce ambient levels of PM2.5 prolongs life,\" said senior author Francesca Dominici, professor of biostatistics at HSPH.\n\nMore information: \"The Effect of Air Pollution Control on Life Expectancy in the United States: An Analysis of 545 US Counties for the Period 2000 to 2007,\" Andrew W.

The story is fictional but its lessons are not. For all those who watched the 2012 Lorax film, you'll remember that the citizens of Thneedville would have fresh air delivered to their homes because the air had been so badly polluted. Never would I have imagined that clean air is becoming an expensive commodity in our world today.\n\nI'm sure you are thinking where is air being delivered? Recently I heard a story on NPR about the booming business of air filters in China. Yes, China is the Thneedville of our nonfictional world. Manufacturing and more importantly a lack of concern for the environment have damaged the air quality in parts of the country.\n\nOf course, we are not China or Thneedville and we do have some regulations, specifically the Clean Air Act (CAA). This 1970 federal law regulates air emissions from multiple sources.

{"text":"Degradation of Global Environment Affects Human Health To A Large Extent\n\nDegradation of Global Environment Affects Human Health To A Large Extent:\n\nIntroduction - The problems resulting from environmental change and its degradation, pose new challenges for traditional public health science. It is an accepted fact that, environmental degradation is contributing to human health threats worldwide. We may have several questions in our mind.\n\na. How much does the environment affect human health?\n\nb. Are air pollution and tainted water shortening our lives and those of our children?\n\nThese questions have aroused increasing interest in recent years. In the poorest regions of the world an estimated one in five children will not live to see their fifth birthday, primarily because of environment-related diseases. This tragedy translates into more than 11 million childhood deaths a year worldwide, mostly due to malaria, acute respiratory infections or diarrhea, all illnesses that are largely preventable.\n\n* Why environmental health? Environmental degradation is an important factor contributing to the burden of disease. 19%\u201325% of the burden of disease in developing world is linked to environmental factors. The annual cost of damage to health and quality of life due to environmental degradation; is estimated to be 1.8%\u20133.4% of gross domestic product in some countries. 43% of the children's (0-14 years) mortality is attributable to poor environmental conditions.\n\n* Thus, environmental degradation exerts significant pressure on human health. Exposure to air, water and soil pollution, to chemicals in the environment, or to noise, can cause cancer, respiratory, cardiovascular and communicable diseases, as well as poisoning and neuro-psychiatric disorders.\n\n* Air pollution, in fact, is one obvious environmental health threat in many countries, contributing to a number of illnesses, such as asthma and in some cases leading to premature death. Of particular concern is the fact that children are more vulnerable to air pollution than adults, and increased rates of infant mortality have been recorded in highly polluted areas. Concerns about the impact of air pollution on health and the economy have resulted in measures to mitigate emissions of the most harmful pollutants, such as particle pollution (acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles) and ozone, which affects the respiratory system. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are not likely to decrease in the years ahead, unless appropriate action is taken.\n\n* Fossil fuels give us more than just climate change. Burning fossil fuels contributes to other air pollution problems like acid rain and smog that also damage forests, lakes and agricultural crops. The biggest impact from these pollutants, however, may be on human health. Emissions from burning energy include tiny particles that we breathe deep into our lungs. Once there, these pollutants cause respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis, and cardiac problems. If these particles carry toxics like benzene, furans or dioxins, they can eventually cause cancer.\n\n* Water is another key environmental health issue \u2013 unsafe drinking water and untreated waste water kill thousands of people a year, most of them children. Other health issues associated with emerging environmental hazards, such as chemical products, will also need to be addressed. Chemical products are used in virtually every man-made product and play an important role in the everyday life of people around the world. However, harmful exposure to chemical products can lead to health problems such as skin diseases, chronic bronchitis, nervous system dysfunctions and cancers as well as damaging the environment.\n\n* Deforestation, agricultural uses of land, climate change caused by increased carbon dioxide emissions, and pollution have lead to create unsafe and unhygienic conditions that increase disease spread. Deforestation forces changes in watershed and local climate.\n\n* Environmental degradation has shown an increasing relationship with the rise and spread of human diseases. Genes evolved and became more susceptible to disease to the environmental impacts. The World Health Organization believes that almost one third of global disease can be directly related to environmental risk factors. Antibodies and immune systems have developed in part as a result of environmental change. In fact, environmental change plays a large role in the emergence of infectious disease. In particular, as the human population continues to grow, the population density increases; this leads to an abundance of parasites and infection-forming conditions. Extreme temperatures, climate-related disturbances, and air and water pollution have a direct influence on the spread of infection and disease. Environmental exposures to chemicals and toxins are a major contributor to disease.\n\n* Many of the environmental conditions that impact health are avoidable. Therefore, prevention of health problems through environmental management, rather than simply treating diseases and ailments after they have occurred, is the salient message of environment and health section of various UN charter and various NGOs. These messages offer governments, development agencies, policy-making groups, private businesses, communities and individuals worldwide strategies to slow or even halt further environmental deterioration, averting significant ecological disruption and its possible accompanying economic impacts.\n\n* Improvements must be made in environmental protection. Education is a key process in bettering the conditions. Monitoring of climatic changes help to anticipate outbreaks, as well as changing habits, such as drainage of swamps, screening of houses, and improvements in sanitation and nutrition. Improvement of air quality, water supplies and sanitation, education of the medical community and general public, support of vaccination research, and coordinated restrictions of the use of antibiotics and pesticides would lead to mitigate the problems.\n\n* Focused investments in education, healthy work conditions, environmental sanitation, and a safe water supply are extremely effective in improving health and well being, as well as in increasing productivity and economic growth. Strengthening dialogue between the environment and health sectors at national and local levels required to enhance the quality of health system.\n\nConclusion - We all are affected by environmental degradation, but it is the poor \u2013 especially women and children \u2013 who bear the main burden.\n\nThe health effects of global change are often indirect and difficult to assess, and quality of evidence for the health-related outcomes varies widely. Furthermore, the health science necessary to understand global environmental change is increasingly interdisciplinary and requires collaboration among meteorologists, chemists, biologists, agronomists and health scientists.\n\nEnvironmental degradation exaggerates the imbalance between population and resources, and worsens the severity of poverty. In other words, interaction between poverty, population growth and environmental degradation impede sustainable economic development and worsen population health. It is important for health scientists to anticipate the potential consequence of environmental change and act accordingly. It is irony that, serious environmental problem are often unknown or unrecognized. For example, at the time of first major international conference on environment in Stockholm (1972) global warming, acid rain and tropical deforestation were not recognized as major potential problems and no work for prevention of environmental degradation carried out early.\n\nResponses\n\nThis is a very good source of educating the world to be more cautious in her interaction with the environmemt in which we live and thrive. By so doing we would create a sustainable environment for the future."}

Air quality can vary within a county.\n\nComparisons of air quality data to health measures are done at an aggregate level, and just because events occur in the same geographic area does not mean one must cause the other for each individual person. Elevated rates certain health effects in areas of potentially higher ozone exposure do not necessarily mean the ozone is causing that health outcome. There may be different factors contributing to the health of different individuals.\n\nLimitations of the data\n\nIt is not representative of overall air quality.\nBecause the data are only a small snapshot of air quality characteristics in an area and do not take into account all factors that contribute to overall air quality the data only represent what may be possible given the data that has been collected.\n\nWhen there is more than one air monitor with a county the highest reading on any day is used.\nSo, estimates for larger areas with more than one air monitor may be biased higher than estimates for smaller areas with only one air monitor.\n\nThese data do not give us any information about air quality in counties where there are not air monitors.\nAir monitors tend to be located in urban areas, where the most people live, and air quality is often worse than in rural areas.\n\nAbout these measurements\n\nThis indicator is comprised of two measures: the number of days above the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), and the number of person-days above the NAAQS. The NAAQS for ozone is 0.080 parts per million (ppm) for data prior to 2008 and 0.075 ppm for data collected in 2008 and beyond. These measures are provided only for counties where air quality monitors are maintained and measurements are taken. Not all counties have monitors or have air quality measurements taken. Data is available for the years 2001 \u2013 2008. Data may not be available for each monitor each year.\n\nThe data are obtained only from monitors that are designated as Federal Reference Methods or equivalent. The data include values associated with exceptional events such as high winds, fires, or construction.\n\nCalculation methods\n\nFor all of these calculations, EPA's DataMart is used to access daily maximum 8-hour average ozone concentrations and supplemental data (such as latitude, longitude and elevation) for all the monitoring sites across the United States. These calculations only include data from monitors that meet the minimum data completeness criteria set by EPA's national air quality standards.\n\nCalculating number of days above National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)\n\nThis measure is of the 8-hour average of hourly measurements taken. A day is considered to be above the NAAQS for ozone if the maximum 8-hour average for a 24 hour period exceeds the NAAQS. The NAAQS for ozone is 0.08 ppm for an 8-hour average for samples prior to 2008. The NAAQS for ozone from 2008 to present is 0.075 ppm for an 8-hour average.\n\nCalculating person-days above National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)\nPerson-days above NAAQS is calculated by multiplying the number of days that monitored levels are above the NAAQS in a given county by the population of that county.\n\nMetadata\n\nWhat is air quality?\n\nAir quality tells us how much pollution is in the air.\nAir we breathe is often contaminated by a variety of gaseous chemicals and tiny\nsolid and liquid particles that either shouldn't be there at all, or are present\nat higher concentrations than they should be. We generally call this air pollution.\nThe fewer pollutants there are in the air, the better the air quality.\n\nWhy is air quality a\nconcern?\n\nThe average adult breathes about 3,400 gallons of air each day.\n\nAir pollution also damages the environment. Acid rain and ground level ozone can\nharm trees, crops, streams, lakes, and animals as well as buildings, monuments and\nstatues.\n\nPollutants can easily move from one area to another as the wind blows, so air quality\nconcerns everyone.\n\nWhat is already known\nabout air quality and human health?\n\nAir quality affects human health in a variety of ways. It can:\n\nIrritate the eyes, nose and throat\n\nCause coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath\n\nIncrease the severity of lung conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema\n\nIncrease the risk of heart attacks and strokes\n\nContribute to low birth weight\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nAnyone can suffer health problems due to air pollution, but the most vulnerable groups\nare:\n\nChildren\n\nOlder adults\n\nPeople who already have lung or heart disease\n\nThe health effects of air pollution depend on how much pollution a person is exposed\nto. This is determined by:\n\nThe amount of pollution in the air\n\nHow much air a person breathes in (for example, a runner breathes in more air than\nsomeone walking)\n\nAir pollution tends to be a more severe problem in cities, but high levels of air\npollution can be found anywhere.\n\nUse less electricity. Power plants can produce a lot of pollution, so using less\nenergy helps reduce air pollution.\n\nRecycle. It conserves energy and helps reduce air pollution.\n\nHow is air quality tracked?\n\nAir monitoring stations around the state measure the levels of different pollutants.\nCurrently, Colorado is reporting real-time measurements of carbon monoxide, nitrogen\noxides, sulfur dioxide, ground level ozone and particulate matter (PM), both PM10\n(particles 10 micrometers and smaller) and PM2.5 (particles 2.5 micrometers\nand smaller).\n\nThe two air pollutants that cause the most problems in Colorado are ground level\nozone and PM2.5.\nThose are the measures of air quality that are currently included in the Tracking\nnetwork.\n\nGround level ozone\nis the major component in what we usually call smog. It is measured continuously\nby air monitoring stations.\n\nParticulate\nmatter 2.5 (called PM2.5) includes very small particles of dust, dirt, smoke,\nsoot and even tiny drops of liquid. It is called PM2.5 because these particles are\nbetween 0.01 and 2.5 micrometers in size. The small size of these particles allows\nthem to get deep into the lungs, which is a health hazard. Air monitors measure\nPM2.5 hourly in some areas, and either daily or once every third day in other areas.\n\nUrban areas tend to have higher levels of air pollution due to more traffic, power\nplants and factories.\nBecause of this, many of the air pollution monitors in Colorado are located along\nthe Front Range corridor from Colorado Springs to Fort Collins, the most densely\npopulated area of the state.\nData from remote monitoring sites is automatically uploaded to the Air Pollution Control Division website every hour, 365 days\nper year. You can view this data in near real-time to help you make decisions about\nhow to reduce your risk of health problems due to air pollution.\n\nWhere are Colorado's\nair monitoring sites and how do they work?\n\nSite locations:\nPM2.5 sites are, as of November 2010, located in all the major Front\nRange cities from Pueblo to Fort Collins and in Greeley, Cortez, Elbert, Grand Junction,\nPlatteville, and Rifle. There are 19 sites monitoring PM2.5. Of these, eight locations\ncollect only filter samples, two locations collect only continuous hourly data,\nand nine locations collect both filter sample data and continuous hourly data. Ozone\nsites are, as of November 2010, located all along the Front Range and in Cortez,\nGrand Junction, and Rifle. There are 21 monitoring locations for ozone. All of these\nsites are continuous monitors.\n\nMeasurement at filter sites:\nClean filters are equilibrated at a known temperature and humidity, precisely weighed\nby a microbalance in a laboratory clean-room, shipped to the sites under \"chain of custody\", and sampled for 24 hours\nfrom midnight to midnight. The filters are collected and sent back to the lab, with\nassociated data, for equilibration and post-weighing analyses. The pre-weight is\nsubtracted from the post-weight to get a net weight. Sampler data, including the\nvolume of air that flowed through the filter for 24 hours, is matched to the lab\ndata using a unique filter ID to get a concentration of the particles in the air.\nThe mass of particles per volume of air is calculated to get micrograms per cubic\nmeter (ug\/m3).\n\nMeasurement at continuous monitoring sites:\nContinuous air monitors use a variety of methods to measure levels of different\npollutants in the air. They produce measurements every hour of every day. These\nmeasurements are sent by computer to the CDPHE Air Pollution Control Division. You\ncan view this data\nto help you make decisions to reduce your risk of health problems due to air pollution."}
{"text":"during summer months - Fashion\n\nduring summer months\n\nSubmitted by lcyweiwei on Sat, 04\/21\/2012 - 17:49\n\nWhen it's blazing hot during summer months, does it seem to you like the quality of air you're breathing is not very good? Well, that's because it's true. During extreme summer heat, the sun simmers the air and all of the Air Cleaner it contains. This helps create a smog effect making the air uncomfortable for healthy persons and difficult and dangerous for those already experiencing breathing difficulties. Regions with high smog levels show increased hospital and emergency room visitsor respiratory problems.The non-profit organization Clean Air Watch recently reported that a record heat wave in July 2006 caused a blanket of smog reaching from coast to coast. More than 30 states reported more unhealthy air quality days in July2006 than in July 2005. 2005 is the hottest year on record. Public health ozone standards were exceeded more than 1,000 times in July 2006.Often during a heat wave,Air Cleaner, electricity is either scarce or unavailable.This causes many people to use generators to create electricity, which further exacerbates the problem. Diesel generators produce more pollution per watt of power output than power plants do. They produce upto 20 times as much particulate pollution as modern, natural gas fired power plants.One of the biggest concerns involving heat and air pollution is ozone. Ozone is associated with increased asthma attacks, Air purifier, wheezing, and complications of other respiratory illnesses. Ozone is a colorless to pale blue gas and one of the most toxic inorganic compounds known."}
{"text":"New Air Standards\n\nThe recommended standard will be updated from 0.12 parts per million of ozone measured over one hour to 0.08 parts per million measured over 8 hours.\n\nThe new standard will extend new health protections to 35 million people, bringing to 113 million the number of Americans protected by the air quality standard for ozone.\n\nFor children, the new standard will reduce respiratory problems, such as asthma attacks. It will result in 1 million fewer incidences of decreased lung function in children each year.\n\nStates and counties will have at least until the year 2004 to meet the new standard.\n\nParticulates\n\nThe standard for coarse particles remains essentially unchanged, while a new standard for fine particles-less than 2.5 microns, or about 1\/28th the thickness of a human hair-will be set at an annual limit of 15 micrograms per cubic meter, with a 24-h our limit of 65 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nThis is the first time the government has set a public health standard for fine particle pollution.\n\nScientists say that fine particles are some of the most damaging to human health because they penetrate and remain in the deepest passages of the lungs.\n\nThe new standard will provide new protections to nearly 70 million Americans, and will prevent approximately 15,000 premature deaths a year.\n\nThe EPA will allow five years to build a nationwide monitoring network to gather and analyze the data needed to designate nonattainment areas and gather information needed to write plans to control particulates.\n\nThe EPA will allow another three years for areas that are not in compliance with the standard to develop plans, and several more years to actually comply with the standard.\n\n- Source: EPA"}
{"text":"Carbon monoxide alarms FAQ\n\nWhat is carbon monoxide?\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a poisonous gas that kills approximately 500 people in the United States alone every year. Consumer products like a stove or water heater that emit CO kill about 200 people of that number. You cannot hear, taste, see or smell carbon monoxide, giving it the nickname the \"silent killer,\" because it sneaks up on its victims and can take lives without warning.\n\nWhat are the sources of CO?\n\nCO is a byproduct of incomplete combustion. CO sources can include malfunctioning appliances such as furnaces, stoves, ovens and water heaters that operate by burning fossil fuels such as natural or liquefied petroleum (LP). When malfunctioning appliances are not adequately ventilated, the amount of CO in the air may rise to a level that can cause illness or even death.\n\nAdditional sources of CO include vehicle exhaust, blocked chimney flues, fuel-burning cooking appliances used for heating purposes, and charcoal grills used in a home, tent, camper, garage or other unventilated areas.\n\nHow does CO affect the human body?\n\nWhen victims inhale CO, the toxic gas enters the bloodstream and replaces the oxygen molecules found on the critical blood component hemoglobin, depriving the heart and brain of the oxygen necessary to function.\n\nThe following symptoms are related to carbon monoxide poisoning and should be discussed with all members of the household:\n\nIn many cases of reported CO poisoning, victims are aware they are not well, but they become so disoriented that they are unable to save themselves by either exiting the building or calling for assistance. Young children and household pets are typically the first affected.\n\nCO alarms are intended to trigger at carbon monoxide levels below those that cause a loss of ability to react to the danger of CO exposures.\n\nHow can I tell if there is a risk of CO poisoning in my home?\n\nHave your fuel-burning appliances inspected by a qualified technician at least once a year. A qualified technician should have practical knowledge of the operation, installation and proper ventilation of fossil-fuel-burning devices; carry the applicable insurance; be bonded; and be licensed to perform heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) work in your area.\n\nBe alert to these danger signs that indicate a potential CO problem:\n\nStreaks of carbon or soot around the service door of your fuel-burning appliances\n\nThe absence of a draft in your chimney (indicating blockage)\n\nExcessive rusting on flue pipes or appliance jackets\n\nMoisture collecting on windows and walls of furnace rooms\n\nFallen soot from the fireplace\n\nSmall amounts of water leaking from the base of the chimney, vent or flue pipe\n\nDamaged or discolored bricks atop the chimney\n\nRust on the portion of the vent pipe visible from outside your home\n\nAlso, recognize that CO poisoning may be the cause when family members suffer from flu-like symptoms that do not disappear but improve when they leave home for extended periods of time.\n\nHow can I avoid CO poisoning?\n\nThe most important steps are preventive. Have a qualified service professional inspect your fuel-burning appliances at least once a year. Install UL Listed CO alarms outside of sleeping areas and near all fuel-burning appliances.\n\nOther precautions include:\n\nAvoid using charcoal grills inside a home, tent, camper, or in an unventilated garage.\n\nDo not allow vehicle exhaust fumes to enter the home.\n\nMake sure all fuel-burning appliances are properly ventilated.\n\nWhat should I look for when I buy a CO alarm?\n\nRather than looking for specific features, look for the UL Mark with the adjacent phrase \"Single Station Carbon Monoxide Alarm.\"\n\nUL Listed CO alarms are designed to detect elevated levels of CO and sound an alarm to alert you and your family of a potential poisoning risk. Although CO indicator cards and other devices on the market are also intended to detect elevated levels of CO, most are not designed with an audible alarm. The presence of an audible alarm is significant especially while you and your loved ones are asleep.\n\nUL Listed CO alarms are required to have a manually operated alarm reset\/silence button that will allow you to silence the alarm signal. If elevated levels of CO continue to exist, the alarm will sound again in six minutes.\n\nHow can I protect my family when we're traveling? When we are working in the garage?\n\nUL evaluates and Lists CO alarms intended for use in recreational vehicles (RVs) and areas such as garages or attics where dampness, humidity and temperatures aren't as controlled as in the living space of the home. CO alarms used in these areas comply with additional requirements designed to address the special conditions often present in these environments.\n\nUL also evaluates CO travel alarms. These devices are equipped with a mounting bracket for temporary mounting only.\n\nUL Listed CO alarms intended for use in these environments are marked accordingly near the UL Listing Mark.\n\nDo CO alarms operate differently than smoke alarms?\n\nAlthough they may look and sound similar, CO alarms and smoke alarms are designed and intended to detect two distinct hazards. Therefore, to help protect your family from both hazards, it is important to install both UL Listed CO alarms and UL Listed smoke detectors.\n\nHow do I install my CO alarm?\n\nFollow the installation instructions found in the manufacturer's use and care booklet that accompanies the product. Proper installation is an important factor in receiving optimal performance. It is important to follow these instructions step by step in their entirety.\n\nHow do I take care of my CO alarm?\n\nCO alarms need to be tested regularly and cleaned as indicated in the manufacturer's use and care booklet. If the unit operates off a battery, test the detector weekly and replace the battery at least once a year.\n\nShould I follow any safety tips for using and maintaining my CO alarm?\n\nRead the manufacturer's use and care booklet for installation and maintenance guidelines. Keep these instructions on file for future reference.\n\nIf your unit operates off a battery, do not remove it for any length of time unless to change it. Like any appliance or power tool, a CO alarm cannot work unless it has a functioning power source.\n\nWill exposure to other household gases or vapors cause the CO alarm to sound a false alarm?\n\nWhen UL evaluates samples of residential CO alarms, consideration is made that your home may contain moderate levels of cleaning chemicals and other substances. UL 2034, the Standard for Safety of Single and Multiple Station Carbon Monoxide Alarms, UL engineers and technicians use to test residential carbon monoxide alarms, includes exposure tests to normal concentrations of methane, butane, heptane, ethyl acetate (nail polish remover), isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), carbon dioxide and propane; all of these are gases typically found in a home.\n\nYou should, however, keep these chemicals away from your CO alarms. Low exposure over an extended period of time could damage the sensing device and cause it to sound a false alarm.\n\nWhat do I do if my CO alarm sounds?\n\nMove outside or open a window to allow fresh air to enter. Check to make sure that everyone in your household is present. Do not re-enter the premises nor move away from the open door or window until the emergency services have arrived, the premises have been sufficiently ventilated, and your CO alarm remains in its normal condition.\n\nIf your CO alarm reactivates within a 24-hour period, operate the reset button, call your emergency services and move to fresh air. Call a qualified technician to examine and\/or turn off your fuel-burning appliances or other sources of combustion. If your RV, car or truck is idling in an attached garage, turn off the engine. Although the problem may appear to be temporarily solved, it's crucial that the source of CO is determined and appropriate repairs are made.\n\nRemember that an alarm indicates elevated levels of CO in your home. CO is called the \"silent killer\" because it cannot be seen or smelled. Some people can be exposed to dangerous levels of CO and not feel any symptoms. Regardless of whether you feel symptoms, never ignore the sounding of a CO alarm"}
{"text":"The transport sector is the single largest contributor to urban ambient air pollution. Vehicles are estimated to contribute up to 70% of total urban air pollution (NSW EPA, 1999). Motor vehicle emissions are key sources of lead, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide They are also the major source of photochemical smog ('ozone') precursors. With the exception of particles, petrol passenger vehicles are the major transport source. Heavy diesel vehicles are also a significant source of nitrogen oxides (NOx). The diesel fleet is the major transport source of particles, contributing up to 80% of vehicle produced particles in major cities (NEPC, 1998).\n\nHigh levels of air pollutants have been shown to result in a wide range of adverse health effects including respiratory effects, ranging in severity from coughs, chest congestion, asthma, to chronic illness and possible premature death in susceptible people. Recent research indicates that unless further action is taken to improve the management of transport emissions, air quality is likely to decline in the medium to long term.\n\nThe transport sector is also one of the largest contributors to national greenhouse gas emissions. It contributed about 16% of national greenhouse gas emissions in 1998. Transport sector emissions rose by 18% during 1990-98. Road transport is the largest contributor to transport emissions and makes up 14% of total national emissions. The average rate of increase in road transport emissions over the period 1990 to 1998 was about 2% per annum. Passenger cars contributed 9% of national emissions, or 57% of total transport sector emissions in 1998.\n\nThe nature of the problem is such that an integrated strategy, coordinating action across a number of different areas, including vehicle emission standards and fuel quality, is required to address the issue.\n\nIn December 1999, the Commonwealth Government gazetted mandatory new vehicle emission standards as Australian Design Rules (ADRs) under the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. The gazettal of these new, tighter emission standards effectively requires vehicle manufacturers to adopt new vehicle and emission control technologies. However, existing Australian fuel quality is a constraint to the effective functioning of many of these new technologies. The relatively high sulfur content of both petrol and diesel in Australia has been identified as a particular problem for the effective operation of engine catalysts necessary to meet tighter emission standards.\n\nAs ADRs are nationally applicable it is necessary to ensure that fuel of the appropriate quality is widely available in Australia. The key fuel parameters required for the deployment of advanced vehicle technologies are fuel octane ratings and sulfur content.\n\nAlmost all the States and Territories currently have some form of fuel quality regulatory regime. In the past this was mainly limited to the lead content of petrol. Several jurisdictions however, amended their legislation in response to the announcement by the Commonwealth of proposed fuel changes under the Measures for a Better Environment (MBE) initiative. Further detail on State-specific standards is outlined in the RIS included in the Explanatory Memorandum for the Fuel Quality Standards Bill 2000, (p.14).\n\nAs pointed out in the RIS to the Fuel Standards Bill, State-specific legislation has the potential to result in different standards for each jurisdiction which could give rise to competition issues, by creating barriers for refiners and importers to interstate markets and raising compliance costs. There is evidence that this problem has already arisen with some companies having to pay premiums under the refinery exchange program where they cannot meet the State standards and need to source the fuel from the local refinery. Under the refinery exchange system, local refineries provide fuel for the State\/local area to other companies for supply. For example, fuel sold in NSW as BP or Mobil may have been produced at the Shell or Caltex refineries in Sydney.\n\nIn Western Australia where BP owns the local refinery which is producing fuel to state specific standards, other companies are charged a premium for the cleaner fuels. It has been claimed by oil companies (The Australian 6 March 2001) that State-specific legislation in South Australia has resulted in a 0.7c per litre premium for unleaded petrol and 0.32c a litre for diesel supplied by Mobil, the only refinery in the State that can produce the 'boutique' fuel resulting from the standards.\n\nIn order to achieve the environmental and human health benefits associated with new vehicle emission standards, complementary national fuel standards are required. Introduction of such standards by the Commonwealth Government will ensure a nationally consistent approach to the regulation of fuel quality in Australia.\n\nA national approach will also avoid the competition issues that are already arising for Australian refineries that cannot meet State-specific standards resulting in higher premiums under the refinery exchange program."}
{"text":"Pollen & Mold\n\nPollen\n\nPollen are small, round-shaped male cells of various flowering trees, grasses and weed plants. The average pollen particle is under 50 microns in size and is less than the width of an average human hair. Pollen can travel as far as 400 miles and up to two miles high in the air. Plants have pollination cycles which are consistent from year to year, though weather conditions can affect the amount of pollen in the air at any one time. Pollination season occurs earliest in the south and starts progressively later in more northern regions. Trees pollinate earliest, followed by grasses. Weeds pollinate last. Pollen vanish after the first hard frost. Source: AAAAI\n\nMold\n\nMolds are parasitic, microscopic fungi without stems, roots or leaves. As many as 250,000 spores can fit on one pin head. These small spores float in the air like pollen. They are found outdoors and indoors and their levels peak in the late summer and fall months. Outdoor molds commonly grow in moist, shady areas such as in soil, decaying vegetation, leaves and rotten wood. Cladosporium and Alternaria are common outdoor molds. Indoor molds are found in dark, warm, humid areas inside the home including basements, cellars, attics and bathrooms. Mucor, Aspergillus and Penicillium are common indoor molds. Source: AAAAI"}

{"text":"By all means, yes, air pollution is hurting us, although many people pay no attention to it. More and more people are beginning to help though, and you can, too. Here are some helpful ways you can stop polluting the air:\n\nThe most air pollution is happening in major cities in all parts of the world. Cities aren't the best place to live when it comes to air pollution because of smog. Smog is a type of air pollution which has affected human heath the most of all air pollution in ever recorded history. It is caused by water molecules coming together with smoke particles in the atmosphere to form a dense fog. The smoke particles are often from burning coal. London had a severe fog in 1952 in which 4,000 deaths occurred. This was of the type of smog shown above.\n\nICE SMOG\n\nAnother type of smog is ice smog. Ice smog is when smoke particles and ice crystals combine. Ice smog happens only in high places, like mountains, and at very low temperatures.\n\nACID RAIN\n\nSomething else that happens from air pollution is acid rain. People call it acid rain because there is some acid in it which can destroy buildings, waterways, and many crops. Acid rain is when pollution is carried in the atmosphere for a long period of time. Then comes down with rain.\nEverything we just talked about is from people polluting the air. If you don't want things like this happen as much as they are, think about ways you can stop them! You can help!"}
{"text":"Burning fossil fuels releases significant quantities of carbon dioxide, aggravating climate change. Although it gets less attention these days, combustion also emits volumes of pollutants, which can cause a variety of illnesses. The most extensive consequences across the U.S. are noted below.\n\n\u2014 Mark Fischetti\n\nU.S. Health Burden Caused by Particulate Pollution from Fossil-Fueled Power Plants\n\n18 Comments\n\nIt's a small percentage of combustion that becomes the particulates that contribute to many of the above problems, but those very small percentages certainly have a pronounced effect. Diseases such as asthma should be incredibly uncommon, yet are disturbingly commonplace these days. Of course, combustion waste isn't the only contributor; second-hand smoke, volatile chemicals, etc, all contribute.\n\nWest Virginia is #1 in all those ailments because we are the #1 fossil fuel burner and we are not going to let any of that \"clean energy\" stuff come into our state. We are proud of our dirty #1 reputation.\n\nAgain, no one can say dirty energy is cheap in light of these numbers. Stricter pollution controls and a price tag on carbon emissions are the most practical way to even begin to balance out these externalities. That way, the Market can make more efficient decisions instead of being thrown out of whack by these indirect subsidies.\n\nSault, I can say that dirty energy is way cheap in light of these figures; you don't seem to be aware of your surroundings. I urge you to look at the whole picture:\n\nI would happily stipulate to the statistics in the article if they would also print an article delineating the myriad ways in which lives are improved, indeed saved, through the use of fossil fuels.\n\nWhat, for instance, are the economic and medical benefits derived from the use fossil fuels? Well, there is the high percentage of life saving medicines derived from the chemical compounds found in fossil fuels. That fact alone overshadows by far the number of deaths and illnesses attributed to the evil Texas \"T\".\n\nBut wait! There's more! The internal combustion engine, which is derided so often here and elswhere, is directly responsible for life saving rides to the hospital that must number twenty five to fifty times the number of \"illnesses\" per year listed above.\n\nThen there is the hospital, which simply would not exist in it's present form without fossil fuels; there are no materials in a modern hospital, for instance, which aren't in some way tied to fossil fuels; from the plastics which are made directly from the chemicals found in oil, to every single product that had to be shipped there by some means of transportation, to the building materials themselves, which wouldn't exist without fossil fuels.\n\nSorry, I'll put up with my asthma as long as I can get my daughter and her ruptured appendix to surgery in a timely manner. Or would you suggest she use eco-friendly mass-transit?\n\nThe greatest lie the left ever told is that Humans are destroying the earth with fossil fuels. In fact, the exact opposite is true. We owe our robust health in this country largely as a result, directly or indirectly, to the use of fossil fuels.\n\nWe will undoubtably move eventually to some other form of energy some day soon and I look forward to that day. But this pathetic, myopic, one-sided article is hardly the persuasive argument you seem to think it is. But keep trying; Your love for all things left is pretty endearing.\n\nYou're confusing energy source with energy services. Now that we are able to generate power cleanly, we should not let these costs to society that fossil fuel usage imposes to be socalized anymore. Letting dirty energy get a free ride on their externalities retards clean energy deployment and makes the market operate less efficiently.\n\n\"You're confusing energy source with energy services. Now that we are able to generate power cleanly, we should not let these costs to society that fossil fuel usage imposes to be socalized anymore\".\n\nI'm not confusing anything. I merely understand that the two cannot be summarily separated in the way you suggest. Fossil fuels benefit our lives in SO MANY ways that most people, leftist environmentalists in particular, take it all for granted.\n\nSo, Okay, I'll bite; What then, is your clean energy source that can supplant gas and diesel and coal as the pre-eminent fuel for powering our national fleet? What is the fuel of YOUR choice for our shipping? Where is the cheap source of power to heat and cool our homes and businesses; ALL of our homes and businesses?\n\nWhen can we expect the complete revamping of our national infrastructure so that we can carry on with business as usual? And please, as an aside, don't try to say that the evil, greedy Republicans are what's standing between you and this utopia! I'm frankly sick to death of that tiny minded, one dimensional assessment of our political process.\n\nThese are not rhetorical questions, even though they are probably unanswerable by you. Unanswerable in any meaningful way that is. Because unless you possess some special knowledge of which I am unaware, I'm guessing all you have to offer are the usual suspects; solar, wind power, electric vehicles, biofuels, and fuel cell technologies.\n\nI'm sorry, but if each and every one the above were to be subsidized at 100% and put into practice, all of them COMBINED would not begin to meet the smallest fraction of total energy demands for decades to come. And this is to say nothing about building the kinds of support and infrastructure necessary to replace fossil fuels.\n\nThe collective left (I do know how to turn a phrase, don't I?) Bleats and yammers about \"dirty oil\" and \"evil, greedy rich people\" like so many two year olds, pounding on their high chairs in their full diapers: \"Oil BAD! Don't want oil! me want happy green alternative! Me want NOW\"!\n\nSorry to have to tell you this, but none of the nanny states on the planet, including, sadly, our own, can accomodate you right now. Why don't you all lie down with your blankies an go night night for while?\n\nYou make some good points timbo (although it might behove you to be a little less derisory). But we cannot ignore these deaths which are a real cost to the use of fossil fuels that are not \"accounted\" for when comparing costs.\n\nThere ARE alternatives to fossil fuels, albeit superficially more expensive, that can at least reduce the amount of coal and fuel we burn.\n\nAnd, of course, there is the real answer to our climate change and fossile fuel woes if only we would examine the data rationally - and that is Nuclear.\n\nUnfortunately the word \"fukushima\" shuts down all rational debate about nuclear as being part of the way forward\n\nI agree with you about nuclear It is overwhelmingly cleaner and safer than coal for instance. But it seems that the Luddites have the louder voices for the time being.\n\nMy main point being is that there is nothing that replaces fossil fuels for the foreseeable future. Nor do I care whether we exploit these technologies to the best of our ability, but it will still be nibbling around the edges of this historically beneficial symbiosis.\n\nAs to AGCC, We still have about thirty to fifty years before anyone will know to a certainty whether the models are right or whether it's natural variability. By that time vast new disruptive technologies will have arrived to make the argument mute, in my not so very humble opinion.\n\nAnd thanks but no thanks on your cordial invitation to be less derisory (great word!) As a christian and a conservative, I have been slandered and derided and labeled enough here. I give every bit as good as I get and more; and I don't believe in the \"measured response\".\n\n1. Include externalities like these health costs into the price of fossil fuels somehow. Tight pollution standards and a price on carbon between $20 - 40 per ton would be a good start. This would raise the energy costs for the median household by between $70 - $170 PER YEAR. Not a bad deal to begin cleaning up the air, right?\n\n2. Remove subsidies to dirty energy incumbent industries. The $4B per year Domestic MANUFACTURING tax credit the Oil Industry takes advantage of is the most egregious, but there are plenty of others. FYI, the Republicans bellyache about the Deficit and complain that renewable energy gets subsidies, but then they block its repeal. This is just a handout to the most profitable industry on Earth, so they don't need any bought-and-paid-for handouts anymore.\n\n3. Refund 80% of the Carbon Tax revenue to every valid Social Security # and use the remaining 20% to fund energy efficiency and clean energy research \/ deployment.\n\n4. Slowly ratchet up the price on carbon a few percent every year or more based on emissions levels to keep the world from backsliding.\n\n5. Lead the world in clean energy \/ efficiency again, exporting the clean infrastructure the world craves while putting people to work building it here too. Watch the money pile up.\n\n6. Build up electric car charging infrastructure and steadily improve EV \/ plug-in hybrid cost and range. The Nissan Leaf already gets 100 miles and costs $32K before the tax credit and battery improvements are so numerous that it's hard to keep track of them. Increase the tax credit to $10K and make it a point-of-sale rebate.\n\n7. Build high-speed rail connecting major corridors like DC - Boston, Minneapolis - NYC, San Diego - San Fran. Do the same for freight lines to get most of the big rigs off the highways (they cause 95% of road surface deterioration, so this could SAVE lots of money).\n\n8. Develop biofuels to run air transportation, marine shipping and the rest of the long-haul transport that can't be electrified.\n\n9. Stop subsidizing sprawl by changing the mortgage interest deduction and planning laws that spread cities out needlessly. Encourage high-density zoning so people have the freedom to live without a car if they want (I'm one of them and there are millions like me).\n\n10. Watch with delight as the wackos in the Middle East go bankrupt and have to hit each other with sticks on camelback againWith due respect timbo you are totally off the mark with respect to AGCC. We know now we are the cause - the evidence for that is overwhelming. There is uncertainty only about how far\/how fast the warming will be.\n\nIf you cannot see that then you are denial of the evidence which somewhat kills your credibility on this topic. I suggest you look at the skepticalscience.com website to learn more.\n\nThere is no denying that fossil fuel use has brought us many benefits - but there are also costs of which this article highlights but some - and until now we have ignored them. There will be an accounting for these costs whether we will it or not.\n\nWe cannot afford to wait 50 years. By then the damage will be undoable and it is wishful thinking, not evidence based logic, to assume that technology will provide a magic bullet solution. There are alternatives available now that we can start to implement. They don't provide 100% of the answer yet but we need to be doing what is achievable - and a first step is putting a price on CO2 emissions that reflects its true cost.\n\nThat is a true \"suer pays\" market pricinple and will also send the right price signal for us to start the move towards better alternatives theHigh speed rail, for even the densest population areas, is ridiculously expensive and even at full capacity will take LESS than five percent of the cars off the road.\n\nFor half the money you could duplicate the freeway you already have and thereby get more people to their destinations faster with fewer fatalities, if that's what you really care about.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of utopian, \"popular science\" Socialist planning that appeals to the left, because it \"sounds\" good, or \"feels\" good or both, but isn't rooted in reality.\n\nUnfortunately, it would require crippling subsidies. It would take three to five time as long to build, and it would serve just a tiny fraction of the taxpayers who pay for it.\n\nI'm sorry, but you just made the least populist suggestion I've heard fom a Socialist in a while; Spend the most amount of money to serve the least number of people. Building roads accomplishes exactly the opposite.\n\nEven if you could demonstrate those numbers regarding illness and mortality, etc. were accurate, you would have to compare them to something; I compare them to 300,000,000 people who lead happy, healthy, propsperous lives due to fossile fuels.\n\nPlease tell me why Europe can accomplish High-speed rail and we can't? It's that kind of defeatist attitude, the idea that America can't solve big problems anymore that has gotten us into so many problems over the last 30 years. People of your philosophical persuasion go on and on about the creative spirit and energy of the USA, but as soon as we want to do something that actually helps people, you guys become the biggest bunch of crybabies ever.\n\nGuess what, road construction NEVER pays for itself because the federal highway fund has to borrow from the general fund every year due to the absurdly low gasoline taxes in this country. As it stands currently, people who don't use a car like me are SUBSIDIZING people who do use a car, people like you I'm guessing, because my income taxes supplement infrastructure that I don't use. Now is that fair? How about we AT LEAST increase fuel taxes to fully cover the highway fund to eliminate those darn subsidies you always complain about"}

You're going to have to multiply it by a period of time and divide it by some mass to achieve the correct dimensions. Fortunately, we can make a few measurements and come up with these quantities.\n\nI'll start with the mass, since it's the hardest to compute. In 1 hr, you produce 1200 mg of Ozone. In order to find ppm, I need to know the mass of the air into which these 1200 mg of Ozone will be spread. This is where the measurements come in. Let's say the room is 4x5x2.5=50 m3. The mass of the air in the room will be it's Volume x Density = 50 m3 X 1.25 g\/l x 1000 l\/m3 x 1000 mg\/g = 62,500,000 mg.\n\nIf you divide the mass of the ozone by the mass of the air, you'll get the mass fraction of ozone.

{"text":"Pollen Alert!\n\nSep 19, 2008\n\nWhen you stroll through your front door in the morning, does the yellow haze coating the porch send you leaping back into the house? Can the mere word \"pollen\" make you start to sniffle, sneeze and reach for the tissue to blow your nose?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to these questions, you're probably one of millions of people in the United States suffering from hay fever. Pollen can do more, however, than just make you sneeze. If you have asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pneumonia, pollen can be downright dangerous. While most of the particles we inhale end up in shallow portions of our airways -- trouble enough! -- the tiniest shards can make their way dangerously deep into the lungs.\n\nSome studies suggest that these little fragments of misery have extreme inflammatory potential and can impair human respiratory and cardiovascular-related health. For example, a study in the Netherlands uncovered a strong association between day-to-day variations in pollen concentrations and deaths from cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia.\n\nA NASA team, with help from academia, industry and health agencies, is exploring this tantalizing link between pollen, in this case juniper pollen, and some of these dangerous health conditions.\n\n\"Our research could really help people with pollen-related health issues,\" says team lead Jeff Luvall, Earth scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention is one of NASA's partners in the study. Len Flowers, from CDC's Environmental Public Health Tracking Program at the New Mexico Department of Health in Albuquerque, New Mexico, says, \"We're exploring the relationship between two unprecedented recent juniper pollen peaks in northern New Mexico and the amount of sick leave taken by state employees at those times. We're also looking at the asthma emergency department visits and hospitalizations in our communities, and at other respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations.\"\n\nAnd what if they find the link they expect?\n\nThis is where NASA shines. Luvall's team has a solution ready -- and it comes from space. \"Tiny pollen grains are transported in the wind, and we're using NASA satellite data to help predict pollen movement,\" says Luvall.\n\nAccurate forecasts of pollen transport and dispersal could help reduce many of the maladies mentioned above by forewarning vulnerable people about pollen headed their way. In short, they'd know when to \"take cover.\"\n\n\"The overarching goal is to use satellite images of greening plants to predict pollen bursts before they happen so that preventive measures can be taken,\" says Flowers.\n\nHow does it all work? We'll come to that in a moment. First, a pollen primer:\n\nBasically, pollen is a container. It holds the male half of future offspring's genetic material. Its aim in life is to get to the female half by hook or by crook, by land or by sea, or, in this case, by wind or by bee. Wind-pollinated plants produce masses of pollen to ensure that at least some of it reaches its target. The real trouble begins when pollen is shattered into microscopic shards by changes in humidity while powerful thunderstorms suck up tremendous amounts of air and pollen from the surface of the Earth. Vigorous updrafts in thunderheads blast the pollen grains upward into the tops of clouds where the air is freezing, smashing the grains into fragments. Then the colder air sweeps back downward, swamping the draughts of air we breathe with shards of pollen.\n\nEach research partner organization involved in this study wields a unique weapon to wage the pollen war. The first weapon is a forecaster's dream.\n\nSlobodan Nickovic first conceived this DREAM, short for Dust Regional Atmospheric Model, to simulate how dust sweeps through the atmosphere across wide swaths of a continent. Now, with his assistance, the model has been modified at the University of Arizona to use pollen data instead of dust.\n\nNASA has introduced MODIS, or the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, into the pollen battle. MODIS is a sensor that resides on two NASA satellites -- Terra and Aqua. MODIS senses the growth stages of different plant species by looking at color changes that occur in the plant canopy. Certain color changes reveal when the plants are about to release their pollen hordes.\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Health's \"weapon\" takes the form of health record statistics that are crucial to the study.\n\nIn addition, the New Mexico Environmental Public Health Tracking Project and the ARES Corporation have alert systems that can be used to warn public health officials, doctors, hospitals, and schools, about incoming pollen. The health agency maintains a website that will alert the public to pollen events, and ARES Corporation's SYRIS, or Syndrome Reporting Information System, is a web-based system for alerting public health officials.\n\nFor this study, the researchers used data from MODIS to identify when and where juniper communities were pollinating. Alfredo Huete from the University of Arizona identified these time periods, via the MODIS data, for six different juniper communities throughout the U.S. southwest. These first DREAM pollen transport simulations modeled the pollen transport for 66 hours. The researchers propose next to establish a network of ground sampling stations to verify the model so it can be put to use in the future to help the pollen-endangered among us.\n\nAll of this is good news for the American public -- and for Luvall. \"I do have a selfish reason for wanting this project to succeed,\" he confesses. \"I'm allergic to tree pollen.\"\n\nRelated Stories)\u2014Washington University engineering researchers have created a new type of air-cleaning technology that could better protect human lungs from allergens, airborne viruses and ultrafine particles ...\n\n(Phys.org) -- Allergy to pollen of common ragweed is increasingly affecting patients and is second only to grass pollen in terms of incidence in the general population of many European countries.

{"text":"Air Sampling Mold Tests\n\nAir Sampling\n\nThere are two different ways mold inspectors sample airborne particulates for mold testing. Both are called impact sampling, because in this type of testing, spores collide with a medium and stick to it.\n\nCulturable Air Sampling\n\nIn culturable air sampling, mold spores are sucked by a vacuum pump into the impactor and trapped directly on the nutrient surface in a petri dish. The covered dish is then placed in an incubator at the lab and allowed to sit for a week to ten days. Only the viable mold spores germinate within and grow, often into identifiable colonies.\n\nOne drawback to culturable sampling is that even though there may be many spores of one particular type in an air sample, if they are dead they will not produce any colonies at all, yet the dead spores can still be allergenic. Also, even though they can cause allergy symptoms, most hyphae do not grow into colonies on a petri dish.\n\nAnother problem with culturable sampling is that aerosolized spores often are often part of large clusters. But when a cluster lands in a petri dish, no matter how many spores it contains, the resulting growth will appear to be only a single colony. As a result the sample may underestimate the actual concentration of spores and the exposure to allergens.\n\nCulturable sampling also will not tell you whether the spores contain mycotoxins, because in the petri dish, the fungus may not produce toxins. If you suspect that you have been exposed to mold toxins and you really want to know, hire a professional to collect a bulk sample and send it to a lab for mycotoxin analysis, because petri-dish culturing of mold spore samples alone will not suffice.\n\nMany of the do-it-yourself mold testing kits use nutrient petri dishes. This is called settle-plate testing. A petri dish is left open in a room for an hour or so and is then sent off to a lab for analysis. Unfortunately, there are a number of uncertainties with this method. For example, it's difficult to connect the growth that may occur in the petri dish with the sources of the spores, either indoors or outdoors. Also, the settle-plate test is biased toward larger spores, because they settle out of the air faster than smaller spores do. Yet it is the smaller spores that may be more problematic for sensitized individuals. And unlike impact samplers, which use pumps that can be calibrated for airflow, settle-plate testing cannot provide any information regarding the concentration of spores, so this type of sampling is useless in determining exposure levels.\n\nSpore-trap Sampling\n\nIn spore-trap sampling, air is drawn through a device by a pump and suspended particulates, including both viable and dead spores, as well as hyphae, are trapped on a sticky surface such as tape. The samples can then be stained and examined under a microscope. Spore-trap sampling is usually adequate to determine if there is a mold problem in a building, though any air sampling done indoors, whatever the type, should also include one or two samples of outdoor air for comparison \u2014 as controls, unless it is winter and the ground is frozen in which case there are few spores outdoors."}

Researchers note that COPD kills more than 100,000 people a year.\n\n\"Although smoking prevention remains paramount, controlling hazardous exposures can also have an important role in reducing COPD,\" said Paul Blanc, senior author of the study.\n\nThe study is based on interviews of more than 2,000 people.

Researchers found that chronic bronchitis, emphysema and related diseases are twice as frequent in people who have been exposed to toxic airborne substances in the workplace, regardless of whether they smoke.\n\nMore than half of the people with COPD reported that they had been exposed to airborne toxins in the workplace, while only one in three of those free of respiratory disease reported such exposure. Researchers say their analysis shows that exposure to various workplace toxins doubles the risk of COPD, and that workplace exposure is a contributing cause of 20 percent to 31 percent of the diagnosed COPD cases.\n\nIn November 2002, NIOSH reported that more than 20 million workers in the U.S. are exposed to gases, vapors, fumes and dusts that can cause COPD"}

These monitors\ncollect samples to ensure that air quality standards are being met or trying\nto be obtained and so general concentrations of criteria pollutants are\ncontinuously being monitored. There are three types of monitors, continuous,\nintermittent, and speciation:\n\nContinuous\nmonitors collect data everyday for a\n24 hr. period and is downloaded at 8 A.M. and 4\nP.M. to an EPA server. The criteria pollutants continuosly\nanalyzed are ozone, PM2.5, carbon monoxide, and sulfur\ndioxide.\n\nIntermittent\nmonitors are only run one of three\ndays for a 24 hour period from 12 midnight to 12 midnight. From a\nfilter, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is\nmanually collected, weighed, and sent for\nfurther analysis. A similar process is used for analyzing lead.\n\nSpeciation\nmonitors are only run one of six days\nfor a 24 hour period from 12 midnight to 12 midnight. Data is manually\naccessed at these monitors and then sent for further analysis. This\nmonitor uses filters to collect major components of particulate matter\nless than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5). These major components are\nsulfate, nitrate, organics, elemental carbon, and soil (NaCl is another major component if a coastal site)."}

This may be followed by incapacitation\ndue to pain or asphyxia if exposure continues. In smouldering or small, confined, in-flight fires,\nwhere the yields of organic irritants and acid gases are likely to be high and exposure times\nlong, the distressing effects of irritants, lung inflammation, and asphyxia induced by carbon\nmonoxide are likely to be the main hazards. For post-crash fires, which tend to develop rapidly\nto flashover, the time available for escape is often limited to a few minutes before conditions\nbecome lethal due to the effects of toxic smoke and heat, so that survival depends upon a rapid\negress. Visual obscuration and smoke irritancy are important during the early stages in that they\nmay reduce the speed and efficiency of escape. People have been shown to be reluctant to enter\nsmoke-Iogged areas if these are between them and an exit, and movement speeds are greatly\nreduced at optical densities above 0.5, OD\/m and even more when the smoke is irritant. Once\ncabin lining and seating materials become heavily involved in the area opposite a cabin breach,\nthen the concentrations of toxic gases, especially carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide\n(HCN), can increase rapidly further clown the cabin, causing rapid incapacitation of any\nremaining cabin occupants. This is followed or accompanied by extreme heat, so that deaths\nresult from asphyxia and\/or heat shock. For in-flight fires, it is recommended that consideration\nshould be given to reducing the hazard from irritants. For post-crash fires, measures aimed at\ndelaying the involvement of cabin contents (such as spray mist systems) should be considered.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe majority of fat and nonfatal casualties from fires result from exposure to toxic\nsmoke, but there can be considerable differences between different types of fires in terms of the\nsmoke composition and the ways in which it affects people in different fire scenarios. Fires in\naircraft may be classified into two very different major categories, the in-flight fire and the post-\ncrash fire.\nAircraft occupants in flight may be many hours from possible landing and\ndisembarkation, so that any fire that grows rapidly and penetrates the cabin space is likely to be\nfatal, due to asphyxiation of the occupants and loss of the aircraft. Fortunately such occurrences\nare rare, but of equal concern must be the small nonflaming or flaming Ore, particularly in a\n*Copyright, British Crown\n**Building Research Establishment, Fire Research Station, Garston, Watford, U.K.\ni75\n\nOCR for page 176\n176\nImp roved Fire- aru] Smoke-Resistant Mate rz als\nconfined space. This may result in contamination of the cabin atmosphere with a low\nconcentration of toxic smoke that may have to be endured for a number of hours. In such\nsituations the major concerns must be initially the psychological and physiological effects on\npassengers and crew of exposure to an irritant and optically obscure smoke, and then the\nasphyxiation hazards presented by lung inflammation and graclual intoxication by asphyxiant\ngases such as carbon monoxide, both of which may lead to long-term respiratory tract and neural\n\u00b7 ~\nc amage in survivors.\nPost-crash fire scenarios are very different because they often involve large, rapidly\ngrowing fires resulting from fuel involvement, which may enter the cabin through breaches and\nresult in rapid cabin flashover. Also, because the aircraft is on the ground, rapid passenger\negress or rescue may be possible. In this situation the key factors are the time within which the\npassengers can disembark compared with the rate of fire growth and particularly the time within\nwhich toxic smoke and heat impair or prevent egress.\nThis paper examines fire scenarios in terms of toxic smoke and heat profiles and presents\nmethods for estimating behavioural impairment and incapacitation.\nPRACTICAL METHODS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF FACTORS\nDETERMINING HAZARD TO LIFE IN IVIES\nFrom the point of view of parameters directly related to the fire process, the development\nof behavioral impairment and hazard to life depends upon two major parameters:\nI. The time-concentration (or intensity) curves for the major toxic products, optically\ndense smoke, and heat in the fire at the breathing zone of the occupants, which in\nturn depend upon:\nthe fire-growth curve in terms of the mass-Ioss rate of the fuel (kg\/s) and the\nvolume into which it is dispersed (kg\/m3~; and\nthe yield of toxic-products smoke and heat in the fire (e.g., kgCO\/kg of material\nburned).\n2. The toxic potency of the products (the exposure concentration [kg\/m3], or exposure\ndose [kg min\/m3 or ppm mind required to cause toxic effects (and the equivalent\neffects of heat and smoke obscuration), the assessment of which requires\nconsideration of three aspects:\nexposure concentrations or doses likely to impair or reduce the efficiency of\negress due to psychological and\/or physiological effects;\nexposure concentrations or doses likely to produce incapacitation or prevent\negress due to psychological and\/or physiological effects; and\nlethal exposure concentrations or doses.\n\nOCR for page 177\nDavid Purser\n177\nThere are essentially two practical methods assessing these factors:\nI. from large-scale fire tests including measurements of the concentration-time profiles\nof the major toxic gases, heat, and smoke optical density, and from existing\nknowledge of the effects of exposure to these agents; and\n2. from a battery of small-scale tests and mathematical models, or simple large-scale\ntests, where the essential elements are:\n\u00b7 the toxic potency data for the materials (lethal mass-Ioss exposure dose\n[am min\/m31) obtained from small-scale tests; and\nthe mass-Ioss\/concentration curve for the fire.\nFrom the point of view of understanding effects on people in fires, full-scale fire tests\nare the most valuable, since they enable the concentration-time profiles of the heat and toxic\nsmoke to be measured directly at different levels and positions within the fire. In practice,\nhowever, elements of both methods are useful in making an overall assessment. The second\nmethod is used mainly for evaluating materials with regard to the lethal toxic potency of\npotential fire atmospheres. In order to enable the effects of exposure of people to fire hazards\nto be calculated, a series of algorithms has been developed for calculating time to incapacitation\nor death, which is published in The SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering (Purser,\n1988), in a NATO-AGARD (Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development) paper\non aircraft fires (Purser, 1989), and in BST (British Standards Institution) and TSO (International\nStandards Organization) technical reports (BS1:, 1989; TSO, 1994~.\nPhysiological Hazards In Fires\nThe physiological effects of exposure to toxic smoke and heat in fires result in varying\ndegrees of incapacitation, which may also lead to death or permanent injury (Purser, 19881.\nIncapacitating effects include:\na. Impaired vision resulting from the optical opacity of smoke and from the painful\neffects of irritant smoke products and heat on the eyes.\nb. Respiratory tract pain and breathing difficulties or even respiratory tract injury\nresulting from the inhalation of irritant smoke, which may be very hot. In extreme\ncases this can lead to collapse within a few minutes from asphyxia due to laryngeal\nspasm and\/or bronchoconstriction. Lung inflammation may also occur, usually after\nsome hours, which can also lead to varying degrees of respiratory distress.\nNarcosis from the inhalation of toxic gases, resulting in confusion and loss of\nconsciousness.\nd. Pain to exposed skin and the upper respiratory tract followed by burns, or\nhyperthermia, due to He effects of heat, preventing escape and leading to collapse.\nAll of these effects can lead to permanent injury, and all except (a) can be fatal if the\ndegree of exposure is sufficient.\n\nOCR for page 178\n178\nImproved Fire- aru] Smoke-Resistant Materials\nWith regard to hazard assessment the major considerations are:\nI. the time when partially incapacitating effects that might delay escape are likely to\noccur;\n2. the time when incapacitating effects that might prevent escape are likely to occur,\ncompared with the time required for escape; and\n3. whether exposure is likely to result in permanent injury or death.\nUp to a certain level of severity, the hazards listed in (a)-~) above cause a partial\nincapacitation by reducing the efficiency and speed of escape. These effects lie on a continuum\nfrom tilde or no effect at low levels to relatively severe incapacitation at high levels, with a\nvariable response from different individuals. ye is important to make some estimate of effects that\nare likely to delay escape; these effects may decrease the number of occupants able to escape\nduring the short time before conditions become so bad that escape is no longer possible. Most\nimportant in this context is exposure to optically dense and irritant smoke, which tends to be the\nfirst hazard confronting fire victims. For more severe exposures, a point may be reached where\nincapacitation will prevent escape. For some forms of incapacitation, such as the point where\nnarcosis leads to a rapid change from near normality through a brief period of intoxication, to\nloss of consciousness, this point is relatively easy to define. For other effects an endpoint is less\neasily defined; examples are the point where smoke becomes so irritant that pain and breathing\ndifficulties lead to the cessation of effective escape attempts, or the point where pain and burns\nprevent movement. Nevertheless it is considered important to attempt some estimate of the point\nwhere conditions become so severe in terms of these hazards that effective escape attempts are\nlikely to cease, and where occupants are likely to suffer severe incapacitation or injuries.\nIn addition to the physiological effects of exposure to toxic smoke, there are\npsychological factors to be considered in relation to smoke exposure. This aspect is largely\nbeyond the scope of this paper but some aspects are mentioned in the next section.\nEvaluation of the Effects of Optically Dense, Irritant Smoke\non the Eyes and Respiratory Tract\nOptically dense smoke affects way-f~nding ability and the speed of movement of\noccupants, and a smoke barrier may be perceived as being impenetrable. These effects depend\nupon the concentration topical density) of the smoke and its irritancy to the eyes and respiratory\ntract. In experiments where people were asked to walk down a smoke-Iogged corridor, fin\n(1976) found that for nonirritant smoke, walking speed decreased with smoke density, and that\nat an optical density of 0.5 OD\/m (extinction coefficient 1 . 15) walking speed decreased from\napproximately I.2 m\/s (no smoke) to 0.3 m\/s. Under these conditions people behaved as if they\n,\n\u00b7 . . ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ .~ \u00b7 ~ .a a~ ~~ ~ ~ ~ . \u00b7 \u00b7 . .\nwere in total darkness, teelmg their way along the walls. when people were exposed to lrrltaIlt\nsmoke, made by heating wood chippings, movement speed was reduced to that in darkness at\na much lower optical density (0.2 OD\/m, extinction coefficient 0.5), and the experience was\nfound to be more distressing.\n\nOCR for page 179\nDavid Purser\n179\nIn addition to these effects upon movement speed, there is the problem of deciding\nwhether people will move at all. In a number of studies of fires in buildings, a proportion of\npeople (approximately 30 percent) were found to {urn back rather than continue through smoke-\nlogged areas (Wood, 1972; Bryan, 19771. The average density at which people turned back was\nat a \"visibility\" distance of 3 m (0.33 OD\/m), and women were more likely to turn back than\nmen. A difficulty with this kind of statistic is that in many fires in buildings there is a choice\nbetween passing through smoke to an exit or turning back to take refuge in a place of relative\nsafety, such as a closed room. In some situations people have moved through very dense smoke\nwhen the fire was behind them, while in other cases people have failed to move at all. In a post-\ncrash (or grounded) aircraft fire it seems likely that the majority of people will attempt to move\nthrough even dense smoke towards an exit, especially if layering permits them to crouch down\nto levels where the smoke density is lower and if low-level lighting is used to improve viability.\nHowever, it is likely that some people will not move through dense smoke.\nSmoke irritants consist of inorganic acid gases (such as hydrogen chlorides and organic\ncompounds, particularly low molecular weight aldehydes (formaldehyde and acrolein). More\nthan 20 irritant substances have been detected in smoke, and it is considered that others remain\nto be identified (Purser, 1988~. The first effect of exposure to smoke irritants is sensory\nirritation, which consists of painful stimulation of the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs. Sensory\nirritation depends upon the immediate concentration of irritants to which the subject is exposed\nrather than a dose acquired over a period of time, the effects {yin\" on a con cinuum from mild\neye irritation to severe eye and respiratory tract pain. In evaluating this aspect of irritancy the\naim is to predict what concentration of mixed irritant products is likely to cause such pain and\ndifficulty in breathing that escape attempts would be stowed or rendered less efficient, and what\nconcentration is likely to seriously disrupt or prevent escape (a degree of incapacitation\napproximately equivalent to that at the point of collapse resulting from exposure to narcotic\ngases). For example, with regard to hydrogen chloride it is considered that concentrations of\napproximately 100-500 ppm would be painfully irritant, and that the effects might slow escape\nbut probably not prevent it. However, at approximately 1,000 ppm and above it is suggested that\nthe effects might be so severe as to prevent escape (Purser, 1988, 1989~. In the absence of\ndetailed information on irritant mixtures it is assumed that all irritants would be additive in their\neffects, since they are all capable of causing damage to lung tissue. In large-scale fire tests it is\npossible to measure inorganic irritants directly, but it is difficult to assess the degree of irritancy\nfrom organic products, which form a very important component. In general the effects of\norganic irritants depend on the concentration of partially oxidised organic species in the smoke.\nFor example, smokes from smouldering wood or polyolefins have a high organic content and\nare highly irritant; they are characterized by low CO2\/CO ratios and high smoke yields. Under\nwell-ventilated flaming conditions, by contrast, the organic content of the effluents is low and\nirntancy is low. In general, it is predicted that smoke from a mixed fuel source with an optical\nden sity\/metre of 0.5 would be strongly irritant to the eyes and respiratory tract Olin, 1976;\nPurser, 1988~. However, for a given smoke density there are differences between different types\nof fires, since some people report that smoke from some fires, while dense optically, is\nrelatively tow in irntancy, while that from other fires is extremely irritant.\nIt is difficult to quantify these irritant effects because the database on the effects of\nindividual irritants or irritant mixtures on escape behaviour in humans is poor and because the\n\nOCR for page 180\n180\nImproved Fire- arm Smoke-Resistant Materials\neffects lie on a continuum of seventy where there are no precise endpoints. Assessment has to\nbe based upon a small number of human expenmental exposures (usually at relatively low\nconcentrations), accidental exposures, and He results of bioassay studies. The most useful\nbioassay method for sensory incitation has been the mouse RDso test, in which the concentration\ncausing a 50 percent decrease in respiration rate following a short exposure is measured. A\nreasonably good relationship has been found between the mouse RDso concentrations for a range\nof irritant vapours and the concentrations reported as being painfully irritant to humans (Alane,\n19811. The test has been applied to a wide range of irritant substances, many of which occur in\nfire atmospheres, and also to mixed combustion product atmospheres.\nIn order to assess the combined effects of irritants, a concept of fractional irritant\nconcentration (FIC) has been developed (Purser, 1993), whereby the concentration of each\nirritant present is expressed as a fraction of the concentration considered to be severely irritant\nto humans. The irritant concentration for each gas has been set on the basis of data from both\nhuman and animal studies. The FICs for each irritant are then summed to give a total FIC. If\nthe total FIC reaches unity, then it is predicted that the smoke atmosphere would be highly\nirritant, sufficient to slow down escape attempts. If the total greatly exceeds unity then it is\nlikely that escape would be prevented, and it is possible that collapse might occur due to static\nhypoxia from bronchoconstriction or laryngeal spasm. On the basis of available data, current\nestimates of the concentrations of each gas likely to be highly irritant are as follows:\nToxic gas\nHC1\nHBr\nHF\nso2\nNO2\nTotal organics\nConcentration\n200 ppm\n200 ppm\n120 ppm\n30 ppm\n80 ppm (5 min) 25 ppm (30 min)\n0.5 OD\/m\nOn the basis of the assumption that all irritants capable of damaging lung tissue are\nadditive in their effects, the overall irritant concentration FIC~ is then given by\nF}C,rr = FICHE + FICHE + FICHE + FICS02 + FICNO2 + FICorg\nAnother way of expressing the sensory irritancy of fire effluent is in terms of the RDso of the\nmaterial decomposed (expressed as the mass-loss concentration), rather than in terms of\nindividual irritant products. Table ~ shows the mouse RDso for a number of materials, some of\nwhich are used in aircraft, when decomposed under the thermal decomposition conditions\nindicated, using the FRS tube furnace method (Purser et al., 19941. The majority of experiments\nwere conducted under nonflaming oxidative decomposition conditions, but a small number of\nexperiments were conducted under flaming decomposition conditions. The results show that the\n\nOCR for page 182\n182\nImproved Fire- aru] Smoke-Resistant Materials\nlung. If a sufficient dose is inhaled over a period of time a lung inflammatory response can\noccur, usually some hours after exposure. This may cause respiratory failure and death, or\npermanent lung damage in survivors. The 30-minute exposure concentrations likely to be lethal\nused for each irritant gas (based upon rat LCso data) are as follows:\nToxic gas Concentration\nHC1\nHBr\nHE\nso2\nNO2\n3,800 ppm\n3,800 ppm\n2,900 ppm\n400 ppm\n170 ppm (30 min), 375 ppm (5 min)\nTotal organics 3 OD\/m\nThe effects depend upon the exposure dose, which can be quantified approximately in\nterms of the product of concentration (c) and exposure lime (I) to give the ct product exposure\ndose (ppm\/min). During a fire, when the concentrations of the toxic products vary with time,\nit is possible to predict when an incapacitating or lethal dose has been received by using the\nfractional effective dose (FED) method. For this method the ct product doses for small periods\nof time during the fire are expressed as a fraction of the dose causing a toxic effect, and these\nFEDs are summed until the fraction reaches unity, when the toxic effect is predicted. The\nfraction of a lethal dose (FED) for each irritant is calculated as the ct product exposure dose\nduring a period in the fire (e.g., in ppm\/min) expressed as a fraction of the lethal exposure dose.\nThe lethal effects of the different irritants are assumed to be additive on the same basis as the\nirritant effects, so that the total FEDirr for each time period is given by\nFED,rr = FEDHC~ + FEDHBr + FEDHP + FEDS02 + FEDN02 + FED\u00b0rg (2)\nCalculation of Time to Incapacitation Due to Effects of Narcotic Gases\nNarcotic gases (carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, and reduced\noxygen) affect the nervous and cardiovascular systems, causing confusion followed by loss of\nconsciousness, followed ultimately by death from asphyxiation (Purser, 19881. As narcotic gases\nare inhaled during a fire, an increasing dose builds up in the body. There is lithe effect initially,\nbut when a critical threshold dose level is reached severe effects occur suddenly. These consist\nof a brief period of intoxication (similar to severe alcohol intoxication), followed by a collapse\ninto unconsciousness (Purser, 19881. Where several narcotic gases are present the effects have\nbeen found to be additive, with carbon dioxide mainly causing an increase in the rate of uptake\nof the other narcotic gases. It has also been shown that the effects of irritant gases such as\nhydrogen chloride (MCI) are additive with those of carbon monoxide (Hartzell et al., 1985~.\n\nOCR for page 183\nDavid Purser\n~3\nBased upon these findings, an FED equation to predict time to incapacitation (loss of\nconsciousness from the effects of narcotic gases for humans) has been developed as follows:\nFEDIN-(FEDS + FEDS + FED,rr) x VCO2 + FEDS or FIN, (3)\nwhere\nFEDS fraction of an incapacitating dose of all narcotic gases;\nFEDS fraction of an incapacitating dose of CO;\nFEDS = fraction of an incapacitating dose of HCN;\nFEDS-fraction of an irritant dose contributing to hypoxia;\nVCO2-multiplication factor for CO2-induced hyperventilation;\nFEDS = fraction of an incapacitating dose of low oxygen hypoxia; and\nFED~Co2 - fraction of an incapacitating dose of CO2.\nEach individual term in the FED equation is itself the result of the following equations,\nwhich give the FED for incapacitation for each gas and the multiplication factor for CO2, where\nt is the exposure time at a particular concentration in minutes. The FED s acquired over each\nperiod of time during the fire are summed until the total FEDIN reaches unity, at which point\nincapacitation floss of consciousness) is predicted.

A FED\nequation for heat has been developed similar to that for a narcotic gas, as follows:\nFEDIh ~ I\/exp(5. 1849 - 0.0273 temp \u00b0C) .\n(9)\nFor radiant heat, skin pain and burns occur rapidly at intensities above 0.25 W\/cm2 (Purser,\n1988~. Details of the calculation methods are given in Purser, 1988 and 1989.\nAPPLICATION OF THE INCAPACITATION MODEL\nTO DIFFERENT FIRE SCENARIOS\nIn terms of the basic scenarios, the hazards in terms of the yields of heat, smoke, and\ntoxic products, and the effects on escape behaviour, fires can be considered in several different\ncategories. The main categories are\n1. nonflaming or smoulder~ng fires where the victim is in the compartment of fire\norigin or in a remote location;\n2. early-flaming, well-ventilated fires where the victim is in the compartment of fire\norigin or in a remote location;\nsmall, restricted-ventilation fires where the victim is in the compartment of fire\n\u00b7 -\nong1n; and\n\nOCR for page 185\nDavid Purser\n~5\n4. ventilation-controlled post-flashover fires with low and high ventilation, where the\nvictim is remote from the fire, either inside a very large compartment or outside the\nfire compartment.\nIn the context of aircraft fires, the first three categories are of concern mainly in the in-\nflight situation, where cabin occupants and crew may be exposed to fire effluent for several\nhours. Although fires in categories 2 and 3 may also present a hazard on the ground, it is to be\nexpected that the aircraft would be cleared before such fires become a serious threat. The main\nhazard on the ground is therefore from fires, usually involving fuel, that rapidly grow very large\nand cause rapid flashover inside the cabin.\nNonflam~ng or Smoulder~ng Fires\nNonflaming or smouldering decomposition results in high yields of organic irritants from\nmaterials, and high yields of inorganic irritants from materials containing the appropriate\nelements. These smoke irritants are predicted to cause distress upon initial exposure, due to the\npainful effects upon the eyes and lungs. As Table ~ shows, very small amounts of material can\nproduce severely irritant atmospheres if decomposed under these conditions. Cases have occurred\nwhere the decomposition of a few tens of grams of cable insulation material have rendered large\nbuildings uninhabitable for a number of hours. Prolonged exposure to these irritants over periods\nof an hour or more may lead to lung inflammation, while carbon monoxide intoxication may also\noccur.\nA number of deaths each year result from fires in buildings that are considered to have\nundergone a prolonged period of smoulder~ng. This may occur in items of furniture, or in\nstructural items such as flooring, or in concealed cavities, sometimes initially involving\nshouldering cables. A recent case involving a number of deaths resulted from smouldering\nfloorboards and joists. Nonflaming decomposition is slow, so that a relatively long time\n(approximately an hour or more) is required for the development of hazardous conditions.\nHowever, although small masses of material may be decomposed, the yields of carbon monoxide\ncan be high, and these conditions generally provide the highest yields of irritant organic\nproducts. The major hazard is to a sleeping or otherwise incapacitated occupant of a closet!\nroom, or to aircraft occupants in flight who may be overcome by carbon monoxide and lung-\ndamaging irritant smoke.\nA good example of such a situation is presented by a series of tests carried out at the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (Braun et al., iL987; Purser, 1990) where two\ntypes of armchair made from a standard and a fire-retarded (FR) polyurethane foam with cotton\ncovers (combustible mass 5.7 kg) (see Tables 3 and 4) were burned in a simulated small\napartment (volume 101 m3) consisting of a burn room (~.8 m3) connected via a corridor 12 m\nlong to a target room (volume 12.08 my. The chairs were tested by flaming ignition of the seat\nback, and also by smouldering caused by one or two cigarettes placed in the seat angle for\napproximately ~ hour, followed either by spontaneous flaming or ignition from a flaming source.\nUnder smouldering conditions, approximately ~ kg of foam was decomposed in just over ~ hour.\n\nOCR for page 187\nDavid Purser\n187\nThe smoke layer had reached the floor after an hour, but there was a concentration gradient for\nsmoke and toxic gases between the burn room and the target room. The major narcotic gas\npresent was CO, which gradually increased in concentration in the burn room from 180 ppm\nduring the first 13 minutes to 1,000 ppm at 67-75 minutes. This was sufficient to have caused\nincapacitation floss of consciousness) in just over 1 hour in the burn room but probably not in\nthe target room, where the concentration was lower. When flaming ignition occurred, the chair\nburned very rapidly and produced high concentrations of narcotic gases, which would have been\nalmost immediately fatal in the burn room. Within the target room an occupant would have\nbecome unconscious within less than 1 minute and received a fatal dose within 2 minutes. The\nsmoke in the system was also very irritant, and it is likely that anyone spending more than 1\nhour in the burn room would have suffered serious and possibly fatal lung damage, even if they\nhad been rescued. This example illustrates the dangers of smouldering, which can continue for\nseveral hours and spread lethal products throughout a building. It is therefore dangerous to a\nsleeping, trapped, or otherwise incapacitated occupant. Since such fires often change to flaming\nbefore they are discovered, it is difficult to know the true incidence of incapacitation and death\noccurring during the nonflaming phase of fires. For this example both the standard and FR\nchairs would have caused incapacitation after ~ hour in the burn room, but due to its higher\nyield of CO and irritants, the FR chair would also cause incapacitation in the target room soon\nafter, and death in the burn room after I.5 hours of smouldenng. For the standard foam, death\nat both locations would occur within ~ minute of the spontaneous transition to flaming after 75\nminutes.\nEarly-Flannog, WeN-Ventilated Fires In a Room with an Open Doorway\nIn early-flaming fires, the decomposition conditions, particularly the air\/fuel ratio, and\nthe type of fuel are major determinants of the yields of toxic gases. In early-flaming, well-\nventilated fires involving non-fire-retarde`d materials, combustion is usually efficient, so that the\nmain products are heat, carbon dioxide, and water, the yields of toxic products and smoke being\nrelatively low. However, when inefficiently burning materials are present, or when the fire\n~ or _ ,~ ,\ngrows to a large size relative to that of the compartment, so that the ventilation may become\nrestricted even with an open doorway, then toxic products may become important as well as\nheat. The example shown in Table 5 gives the results obtained during the first 5 minutes of a\nburn with flaming ignition of a rather bad single armchair (polystyrene with polyurethane\ncushions and covers) in a room with an open doorway. For an occupant of the room during the\nfire the following effects are predicted:\nI. Towards the end of the second minute and the beginning of the third minute, the\nsmoke optical density and mass loss would sufficiently exceed the escape limitation\nthresholds for visual obscuration and sensory irritation to severely inhibit escape from\nthe room.\n2. During the fourth minute, the average temperature is 220 \u00b0C, and sufficient heat\nwould be accumulated in the skin surface to cause skin burns resulting in\nincapacitation.\n\nOCR for page 189\nDavid Purser\n~9\nsection. For flaming fires on the ground, He main consideration is the fire-growth rate and the\ntime required for the occupants to disembark. Although aircraft materials have a high standard\nof fire resistance, it is possible to conceive of a number of situations in which rapid fire growth\ncould occur.\nWith regard to people's perception of the smoke from these and other fires, there seems\nto be a considerable variation in the effects, depending upon what is burning. For example, in\na recent fire a cotton-covered coconut-matting sofa burned in an open room in a two-story\napartment. The apartment and the corridor outside it became logged with a thick smoke, but a\nnumber of persons were able to move through the smoke without difficulty (although the\noccupants perceived the smoke to be too dangerous to escape through and retreated to a\nbedroom, from which they were rescued). In some situations it is possible to account for effects\non fire victims in terms of the classical toxicology models described, but in others the smoke\nappears to be much worse than would be predicted. For example, a fire fighter reported that he\ninhaled a whiff of smoke from the burning interior of a car and immediately almost fainted. In\nsome major fire disasters, such as the Woolworth fire in Manchester (England) in May 1979 and\nthe Dupont Plaza Hotel fire, victims have been found dead, sitting at tables with food, in the\nlatter case only a few feet from a safe exit. Such individuals have apparently been overcome by\nsmoke inhalation so quickly that they have been unable to move, possibly by a single breath of\nsmoke. It would seem that this would be most likely to occur to a victim remote from the site\nof a pre- or post-flashover fire that has become vitiated, who is suddenly exposed to smoke\ncontaining a very low oxygen concentration and very high concentrations of toxic effluents.\nSmall, Restr~cted-Ventilation fires In Closed Compartments\nAnother very hazardous situation is that of a fire in a closed room. In this situation a\nsmouldering or especially a flaming fire quickly uses up the available oxygen, and as the oxygen\nconcentration falls after a minute or so the combustion becomes inefficient, producing a dense\nsmoke rich in carbon monoxide and other toxic products. These, together with the lowered\noxygen concentration in a room, can produce a rapidly lethal atmosphere. An example is a\nrecent fire involving an adult and a 4-year-old child. Both were in a small bedroom for a short\ntime during which the adult went to sleep and the child is thought to have ignited a small piece\nof foam using a cigarette lighter. The fire was discovered after a few minutes, when the door\nwas opened by a family member, who extinguished the very small fire with a bucket of water.\nBoth the adult and child were dead, with blood carboxyhaemogIobin concentrations of about half\na lethal level. Based upon the dimensions of the room, it is calculated that the decomposition of\napproximately 0.5 kg of material would be sufficient to lower the oxygen concentration towards\n10 percent and give carbon monoxide concentrations of approximately ~ percent or more, which\ntogether with other toxic products would cause incapacitation and death within a few minutes.\nIn an aircraft in flight, a small, poorly ventilated, flaming fire could therefore present a serious\nhazard from the high yields of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide and the consumption of\noxygen.\n\nOCR for page 190\n190\nImproved Fire- arid Smoke-Resistant Materials\nIbUy Develope~Post-Flashover Fires\nThe final situation to consider is that where the occupants are remote from the site of a\nlarge fire, either in a large compartment or at a location remote from the fire compartment. This\nis the situation leading to the major multiple-death disasters, and against which most regulatory\nrequirements for passive and active fire protection are designed to provide protection. Once a\nfire has reached a large size, the rate of burning and of the evolution of heat and toxic smoke\nis very great, so that even a large building can be rapidly fitted with smoke. The decomposition\nconditions in such fires depend upon the ventilation, but most fully developed fires in buildings\ntend to be hot and oxygen vitiated. These conditions favour inefficient combustion, with high\nyields of dense smoke containing high concentrations of carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide,\nand low oxygen. An example of such a fire is the penetration of a large external fuel fire into\nthe cabin of an aircraft, as happened in the Manchester Airtours fire (King, 1989~. Table 6\nshows the results obtained inside the cabin of a Boeing 707 containing a few rows of seats\nopposite an open doorway, outside which were 200 litres (50 U.S. gallons) of burning aviation\nfuel (Avtur) (Fardell and Purser, 19911. The rapid involvement of the cabin contents gave rise\nto a dense smoke containing large amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide at a\nmeasurement point halfway down the fuselage. It is predicted that escape capability is likely to\nbe severely inhibited after approximately I-~.5 minutes due to the effects of exposure to the\ndense smoke containing high concentrations of acid gases and organic irritants. Severe\nincapacitation floss of consciousness) is predicted afteriust 2 minutes, followed rapidly by death,\nmainly from the effects of hydrogen cyanide (high concentrations of which were found in the\nblood of the Manchester victims).\nAlthough in many large fires the original fuel and the major source of heat and toxic\nproducts may be the contents, a significant contribution may be made by construction products.\nOf great importance in some cases are surface coverings or components with a large surface area\nsuch as doors or partitions. Surface coverings may contribute to flashover spread (as in the\nDublin Stardust disco fire) and may release a bolus of toxic products very quickly, which may\nhave a serious incapacitating effect on victims. An example would be viny} wall coverings or\nthe viny} laminates used in aircraft cabins. Polyviny~chIoride releases all its hydrogen chloride\nat a low temperature (approximately 250-300 \u00b0C), so that as a fire develops and the hot layer\nreaches this temperature, hydrogen chloride (MCI) may be suddenly released. In another aircraft\nfire test conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration, high concentrations of HC! and\nhydrogen fluoride (HF) occurred in the cabin atmosphere before other gases reached toxic levels\n(see Purser, 19891.\nIn general, although in some cases fire and heat may eventually kill victims, this is\nusually preceded by dense, highly toxic smoke that can spread rapidly throughout a space or a\nbuilding, and it is this that is usually responsible for the initial incapacitation of occupants, as\nwell as being the cause of many deaths.\n\nOCR for page 193\nDavid Purser\n193\nRECOMMENI)ATIONS TO ENHANCE SURVIVABILITY\nIN AIRCRAFT FIRE ACCIDENTS\nThe development of hazardous situations in a fire involves a wide range of factors. These\ninclude fire development, from ignition to He post-flashover spread of fire and smoke; toxicity;\nthe interaction of the fire with the structure and with passive and active fire protection; and\nescape-related factors including deeechon, warnings, the provision of escape routes, way-finding,\nphysiological and behavioural impairment, and escape movements or rescue. In designing a\nsystem to be safe in fire, all these factors should be considered, and the ultimate evaluation of\nsafety depends upon whether it is possible to ensure, by performing a life-threat hazard and risk\nassessment, that the occupants can reasonably be expected to have escaped before they are\nexposed to levels of heat and smoke that may endanger health and threaten life.\nIn the context of aircraft fires, there are a number of strategies that could be adopted to\nenhance survivability in aircraft fire accidents. The considerations differ somewhat between in-\nflight fires and post-crash fires.\nIn-Flight Fires\nThe foremost considerations with regard to in-flight fires must be prevention, limitation,\ndetection, suppression, and compartmentation. Aircraft materials, design, and construction are\nall planned with fire prevention in mind. Materials, particularly cabin lining and seating\nmaterials, are currency selected with a high fire-performance specification in terms of\nignitability. Ignitability, flame spread, and heat release characteristics are all very important in\nterms of fire initiation and growth. Toxic potency criteria may also be a consideration in terms\nof materials selection. For fires in concealed spaces, early detection and the provision of\nsuppression systems are very important. Containment and fire stopping is doubly important.\nFirst, if the fire occurs in a sealed space it will self-extinguish, and second, penetration of toxic\nsmoke generated in the early stages of the fire into occupied areas is less likely to occur.\nFires involving wire and cable can present a problem in smoldering or small flaming fires\ndue to the organic irritants and acid gases that evolve. Materials with an improved flame\npropagation and higher decomposition temperature performance may be advantageous, provided\nthat they do not evolve high toxicity products when they are overheated (Purser et al., 19941.\nIn situations where the cabin or cockpit atmosphere becomes contaminated with smoke\nfrom small in-flight fires, it may be important to minimize the inhalation of irritant smoke. This\nmight be done by increasing the rate of cabin air change to reduce smoke concentration, or in\nextreme cases by using oxygen masks Provided that the fire is not in the cabin).\nConsideration should also be given to the psychological effects of being trapped for some\nhours in an irritant-smoke atmosphere.\n\nOCR for page 194\n194\nImproved Fire- aru] Smoke-Resistant Materials\nFires on the Ground\nif the aircraft is on the ground the main hazard is from rapidly growing fires, of which\na post-crash fire involving fuel is the most serious. As shown in Table 6, such fires can render\nthe cabin untenable within a few minutes. The main methods for improving survivability must\ntherefore be to delay the spread of fire into the cabin, and then the fire involvement of the cabin\ninterior, while achieving rapid evacuation. Improved ignitability and fire-growth performance\nof materials have gone some way towards improving the fire performance of seats and other\ncabin materials, but large external fuel fires are still capable of igniting cabin materials in a short\ntime. Low-volume water mist systems have been shown to provide a significant benefit in some\nsituations by delaying cabin interior involvement in the fire.\nOther problems in this scenario impeding evacuation may be the presence of dense,\nirritant smoke and high concentrations of hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide. The evolution\nof irritants may be reduced by choosing cabin lining materials that do not evolve high HC! and\nsmoke yields at relatively low temperatures. It might also be an advantage to avoid or protect\nmaterials likely to evolve high yields of HCN, such as polyurethanes.\nOther aspects to consider are ways of improving passenger egress. Better protection to\navoid physical injury in crashes, less cabin baggage in upper stowage bins, wider aisles and\nmore exits, good low-level lighting and signage, and similar methods might improve movement\nability. Improved warnings in case of emergency, such as encouraging passengers to make an\nescape game plan in advance, could also be beneficial.\nREFERENCES\nAlane, Y. 1981.

{"text":"Known to be a human carcinogen\nFirst Listed in the Second Annual Report on Carcinogens (1981)Carcinogenicity\nCoke oven emissions are known to be human carcinogens based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans that indicates a causal relationship between exposure and cancer in humans.\n\nPrior to 1950, there were numerous case reports that linked employment in coke production with cancers of the skin, bladder, and respiratory tract. Since then, several cohort studies conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Sweden have reported an increased risk of lung\ncancer in humans exposed to coke oven emissions.\nSmoking was accounted for in some of these studies and was not found to be a significant confounding factor.\"\n\nA large cohort study of 59,000 steelworkers reported that lung cancer risk increased with increasing duration of exposure to coke-oven fumes or intensity of exposure. Several studies\nof coke plant workers have reported an increased risk for kidney cancer.\nAn excess of cancer at other sites (prostate, large intestine, and pancreas) was reported in single studies (IARC 1984, 1987).\n\nCoke oven emission samples applied weekly to the skin of mice for up to 52 weeks caused malignant skin tumors. These samples also showed tumor-initiating activity in mice. Several inhalation studies, using coal tar aerosols generated by samples collected from coke ovens, caused both benign and malignant lung tumors in rats and mice, and skin tumors in female mice.\nChemical analyses of coke oven emissions revealed the presence of numerous known carcinogens and potentially carcinogenic chemicals, including several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrosamines, coal tar,arsenic compounds, and benzene. In addition to these carcinogens, coke oven emissions contain several agents known to enhance the effect of\nchemical carcinogens, especially on the respiratory tract.\n\nExposure\nThe primary routes of potential human exposure to coke oven emissions are inhalation and dermal contact. Occupational exposure may occur during the production of coke from coal or while using coke to extract metals from their ores, to synthesize calcium carbide, or to manufacture graphite and electrodes.\nWorkers at coking plants and coal tar production plants, as well as the residents surrounding these plants, have a high risk of possible exposure to coke oven emissions.\n ... 49coke.pdf\n\n\"In fact the first observations on an appreciable rise in the frequency of lung cancer were reported from the highly industrialized cities of densely populated Saxony during the first two decades of this century. Some years later it was found that high lung cancer rates existed for the population of the industrialized territory of the Ruhr valley, while they were below average for the agricultural region of the Main valley.\"\n\n\n ... eID=896717\n\nGermany's Synthetic Fuel Industry 1927-45\n\"First, Germany became increasingly dependent on gasoline and diesel oil engines.The appearance of automobiles, trucks and then airplanes made a plentiful supply of gasoline essential. Moreover, ocean going ships increasingly used diesel oil rather than coal as their energy source\"\n\n\n\"This development is comparable with the direct liquefaction of coal (developed by IG Farben in the thirties), which also has greater thermal efficiency (up to 63%) than gasification of coal followed by FT synthesis (about 44 % with coal, but about 70% with natural gas). Both processes, the direct liquefaction and the Fischer-Tropsch technology, are currently going through a renaissance in China because the low raw material and wage costs allow economic coal liquefaction.\"\n ... _tank.html\n\n\" But liquid coal comes with substantial environmental and economic negatives. On the environmental side, the polluting properties of coal\u2014starting with mining and lasting long after burning\u2014and the large amounts of energy required to liquefy it mean that liquid coal produces more than twice the global warming emissions as regular gasoline and almost double those of ordinary diesel. As pundits have pointed out, driving a Prius on liquid coal makes it as dirty as a Hummer on regular gasoline\"\n\n\nThe fact that about one third of the subjects surveyes smoked moderately or not at all indicates the presence of other cancerigenic factors besides smoking, such as influenza and industrial working conditions.\nThe great significance of the latter can be inferred from various indications but needs further study\n\n\nWho Owns Aniline?\n\"But it was formed under the auspices of I.

The State of California considers over 40 chemicals in diesel exhaust as toxic air contaminants (see Table 1).\nExposure to this mixture may result in cancer, respiratory effects and other health problems.\n\nCalifornia's Scientific Review Panel has unanimously endorsed the official listing of diesel exhaust as a toxic air contaminant, due to its cancer and non-cancer health effects.\nDiesel exhaust has been listed as a known carcinogen under California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act (Prop. 65) since 1990. Many components of diesel exhaust, such as benzene, arsenic, dioxins, and formaldehyde, are also known carcinogens in California. Other components, such as toluene and dioxins, are known reproductive toxicants\"\n\n\"Recent research has shown that a class of carcinogenic (cancer-causing) compounds known as tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) may be formed in flue-cured tobacco leaves during the curing process. These compounds are not found in green (uncured) tobacco\"\n\n\"The direct-fire curing systems currently in use in most U.S. curing barns are considered to be the major factor contributing to elevated levels of TSNAs in U.S. flue-cured tobacco. Further, there is no known fuel treatment or burner design that can eliminate these nitrogen compounds from combustion gases without the use of a heat exchanger (found in all indirect-fired systems). It is believed that reducing the levels of TSNAs in tobacco products would reduce some of the health concerns associated with tobacco use\"\n\n\n\"The tobacco industry is becoming increasingly disturbed by industries which are using smoking as a cover-up for their problems in complying with the Clean Air Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Tobacco executives have noted efforts by the oil industry, the automobile industry and others to hide their pollution behind a tobacco smoke screen.\n\nDemocrats, labor unions and environmental activists may also see this cover-up as a potential issue to be used against Republicans in 1976, labeling them as \"protectors of the polluters.\" Adding to their suspicion is foot dragging of the National Cancer Advisory Board in acting on environmental and occupational cancer, which some scientists and environmental activists regard as ignored and \"unindicted co-conspirators\" in the case against cancer.\nThe NCAB is much more vigorous in its almost single-minded persecution of smoking.\n\n\"Certain streams came to be named from the quantities of the substance found on the surface of the water, as \"Oil Creek' in Northwestern Pennsylvania, \"Old Greasy\" or Kanawha in West Virginia.

Hartnett's attorneys estimate that he was exposed for 42,960 hours during his time as a bus driver and shifter. Other in the case had more exposure, like mechanics Vincenzo Mancio and Joseph Ganz, who are now deceased from cancer and heart problems and are represented by family in the law suit.\n\nAt the end of his shift Emidio DeStefano, 71, drove his bus into the back entrance of a depot he worked at for 20 years at 126th Street near the East River. He and the others then had to walk the length of the massive structure, some three blocks, to the other side. It was a slow walk because he often had to squeeze between the buses parked cheek by jowl. \"There was no air whatsoever,\" he said. He said they complained to supervisors but nothing was ever changed.\n\n\"According to the most recent Environmental Protection Agency data, New York City has the dirtiest air in America. In the whole country, no city population has a greater risk of getting cancer from breathing air than residents of our five boroughs. \"\n\n\"History also plays a part. After WWII, General Motors bought up most of America's railways and destroyed them or left them unused, forcing interstate commerce to shift away from trains and become mostly dependent upon the trucking industry.\n\nGM admitted this in a document entitled \"The Truth About American Ground Transport,\" which was submitted to the U.S. Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly of the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate in April 1974.\n\nGM was convicted along with Standard Oil and Firestone for this conspiracy in 1949. This conspiracy led to more emissions from cars and trucks, especially in California where these oil and car companies battled against transportation alternatives not powered by petroleum. As a frightening result, all over the country, pollution became concentrated in high-traffic urban areas.\n\nIn 1963, a phenomenon called thermal inversion occurred in New York City's atmosphere. Warm air trapped cooler air below it. Pollutants were trapped in the lower layer and 405 people died, mainly from carbon monoxide poisoning. Inversion struck again in November 1966, with 168 fatalities.\n\n\"On Thursday, industry representatives, environmentalists and scientists spent the day debating the link between diesel exhaust and lung cancer and the implications for California's economy and public health.\"\n\"From truckers to farmers to manufacturers, industry leaders descended Thursday on the California Air Resources Board in an effort to stop the board from declaring diesel exhaust a potent cancer-causing danger to the public.\"\n\n\"Trucking companies and engine manufacturers worry that if the air board implicates diesel exhaust as a potent carcinogen, they could be held liable for paying massive damages for causing people's cancers. Even without an outright ban on diesel, the air board's decision would make it difficult to operate a wide variety of businesses that depend on the engines, from grocery stores to construction firms, industry officials say\"\n\n\"In April, the state's Scientific Review Panel concluded that diesels could be killing more than 14,000 Californians by causing 450 lung cancers among every 1 million people exposed to average concentrations over a lifetime. Based on that risk estimate, diesel exhaust ranks sixth in potency of 19 air pollutants now identified as hazardous.\n\nMore than 30 human health studies from around the world show a link between diesel exhaust and cancer\u2013more so than with any other substance reviewed by the state in 15 years, said John Froines, a leading environmental health specialist at UCLA who heads the Scientific Review Panel. In the studies, railroad crews and other workers regularly exposed to large doses of the fumes suffered 40% more lung cancer than average.\"\n\n\nDiesel\u2013the Dark Side of Industry\n\"For two days in a row, as he unloaded baggage from jets at Los Angeles International Airport, clouds of soot poured out of a malfunctioning diesel-powered loading machine. For 23 years Lewis worked for airlines, taking pride in hardly ever calling in sick. But now his head ached, his eyes burned and his nose ran. Coughs racked his body. Suddenly he could barely breathe.\n\nExamined by a doctor, Lewis was shocked to learn, according to court documents, that his airways were severely scarred. A specialist told him he was suffering the sudden onset of an unusual respiratory disease, an \"industrial asthma,\" caused by the intense bouts of diesel smoke exposure.\n\"An irreversible condition,\" the pulmonologist said, \"with a poor prognosis.\" The fumes had eaten away at the lining of his airways, leaving them so hypersensitive he had to live on oxygen 24 hours a day, confined to his home\"\n\n\"The danger is not just from the sort of sudden, extreme exposure that afflicted Lewis, but from everyday, lower doses as well. Exactly how much the public is endangered and how best to protect people from trucks and other machinery is now among the most contentious issues facing environmental officials.\"\n\n\"The 4 million Americans who operate diesel machines on the job face the most serious risks.\n\nTheir chances of dying from lung cancer rise 20% to 40% compared with the general population, according to a Health Effects Institute review of about 40 studies by epidemiologists\"\n\n\"At the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles\u2013massive operations that are filled with trucks, ships, trains and cranes\u2013workers breathe some of the most severe doses of diesel exhaust found anyplace in California.\"\n\"Studies show that truck cabs contain the same amount of carbon particles as the surrounding highway air. But because truckers spend more time on highways than the general population, they probably breathe more pollutants into their lungs.\n\nIn one federal study, truckers with more than 35 years on the job faced an 89% increase in lung cancer compared with the general public. The study controlled for both smoking and diet.\n\nA Harvard University study that tracked 55,000 railroad workers who died before 1980 found that their cancer rate increased with years of exposure\u2013those with more than 15 years on the job had a 72% greater rate of dying from lung cancer than the general population\"\n\n\n\"Traffic pollution causes genetic changes in the womb which increase a child's risk of developing asthma, research suggests.\nA study of umbilical cord blood from 56 children found \"reprogramming\" of a gene associated with exposure to compounds in traffic fumes.\"\n\n\"They also recorded the mothers' exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) - a by-product of combustion present in high levels in heavy-traffic areas - during their pregnancy with backpack air monitors.\nThe researchers found a significant association between chemical changes which control activation of the gene and high levels of maternal PAH exposure.\n\nAlthough the finding needs to be confirmed in larger studies, researchers say changes in the ACSL3 gene may be help early diagnosis of pollution-related asthma.\"\n\n\"We know that children living in polluted areas have a higher incidence of asthma but what we didn't know was it was affecting a gene\"\n\n\"We do know however that pollution triggers symptoms in two thirds of people with asthma, and many say that a reduction in air pollution would make the single biggest difference to their quality of life.\"\n\n\nAn Action on Smoking and Healthspecial investigationinto the threat of passive smoking to the U.K. workforce\n\"An estimated 12,000 U.K. nonsmokers die annually from secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure at home, at work, and in social venues.

{"text":"Carbon Monoxide: A Silent Danger in Your Home\n\nAlarm.org Offers Tips for Carbon Monoxide Detection\nIrving, Texas (June 22, 2012) \u2014 As a homeowner, you're concerned with the safety of your family and home. You've taken the necessary precautions: Installing an alarm system to keep intruders away, testing your smoke alarm to protect against fire, and putting safety locks on the cabinets to keep your little ones safe from potentially hazardous household cleaners. But what are you doing to protect your family from one of the biggest\u2014and deadliest\u2014dangers in your home?\nThat danger is known as carbon monoxide (CO), a colorless, tasteless and odorless gas that is undetectable by human senses. Carbon monoxide can emit from common household sources such as furnaces, fireplaces, space heaters, central heating systems, stoves that burn natural gas, and vehicles. While these products are designed to function safely, factors such as improper use,damage or faulty construction can cause a carbon monoxide leak.\nA carbon monoxide leak can become fatal in a matter of minutes. When a person inhales high levels of the poisonous gas, he or she may begin to experience symptoms including headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain and confusion.In fact, symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning often feel similar to the flu, which makes recognizing a leak even more difficult.So how do you protect your family from carbon monoxide? Alarm.org, a consumer resource for home security, recommends that you install carbon monoxide detectors in your home to alert you of unsafe gas levels. Place detectors near the ceiling on every level of your home and at least 15 feet away from gas-fueled appliances and dead-air spaces such as windows and doors. Make sure everyone in your home (including kids) knows what the detector sounds like. If your detector sounds, leave your home immediately. Once you are safely outside, call 911 and check everyone who was in the house for symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.\nIt is important that you regularly test your detectors and change the batteries twice a year. The life span of a detector can range anywhere from 2-7 years, so check the manual and replace detectors accordingly. For more information about carbon monoxide detectors, contact a trusted alarm company. You can find a company in your area by using a resource such as  An alarm company will be able to recommend safety measures and install detectors in your home.\nCarbon monoxide is a danger that is impossible to detect on your own, so let your alarm system and detectors help. After all, life protection is their one and only job."}

Because of the brittle nature of coal, coal dust can be created during mining, transportation, or by mechanically handling coal.\n\nLung and skin problems\n\nAccording to George Orwell, coal miners could develop characteristic tattoos owing to coal dust getting into wounds. This can also occur with substances like gunpowder.\n\nCoal dust in energy generation\n\nFor use in thermal power plants, coal is ground into dust using a device called a powdered coal mill. The resulting product, called powdered coal or pulverized coal, is then generally used in a fossil fuel power plant for electricity generation.\nPulverised coal is a significant dust explosion hazard, as large quantities are suspended in air for transfer from the mill to the power plant. Explosions have occurred when the flow drops and flames in the burning chamber pass back along the ductwork delivering fuel."}

The agreement also included a provision to reduce diesel air pollution from Montgomery County school buses.\n\nThe Center supported the ICC proposal and continues to support the project. The air monitoring requirement is a waste of money because the region is already required to monitor air quality. The ICC will help move traffic in the Washington, DC region more efficiently and that will reduce air pollution. Moreover, the ICC will help families spend more time together by reducing rush hour gridlock. In fact, the Washington Metropolitan Area needs an outer beltway. The Center supported the Woodrow Wilson Bridge replacement and the accompanying interchange improvements. Those improvements, along with the Mixing Bowl development, will go far in easing congestion in the region, thus improving air quality.\n\nWe applaud the agreement requiring Maryland to spend $1 million to install exhaust filters on 70 diesel school buses. Again, we wish the state has saved the $1 million to collect three years of data from a new air-quality monitor near the Beltway and Route 214 in Prince George's County. Although the results could determine how much people near highways are exposed to unhealthy particles and droplets of chemicals in vehicle emissions, such monitoring is already required. And the region has bad air days according to requirements under the Clean Air Act. The filters, which cost $15,000 each, trap about 95 percent of a bus's pollution. Since newer buses arrived with filters built in and some older buses have been retrofitted,about 60 percent of Montgomery's fleet now has the filters.\n\nThe $2 million is part of the ICC's $2.56 billion construction budget. The six-lane highway will connect the Interstate 270 corridor in Montgomery County with the Interstate 95 corridor in Laurel, in northwestern Prince George's County. (Wash Post, 1\/1"}

{"text":"Air Quality & Climate\n\nClimate and air quality are two imminent areas of environmental sciences, and they are associated closely through numerous complex physical and\nchemical processes. Air quality in New England is especially susceptible to variations in seasonal climate due to its extensive areal forest coverage,\ncomplex terrain features, and significant influx of air pollutants from major urban\/industrial centers in the eastern U.S. There is already strong evidence\nthat the length of the growing season is increasing in New England. Longer and hotter summers should not only have a major impact on biogenic emissions,\nbut also on air quality and the occurrence of O3 episodes. To provide an assessment of the quality of our present environment, it is imperative\nto identify the key mechanisms that control these processes to better understand the variability in climate and levels of persistent pollutants such as\nO3 and Hg\u00b0.\n\nDynamical processes on different spatial and temporal scales together shape air quality in New England. Atmospheric chemical composition at\nmid\u2013latitudes can be altered by interannual variability in large\u2013scale circulation patterns. For example, our recent studies found that\nthe enhanced mixing ratios of O3 in winter 2003, compared to winter 2002, was the result of strong meridional flows transporting abnormally\ncold and O3\u2013rich air masses from the Arctic troposphere to the northeastern U.S. In addition, synoptic southwesterly flow in summer\ncan transport high levels of pollutants including O3 from metropolitan areas in southern New England or even as far south as the Mid\u2013Atlantic States.\nOn a smaller scale, interdiurnal variability in atmospheric processes, such as the evolution of Canadian low pressure system and day\u2013to\u2013day\nmigration of high pressure over the North Atlantic Ocean, is non\u2013periodic, which is key to the occurrence of air pollution episodes and generation\nof outflow from North American Conceivably interdiurnal, intraseasonal, and interannual variability in meso\u2013 to hemispheric\u2013 scale dynamic\nprocesses have a profound impact on atmospheric chemistry in the northeast.\n\nNatural ecosystems are sensitive to climate change, and the resulting perturbation in vegetation will inevitably influence the exchange of trace\ngases (e.g., biogenic volatile organic compounds\u2014BVOC\u00eds) between soil, vegetation, and the atmosphere. As a result, year\u2013to\u2013year changes\nin climate variables such as temperature, moisture, and radiation during the growing season can influence BVOC emissions with subsequent effects on\nO3 photochemistry. It is thus critical to quantify climate change in the northeastern U.S. and its impact on biogenic emissions and subsequently\nO3 and its precursors. Such interdisciplinary research not only provides a quantitative assessment of present day climate and air quality,\nbut establishes a solid foundation for estimating future changes.\n\nRelated Projects\n\nAIRMAP\nAIRMAP is a UNH air quality and climate program unraveling fundamental\nchemistry-climate connections in the rural atmosphere of New England,\ndirectly downwind of major urban\/industrialized emissions."}

Also short term exposure to air pollutants alone could affect development of respiratory while long term exposure has greater impact when combined with tobacco smokeThe question whether trees reduce or add to urban pollution is frequently debated with the answer seeming to be that in a highly polluted atmosphere, some coniferous trees add aromatic gases to the mix. Today we review an interesting article that suggests that foliage (not trees) will absorb pollution through their plant surface which is more effective than the hard surfaces that make up street canyons \u2013 with reductions of 40-60% in terms of the concentrations of NO2 and PM.\n\nToday we review research aimed at deducing how much particulate pollution exists below clouds, as observed by satellites which normally have their air quality sensors blocked by the opaqueness of the clouds. The technique is based on comparing the number of droplets observed in a region which does not have particulates with one that does and then accounting for the difference. If applied and found successful, this would overcome one of the main difficulties in monitoring particulates near the ground from space. a report concerned with the more timely reporting, processing and distribution of air quality data in Europe via an E-Reporting system to come online on January 1, 2014.

What is most interesting to this observer who comes from a country with the same challenges involved in different (provincial) jurisdictions where similar agreements and coordination is needed to ensure timely delivery of air quality information and warnings., we review research that looked at the increased risk of short term exposure to slightly higher levels of air pollution (i.e. \"moderate\" compared to \"good\"), measured at hourly intervals. Results indicated that the onset of stroke occurs within 12-14 hours and that the most hazardous type of pollution (NO2 and PM2.5)comes from vehicles and traffic.\n\nTo see Key Quotes and Links to key reports about this post, click HERE\n\nToday, we review a study that assesses the mortality health risk for native born Canadians from long term exposure to fine particulate matter which is higher in the Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto-Windsor corridor than elsewhere in the country.

Beijing is a large city both in terms of population (19,612,368 in 2010) and area (16,801 km2) so that the 24 monitors to monitor PM10 and PM2.5 in future are about the same ratio one sees in Canada and the USA. Even this is far from the monitor density needed to adequately estimate roadside emissions as, for example, in the UK where over 200 local authorities have declared over 500 Air Quality Management Areas(AQMA).

A more detailed analysis of the added effect of meteorology, summarized in the article under review, shows that favourable winds and well-timed rainfall had at least as much to do with the results.

Not surprisingly, those with the least pollution are small cities located some distance from industry in western Canada and USA and in southeast Australia, while the most polluted are in developing industrialized countries in Asia and Central America. The measure used for this comparison is particulate matter which comes from a number of sources in industry and from (diesel) vehicle emissions. IMHO, a better measure in cities afflicted with traffic air pollution might be nitrogen and carbon oxides (NO2 and CO2).\n\nThe focus today is on the results of an investigation into eight sources of particulate matter as they impact human health and which ones have the greatest impact. As pointed out, previous research on this topic have been challenged on the second question because the sources tend to be cross-correlated on effect and hard to isolate. Despite this, the article points to sulphur particulates from traffic diesel fuel and minerals from brake wear and road dust as the main culprits.\n\nTo see Key Quotes and Links to key reports about this post, click HERE\n\nThe focus today is on research into the impacts of long term exposure to emissions and noise from heavy traffic (greater than 22,000 vehicles\/day) on blood pressure.

When tested on cultures of human cells, WSPM also caused more damage to the genetic material, DNA; more inflammation; and had greater activity in turning on genes in ways linked to disease\"\n\nThe aging of society in many countries has also resulted in an increase in the number of sufferers from dementia and alzheimers disease. The journal article under review today confirms an association between particulate matter emitted by vehicles in traffic and cognitive thinking ability in older men, although the same association has already been shown with children and pets. This is yet another reason to limit exposure to traffic-related pollution and to limit or reduce traffic volume.\n\nKey Quotes\n\"A doubling of exposure to black carbon \u2014 a marker for traffic pollution \u2014 was associated with a 30% greater chance of having a low score on a screening test for dementia\"\n\n\"This is the first study to find an association between traffic-related air pollution and cognition in older men, and only the second to consider the relationship in older adults,\"\n\n\"Children and dogs residing in a highly polluted city were also more likely to exhibit white matter hyperintensities in the prefrontal cortex than those residing in a city with lower levels\"\n\n\"if traffic-related air pollution is causally related to cognitive impairment in older adults, implementation of interventions to reduce exposure, including establishment of more stringent emissions standards, would be expected to have substantial benefits,\"\n\n\"They noted that traffic pollution could affect the central nervous system either directly or indirectly.\"\n\n1) \"What are the benefits expressed as an effect on mortality of a sustained reduction in annual average air pollution across the UK by a small fixed amount ?\n\nAnswer: A policy which aimed to reduce the annual average concentration of PM2.5 by 1 \u00b5g\/m 3 would result in a saving of approximately 4 million life years or an increase in life expectancy of 20 days in people born in 2008.\"\n\n2) \"If anthropogenic air pollution in 2008 were to be removed and pollution sustained at low non-anthropogenic levels, what would be the benefits in terms of effects on mortality?\n\nAnswer: The current (2008) burden of anthropogenic particulate matter air pollution is, with some simplifying assumptions, an effect on mortality in 2008 equivalent to nearly 29,000 deaths in the UK at typical ages and an associated loss of total population life of 340,000 life-years.

The new probe described in the article under review today seems to provide a reliable way of monitoring particulates directly at source in the flue. This in turn suggests a potential way of regulating \"low emission\" wood stoves in the future.\n\nKey Quotes:\n\n\"When pellets, logs or briquettes are burnt, fine dust particles that are hazardous to health are released into the atmosphere.\"\n\n\"[in Germany]Wood use by private individuals has gone up by 60 to 80 per cent since the year 2000..fine dust particles reduce average life expectancy in Germany by approximately ten months.\"\n\n\"To date there is no validated method for measuring the dust content in flue gases.

The probe draws off some of the flue gases, which are diluted with pre-treated air at the tip of the probe and then cooled in a conditioning unit. The conditioned flue gases are subsequently fed through two optoelectronic sensors which use different measuring techniques.. An algorithm combines the electrical signals from both these sensors to produce a definitive reading\"\n\n\"these results confirm the findings from several investigations worldwide: in large cities of industrialized countries, a sizeable proportion of several adverse health effects, including mortality, is due to bad air quality\"\n\n\"In Italy the characteristics of the monitoring stations are indicated by a law that defines four main types, based only on qualitative criteria:\n\nurban background station;\n\nhigh density population station;\n\nhigh traffic station;\n\nsuburban photochemical\"\n\n\"Each city has a different number of stations (ranging from 7 in Bologna and Palermo to 19 in Genoa)\n\n\"Among people older than 30, 4.7% of all deaths are attributable to PM10 concentrations in excess of 30 ug\/m3.

Radon is a naturally occurring, invisible, odorless, tasteless gas that is dispersed in outdoor air, but which can reach harmful levels when trapped in homes and buildings. Scientists have long been concerned about the health risks of radon, and there is overwhelming proof that exposure to elevated levels of radon causes lung cancer in humans.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that radon is responsible for more than 20,000 lung cancer deaths per year. Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer among non-smokers and the second leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. after smoking. People often don't even realize that their homes are at risk but South Central Kentucky has some of the highest radon rates in the world.\n\nFortunately, testing homes for radon is simple and inexpensive. Radon test kits can be purchased at local hardware and home improvement stores or can be picked up at your local health department at no cost. Radon problems can be fixed by qualified contractors for a cost similar to that of many common home repairs such as painting or having a new water heater installed (about $500 to $2500)."}

{"text":"Air pollution linked to premature births\n\nAir pollution poses a risk to pregnant women and their babies, according to a study published recently in the science journal, Environmental Health. Traffic-generated air pollutants, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), are linked to a 30-percent increase in premature births.\n\nFor nearly two years investigators looked at 100,000 births that occurred within a five mile radius of air quality monitoring stations in Los Angeles, California. Researchers compared exposure to specific air pollutants and length of gestation, making adjustments for variables such as maternal age, ethnicity, education and whether mothers had given birth before.\n\nAir quality information was derived from three separate sources, and included data regarding concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and fine particulate matter.\n\nSome of the pollutants were specific to particular areas, due to industry and urbanization. Overall exposure to widespread pollutants, such as PAH, however, was clearly linked to a 30 percent increase in the risk of premature birth.\n\nExposure to other toxins, such as benzene, and fine particulates from diesel engines, was linked to a 10-percent increased risk. Exposure to ammonium nitrate particles was associated with a 21-percent increased risk of premature birth.\n\nInvestigators noted that local weather played a role in exposure, as did location. Women living in coastal areas, where winds presumably help disperse air pollution, experienced lower risks than women in urban areas.\n\n\"Air pollution is known to be associated with low birth weight and premature birth. Our results show that traffic-related PAH are of special concern as pollutants, and that PAH sources besides traffic contributed to premature birth,\" said Dr Beate Ritz.\n\n\"The increase in premature birth risk due to ammonium nitrate particles suggests secondary pollutants are also negatively impacting the health of unborn babies. To reduce the effects of these pollutants on public health, it is important that accurate modeling of local and regional spatial and temporal air pollution be incorporated into pollution policies.\"\n\nPremature delivery (preterm birth) is often associated with low birth weight of the baby.

Whatever the actual level of pollution we decide to permit, wouldn't a fee-based system be the most efficient and fair way to achieve that goal?\n\nCarol Browner of the Environmental Protection Agency responds:\n\nAll Americans have an interest in clean air and water, and everyone should and does share in deciding what levels of pollution are acceptable. Through our representatives in Congress, everyone's interests are taken into account and are reflected in the laws such as the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.\n\nThe Clean Air Act, for example, requires that the EPA review the national ambient air quality standards every five years to ensure that they are based on the latest scientific knowledge. Based on such knowledge, the Act requires that these standards, such as the standards for ozone and particulate matter, protect public health with an adequate margin of safety, as well as protect the environment from adverse effects. The Act further requires that an independent science advisory committee, comprised of experts in various fields, review the science and the standards, and provide their advice and recommendations to me as to whether any changes are appropriate to ensure the protections required by the Act. This extensive scientific review process is open to the public, and provides an opportunity for all interested parties to have input into this decision making process. Further, once I propose a decision based on the science and the advice that I receive through this scientific review process, I encourage the public to comment on the proposal so that a full range of views can be taken into account in making a final decision.\n\nIn the case of the ozone and particulate matter national ambient air quality standards, the decision to strengthen these standards was based on hundreds of peer reviewed scientific studies, the advice and recommendations of my scientific advisors, and consideration of more than 55,000 comments from the public. I believe that these decisions, and the process that we use to reach these decisions, reflect the interests of the public in deciding upon appropriate heath standards, both through direct comments and indirectly through the law passed by Congress which guides our actions. This scientifically sound and fair approach helps achieve the best public health and the environmental protection for all Americans.\n\nFee-based systems, where companies or individuals are charged according to how much they pollute, are one of many economic tools that states can choose to reduce air pollution. Emission trading systems, another market-based approach, have significantly reduced sulfur dioxide emissions which cause acid rain.

{"text":"Lung Center\n\nSpraying Latex Paint\n\n05\/03\/2010\n\nQuestion:\n\nHi, over the last couple weekends I was spray painting latex paint onto doors. Most of the time I wore a N95 paper mask, but there may have been an hour or so when I was outside spraying that I didn`t. I know I had some spray in my face (windy day) and I was concerned about getting particles in my lungs. I read the warning label after doing this and of course found that the paint contains crystaline silica which can cause cancer. They warn to stay out of the mist and also not to sand, or abrade the material. I was curious if I should be concerned about this level of exposure, or if this is generally a long-term exposure issue? The paint can says it is long-term exposure, but I just wanted a second opinnion. I haven`t had any trouble breathing or anything since I did this. I was wondering if I should go and be checked out.\n\nThanks!\n\n******* One last question regarding the question about spraying latex paint.....they also list Zinc on the warning label. I wouldn`t assume this is an inhalation hazard or a delayed type of problem like crysaline silica can be. Would I be correct and assume my short-term exposure shouldn`t be an issue? What would the issue with Zinc be...would it be long-term exposure for the guys who work in it everyday?\n\n********** One last thing to mention, the Zinc warning was for Zinc Oxide (in latex paint) as I understand it. I did talk with a poison control center and they didn`t feel I was at any risk for either Zinc Oxide, or Crystaline Silica because the exposure was so low....They indicated that the Zinc oxide would have been an acute issue if I had one...not a long-term risk. Is this accurate and should I have any concern here?\n\nThanks so much!\n\nAnswer:\n\nI think the poison control center is correct on these questions. The silica exposure is minimal.\n\nYou are correct that the greatest risks from any environmental agents are to those who work with them 8 hours per day, 5 or 6 days per week for 30 to 40 years. Lung cancer is a risk from chronic silica exposure, but the biggest issue is silicosis, which causes a stiffening of the lung, making it difficult to breathe. This usually takes 20 to 30 years to develop.\n\nAs for the zinc oxide, the harmful effects of breathing it typically are associated with fumes from welding and brazing. It is recommended not to weld galvanized steel for example, which can cause neurological problems. If you have no symptoms, it is unlikely you have anything to worry about. Your instincts were good in using the mask, and it sounds like in the future you will use the mask until you finish the job"}

According to The Associated Press, board members said they intend to develop tougher regulations for Salt Lake City and much of the northern Utah urban sector.\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrators had set December 14, 2012, as the deadline for Utah leaders to establish up-to-date air pollution standards. However, Utah officials said they will miss the deadline, as these representatives will have more time to develop stricter policies for oil refineries and other industrial facilities.\n\n\"It's better to have the right plan late than the wrong plan on time,\" Bruce Bird, director of the Utah Division of Air Quality, told the news source.\n\nRichard Mylott, an EPA spokesperson, noted that agency officials expect Utah leaders to work diligently to institute new air pollution regulations.\n\nA quality air purifier like the Airgle\u00ae PurePal\u00ae Plus AG850 Air Purifier absorbs many volatile compounds, including benzene, toulene and xylene. This air purifier eliminates potentially dangerous odors from chemicals, gases and hazardous molecular pollutants.\n\nThis entry was posted in Pollution on December 14, 2012 by FreshAirPro.\n\nResearchers at the Harvard School of Public Health recently discovered a significant connection between the declining air pollution rates in the United States and the rising average life expectancy among the country's citizens. According to News-Medical, the research team found that there have been substantial reductions in air pollution over the past 10 years, which have helped improve life expectancy figures in many areas. However, Andrew Correia, a researcher with the Harvard School of Public Health, cautions that optimum air quality levels have not yet been reached.\n\n\"The U.S. population as a whole is exposed to much lower levels of air pollution than 30 years ago...it appears that further reductions in air pollution levels would continue to benefit public health,\" Correia told the news source.\n\nCorreia and other researchers collected data between 2000 and 2007 for their evaluation. Group members calculated the mean life expectancy change during this time frame in 545 U.S. counties, and also considered potential variables such as the number of residents who smoked and the socioeconomic status of citizens in these regions.\n\nThe Airgle\u00ae PurePal\u00ae MultiGas AG950 Air Purifier is useful for people who want an efficient molecular and particle filtration system. This air purifier includes 100 percent pressure-sealed technology with no air bypass to ensure that no bioburdens, particulates or VOCs can escape.\n\nThis entry was posted in Pollution on December 12, 2012 by FreshAirPro.\n\nParents and teachers at Woodriver Elementary School in Alaska's Fairbanks North Star Borough are trying to eliminate air pollution from the area. According to the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, the elementary school was severely hit by wintertime smoke, and local parents and educators have formed a committee to help combat air quality issues.\n\nA recently approved proposal prevents officials in the borough from enforcing air pollution regulations on home heating devices. However, parents and teachers are reaching out to state administrators to help relieve air pollution problems that have been shown to cause health problems.\n\n\"As the parents, once we started looking into it more it was really concerning,\" local parent Carrie Dershin told the news source. \"Seeing the levels and seeing how extremely poor it was for all the children was really concerning.\"\n\nThe Airgle\u00ae PurePal\u00ae Plus AG850 Air Purifier features enhanced technology for chemical, microbe, odor and particle filtration.

According to the Houston Chronicle, the agency approved revised regulations for the Lone Star State's power plants and refineries on November 30, 2012.\n\nEPA officials noted that the public plays a role in the permit-approval process, and residents can offer input before a company receives a state-issued permit. Ron Curry, a local administrator with the EPA, said that public participation is essential for the agency's Clean Air Act to be successful. Amendments from this regulation are designed to help people avoid the dangers of air pollution, and under the recently accepted Texas legislation, agency representatives said they hope state residents will have easier access to documents and other information related to pending permits.\n\nWith the Airgle\u00ae PurePal\u00ae MultiGas AG950 Air Purifier, a company that needs to handle air-pollution concerns can effectively safeguard its team members from these problems. This air purifier features 15 pounds of premium-grade activated carbon and a medical-grade cHEPA filter that is more than 99.991 percent efficient, and it performs at over 320 CADR while also meeting ENERGY STAR requirements.\n\nThis entry was posted in Pollution on December 3, 2012 by FreshAirPro.\n\nFor the first time ever, a no-burn alert order has been issued for Southland. A majority of the Los Angeles population is being asked to not light wood-burning fireplaces or open fire pits. The Los Angeles Times reports that the intent of the restriction is to reduce the levels of air pollution surrounding the city.\n\nThe new program was adopted by the South Coast Air Quality Management District and applies to residents in West Hollywood, Burbank, the downtown area and many in the eastern portion of the San Fernando Valley. Violating the order comes with a $50 fine for first-time offenders.\n\n\"Over 1 million homes actively use fireplaces to burn wood in Los Angeles,'' Sam Atwood, an agency spokesman at the South Coast Air Quality Management District, told the news source. \"That results in four times the particulate pollution created by all of the power plants in the basin.\"\n\nHomeowners looking to reduce the presence of fine particulate matter within their house regardless of what time of year it is can purchase an IQAir HealthPro Plus Air. The medical-grade quality unit is intended to limit potential respiratory aggravators.\n\nThis entry was posted in Pollution on November 30, 2012 by FreshAirPro.\n\nAmericans concerned about the presence of air pollution in their community can monitor the posted concentrations of the six most common pollutants in the United Stated. The Environmental Protection Agency tracks levels of ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and lead.\n\nThe Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for these six pollutants because they can be harmful to people's health and the environment and even cause property damage. These pollutants are tracked in two ways: by air concentration levels based on actual measurements of pollutant concentration in outside air at selected monitoring sites and by emission estimates made by experienced engineers and scientists.\n\nThe limits based on human health requirements are referred to as primary standards. Another set of regulated levels, called secondary standards, is intended to prevent environmental and property damage.\n\nBy investing in a home air purifier, a person can further limit the presence of common air pollutants in his or her house. The IQAir HealthPro Plus Air Purifier can improve air quality within a home and help everyone remain safe and healthy.\n\nThis entry was posted in Pollution on November 29, 2012 by FreshAirPro."}

{"text":"Study suggests houseplants help clean office air\n\nThat nice plant your pod mate has on her desk? It does more than make the office look better.\n\nA research team from Pennsylvania State University showed that three common houseplants reduce ozone concentrations, which could make the workplace healthier. What's more, the plants are cheap and easy to care for.\n\nOzone, the main component of air pollution, or smog, is a highly reactive, colorless gas formed when oxygen reacts with other chemicals. Although ozone pollution is most often associated with outdoor air, the gas also infiltrates indoor environments like homes and offices. Ozone can be released by ordinary copy machines, laser printers, ultraviolet lights, and some electrostatic air purification systems, all of which contribute to increased indoor ozone levels. Topping the extensive list of toxic effects of ozone on humans are pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, inflammation, and reduction of lung function.\n\nBecause people in industrialized countries spend as much of 80% to 90% of their time indoors, indoor air pollution has been ranked as one of the world's greatest public health risks.\n\nThe United Nations Development Program estimated (1998) that more than two million people die each year due to the presence of toxic indoor air, while other studies estimate that 14 times as many deaths occur globally from poor indoor air quality compared with outdoor air pollution."}
{"text":"Dexter Filkins\n\nOxygen deficiency is an important factor in the cause of heart failures and strokes. These medical conditions frequently occur in many scenarios where oxygen does not reach the cells and tissues of heart or brain. Even in a small scale, oxygen deficiency can cause nausea, breathing trouble, irrational behavior and emotional imbalances, fatigue and weakness etc. While heart and brain activity stops when the oxygen concentration falls below 5%, the nausea and fatigue are caused when oxygen concentration decreases even 2-5% from the normally required amount of 20%.\n\nOxygen deficiency normally occurs at high altitudes, confined spaces, especially those without proper air circulation. Today, many industries and workplaces pose many a possible risky scenarios and locations where oxygen deficiency can occur easily and within a short period of time. Though the industries and factories may be built over a large area and most probably overlooking an open area or water body, there are many nooks and corners in each of those industries. More than a few of those areas will require employees and laborers to visit them or stay inside them for prolonged periods to perform tasks.\n\nConfined spaces that have no proper means for the entry or exit of individuals and those which do not have proper means for ventilation of air that is circulating inside are prime locations for oxygen deficiency to occur. Some commonly encountered confined spaces are manholes and sewer lines, silos, vats, reactors, vessels and boilers. When an individual enters a confined space with improper ventilation and no avenue for air circulation, the oxygen levels in the air are depleted very soon, since the individual's respiration continues to occur. However, the individual will immediately feel the effects of depleted oxygen concentrations as soon as it drops below the normal level. Some times, a Portable Oxygen Concentrator can be used to correct this situation.\n\nAnother scenario or location for the prevalence of oxygen deficiency is near exhausts, especially those of toxic gases. Industrial exhausts, apart from polluting the environment, contain many gases that will easily displace the oxygen in the air. When a large volume of exhaust or toxic gases are suddenly released in an area with workers inside or if individual workers enter an area that is filled with exhausts, it can result in immediate oxygen deficiency if not dispensed with soon and the people evacuated. To avoid such incidents, it is essential to strictly adhere to the guidelines issued by federal agencies like OSHA and NIOSH."}
{"text":"Just by sitting there reading this story, you help cancel out some of the ozone in the air.\n\nTHE GIST\n\nSubstances in our skin oil remove ozone from the air in indoor environments.\n\nFlakes of skin are major components of indoor dust.\n\nOzone is a major component of smog, and exposure to it has been linked with a greater risk of lung irritation, asthma, heart attacks and death.\n\nWe shed skin constantly -- each of us replacing our outer layer of skin every two to four weeks -- and all of those skin flakes may help reduce levels of certain pollutants in indoor environments.\n\nSubstances in human skin oil are significant components of indoor dust, a new study found. And those substances are known to remove ozone from the atmosphere. Just by sitting there, in other words, you help cancel out some of the ozone in the room.\n\nBut floating flakes of skin might also do harm. Byproducts form as skin substances interact with ozone. Scientists don't yet know what the effects of those reactions might be.\n\n\"These results are a reminder that humans leave their skin flakes in the rooms they occupy,\" said lead researcher Charles Weschler, a chemist at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.\n\n\"What one person sheds may be an allergy trigger or source of harmful microbes for another occupant,\" he added. \"Keeping our indoor environments clean remains as important in 2011 as our grandparents told us two generations ago.\"\n\nOzone is a major component of smog, and exposure to it has been linked with a greater risk of lung irritation, asthma, heart attacks and death. Removing ozone from the environment, on the other hand, can reduce those risks and scientists have long wondered how human skin might help.\n\nOzone is quick to react with a few ingredients in human skin oils, including certain fatty acids and especially a substance called squalene. Previous research has shown that the simple presence of humans can reduce ozone levels in indoor situations.\n\nA simulation study, for example, found a plume in a region around the body where ozone levels were lower compared to other areas because of reactions with skin oil, said Glenn Morrison, an environmental engineer at the Missouri University of Science & Technology in Rolla, who led that work.\n\nIn another study published several years ago, Weschler and colleagues used simulated airplane cabins to show that the skin of passengers works like a sponge to remove a large portion of the ozone from aircraft environments. But the study also found that these chemical reactions produce byproducts with unknown and possibly harmful effects on health.\n\nFor the new study, Weschler's group looked at data collected as part of an ongoing project in Denmark that is investigating potential links between indoor environments and children's health problems, especially allergies and asthma. In particular, they focused on dust samples collected from the bedrooms of 500 kids, ages three to five, and from 151 daycare centers that those children attended.\n\nAlmost every sample contained large proportions of squalene and cholesterol, the researchers reported in Environmental Science & Technology, suggesting that human skin flakes make up much of the dust that settles on indoor surfaces.\n\nAnd while skin cells contain more squalene than cholesterol, the researchers found the opposite ratio in dust. That might be because cooking and other activities also release cholesterol into the environment. It could also be because ozone in the buildings is sucking up squalene. This was the first study to look at skin-derived substances in indoor dust.\n\nThe next question, Morrison said, is whether chemical reactions between skin and ozone make air quality better or worse inside buildings. Removing ozone should be a good thing. But byproducts produced by ozone-skin reactions are known to be strong lung irritants.\n\nFor now, along with previous work, the new findings are \"really revealing how the human body is a big part of influencing our environment,\" Morrison said. \"This is a pretty important outcome if you are trying to understand ozone exposure and other things, because we're part of the equation and we've basically been ignored.\""}

It suggests that fine air particulate matter - composed of particles that are 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller, thought to be sufficiently small that if inhaled they can deposit deep in the lung and possibly the brain - may be an important environmental risk factor for reduced cognitive function.\n\nThe study sample included 14,793 white, black, and Hispanic men and women aged 50 and older who participated in the 2004 Health and Retirement Study (a nationally representative survey of older adults).\n\nIndividual data were linked with data on 2004 annual average levels of fine air particulate matter from the Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality System monitors across the country.

The mine was placed on the very first list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the serious threat of deterioration of the historic salt carvings within the mine.\n\nThe salt carvings were created over many centuries by the miners and other sculptors, and represent an impressive body of art works within the hundreds of kilometers of mine passages.\n\n(Left) The Kinga Chapel, carved entirely of salt, including the altar (far end), floor tiles, and chandeliers. This area is still in excellent condition.\n\n(Right) A badly deteriorated salt statue in St. Anthony's Chapel. The project goal is to prevent other artworks in the mine from being similarly affected by water vapor.\n\nThe deterioration of the salt carvings is due to attack by water, much of which is transported through the air. Salt develops a liquid film on its surface and begins to dissolve when the relative humidity of the surrounding air reaches approximately 75%.\n\nPotential sources of water vapor in the mine include moisture from the forced ventilation system, penetration of ground water, water sources elsewhere in the mine, and even the breath of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who tour the mine each year. Protection of the mine and its artifacts could require different strategies, depending on the moisture source.\n\nIt is the first site ever to be removed from the endangered list, thanks in part to the efforts of ARL scientists.\n\nUnder a program funded by the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund II, under the auspices of the U.S.-Polish Joint Commission, with additional (later) assistance from the World Heritage Center (under the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, UNESCO), a study was carried out within the threatened portion of the Wieliczka Salt Mine to determine the likely source or sources of moisture, and to make recommendations to reduce or eliminate the threat.

These instruments remained in place for a full year to assess the daily and seasonal variability of the data, and were operated by the Polish team. The U.S. and Polish teams then worked together to evaluate the information and prepare a report and recommendations for the mine authorities, so that remedial measures (mainly dehumidification of the entering air stream) could be adopted.\n\nA U.S. specialist volunteered to design a huge dehumidification system for the mine, and to develop cost estimates for the equipment. The hardware was purchased under a variety of funding arrangements and installed in the mine's ventilation system. The dehumidification system became operational in the spring of 1998 and ran throughout the summer season. Conditions in the mine were remarkably improved from previous years; a member of the Polish scientific team monitored instruments installed in key areas to provide quantitative data.\n\nAlthough the dehumidification system is not yet operating exactly as desired, conditions in all mine areas but one have become safe for the sculptures. \"Tuning\" of the dehumidification system is planned and is expected to completely solve the mine's moisture problem.

{"text":"International Air Quality Advisory Board\n\nSPECIAL REPORT ON\nTRANSBOUNDARY AIR QUALITY ISSUES\n\nNovember 1998\n\n3. CONTINENTAL ISSUES: PERSISTENT TOXIC SUBSTANCES\n\n3.1 Quantification, Effects, Challenges, and the Grasshopper Effect\n\nAcross the North American continent, hundreds of hazardous pollutants are emitted into the\natmosphere daily from many different sources. These include motor vehicles, oil and gas\ncombustion, metallurgical industries, chemical production and manufacturing, gasoline\nproduction and distribution, and solvent use. Many hazardous pollutants have been found as\ncontaminants in surface water, sediment, drinking water, and food. The air pathway and\natmospheric deposition have increasingly been identified as factors in these occurences. Most of\nthe pollutants only contribute to local problems and are not transported long distances. One\nsubset of these hazardous pollutants, however, is a group known as persistent toxic substances.\nPTSs tend to volatilize and move through the atmosphere, frequently crossing boundaries before\nthey are deposited. Hence, they have become a cause for continental and global concern.\n\nBecause PTSs tend to undergo biomagnification and bioaccumulation, their impact is greatest on\nanimals at the top of the food web: predatory birds, fish, and mammals, including humans.\nExposure to PTSs seldom results in acute symptoms or death, but it can impair reproductive\ncapabilities and reduce resistance to disease. Studies of the chronic effects of exposure, however,\nare very difficult to conduct. For example, epidemiological studies are often impeded by the long\nlatency period (decades in some cases) from the time of exposure until the onset of effects.\n\nOnce PTSs have been emitted into the atmosphere, their ultimate destination depends in part on\ntheir chemical and physical characteristics and in part on prevailing meteorological conditions.\nMost PTSs remain in the atmosphere for several hours to a few days -- long enough to cross into\nneighboring states, provinces, or countries. In addition, because some of these compounds are\nsemi-volatile, they can evaporate and become airborne early in the day, and condense and deposit\nonto soil, vegetation or water later in the day. Some also show a similar seasonal cycle. This\nprocess of recycling through the atmosphere is known as the \"grasshopper effect.\" Although there\nare considerable uncertainties that prevent exact quantification of transport, it is generally agreed\nthat the \"atmospheric region of influence\" is very large.\n\nThere is considerable evidence of the long-range transport of PTSs and of their bioaccumulation\nin animals and humans in different parts of North America, including remote areas of the Arctic\nwhere no local sources exist. There are, however, major uncertainties regarding the source\nregions and magnitude of PTS emissions, and the rate of transport through the atmosphere.\nAlthough quantities in the atmosphere are often below detection, there is evidence that they\nnevertheless contribute significantly to bioaccumulation in fish, birds, and mammals.\n\nResiduals from past uses of these PTSs remain in the environment. Contaminated soils and\nsediments abound in many areas; leachate and volatiles from landfills often contain these\ncompounds. These are sources that are difficult to identify and quantify with any known\naccuracy. As an example, for more than a decade now, Lake Ontario has been acting as a net\nsource of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that are degassing out of the lake at a rate that\ncurrently exceeds inputs.\n\nEmissions from sources outside the continent also contribute to the accumulation of PTSs in\nNorth America, and vice versa. The transport of PTSs from outside North America to regions\nsuch as the Arctic is well documented. Figure 3-1 (Brown Snow), shows the pathway through\nwhich particles and persistent organic pollutants from the former Soviet Union are transported to\nthe Arctic. To define the air pollution source\u00adreceptor relationship between North America and\nother continents and regions, however, considerably more data are needed.\n\nThe major PTSs and the key issues associated with them are briefly described below.\n\n3.2 PCBs and PICs\n\nPCBs are a group of chemicals that were introduced in 1929 and manufactured in developed\ncountries until the late 1970s. (Some production apparently continues in parts of the former\nSoviet Union.) Because PCBs are chemically stable and heat resistant, they were used worldwide\nas electrical transformer and capacitor oils, hydraulic and heat exchange fluids, lubricating and\ncutting oils, and plasticizers in joint sealants. While their use is currently banned in all developed\ncountries, substantial amounts of PCBs still remain in large capacitors and transformers.\n\nThere is little information about current use and disposal of PCBs. Improper disposal in the past\nhas resulted in a large number of sites that contain PCB-contaminated sediments and soils. These\nsites are also suspected to be significant sources of atmospheric emissions, although the\nmagnitude and extent of these emissions are not known.\n\nSeveral \"products of incomplete combustion\" (PICs) -- including polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) and other polycyclic compounds containing oxygen and nitrogen -- are\npersistent in the environment. The PICs of most concern are dioxins (PCDDs) and furans\n(PCDFs), a group of chlorinated chemicals that are toxic to life forms in minute quantities. Dioxins and\nfurans can enter the environment in many ways. Waste incinerators that are not equipped with\nefficient flue-gas cleaning systems are known to be one of the most significant sources. Wood-burning stoves and the burning of leaded automotive fuel also add to loadings in the atmosphere.\nDioxins and furans also enter the environment as trace byproducts of industrial processes,\nincluding processes used in metallurgical industries. Pulp and paper mills using elemental\nchlorine in their bleaching process often release water contaminated with dioxins. Traces of these\ncontaminants have also been found in chlorophenoxy acid herbicides (e.g. Agent Orange), in\nchlorophenol wood preservatives, and in PCB mixtures (mainly furans). Hexachlorobenzene\n(HCB) is another trace byproduct in the production of chlorine gas and chlorinated compounds,\nincluding several pesticides. HCB is also emitted to the atmosphere by waste incineration and\nmetallurgical processes.\n\nMany substances used as flame retardants have chemical properties that are similar to PCBs.\nPolybrominated diphenyl ethers can leach out of electrical equipment, building materials, car\ninteriors, and textiles treated with flame retardant to contaminate the environment. Knowledge of\nthe toxicity of brominated flame retardants is very limited.\n\n3.3 Pesticides\n\nMany PTSs are pesticides -- organic compounds with several chlorine atoms designed to be toxic\nto their target organisms. Most affect the nervous system and the liver; several interfere with\nreproduction. Although most industrialized countries have eliminated or restricted the use of\nfirst-generation pesticides over the last two decades, much of the developing world still uses them\nfor public health and pest control purposes. Of primary concern are DDT, toxaphene, chlordane,\nmirex, aldrin, dieldrin, and hexachlorocyclohexanes.\n\n3.4 Metals\n\nMetals occur naturally in the environment as part of the earth's crust. They are emitted into the\nair and water through both natural and anthropogenic processes. The heavy metals of primary\nconcern are mercury, cadmium, and lead. These three metals can have discernable toxic effects to\nlife forms although their levels in the atmosphere are only moderately above background\nconcentrations.\n\nMercury also occurs naturally as elemental mercury and in organic and inorganic compounds.\nMuch of the mercury in the environment is strongly bonded to sediment and organic matter,\nmaking it unavailable to organisms. Microorganisms, however, can convert inorganic mercury\ninto methyl mercury, a fat-soluble molecule that easily passes through cell membranes,\naccumulates in animals, and biomagnifies in the food web. The processes controlling methylation\nand bioaccumulation are poorly understood. Because mercury is a nerve toxin, there are health\nconcerns about its effect on the brain, as well as damage to the reproductive, digestive, and\nsensory systems. Plants can also be sensitive to mercury, particularly at high concentrations,\nwhich can lead to reduced growth.\n\nTwo primary anthropogenic sources of mercury are fossil fuel combustion (particularly coal) and\nwaste incineration. Other sources include the chlor-alkali industry and non-ferrous metals\nproduction. Mercury is commonly used in thermometers, barometers, dental fillings, batteries,\nswitches and fluorescent lamps, and is thus present in waste containing these items.\n\nCadmium is toxic to most forms of life. It can be taken up directly from water, and to some\nextent from air and food, and has a tendency to bioaccumulate in both plants and animals. Kidney\ndamage, decalcification of the skeleton, and emphysema are the serious chronic effects of high\ncadmium exposure, but these are encountered only in some occupational settings. Cadmium is a\nbyproduct in the pyrometallurgical production of zinc, which is the leading anthropogenic source\nof cadmium to the environment. Cadmium is also a byproduct in the production of lead. Other\nmajor sources include fossil fuel combustion and waste incineration, and the manufacture of\nalloys, pigments, metal coatings, batteries, and electronics. Cadmium is also a contaminant in\nchemical fertilizer, manure, compost, and sewage sludge. Cigarette smoking is another major\ncause of cadmium accumulation in humans.\n\nLead in the environment is readily absorbed by sediments and soil particles, and is therefore\nlargely unavailable to plants and animals. Leaded gasoline, however, has been and, outside of the\nUnited States and Canada, continues to be a major source of lead emissions to the environment on\nthe continental scale. Lead is also emitted from the mining and metallurgic industries,\nammunition manufacture and use, and municipal waste incineration. It accumulates in the liver,\nkidney, spleen, and skeleton; it can damage the nervous and gastrointestinal systems, and interfere\nwith the formation of red blood cells.\n\nOver the past two years, the Board has reviewed current efforts in the United States and Canada to\naddress the issue of PTSs in the environment, including efforts underway to implement the Great\nLakes Binational Toxics Strategy signed by both countries in April 1997. The Board has\ndetermined that:\n\nmore effort is required to determine the physical and chemical properties of the 29\nindividual and groups of pollutants identified in the strategy;\n\nseveral of these pollutants, including mercury, PCBs and dioxins, persist long enough in\nthe atmosphere to allow them to be transported over large regions, if not globally;\n\nemission inventories for these contaminants are inadequate and should be improved and\nmade accessible to the research community;\n\nattempts to model the transport and deposition of these contaminants should be expanded\nfurther; and\n\nlinkages between significant sources and transboundary receptor areas should be defined.\n\nRecommendation\n\nThe Board recommends that the Commission closely track implementation of the Great Lakes\nBinational Toxics Strategy at regular intervals and review the progress in completing specific\nelements of the strategy as identified by the Board under the strategy."}
{"text":"Ship engine exhaust emissions make up more than a quarter of nitrogen oxide emissions generated in the Australian region according to a recently-published study by CSIRO and the Australian Maritime College in Launceston. Nitrogen oxide is a non-greenhouse gas, unlike similarly named nitrous oxide. The remainder comes from road and air transport, energy generation, and industrial processes. Global studies indicate that shipping emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulphur contribute to the formation of photochemical smog and particles near land and in ports.\n\nThe authors, Dr Ian Galbally from CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, and the Australian Maritime College's Dr Laurie Goldsworthy estimate that approximately 30 per cent of anthropogenic nitrogen oxide emissions and 20 per cent of oxides of sulphur emissions generated in the Australian region may come from shipping.\n\nThese are non greenhouse gases which have the potential to affect the air quality near coastal regions, and have consequences for human health and amenity.\n\nDr Galbally said around 10 per cent of global shipping freight passes through Australian ports annually. \"Shipping is a major driver in the Australian economy, with 753 Mt of international exports worth $202 billion passing through Australian ports in 2008-2009.\"\n\n\"There is limited knowledge about the emissions from ships in coastal regions and ports in Australia, the effects of these emissions on air quality in the surrounding coastal and portside urban regions, or potential effects on human health\" he said.\n\nThe ports of Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane are located where seasonally-prevailing onshore winds dominate and the pollutants from shipping frequently will be carried into the air-sheds of these major urban population centres.\n\n\"We're seeing increasing regulation of land-based emissions but limited regulation of shipping emissions and expect that in the near-future there will be a need to monitor more closely emissions from shipping,\" Dr Galbally said.\n\nThe authors commenced this study with measurements of ship exhaust emissions on the coastal cement carrier MV Goliath.\n\nDr Goldsworthy said it is possible to quantify emissions generated based on knowledge of fuel type, fuel origin, engine size, cargo, and speed.\n\n\"We know from previous studies and the Australian Pollutant Inventory that ship emissions off the coast of Australia are substantially larger than in-port ship emissions.\"\n\n\"Nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxide emissions at sea are comparable in magnitude with other national sources such as energy generation and industry. They are potentially significant contributors to the air-sheds of major coastal cities,\" he said.\n\nThe study appeared recently in the journal Air Quality and Climate Change.\n\nZimbabwe utility halts disconnections Harare, Zimbabwe (UPI) Aug 30, 2012 The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority has halted disconnecting customers, a shift in policy that had been developed because of a epidemic of customers not paying thjeir bills.\nZESA, the state-owned power company that is Zimbabwe's sole electricity generator and supplier for the nation's public grid, stopped the process of disconnections of both domestic and commercial customers whil"}
{"text":"Huffington Post: The recent headline that 100 million people will die by 2030 if climate change is not addressed doubtlessly had people around the world imagining doomsday catastrophes. Don't panic just yet, as this figure is perhaps a textbook example of how to lie with statistics. DARA, the Spain-based humanitarian NGO that released the report on the economic and health consequences of climate change, counted not just climate change but also all other impacts of carbon fuel usage in its calculation of the expected deaths.\n\nAround 90 million of these projected 100 million deaths will actually be caused by non-global warming related illnesses. While attempting to raise awareness and inspire action to prevent further climate change is laudable, this exaggeration spreads misinformation about the real determinants of environmental health. Additionally, this further confuses the public who are already confused and mislead by global warming reporting.\n\nThe major causes of death in DARA's projection of 100 million are indoor smoke and air pollution, which together caused over 90 percent of carbon-fuel related deaths in 2010, according to DARA's own figures. These illnesses are projected to remain the most important carbon-fuel related causes of death even as global warming progresses and intensifies (they are still 88 percent of DARA's projected deaths in 2030).\n\nHow does indoor smoke cause death millions of deaths? The World Health Organization estimates that around 3 billion people worldwide burn wood, coal, and biomass in poorly ventilated stoves and dwellings, leading to a chronic state of indoor air pollution. This is a leading cause of childhood pneumonia and COPD and lung cancer among adults, causing the deaths of 2 million per year as estimated by the World Health Organization.\n\nOutdoor air pollution, estimated by DARA to have caused 1.4 million deaths in 2010, is also distinct from climate change. Currently, deaths from air pollution is a major problem in rapidly industrializing, middle-income countries like China. The DARA report recognizes that \"technology, such as particle filters for vehicles, high quality reined fuels, and regulations on clean air are the main tools for limiting toxic emissions. Air pollution and its negative effects for health can and have been brought under control through these means in major economies of the world\" (pg 257).\n\nBy intentionally conflating global warming deaths and all effects of carbon fuel pollution, this report distracts us from the real solutions that can reduce carbon related mortality. Ultimately, what is needed to prevent 90 percent of these so-called \"global warming deaths\" is not a halt or reversal of global warming. It is the adoption of air-pollution alleviating technology in middle-income, industrializing economies and better cooking technology (ventilation or electric stoves) in low-income countries. This report contributes to the very real and growing misunderstanding that climate change is the only, or the most important issue in environmental sustainability and health.\n\nThe media coverage of this misleading report fuels unnecessary and unproductive disaster paranoia. However, this misunderstanding is not simply caused by bad reporting. This is intentional exaggeration and conflation from the authors of the report. The report, titled \"Climate Vulnerability Monitor: A Guide to the Cold Calculus of a Hot Planet\" is consistently framed as if its exclusively about climate change, with other impacts of air pollution only an afterthought when it is necessary to exaggerate statistics.\n\nBeyond the issue of exaggeration, this report also misrepresents the amount of uncertainty surrounding their projections of the health implications of global warming. For example, there is some fear that malaria, a disease now confined to tropical climates, could expand as temperatures around the world rise, but this is very speculative and still the subject of academic debate.\n\nFinally, the report uses these statistics to emphasize that \"climate injustice is extreme\" because the most developed countries are main contributors of global warming, while less developed countries are the most likely to bear the costs. However, most of the deaths caused in the developing world as reported in this are related to indoor smoke from cooking. Economic injustice is extreme, and the health effects of poverty are terrible, but making exaggerated and inaccurate projections about the health effects of global warming does not right any wrongs"}

{"text":"Indoor Air Quality Tips\n\nDid you know that indoor air quality can be two to five times more polluted than outdoor air?\n\nWhile you might not be able to see contaminants in the air in your home, you may be breathing in millions of microscopic particles that include pollen, radon, mold spores and dust mite debris. Over time, poor air quality can lead to mild discomfort with minimal exposure and to more serious symptoms such as asthma and severe allergies with prolonged exposure.\n\nMaintain Indoor Air Quality with HVAC\n\nControlling the Sources of Pollution\n\nA large amount of indoor air impurities stem from unclean duct systems. If you have a duct system in your home, you should invest in professional duct cleaning to remove as many allergens from your home as possible.\n\nChanging Filters Regularly\n\nCentral HVAC units have filters to catch dust and other contaminants in the air. Make it a priority to change or clean the filters on a regular basis, following the instructions from the manufacturer.\n\nControlling Humidity & Moisture\n\nToo much humidity in your home can lead to mold, mildew and dust mites. Too little humidity can lead to cracked walls and damaged wood furnishings. Use a humidity gauge to maintain an indoor humidity between 30 and 50 percent. You can increase humidity with a humidifier or you can decrease humidity by running your air conditioning.\n\nImprove Ventilation\n\nIn an effort to improve heating and air conditioning efficiency, most new homes are as air tight as Tupperware. As a result, any contaminants that get into your home will stay there. Keep air circulating as much as possible with ceiling fans, ventilation fans in bathrooms and kitchens and open windows (when it's not too hot or cold outside).Use an Electronic Air Cleaner\n\nElectronic air cleaners purify air as it moves through your ducts, before it goes into your home. These are a highly effective way to trap bacteria and dust before they get into the main areas of your home. If you're thinking about installing an electronic air cleaner, be sure to choose the kind you want carefully: HEPA air cleaners will filter out small particles such as dust, smoke, pollen, etc., and ozone-ionizer air cleaners are great for eliminating odors, particular cigar and cigarette smoke.\n\nUse Chemical Cleaners Sparingly\n\nMost of the time, household chemical cleaners are as tough on spots and stains as they are on your health. When possible, substitute the use of chemicals for natural ingredients like baking soda and white vinegar. If that sounds like too much work, look for cleaner brands that are labeled non-toxic.Ready to schedule service or learn more? Call us today! (888) 388-1845"}
{"text":"and Gasoline Exhaust: How to Help Protect Your Business and Your Employees\n\nDiesel and gasoline exhaust can be hazardous to employees working in automotive service businesses.\n\n\"Boss, I'm feeling kind of light headed.\" Diesel and gasoline exhaust can be hazardous to employees working in automotive service businesses. And not just those working in the shop are at risk; office employees can also be exposed through poor ventilation systems.\n\nSo what can you do to protect your business and employees from dangerous exhaust fumes? It's critical to understand the health risks, continually measure diesel and gasoline exhaust levels in the workplace, and plan and communicate how to handle hazardous materials, including diesel and gasoline exhaust, to employees. But first, let's start with the basics \u2013 what is diesel and gasoline exhaust?\n\nWhat is diesel and gasoline exhaust?\nDiesel and gasoline exhaust is emitted as a result of the combustion of diesel or gasoline fuel and is made up of two types of materials: gases and particulates (soot). Some of the gases found in diesel and gasoline exhaust, such as nitrogen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, are relatively harmless. However, other gases found in diesel and gasoline exhaust, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, phenol, formaldehyde and PAHs (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons), can be very harmful to humans.\n\nThe other material exhaust is composed of are very small particles and clumps of particles (soot). The chemicals found in the gas attach to the surface of the particles. As you breathe in particles \u2013 and you can breathe a lot of them deep into the lungs \u2013 these potentially harmful chemicals are inhaled as well.\n\nHealth effects\nAvailable data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows short-term and long-term exposure to diesel and gasoline exhaust can cause signifi cant health issues. Short-term exposure to diesel and gasoline exhaust can cause irritation to the eye, nose, throat, respiratory systems, and neurological systems which may be temporarily debilitating. Evidence also shows exposure can aggravate existing respiratory allergies. Typical symptoms include headache, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, and numbness or tingling of the extremities, and in persons with pre-existing heart disease and atherosclerosis, chest pain and leg pain.\n\nRepeated, long-term exposure to diesel and gasoline exhaust can pose a hazard for chronic inflammation in the lung and can increase the risk for lung cancer.\n\nMeasuring and monitoring\nDiesel and gasoline exhaust is not something that can be measured directly. There are currently no federal Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) for diesel or gasoline exhaust provided by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) nor the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA).\n\nAccording to the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, industrial hygienists typically choose among several compounds found in diesel or gasoline exhaust to measure and use that compound as a surrogate for the whole. Some components typically chosen include total particulates, elemental carbon, PAHs, and carbon monoxide.\n\nIf either total particulates or elemental carbon is chosen to measure, an air-sampling pump with a filter can be used. To measure PAHs, an airsampling pump with charcoal tubes is needed. For carbon monoxide, either a carbon monoxide meter or a hand-held detector tube pump with carbon monoxide tubes can be used.\n\nThe PEL provided by OSHA for Carbon monoxide is 55 micrograms per cubic meter of air (_g\/m3).3\n\nOSHA safety standards\nDespite the lack of specifi c standards for measuring diesel and gasoline exhaust, employers should be aware they still have a federal obligation to protect employees from hazardous exhaust in the workplace. According to Section 5(a)(1) of the OSHA Act, often referred to as the \"General Duty Clause,\" employers are required to \"furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.\"\n\nSection 5(a)(2) requires employers to \"comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act.\"\n\nHazard Communication Standard\nAccording to the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, all employers are required to provide the following controls for all employees exposed to hazardous chemicals in their work areas under normal operating conditions or in foreseeable emergencies:\n\n\u2022 Implement a written hazard communication program for the workplace, including a list of hazardous chemicals present\n\n\u2022 Provide employee training programs regarding hazards of chemicals and protective measures; the hazards of diesel and gasoline exhaust should be incorporated in the training program\n\n\u2022 Label containers of chemicals in the workplace, as well as of containers of chemicals being shipped to other workplaces\n\nSafety recommendations and controls\nThe use of risk engineering and\/or workplace practice controls is the preferred method for controlling diesel and gasoline exhaust exposures.\n\n\u2022 The use of engineering and\/or workplace practice controls is the preferred method for controlling carbon monoxide exposures. Propane fork trucks should be maintained and tuned on a regular basis. Substituting electric fork trucks for propane fueled trucks can eliminate the presence of carbon monoxide.\n\n\u2022 As part of the Hazard Communication Standard, educate employees on the effect of exposure to diesel and gasoline exhaust, including carbon monoxide\n\n\u2022 Provide adequate ventilation and exhaust systems that support the entire workshop minimize buildup:\n- Connect tailpipes to fl exible hoses that vent directly outdoors when working engines while overhead doors are closed\n- Make sure on-site adapters fi t every tailpipe and exhaust stack confi guration so the exhaust system is able to be\nused on all vehicles\n- Open doors when possible to allow for cross ventilation\n- Install wall fans; note wall fans do not ensure elimination of carbon monoxide\n\n\u2022 Install carbon monoxide alarms in the service garage; these are similar to household detectors\n\n\u2022 Perform routine maintenance checks on exhaust and ventilation systems to ensure they are operating properly:\n- Check hoses for any holes or exhaust burns\n- Verify adapters are able to stay on the tailpipe and exhaust stack during testing procedures\n- Check fans periodically for excessive noise or vibration\n- Feel the air suction at the adapter at all bays to ensure the ductwork is not blocked\n- Close or block unused hoses to prevent loss of suction for other hoses\n\nFor more information on how you can protect your business, contact your Zurich account executive visit Zurich online"}
{"text":"June 19, 2013\n\nEPA tightens standards for soot pollutionWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson said the new standard will save thousands of lives each year and reduce the burden of illness in communities across the country, as people \"benefit from the simple fact of being able to breathe cleaner air.\"\n\nAs a mother of two sons who have battled asthma, Jackson said she was pleased that \"more mothers like me will be able to rest a little easier knowing their children, and their children's children, will have cleaner air to breathe for decades to come.\"\n\nAnnouncement of the new standard met a court deadline in a lawsuit by 11 states and public health groups. The new annual standard is 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air, down from the current 15 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nThe new soot standard has been highly anticipated by environmental and business groups, who have battled over the extent to which it would protect public health or cause job losses. The EPA said its analysis shows the rule will have a net benefit ranging from about $3.6 billion to $9 billion a year.\n\nA study by the American Lung Association and other groups said the new standard will save an estimated 15,000 lives a year \u2014 many in urban areas where exposure to emissions from older, dirty diesel engines and coal-fired power plants are greatest.\n\nSoot, or fine particulate matter, is made up of microscopic particles released from smokestacks, diesel trucks, wood-burning stoves and other sources and contributes to haze. Breathing in soot can cause lung and heart problems, contributing to heart attacks, strokes and asthma attacks.\n\nEnvironmental groups and public health advocates welcomed the new standard, saying it will protect millions of Americans at risk for soot-related asthma attacks, lung cancer, heart disease and premature death.\n\nDr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association, said a new standard will force industries to clean up what he called a \"lethal pollutant.\" Reducing soot pollution \"will prevent heart attacks and asthma attacks and will keep children out of the emergency room and hospitals,\" Edelman said in a statement. \"It will save lives.\"\n\nBut congressional Republicans and industry officials called the new standard overly strict and said it could hurt economic growth and cause job losses in areas where pollution levels are determined to be too high. Conservative critics said they feared the rule was the beginning of a \"regulatory cliff\" that includes a forthcoming EPA rule on ozone, or smog, as well as pending greenhouse gas regulations for refineries and rules curbing mercury emissions at power plants.\n\nRoss Eisenberg, vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the new soot rule is \"yet another costly, overly burdensome\" regulation that is \"out of sync\" with President Barack Obama's executive order last year to streamline federal regulations.\n\nThe soot rule will \"place many promising new projects \u2014 and the jobs they create \u2014 into permit limbo,\" Eisenberg said.\n\nA letter signed by one Democratic and five Republican senators said the EPA rule would \"impose significant new economic burdens on many communities, hurting workers and their families just as they are struggling to overcome difficult economic times.\"\n\nThe letter cited EPA data showing that air quality in the United States is at its highest level in 30 years \u2014 a sign that the current standard is working, the senators said. The letter was signed by Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch and Michael Lee of Utah, Roy Blunt of Missouri, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Rob Portman of Ohio and Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.\n\nA letter signed by 56 House Democrats said the new standards will mean fewer hospital trips for millions of people and billions of dollars saved.\n\n\"Morally and fiscally, this is a no-brainer,\" said the letter, initiated by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. He and other supporters said the new standards were particularly important in urban areas such as New York and Los Angeles, where soot and smog and can make breathing difficult.\n\nThe letter cited a report issued last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that racial minorities are more likely to live in areas where air pollution exceeds national standards.\n\nJackson and other administration officials said the new rule was based on a rigorous scientific review. Only 66 of more than 3,000 U.S. counties would fail to meet the proposed standard, which takes effect early next year.\n\nThe EPA said it would start designating counties that fail to meet the new soot standards as soon as December 2014, but would give states up to five years to meet the revised standard.\n\nAll but seven counties in the United States \u2014 all in California \u2014 are projected to meet the new standard by 2020 with no additional actions needed beyond compliance with existing and pending rules set by the EPA, EPA officials said. The counties are Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino and Tulare.\n\nJackson and other officials said they will work with states and counties to ensure they can meet the new standards without penalties, including loss of federal transportation money.\n\nThe Obama administration had sought to delay the new soot standards until after the November election, but a federal judge ordered officials to act sooner, and the administration released a proposed rule in"}
{"text":"Ozone Environmental Technologies\n\nOzone (O3) is one of the most powerful oxidizers available. O3 doesn't just mask odors like mere air fresheners, it neutralizes odors at the source, then harmlessly converts to CO2 and oxygen.

{"text":"A new report from the Environmental Science & Technology journal and discussed at Science Daily states that trees and bushes planted in cities reduce pollution levels way more than previously thought \u2013 eight times more, to be exact.\n\nLevels of nitrogen dioxide and microscopic particulate matter are unsafe at street level, and previous studies showed that green plants cut levels down by 5 percent. The new study says that by carefully planning the placement of plants and grasses, these levels can be reduced by 40 to 60 percent. That's an amazing difference and one that should encourage cities everywhere to plant more green plants!\n\nHaving plants throughout your home do the same thing but on a much smaller, local scale. Pollution levels outside the home, in cities, are much higher than they probably are in your home. So if plants can cut pollutant levels that much in a huge city, imagine what they can do for the air you breathe at home.\n\nThis weekend, do yourself a favor and pick up a few houseplants to help clean your air at home!"}

{"text":"Plants purify the air. They absorb certain airborne pollutants through their\nleaves, break them down and\/or transport them down through their stems and\nexcrete them through their roots systems.

{"text":"A 1985 study published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development identified a serious air quality problem.\n\nRelated Content\n\nA 1985 study published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development identified a serious air quality problem. Counter to what the general wisdom was at the time, the study revealed that it was indoor air quality, not outdoor, that was declining at a rapid rate.\n\nThe study found \"levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or highly industrial areas.\" Most alarmingly, it was noted that \"while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed.\"\n\nIn the 25 intervening years, the sustainable building movement has grown from a mere trend to a recognized market segment of the building industry. While that might sound like a boon for indoor air quality, it is more of a mixed blessing, says Dr. Marilyn Black, Ph.D., LEED AP, founder of the industry-independent, third-party GREENGUARD Environmental Institute.\n\n\"The problem of IAQ has become even more pronounced with the green building community's focus on energy use reduction: we're tightening up our homes, or 'weatherizing' them, to save energy, but we're inadvertently allowing high levels of indoor pollutants to accumulate inside,\" says Dr. Black. \"Key sources of VOCs are cleaners, built-in cabinetry, foam insulations, furniture, and remodeling materials like paints, adhesives, coatings, and other treatments.\"\n\nGREENGUARD Environmental Institute was founded by Dr. Black in 2001. GEI is an ANSI Accredited Standards Developer, which means that it establishes acceptable product standards for building materials, interior furnishings, cleaners and products in other categories. The Institute establishes building standards with the aim of protecting the health of occupants through the control of mold, moisture and indoor pollutants.\n\nBlack's advice for kitchen and bath designers who wish to be mindful of indoor air quality is one of content control, rather than mitigation: \"Source control is the most effective way to control indoor air pollution. As a practitioner, you should always select and use third-party certified, low-emitting and nontoxic products; as a manufacturer, you should make sure that you are supplying toxin-free products to the marketplace.\"\n\nProduct Placement\n\nVolatile Organic Compounds are the root of the air quality issue. Think \"new car smell\" \u2013 the cocktail of aromas that are the result of the manufacturing process. Every product has them, whether or not our noses (and allergies) can detect them. Some companies are actively responding to the call for cleaner indoor air by doing away with materials that cause the \"new house smells\" associated with kitchen and bath products.\n\nCosentino's ECO countertop has received GREENGUARD certification, and Lorenzo Marquez, v.p.\/marketing, Cosentino Group North America, says that is one part of the company's overall commitment to sustainability.\n\n\"Cosentino Group takes the role of environmental responsibility very seriously,\" says Marquez. \"We recognize the need for a sustainable product both high in design and performance. The company committed itself to a $6 million R&D investment in the development of ECO by Cosentino, the surface composed of 75% post-industrial and post-consumer recycled raw material.

The rapidly growing population will have an effect on the climate.\n\nCO2 is one of many major pollutants that is a by-product of human activities such as: burning fossil fuels and manufacturing concrete. Smog, another air pollutant that is composed of many different gases, builds up over cities and can harm the respiratory system. In the US, more than 142 million people live in counties that received a failing grade in 2005 from the American Lung Association due to its high smog levels. CO2 is a major cause of global warming,but smog is thought to reduce it. Our goal is to model and simulate pollutant (including smog and CO2) buildup and spread over large cities and regions.\n\nThere is a blanket of false truths covering the controversy of global warming, such as false assumptions like: \"In one volcano eruption more CO2 is released than all of the human race has emitted in their entire existence. We hope to find all the true factors and incorporate them into an animation and simulation that shows the spread of air pollutants.\n\nProblem Solution:\n\nWe will first base our animation on a flat surface with no wind. Then my team will visualize and then simulate the buildup of a single pollutant over this area. We will add factors such as: wind speed, different air pollutants, and topography. We will use the Processing language and publically available data from NASA's Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder satellite (AIRS). The Processing language, unlike Starlogo TNG, is not agent-based, but it can be. We will use the graphical components of Processing.\n\nIt can be downloaded from processing.org. Like Starlogo TNG it is free and can run on any operating system. Processing helps you visualize large amounts of data. It has many books and lots of website info. For an example, check out the examples at openprocessing.org.\n\nProgress to Date:\n\nWe are both familiar with the of processing\/Java languages, and are starting to write our code. We have have determined which important factors are required to successfully visualize our problem.Our team is\nstarting to write the code, and we are mining different data sources. We are also establishing the requirements to make our program run smoothly and realistically.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nWe expect to have a test program fully functional by late January, and a full program that includes these factors:"}
{"text":"Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: Prevention\n\nCarbon monoxide, or CO, is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death. CO is found in combustion fumes, such as those produced by cars and trucks, small gasoline engines, stoves, lanterns, burning charcoal and wood, and gas rangesRed blood cells pick up CO quicker than they pick up oxygen. If there is a lot of CO in the air, the body may replace oxygen in blood with CO. This blocks oxygen from getting into the body, which can damage tissues and result in death.\n\nHow to avoid CO poisoning and what to do if you experience symptoms.\n\nNever use a generator, grill, camp stove or other gasoline, propane, natural gas or charcoal\u00ac burning devices inside a home, garage, basement, crawlspace or any partially enclosed area. Locate unit away from doors, windows and vents that could allow carbon monoxide to come indoors.\n\nThe primary hazards to avoid when using alternate sources for electricity, heating or cooking are carbon monoxide poisoning, electric shock and fire.\n\nInstall carbon monoxide alarms in central locations on every level of your home and outside sleeping areas to provide early warning of accumulating carbon monoxide.\n\nIf the carbon monoxide alarm sounds, move quickly to a fresh air location outdoors or by an open window or door.\n\nCall for help from the fresh air location and remain there until emergency personnel arrive to assist you."}

These pollution control measures were subsequently relaxed after the Paralympics.\n\nZhang's team, which included scientists from the University of Rochester, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and Peking University in Beijing, recruited 125 male and female resident doctors who worked at a central Beijing hospital, all of whom were non-smokers and disease-free.\n\nThe participants, whose average age was 24, visited the clinic six times: twice prior to the air pollution controls, twice while the pollution controls were in play, and twice after the games had ended.\n\nThe researchers examined biomarkers for systemic inflammation and blood clotting, as well as heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nDuring the Olympics, they observed statistically significant reductions in Von Willebrand factor and soluble CD62P levels, both of which are associated with blood coagulation, among the study participants. Soluble CD62P and systolic blood pressure levels also increased significantly after the Olympics.\n\nThese changes indicate that exposure to higher air pollution levels are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular problems, said Zhang, suggesting an immediate health benefit when air pollution levels are lowered.\n\n\"We believe this is the first major study to clearly demonstrate that changes in air pollution exposure affect cardiovascular disease mechanisms in healthy, young people,\" Zhang said."}
{"text":"obsession with being \"green\" with all aspects of building products has been a positive and environmentally conscious thing to strive for. In regard to interior\/exterior paint and coatings, it has become big business.\n\nBeing in the paint industry for more than 15 years, I have seen it evolve to become more and more environmentally conscious over time. Personally, I always considered the smell of a freshly painted room as a clean smell. The fact that so many individuals are bothered by the smell of paint is a legitimate concern.\n\nThe main issue talked about with paints and coatings has been with the amount of VOCs in the paint, which stands for Volatile Organic Compounds. Simply put, the VOCs are the gases emitted after paint is applied and as it dries. People with asthma or allergies can be more bothered by the VOCs emitted and the fumes that drying paint can have.\n\nMost of the paint companies have developed low-VOC and zero-VOC products to become more \"green friendly\" to the environment and consumers. A larger group of consumers are adversely affected by paint fumes resulting in sore throats, watery eyes and trouble breathing. These symptoms can become more serious for women who are pregnant, infants, small children and the elderly, who may have weaker immune systems.\n\nMany of the major paint companies that have continually made improvements to interior and exterior paint products have done so by using solely water-borne tints as well as the base paint. Do your research when choosing the best product for your home and make sure that the paint remains a zero-VOC product even after the tint is put in, because that ingredient has been the component that will encourage the VOCs to go up.\n\nChoose a water-based polyurethane when possible; traditionally these products did not preform as well, but the processes have improved as this green movement will continue to get stronger. Good flooring re-finishers now offer both water-based and oil-based products.\n\nLook for LEED certification, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, as the standard in building products to become even more popular in 2012 as the building and remodeling industry continues to improve."}

You may be asking yourself what hydrodesulfurization is, what a hydrogen sulfide analyzer is, or why any of this matters to you at all. Well, I pose this question to you: do you own a car? Do you know anyone that owns a car? Well, then you have your answer and this all applies to you. Well, this should all become clear in no time. The thing is, the process with the really long name that I referred to earlier is a process that is employed by gas companies. Whenever you get your gas, this is gas that has gone through the process of hydrodesulfurization and it is gas that is going to need to have this done to it in order to make things safe. You need a hydrogen sulfide analyzer in this process to measure the amounts of hydrogen and sulfur that are going into and leaving a compound. So many people are out there complaining about all of these poisons that are being expelled into the air by cars and all these dangers people are being exposed to, but the reality is, sulfides and all forms of sulfur exist in natural gases, and this sulfur doesn't just smell like rotten eggs, but it also heavily poisonous and can kill someone with repeated exposure to it.\n\nGas and oil don't just come from magic holes in the ground where all of the gas in the world is located, they have to be mined and then they have to go through the refining process. This process is the most important part of the mining process because it assures that the finished product is usable. If we did not refine these products and take the sulfurs out of them the emissions of cars would actually literally be poisonous and would kill all kinds of people over the course of just a few years being exposed to car emissions. It wouldn't be safe to drive for much longer if this were an issue. The problem is people don't seem to realize just how big of an issue this is, so they need to go out there and complain about all these other things as if they were really big issues. Big companies take harsh criticisms, but they are actually not that bad and in some cases are really looking out for our safety.

{"text":"E-Insight\n\nJanuary 2009\n\nColorado State University Students Study Health Impacts of Cleaner-Burning Cookstoves in Nicaragua\n\nSince humans first discovered fire and used it to cook and heat their dwellings, they've been exposed to particle-filled smoke and have suffered resulting respiratory and other health illnesses. In less-developed countries, open-fire cooking inside homes today presents a significant health hazard to at least half the world's population. A group of undergraduate students at Colorado State University are researching the impact of cleaner-burning cookstoves on the health of those who have cooked over open fires and makeshift stoves.\n\n\"The exposure to particles and other pollutants from open fires used in kitchens can reach massive levels for women and children - about the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day,\" said Erin McGuinn, one of six Colorado State University undergraduate students who worked in Nicaragua this past summer on a cookstove project. McGuinn and two other students are from the Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, the home department for the project. \"More than 1.6 million deaths each year are due to indoor pollution from cookstoves.\"\n\nAlthough new cookstoves have been installed in homes across Nicaragua and other countries by nonprofit groups, few long-term studies have been done to see how the stoves are used, if they are maintained and if health improves over time. Cleaner cookstoves may be a potential cure for serious respiratory and other issues caused by open-fire cooking, but follow-up research is needed to confirm how much those stoves can impact a family's health.\n\nThe students are studying 125 families in El Fortin, a poor neighborhood outside of Granada, Nicaragua, to determine the positive health impacts of improved stoves installed in their homes. The students traveled to Nicaragua last summer where 12,500 stoves, supplied by the nonprofit organization Trees Water People, were installed in homes. The group of Colorado State students gathered baseline data on the health of the women cooking in the homes obtaining a new stove. The group took health surveys, and used home and personal air-quality monitors, lung function tests, blood pressure and blood collection results to get the data. It will be compared against data from the same homes in the coming years.\n\nOther student groups will travel to Nicaragua during the next several years to test the health effects of new stoves on the women cooking in an environment with reduced indoor air pollution over time. This reduction could possibly reduce respiratory and other illnesses due to indoor air pollution and lack of access to inexpensive life-saving medications.\n\n\"People die every day in the developing world from health problems associated with poverty,\" said McGuinn, who hopes to attend medical school. \"In this village, kitchens were typically made of wood and tin. The women used open fires in the kitchen with little or no ventilation, so you can imagine that walking into a kitchen sometimes stopped you dead in your tracks because the smoke was so thick that you could barely breathe. The walls and ceilings are completely black with soot.\"\n\nSome of the women cooked for up to six hours a day to feed their large families. The average cooking time was four hours per day. Many also allowed fires to smolder all day because it was too time consuming and expensive to relight them during the rainy season. Because the price of gas has skyrocketed, they stopped using it to light their fires and instead used plastic, which emits numerous carcinogenic compounds - as does burning wood.\n\nIn addition to being responsible for cooking, the women also worked and watched younger children who, as a necessity, had to stay near the fires where the women could keep an eye on them. McGuinn said it was common to see women cooking with their children by their side in the kitchen.\n\n\"I think that with the Nicaragua project, we can do something that will make a visible change in people's lives, and we are really excited to have this opportunity,\" McGuinn said. \"Our team had the desire to make a positive change in the lives of an underserved population, something that would cause an increase in the overall quality of life of a large subset of a community.\"\n\nAlong with the Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, the group raised $60,000 to cover equipment, staff and travel expenses. The group split the expenses to install the stoves - $10,000 - with Trees Water People and private donors. In addition to private donations, the project has received funding from multiple sources including the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, which houses the Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences; the university's Office of International Programs; the Colorado Environmental Health Association; CSU's Student Leadership, Involvement and Community Engagement office; and Trees Water People.\n\nThomas Hraha, an environmental health undergraduate student who graduated last summer, developed the project idea. Additional students who traveled to Nicaragua are undergraduates Alisa Tonozzi, Leslie Marchand, Matt Bruno and Danielle Wagner. Faculty and staff members from the Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences helping the students are Jennifer Peel, Maggie Clark, Steve Reynolds, John Volckens, David Gilkey, Erin Reichert and Kenneth Blehm.

{"text":"Radon Test Kit\n\nRadon is a cancer-causing, radioactive gas. Radon is estimated to cause thousands of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. each year.*\n\nYou cannot see radon, you can't smell it or taste it. But radon may be a problem in your home. Radon is estimated to cause many thousands of deaths each year. That's because when you breathe air containing radon, you can get lung cancer. In fact, the Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States today. Only smoking causes more lung cancer deaths.\n\nYou should test for radon. Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk from radon. EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all homes below the third floor for radon. EPA also recommends testing in schools.\nTesting is inexpensive and easy - it should only take a few minutes of your time. Millions of Americans have already tested their homes for radon.\n\nThis radon test kit is for you if you want to know if your home is affected by radon.\n\nYou can fix a radon problem. Radon reduction systems work and they are not too costly. Some radon reduction systems can reduce radon levels in your home by up to 99%. Even very high levels can be reduced to acceptable levels.\n\nIf you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.\n\nRadon can be found all over the U.S. Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water and gets into the air you breathe. Radon can be found all over the U.S. It can get into any type of building - homes, offices, and schools - and result in a high indoor radon level. But you and your family are most likely to get your greatest exposure at home, where you spend most of your time.\n\nEPA Recommends:\n\nTest your home for radon -- it's easy and inexpensive.\n\nFix your home if your radon level is 4 picoCuries per liter (pCi\/L) or higher.\n\nRadon levels less than 4 pCi\/L still pose a risk, and in many cases may be reduced.\n\n* Radon is estimated to cause about 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year, according to EPA's 2003 Assessment of Risks from Radon in Homes (EPA 402-R-03-003).

{"text":"WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 During the past few weeks, the Environmental Protection Agency has released a new facts sheet to help people to learn the difference between symptoms of the flu and carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, as the two are very similar.\n\nThe fact sheet informed that accidental carbon monoxide poisoning is responsible for 500 deaths and 15,000 visits to the emergency room each year. The focus of the sheet was mainly on the elderly, who are more vulnerable to CO poisoning, especially if they have health issues such as anemia or heart or breathing conditions.\n\nIn the United States, carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless gas, is the most common cause of poisoning death. The gas can build up, as it is produced by gasoline engines, stoves and heating systems without proper ventilation.\n\nThe EPA says that people can help prevent CO poisoning by remembering the phrase \"I CAN B\", which includes: Installing CO alarms near sleeping areas; Checking heating systems and fuel-burning appliances annually; Avoiding the use of non-vented combustion appliances; Never burning fuels indoors except in devices such as stoves or furnaces that are made for safe use and being attentive to possible symptoms of CO poisoning."}

{"text":"Carpeting, Indoor Air Quality, and the Environment\n\nCarpeting has become ubiquitous in North America, covering more floors in homes, businesses, and institutions than all other floorcoverings combined. We love it for its softness, dirt-hiding ability, acoustic muffling, and low cost. Recently, however, carpets have come under fire for their potential role in indoor air quality problems, and they've been questioned for their typically short service life. Carpets have come to have two strongly contrasting images in our culture: they represent the warmth and comfort of home, but also the worst of our fossil-fuel based, disposable society.\n\nCarpets have been gradually increasing their share of the floorcovering world for the last few decades. Once a luxury reserved for the very rich, carpets and rugs now cover 70% of the floors in the United States. In 1993 Americans purchased 5.5 square yards of carpet per person, or nearly 1.5 billion square yards total\u2014enough to cover nearly 40% of Rhode Island. Between 1960 and 1993, carpet purchases grew by 654%, while the average cost of carpets in real dollars dropped dramatically. Cheap fossil fuels and mass production have made very inexpensive carpet possible. Our look at carpets addresses the indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns and also some broader environmental questions.\n\nIn 1988 the installation of new carpeting at EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C. led to a rash of health problems and complaints from the staff. This incident became the first highly publicized case of what has been called \"sick building syndrome.\" Although the cause of the problem was never verified, speculation has focused on the adhesives used to install the carpet and on a chemical by-product known as 4-PC (4-phenylcyclohexene), which is released from the carpet's backing material.\n\nSeveral years later, in 1992, Dr. Rosalind Anderson in Dedham, Massachusetts ran some tests exposing mice to air drawn from carpet samples that people suspected were making them sick. Much to everyone's surprise, many of the samples caused severe neurotoxic reactions and even death. Moreover, it wasn't only new carpet she was testing. Some of the samples were up to twelve years old.\n\nThe Anderson Lab findings led to a flurry of activity and concern about health problems from carpets, but even now\u2014two years after their first reports\u2014little more is known about carpet toxicity, and some have cast serious doubts on the validity of the findings. Air quality expert Hal Levin explains that Anderson Labs is a commercial testing laboratory and not a research facility, and their methodology is not scientifically valid. The test Anderson uses, ASTM-E981, or the mouse bioassay test, was developed to determine respiratory irritation, not toxicity. The carpet samples from which the test air was drawn were heated to abnormal temperatures, and the mice were exposed to concentrations inappropriate even for the irritation test, according to Levin. Finally, the air samples to which the mice were exposed were never tested for concentrations of pollutants, even after the mice died.\n\nEPA scientists, using their own equipment in Anderson's laboratory, also found mice dying, according to Anthony Pollino, an aide to Congressman Bernard Sanders who witnessed the tests. Yet when the EPA researchers attempted to replicate the results in their own labs, making modifications to increase the scientific validity of the tests, their results were much less conclusive. Although there are no widely accepted explanations for Anderson's results, much of the scientific community refuses to support her work. \" I regard her results with a high degree of skepticism,\" says Dr. Alfred Hodgson of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories (LBL). In a recent North Carolina court case concerning health effects of carpeting, the judge refused to admit Anderson's affidavit testimony due to her lack of support from the scientific community.\n\nAfter receiving several hundred complaints about possible carpet-related health effects, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) commissioned a study by Hodgson and others at LBL of chemical emissions from carpets. Dozens of chemicals released from carpets were observed and 31 were positively identified. Emission levels of these chemicals were then compared to existing data about their health effects. As the measured emissions were considered peak values to which people would be exposed for only a few hours or days, they were compared only to known short-term health effects. No attempt was made to assess the possible effect of chronic or long-term exposure. As measured, none of the chemicals approached levels known to be hazardous upon short-term exposure.\n\nNew Carpet & Rug Institute consumer information label\n\nOf the chemicals released, most notable are styrene and 4-PC, both of which come from the SB latex backing that is used on 95% of carpets. Styrene is a known toxin and suspected carcinogen. 4-PC has not been shown to be toxic, but it has a detectable odor even at levels below one part per billion and is the chemical most responsible for the distinctive smell associated with new carpets. It is also less volatile than many of the other chemicals measured, so it continues to be emitted at measurable levels for a longer time.\n\nAfter the EPA headquarters incident, all the chemical companies supplying SB latex to the carpet industry joined forces to create the Styrene Butadiene Latex Manufacturers Council. The council coordinated response to public concerns about the material and sponsored several tests on the toxicity of 4-PC, none of which indicated toxic effects.\n\nVinyl-backed carpet tiles used in some commercial installations were also tested. They emitted a distinctly different set of chemicals, notably vinyl acetate and formaldehyde. These, too, were determined by the CPSC study to be at levels far below those likely to contribute to adverse health effects.\n\nThe CPSC study's authors offer several explanations for the carpet-related complaints, given that they didn't discover any notable health hazards in their tests. First, there may be interactive effects between two or more of the many chemicals involved that greatly exceed the impact of any one substance. Second, they only tested four random samples. It may be that periodic fluctuations in the manufacturing process may generate occasional batches of particularly volatile carpet with far higher emissions. IAQ expert Levin echoes this possibility as a likely scenario. Whatever the reason, health complaints associated with carpets, including severe neurological and respiratory problems, continue to surface.\n\nOne component of the problem appears to be that some people are simply much more sensitized to the effects of chemicals that have no noticeable effect on most. These individuals with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) or Environmental Illness (EI) appear to be severely affected by conditions that most people consider normal. Advocates for this community point out that most of them can identify a specific event, when they were exposed to unusual levels of toxins, that \"tipped them over the edge.\" They warn that the syndrome may result from the cumulative effects of low-level chemical exposure and that everyone is potentially at risk.\n\nIn an agreement negotiated with the EPA, The Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI) began a testing and labeling program in 1992. The program was widely criticized by consumer advocates and the attorney generals of several states for failing to warn consumers about potential hazards and for inadequate testing. The program was strengthened in January 1994.\n\nAt present, each carpet line is tested four times a year for four categories of emissions: total volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), styrene, 4-PC, and formaldehyde. As no industry standards exist, somewhat arbitrary maximum emission levels, measured at 24 hours after manufacture, have been established. Products that pass the test can carry the new label (see illustration).\nThe Canadian Carpet Institute (CCI) recently joined with CRI in offering this labeling program. All testing for the program and most of the industry- sponsored research on carpets has been done by Air Quality Sciences, Inc., of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nConsumer advocates are pleased that the labeling program has been improved and that the label now includes a warning for chemically sensitive individuals. They point out, however, that the testing is still not nearly frequent enough to catch occasional bad batches of carpet and that the tests are checking for far too few substances. Improvement is occurring though. While about 20% of carpets tested failed when the testing began in 1992, \"there has been a marked decrease in the emissions of the carpet now being tested,\" according to CRI spokesperson Kathryn Wise, \"and the percentages of those not meeting the criteria are way down.\" Meanwhile, the State of Washington has proposed a program establishing maximum emissions for new carpet used in State projects that are stricter than the industry's voluntary standards.\n\nIt is not at all clear that the carpet itself is the biggest IAQ problem in new carpet installations. The carpet industry is quick to point out that carpet adhesives and seam sealants emit far more pollutants, especially in the first few weeks after installation. Carpet cushions, or pads, may be at fault as well.\n\nIn a typical commercial installation, carpet adhesive is spread over the entire surface, covering between 7 and 16 square yards per gallon, depending on the carpet type. There are many different types of adhesives, but the majority are based on SB latex, the same resin used in carpet backing. With such a large volume used, adhesives have generally been by far the largest short-term source of VOC emissions, but change is underway.\n\nAlthough true solvent-based adhesives have not been used since 1970, most adhesives have continued, until recently, to use volatile solvents to emulsify, or liquefy, the bonding resin. Until 1990 VOC levels in these adhesives typically ranged from 200 to 600 grams per liter (g\/l). Air quality regulations promulgated in 1990 in southern California limited VOCs in adhesives to 150 g\/l. This became an accepted standard nationwide in 1991, according to Ken Knudtzon of DAP, chairman of the Floor Covering Adhesives Manufacturers Committee of the National Association of Floor Covering Distributors. The California regulations are based on VOC levels as calculated from the ingredients; actual levels measured in the adhesives tend to be slightly higher.\n\nSince 1991 IAQ concerns have led adhesive manufacturers to find ways to reduce solvent levels even further, and some now claim a calculated VOC level of zero. They have accomplished this reduction by using heat or other processes, instead of solvents, to emulsify the resin. Several manufacturers, including the W. F. Taylor Company and the Henry Company, now sell only low-VOC products, and products with calculated levels below 50 g\/l are now available from all manufacturers.\n\nEarly generations of low-VOC adhesives were harder to work with than traditional products, giving them a bad name with installers. \"When the new adhesives first came out, their adhesion properties were not as good,\" said Fred Williamson, president of the flooring firm CSI\/CDC Corp. in New York City. Product performance is continually improving, however, as manufacturers get more experience with the new formulations. \"We test some of our competitors' products, and the ones they have now are better than the ones they had a year ago, which were better than the year before that,\" Knudtzon reported. Although the low-VOC adhesives are at present more expensive to make, Knudtzon insists that the cost is no more than 5% higher to the installer.\n\nSeam sealants have been another serious offender, releasing known toxins including 1,1,1-trichloroethane and toluene. The trichloroethane must be eliminated by 1996 to meet new government regulations, and some manufacturers have introduced new formulations with zero calculated VOCs.\n\nMany IAQ experts suggest that the biggest problem with carpets may not be new carpet emissions at all. Once installed, a carpet acts like a filter for anything in the air, trapping particulates and pollutants. Anything carried onto a carpet on shoes or wheels can also become lodged in it. Hydrocarbons from a street or pesticides from a yard can enter the carpet matrix. Outdoors, ultraviolet sunlight eventually breaks down these chemicals, but in the carpet there is nothing to remove them. Frequent and effective vacuuming can reduce the accumulation of such contaminants, but not even hot-water extraction can eliminate them all.\n\nVOCs can be adsorbed onto carpet fibers, stored there for an indefinite time, and eventually released back into the air. Thus, carpet that is exposed when an area is painted, for example, can become loaded with VOCs from the curing paint. These VOCs can then add to the overall pollutant level in the space for an extended period of time, long after the paint has cured and stabilized. Wool fibers appear to have an even greater capacity than synthetics for trapping VOCs, especially formaldehyde and nitrogen oxides. Some wool-industry-sponsored research suggests that such substances are chemically bonded to the wool and will not be released, but such claims haven't been verified.\n\nCarpets are also an ideal environment for dust mites, which consume flakes of dead human skin and leave highly allergenic excrement. Wet carpet is an ideal breeding ground for another allergen: mold and mildew. In fact, most experts recommend that any carpet that has been wet for over 24 hours be removed, because there is no effective way to eliminate the mildew growth. Some aggressive cleaning products can themselves leave toxic residues in carpet, especially if they are improperly used.\n\nThe most common carpets today have nylon face fibers that are stitched into a polypropylene\nprimary backing.\nThe fibers are locked in place with a coating of styrene butadiene latex (SB latex, sometimes called SBR for styrene butadiene rubber) adhesive on the underside. A thick application of SB latex\u2014as much as two pounds per square yard of carpet\u2014is the secondary backing for most inexpensive carpets.\n\nThere are many variations: nylon face fiber may be either nylon 6, made from a single molecule type, or nylon 6,6, made from two alternating molecules. Or, the face fiber can be polypropylene, polyester (possibly including recycled PET from soda bottles) or wool. Except in the case of all-natural woven wool carpets, which are sometimes woven into a jute primary backing, polypropylene is almost always the primary backing material. Higher-end products sometimes have a fabric or polymer secondary backing, often attached to the carpet with a thin coat of SB latex. Occasionally a synthetic foam cushion is laminated directly to the back of a carpet, which can then be attached directly to a hard surface.\n\nIn residential applications, carpet is typically installed using tackless strips around the perimeter, over a cushion that is stapled to the subfloor. Commercial installations typically use adhesive, in two layers if a separate cushion is used, or one if a cushion is built into the carpet or if no cushion is needed.\n\nBacking materials such as styrene butadiene latex are highly reactive compounds, made up of several toxic components. Because they are applied at the carpet mill in liquid form, they may not always see ideal curing conditions. \"The fibers themselves are very clean,\" LBL's Hodgson said. \"Almost all of the emissions are originating from the backing materials.\"\n\n4-PC is an unwanted by-product of SB latex production that occurs when manufacturing conditions and mixtures are imperfect. Even though tests have failed to turn up any evidence of serious toxicity, the industry has reduced average 4-PC levels from 250 ppm to less than 90 ppm since the public concern about 4-PC surfaced in the late 1980s.\nIndoor Air Bulletin reports that some recent tests of SB latex have revealed non-detectable levels. Apparently public concern has led to better quality control.\n\nIn some carpet products small amounts of SB latex are used to attach secondary backings of polypropylene or polyurethane. Woven carpets, because they are inherently more stable than tufted carpets, also require far less adhesive backing.\n\nPVC is controversial as a material, yet two companies with strong claims of environmental awareness are using it as backing.\nBoth Collins & Aikman (C&A) and Interface Flooring Systems make vinyl-backed modular carpet tiles, and C&A also makes a vinyl-backed broadloom product. Larry Moot of C&A defends the backing material as a moisture barrier, arguing that by keeping any water on the carpet surface it prevents unhealthy fungal growth. He acknowledges, however, that with modular tiles liquid can easily seep through the seems. Elizabeth Moore of Interface points out that PVC is uniquely compatible with their proprietary antimicrobial additive, Intersept\u00ae. She claims that Intersept is safer and more effective than the alternatives and, as a result, is often selected for health-care facilities.\n\nC&A is not a member of CRI and does not participate in the carpet labelling program, but they do provide detailed emissions data on their products, which meet the stricter State of Washington standards. Moot points out that C&A's tiles\u2014with their built-in backing and adhesive\u2014meet tighter standards than CRI testing requires for carpet alone. Another plus is that the tiles don't require any seam sealants.\n\nMilliken Carpets, another large carpet tile producer, has a proprietary backing material made of a combination of polypropylene and polyethylene.\nIndoor Air Bulletin reports that Milliken's backing emits only one-tenth the VOCs of more conventional PVC backings.\n\nFive types of carpet cushion are commonly used today: bonded urethane, prime urethane, sponge rubber, synthetic fiber, and rubberized jute. Bonded urethane, the most common cushion for residential installations, is made by bonding together scraps of urethane cushion material from the automotive and furniture industries, and from old carpet cushion. Prime urethane is made by foaming large \"loaves\" of urethane and then slicing them into sheets. While the foaming used to be done with ozone depleting CFCs, hydrocarbons such as methyl butane are now commonly used.\n\nSponge rubber cushion is synthetic rubber material than has been vulcanized, or foamed. Off-spec or waste fibers from carpet manufacture are sometimes made into firm cushion for use where a spongy feel isn't desirable. For all-natural carpet systems, jute fiber bonded with natural latex is available from specialty suppliers.\n\nCarpet dyeing has traditionally been one of the most polluting stages in the carpet manufacturing process, as large amounts of contaminated water are dumped from used dye-baths. Among dyeing systems, piece dyeing of carpets is generally the most wasteful method.\n\nSolution dyeing of nylon is the most environmentally responsible method. Pure pigments are added to the polymer solution as the fibers are extruded. Once a specialty item, solution-dyed nylon is becoming increasingly common, but it works best when making large runs of single-color carpet. Otherwise a lot of nylon can be wasted in trying to match colors on a production run, according to Jerry Dickerson of Monsanto's research division. Some carpets are not dyed at all, but printed after assembly using textile printing techniques.\n\nCarpets and carpet fibers are treated in many different ways to achieve desired qualities. Among these, stain-resistant fiber treatments, such as Scotchguard\u2122, have become standard in recent years. While industry representatives insist that such treatments are safe, some consumers are convinced otherwise. Antistatic and antimicrobial treatments are also used.\n\nAnother process that has a history of environmental problems is the mothproofing of wool carpets. In Europe, where wool carpets are more common, contamination of waterways with insecticides has been a major issue. Most countries have strict regulations governing release of polluted water, so a lot of effort has gone into new approaches. Westex Carpets, in the U.K., is using one of the newest, called the Autofoam Mothproofing System.\n\nAlong with environmental concerns, mothproofing chemicals in the carpet are also a health concern for many. Kirsten Childs of the Croxton Collaborative specified wool carpet for the Audubon headquarters remodel in New York City, and considers the mothproofing a necessary evil. For homes, some prefer untreated wool carpet, but this is hard to find.\n\nMany mills are finding ways to improve their processes to save money and natural resources. After Ray Anderson, CEO of Interface, became committed to making his company a good environmental steward, many improvements became possible. At one plant in LaGrange, Georgia, for example, water use has been cut from 12 million gallons per month to less than 3 million. Technical Manager Lewis Engle reports that the savings were accomplished by finding ways to recycle water from one process to another before discarding it. Solid waste disposal is also a major issue. Tons of off-spec fiber and carpet scraps build up every year, leading to many waste reduction and material re-use initiatives. Carpet fiber is being tested as a reinforcement in concrete. Carpet manufacturer Shaw Industries, Inc., is building a new 120,000 ft2 research and development facility with used carpet fiber as reinforcement. Ten pounds of fiber per cubic yard of concrete was used for the floor slabs, driveways, and walls of the building. Another manufacturer, Collins & Aikman, is making plastic lumber profiles from whole used carpets.\n\nOne of the most wasteful practices in the carpet industry is the use of large binders for distributing carpet samples to designers and architects. They are bulky, non-recyclable, and quickly become obsolete as new carpet styles are introduced. Interface Flooring Systems has addressed this problem by introducing new display binders made of recycled and recyclable corrugated cardboard.\n\nIn another example of waste reduction, Hoechst Celanese recently changed the way they package bales of polyester fiber for shipment to carpet mills. Instead of wrapping the bales with polypropylene and metal straps, the entire package, including labels, is now polyester, like the fibers. It can all be returned to the company for recycling.\n\nCarpet disposal is a major solid waste issue. Over 60% of the new carpet installed is replacing old carpet, amounting to about a billion square yards, or 3.5 billion pounds, of discarded carpet every year. With the tons of carpet piling up in landfills threatening to become another public relations problem for the industry, several carpet manufacturers and carpet fiber producers have been developing carpet recycling programs.\n\nNylon is a relatively expensive polymer, so many companies are working on ways to separate the nylon face fibers from the carpet backing and recycle the nylon. One strategy is to chemically break down, or depolymerize, the nylon. Nylon 6, because it is based on a single source molecule, caprolactam, lends itself more easily to depolymerization than nylon 6,6. BASF and AlliedSignal, the two main suppliers of nylon 6 to the carpet industry, are both focusing on this strategy for remanufacturing virgin-quality nylon 6.\n\nCarpets collected by DuPont for recycling or incineration\n\nBASF has recently announced a program for collecting any carpet made with its nylon 6 face fiber. The company will shave the face fibers off the carpet and, by depolymerization, recycle them back into carpet fiber. The carpet backing materials will likely go to incineration with energy recovery.\n\nAlliedSignal is pursuing a different technology. Earlier this year the company signed a cooperative research agreement with the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) to commercialize a technology developed at NREL called selective pyrolysis. Selective pyrolysis calls for heating the carpet in a controlled manner in the absence of oxygen. Each resin breaks down into its monomer components within a specific temperature range, so by controlling the temperature and other factors, each resin can be recaptured separately. NREL claims that this process can generate caprolactam for less than half the cost of making virgin material and consumes only one-third the energy.\n\nDuPont and Monsanto, suppliers of nylon 6,6, are moving in another direction (though DuPont claims that it has developed a technology for depolymerizing nylon 6,6, and will have a plant running by 1999 to do this).\nThey are focusing on methods for recycling the nylon resin for molding into car parts and other applications. As these uses don't require as pure a nylon resin, they can be accomplished without depolymerization. In fact, Monsanto is planning to license the procedure for a new resin that includes 25% to 30% recycled plastics\u2014a mixture of the nylon and polypropylene from carpets. The company is reportedly negotiating with recyclers for production of the resin and working with The Ford Motor Company on applications for it.\n\nWhile Monsanto is not interested in collecting any used carpet until they have figured out how to make use of the material, DuPont began collecting used carpet in the northeastern states in 1990. DuPont's Partnership for Carpet Reclamation works with major installers, taking any type of old carpet at a cost comparable to what the installer would pay for landfilling. CDC\/CSI Carpets of New York City is one of DuPont's participating installers. CDC\/CSI president Fred Williamson finds the program very popular among their corporate clients: \"They're very pleased to hear that we can recycle their carpet. At no extra cost they can still know that they're being environmentally sensitive.\"\n\nIn reality, however, most of the carpet collected so far through DuPont's Partnership for Carpet Reclamation has been burned for energy recovery. Only carpet with DuPont's nylon 6,6 fiber and polypropylene backing is separated and recycled. DuPont is still researching ways to reuse or recycle the other types of carpet it collects.\n\nIn October 1994, the company announced a $1.2 million expansion of the program, to be operational nationwide by August 1995. Even then, however, the 500,000 pounds per month the company plans to collect will represent less than 0.2% of the used carpet discarded nationally.\n\nSome of the same technologies for re-use of industrial waste fibers are being tested for used carpets. In addition, old carpet can sometimes be reused as geotextile\u2014covering landfills or stabilizing soils under roadways.\n\nSome in the carpet industry argue that, due to its high fuel value and clean-burning properties, incineration with energy recovery is an appropriate end-use for old carpet. A project at Argonne National Laboratories is even experimenting at making clean-burning synthetic \"coal.\" To do this, shredded carpet is carbonized by heating it to 550\u00b0F in the absence of oxygen. The end product reportedly provides more Btus per pound than natural coal and burns much more cleanly.\n\nOne company is hoping to centralize collection services and reduce duplication of efforts by handling carpet collection and processing for a range of carpet and fiber manufacturers. United Recycling, Inc., of Minneapolis, Minnesota, is using a mechanical system to separate nylon and polypropylene fibers from carpets with 90% to 95% efficiency, according to Robin Young, CEO of United's parent company, Environmental Technologies USA, Inc. United Recycling plans to have carpet collection and processing centers operational in a number of major metropolitan areas within two years.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that used carpet in good condition can be donated to nonprofit housing agencies and other charitable organizations. It's safest to reuse carpet that has been well maintained, without hazardous cleaning agents. The Loading Dock in Baltimore sells or gives away 600 to 700 rolls of carpet each year, according to John Lambertson. While most of this is new carpet remnants donated by carpet distributors or retailers, 10% to 20% is used carpet and carpet tile. Hotels are a frequent source of commercial-grade carpet in good condition.\n\nPET, or polyester, is the only carpet fiber made today with significant recycled content. Two hundred and seventy-three million pounds of polyester fibers are used in carpeting in the U.S., about half of which is recycled material.\n\nThe most visible company producing carpet from recycled PET is Image Industries, Inc. (formerly Image Carpets). Image collects and processes post-consumer PET containers for recycling. Their in-house carpet manufacturing plant affords them an outlet for the lower spec and colored recycled resin that isn't marketable for higher-grade uses. This outlet allows Image to specialize in recycling containers other than soda bottles. Non-soda containers tend to be more contaminated and harder to separate from other resins, making them undesirable to less sophisticated recyclers. Image also sells recycled PET resin to other carpet manufacturers, including Talisman Mills.\n\nThough not widely known in consumer circles, Wellman Inc. is an even larger recycler of PET resin, supplying several carpet mills. The recycled content of its material has been certified by Scientific Certification Systems, Inc., of Oakland, California.\n\nPolyester is generally considered to be a less durable fiber than nylon, so polyester carpets are usually used only in residential applications, which receive less wear than commercial installations.\n\nWhile carpet may be a good use for off-spec PET recyclate, high-quality recycled PET may be better reused in soda bottles or other fabrics where it can be recycled again. PET is not valuable enough to justify the cost of separating it from other fibers once it is in a carpet. PET recycler Wellman acknowledges that separating and recycling the PET from carpets is not currently economically feasible. Thus, PET carpets may be made of recycled material, but they are not yet recyclable.\n\nAnother fiber manufacturer may soon increase the recyclability of PET carpets. Hoechst Celanese, the largest supplier of virgin polyester to the carpet industry, is developing a carpet system made entirely of polyester. Shaw Industries, the largest carpet manufacturer, is reportedly working with Hoechst to produce the carpet, named Treviera One. Four or five mills will be introducing the all-polyester carpets in 1995, according to Hoechst. Ironically, although the stated goal of producing the all-polyester carpet is easy recyclability, the product is not expected to be made with any recycled resin.\n\nAs a fossil-fuel-based product, carpet is relatively energy intensive to produce. Most carpet is made using petrochemicals. Even if they are in a safe form in the final product, which some might question, these chemicals must be contained and handled very carefully during manufacturing to prevent environmental and health problems. But carpet's biggest drawback from a lifecycle perspective is its short useful life compared to other floorcoverings.\n\nThe most commonly quoted useful life for both residential and commercial carpet is eight years. Allowing for replacement costs, any long-term lifecycle cost or environmental lifecycle assessment paints a harsh picture of carpet. A recent study by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation comparing the embodied energy and environmental impacts of several flooring materials pronounced carpet to be the worst.\n\nSimilarly, an environmental lifecycle assessment comparison of linoleum, vinyl, wool carpet, and nylon carpet from the University of Utrecht in The Netherlands put the nylon carpet at the bottom. Indoor air quality impacts of the materials were not considered in this Dutch study, which pronounced natural linoleum the clear winner, followed by wool carpet, sheet vinyl, and nylon carpet. The wool carpet compared in the study was tufted, with synthetic backing and adhesive, not natural backing. The energy required to ship the wool from New Zealand was estimated at 10% of the total embodied energy of the carpet and would likely have been an even higher fraction of the total for all-natural carpet.\n\nBoth of these lifecycle assessments looked only at standard residential carpet products. These products typically use lower-quality nylon and relatively large amounts of SB latex adhesive\u2014about 28 ounces per square yard of carpet\u2014to bind the fibers to the backing. Some higher-quality commercial-grade carpets are likely to be less toxic and may rate better from an overall environmental perspective. Woven carpets, for example, require far less adhesive than the far more common tufted products.\n\nIn spite of all the research and development that has gone into synthetic fibers for carpets, wool is still considered the most desirable fiber, according to CRI, and for good reasons. Wool has appearance characteristics that synthetics have not yet matched, it has natural flame resistance, and it remains more durable than most synthetics. In fact, after the World Trade Center bombing in New York last year, extensive repairs were done to the main lobby with the original wool carpet in place, on the assumption that it would have to be replaced. After the last machines drove out, however, the managers discovered, much to their surprise, that with a thorough cleaning the carpet remained as good as new.\n\nA rash of alleged health problems with carpet have yet to be properly explained, suggesting that all carpets, and especially the less expensive synthetics, should be used with great caution. In addition, the relatively short life expectancy of most carpet and the heavy dependence on fossil fuels as a raw material make it incumbent on those specifying carpet to see that it will be maintained and protected for a long, safe service life.

Air used in combustion is of two types, (i) primary air (which air is mixed with the gas or liquid fuel prior to combustion) and (ii) secondary air (air admitted to the flame without prior mixing with the fuel). The term \"excess air\" refers to the air passing up the flue and not actually used in combustion.

The primary gases of dry air are nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). Trace gases and aerosols make up the remaining 1%. The trace gases include argon, neon, helium, krypton and xenon; hydrogen; and the greenhouse gases. The water vapour content of air can also be significant, but is highly variable with time and from one region to the next. In some locations it can be virtually absent, while in others it can represent a few percent of air volume. Most air is found in the lowest 10 kilometres of the atmosphere.\n\nAir is made up of approximately 20.95% Oxygen, O2, 78.08% Nitrogen, N2, .03% Carbon Dioxide, CO2, and .94% water vapor and trace elements or gases. For most non scientific purposes or applications, these values are rounded up to 21% O2 and 79% N2\n\nThe mixture of gases forming the atmosphere. Dry air is composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen with small amounts of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, ozone, and the inert gases. Moist air contains, in addition, varying amounts of water vapor.\n\nThis is considered the mixture of gases that make up the earth's atmosphere. The principal gases that compose dry air are Nitrogen (N2) at 78.09%, Oxygen (O2) at 20.946%, Argon (A) at 0.93%, and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) at 0.033%. One of the most important constituents of air and most important gases in meteorology is water vapor (H2O).\n\nMixture of gases forming the earth's atmosphere, consisting of nitrogen (\u223c78 percent), oxygen (\u223c21 percent), water vapor, and other trace gases such as carbon dioxide, helium, argon, ozone, or various pollutants. The concentration of water vapor is very variable, being a strong function of temperature and, hence, altitude in the atmosphere. Dry air is referred to as air from which measurable amounts of water vapor have been physically removed. Pure, dry air has a density of 1.293 kg m\u22123 at a temperature of 273 K and a pressure of 101.325 kPa. Apart from the variability of water vapor, the composition of air is essentially constant to an altitude of at least 50 km and is presently approximated as follows. The concentration of ozone is variable, between 10 and 0.1 parts per million. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have all been increasing since the beginning of the industrial age.\n\nso-called \"pure\" air is a mixture of gases containing about 78 percent nitrogen; 21 percent oxygen; less than 1 percent of carbon dioxide, argon, and other inert gases; and varying amounts of water vapor\n\nAll air supplied to mechanical equipment and appliances for combustion, ventilation, cooling, etc. Standard air is air at standard temperature and pressure, namely, 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) and 29.92 inches of mercury (101.3 kPa).\n\nAccording to modern science, air (the atmosphere) is a mixture of many compounds, but in traditional cultures, air is often seen as a universal power or pure substance.

{"text":"Air Quality\n\nISSUE SUMMARY\n\nAir quality is an issue of growing concern to Canadians. The emission into air of substances such as Particulate Matter (PM), as Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) that contribute to Smog, Acid Rain as well as other hazardous air pollutants such are mercury are coming under increased scrutiny. The generation of electricity with fossil fuels is a significant contributor to the release of a number of these substances into air.\n\nIn 1998, the electric power generation share of national emissions of SO2, NOx, and Mercury were 20%, 10% and 25% respectively. The majority of these emissions are found in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, reflecting the importance of coal-fired generation in these regions as well as some continued reliance on oil in Atlantic Canada.\n\nElectricity generation contribution to air quality concerns is largely dependent on fuel type, combustion process and regional\/local air quality. These factors can vary significantly both within a region and across the country; coal burned in Nova Scotia is quite different from that in Alberta, combustion processes vary from plant to plant, and air quality issues can be quite regional (i.e. acid rain in the east, smog in Ontario and Quebec).\n\nINDUSTRY RESPONSE\n\nCurrently, the electricity Industry is working cooperatively with the federal government to find an equitable approach for emission reductions under the Clean Air Regulatory Framework. Measures to address air emissions must be adapted, however, to suit the diversity of technologies, fuel\/generation sources, environmental pressures, political and socio-economic climates from region to region. Strategies adopted to address these issues generally adhere to a set of principles aimed at optimizing solutions:\n\nContinued provision of safe, affordable, and reliable electricity\n\nIntegrated management of various air emissions (SO2, NOX, PM, Hg, and CO2)\n\nAccommodation of full fuel\/generation source diversity\n\nConsideration of regional differences, in electricity supply and demand as well as air quality issues\n\nFlexibility of implementation mechanisms, allowing a full array of market and other instruments\n\nWith these principles in mind, companies are working along the four basic paths available for effectively managing air emissions: reducing electricity demand; reducing emissions associated with electricity generation; capturing\/controlling emissions; and reducing emissions from other sources (offsets). Companies are developing and implementing strategies that incorporate some or all of the above pathways. In the changing marketplace the impetus for company-run demand-side management strategies is much diminished, however, CEA is currently working with Natural Resources Canada to investigate mechanisms for promoting such strategies. Significant work has also been done through the implementation of processes and technologies that effectively reduce the level of emissions from generation and control releases. Ongoing research and development will continue to improve the effectiveness of these approaches. The industry also continues to pursue strategies to address greenhouse gas emissions that have significant implications for air quality emissions.\n\nIn 2002 CEA embarked on an intensive program to improve the information around mercury inventories, measurement and control.

Coal Blooded: Putting Profits Before People addresses the issue of coal-fired power plant pollution and its disproportionate impact on communities of color.\n\nThe grassroots groups Indigenous Environmental Network and Little Village Environmental Justice Organization partnered with lead researcher and author Adrian Wilson and several other contributors to create this study. This coalition scored, graded, and ranked the nation's coal power plants based on the impact of each plant's pollution output on the health, economics, and environment of nearby neighborhoods.\n\nIts findings show that of the six million people living within three miles of our nation's 378 coal power plants, these citizens have an average per capita income of $18,400 per year. Communities of color represent 39 percent of this group, according to the report.\n\nThe top ten coal-energy producing states have an average lung cancer rate of 98.3 per 100,000 people, or 19 percent higher than the U.S. average; the bottom ten states have an average lung cancer rate of 77.2 per 100,000 \u2014 nearly 7 percent lower than the national average, according to a 2006 report by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention. For residents in states such as Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, which were found to have eight of 12 \"worst offending\" coal plants according to Coal Blooded, these facts might prove alarming.\n\nYet, the NAACP has had difficulty conveying the disturbing nature of this portrait to this segment of the energy industry. \"The biggest obstacle has been the refusal by coal companies to acknowledge, much less address, the significance of the toxins the plants are putting into the air,\" Jacqueline Patterson, director of the NAACP's Environmental and Climate Justice Program, told theGrio. \"Instead, they will obstinately deny that these toxins are affecting human health and will deny the contribution to our carbon dioxide load or even deny the impact of carbon dioxide on climate change.\"\n\nMuch of the information available on this environmental justice issue is not geared towards the \"average person,\" said Patterson. To remedy this, the Coal Blooded report will serve as the launching point for a campaign to address coal power plant pollution, including youth-friendly toolkits.\n\n\"It's very easy right now to talk about climate change as something that is theoretical, to talk about the dirtiness caused by coal plants as something that is aesthetic,\" NAACP president Benjamin Todd Jealous told The Daily Climate. \"But when you \u2026 actually meet with people in these communities, the stories that they tell you \u2013 about their children's lives being diminished, about older people in the communities lives being shortened by the presence of these plants \u2013 are disturbing.\""}

Mineral dust originates from both asphalt and anti-skid aggregates and the dust is deposited on the ground.\nDuring late winter, especially when the surfaces of roads dry out, the dust rises into the air.\nUrban dust can be hazardous to health and it lowers the quality of everyday life in cities. In order to protect people from the effects of airborne particles, new European limiting values for PM10 (thoracic particles <10 \u03bcm) concentrations in the air have been decided (European Council Directive 1999\/30\/EC). During springtime, dust episodes, the actual PM10 concentrations in Finnish cities are often clearly higher than the new limiting values. The European Union member states are allowed to exceed the prevailing limiting values in specified areas, if it can be shown that this is caused by the winter maintenance of roads.\nThe present study is an extension to studies of Kupiainen et al. (2001) and R\u00e4is\u00e4nen et al. (2002). Kupiainen et al. (2001) found that anti-skid aggregate wears the pavement more than expected and named this phenomenon as the sandpaper effect. According to R\u00e4is\u00e4nen et al. (2002) successive breakage of particles into smaller particles with more wearing surface can be minimized by using anti-skid aggregates with good resistance to fragmentation. The other important property, relevant to production of urban dust, is the particle size distribution of anti-skid aggregates (R\u00e4is\u00e4nen et al. 2002).\nIn the present study, more emphasis has been put on the particle size distribution of anti-skid aggregates and new anti-skid materials have also been tested.\n\nThe similarity algorithm calculates how much two contents in the system are similar to one another.

{"text":"Pollutant causes delayed flowering in plants\n\nDURHAM, N.C. -- Biologists have discovered that the air pollutant nitric oxide acts as a plant hormone to delay flowering in plants. The scientists discovered that while plants produce their own internal nitric oxide to regulate flowering, they are also influenced by external concentrations of the chemical.\n\nThe scientists said that although their findings are basic in nature, they suggest that the massive amounts of nitric oxide emitted as air pollutants from burning fossil fuels could affect the critical process of plant flowering. Since the decision to flower is so critical to reproduction, a delay in flowering could have important impacts on ecosystems, both plant and animal, they said.\n\nThe researchers, led by Duke University biologist Zhen-Ming Pei, published their findings in the Sept. 24, 2004, issue of the journal Science. Co-lead authors were Yikun He and Ru-Hang Tang from Duke. Other co-authors were Yi Hao, Robert Stevens, Charles Cook, Sun Ahn, Liufang Jing, Zhongguang Yang, Longen Chen, Fabio Fiorani and Robert Jackson, all of Duke; and Fangqing Guo and Nigel Crawford from the University of California at San Diego. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and Duke University.\n\n\"The floral decision signaling pathway in plants has been studied for many, many years because the decision to flower is so critical to reproduction,\" Pei said. \"And it was known that some of these pathways integrate external environmental signals, such as daily and seasonal changes in light, while others are autonomous pathways that act independently of external cues.\n\n\"However, nobody knew that nitric oxide was involved in these pathways. And nobody knew that plants would be affected by external concentrations of nitric oxide, as might be caused by air pollution.\" Such biochemical pathways are networks of protein enzymes that make up the signaling machinery that controls the flowering process.\n\n\"While our work is very much at a very detailed molecular level, I would bet that these findings have large-scale ecological implications regarding the effects of air pollution on flowering. It is entirely possible that global pollution by oxides of nitrogen could delay plant flowering worldwide,\" Pei said.\n\nPei and his colleagues began their studies by exposing the seedlings of the mustard plant, scientific name Arabidopsis, to a chemical that produced nitric oxide. The researchers found that such exposure enhanced the vegetative growth of the plants and significantly delayed flowering in a dose-dependent manner.\n\nArabidopsis is a widely used model plant in plant biology research, and its genetics and biology have been thoroughly studied.\n\n\"This finding that externally applied nitric oxide delayed flowering was a big surprise,\" Pei said. \"It had been known that internal nitric oxide regulated growth in plants. And, it was known that stimuli, such as drought, salt stress and pathogen infection, induced internal nitric oxide production. But it was not expected that external nitric oxide affected the flowering pathway.\"\n\nTo explore how the molecular machinery of the plant was affected by nitric oxide, the researchers identified mutant plants that produced high levels of nitric oxide and were hypersensitive to the chemical. They found that these plants were also late-flowering. Conversely, mutant plants that produced lower nitric oxide levels flowered early.\n\nGenetic studies of such mutants revealed that nitric oxide appeared to affect genes that control both the environmentally sensitive pathways and the autonomous pathways that lead to flowering, Pei said. Thus, he said, nitric oxide may \"integrate\" both external and internal cues into the decision to flower.\n\nFurther studies, Pei said, will concentrate on understanding the nitric-oxide-controlled regulatory machinery in the flowering decision. Also, he said, the researchers will seek the receptor that nitric oxide plugs into in plant cells -- an activation process like a key fitting a lock.\n\n\"This study will validate the concept that nitric oxide is an important plant hormone,\" Pei said. \"It provides the hard evidence that is needed to demonstrate nitric oxide's role, since flowering is such a fundamental, well-studied process"}

{"text":"What You Need To Know About Using An Ozone Machine\n\nWhat is Ozone?\n\nOzone (O3) is a colorless gas with a distinct odor. Ozone is formed when O2 is contacted by an electric charge.\n\nOzone occurs in nature. That fresh, clean smell after a rain storm results in the creation of ozone. Ozone machines create that same ozone.\n\nOzone is one of the most powerful disinfectants in the world. It is three thousand times more potent than chlorine. It's used in commercial processes for food and water safety.\n\nHow Does An Ozone Purifier Work To Clean?\n\nSince ozone has 3 molecules of oxygen, that single oxygen atom from the ozone air purifier proceeds to \"oxidize\" that offending particle. As a result, the particle will no longer be toxic, and will no longer be able to reproduce, if it is biological. In other words, the toxic particle becomes completely harmless once ozone air cleaners do their job.\n\nThe oxidized particle is destroyed and O2 is left behind (which is pure, clean oxygen).\n\nWhat Are The Benefits of Using Ozone?\n\nHere are just some overall uses to use ozone: Purifies Air, Foods and Water, Oxidizes Odors, Reduce Indoor Air Pollutants, Kills Bacteria, Fungus, Mold, Mildew and Viruses and Reduce Harmful Chemical on Foods.\n\nHome uses: treat moldy basements, get rid of smoke, pet and cooking odors, protect the family from bacteria and viruses, keep plants healtheir, disinfect kitchen containers utensils, and countertops.\n\nMost indoor air problems and odors originate from airborne pollution contaminants like bacteria, mold and mildew growth, spores, and fumes from chemicals. Ozone will quickly destroy these airborne contaminates that are responsible for unpleasant smells.\n\nIn closed buildings without ozone, bacteria is a problem. For people who are already sick it's important to keep bacteria, spores and mildew from growing. Ozone is the perfect choice for eliminating these problems in a natural way.\n\nUses For Ozone as A Medical Therapy?\n\nOxygen (O2), along with foods is the primary nutrient that cells use to generate energy for all its functions. This energy is produced through oxidation of the unhealthy cells.\n\nPrevent, Eliminate Parasites \u2013 A healthy immune system is the best defense against parasites and disease. You can reduce your risk of parasitic infection by washing fruits and vegetables in ozonated water. Wash meats and fish in ozonated water before cooking. Ozonate water to ensure water that is free of parasites.\n\nActivated oxygen is most essential in meeting the high demand for safe food, and with the extension of shelf-life will provide less waste of food products. Its use leaves no toxic by-products or residues and is non-carcinogenic. It is anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasitic, anti-tumor, antiviral and better for health.\n\nGetting Rid Of Illnesses Related To Indoor Pollution- Inadequate ventilation increases the level of odors, pollutants and emissions that you breathe and puts you at higher risk.\n\nAdverse effects may show immediately or years after exposure. Immediate effects include irritation of the eyes, nose and throat. Other effects include: sinus, headaches, fever, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, anxiety, allergic reactions, sneezing, dry cough and fatigue.\n\nOzonated Water Applications - The ozone is introduced into the desired cavity (vaginal or rectal) which introduces up to half liter of pure ozone in humidified gas. The gas then enters the bloodstream through the intestinal walls.\n\nThe process is painless and generally creates increased vitality and well being because the blood is being oxygenated and nourished.\n\nDrinking ozonated water also increases the oxygen level throughout and accelerates the healing process. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is one natural by-product of most ozone oxidizing processes.\n\nSome people with arthritis problems will fill plastic buckets or smaller containers with warm water, large enough for the foot or hand and let the activated oxygen bubble under the limb for about five minutes. The warm water opens the pores allowing it to penetrate. After the first or second application, itching may occur. You should experience movement without stiffness or pain soon after with minor arthritis problems.\n\nOzonated olive oil has many therapeutic uses and benefits. Its used as topical applications for dry skin and beauty aid for wrinkles, and for treatment of sunburn. It can be inhaled directly when bubbled through the olive oil. Ozonated olive oil works when applied for cuts, bruises and other conditions.\n\nAnother method of inhalation in low concentration is through room air purifiers. This method is the simplest for absorbing it into the lungs and circulatory system.\n\nOzonating Aloe Vera juice is a SUPER way to help assist your body against infections. The aloe provides the nutrients and the ozonation provides the oxygen.\n\nMedical Ozone Therapy Legal?\n\nMedical ozone therapy can include injecting ozonated air into tissue to kill infection and blood ozone (where ozone is administered by IV).\n\nMedical ozone therapy is recognized in Bulgaria, Cuba, Czech Republic, French, Germany, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Romania and Russia. It is currently used legally in 16 Nations. Eleven in the USA like AK, CO, GA, MN, NY, NC, OH, OK, OR, SC and WA have already passed access-type bills to ensure that alternative therapies are available to consumers. If you live in a state that won't give you access to Medical Ozone Therapy, then write your elected officials and demand it.\n\nA quality ozone generator is a great investment.\n\nDon't breath in ozone directly- Ozone is a powerful and handy helper, but abuse can lead to: decreases in lung function, aggravation of asthma, throat irritation and cough, chest pain and shortness of breath, inflammation of lung tissue and a higher susceptibility to respiratory infection.\n\nMake sure you use your machine to ozonate the air in your house in an open space and run it for 30 minutes to a few hours at a time (not all day, everyday).\n\nThere are many types of ozone machines out there. There are just a handful that ozonate water and air, but these models don't have a strong output for air purifying.\n\nAs of 2008, we found a fantastic model that is made by hand in South Dakota and is not advertised anywhere. It's durable, has a handle for carrying, has two filter screens that can be easily rinsed with water and poped back on (so no maintenance), and has this easy little tube that can be plugged into to purify water instantly. Similar models that are real work horses which ozonate air only, go for about $1300 dollars. While this is worth the investment, we have a better deal on a machine we know you'll love.\n\n\"I use this ozone machine daily. I run it in the\nmorning for a few hours while I eat breakfast. During the times\nwhile I was recovering from Lyme Disease, I would take this ozone\nmachine into my bedroom, close the door and ozonate my air for\nan hour or so before I was ready to go to bed. Then I slept in\nan oxygen rich environment. I also ozonate 8 oz of water (for\nabout 10-20 minutes) and drink it twice a day. There are many\nuses I have not tried yet, but I feel that it's an invaluable\nbuy as I've only had positive results from it and no maintenance\n(which is important for someone like me!). As of right now, it's my top pick for ozone machines.\"\n\n\"I Feel That It's An Invaluable Buy As I've Only Had Positive Results\nFrom It and No Maintenance \"\n\n\"I use this ozone machine daily.

Parasites...not a topic of conversation at any dinner\nparty where I've been a guest. Yet recent health studies show that 85\n% of us have some form of parasite. Headaches and depression also can\nbe caused by them, but the problem is that the symptoms are usually\nso subtle that they could be caused by something else. So how do you\nget them? Impacted waste build up can cause an infestation. This is\nan environment they love. Transference from hand to mouth, exposure\nto other people, animals, contaminated surfaces, etc. etc. The list\ngoes on and on.\n\nBut there are easy solutions to the infestation problem. Detoxifications,\ncolon cleansing and removal of mucus and toxins by various methods.\nI strongly suggest everyone do a parasite cleansing and removal. You\"ll\nbe glad you did.\""}
{"text":"share this story\n\nFifteen years ago this week, my youngest son spent his very first\nChristmas in the hospital fighting to breathe. It was one of his\nearliest battles with asthma, a disease both he and his brother have\nstruggled with over the years.\n\nSo when I say that clean air and children's health are top priorities\nfor me as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, I'm\nsaying that as a mother who knows exactly how vital clean air is to my\nown children's health. It's something I bring to work with me each day,\nand it's part of the reason I'm so excited about a recent step EPA took\nto safeguard the air we breathe and protect our kids from harm.\n\nLast week, we finalized the nation's first-ever Mercury and Air Toxics\nStandards -- or MATS -- for power plant emissions. Before MATS, there were\nno national standards to limit the amounts of mercury, arsenic,\nchromium, nickel and acid gases power plants across the country could\nrelease into the air we breathe. As a mother, I can't overstate the\nimportance of this change. Mercury is a neurotoxin that's particularly\nharmful to children, and emissions of mercury and other air toxics have\nbeen linked to damage to developing nervous systems, respiratory\nillnesses and other diseases. MATS will require power plants to take\nsteps that also reduce particle pollution, which has been linked to\npremature death and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.\n\nThrough the simple act of ensuring healthier air, we can cut serious\nmedical incidents and hospital visits by the thousands. Once MATS is\nfully implemented in 2016, it will prevent up to 11,000 premature\ndeaths, 4,700 heart attacks, and 3,100 Emergency Room visits among\nchildren across the nation. The standards will also help avoid 540,000\nsick days in the workforce, and 130,000 cases of aggravated asthma among\nkids between six and 18 years old.\n\nLike any parent of a child with asthma, I can tell you that the benefits\nof clean air protections like MATS are not just statistics and abstract\nconcepts. What we're really talking about with the numbers above are\npregnant mothers who can rest easier knowing their children won't be\nexposed to harmful levels of mercury in critical development stages.\nWe're talking about reducing the levels of mercury in the fish that we\nand our kids eat every day. We're talking about future generations\ngrowing up healthier because there is less toxic pollution in the air\nthey breathe.\n\nThat is what environmental protection and the work of the EPA is all\nabout.\n\nNow, as a mother I am also deeply concerned about the economy. The good\nnews is, we don't have to choose between clean air and economic growth.\nNot only will MATS provide the American people with health benefits\nbetween $37 billion and $90 billion, but we also estimate that\nimplementing the standards will support jobs and opportunities for\nAmerican workers.\n\nTo meet the MATS standards over the next several years, many power\nplants will upgrade their operations with modern and widely available\npollution control technology. There are about 1,100 coal-fired units\ncovered by the MATS rule, and about 40 percent don't use advanced\npollution controls. Increased demand for scrubbers and other advanced\npollution controls will mean increased business for American companies\nthat lead the way in producing pollution control technology.\n\nBut that's just the start. Power plants making upgrades will need\nworkers to build, install, operate and maintain the pollution controls.\nAs the CEO of one of the largest coal-burning utilities in the country\nrecently said about cutting emissions by installing pollution control\ntechnology, \"Jobs are created in the process -- no question about that.\"\nThe EPA estimates that the demand for workers will support 46,000\nshort-term construction jobs and 8,000 long-term jobs.\n\nAs we come together this time of year with our families and do so much\nto make our children happy, I'm glad that the EPA is taking action to\nmake families and children healthy -- now and for the years to come.\n\nAs Administrator, I'm proud of what MATS will do to safeguard the air we\nbreathe. And as a mother, I know exactly how important that is.\n\nFifteen years ago this week, my youngest son spent his very first\nChristmas in the hospital fighting to breathe. It was one of his\nearliest battles with asthma, a disease both he and his brother have\n...\n\nFifteen years ago this week, my youngest son spent his very first\nChristmas in the hospital fighting to breathe. It was one of his\nearliest battles with asthma, a disease both he and his brother have\n...\n\nHow much will this cost industry and finally how much will the consumer get hit? I don't see anything in your article on this very important issue. Also, where do you get your stats about saving the children?\n\nThe EPA failed to mention that the electric utility industry INCLUDING coal fired plants have been beyond compliance for several several years and IN FACT set the bar higher than other industries or the requirements stated by the EPA. The EPA FAILED to prove the so called statistics. Consider this, if approx 1100 units are shut down and another 700 units are forced to upgrade, the cost due to the so called increased jobs will triple. The value of the increased jobs will last only a few years as these are contract positions. Lisa jackson stated that power companies can construct these upgrades in 24 months but did not tell you that it takes on average (due to the EPA and Govt regs) an additional 2-5 years to get the permits. So now the industry must choose.. fines or not run. Guess what they will choose. Hey applaud all you want but when you are on rolling blackouts.. don't scream foul. My experience has been that the \"Turn them all off in the name of health\" crowd screams the loudest when they dont have their convenience's. I wonder if when the numbers spouted of asthma and heart attacks don't decrease as stated the EPA will admit they were wrong.. doubtful.. I believe they will lie and make up the numbers just like before.\n\nIlookforfacts: The EPA failed to mention that the electric utility industry\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nThe more you know about the environment, the harder it is to listen to Democrats pretend they're trying to clean it up.

That amount of mercury would make 20 quadrillion liters of water exceed the standard.\n\nabout 60% of the people are using electricity that comes from burning fossil fuel. About 20% nukes, then hydro. So since you are not using coal or natural gas you are probably using those evil nukes or destroying the free flowing streams with dams.\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nI find it funny how Repubs and industry insiders always point to \"higher electricity bills\"... or \"thousands and thousands of job losses....\" (yea right), yet fail to talk about the literally $500 billion in externalized economic, health, and environmental costs that coal-fired power plants bequeath us with each year.\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\n907,000 signatures were collected in an effort to close loopholes that allowed coal-burning power plants to spew unlimited quantities of mercury and other toxins into the air. The oldest of plants that were grandfathered in under the Clean Air Act will have to modernize to attain a goal of cutting mercury pollution by 90 %. Fish in many of PA's waterways are unfit for consumption because of the preponderance of coal fired plants. I'd like to thank Lisa Jackson of the EPA and the White House for this long overdue update to the Clean Air Act.\n\nsmalljaws: 907,000 signatures were collected in an effort to close loopholes\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\n\".........Jobs are created in the process........no doubt about that.

To understand the degree of this\nrelationship, major sources of ambient particulate PAHs at Seoul, Korea were\nidentified and quantified based on the measurement data between August 2002\nand December 2003. The chemical mass balance (CMB) model was applied. Seven\nmajor emission sources were identified based on the emission data in Seoul\nand Northeast Asia: Gasoline and diesel vehicles, coal residential, coke\noven, coal power plant, biomass burning, natural gas (NG) combustion. The\nmajor source of particulate PAHs at Seoul on the whole measurement period\nwas gasoline and diesel vehicles, accounted for 31% of the measured\nparticulate PAHs levels. However, the source contributions showed distinct\nseasonal variations. High contributions of biomass burning and coal\n(residential and coke oven) were shown in fall and winter accounted for\n63% and 82% of the total PAHs concentration, respectively.

{"text":"Lisa Jackson, the nation's first Black EPA administrator, has been traveling around America calling attention to the dirtiest part of her job: cleaning up toxic pollutants in Black communities across the country.\n\nJackson, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009, is aggressively leading a government effort to rid thousands of abandoned properties of lethal contaminants that have been dumped in Black and minority neighborhoods over the years.\"We're working to lay the groundwork for new policies and new initiatives that will make environmental justice part of everyday environmental action in this nation,\" Jackson said.\n\nAs the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, Jackson has made promoting environmental justice and expanding the conversation on environmentalism one of the seven key priorities of her tenure at EPA.\n\nSo why is Jackson's environmental crusade important? Because in Black communities across the country, children are breathing toxic fumes from deserted gas stations and old industrial sites that could lead to asthma and other serious respiratory diseases. Jackson also wants to provide black communities with more green space and public parks so black children will have a brighter \u2014 and safer \u2014 outlook on life.\n\nThe EPA announced that it has already awarded $80 million to communities in 40 states that will be used for cleanup and redevelopment of toxic properties that include abandoned gas stations, old textile mills, closed smelters, former dry cleaners, factories, warehouses, parking lots, former railroad switching yards, air strips, and bus facilities.\n\nThe EPA program is encouraging redevelopment of America's estimated 450,000 abandoned and contaminated waste sites. These initiatives and jobs are designed for under-served Black and minority neighborhoods \u2013 places where environmental cleanups and new jobs are most needed. Jackson wants to make sure Black families are breathing clean air and drinking clean water.\n\nThe EPA's efforts are making a difference.\n\nIn West Oakland, California, for example, city workers discovered that an abandoned one-acre scrap yard contained high concentrations of lead in the soil. Using $500,000 in EPA funds, the City of Oakland cleaned up the space and re-opened \"Willow Park\" in 2007 which featured a circus, face painting, basketball, and refreshments.\n\nToday, the formerly abandoned park has been transformed into green space with game tables, a plaza for community gatherings and live performances, a basketball court, a picnic area with barbeque pits, open space, a children's play area, landscaping, and a walking\/jogging path \u2014 a place that serves a predominantly black community.\n\nA healthy environment, Jackson said, can improve the quality of life for Black families today \u2013 and for generations to come."}

Thanks to reductions in emissions from coal-fired power plants and the transition to cleaner cars, the air has gotten much cleaner across the nation. However, millions still breathe too much ozone pollution.\n\nMore than 4 in 10 people in the United States (41%) live in areas with unhealthful levels of ozone. Counties that were graded F for ozone levels have a combined population of almost 116.7 million. These people live in the 195 counties where the monitored air quality places them at risk for premature death, coughing, wheezing, asthma attacks, decreased lung function, respiratory infection, lung inflammation and worsened lung diseases. The actual number who breathe unhealthy levels of ozone is likely much larger, since this number does not include people who live in adjacent counties in metropolitan areas where no monitors exist.\n\nTwenty-two of the 25 cities with the most ozone pollution improved their air quality over the past year's report.

{"text":"The adage \"An ounce of prevention\nis worth a pound of cure\" directly applies to health hazards in housing.\nProtecting children and other residents from health hazards in their homes\nrequires preventing hazards from developing, or identifying and controlling\nhazards before anyone's health is harmed.\n\nUnfortunately, in most cases, housing-related health hazards are overlooked\nuntil after illness develops. For example, the standard approach to childhood\nlead poisoning relies on using children as \"lead detectors,\"\npostponing action to identify and control lead-based paint hazards until\nafter a child has been identified as poisoned. Similarly, asthma triggers\nin the home environment usually are ignored until after a child has developed\nasthma or until after an attack requires a visit to the emergency room.\n\nIn the case of housing-related health hazards, the goal must\nbe prevention rather than waiting to treat disease after it\ndevelops. Prevention requires viewing the home as the vector\nof disease and taking safeguards to prevent and control hazards\nin the first place.\n\nWhile some homes present severe problems that require highly trained\nexperts and complex diagnostic equipment, in most homes, much simpler\nstrategies exist to avoid and control health hazards. Most hazards can\nbe avoided altogether through good maintenance based on common sense principles,\nsuch as ensuring good ventilation, controlling moisture and water damage,\nproperly venting combustion appliances, and following basic safeguards\nto avoid exposure to toxics. In most cases, only modest changes in maintenance\npractices are needed to keep homes safe or to avoid inadvertently creating\na hazard during renovation or remodeling. In some cases, low-cost improvements\ncan be made that will significantly contribute to a healthy home. For\nexample, every bathroom and kitchen should have an exhaust fan that is\nvented to the outside to remove moisture and reduce humidity.\n\nIn addition, it makes sense to periodically check homes for clues to\nhealth hazards. One of the most revealing tools is easy and economical:\na visual inspection. It makes good sense to take a few minutes at least\nonce a year to do a visual check of every home for signs of problems,\nsuch as leaky roofs and gutters, plumbing leaks, standing water around\nthe foundation, other moisture problems, peeling paint, and vent connections\non combustion appliances. Serious and complex housing-related health hazards\nmay require the assistance of experts to diagnose and remediate the problem."}

Common sense would dictate that you keep these appliances in good condition and the areas where they operate well ventilated. Note that while newer homes may have safer appliances, these buildings are also better sealed and insulated to trap potentially dangerous CO indoors. The cold weather months also offer a greater chance for CO exposure because of increased furnace and fireplace use.\n\nTo best protect yourself, simply buy a low-level CO detector and install it according to the manufacturer's guidelines in your home. In fact, residential CO detectors, like smoke alarms, are required by law in many states, though not yet in California. Depending on the size of your home and whether or not it has a fireplace, you might need more than one detector. These devices are not expensive and are easy to install, but having and maintaining one is the most crucial step you can take to prevent CO poisoning or its other effects. If your CO alarm ever sounds \u2014 or if you smell gas in your home \u2014 evacuate the premises immediately, leave the doors and windows open for ventilation, and call 911 from a remote location."}
{"text":"Clean Air in Utah \u2013 What does it cost?\n\nHear those two words, associate it with Utah and your next thought is probably\u2014\"It's Bad.\"\n\nNot Bad as in It's cool! or It's hot! But those are both clues to the seasons of INVERSION.\n\nBad as in \"My lungs burn when I breathe in the air,\" and \"I can't see the mountains anymore\" Bad.\n\nBeing the solution-minded, number-crunching Mama that I am, I was excited to join in a roundtable with the folks from Rio Tinto (aka Kennecott Utah) as we discussed air quality.\n\nWhy talk to Kennecott about clean air? Well, they employ many resident Smart People, like Chris, who have studied and worked on the issue for their entire adult life. Plus, dollar-for-dollar, they make one of the largest investments in the state, spending over $1 billion here. As a company, Rio Tinto employs over 17,000 people, makes donations to places like the Utah Natural History Museum and Rio Tinto Stadium, and leads the way on the discussion with other businesses about air quality.\n\nWhich brings me to the idea of cost \u2013 Not all costs are monetary. What does it \"cost\" to have clean air in Utah? Are there social costs? What are the opportunity costs? How about the economic costs? For every cost there can be a benefit. But first\u2026\n\nThe Basics \u2013\n\nLet me lay out some simple facts \u2013\n\nWhat is an Inversion?\n\nWhen a layer of warm air is parked over a big pocket of cold air, it is considered inverted since the normal air pattern is cold over warm. During an inversion, any pollutants or emissions released into the air get trapped under the warm air. Because we live in a geographic area with a valley floor and mountains surrounding us, the pollution gets trapped between the mountains until the weather pattern changes. A good storm front can sweep the inversion away.\n\nWhat is PM2.5 and where does it come from?\n\nPM2.5 stands for Particulate Matter that is 2.5 micrometers in size. Hint: A strand of human hair is about 70 micrometers in size. PM2.5 can be human-caused from construction sites or farms (area sources), power plants (point sources), cars and trucks (mobile sources) or even fireplaces.\n\nWhat's the \"cost\" of having PM2.5 in our air?\n\nBecause it's small, we can breathe it in, affecting our lungs and respiratory system. Not taking a nice, long run outside is an opportunity cost. Perhaps it costs us a trip to the doctor if we have deteriorating health.\n\nTo see it all in action, check out the video \u2013\n\nSolutions may seem to cost us time or convenience but the long-term benefits for everyone are clear, literally \u2014 CLEANER AIR!\n\nWhat Can We DO?\n\nWhen I hear of a problem, I want an answer. We know there's no SINGLE answer to Air Quality in Utah \u2013 Where there are many causes, we have many solutions, both big and small.\n\nSources and Solutions\n\nMore than half of our problem comes from mobile sources \u2013 that's your car and my car driving around town. Another big piece is the pollution from solvents, paints, cleaners, wood-burning stoves, furnaces \u2013 from the hundreds of homes and businesses counted as area sources. Finally, a point source is a specific location like the copper mine, where big trucks drive around. From latest figures, point sources only account for thirteen percent of the problem.\n\nMarking out the sources and causes of poor air quality, I noted another INVERSION.\n\nThe relatively SMALL number of point sources is governed by a HIGH number of regulations.\n\nThe relatively LARGE number of area sources and mobile sources are governed by a LOW number of regulations.\n\nIn other words, if Kennecott doesn't have a permit to drive a truck in its mine, it's not allowed to operate it = Highly Regulated. However, In the Low-Regulation world, we can choose to drive our cars. No one will stop us for not carpooling, even if all of our collective driving causes more harm to our air.\n\nHere are just a few ideas of what Individuals can do to help improve our air quality:\n\nWork from Home \u2013 Ask your employer if you can telecommute 1 day a week. (Cost: Missing out on the water cooler jokes. Benefit: Saving gas and a short commute for lunch in your kitchen.)\n\nTurn Your Key \u2013 Be Idle Free (Cost: A few seconds of time to turn a car back on. Benefit: Save on fuel costs and reduce the emissions from your idling car.)\n\nCombine your errands into one trip (Cost: Using a single, larger block of time for errands. Benefit: Driving fewer absolute miles and having to go out less often.)\n\nCarpool or Use Mass Transit (Cost: Giving up the independent-car mentality. Benefit: More time to read or make friends with coworkers or commuters.)\n\nUse a Snow Shovel, Not a Snow Blower (Cost: Snow removal may take a bit longer. Benefit: You build muscles and you reduce both noise and fuel emissions.)\n\nBecome a Clean Air Champion Business (Cost: Investing time to educate your workplace and register. Benefit: Fame, recognition, warm fuzzies from reduced company fuel costs. Plus I hear you can get a cool gadget for your car to track your idling, with auto-shut off when you've idled too long.)\n\nMy pledge \u2013 I'm a pro at mapping out many errands into one trip. So if you want to carpool with me on your next day of errands, I'll be hitting Costco, the bank, the library and the nail salon. See how easy it'll be to join me for a Mama Errand Day? p.s. I've got a new recycle tote to share too!\n\nMore Resources\n\nStill wondering what more can be done? Here are some great resources to learn more.\n\nComments (5)\n\nMatthew 02\/19\/2013 at 7:07 pm\n\nI was curious why you were using data supplied by Kennecot, that infographic was designed to mislead people into believing that the Bingham Canyon mine and smelter have less effect on the Utah valley air quality.\n\nHi Matthew, is your question whether or not Kennecott has an impact on Utah Valley or Salt Lake Valley air? Kennecott is in the Salt Lake Air Shed (as defined by EPA) not Utah County's air shed. Happy to dig further for your answer if I can understand the question better. Thanks!\n\nHi Robin,\nYou'll notice that higher elevations tend to be above the inversion, which points to living in a place like Park City or up a canyon like Emigration. Still a cost\/benefit trade off \u2013 your real estate $ doesn't stretch as far in those areas. Daybreak is in the SW corner of the valley and is very commuter friendly, so light rail would get you straight to Murray and even to 13th S@ State with a transfer on the University line to get to Judge. Hope this helps and good luck with the move!\n\nThe only places that are \"close\" to the Salt Lake Valley but not in the valley and affected by our inversions would be Park City and the Tooele areas. These are not always 30-40 minutes drives though. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Wearable catalytic surface Sitting in his office, wearing his own pair of catalytic jeans, Professor Tony Ryan OBE scientist at the University of Sheffield, explains how his collaboration with clothes designer and artist Professor Helen Storey MBE at the London College of Fashion, began several years ago. She contacted him after he appeared on a radio science show. Their first work together, called Wonderland, was based on exploring sustainability in fashion. Their latest project is to show us how our clothes can be a catalytic surface to purify the air around us as we go about our daily business.\n\nMobile air purifier The idea for Catalytic Clothing came to Ryan in a meeting at the London College of Fashion. As he idly worked out the surface area of someone's clothes, he realised that it was the same as the surface area per unit mass in a catalytic converter of a car. Thus the human perambulating catalytic system was born. The catalyst cleans up nitric oxide, which in big cities is the biggest cause of air pollution and respiratory diseases.\n\nThe Catalytic Clothing project launched with an air purifying dress from Helen's design collection which they retro-fitted with a spray catalyst. Their Field of Jeans concept is based on the fact that there are more pairs of jeans in the world than there are people and it turns out, the catalyst works really well on jeans. As Ryan says, 'like a crop, the Field of Jeans does the environmental clean up.'\n\nLaundry solution The project is sponsored by sustainable cleaning products manufacturer, Ecover. The plan is to bring a commercially viable clothes detergent to the supermarkets. Much like a 2 in 1 shampoo conditioner, the process deposits the catalyst agent in the cloth while the used detergent is rinsed away. Ryan says one of the challenges they faced was: 'how do you make the right formulation so all the particles go on the cloth and not down the drain?'\n\nAlways thinking about a sustainable future, Professor Ryan is on the alert for an affordable solution to purifying water. His concern is that more children die of dysentery than malnutrition. He says 'knowing that the problem is there, our experience tells us that the flash of inspiration will come.'\n\nLearnEnglish Science activities Why not do a language activity based on this cubed story, Catalytic clothing?

{"text":"Thursday, 07 June 2012\n\nGas Emissions\n\nBy Johna Ferguson\n\nAll the talk today is about \"the green house effect\" which seems to come from not only burning coal but also exhaust from cars. There have been world conferences all about what to do but yet more and more Chinese are buying cars that pollute, and our factories in America still emit tons of pollutants into the air daily.\n\nBut the gas I am talking about is not what the cars or factories emit but what animals, us included, emit. If you can believe it, MedlinePlus says we produce one to four pints of it daily and pass it about 14 times a day.\n\nThankfully most is odorless, but bacteria in the large intestine can cause it to stink like sulfur.\n\nI can remember so fondly my friend's grandma Hetty. She must have been about 75 when I was six. Grandma wore a hearing aid but it was not one of those modern small ear ones.\n\nNo, it was a battery box, much bigger than a pack of cigarettes, which she wore on a cord hanging around her scrawny neck. Attached to it were two lines which went to the plugs she hung over her ears. They had small boxes about the size of a walnut in which the sensors were.\n\nThere were no wires leading to ear plugs so I guess the sensors picked up enough sound and passed it through her head into her ears.\n\nWell obviously they didn't work very well or she'd forget to turn up the volume on the big box so everyone just yelled at her. She was a tiny old lady with not much gray hair and knurled hands. But wow, did she have a temper. If things didn't go her way, we'd all watch out. She actually ran my neighbor's household; the mother just quaked whenever she walked into the room.\n\nBehind her back, we children laughed at her, especially when she let out a series of obnoxious gas odors as she walked across the room, oblivious to it all. Her gas permeated the entire room and we children fled outside to gasp a bit of fresh air.\n\nBut now the tide has turned and we children are now adults around grandma's age. I find that occasionally I'll let out a fart without thinking about it happening; it just does. I look around in sheer embarrassment in case someone else heard it or gets a whiff of it. Oh I could die on the spot when it happens.\n\nI know one should drink more water and also eat slowly to prevent swallowing air but those I things I often forget. So please, if it happens when I am standing by you, don't dash out the door for you may be the next one to join the symphonyJohna - This was funny!\n\nIf only we humans would eat more slowly. and convince cows, horses, elephants, whales, etc to do the same. And if only we could put large corks into the tops of those horrific spewing chemical and gas emitting volcanoes! . . . ! - Sandy"}
{"text":"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday, April 23, announced the availability of up to $20 million grant funding for the 2012 fiscal year to establish clean diesel projects aimed at reducing pollution from the nation's existing fleet of diesel engines and improving air quality.\n\nIn addition to these grants, about $9 million will be available through direct state allocations. EPA estimates that for every $1 spent on clean diesel funding, up to $13 of public health benefit is realized.\n\nTechnology has evolved to make diesel engines more efficient and cleaner than ever,\u009d says Gina McCarthy, assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. These grants enable owners of older diesel vehicles to make investments that modernize their vehicles while making the air in their communities cleaner and healthier to breathe.\u009d\n\nThis is the first competition since the Diesel Emission Reduction Program, also known as DERA, was reauthorized in 2011. The program cleans up existing diesel vehicles, many of which can be operated for decades, by targeting projects that utilize the most cost-effective clean diesel strategies.\n\nEPA has standards in place that make new diesels more than 90 percent cleaner, but older diesels that predate these standards emit large amounts of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). EPA says nearly 11 million older diesels still operate throughout the nation's transportation system.\n\nStates, tribes, local governments and nonprofits are eligible to apply for these grants. Projects can reduce air pollution from older heavy-duty diesel trucks, school buses, transit buses, marine engines, locomotives and other diesel engines. The closing date for receipt of proposals is June 4In this downturned economy, many in congress are looking for ways to balance the budget without raising taxes.

{"text":"Over the last semester, I have researched a coal-dependent electric power plant\nlocated in Boardman, Oregon. As part of my research, I began an email-dialogue\nwith Steve Anderson, the stack emissions expert and environmental specialist\nfor Portland General Electric (PGE).\n\nMr. Anderson informed me that \"construction on the six hundred megawatt\nplant began in 1976,\" one year prior to the passing of the Clean Air Act,\nmeaning that the Boardman plant is held to a far lower environmental standard\nto that of plants constructed post-1977.\n\nWhen asked about the standards the Boardman plant is held to, Mr. Anderson\nmade no mention of the Clean Air Act, but did say that \"the plant is regulated\nunder the Acid Rain rules and as such is subject to SO2 allowance requirements\n. . . we have purchased some SO2 allowances to meet plant needs.\" This\nmeans that Boardman buys allowances from other plants, permitting it to produce\nhigher levels of sulfur-dioxide pollution.\n\nMr. Anderson set up my tour of the Boardman facilities with Tom Myers, the\noperations manager at the plant. When coal is burned to make electricity, it\nproduces a residue called fly ash. According to Mr. Myers, fly ash is \"made\nup of low levels of arsenic, mercury, calcium, and magnesium, and has tested\nnegative for high levels of toxicity.\"\n\nMr. Myers also described special technologies used to prevent fly ash from\nescaping into the atmosphere. Apparently, \"Portland General Electric (PGE)\nhas invested more than $27.5 million\" for environmental safety, which\n\"captures more than 99.5% of the fly ash formed in the combustion process.\"\n\nBut what of the remaining ash? Mr. Myers assured me that \"not all of\nthe residual ash is disposed of . . . it is most often used as an additive in\nconcrete and road construction materials.\"\n\nMr. Myers also me informed that \"PGE uses several dust suppressors,\"\nsprinklers that spray water, foam, or other liquids, \"near coal transfer\npoints to minimize the amount of coal dust that would normally blow across the\nsurrounding area.\"\n\nAccording to the information pamphlet published by Portland General Electric,\nthe Boardman plant also operates a \"liquid waste management program to\nensure that waste-water is safe for the environment, and maintains an extensive\nwater-quality monitoring program on Carty Reservoir,\" preventing any liquid\nwaste from seeping into the public's water supply.\n\nEach year in the United States alone, air pollutants from coal burning kills\nthousands of people (with estimates ranging from 65,000 to 200,000), cause at\nleast 50,000 cases of respiratory disease, and result in several billion dollars\nof property damage. Nevertheless, Bush's Secretary of Energy, Spencer\nAbraham, insists that \"America cannot afford to turn its back on the 250-year\nsupply of secure, low-cost energy represented by the massive coal reserves that\nlie within our national borders\".\n\nSince the current big-business economy prevents the transition to a more environmentally\nfriendly energy source, President Bush has developed a $2 billion, 10-year clean\ncoal technology initiative that began early in March of this year. The plan\nstipulates that the Department of Energy will offer $330 million in federal\nmatching funds for industry-proposed technologies to reduce coal pollution.\nIdeally, the Boardman facility will be enticed by federal funds to incorporate\nnew technologies that will help burn coal more cleanly and efficiently.\n\nDATA\n\n1. When was the power plant built?\n\nOriginal site certificate signed March 24, 1975. Construction started in\n1976. The plant was put into use in 1980 (until then, Oregon electrical generation\nwas primarily hydroelectric).\n\n2. What are its emissions of SOx, NOx, CO, etc?\n\nPermit Limits\n\n2001 Average\n\n2001 Total\n\nSO2\n\n1.2 lb\/mmBtu on a 3-hour average\n\n30,450 tons as a rolling 12-month total\n\n0.74 lb\/mmBtu\n\n17,822 tons\n\nNOx\n\n0.5 lb\/mmBtu on a 3-hour average\n\n12,687 tons as a rolling 12-month total\n\n0.44 lb\/mmBtu\n\n10,770 tons\n\nCO\n\nnot measured\n\nCO2\n\nNo Permit or Regulatory Limit Exists\n\n4,941,637 tons\n\n3. What does it do with its fly ash?\n\nAsh is either sold for beneficial use or disposed on-site in a landfill.\nThe amount sold depends on market conditions and will typically amount to\nbetween 50% and 70% of the ash generated. The ash is made up of low levels\nof arsenic, mercury, calcium, and magnesium, and is primarily silicon-based.\nThe plant produces three types of ash: fly ash, economizer ash, and bottom\nash.\n\n- Fly ash, which has been tested negative for high toxicity levels, makes\nup 75-80% of the ash produced, and consists of a beige, talcum-powder-like\ndusty substance.\n\n- Economizer ash makes up less than 5% of the ash produced, and consists\nof mid-level fly ash mixed with larger particles\n\n- Bottom ash makes up 15-20% of the ash produced and consists of a fine,\ngravel-like substance.\n\n4. How have the standard changes in 1977 effected the plant?\n\nThe new source performance standard (NSPS) due to the Clean Air Act was revised\nin 40 CFR 60 Subpart Da but it became effective in 1978.\n\n5. Does it meet the new standards?\n\nSince the plant commenced construction prior to 1978, it is not subject to\nthe requirements of 40 CFR 60 Subpart Da.\n\n6. Is it involved with emission trading?\n\nThe plant is regulated under the Acid Rain rules and as such is subject to\nSO2 allowance requirements. We have purchased some SO2 allowances to meet\nthe plant needs. The plant uses no scrubber.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLocation\n\n\u00b7 The Boardman plant is located in north central Oregon, approximately\n13 miles southwest of Boardman in Morrow County, about 160 miles east of Portland\nand 11 miles south of the Columbia River.\n\n\u00b7 The Boardman area was a good choice for the plant site because its\nsparse population provides a congestion-free setting for a large industrial\noperation.\n\nSite Certification agreement March 24, 1975.\nStart of on-site construction February1976.\nStart of coal deliveries January 1980\nFirst electricity generated July 12, 1980\nIn service August 3, 1980\nMain Boiler Upgraded June 1998\nLP Turbine Upgraded July 2000\n\nProject Costs\n\n$525 million\n\nArchitect\/Engineers\n\nBechtel Power Corp.\n\nArchitect engineer and construction management.\n\nSwan Wooster, Inc.\n\nCoal handling systems\n\nCambell Yost Grube\n\nAdministrative Warehouse Shop Building\n\nGenerating Electricity\n\nCoal Transportation\n\n\u00b7 Coal is delivered by 110-car trains, which travel from the mines\nto the plant about every 2 \u00be days. Each unit train can transport 11,500\ntons of coal per trip.\n\n\u00b7 Coal arriving at the plant is conveyed to the storage areas. At\nthe coal handling yard coal is received, unloaded, stored and sent to the\nmain power building for use in the boiler. The yard provides long-term storage\nfor up to two million tons of coal. At full capacity, there would be enough\ncoal stored there to fuel Boardman for nearly 9 months.\n\n\u00b7 In order to obtain maximum fuel efficiency and the cleanest combustion\npossible, the coal is first crushed into smaller pieces (less than \u00be\ninch in diameter) and then pulverized into dust as fine as talcum powder just\nbefore it is burned.\n\n\u00b7 It is then blown into the combustion chambers of the plant's\nboiler where it burns at temperatures reaching 3,000 \u00baF.\n\n\u00b7 The boiler fire heats approximately 90 miles of piping turning the\nwater inside to 1,000 \u00baF steam. This high-pressure steam is what turns\nthe turbine generator and produces electricity.\n\n\u00b7 As steam leaves the turbine, it is condensed to water as it passes\nthrough a system of coils filled with cooling water from Carty Reservoir.\nOnce condensed, the water is recycled back to the boiler and the heating process\nis repeated.\n\n\u00b7 Can be received by tank trucker or rail car\n\u00b7 On site storage tank: 450,000 gallons.\n\nPrecipitators Control Emissions\n\n\u00b7 Plant uses special particulate trapping equipment called \"electronic\nprecipitators\" to prevent ash particulates from escaping into the atmosphere.\n\n\u00b7 Portland General Electric (PGE) has invested more than $27.5 million\nin large electrostatic precipitators which capture more than 99.5% of the\nfly ash formed in the combustion process. Large fans draw combustion gases\nthrough the precipitators past electrically charged plates. The charged plates\nact like magnets and attract fly ash particles. As ash builds up on the plate\nsurfaces, the plates are shaken to loosen the ash particles, which fall to\nhoppers located beneath the plates.\n\n\u00b7 Not all residual ash is disposed of. It is also used as an additive\nin concrete and road construction materials. Bottom ash, which falls to the\nbottom of the boiler and represents approximately 20% of the ash produced\nof the plant, is often used as a soil fill to prevent erosion. Both the fly\nash and bottom ash are trucked to wither a by-product user or to an on-site\nash disposal area.\n\nChimney\n\n\u00b7 The 656-foot chimney, Oregon's tallest man-made structure,\nis 48 feet in diameter at the base and 30 feet in diameter at the top. Inside\nthe chimney is a 22-foot-diameter steel liner that directs gases upward through\nthe chimney opening.\n\nWater Supply\n\n\u00b7 Cooling water needed by the plant comes from Carty Reservoir, a\n1,450-acre (at full capacity) cooling pond with a maximum depth of about 80\nfeet. A divider dike through the center of the reservoir circulates and dissipates\nwarm water discharged from the plant. An intake structure draws water from\nthe reservoir to cool the main condenser on the turbine generator, and provides\nplant fire protection. It contains circulating water pumps and service water\npumps, which supply the plant's auxiliary systems.\n\n\u00b7 The reservoir eliminates the need for cooling water from natural\nstreams or rivers and\nthus avoids discharge that might impact fish and wildlife. The reservoir also\nacts as a wildlife reservoir and irrigation source for the local community.\n\nWater Treatment (Feedwater System)\n\n\u00b7 Raw water pretreatment is accomplished by using bag filters coated\nwith diatomaceous\nearth. High purity demineralized water is supplied by one of two makeup\ndemineralizer system trains that utilize an activated carbon filter; cation\nand\nanion exchange vessels, and a mixed bed vessel. Capacity of one train: 350\ngpm.\n\n\u00b7 Dissolved and suspended solids are removed from the condensate by\na full flow polishing system that utilizes mixed-bed cation-anion exchange\nresin vessels. Capacity: 7000 gpm.\n\nA Good Neighbor\n\n\u00b7 PGE uses several dust suppressors (sprinklers that spray water,\nfoam or other liquids) near coal transfer points to lessen the amount of coal\ndust that would normally blow across the desert.\n\n\u00b7 PGE also operates a liquid waste management program to ensure that\nwaste water is safe\nfor the environment.\n\n\u00b7 Boardman is a recipient of the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition\nProgram (SHARP) and Oregon Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) award for\nsafety.\n\nPros and Cons of Coal\n\n\u00b7 Coal provides about 22% of the world's commercial energy (and\n22% in the United States). It is used to generate 62% of the world's\nelectricity and to make 75% of its steel. In the United States, coal is burned\nto generate about 52% of the country's electricity.\n\n\u00b7 Coal is the world's most abundant fossil fuel. Identified\nworld reserves of coal should last at least 225 years at the current usage\nrate, and 65 years if usage rises 2% per year. The world's unidentified\ncoal reserves are projected to last about 900 years at the current consumption\nrate and 149 years if the usage rate increases 2% per year. Thus, identified\nand unidentified supplies of coal could last the world for 965-1,125 years,\ndepending on the rate of usage.\n\n\u00b7 Coal is very abundant, but it has the highest environmental impact\nof any fossil fuel from:\n\n(1) land disturbance\n(2) air pollution\n(3) CO2 emissions (coal accounts for about 43% of the world's annual\nemissions)\n(4) Release of particles of mercury when burned\n(5) Release of thousands of times more radioactive particles into the atmosphere\nper unit of\nenergy produced than does a normally operating nuclear power plant\n(6) Water pollution\n\n\u00b7 Each year in the United States alone, air pollutants from coal burning:\n\n(1) kill thousands of people (with estimates ranging from 65,000 to 200,000)\n(2) cause at least 50,000 cases of respiratory disease\n(3) result in several billion dollars of property damage\n\n\u00b7 HOWEVER, new ways; such as fluidized-bed combustion, have been developed\nto burn coal more cleanly and efficiently and may be phases in over the next\nseveral decades."}
{"text":"Flight Attendants Lobby for Cleaner Air\n\nON THE MOVE \/ CAROL SMITH\n\nMay 26, 1994|CAROL SMITH | CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena\n\nOne of the perennial concerns of people who fly frequently has been the quality of the air they breathe in flight.\n\nFifteen years ago, most complaints centered on discomfort caused by dry air. Five years ago, the primary complaint was from breathing secondhand smoke, which led Congress in 1990 to ban smoking on all flights shorter than six hours.\n\nRecently, however, concerns have focused on environmental hazards, ranging from air pollutants to the risk of getting a communicable illness.\n\nIn testimony before Congress last week, Federal Aviation Administration officials supported recent studies showing that cabin air is healthful to breathe. However, the Assn. of Flight Attendants, a 33,000 member union, continues to press Congress for legislation to set higher standards for fresh air in planes.\n\nThe union argues that fresh air contains fewer contaminants, including airborne viruses and bacteria, than does recirculated air. In addition, the group believes that by changing the air in the plane more frequently, the risk of disease-causing organisms or fumes being inhaled by passengers will be reduced.\n\n*\n\nToward that end, Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) have introduced a bill that would set a standard for the amount of fresh air reaching passengers and crew in the cabin, as well as establish a toll-free phone number for reporting air quality problems.\n\n\"There are currently no federal minimum standards for the amount of fresh air\" in aircraft cabins, said Chris Witkowski, a spokesman for the Assn. of Flight Attendants. However, there are standards for the cockpit, where pilots are required to be alert at all times, he said.\n\nThe increased attention to air quality is due in part to a change in the way newer aircraft ventilate their cabins, said David Stempler, executive director of the International Airline Passengers Assn., a Washington-based group that represents 110,000 passengers. Aircraft built at least 15 years ago circulate 100% fresh air throughout the cabin, whereas newer ones use a combination of fresh and recycled cabin air.\n\nThis change, along with a reduction in the number of times the air in the cabin is replaced with fresh air, has raised concerns that the level of contaminants in aircraft air is higher than it was before.\n\n*\n\nThe Assn. of Flight Attendants said anecdotal evidence of crew members' symptoms--such as dizziness, headaches, nausea and feelings of disorientation--has been increasing, although the union has not officially tracked the number of complaints.\n\nBecause of such complaints, the FAA and the airline industry have mounted several studies over the past five years to look at air quality on aircraft.\n\n*\n\nMost recently, for example, the Air Transport Assn., a Washington-based trade organization that represents airlines, released the results of its \"Airline Cabin Air Quality Study.\" The study, conducted by independent testing agency Consolidated Safety Services Inc., sampled air on 35 flights of various lengths on eight major airlines.\n\nSampling took place on four types of aircraft, both newer and older models. The tests measured carbon dioxide, temperature, relative humidity, noise, volatile organic compounds and particulates. The company also took samples to identify bacterial and fungal contaminants.\n\nResults showed that \"levels of contaminants found in airline cabins are not likely to cause adverse health effects\" and that \"both generations of aircraft exceed the requirements for maintaining a healthy air quality environment.\"\n\n*\n\nIn addition, the study found that levels of carbon dioxide, a byproduct of breathing that can cause symptoms such as lethargy, dizziness and rapid heart rate at high concentrations, were lower than those found in other indoor settings, such as shopping malls or office buildings.\n\nIn his recent testimony before Congress, Jon Jordan, the federal air surgeon for the FAA, reviewed results of that study and two other reports--a 1989 study conducted for the FAA and the Department of Transportation and a 1991 study conducted by the National Institutes of Occupational Safety and Health. They also found that levels of airborne contaminants and other pollutants were beneath federal guidelines.\n\nThe FAA therefore believes that current ventilation systems maintain healthful air on planes, said Hank Verbais, a spokesman for the FAA's Western Pacific Region.\n\nStill, the perception that the air in the enclosed space of an airliner contains unhealthful levels of particulates and other compounds remains. The Assn. of Flight Attendants believes it is a safety issue, because the safety of passengers depends on flight attendants functioning without impairment in an emergency. And the FAA continues to get calls from concerned passengers. The Airline Passengers Assn., however, said it is no longer a major issue for its members.\n\n*\n\nA more alarming issue for passengers who fly overseas is the practice at some international airports of using pesticides to decontaminate planes, Stempler said. Fear of introducing insects that could damage crops is the motivation, but the practice, which the Airline Passengers Assn. is currently investigating, has raised health concerns among its members."}
{"text":"EPA on Fracking\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued new fracking regulations. This directly impacts the health of those living near fracking sites, many of whom are rural residents.\n\nHydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a method to harvest natural gas. Chemicals are shot underground to break up rocks, releasing embedded gas. Residents living near fracking sites have reported polluted groundwater and other health dangers.\n\nThe new regulations target air pollution. Specifically, when the underground gas rises to the Earth's surface, it tends to \"flare\" up before being collected.\n\nImagine a burst fire hydrant. The water surges out of the ground, until someone shuts the valve. Most of the water is conserved, but that initial squirt is lost.\n\nNatural gas acts in a similar way. Usually, the initial flare up is just absorbed into the atmosphere. And natural gas, or methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nThe EPA has focused on minimizing the air-pollution effects of fracking. The new regulations compel frackers to capture the methane at the source, instead of letting it slip away.\n\nThe biggest benefactors are the people living near natural gas wells. Methane (and other toxic releases) from fracking can cause irreparable harm to humans. On a grander scale, minimizing air-pollution serves us all.\n\nBut gas companies will benefit from these regulations too. Methane collected from flare-ups can be sold to consumers like normal. In fact, its estimated that the industry will save $11 to $19 Million per year by following these rules. Most companies haven't installed collectors because of the initial costs involved. The EPA ruling removes this roadblock.\n\nThe standards go into effect in 60 days, but companies have three years to comply. Beginning in 2015, all companies must capture methane. The sooner they install capturing technologies, the better.\n\nThe new EPA regulations don't address all the health concerns of fracking.\n\nBut they're a good start, for both the people living near the wells, and the companies that profit."}
{"text":"Article: Ozone in the Workplace\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nBecause of its powerful antibacterial activity,\nozone gas is used industrially most often as a\ndisinfectant. But it may also be created as a by-product\nof other processes. Ozone occurs naturally outdoors\nthrough the interaction of oxygen (which makes up 20% of\nthe air we breathe) with sunlight. It is in the\nultraviolet portion of the sunlight spectrum -\nparticularly a certain wavelength of ultraviolet - that\ncauses oxygen (O2) to convert to ozone (O3). Since\noxygen, in air, is everywhere, it takes only a source of\nultraviolet light of this frequency to produce ozone. It\nis also produced when oxygen passes through high voltage\nAC discharge. So ozone can be easily generated using\nspecially made ultraviolet lights and air or oxygen. And\nit is also a by-product of many processes where\nultraviolet light is used or present.\n\nINDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS WHERE OZONE IS A\nPROBLEM\n\nOzone is not just present in the aforementioned\nways it is produced, stored in steel or glass bottles,\nand used in chemicals manufacturing. Because ozone is\nimmediately made whenever ultraviolet light of the proper\nfrequency is shined in air, there are many industrial\nsituations where ozone is created. Many people are\nfamiliar with the odor produced around visible electrical\nsparks; this is the smell of ozone, and ozone is present\nwherever open sparking occurs.\n\nOzone, once created, may rapidly dissipate when it\ncomes into contact with surfaces and breaks down. Be\naware that ozone, once created, may sometimes drift\nthrough the air for long distances, so that if it is not\ndiluted by fresh air, a hazard may exist far from the\npoint of ozone generation. Electric arc\nwelding-particularly gas shielded inert gas \"TIG\" welding\non aluminum - is a common process creating ozone as a\nby-product, and arc welders are at risk of suffering\nsevere lung injury if they work in areas that have\ninadequate ventilation.\n\nArc welding is considered to be the highest-risk\noccupation because of the high levels of ozone that may\nbe unintentionally generated. Corona devices on photocopy\nmachines allso create small amounts of ozone, although\nsingle machines operating properly do not produce\nsufficient ozone to create a health hazard. But there are\nmany other industries where ozone is, intentionally or\nunintentionally, produced. Ozone generating ultraviolet\nlights are made for purifying drinking water and water\nfor swimming pools, hot tubs and spas. Ozone is used as a\ndisinfectant for stored food, animal by products, and\nsewage.\n\nIt is used as a bleaching agent for bleaching textiles\nand paper pulp. And the manufacture and testing of the\nultraviolet lights used to make ozone may itself create\nhazardous levels of ozone.\n\nHEALTH HAZARDS\n\nOzone is a colorless invisible gas with a mild\nodor similar to chlorine bleach. Even in small amounts it\nis one of the most potently toxic substances known to the\nlungs. While we all breathe very small amounts of ozone\nin outdoor air-usually without harm to our\nlungs-situations in which the level of ozone in air is\nincreased may lead to short term injury or long-term lung\ndamage.\n\nUnfortunately, you can breathe enough ozone to do\nserious damage to the lungs in a short period of time -\nseconds to minutes - and without being aware of the\nexposure, if the levels in air are high enough. And the\nsymptoms that result from breathing th ozone may be\ndelayed for minutes to hours after the exposure occurs.\nIn addition, your sense of smell 'adapts' to ozone\nrapidly, so that you may smell it when you first walk\ninto a room, but soon become entirely unaware of its\npresence.\n\nThe most frequent effect of overexposure is an episode\nof cough accompanied by a sense of chest tightness of\npain on deep respiration. The cough may last for hours to\ndays. More severe overexposure may result in additional\npersistent coughing and severe shortness of breath. If\nyou think you may have been exposed to high levels of\nozone, you should seek medical attention.\n\nEXPLANATION OF OSHA REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe federal Occupational Safety and Health\nadministration regulates the maximum level of ozone\npermitted in workplace air in the same way that other\ntoxic substances in the workplace are regulated.\nViolation of the OSHA standard makes the employer liable\nto fines for noncompliance with standards.\n\nThe OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) is 0.1 part\nper million parts of air (0.2 milligrams per cubic meter\nof air), averaged over an eight hour workday. This level\nis comparable to outdoor levels that occasionally occur\nin areas of the country with higher ozone concentrations.\nOne hundred times this level, 10 parts per million, is\nconsidered Immediately Dangerous to Life, requiring\nurgent evacuation of the area.\n\nEven a brief exposure at this level may lead to\nserious and irreversible lung damage. State Occupational\nSafety and Health programs must meet or improve upon\nthese protective levels. For temporary situations where\nthe ozone level exceeds the PEL, OSHA recommends\nspecific, fresh-air supplying mask respirators to protect\nthe lungs. Use of mask respirators is meant only for\ntemporary or emergency situations where control of ozone\nlevels in air is not possible.\n\nUse of such respirators in the workplace requires\nfirst measuring ozone levels in air to know which design\nof respirator to use; individual fit testing of each\nperson who will use a respirator; and designating a\nprogram maintenance director who will be in charge of\nstoring respirators between use and keeping respirators\nin proper operating condition."}

Because what it's doing when you absorb it into your body, is it's competing with oxygen for haemoglobin. Haemoglobin runs through our blood and it carries oxygen to the brain, to the muscles, to the nerves. Carbon monoxide has oxygen on it, and sort of, to haemoglobin, looks a little bit like oxygen. The problem is that carbon monoxide has a much higher affinity for haemoglobin than oxygen does, so it displaces oxygen off of haemoglobin, and it robs your tissues of oxygen.\n\nIs carbon monoxide poisonous?\n\nCarbon Monoxide is an insidious killer. It came to light when a famous tennis star Vetas Gerulaitis suddenly died at the heart of his career in a Queens home when he was staying over night with some friends and he didn't wake up the next morning sleeping in the basement because the home didn't have a carbon monoxide detector and it had a furnace malfunction carbon monoxide backed up into the basement and he died in his sleep.\n\nWhat are the sources of carbon monoxide poisoning in the home?\n\nAny combustion appliance in your home can be a source of Carbon Monoxide, from your furnace, to a kerosene heater, to a car running in an attached garage. All these appliances will release some Carbon Monoxide. It's important that they all be vented to the outside."}
{"text":"Q. What exactly is Project New Ground?\nA. Project New Ground is a long-term cleanup project that resulted from an agreement between the City of Jacksonville and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The agreement calls for the city to clean up the properties on which ash from waste-burning incinerators was deposited.\n\nQ. Why is health a concern? A. Ash that was deposited in various parts of our city may cause health concerns for some residents today. Testing in the 1980s and 1990s revealed that some of the ash contained elevated levels of lead and could create potential public-health issues. According to tests conducted by the Duval County Health Department, no unusual levels of lead have been found in children who have been tested.\n\nThe Duval County Health Department has determined that health concerns are limited to children under the age of six. Project New Ground will reduce any potential threat to children by cleaning up the property and limiting future exposure.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about how ash on your property may affect your health, please contact the health department at (904) 253-1000. You may also visit the Duval County Health Department website, \n\nQ. Why is the health of children especially important?\nA. Children under the age of 6 are more vulnerable to elevated levels of lead than adults are. However, blood levels of lead among children tested in the Project New Ground areas were not found to be significantly elevated and are comparable to lead levels found throughout the county. Between August 1999 and April 2000, 349 area children were screened. Just five of them (1.4 percent) were found to have elevated levels of lead. And for two of those five children, the sources of the problem were traced back to the interiors of their homes. For the other three children, the sources could not be assessed. To have your child tested for lead, please contact your family physician or the Duval County Health Department.\n\nQ. Is the area's drinking water safe? A. Yes. The quality of drinking water in neighborhoods surrounding area ash sites has been closely monitored since 1974. No contamination from ash sites has been detected in city water or private potable water wells. If you would like your well water tested, please call the Duval County Health Department at (904) 253-1282 to schedule an appointment. For utility water testing, contact the Florida Department of Environmental Protection at (904) 807-3300.\n\nQ. How can we be sure the health-improvement goals of Project New Ground will be met?\nA. Project New Ground will meet or exceed the strictest standards set by both the federal and state governments. These standards will help protect our children, which is the major goal of Project New Ground.\n\nAll work requires review and approval by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Region 4) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nQ. What will happen during the cleanup?\nA. Highly experienced companies who contract with the city will remove up to two feet of soil from the properties that have been tested and shown to contain ash. Then, the old soil will be replaced by clean soil that will be taken from a site that is certified as safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nIf your property requires cleanup, a city contractor will prepare an individual plan especially for your site and will show it to you before any work begins.\n\n1. Your soil will be tested.\n\n2. If ash is found, up to two feet of soil will be removed and replaced with clean soil.\n\nQ. How does the city know which properties need to be cleaned up? A. Each parcel within Project New Ground needs to be scientifically tested to see if it contains substances that may pose health concerns. But before testing takes place, property owners must give the city and its contractors permission to enter their property.\nAbout 60 percent of the properties have been tested. If your property has not been tested, please contact us or click here to download an access agreement.\n\nQ. How long will Project New Ground take? A. Because Project New Ground is such extensive project, it will not be finished overnight. Completing the job for all sites will take several years, and plans call for work to continue through about 2013.\n\nQ. If my property needs to be cleaned up, will I be able to remain in my home during the cleanup process?\nA. Yes. Cleanup on each property should take five days or less. During that time, you are welcome to remain in your home. If you prefer to leave your property during the cleanup, the city will provide temporary housing at no cost to you. To make the cleanup more efficient and convenient for residents, work on each property will be completed before moving on to the next property.\n\nQ. Do residents need to give permission for the cleanup work to be performed? A. Yes. The city needs the property owner's permission to test the soil, and, if needed, clean it up. In order to give permission, residents must sign an access agreement before any city contractor begins work on the property. If the property needs to be cleaned up, residents will be contacted to discuss a timeline, and a pre-cleanup survey will be done.\n\nQ. Will removal of the soil create any health concerns?\nA. The contractors removing the soil are highly trained in containing and managing all the soil. There is no reason to believe that exposure to the soil during removal poses any health concerns. Throughout the process, dirt and dust will be minimized and controlled. Water trucks will control dust, and streets will be swept clean. Dump trucks will be cleaned before leaving worksites.\n\nQ. Will Project New Ground cost residents any money? A. No. The city is responsible for the cost of Project New Ground. Homeowners will also keep all legal rights to their properties, just as they do now. If any damage is done to the property during the cleanup, it will be repaired by the city.\n\nQ. What will happen to the soil that is removed from the Project New Ground areas? A. The soil that is removed will be stored in a nearby, safe, controlled area for further testing before being transported to Trail Ridge Landfill.\n\nQ. What will my property look like after cleanup?\nA. Every property included in Project New Ground will be covered with up to two feet of clean fill soil. In addition, the properties will be attractively landscaped with sod. In areas where it is practical, drainage will also be improved during the cleanup process.\n\nQ. Who will be doing the actual cleanup work? A. All work will be done by competent contractors who are highly qualified and experienced in this field. Workers will be specially trained to perform their tasks. In addition, the qualifications for contractors\u2014as well as design specifications and legal documentation\u2014will be available through city records and at the Project New Ground information center.\n\nEleven engineering\/construction firms have been prequalified to bid for the work, and the finalists have already been approved by both the city and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The winning contractor will be selected from these firms. At least one local firm will be a part of the engineering\/construction team involved, and they will be strongly encouraged to hire local laborers, including minorities.\n\nAfter the work is completed, residents will be able to take part in customer-satisfaction surveys, and incentives will be given to those companies that achieve the highest levels of satisfaction. This means the contractors will work hard to make sure property owners are happy with both the process and the results. If contractors do not perform the work in a satisfactory way, their contracts will be ended. To further assure quality of work, each property will be videotaped before, during and after cleanup.\n\nQ. How will property owners be involved in Project New Ground? A. Property owners and residents will be kept informed before, during and after the cleanup. The Project New Ground information center will be open to all and will be located in an area that is convenient for residents.\nIn addition, public information fairs will be held to inform residents about Project New Ground. The city will also communicate through various other means, including mailings, posters, flyers and in-person visits to homes. This website will also be kept up-to-date with the latest news.\n\nQ. How can residents be assured that Project New Ground will make the community better? A. A Technical Assistance Grant (TAG) will be available for community groups to hire a technical advisor of their own choosing. That advisor may review the project on behalf of the community and report any findings to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nQ. How much will the cleanup effort cost?\nA. The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated the cost of the cleanup to be about $98.4 million. This will be paid for by the city, and no property owner will pay directly for the cleanup.\n\nQ. Have any other communities dealt with a similar situation? A. Yes. In fact, the City of Jacksonville has closely studied the cleanup of ash sites in Omaha, Neb., and Anniston, Ala. The experiences of those cities have been incorporated into a set of best practices to be used in Jacksonville's Project New Ground.\n\nQ. How can residents stay informed about Project New Ground? A. Your participation is key to the success of Project New Ground, and the city is making a strong effort to keep people informed. The city is sending out initial letters to residents that will be followed by regular updates as well as face-to-face discussions with residents in the Project New Ground areas.\n\nIn addition, the city operates a centrally located information center for your convenience. The city encourages you to visit the Project New Ground outreach coordinators at the information center for complete assistance with any questions or concerns you may have about Project New Ground.\n\nQ. Who can I contact for more information?\nA. Project New Ground is eager to answer your questions and help you in any way during the cleanup. Please feel free to contact the information center at (904) 357-8077.\n\nQ: What is the procedure for excavation near building foundations? A: Hand excavation will be conducted to a maximum depth of 3-6 inches for a limited distance, and then normal excavation depths can be resumed with mechanical equipment.\n\nQ: Do fruits and vegetables grown in contaminated soil pose a health risk? A: Per the CDC, eating fruits and vegetables grown in contaminated soil rarely provides enough intake to pose a health risk. Studies have found more pollution in leafy vegetables and root crops (carrots, potatoes, lettuce and greens), than fruiting plant produce (fruit trees, tomatoes, and peas and beans). It is best to wash hands and all vegetables thoroughly before eating and peel root crops, such as potatoes and carrots.\n\nAs added precaution, residents can grow vegetables or other edible plants in containers or raised-bed gardens."}

To improve indoor air quality, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends (1) controlling the sources of pollution and (2) cleaning indoor air.\n\nAvoidance of allergens (controlling sources of pollution) is the best way to prevent allergic reactions:\n\nAvoid Pet Dander - Remove pets from the home or at least from the bedroom.\n\nAvoid Mold Spores - Take care of water leaks and sources of moisture in your home immediately and keep humidity below 45-50%.\n\nAvoid Dust Mite Allergen - Encase mattresses, box springs, and pillows in zippered mite proof covers (the single most important method of dust mite allergen avoidance according to the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology [AAAAI]), replace carpet with hard surface floors, keep relative humidity below 45-50%, and wash uncovered bedding, curtains, and stuffed animals every week or two in very hot water.\n\nTo further reduce exposure to allergens, use measures to clean the indoor air such as:\n\nHEPA Room Air Cleaners - HEPA stands for high efficiency particulate air and the Asthma & Allergy Foundation Of America (AAFA) explains that \"to qualify as a true HEPA filter, it must be able to capture at least 99.97% percent of all particles 0.3 microns in diameter, or larger, that enter it.\" When purchasing an air cleaner, consider these points:\n\nIs the filtration True HEPA, not HEPA-like?\n\nHow easy is it to change the filters?\n\nWhat is the annual cost of operation (energy consumption and filter replacement)?\n\nWhat size air cleaner is needed for the room?\n\nWhat is the noise level of the air cleaner?\n\nIs this air cleaner an ozone generator that produces unacceptable levels of ozone?\n\nWhole House Filtration Methods - Allergen reduction furnace filters capture particles in your home's air when the HVAC fan pulls the air through the filter while filters for HVAC vents trap particles coming through the ductwork.\n\nHEPA Vacuum Cleaners - Just like air cleaners, the filter in a vacuum cleaner must capture at least 99.97% of all particles 0.3 microns in diameter, or larger, that enter it. Having a vacuum with a HEPA filter means particles that pass through the vacuum bag are trapped in the filter instead of escaping back into the room through the vacuum motor's exhaust. Many allergen particles settle to the floor and frequent vacuuming is recommended.\n\nDust Reduction Tools - Dust contains allergen particles and needs to be removed frequently. The right tools make the job easier. Dusting will stir up particles from surfaces so wear a dust mask while doing housework.\n\nAccording to the AAFA, \"by avoiding or reducing your contact with indoor allergens, you may be able to:\n\nReduce your allergy symptoms and feel much better.\n\nManage your allergy symptoms without medicine or with fewer medicines.\n\n2. Keep nasal and sinus passages free of irritants. In addition to avoiding allergens and cleaning your home's air, you can be healthier in 2011 by using nasal irrigation, sometimes called sinus irrigation or nasal washing. This proven non-drug method of treating allergy and sinus symptoms is also a great preventative measure. According to the AAAAI:\n\nSaline sinus rinses can often bring relief to patients with chronic sinus or rhinitis problems without the use of medication. Often, people with chronic or acute sinus infections produce excessive mucus and sinus rinses are helpful to remove and thin out secretions. Several different commercial sinus rinse devices are effective and available without prescription; patients should choose a product based on their personal preference. Saline sinus rinses may also rinse out allergens, irritants, and germs and remove possible triggers that bother people with sinus and rhinitis problems.\n\nThere are two main methods of nasal\/sinus Also, in the positive pressure category are mechanized methods of irrigation that send pulsing streams of water into your nose and sinuses in a motion that mimics the natural motion of the nasal cilia. All of these positive pressure devices are both gentle and effective.\n\nAlthough some people find nasal irrigation a little awkward at first, the benefits are so great that they stick with it and soon become accustomed to the procedure. Dr. Rabago of the University of Michigan Medical School has conducted four studies on nasal irrigation over a seven year period. He concluded that \"people with chronic sinus symptoms who consistently practiced nasal irrigation reported a decrease in symptoms (congestion, runny nose), an increased quality of life and a reduced use of [prescription] nasal sprays and antibiotics.\"\n\n3. Reduce dangerous fumes with low-chemical or plant-based household cleaners. Part of staying healthy is maintaining a clean, healthy environment while exposing ourselves, our children, and the planet to the least toxic chemicals possible. Since the more you are exposed to chemicals, the more likely it is that those chemicals will lead to allergy or asthma flare-ups, it just makes sense to reduce exposure to chemicals when possible. Using low chemical or plant-based household cleaners for regular cleaning, even if stronger chemicals must occasionally be used for tough jobs, can be beneficial to your health and that of your family.\n\nThere are some tactics you can employ to look for the best choices and avoid the worst offenders:\n\nAvoid petroleum-based (ingredients with prefixes or suffixes like propyl-, methyl-, eth-, -ene are usually petroleum-based.), and choose plant-based or vegetable-based products.\n\nChoose biodegradable products. The FTC says a product can be called biodegradable if it will \"break down and decompose into elements found in nature within a reasonably short amount of time when they are exposed to air, moisture and bacteria or other organisms\".\n\nSave 15% On Products For A Healthier New Year When You Use This Month's Promo Code\n\nMargie Bullock, Newsletter Editor\n\nClosing Thoughts Why is it so hard to make even small changes that would make us feel better?

{"text":"According to the US Census Bureau, there are over 95,000 public schools in the US. They vary widely in number, average age, and socio-economic status of the students they serve. However, one thing is certain \u2013 the quality of the air that students breathe day-in and day-out affects their performance, their health, and their development. According to the US General Accounting Office, 14 million students (over a quarter of all students) attend schools considered below standard or dangerous, and the air in nearly 15 thousand US schools is unfit to breathe.\n\nWith facilities including gyms, locker rooms, chemistry labs, swimming pools, woods and metals shops, and cafeterias, schools provide a much wider variety of possible indoor air quality problems than typical adult workplaces. Since the '70s, education professionals have had to remediate specific indoor air quality problems, but have rarely taken a holistic approach to improving the overall health of students. For example, schools have been diligent about addressing radon and asbestos, but infrequently considered the effect that conditions such as sealed windows have on student and staff health.\n\nAdministrators and educators are increasingly aware of the need to maintain a healthy indoor environment. And, according to a national 2007 survey published in the Journal of School Health, more than half of US states currently provide funding for improved indoor air quality.\n\nFirst, let's consider the impact that indoor air can have on schools \u2013 and the children they serve. A 2005 survey of current research by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that \"\u2026higher indoor concentrations of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) have reduced school attendance, and\u2026low ventilation rates have been linked to reduced performance.\" The same study, conducted by M.J. Mendell and G.A. Heath, goes on to say that \"evidence suggests that poor air quality in schools is common and adversely influences the performance and attendance of students, primarily through health effects from indoor pollutants.\"\n\nAnother factor to be considered is that healthy spaces can reduce environment-related illnesses, including a reduction of between 9 and 20 in cases per year of the common cold, according to a 2000 study by William J. Fisk of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. Reductions in the spread of communicable diseases will reduce absenteeism and time lost in the classroom. A 2005 study by Palatino & Company found that improved indoor air conditions resulted in a 15% drop in absenteeism and, perhaps more importantly, a 5% improvement in students' test scores. A study of schools in the District of Columbia and the city of Chicago similarly reported a 3-4% improvement in schools' standardized test scores due to improvement indoor air quality conditions.\n\nThe advantages of clean indoor air in schools are clear, but how much will these practices cost school districts, many of whom already face significant budget challenges? The two options available to school districts \u2013 remediation and building new, green facilities \u2013 both carry costs, but those costs are ultimately outweighed by their advantages.\n\nOne common indoor air contaminant that can be simply remediated without significantly altering existing facilities is mold. Because of flooding in recent years, New Hampshire schools could be at an increased risk for mold, and the health effects should not to be taken lightly. Toxic black mold, which often affects buildings with flood damage, can cause lung disease, learning disabilities, and chronic fatigue syndrome. And a 1999 study by the Mayo Clinic demonstrated that nearly all chronic sinus infections are caused by toxic black mold. Less toxic (and more common) forms of mold can also have serious health effects. Mold has been cited as a factor in the 160% increase in rates of asthma among children under the age of five reported during the period from 1980-1994, including nine million children currently diagnosed with asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC also found that asthma alone caused 14.7 million lost school days in 2002.\n\nSchool districts have often faced mold problems for a number of reasons. The Environmental Protection Agency notes that increased mold in schools is often \"linked to changes in building construction practices during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Some of these changes have resulted in buildings that are tightly sealed, but may lack adequate ventilation, potentially leading to moisture buildup. Building materials, such as drywall, may not allow moisture to escape easily.\"\n\nThe good news is that mold infestations can usually be corrected by working with qualified environmental testing contractors. Properly identifying what needs to be done can be complicated, and hiring a properly trained indoor air quality (IAQ) expert is the best way to start.The process would typically begin with a mold inspection and indoor air quality audit to determine the amount of mold you have and at what levels it is circulating through the air. Samples will then have to be tested by an independent lab. \"Negative air machines,\" which filter out dirty air, may then be used to clean the existing indoor air. Air ducts and doors are sealed off to prevent the spread of airborne mold during the remediation process. During both the prep work and subsequent clean-up, technicians will wear helmets and other protective clothing and monitor changes in the IAQ. A certified industrial hygienist or other IAQ consultant will usually plan, manage and supervise this process. An IAQ expert will then propose ways to assure that mold doesn't return, which may include increasing ventilation, improving filtration, or rerouting drainage to stop moisture from invading vulnerable areas. An experienced IAQ consultant can provide advice on how to make these facility modifications as inexpensively and efficiently as possible.\n\nIndoor air quality professionals can also help build healthy environments when school districts build new facilities \u2013 and keep costs down. Author David Gottfried, in his study Sustainable Building Technical Manual: Green Building Design, Construction, and Operation, estimates that initial construction accounts for only about 2% of a project's overall cost, with operations and maintenance accounting for 6%. Green building, however, can significantly reduce operations and maintenance costs. For example, a 2003 study conducted by Gregory Kats demonstrates that green buildings can reduce energy consumption by 25-30% on average. Further, an October 2006 study conducted by Kats for the US Green Building Council, the American Federation of Teachers, the American Lung Association, and the Federation of American Scientists, persuasively argues that between utility costs, reductions in costs related to flu, colds, and asthma, and employee recruitment and retention, green schools can achieve savings of over 20 times the costs of building green. Green building, while sometimes thought to be more expensive than traditional building methods, easily recoups the investment over time.\n\nSchool districts have, however, been slow in making improved IAQ, green practices, and green building options a priority. Of the nine buildings recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council as LEEDs (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System) certified in New Hampshire, only 2 are schools serving K-12 students. Frustrating statistics such as these should not leave school administrators discouraged, however; any steps taken to improve the health of students and faculty are imperative to the ultimate goal of getting all New Hampshire schools to go green.\n\nScott H.

{"text":"Apr. 22, 2003 \u2014 HOUSTON, April 21, 2003 -- Air quality researchers at Rice University in Houston have completed the first detailed study that attempts to apportion the fine particulate matter measured in the city's smog to their sources of origin.\n\nShare This:\n\nThe researchers found that diesel engines are the primary contributors of fine particles to Houston's air, followed by gasoline-powered vehicles and road dust. Smoke particles from wood burning and fatty acids from meat grilling contributed considerably smaller but nonetheless significant amounts of the particulates in Houston's air.\n\n\"There's been a good deal of speculation about the relative contribution of various sources to the particulate matter in air pollution,\" said lead researcher Matthew P. Fraser, assistant professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice University. \"With this study, we're helping build a scientific body of evidence that policymakers and regulators can use to focus attention on the most significant contributors.\"\n\nThe findings from the Houston study will be published in the May 15 issue of the journal Atmospheric Environment.\n\nThe data in the study, a composite of seasonal samples representing a total of four months of records, were collected in 1997-1998 at four locations in the greater Houston-Galveston area. One site, located on Galveston Island, served as a background site because it is commonly upwind of the Houston metropolitan area, with typical winds off the Gulf of Mexico. Of the other sites, one was in a northwestern suburb and two were located near the petrochemical complexes along the Houston Ship Channel.\n\nCollaborators at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nev., analyzed each air sample by quantifying the major chemical components making up the fine particles. At Rice, researchers measured individual organic compounds that have been linked to specific sources of air pollution like smokestack emissions or diesel exhaust. By analyzing the amount of these markers in each sample and comparing them to source emissions records, Fraser and graduate students Birnur Buzcu and David Yue were able to determine the precise proportion of particulate matter produced by each source.\n\nThe study is part of ongoing national effort to better characterize and understand the sources of fine particles in the atmosphere. Compared to gas pollutants like carbon dioxide and ozone, relatively little research has been conducted in the area of airborne particulates. Air quality researchers want to know more because a growing body of medical evidence suggests that exposure to fine particulate matter can cause serious health problems.\n\nThe source apportionment of fine particles did not focus on ammonium sulfate -- a byproduct of large scale, industrial fossil fuel combustion. As the largest single component of particulate matter -- accounting for some 40 percent -- a number of previous studies have investigated the sources of ammonium sulfate. Instead, Fraser's team focused on less understood sources of fine particles like vehicle emissions.\n\nDiesel exhausts, which accounted for only 4 percent of particulates at the Galveston site, accounted for up to 17 percent at urbanized locations. Particulates from gasoline-powered vehicles, which also accounted for only 4 percent of the ambient particles in Galveston, accounted for up to 13 percent of particulates at urban locations.\n\nAt all but one location near the ship channel, road dust contributed fewer particulates than vehicle exhaust. At the suburban location, road dust was measured at just over one microgram per cubic meter. While this was 10 times the background level of road dust measured at Galveston, it was still less than less than half the mass of particles collected from diesel exhaust.\n\nThe study found that fuel oil combustion, a common practice at the industrial plants located along the ship channel, produced up to 1.5 micrograms of particulates per cubic meter at one location. These types of particles didn't register at all in the background sample.\n\n\"This is significant because it's the first time particulates from fuel oil combustion have been found in an apportionment study,\" said Fraser. \"The findings weren't unexpected, given the nature of industrial activity in the city, but they are indicative of an air quality pattern that may be unique to the city.\"\n\nFraser said air quality researchers working on apportionment studies for particulate matter in other U.S. metropolitan areas expect to find similar, \"signature\" patterns. Each pattern will reflect a mix of factors such as meteorology, population density and the city's industrial profile.\n\nThe apportionment study was sponsored by the American Chemistry Council's Atmospheric Chemistry Technical Implementation Panel. Sample collection and analysis were sponsored by the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, the Houston Regional Monitoring Corporation and the City of Houston."}

{"text":"Air Pollution\n\nTropospheric ozone and its precursors\n\nOzone in the troposphere, particularly near the surface, is harmful to humans and all of the Earth's ecosystems. Ozone in the troposphere is produced by photochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2 --> NOx). Carbon monoxide is an ozone precursor and a long-lived tracer of combustion. Generally, as NOx emissions increase, ozone pollution also rises, although when the ratio of VOCs to NOx is low, then reductions in VOCs will be effective in reducing ozone. Similarly, when the ratio of VOCs to NOx is high, VOC controls may be ineffective.\n\nOn the positive side, ozone reacts with water vapor and sunlight to form OH (the hydroxyl radical), which is known as the \"detergent\" molecule because it reacts with air pollutants and controls the atmosphere's capacity to cleanse itself. But on the other hand, ozone near the surface is toxic to plants and animals, including people. It is the source of photochemical smog, which is becoming a worldwide problem. And in the upper troposphere, ozone acts as a very efficient greenhouse gas.\n\nIt is difficult to determine how best to address the problem of ozone in the troposphere because the processes of ozone formation and destruction are exceedingly complex. The global distribution of ozone remains largely unknown and is greatly complicated by the troposphere's turbulent weather systems. TES is helping to fill this important knowledge gap.\n\nWhat are we learning from TES?\n\nAs part of the United States Clean Air Act, the EPA has defined the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six key air pollutants (ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, lead, and particulate matter) that are harmful to human health and the environment. The EPA sets the standards that states must meet for these pollutants; however it is up to each individual state to insure compliance. Many states perform extensive computer modeling of the air quality in their region and use the results from these models to develop strategies to comply with EPA standards. The states also rely on ozone measurements from surface monitor networks to verify the results from their models.\n\nTES routinely makes collocated measurements of ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and other atmospheric parameters that can be used as validation for the results from air quality models. Such data can also provide information about pollution transport from locations outside state boundaries into the state. This is how TES data can help improve the tools that provide information and develop compliance strategies, which are in turn used by policy makers to improve air quality. TES data can be applied in similar ways to studies of understanding the effects of different climate forcings and linkages between air quality and climate change. In these ways, TES data can help policy makers to identify practical actions and research activities that can improve air quality, slow the growth of climate forcings, and improve our understanding of the linkages between air quality and climate change.\n\nVisualization - Regional timetrend browse plots for ozone, carbon monoxide, methane, temperature and water vapor provide a quick way to understand trends. For example, during summer CO tends to be lower (due to higher OH abundance) and O3 tends to be higher (because more photolysis is taking place).\n\nTES participates in all of the Texas Air Quality studies, which provide opportunities to test the synthesis of chemistry and transport models such as the real-time air quality modeling system (RAQMS), which serves as a critical link between satellite and in situ observations. A case study (PDF, 951 KB) undertaken in August 2006, found that TES retrievals of CO and ozone vertical profiles, in conjunction with the RAQMS global model, provide a means of investigating the impact of distant sources on the background concentrations over Texas.\n\nTES monitors ammonia and methanol over Beijing\n\nTES is conducting Special Observations over Beijing throughout the 2008 Summer Olympic season. One such observation was conducted over the Beijing area in northeast China on July 10, 2007. This is the first time that ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH), have been detected by space-based nadir viewing measurements that penetrate into the lower atmosphere. A preliminary analysis of the TES spectra was conducted, and residual spectral radiances reveal surprisingly strong features attributable to enhanced concentrations of NH3 and CH3OH, well above the normal background levels. Very little is known about the regional and temporal variations of these molecules.\n\nAlthough ammonia and methanol are not highly correlated (plant growth is the source for methanol, whilst livestock and fertilizer are the sources for ammonia), the two pollutants were accompanied by high concentrations of both CO and O3 (up to 200 ppb). Since the burning of crop residues is common in this area and season, it is conjectured that the sources for both these molecules is local. (Methanol is an important chemical in the global budget of tropospheric O3, and deposition of ammonia is important because the formation of ammonium nitrate may be a significant source of aerosol formation and could play a significant role in atmospheric denitrification.)\n\nDemonstrating that TES data can be assimilated within atmospheric chemistry and transport models (using inverse modeling and chemical data assimilation techniques), TES CO profiles from November 2004 were ingested into a global three-dimensional (3-D) chemistry and transport model, GEOS-Chem. The TES CO data significantly improved the model simulation of CO in the middle to upper troposphere, along with assimilation of other trace gases, significantly improves the modeled distribution of CO in the southern hemisphere. Good agreement was found between TES assimilated model estimates of CO and in situ measurements. Assimilation of TES data can also help scientists assess the impact of initial conditions on the CO fields in the model.\n\nTES is the only remote-sensing instrument currently flying that can distinguish ozone at altitudes where it does harm from altitudes where it is beneficial, TES data can be uniquely valuable to local and regional air-pollution analysis and forecasting. The TES team is working with people at the EPA and with state air quality boards to use the satellite data to shed light on levels of ozone above the Earth's surface and away from surface monitors."}
{"text":"Pollution in the Netherlands\n\nDirty dikes\n\nThe green image of the Dutch is at odds with the reality\n\nON A cold morning, when the mist rises over the canals that criss-cross the countryside, spreading over the woods and flatlands, the Netherlands does not feel like a sink-hole of pollution. But the ice-encrusted water is brimming with nitrates and phosphates, and the air is clogged with particulate matter.\n\nThe country's poor environmental record is revealed in a report by Natuur & Milieu, an advocacy group. Rather than conduct its own measurements the group collected data from various official agencies. Its report shows the Dutch lagging behind their European peers for quality of air, soil and surface water, stuck in fossil-fuel dependency, and with exceptionally high carbon emissions.\n\nOn Yale University's Environmental Performance Index, the Netherlands comes 20th out of the 27 EU countries.* It scores particularly badly on the quality of its soil, where those phosphates and nitrates linger in large quantities. They seep into surface water, the quality of which is also below EU guidelines. Emissions of nitrogen monoxide and dioxide are triple the EU average. Carbon-dioxide emissions rose by 15% between 1990 and 2010. Only vast purchases of emission rights keep the Netherlands below its Kyoto targets.\n\nThere is broad agreement on the causes. The Netherlands has the highest numbers of livestock per head in Europe; these beasts produce unrecyclable amounts of manure that pollute soil and water. The country is a transport hub. Lorries and river barges use diesel, a source of particulates. The Dutch have many energy-hungry industries, such as refineries, steelworks and chemical plants. With not much land and lots of people, pollution looks inevitable.\n\nThe government does not dispute the report. Even the queen is concerned, referring in her Christmas speech to the limits of the earth's ability to sustain \"human greed\". Yet although it supports small environmental projects, the government does not seem worried about the big picture. In hard times it is not about to make life harder for industries that boost state coffers and supply jobs.\n\nAnyway, life in what some greens have dubbed \"Europe's drainage hole\" may not be so bad. The scary claim that particulate matter in the air knocks off 155,000 years of life amounts to just one month per person, says Pieter Boot of the Dutch planning bureau for the environment.

{"text":"Campaign Ramped up After Company Refuses to Stop Air Pollution Violations at the Pulliam Plant in Wisconsin\n\nCase Updates:\n\nOctober 2, 2005\n\nFollowing the launch of a local organizing campaign in July, Sierra Club has joined with coalition partner Clean Wisconsin to ratchet up pressure to protect local Green Bay communities. Although Wisconsin Public Service's (WPS) dirty coal-fired Pulliam power plant in northeastern Wisconsin has been spewing toxic air pollution into the region for decades, the company continues to deny the problem and refuses to embrace solutions such as adding affordable pollution control technology to the aging, 60 year-old facility. After uncovering years of air pollution violations, the two groups issued a warning letter to WPS in July. After WPS refused to take any steps to correct the ongoing violations, they had no other choice but to file a federal lawsuit to protect area residents.\n\nJuly 13, 2005\n\nFormer Green Bay Packer Jim Carter teamed up with local residents, Sierra Club, and Clean Wisconsin in early July to announce a legal campaign to clean up the highly polluting Pulliam coal plant operated by Wisconsin Public Service Corporation in Green Bay. The plant's oldest operating boiler was built in 1943 and does not have up-to-date pollution technologies to help reduce air pollution. The plant also has repeatedly violated clean air standards for particulate matter in the region, a type of pollution that is especially troublesome for people with asthma and other respiratory health concerns."}

Robinson and Neil M. Donahue report a new conceptual model for how microscopic particles behave in the atmosphere that raises new questions about current regulations.\n\nThe research found new chemical processes that occur after soot and gaseous pollutants are emitted from cars and trucks, changing the chemical and physical properties of the soot particles and creating new particulate matter. These new particles are potentially more toxic and may have a stronger influence on cloud formation that can alter the global climate.\n\n\"One of our key findings is that this chemical processing leads to more particulate matter in the air, meaning that regulators are likely underestimating how sources such as cars and trucks contribute to pollution,\" said Robinson, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy. \"We need to take a holistic approach to regulating these sources that account for all emissions.\" Accounting for these new processes improves the predictions of the models federal and state governments use to develop regulations.\n\n\"A second important finding is that the properties of this new particulate matter are different than we previously thought and potentially more toxic,\" added Donahue, an associate professor of chemical engineering and chemistry.\n\nParticulate matter poses a serious health problem.

{"text":"NOAA and University of Colorado scientists confirm that oil and gas well emissions add to ozone pollution\n\nEmissions from oil and natural gas operations north of Denver are releasing gases into the air that could add to ozone pollution in that region, according to a new study by researchers from the NOAA Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado and NOAA.\n\n\"At our test site in Weld County, we found that oil and natural gas operations are the dominant wintertime source of certain gases, called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), that act as precursors \u2014 starting ingredients \u2014 for ozone pollution,\" said lead author Jessica Gilman, Ph.D., a CIRES research chemist working at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colo.\n\nGilman's team found higher-than-expected levels of these gases, such as propane, in that area.\n\n\"Levels of propane were four to nine times higher than in large cities with documented air-quality problems, such as Houston or Pasadena,\" Gilman said.\n\nThe researchers originally went to the test site, the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory tower about 20 miles north of Denver, in winter 2011 to study nighttime air chemistry. \"The high concentrations of several of the VOCs surprised us,\" Gilman said.\n\nTo discover the source of the gases, Gilman's team analyzed more than 500 air samples, measuring dozens of different VOCs in each of the samples. That level of detail was crucial. It enabled them to determine that oil and natural gas activities were the primary source of those compounds and constituted 55 percent of the hydrocarbons that contribute to ozone formation in this area.\n\nA component of raw natural gas, VOCs such as propane and ethane can leak from pipes, valves, storage tanks, and from underground during oil and gas operations. VOCs can then react with other gases in the air to form lung-damaging ozone pollution, a chief component of smog.\n\nSince cars, vegetation, livestock, and other sources also emit VOCs, however, it wasn't initially clear how much of a role oil and gas wells played in the elevated VOC levels.\n\n\"When our first measurements came out, people would ask, \"How do you know the high level of pollutants is from natural gas? How do you know it's not from car exhaust, or cattle farms, or people's propane grills?' \" Gilman said. \"But we discovered that emissions from oil and natural gas activities have a unique 'chemical signature that's very different from emissions from other sources, and it definitively identifies oil and gas wells as the major source of the high levels of VOCs like ethane and propane.\"\n\nThe researchers uncovered that signature by analyzing the chemical makeup of all the air samples\u2014characterizing 53 different types of VOCs and comparing the results to the composition of raw natural gas.\n\n\"Each source has its own specific composition \u2014 cars look like one thing, trees like another, and so on,\" Gilman said. \"Just like your nose knows what a flower smells like, or coffee, or a farm, our instruments can 'smell and identify' oil and natural gas emissions. The signature is a very clear, robust marker.\"\n\nOnce in the air, the VOC emissions can react with sunlight and other gases (known as nitrogen oxides) to form ground-level ozone pollution. Like wood fuels a campfire, Gilman said, VOCs and nitrogen oxides together fuel the production of ozone pollution.\n\n\"What this study tells is us how much wood we have piled up there,\" she said. \"So in the wintertime at the tower site, oil and natural gas operations are the dominant source of ozone precursors.\"\n\nThe oil and gas footprint extends beyond Weld County, though. When the researchers took measurements near Fort Collins and in Boulder, north and west of the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory tower, they also detected emissions attributable to oil and natural gas there.\n\n\"Propane and ethane are fairly long-lived in the atmosphere, so they travel far,\" Gilman said. \"No matter where you are in the Front Range, you can still see the signature of VOC emissions from oil and natural gas operations.\"\n\nThat's important since parts of northeastern Colorado marginally exceed the EPA standards for ozone pollution.\n\nThe researchers next plan to measure the oil and gas emissions at BAO during summer, the season when other VOC sources such as vegetation and agriculture are likely more prominent, and also the time when ozone pollution is typically higher. They also will be looking at emissions in other states with high oil and gas production, such as Utah.\n\nThe results are relevant for people beyond those areas though. \"Sometimes people forget that we all live downwind of somebody,\" Gilman said.\n\nCoauthors on the study include CIRES\/NOAA scientists Brian Lerner, William Kuster, and Joost de Gouw. This research was funded by NOAA. CIRES is a joint institute of the University of Colorado Boulder and NOAA"}

For TVA that means finding ways\nto\nmake power for millions of homes, schools, farms, and\nbusinesses, and at the same time keep the environment clean and\nhealthy.\n\nWhere's\nthe dirt?\n\nElectricity\nlooks pretty clean, right? You flip a switch and a light goes\non. What's so messy about that? Well, it's the making\nof electricity that can create pollution. A significant portion of TVA's\npower is generated by the burning of coal.\nWhen coal burns, potentially dangerous chemicals like sulfur\ndioxide and nitrogen\noxides are released into the air. (Read information\nfrom the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency about air\nquality.)\n\nClearing\nthe air\n\nTo clean up the air while still providing everyone in the Tennessee Valley with electric power, TVA uses some pretty complex, expensive equipment.\n\nThrough 2011 TVA\nhas spent around $5.4 billion to control the release, or \"emission,\" of chemicals\nfrom its coal-burning power plants. To stay in compliance with future air quality regulations, TVA may spend another $3.4 billion by 2018.\n\nHere's some of what TVA has done so far:\n\nSulfur dioxides\n\nTo reduce sulfur dioxides, which are a component of acid rain, TVA has installed scrubbers on 17 of its coal-fired units and switched to lower-sulfur coals at 41 units. In August 2011, the TVA board of directors approved plans to install scrubbers on seven more coal-fired units.\n\nScrubbers mix powdered limestone with the hot gas that results from burning coal. This converts up to 95 percent of the sulfur dioxide to benefical byproducts like gypsum -- which is the main ingredient in the wall board that is used in the interior walls of many homes and offices.\n\nNitrogen oxides\n\nNitrogen oxides contribute to ground-level ozone and acid rain. To reduce nitrogen oxides, TVA has installed a variety of technologies on many of its coal-fired units, including selective catalytic\nreduction systems. These systems convert nitrogen oxides to harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor. TVA has installed them on 21 of its coal-fired units.\n\nTVA also has installed a variety of cleaner, more efficient combustion equipment on the majority of its coal-fired units to further reduce nitrogen oxides.\n\nParticulates\n\nParticulates are extremely small particles or droplets that result when fuels are burned. TVA has equipped all its coal-fired units with devices to reduce particulate emissions. These devices include electrostatic precipitators, similar to those in home air cleaners, that capture the particulates with static charges of electricity.\n\nAs a result of these and other actions, TVA has reduced its emissions of nitrogen oxides by 87 percent from their peak levels in 1995. And TVA has reduced its emissions of sulfure dioxides by 91 percent from their peak in 1977."}

Common pollutants inside our spaces, at the office, at school and at home are known cancer-causing toxins. Yes, that's right. This is pretty scary when you consider, according the EPA, that the typical American spends more than 90% of their time indoors, and that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to five times higher, and occasionally more than 100 times higher, than outdoor levels.\n\nCouple that with the fact that more than 30% of new and remodeled buildings worldwide may be the subject of excessive complaints related to indoor air quality (IAQ) according to the World Health Organization. With increases in asthma and growth in the number of chemical pollutants entering into our buildings, there is no doubt that we have a problem on our hands.\n\nWith a direct link between air quality within buildings and human health, comfort and well-being, the building design and construction industry has taken an active interest in mitigating problems as associated with poor indoor air quality, and physicians even treat those with Building Related Illness (BRI) and\/or Sick Building Syndrome (SBS).\n\nBuilding Related Illness\n\nWhen specific symptoms such as coughing, chest tightness, fever, chills and muscle aches can be attributed directly to building contaminants in airtight, poorly ventilated buildings, then Building Related Illness (BRI) can be clearly identified by a medical professional.\n\nSpecific BRIs are those for which a link between building-related exposure and illness can be proven. Specific examples include:\n\nNonspecific BRIs are those for which a link between building-related exposure and illness is more difficult to prove. Therefore, the term \"Sick Building Syndrome\" has been used to refer to illnesses that occur in clusters within a building and that often cause nonspecific symptoms.\n\nSick Building Syndrome\n\nThe term Sick Building Syndrome (SBS)\n\nSymptoms of Sick Building Syndrome may include:\n\nItchy, irritated, dry or watery eyes\n\nNasal congestion\n\nThroat soreness or tightness\n\nDry itchy skin or unexplained rashes\n\nHeadache, lethargy, or difficulty concentrating.\n\nSome building-related factors appear to account for symptoms in some instances. These factors include higher building temperature, higher humidity, and poor ventilation, typically with a failure to incorporate sufficient fresh air from outdoors and an introduction of a number of chemical pollutants and toxins into the space.\n\nBut Is It Really the Building Making Us Sick?\n\nSure, sure, I hear what you are saying. There are so many ways to get sick, how do you know if it's truly the building and its contents or other causes? What about people with acute chemical sensitivities or allergies? What about job related stress? Overall dissatisfaction? That jerky boss? Maybe the building is just exacerbating already existing conditions?\n\nWhat To Do If IAQ Problems Do Occur?\n\nOne key element in resolving IAQ problems is to identify problems and determine how serious they are and how difficult they may be to solve. Narrowing down possible sources of a problem can help you determine what type of help you need, and logging issues helps to identify patterns and resolving issues can reduce or eliminate liability. Follow these steps:\n\nTake notes and create a log:\n\nThe complaints or symptoms of building occupants\n\nHow many persons have problems or concerns\n\nWhere these occupants are located and their activities in the building\n\nWhen and how often the problems occur\n\nGeneral observations from the people in the building about the indoor environment.\n\nEncourage persons with specific medical problems to see their healthcare provider.\n\nGet Educated. Learn what creates indoor air quality issues, and what can be done to mitigate the problem.\n\nAttempt to remedy the situation. After you've done your homework, implement solutions to the IAQ problems and continue to monitor and seek feedback from building occupants.\n\nHow Was This Problem Created Anyway?\n\nFrequently, problems result when a building is operated or maintained in a manner that is inconsistent with its original design or prescribed operating procedures. Other times, indoor air problems can be just plain old bad design. And in some cases, the way the occupants of the building use the space may create the problem. For example, a neighbor in a condo building smokes like a chimney and it affects you directly, or a contractor lays down toxic adhesives within a commercial office remodel."}

E-mail address: james.mclaughlin@ucd.ie\n2 Italian Institute of Health, Viale Regina Elena 299, 000160 Rome.\nABSTRACT\nIn the European Union lung cancer death is the most common cause (circa 20%) of\ntotal cancer deaths. For 2006 it is estimated that 236,000 lung cancer deaths occurred\nin the EU 25 with the majority of these being due to active cigarette smoking. From\nthe pooling of 13 residential radon epidemiological studies in 9 EU countries it has\nbeen estimated that about 9% of lung cancer deaths may be due to radon exposure in\nthe home. In this paper an account is given of the lung cancer risk estimates derived\nfrom these and other residential radon epidemiological studies. A summary account is\nalso given of the mechanisms by which radon can cause lung cancer. Based on the\nepidemiological studies it is estimated that in 2006 in the EU 25 about 21,000 lung\ncancer deaths were due to radon exposure. The important role of smoking in radon\nrelated lung cancer is discussed. Also discussed are sources of indoor radon as well as\npractical strategies that may be adopted to reduce residential radon exposures and the\nassociated lung cancer risks.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the EU as in most developed regions of the world lung cancer is the most common\ncause of death from cancer. It is estimated that 19.7% of all cancer deaths in the EU in\n2006 were due to lung cancer (1). The vast majority of these lung cancer deaths are\nattributable to cigarette smoking but residential radon studies estimate that radon\nexposure may be responsible for a not insignificant percentage of these deaths. The\nU.S. Surgeon General has cited radon to be the second cause of lung cancer after\nactive smoking and radon has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by IARC (2, 3).\nIt has been tentatively suggested and is being investigated that radon exposure may be\nassociated with other health endpoints such as leukaemia in children or adults but at\npresent the only health effect established for radon is that it does cause lung cancer\n(4).\nIn indoor air radon produces a series of short-lived decay products which may attach\nto aerosol particles present in the air or deposit on room surfaces. It is the inhalation\nand deposition of the airborne short-lived radon decay products which gives rise to\nirradiation by alpha particles of sensitive cells in lung tissue such as the basal cells of\nthe bronchial epithelium (5). From considerations of their respective radioactive half\n199\nlives as well as their physical and chemical properties lung dosimetry models show\nthat the radiation dose delivered to the lung is dominated by the alpha particles\nemitted by the short-lived radon decay products Po-218 (E\u03b1 = 6.00 MeV) and Po-214\n(E\u03b1 = 7.68 MeV). Because these alpha particles have respective ranges of only 48 \u00b5m\nand 71 \u00b5m in tissue they deliver a high density of ionization damage to cells in these\nshort distances. It is this lung dose that is considered to be the cause of radon induced\nlung cancer either on its own or jointly with tobacco smoke carcinogens. This is\nsupported by animal studies. Due their respective size dependent spatial deposition\npatterns in the human respiratory tract radon decay products unattached to aerosols\n(the unattached fraction) deliver a greater alpha radiation dose to sensitive lung tissue\nin the bronchial region compared to those attached to aerosols (the attached fraction).\nMINER AND RESIDENTIAL STUDIES OF RADON HEALTH EFFECTS\nThere have been numerous studies over past decades into the effects of elevated radon\nexposure on underground miners both those in uranium mines and in other types of\nmines (5). Due to differences in study design and in particular to large errors in\nmeasuring radon and its decay products in these mines the lung cancer risk factor\nestimates from these studies cover a range of values. All of them, however, showed a\nclear dose-related increased risk due to radon exposure. Information on smoking\nstatus was available only for a fraction of miners of some of these studies. For smoker\nminers, the relative risk per unit radon exposure were found to be about 2\u20133 times\nhigher than the relative risk for all the miners (6,7). This means that the combined risk\nof smoking and radon was found in these studies to be sub-multiplicative but to be\nmore than additive, thus suggesting synergism between radon and tobacco smoke. In\nabsolute terms the estimated risks per unit radon exposure to smokers was found to be\ngreater than for non-smokers in the mining cohorts. Attempts have been made to\ntransfer or apply the miner studies' risk factors to members of the public exposed to\nradon in their homes or to the general workforce in above ground workplaces, but this\nhas proved to be somewhat problematic. This is primarily because the miner studies\nonly give estimated risks for adult male miners whose breathing rates, lung\nmorphometry, etc, differ from that of the general population. Moreover, miners were\nexposed to some more risk factors for lung cancer than are the general population in\ntheir homes. In addition aerosol characteristics, degree of equilibrium between radon\nand its decay products and other aspects of underground mines which influence radon\nprogeny behaviour and consequent deposition pattern in the respiratory tract differ\nconsiderably from those present in homes. Nevertheless, Lubin et al. and the U.S.\nNational Research Council BEIR VI Committee took data on residential radon\nexposure in the U.S. together with data on lung cancer mortality from 11 cohorts of\nunderground miners and on this basis evaluated that the best estimate of the\ncontribution from residential radon exposure to lung cancer deaths in the U.S. is about\n10% or 15%, depending on the model used to fit miner data, with a 95% confidence\ninterval of 3%-21% (7, 8). As stated above in this approach, there are many sources of\nuncertainty in extrapolating from the miner occupational studies to the public. An\nalternative approach to such use of miner studies or of the more theoretical approach\nof lung dosimetry modeling for estimating the radon lung cancer risk to the public has\n200\nbeen to directly determine the lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure\nstudies.\nSince the 1980s a number of case-control residential radon epidemiological studies\nhave taken place in North America, in Europe and in China. A review of these can be\nfound in (9). Some of the individual studies yielded results which were equivocal. A\nmeta-analysis, however, of the summary odds ratios for these studies showed a\nslightly significant association between the lung cancer risk and residential radon\nexposure which was consistent with the results from the occupationally exposed miner\nstudies (10). However, heterogeneity among these studies occurred, probably due to\ndifferent control of confounding factors which cannot be controlled uniformly in a\nmeta-analysis, whereas it can be done with a pooled analysis (11, 12).\nMore recently the results of a pooling of North American residential radon studies in a\ncombined analysis of 7 North American case-control studies has been published (11).\nIn this pooling study the radon measurements were based on long-term alpha track\nradon detectors placed in current and former homes of study subjects. Data was\ngathered on modifying factors, including age, sex, and smoking habits of the subjects.\nThe study involved 3,662 cases of lung cancer and 4,966 controls. Collaborative\nanalysis of individual data was carried out and data on each separate individual in the\nseven studies were collated centrally and analyzed with uniform methods.\nThe odds ratios for lung cancer was found to be increased with increasing radon\nexposure categories, with an odds ratio of 1.37 (95% CI = 0.98\u20131.92) for\nconcentrations exceeding 200 Bq\/m3 relative to concentrations under 25 Bq\/m3. Using\na continuous linear model to fit data, the overall estimate of the excess odds ratio for\nlung cancer per 100 Bq\/m3 was 11%, which was slightly significant (95% CI = 0%-\n28%). No substantial differences was observed in the excess odds ratio by categories\nof cigarette smoking, number smoked per day, duration of smoking, or time since\nquitting. The data obtained in this pooling provides direct evidence of an association\nbetween residential radon exposure and lung cancer in keeping with extrapolation\nfrom the miner studies.\nIn Europe a similar pooling of residential radon studies has also taken place in recent\nyears and, like their North American counterpart, has clearly demonstrated and\nestimated the lung cancer risks associated with radon exposure in homes. Moreover,\ndue to the larger total study size and the higher radon exposure levels of the European\nstudies, a higher statistical power and therefore smaller confidence intervals were\nobtained and further analyses were possible to be carried out. This collaborative\nanalysis involved 13 European epidemiological studies from nine EU Member States\n(Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the\nUnited Kingdom) and included individual data on 7,148 lung cancer cases and 14,208\ncontrols without lung cancer (12,13). Each of these European case-control studies of\nresidential radon and lung cancer had over 150 people with lung cancer and 150\ncontrols without lung cancer. These studies incorporated detailed smoking histories of\nall subjects and sought radon measurements in homes inhabited by these individuals\nduring the past 15 years or more. As in the North American pooling study data on\neach separate individual in the thirteen European studies was analyzed with uniform\nmethods and was collated centrally. Radon measurements were obtained from\nresidences occupied during the 5-34 year period prior to lung cancer diagnosis or\nacceptance as a control.\n201\nIn this collaborative study a proportionate increase in risk was found not to be\nstrongly influenced by any one study. The dose-response relationship appeared linear\nwith no evidence of a threshold, and a significant relation remained even among those\nwhose average measured radon concentrations were below 200 Bq\/m3. A non-\nregulatory Reference Level of 200 Bq\/m3 for residential radon has been in common\nuse in some European countries for many years, originally recommended by the\nEuropean Communities for future dwellings (14). The absolute risk to smokers and\nrecent ex-smokers was not unexpectedly found to be much greater than that to lifelong\nnon-smokers. This study has provided strong direct evidence of a statistically\nsignificant association of residential radon exposure and lung cancer, as predicted by\nextrapolation from the miner studies. The risk of lung cancer after stratification for\nstudy, age, sex, region of residence, and smoking increased by 8.4% (95% CI = 3.0%\u2013\n15.8%) per 100 Bq\/m3 increase in measured radon concentration. No evidence was\nfound that the excess relative risk varied with age, sex or smoking history. When\ncorrections were applied to remove the bias arising from random uncertainties in\nradon exposure assessment, the dose-response relation was found to remain linear but\nincreased twice in magnitude to 16% (95% CI = 5%\u201331%) per 100 Bq\/m3 increase of\nthe estimated mean corrected radon concentration. While the estimated excess relative\nrisks were independent of smoking status, in absolute terms the risks to smokers at\nany level of radon exposure were much greater than those to lifelong never smokers.\nFor example, taking the risk to lifelong non-smokers exposed to a radon concentration\nof 0 Bq\/m3 to be 1.0 the relative risk for a habitual smoker of 15-24 cigarettes per day\nrelative to this was estimated to be 25.8, 29.9 and 42.3 at radon concentrations of 0,\n100 and 400 Bq\/m3 respectively. For lifelong non-smokers the corresponding risks are\nestimated to be 1.0, 1.2 and 1.6 respectively. While the very high risks for smokers\nexposed to radon may seem to indicate that the risk from radon exposure is only\nimportant for smokers this is not the case. Taking the absolute lifetime risk to 75 years\nof lung cancer for lifelong non-smokers not exposed to radon to be about 0.41% (or 1\nin 250) then on the basis of the Darby et al study for continuous exposure to radon\nconcentrations of 400 Bq\/m3 and 800 Bq\/m3 this risk will be increased by factors of\nabout 1.6 and 2.3, respectively. In the latter case at 800 Bq\/m3 the estimated absolute\nrisk to a lifelong non-smoker will have increased to 0.93% (or close to 1 in 100). Even\nallowing for the many uncertainties in such an estimate an involuntary risk of this\nmagnitude of contracting a fatal cancer cannot reasonably be considered to be trivial.\nIn the context of radon and smoking it should be noted that an interaction between\npassive smoking and exposure to radon has also been estimated, although the combined\nrisk would be much lower than for active smoking and with a larger confidence interval.\nTherefore, in this paper we will consider synergism between radon and active smoking,\nonly. It should be noted that a pooling analysis of all the Chinese, North American and\nEuropean studies which is presently underway is expected to be more informative than\nthe previous regional ones.\nIn 2006 lung cancer was the most common cause of cancer death in Europe with an\nestimated 334,800 (19.7% of total) deaths (1). Its major cause is smoking but on the\nbasis of the Darby et al study it is estimated that in Europe, exposure to radon in the\nhome may account for about 9% (95% CI = 3%\u201317%) of deaths from lung cancer and\n2% of all deaths from cancer (12,13). This major collaborative study of 13 residential\nradon epidemiological studies in 9 EU Member States therefore forms a very solid\n202\nbasis for policy makers both at EU and Member State levels to formulate and develop\neffective radon risk management strategies.\nESTIMATING RADON RELATED LUNG CANCER DEATHS IN THE EU\nThe collaborative pooled analyses of epidemiological studies in North America and in\nEurope have provided strong evidence that residential radon is an important cause of\nlung cancer. The European collaborative analysis in particular has quantified the\nradon related risk of lung cancer to smokers and former smokers relative to that of\nlifelong never smokers. This study gives a firm basis in principle for estimating the\nburden of radon related lung cancer deaths in the EU. The process of making a\nrealistic estimate of this burden, however, requires the existence and availability of\nreliable data bases on indoor radon concentrations and also of smoking prevalence in\nall Member States.\nIt should be noted in Table 2 that mean indoor radon concentrations throughout the\nEU are quite variable. Large variability in indoor radon concentrations may also be\npresent within individual countries. There are many contributory factors to such\nvariability. As indoor radon in most houses originates in the soil or rock subjacent to\nthe house the geological and soil characteristics in a region are a strong determinant of\nindoor radon levels. Building design, air-tightness of houses and also ventilation\npreferences of the occupants can also be major influences on the indoor radon level.\nThese factors combined with the geographical distribution of the population in a\ncountry can also contribute to the variability. A good example is the UK where high\nindoor radon values are present in the Devon and Cornwall peninsula but the mean\npopulation weighted national indoor radon level at 21.7 Bq\/m3 is one of the lowest in\nthe EU. This is primarily due to the fact that a large fraction of the UK population\nlives in the London region which is mainly built on clay with low radon emanating\nand permeability characteristics.\nIn the case of smoking habits the data bases available also show there is considerable\nvariability in smoking prevalence throughout the EU. As shown in Table 1 the\npercentage of adults who smoke in the EU ranges from 17.5% in Sweden to 45% in\nGreece (15). The EU average is 29% but despite wide variations in smoking prevalence\namong member states, the overall average for the 25 member states is broadly the same\nas it was before enlargement in 2004. While the average percentage of non-smoking\nadults in the EU can be taken from Table 2 to be 71% it should be noted that the non-\nsmoking cohort is composed both of lifelong never smokers and former smokers. As the\nrisk of radon related lung cancer is strongly influenced by smoking status and as the\nlung cancer risk decreases with time since quitting smoking in order to make a realistic\nestimate of radon related lung cancer incidence in the EU good information on former\nor ex-smokers is needed in addition to data on present active smokers (16). Where\nnational data on former smokers is available it usually simply given as their percentage\nin the population with little or no additional information such as the time since they\nstopped active smoking or indeed the duration and extent of their previous active\nsmoking habits. In spite of these and other limitations in the available radon and\nsmoking data it is possible using the findings of the Darby et al collaborative study to\n203\nmake an estimation of the lung cancer impact due to radon in the EU. As already\nstated above in this study it was estimated that in Europe, exposure to radon in the\nhome accounts for about 9% of deaths from lung cancer and perhaps up to 2% of all\ndeaths from cancer. More accurate estimates on the radon lung cancer burden in\nEurope are presently being made but are not yet completed. As lung cancer deaths in\nEurope are estimated to have been 334,800 in 2006 this implies that perhaps up to\n30,000 of these deaths may have been caused by exposure to radon in the home (1).\nThe corresponding estimated figures in 2006 for the EU 25 are 236,000 and about\n21,000 respectively. In considering these putative radon related EU lung cancer deaths\nthe following three important qualifying observations must be made:\n(1) The majority of these estimated radon related lung related cancer deaths occur\nin active smokers exposed to radon.\n(2) It should also be noted that, due to the near log-normal distribution of indoor\nradon levels found in all national surveys the majority of these deaths will\noccur to persons (both smokers and non-smokers) exposed to indoor radon\nlevels well below the indoor radon Reference Level of 200 Bq\/m3 used in most\nEuropean and EU countries.\n(3) Residential radon studies have shown that the risk of lung cancer due to the\ncombined effects of smoking and radon exposure are much greater than the\nadditive effect of both individual risks. Therefore in estimating the global lung\ncancer burden in a country or region good data is needed on not only the\nindoor radon distribution but also on smoking prevalence. As Table 2 shows\nsmoking prevalence is quite variable throughout the EU. While the EU mean\nis 29% the percentage of active smokers ranges from 17.5% in Sweden to 45%\nin Greece.\nThese three observations have important implications for policy makers in the EU\nformulating policies and strategies aimed at managing the lung cancer risk from\nindoor radon.\n204\nTable 1.

As radon is a gas its concentration in a building can be quite variable both\ndiurnally and seasonally due to changes in meteorological parameters, ventilation\npractices etc. Due to this variability it is generally the case that an assessment of radon\nexposure in a building is best achieved by making a long-term passive measurement\nof radon. Typically this is done using alpha track\u2013etch detectors (17). In many EU\nMember States such long\u2013term indoor radon measurements are usually made over a\nperiod of at least three months and preferably in the heating season when radon levels\nare usually at their highest. In these cases, the annual average can be obtained by\napplying seasonal correction factors. In some other EU Member States one-year\nmeasurements are preferred to obtain the annual average radon concentration. A\ncommon approach is to place one detector in the main living room of a house and a\nsecond one in the principal bedroom.\nIn most of the older EU Member States extensive and representative surveys of indoor\nradon have taken place while in many of the recent accession countries representative\nnationwide indoor radon surveys have yet to take place. Table 1 gives a summary of\nthe indoor radon data in the EU 25 expressed in units of Bq\/m3. Because of\ndifferences in the characteristics of these surveys it is not possible to calculate a\npopulation weighted EU average indoor radon concentration but it is probably close to\n50 Bq\/m3. The distribution of indoor radon in most countries approximates well to a\nlog-normal distribution. While they are very rare a small number of homes with\nindoor radon levels of some tens of thousands of Bq\/m3 have been found in a number\nof countries.\n205\nTable 2.

It is produced in most rocks\nand soils from which it may enter the indoor air of houses. There are a number of\npossible sources of indoor radon. The most important source for most buildings is soil\ngas infiltration. It is well established that this is driven by the positive pressure\ngradient that usually exists between the subjacent soil gas and the indoor air spaces of\na building (20). In assessing the risk potential of soil for high indoor radon\nconcentrations in future buildings the main determinants are the subjacent soil\npermeability, its radium-226 activity concentration and the associated concentration\nof radon in the soil gas. In some EU member states such as the Czech Republic and\nSweden soil radon risk classification based on such soil characteristic is in use (21). In\nmost EU member states, while soil and geological characteristics are taken into\naccount, strategies to achieve low radon levels in future buildings in an area are\nlargely based on surveys on indoor radon levels in existing buildings and on the use of\nradon proof construction technologies.\nIn general the contribution to indoor radon levels due to radon emanation from\nbuilding materials is minor compared to the contribution from soil gas. There are\nexceptions to this, for example, in parts of Italy where high radium content volcanic\ntuff is used as a building material or in Sweden where alum shale containing elevated\nlevels of radium has been used in the past as aggregate in aerated concrete products\n(17).\n206\nRADON CONTROL OPTIONS\nWhile exposure to indoor radon gives rise to a lung cancer risk this risk in principle\ncan be controlled or reduced. At the level of an individual house it is technically\nfeasible, in most cases, to ensure that the indoor radon level is kept at or brought\ndown below a reference or action level set by the national radiation regulatory\nagencies. In principle the use of ventilation as a means to reduce indoor radon levels\nappears to be an obvious radon control strategy. It should be noted, however, in the\nmajority of buildings with a radon problem the source of the radon is soil gas which\nenters the building by pressure driven flow. Therefore if ventilation is used care must\nbe taken to ensure that the ventilation regime does not increase the pressure driven\nflow thus increasing indoor radon levels. A ventilation solution to an indoor radon\nproblem also may carry an energy penalty. The preferred approaches to controlling\nindoor radon levels are active soil depressurization by means of sub-floor radon\nsumps coupled to extraction fans and\/or the installation of radon impermeable barriers\nor membranes in the building foundations (22).\nAs already mentioned above the most common residential radon reference level being\nused in EU countries is 200 Bq\/m3. This reference level is a recommended value and\nis not a mandatory regulatory level unlike an Action Level such as 400 or 500 Bq\/m3\nfor radon in workplaces set by some Member States in their implementation of the EU\nBasic Safety Standards Directive (23). In the case of an existing house found to be\nabove such a reference level remedial action might involve the installation of a sub-\nfloor sump coupled to an extractor fan or some other appropriate remedial technology,\nsuch as a radon membrane barrier, to reduce soil gas radon entry to the house living\nspaces (22). The cost of such remedial action will vary considerably from one house\ntype to another but experience in some EU countries would indicate that remediation\ncosts should be between \u20ac 500 and \u20ac 2000. In the case of future houses the\nincorporation of radon control building technologies into the construction is less\ncostly than their retrofitting in existing houses and would represent a very small\nfraction of the cost of new house construction. The incorporation of such building\ntechnologies in all new houses is already part of the existing building codes in some\nEU member states such as Ireland (24). WHO Air Quality Guidelines for Europe also\nsuggest that building codes should include sections to ensure that radon daughter\nlevels do not exceed 100 Bq\/m3 EER (Equilibrium Equivalent Radon concentration)\nwhich is similar to a radon concentration of about 200\u2013250 Bq\/m3 (25).\nApart from these building technology aspects there are a number of different\nstrategies that can be adopted at a national level to control indoor radon with the\nobjective reducing the lung cancer risk associated with long term radon exposure.\nThese strategies may be divided into the following three principal categories:\n(A) Identification of houses with high radon levels and the remediation of these\nhouses. This is rather like the concept often used in radiation protection where a\ncritical group of the most exposed persons is considered a protection priority and the\nmain objective is to reduce individual high risks.\nIn most countries a house with an indoor radon level above 1000 Bq\/m3 would be\nclassified as \"high\" as the estimated lifetime lung cancer risk, even for a lifelong\nnever smoker, would be considered unacceptable by most standards of health\nprotection. On the basis of European national radon surveys which show that the\n207\ndistribution approximates closely to a log-normal distribution the percentage of\ndwellings in most EU states likely to have a radon level above 1000 Bq\/m3 will be\nvery low. For example in Ireland, where the mean indoor level is 91 Bq\/m3 it is\nestimated that in < 0.1% of houses is the radon level above 1000 Bq\/m3. Obviously\nwhere high houses are found at random in an area householders should be strongly\nadvised to take action and the competent regulatory agencies should carry out more\ndetailed local surveys to find other high houses that may be present in the area. The\nproblems and costs of finding all high houses on a national basis would not appear in\nmost countries to be justified both from a practical perspective and also from a cost-\nbenefit analysis perspective. On the other hand having a strategy to find high radon\nhouses may be justified in a defined region known to have a high radon potential due\nto its geological and soil characteristics.\n(B) As a consequence of the characteristics of log-normal distributions and the fact\nthat national average indoor radon levels in the EU are mostly below 100 Bq\/m3 the\nbest strategy in principle to reduce the collective risks, i.e. the radon related number of\nlung cancers in the population, should be to reduce the average indoor radon level in a\ncountry. For the existing housing stock this is not a practical or cost effective option.\nThe reduction of radon levels in new build future houses by the introduction of\nappropriate radon preventative building regulations is perhaps therefore the only\neffective strategy that can over time effectively reduce the national risk from radon\nrelated lung cancer. In regions known to have a high radon potential particularly\nstringent radon prevention building regulations might be considered.\n(C) Due to the demonstrated synergism between radon and smoking in terms of\ncausing lung cancer a strategy that should be considered is to couple radon reduction\nstrategies with national strategies aimed at reducing the consumption of cigarettes.\nIn most EU Member States where there are well developed radon control policies a\nmixture of the above strategy options (A) and (B) are usually in operation together\nwith radon risk communication programmes. However, having a combined strategy of\nreducing smoking and radon exposure is presently not part of the public health\nprogramme in any EU Member State.\nCONCLUSION\nIt has been demonstrated by residential radon studies that exposure to radon increases\nthe risk of lung cancer. Even though the estimated excess relative risk factor of 16%\nper 100 Bq\/m3 was found not to vary with age, sex or smoking history the absolute\nlung cancer risk associated with unit radon exposure is much greater for active\nsmokers than for lifelong never smokers. In the EU it is estimated that radon related\nlung cancer deaths account for about 9% (95% CI = 3%\u201317%) of the total and similar\nestimates can be obtained from North American studies. Radon levels in homes are\ncontrollable by various building technology options such as the installation of active\nradon sumps and radon proof membranes in the foundations of houses. Coupled to the\nintroduction of indoor radon control regulations there is a need at EU level to\nestablish strict protocols and training programmes to ensure the effective use of these\ntechniques. While radon levels in high radon homes should be reduced it is more cost-\neffective at a national level to adopt building regulation strategies aimed at reducing\n208\nthe average radon levels in new houses below the current national average level. In\nthe case of radon risk communication programmes, however, information on the\nexacerbation of the lung cancer risk in smokers by radon exposure should be\nemphasised.\nREFERENCES\n(1) Ferlay.J, Autier.P, Boniol.M et al. \"Estimates of the cancer incidence and mortality in\nEurope in 2006\".

{"text":"Headlines\n\nThe Department of the Interior (DOI), National Park Service, supports the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal to revise the primary and secondary ozone standards as described below.\n\nEPA proposes revising current ozone standards to ensure that the primary and secondary standards are clearly grounded in science, increasing the protection of public health and protecting the environment.\n\nThe EPA proposes revising the primary standard from 0.075 to\nwithin the range of 0.060\u20130.070 parts per million (ppm). These values will do more to protect children and other \"at risk\" populations from adverse health effects. Like the current standard, the proposed standard is based on an 8-hour average of ozone concentration.\n\nEPA also proposes revising the secondary\nstandard for ground-level ozone to provide greater protection\nto natural vegetation. The current secondary standard is\nidentical to the primary human health standard of 0.075 ppm. EPA proposes changing the metric for the secondary standard\nto W126, a measure that preferentially weights the higher ozone\nconcentrations most likely to affect plants and sums all\nweighted concentrations during daylight hours over three\nmonths during the growing season. This is a cumulative metric\nexpressed in ppm-hours. EPA proposes setting a value for the\nsecondary standard within the range of 7\u201315 ppm-hours.\n\nThe Department of the Interior, National Park Service, supports EPA's proposed modifications and agrees that these changes to the ozone standard will do more to protect human health and the environment. Specific comments concerning proposed changes to the primary and secondary standards are in the official comment letter from DOI to EPA below.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is conducting a combined review of the secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2). This is the first time since the NAAQS were established that EPA has assessed the impacts of multiple pollutants jointly. By jointly reviewing the impacts to environmental resources from NOx and SO2, EPA is setting precedence for multi-pollutant planning strategies.\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains NP,\nNorth Carolina & Tennessee\n\nNOx and SO2 are closely related pollutants with emissions from similar sources, common atmospheric transport, chemical transformation, and deposition processes, and related environmental impacts. NOx and SO2 contribute to deposition of nitrate (NO3) and sulfate (SO4) ions (also called acid deposition) that is adversely affecting sensitive aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nThe Clean Air Act requires the secondary standard for NOx and SO2 to specify an acceptable level in the ambient air that is protective of known or anticipated adverse effects to public welfare. The current secondary standards for NOx and SO2 do not meet that requirement because there are documented adverse impacts at current NOx and SO2 concentrations.\n\nEPA has completed a Risk and Exposure Assessment (REA) for NOx and SO2. As illustrated in the flow chart below, EPA takes a unique approach to link ambient air concentrations of NOx and SO2 to deposition of NO3 and SO4, and to indicators of ecological impacts. Acid deposition has been demonstrated to cause:\n\nacidification of sensitive lakes and streams and damage to sensitive aquatic species, including native trout in the eastern United States,\n\nacidification of sensitive forests in the eastern US, including sugar maple and red spruce in the Northeast and spruce and fir ecosystems in Southern Appalachia,\n\nchanges to diatom populations in alpine lakes in the western US and contributing to eutrophication (reduced dissolved oxygen) of estuaries in the eastern US excess (from excess nitrogen deposition), and\n\nalterations to species composition and susceptibility to fire in sensitive forest ecosystems in California (from excess nitrogen deposition).\n\nEPA intends to recommend levels of ecological indicators for the above impacts that would provide protection for specific resources and to link the ecological indicators back to a level of deposition that would not exceed that recommended levels of the ecological indicator. EPA is considering using flux, or transfer from the ambient air concentration to deposition to sensitive ecosystems, as the basis for the secondary standard. NPS and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee endorse this novel approach to establishing secondary standards that are responsive to ecosystem risks.\n\nRocky Mountain NP, Colorado\n\nNPS ARD contributed to the technical analyses and development of EPA\ufffds assessment and reviewed the draft assessments. EPA highlighted case studies from Shenandoah and Rocky Mountain National Parks in the assessment.\n\nEPA is under court order to recommend revised secondary standards by February 2010. Because there is insufficient time to develop policy recommendations, it is likely that EPA will not propose a fundamentally new form of the secondary standards this fall but will expedite revisions for the next NAAQS review for NOx and SO2.

{"text":"Stories tagged with \"Clean Air Act\"\n\nThis year's report showcases the levels of ozone and particle pollution from official monitoring sites in the United States from 2009-2011. Though it has the most current and complete data, it does not represent a full picture of every county in America because less than one-third even have air monitors. The report recommends that all counties get monitors for this reason. Still, this state-by-state map of each state's air report card is a helpful tool to find out how clean the air is in a particular region.\n\nMany places in the U.S. \"made strong progress over 2008-2010, particularly in lower year-round levels of particle pollution.\" This was largely due to reductions in coal power plant emissions and cleaner diesel fuels, and occurred as the economy started to improve.\n\nThe ALA report identified carbon pollution as a major source of dirty air:\n\nPower plants are the largest stationary source of greenhouse gases in the United States. Energy production accounts for 86 percent of total 2009 greenhouse gas emissions, and the electric sector represents 39 percent of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In 2012, the EPA proposed the first ever limits on carbon pollution from new power plants. Now the EPA needs to finish the job and issue strong final standards for carbon pollution from new and existing plants.According to a new study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, there is a small \u2014 but steady \u2014 link between local air pollution levels and lower infant birth weight.\n\nWhile there is some speculation as to the exact nature of the link between air pollution and low infant birth weight, experts theorize that air pollution \"can affect the attachment of the fetus to the placenta\" and \"stress the mother's body, which could affect fetal growth.\" And, as the study found, the more the air pollution, the lower birth weights tended to be:\n\nThe researchers found that for every 10-microgram increase of pollution particles per cubic meter of air, average birth weights decreased by 8.9 grams, roughly one-third of an ounce, and infants were 3 percent more likely to be a low birth weight. An infant is considered low birth weight if he or she weighs less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces.\n\nLow birth weight is a known risk factor for infant mortality as well as heart, breathing and behavior problems later in life.\n\nPollution levels at study sites ranged from approximately 10 to 70 micrograms per cubic meter of air. \"These are definitely exposures that people would have in many places around the world,\" said Tracey Woodruff, a reproductive health scientist in the division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, who worked on the study. \"This study increases our confidence that the impact of air pollution on birth weight is real.\"\n\nAir pollution has increasingly come under scrutiny as a major contributor to poor public health, particularly after shocking images of Beijing's catastrophic air contamination levels became worldwide news. For the first time ever, air pollution is now considered a bigger killer than high cholesterol.\n\nBut the problem isn't limited to China or other developing nations just now mastering the use of mechanical industry. In Utah \u2014 one of the five most polluted states in America \u2014 doctors have urged Gov. Gary Herbert (R) to declare a public health emergency over what they perceive to be dangerous levels of air pollution, regardless of the significant environmental advances made under the auspices of the Clean Air Act.\n\nDozens of doctors, as part of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, want lawmakers to take immediate action to address the state's deadly air pollution problem. The group delivered a letter, signed by more than 60 doctors, requesting the governor declare a public health emergency over Utah's poor air quality:\n\n\"[W]e know from thousands of medical studies that people are dying in our community right now because of the air pollution and its role in triggering strokes, heart attacks, congestive heart failure, fatal arrhythmias, lung diseases and infections and infant mortality.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the doctors are advising people to avoid the outdoors \u2014 though that may be difficult with tourists attending the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nAir pollution has become a deadlier public health issue than high cholesterol. And winter pollution in Utah is a long-standing problem, particularly soot. Right now, Utah ranks among four of the five unhealthiest cities for air quality \u2014 although even the poor status quo represents steady progress, thanks to Clean Air Act protections. The Salt Lake Tribune writes, \"Older Utahns can tell stories about the soot that their windshield wipers would push away during inversions of that era.\"I've spent the last nine months giving birth to a new organization\u2014really an act of incredible team gestation\u2014called Moms Clean Air Force. Labor took place on my kitchen table\u2014and before I start hyperventilating, I'll leave off the birth metaphors. Let me just say this work has been some of the most exhilarating I've ever done.\n\nI've been meeting moms from across the country. Moms\u2014Republicans, Democrats, Independents and Apoliticals, at least until now\u2014who are fed up with the status quo. Sick of dollars first, babies second. Moms in Alabama who don't want to make a choice between jobs and their children's health. Moms in Ohio who are alarmed by research linking behavioral issues to air pollution. Moms in Arizona making emergency room runs with asthmatic children. Moms in Pennsylvania outraged that the shale rush is fouling their skies. Moms in Michigan who want their teenagers to have job opportunities in clean energy\u2014without having to leave their home state. Moms in New Hampshire who just want to eat tuna fish again. Moms in Dallas who are worried about that brown bubble of smog over their homes.\n\nWe are moms who don't believe the science deniers. We deny that the situation is hopeless. We can do something about climate change. We respect science\u2014and doctors\u2014and we listen when they warn us of danger. We know exactly who is going to be around to suffer the impacts of extreme weather that will make today's headlines about floods, droughts and heat waves look quaint. Our little ones. The loves of our lives. We know that the crazy stuff we are seeing today is just the beginning of global warming. And it is already bad enough.\n\nPhoto: Sean Suddes\/Sierra Club\n\nIs all this terrifying? Overwhelming? You bet. Moms today feel like they have to be EPA, FDA, and USDA rolled into one. But we know it is impossible to \"shop\" our way out of pollution problems. There isn't an air filter on the market that can protect us. Money can buy the right to pollute. But money cannot buy clean air.\n\nBeing a good mom means being an engaged citizen. The only way to get strong regulations is to demand them. Moms hear \"pollution regulations\" and we think, Good: Protection. That's why, Republicans and Democrats, we have rallied around Administrator Lisa Jackson\u2014the mom of a severely asthmatic son. She has done a historic job of enhancing the Clean Air Act. Her work will have a long legacy. We're grateful for her vision and courage.\n\nDo politicians really want to make their mothers angry? Most of us aren't marching in the streets or getting arrested\u2014yet. But we're signing petitions, writing letters, meeting with our political representatives, and letting them know: Listen to your mothers. We share the air. Stop polluting it.\n\nMother Love is the original renewable. The supply is endless. We hope Washington gets a charge out of itAs U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administration Lisa Jackson announces the first-ever Clean Air Act rules to limit mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants, Republicans are already attacking this historic advance for public health. The health risks of this potent neurotoxin are enormously well-documented. Methylmercury from coal pollution accumulates in fish, poisoning pregnant women and small children. Mercury can harm children's developing brains, including effects on memory, attention, language, and fine motor and visual spatial skills. But Republicans are willing to argue that the profits of the coal industry outweigh the well-being of America's children.\n\n\"There are already strict regulations relating to mercury emissions,\" Rep. Ed Whitfield (R-KY), the chair of the House energy and power subcommittee, falsely claimed in an interview today with Fox News. \"Obviously whatever controls the EPA has in place are not working if our fish are tainted,\" Fox's Alisyn Camerota shot back. Whitfield then made the false claim that \"there is not going to be any benefit from this new regulation in reducing mercury levels\":\n\nCAMWatch it:\n\nWhitfield and energy committee chair Fred Upton (R-MI) have assiduously avoided having medical experts testify about the EPA's mercury rules, instead parading utility and coal industry officials before their committee to make exaggerated claims about the costs of upgrading power plants to protect children's health. At one such hearing, Rep. Joe Barton denied the \"medical negative\" of mercury exposure.\n\nThe glimmer of fact in Whitfield's claims is that the health costs of mercury poisoning of our nation's children over decades of unlimited coal pollution are difficult to quantify. Mercury poisoning is rarely fatal and hard to detect, but causes undeniable, insidious developmental harm to fetuses and babies.\n\nCost-benefit analyses conducted by epidemiologists for the new rule emphasize the equally real live-saving impact of cutting the deadly soot pollution from the few dozen ancient coal plants that emit most of the nation's mercury pollution. By conceding that cutting the particulate matter would save thousands of lives, Whitfield was in effect admitting that current ambient air quality standards are not sufficient to protect American health either.\n\nUpdate\n\nA presidential memorandum issued by President Obama this afternoon notes: \"Analyses conducted by the EPA and the Department of Energy (DOE) indicate that the MATS Rule is not anticipated to compromise electric generating resource adequacy in any region of the country.\"\n\nLong-delayed rules to limit toxins like mercury and arsenic from coal-burning power plants will be approved today, after twenty years of delay that protected coal utility profits at the expense of American health. The Los Angeles Times reports that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will finalize its mercury rule today, marking the end of an era of deliberate pollution despite the scientific knowledge that pregnant women and small children were being poisoned:\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is expected to approve a tough new rule on Friday to limit emissions of mercury, arsenic and other toxins from the country's power plants, according to people with knowledge of the new standard. Though mercury is a known neurotoxin profoundly harmful to children and pregnant women, the air toxins rule has been more than 20 years in the making, repeatedly stymied because of objections from coal-burning utilities about the cost of installing pollution control equipment.\n\nIn 1990 the bipartisan legislation that amended the Clean Air Act ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to set standards for the emission of mercury, arsenic, and other toxic air pollution from power plants. Although a court decree mandated EPA standards by 2000, the rules were repeatedly delayed again. In 2006, the Bush administration released rules that were thrown out by the courts for failing to protect the public health. The health risks of mercury and arsenic are enormously well-documented. In the 21 years since the EPA was ordered to issue these rules, 17 states have independently acted to limit mercury emissions from power plants. Coal-fired power plants alone produce 772 million pounds of airborne toxins every year\u20142.5 pounds' worth for every American.\n\nOf course, the primary economic benefit of the mercury rule comes from its life-saving impact. Methylmercury from coal pollution accumulates in fish, poisoning pregnant women and small children. Mercury can harm children's developing brains, including effects on memory, attention, language, and fine motor and visual spatial skills. Upgrades to the aged and dirty coal plants will also significantly reduce harmful particle pollution, preventing hundreds of thousands of illnesses and up to 17,000 premature deaths each year. \"The 'monetized' value of these and certain other health benefits would amount to $55\u2013146 billion per year,\" the Economic Policy Institute states."}

{"text":"When UC Davis scientists collected air pollution particles in Fresno and then exposed laboratory mice to them, they found that one of the most toxic sources was the backyard grill.\n\nAlong with particles from vehicle and wood-burning emissions, particulates from residential cooking had the greatest measurable impacts on mice lung function.\n\n\"That was like, wow!,\" said Anthony Wexler, the study's coauthor and director of the Air Quality Research Center at UC Davis. \"It's not that you're cooking; it's how you're cooking.

{"text":"Carbon Monoxide Alarms\n\nby Ralph Winn\n\nCarbon monoxide is called \u010fthe silent killer\u0112 for a reason. Virtually undetectable, the colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas sends thousands to the hospital each year. Sadly, hundreds of people die annually from carbon monoxide poisoning, and many of these deaths could have been prevented.\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning most often occurs in the home as a result of improper ventilation or a leak in a major heating appliance. A blocked chimney or malfunctioning heating equipment can release carbon monoxide gas into your home instead of venting it outside. And because it\u00eds so difficult to detect, it can make you and your family sick before you even realize that it\u00eds there.\n\nA carbon monoxide alarm can give you extra peace of mind. These alarms are designed to detect the poisonous gas in the air and alert you with enough time to get out and into the fresh air immediately. Carbon monoxide alarms should be installed in a common area near all bedrooms (if bedrooms are far from each other, you should install more than one) to make sure they wake up everyone sleeping in the house.\n\nThere are many types of carbon monoxide alarms available today. It\u00eds a good idea to compare prices and features, but you may want to choose an alarm with battery backup. A backup offers additional protection in case you lose power \u0116 just remember to check the batteries and test the alarm regularly.\n\nPrevention is key\n\nIn addition to installing a carbon monoxide alarm in your home, you should also take preventive, common sense steps to reduce your risk of carbon monoxide exposure. Use this checklist to help you make your home safer:\n\n- Have heating equipment inspected by a professional once a year, including your fireplace, water heater, gas dryer, and other heating or cooking appliances.\n- Don\u00edt use gas appliances like your stove or oven to heat your home.\n- Never, ever burn charcoal in your home or any other enclosed space.\n- Don\u00edt idle your car in the garage, even if the garage door is open. Vehicles also produce carbon monoxide.\n- Never run a gas-powered generator in your home.\n\nRemember that carbon monoxide can overpower you in seconds. Keeping your heating and cooking appliances in good repair and installing a carbon monoxide alarm can lower your risk of exposure."}
{"text":"LEC Research to Feature on BBC National News\n\nProfessor Barbara Maher of the Lancaster Environment Centre has been interviewed for BBC national news following her novel research using magnetic measurements of roadside tree leaves as a proxy for vehicle-derived particle pollution.\n\nThe BBC's environment and science correspondent David Shukman spent two days on location in Lancaster for a feature to be broadcast on the BBC Six O'Clock or Ten O'Clock TV news bulletins later this month.\n\nProf Maher took him to a pollution hotspot at Cable Street in Lancaster before the film crew moved onto Cathedral RC Primary School, where she explained to children from the school's Environment Club how to monitor levels of fine particles on roadside trees near the playground.\n\nThe children were later invited back to the University's internationally known Centre for Environmental Magnetism & Palaeomagnetism at LEC for more information on the research.\n\nDavid Shukman said: \"It's been very interesting to see what's going on at the University and hear how it ties in with people's daily life. Pollution is a big topic at the moment.\"\n\nFine-grained pollution particles pose some health risk at any level of exposure, particularly with regard to heart attack and stroke, lung cancer, low birth weights, and mental development in children.\n\nProfessor Maher along with Ruth Mitchell (Lancaster University) and colleagues Catherine Moore from the University of East Anglia and Dr Juergen Matzka from the Danish Meteorological Institute analysed roadside tree leaves from a variety of roadside locations.\n\nThey found that concentrations of PM10 were highest at the height of a small child - 0.3m - and also at adult head height, between 1.5 and 2m. This means that monitoring station collectors placed at 3m above the surface significantly under-estimate kerbside, near-surface PM10 concentrations. These results indicate that vulnerable groups, especially young children, are exposed to fine, metal-rich, vehicle-derived particules.\n\nHigh levels of trace metals are implicated in lung disease and central nervous system disorders ranging from learning disorders to dementia and possibly even Alzheimer's disease.\n\nProfessor Barbara Maher said her research had shown that magnetic measurements of roadside tree leaves could provide the key data for assessing accurately the levels of pollution that people are exposed to in different areas, and thus identifying much more precisely the specific health risks which result"}
{"text":"I. General comments on air pollution and health\n\nIt is hard to avoid air pollution. We are exposed to different levels of air pollution wherever we go. We are exposed to it when we travel to and from work or school, and when we play or exercise outdoors. We are exposed to certain kinds of air pollution in our homes and offices, and during the normal course of our daily activities. How much air pollution we are exposed to depends on how many chemicals or particles are in the air, how fast we breathe, and how much time we spend indoors or outdoors. This website is designed to help you learn more about air pollution, and to provide you with information that will help you reduce your exposure to harmful pollution levels.\n\nThe sources of air pollution vary from area to area and from day to day. Cars, trucks, buses, and other \"mobile sources\" are often major contributors to air pollution in California, but industrial plants and consumer products, such as paints or cleaning products that are used in many homes, can also cause air pollution. Fires and dusty operations can also contribute to air pollution.\n\nIt is unlikely that we will be able to completely avoid polluting the air, but we are making good progress in reducing unwanted and harmful air pollutants. Learning about air pollution and how to reduce your exposure is a good first step in protecting your health. Local air districts, the California Air Resources Board, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are good sources of information on air quality and its health effects. The information provided below was drawn from all three of these governmental agencies. Additional references are given for those who want to learn more.\n\nII. Ozone\n\nWhat is ozone? Ozone is a gas that occurs in the Earth's upper atmosphere (protective ozone) and at ground level (harmful ozone). Ground level ozone results from the interaction of nitrogen oxides with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. The primary sources of these gasses are cars and trucks, and in California we get lots of sunlight from spring through fall which is our typical \"ozone season.\"\n\nOzone is a very reactive chemical. It is an oxidant that can react on contact with the cells lining the surface of the lungs to form other reactive chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide. Ozone and its reactive products are strong irritants to the lungs and can trigger an asthma episode and worsen bronchitis.\n\nWho is most at risk from ozone exposure? Health risks from ozone are primarily a function of the duration and level of exposure, whether we are exercising or working outdoors, and our health status. Children and adults who are active outdoors have greater exposures because they breathe faster, thereby inhaling more ozone and breathing it deeper into their lungs. People with respiratory diseases such as asthma, emphysema, and bronchitis may experience increased symptoms and difficulty breathing when ozone levels are high. Some healthy people are more sensitive to ozone, and experience health effects at lower levels of ozone during moderate levels of outdoor activity than the average person.\n\nWhat are common symptoms of ozone exposure? Many people experience one or more of the following: irritation of the nose and throat, increased mucus production and tendency to cough, eye irritation, and rapid shallow breathing. When ozone reaches very high levels, most people experience discomfort when breathing and difficulty taking a deep breath without coughing. People with asthma may experience asthma attacks. Sometimes symptoms of asthma may not occur until hours after exposure to ozone. For some people who live in areas where ozone levels are frequently high, there may be no symptoms or they may be too subtle to notice.\n\nShort-Term effects of ozone. Exposures to high levels of ozone air pollution (e.g., air quality index significantly greater than 100) during exercise can result in respiratory symptoms of irritation, decrease in lung function, and airway inflammation in some people. High ozone levels may increase emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and possibly mortality. How susceptible any person is to the effects of ozone depends on their age, genetic differences, activity levels and duration, and pre-existing health conditions (e.g., asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema). Some individuals adapt to high ozone levels and are less responsive than people in low ozone environments. Some people may experience few symptoms and little change in lung function during exposure, but develop inflammation in their airways hours after exposure.\n\nThe body's response to high ozone levels may not always be felt right away, making it important for people who are at risk to be aware of the air quality index (AQI) for ozone so they can reduce their exposure when necessary and\/or medically manage their asthma.\n\nLong-Term effects of ozone. Unlike short-term exposures, chronic or long-term exposure to ozone may cause irreversible changes in lung function that may become a concern for respiratory health later in life. In one scientific study, Yale College students who had lived for four years or more in areas with high summer ozone levels (AQIs above 100) showed decreased lung function. Similar effects were seen in first year students at the University of California at Berkeley. Scientists are also looking into a possible causal relationship between asthma and ozone exposures. In the Children's Health Study conducted in southern California, children who competed in three or more sports over several years were compared to children who played no sports in communities with seasonally high ozone. The more active children were more likely to experience symptoms of asthma and develop new cases of asthma.\n\nHow to reduce exposures to ozone. People can learn when to reduce their exposure to ozone by paying attention to air quality reports and forecasts that notify the public when ozone levels are at unhealthy levels. In the U.S., state and local government agencies use EPA's AQI to report air quality to the public. You can sign-up for air quality notices for the Imperial Valley by clicking on the tab \"Air Quality Notifications.\"\n\nYou can reduce exposures to ozone by 20 to 80 percent by remaining indoors. While outdoors, you can reduce ozone exposures by reducing the intensity of your activities. Work or play that makes you breathe significantly harder also increases the amount of ozone inhaled deeper into your lungs.\n\nIII. Particulate matter\n\nWhat is particulate matter? Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles suspended in air that vary in size and composition. Sources of PM include dust from the earth's surface, biologic material such as pollen and spores, combustion sources such as forest fires, heating furnaces, power plants, factories and internal combustion engines (cars, trucks, buses, ships, trains, and construction equipment). The size, composition, and concentration of PM depend on its sources.\n\nParticle size determines how likely different particles are to deposit in different parts of the respiratory tract. The smaller the particles, the deeper they can travel into the lungs. The composition and concentration of chemicals found in PM contribute to its toxicity. Particles can contain: metals like iron, nickel, and copper; ions such as sulfate and nitrate; organic compounds; biological materials such as viruses and bacteria, and reactive gases such as ozone and peroxides.\n\nThe particles of concern for health effects are those that are readily inhaled into the lungs, typically 10 micrometers (\u00b5m) or less in diameter. For comparison, a human hair is about 60 \u00b5m in diameter and a human red blood cell is about 7 \u00b5m in diameter. Airborne particles ranging in size between 10 and 1 \u00b5m are generated from dust from unpaved roads and wind-blown dust. Smaller particles (around 2.5 \u00b5m and less) are generated from diesel and gasoline engines, tire and brake wear, and some agricultural practices. Particles less than 1 \u00b5m are combustion related or are formed by condensation of much smaller particles (less than 0.1 \u00b5m) and constitute smoke and haze.\n\nU.S. EPA regulates PM in two size categories, 10 \u00b5m or less (PM10) and 2.5 \u00b5m or less (PM2.5, \"fine\"). U.S. EPA is currently in the process of revising the national standards for these two categories of PM. Fine and ultrafine (less than 0.1 \u00b5m) particles are of most concern because they can be inhaled very deep into the lungs. These small particles can be more toxic because they have much larger surface areas on a weight-for-weight basis than larger particles (e.g., compare a pound of rocks with a pound of sand). Large surface areas allow easy transfer of soluble chemicals into cells lining the lungs. Very small particles may even penetrate into the bloodstream.\n\nHow do particles affect my lungs? Coughing is your body's first line of defense, as it naturally tries to clear the airways of any deposited particles. Particles that remain in the airways can induce an inflammatory response. This inflammation can cause damage to the cells lining the lungs and other cells in the airways. Such damage may reduce the body's defense mechanisms and increase susceptibility to infections if exposed to viruses and bacteria. The inflammatory response can cause certain constituents of the blood to clot. Particles can also affect the nervous system, changing our pattern of breathing, heart rate, and heart rate variability. These changes are more likely to affect persons who already have heart or lung disease.\n\nHealth effects from short-term exposures to PM. Healthy children and adults may experience temporary symptoms that include: coughing, phlegm, chest tightness; shortness of breath, and irritation of the eyes, nose and throat. Short\u2011term exposures over a few hours or a day can exacerbate lung disease, causing asthma attacks and acute bronchitis. Particulate air pollution can also increase susceptibility to respiratory infections such as colds, the flu, or bronchitis. In people with heart disease, such as coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure (heart can't pump enough blood to the body's other organs), short-term exposures have been linked to ischemia (reduced blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart), heart attacks, and cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms). Episodes of high levels of particulate air pollution have also been associated with increased hospital and emergency room visits. Epidemiological studies have shown an increase in mortality from heart and lung disease within a few days following high levels of PM.\n\nHealth effects from long-term exposures to PM. The effects of exposure to high PM levels over many years can be similar to short-term exposure. School-aged children may experience decreased lung function from long-term exposures to PM in combination with other air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and acid vapors). These changes in lung function are not reversible and add to the normal decline in lung function that occurs later in life.\n\nWho is most at risk from PM exposures? Older adults (60+ yrs) with heart and lung disease are likely to experience more severe effects from short-term exposures to PM compared to healthy adults. Epidemiological studies have shown an increase in mortality from heart or lung disease within a few days following high levels of PM. Premature mortality appears to be associated with both PM10 and PM2.5.\n\nPeople with asthma may experience more intense or more frequent symptoms or attacks. People with diabetes may be at greater risk to the health effects of particulate air pollution. Infants and very young children may be more at risk to long-term PM exposures because their lungs are still in a rapid stage of development, and because children breathe more air per lung volume and body weight than adults. Healthy school-aged children are at lower risk to short-term PM exposures. Although scientists have just started researching these effects, there is some evidence for neonatal or infant mortality, low birth weight, and higher rates of premature deliveries associated with PM exposure.\n\nHow to reduce exposures to PM. Exposures to PM can occur both indoors and outdoors. To reduce your exposure to outdoor air pollution, try to limit your activities to times when air quality is better. Try to play and exercise at least 500 feet away from busy freeways and roads. When you drive in your car, especially in stop-and-go traffic, it is important to try to keep your windows closed and the air conditioner running (if you have one). Outdoor particles can seep in through doors, windows, and even ventilation systems. Properly equipped and functioning air ventilation and filtration systems can reduce indoor levels of PM. Not smoking indoors will markedly reduce indoor PM.\n\nIV. Carbon Monoxide\n\nWhat is carbon monoxide? Carbon monoxide is an odorless and colorless gas formed from the incomplete combustion of organic (carbon-containing) matter. The largest source of carbon monoxide is from vehicular exhaust, up to 95% in cities. Other sources include wildfires, some industrial processes, and kerosene and gas-fired appliances that are not properly vented. The highest exposure to carbon monoxide comes from smoking cigarettes.\n\nHow does carbon monoxide affect my health? Exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide can cause headaches, nausea, or heart pain. Those most susceptible include infants, small children, the elderly and heart and respiratory patients. Carbon monoxide competes with oxygen to bind to the hemoglobin proteins in your blood. Because it binds more tightly to hemoglobin than oxygen, it tends to build up in the blood even when exposure levels are low. Carbon monoxide can also remain elevated hours after exposures have decreased.\n\nThe feeling of carbon monoxide poisoning is similar to the feeling of being at high altitude where there is less oxygen in the air. The brain and the heart must have an adequate supply of oxygen to function; decreased oxygen to the brain and central nervous system results in slowed reaction times, light-headedness, and headaches. Exposure to very high levels of carbon monoxide can cause oxygen starvation of the brain, leading to coma and even death. Such a condition is not likely in outdoor air, but could occur indoors when appliances are not properly vented or if a lawn mower or vehicle is operated inside a closed garage.\n\nWho is most at risk from carbon monoxide exposures? People with certain types of heart disease are most at risk. For example, people with angina may experience chest pain and other cardiovascular symptoms while exercising. People with ischemic heart disease (reduced blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart) are susceptible to carbon monoxide. The narrowing of their coronary arteries (often from plaque) physically restricts blood flow to their heart tissue that cannot compensate for low oxygenated blood due to carbon monoxide exposures. Low oxygen conditions disturb normal heart rhythms and can lead to a heart attack. Pregnant women should avoid exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide because of potential harm to their babies.\n\nHow to reduce exposures to carbon monoxide. Because carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless there is no warning that you are being exposed. Carbon monoxide levels are highest during the winter because cars don't operate as efficiently in colder temperatures. Winter weather conditions often produce inversions that trap colder air beneath a layer of warmer air that results in less mixing of air pollutants and higher ground levels of carbon monoxide. Vigorous outdoor activities on such days should be reduced if carbon monoxide levels are in the \"unhealthy\" category. Carbon monoxide poisoning can be prevented by proper use, maintenance, and venting of any appliances that produce a flame. Care should also be taken not to operate car engines or other gas-powered equipment in enclosed or attached garages.\n\nV. Combined health effects of air pollutants \u2013 smog\n\nEpidemiology studies of the health effects of air pollution look at large populations exposed to the pollution in the air where they live. In these studies, it can be difficult to determine which of the observed health effects are due to a single air pollutant or a combination of pollutants. Individual air pollutants are best evaluated in controlled breathing chamber studies; however, these are limited to a smaller number of people. Toxicology studies examine the effects of single chemicals and mixtures of pollutants on laboratory animals and specific cell types. By comparing the results from epidemiology, breathing chamber, and toxicology studies we can determine how air pollution affects the body, and how we can better protect our health.\n\nInformation from epidemiology and toxicology studies indicates that both ozone and PM can affect the respiratory system, and that people with asthma are sensitive to both pollutants. The combination of PM and carbon monoxide can affect people with heart disease. Chronic exposure, over multiple years, to PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, acidic vapors, and elemental carbon may be associated with changes in lung development in children 10 to 18 years old. Whether each of these four pollutants contributed to changes in lung function is uncertain since these pollutants are typically found together in urban air.\n\nOzone and PM together can intensify the inflammatory response in people with asthma. Exposure to ozone and PM together may also cause a reduction in heart rate variability, the natural ability of the heart to change rhythm in response to exercise and stress.\n\nThis website was developed by the California Air Resources Board in\ncooperation with the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District and\nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency."}

{"text":"Prof. Gao urges decrease of carbon emissions in transportation sector\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 9, Prof. Oliver Gao, civil and environmental engineering, who focuses on the nexus of transportation, air quality and energy, discussed his ongoing research on the effect of different fuels on air quality measurements.\n\nTransportation-related air pollution is a significant issue across the globe. In 2005, the Clean Air Task Force reported that fine particle pollution from diesels (fuel used in internal combustion engines) shortens 21,000 Americans' lives each year, including 3,000 early deaths from lung cancer. 400,000 people suffer each year from asthma attacks.\n\nThis is illustrated in the South Bronx, New York's asthma hot spot and one of the poorest sections in the city. The region's highways, waste transfer stations, and meat, fish and flower markets, which serve Manhattan, are some of the busiest in the world. Before 7 a.m. each day, smoke-spewing trucks have already released noxious fumes into the air. These diesel particles cause asthma rates to rise four to five times higher than the national average.\n\nDiesel particles, along with gas particles, make up diesel exhaust, which promotes a 7.5 times greater risk of cancer than the combined total cancer risk from all other air toxins in the nation, according to the Clean Air Task Force. Particles are classified according to size and composition, and the most dangerous particles are \"ultrafine.\" In comparison, a human hair is 60 micrometers, and an ultrafine postulate is 0.1 micrometer.\n\nUltrafine particles can bypass human respiratory system mechanisms and penetrate into the lungs. In addition to airways and blood vessels, new research suggests that ultrafine particles can also harm the brain.\n\nLilian Calder\u00f3n-Garcidue\u00f1as at the National Institute of Pediatrics in Mexico City tracked children in the city for four years, and observed that they suffered from cognitive impairments in memory, problem solving and judgment, as well as deficiencies in their sense of smell compared with age-matched children from a city with better air quality.\n\nAt the Harvard School of Public Health, Shakira Franco Suglia's group conducted research that suggests children's minds may be especially susceptible to inflammation caused by ultrafine particles. This inflammation causes nerve cell damage, which resembles characteristics of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases.\n\nAlthough the EPA acknowledges the dangers of ultrafine particles, it regulates emissions according to particle mass, not particle number (P.N.). Gao's research indicates that large, coarse-mode particles (a micrometer or more in diameter) dominate in terms of particle mass, whereas ultrafine particles dominate in terms of number.\n\nGao and his group collected particle measurements while going through New York City as a typical traveler. They found that particle mass was highest in underground stations (possibly due to dust), while P.N. was highest on urban streets. Ultrafine particles emitted by traffic are highest along streets but drops off significantly around 100 yards away.\n\nGao studied the connection between P.N. measurements and vehicle operations. His findings have challenged notions that new energy technologies are better for humans.\n\n$100,000 hybrids, for example, do not reduce PN concentration. In contrast, diesel particle filters, which only cost $10,000 to $15,000, can reduce P.N. concentration by 99 percent. Gao's group tested filtered vegetable oil biofuel supplied by Ithaca Biodiesel, and found that biofuels not only reduced greenhouse gas emissions but also particle number concentrations. B20 (20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel) can reduce P.N. concentration by 36 percent.\n\nThe debate of particle mass versus P.N. and biofuel versus hybrid diesel-electric is the more pertinent in light of the $50 billion transportation infrastructure plan, \"Renewing and Expanding America's Roads, Railways, and Runways,\" announced by President Obama on Sept. 6."}

{"text":"Washington, June 28 (ANI): Soot particles contained in the exhaust from diesel-fuelled vehicles, wood fires and coal-driven power stations is not only a scourge for the climate but also for human health.\n\nEvery time we breathe, we inhale these tiny particles in the atmosphere.\n\nNow researchers have for the first time shown that more than half of all inhaled soot particles gets stuck in the lungs.\n\nThe figure is higher than for most other types of particles. For example \"only\" 20 per cent of another type of particle from wood smoke and other biomass combustion gets stuck in the lungs.\n\nOne explanation is that diesel soot is made up of smaller particles and can therefore penetrate deeper into the lungs, where it is deposited.\n\nThe study was made on diesel particles (which mainly consist of soot). Ten healthy people volunteered for the study.\n\n\"Findings of this kind can be extremely useful both for researchers to determine what doses of soot we get into our lungs out of the amount we are exposed to, and to enable public authorities to establish well-founded limits for soot particles in outdoor air,\" said Jenny Rissler, researcher in aerosol technology at Lund University's Faculty of Engineering and responsible for publishing the study.\n\nIn population studies, other researchers have been able to observe that people who live in areas with high concentrations of particulates are more affected by both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. But since there is no conclusive evidence that it is precisely the soot that is to blame, the authorities have so far not taken any decisions on guidelines.\n\n\"Currently there is no specific limit for soot particles in the air, despite the fact that soot in the air is linked to both lung cancer and other diseases,\" noted Rissler.\n\nBut she thinks that in the future, limits on soot levels will also be set, with reference to the WHO's recent reclassification of diesel exhaust from \"probably carcinogenic\" to \"carcinogenic\".\n\nSoot particles are not only connected to effects on health but may also contribute to a warmer climate. Paradoxically, other types of aerosol particles can partly be desirable, insofar as they have a cooling effect on the climate and thereby mitigate the warming effect of carbon dioxide.\n\n\"Soot particles are black and absorbs light, thus producing a warming effect. So it could be a double advantage to reduce it,\" she stated.\n\nRissler will next be studying individual variations in lung deposition and exposing cells to soot. She is also in the process of further developing methods to measure the surface area of the particles, as this has shown to be an important indicator of their harmfulness.\n\nThe study was recently published in the Journal of Aerosol"}
{"text":"Air Quality\n\nGlobal warming and air pollution are related problems linked by the combustion of fossil fuels. The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas produces not only greenhouse gases, but also a range of harmful air pollutants, including ozone, airborne particulates, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Exposure to these pollutants causes a number of adverse health effects ranging from shortness of breath and coughing to lung cancer and premature death. As emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise, so too will emissions of these harmful air pollutants. Increasing temperatures will further worsen air quality problems across the United States. Hotter temperatures will speed the formation of ground-level ozone, the main component of smog. Smog exposure damages the lungs and can lead to the development and aggravation of chronic lung diseases, such as asthma. Higher temperatures, combined with elevated carbon dioxide levels, may also increase the concentration of natural air pollutants, such as pollen, which will exacerbate the symptoms of people with allergies. Additionally, as people struggle to adapt to warmer temperatures, increased energy use to power air conditioners on hot days would put even greater amounts of pollutants into the air"}
{"text":"New Ads Put Face on Cost of Carbon Pollution In PA\n\nMarch 12, 2012\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. - New television ads you may be seeing in Pennsylvania aim to shed light on the health effects of industrial carbon pollution, especially on children.\n\nTwo environmental groups are rolling out a large-scale advertising campaign to bring problems connected to industrial carbon pollution to light.

For this reason we have developed an index for assessing current air quality conditions at parks throughout the country that assigns them to one of three categories:\n\nThe NPS Air Resources Division oversees the air resource management program. It is important to measure the program's effectiveness based on outcomes even though the NPS has no authority to regulate sources of air pollution located outside park boundaries.\n\nThe NPS can make a difference by: (1) acquiring high quality data, (2) making that information available to the general public, and (3) identifying and seizing opportunities to participate in decisions being made by regulatory agencies that might affect air quality in parks. Several indicators are used to measure progress. One indicator looks at visibility trends on the clearest and haziest days. Another tracks changes in ozone concentrations based on the 3-year average of the annual fourth highest daily maximum 8-hour concentration. The final indicator focuses on wet deposition of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium ions. An area meets the NPS air quality goals (related to visibility, ozone, and atmospheric deposition) if it does not show statistically significant deterioration in any of the indicators used to measure those goals during the most recent 10-year period for which data is available."}
{"text":"Letter: Silicosis isn't the new 'secondhand smoke'I understand Meyer's concern is exposure to silica dust with potential complications of silicosis that can lead to lung cancers. However, the sand being brought in is processed, ready for insertion into the oil or gas well head. It gets washed to remove clays and fines, then dried to remove all moisture and finally screened to grade the sand into specific grain sizes for various fracking applications.\n\nFrom the plant site, the sand is shipped in fully enclosed pneumatic trailers, consequently any dust is contained and not released to the atmosphere. Therefore, the public's exposure to dust is limited to that kicked up by the tractor-trailer's tires along the road.\n\nAnd, as to those 75 truckloads per day, they've been rolling through Red Wing for two and a half years now.\n\nBe it beach sand, or fracking sand, or sand box sand; they all contain silica. But it isn't the individual grains that are a health risk; it is the respirable dust, which is a very fine, minus 10 microns in size. While true this inhaled dust can lead to the development of cancers, like mesothemeoma, silicosis is classified as an occupational illness. The reason being, of course, the exposures are much greater when one is working in these industries, typically mining and sand blasting.\n\nSilicosis is not a new disease. It has been studied for over 100 years to better understand not just the health effects on industry employees but on the public as well. And, although I am no expert on this subject, I have done significant reading on it and I am unaware of any indication silica dust from mining and processing operations, or from truck traffic, poses a health risk to the general public.\n\nFracking sand is no more of a health hazard than sand box sand, the 75 trucks per day don't represent increased traffic through town (it is already there), and silicosis is not the new \"second-hand smoke.\"\n\nAnd one last thing, quartz is not in the asbestos family. Asbestos belongs to the vermiculite group which is hydrated silicates, has entirely different crystalline structure and with a mineral hardness of 2.5. Quartz is made up of SiO2, has a rhombohedral crystalline structure and a mineral hardness of 7.0."}

{"text":"Energy-efficient buildings can be hazardous to health\n\nHSPH FEATURES\n\nBuildings that are being weatherized and made energy-efficient and air tight can be hazardous to one's health, according to a new Institute of Medicine (IOM) report. The report, \"Climate Change, the Indoor Environment, and Health,\" prepared by a committee chaired by Harvard School of Public Health's (HSPH) John Spengler, recommends that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ensure that building weatherization and energy-efficiency efforts not generate new indoor health issues or worsen existing air quality. Among concerns cited are energy-efficiency updates (retrofits) of older buildings, use of untested or risky upgrades, and other alterations that could generate mold-causing dampness, poor ventilation, excessive temperatures, and emissions from building materials that may contribute to health problems.\n\n\"America is in the midst of a large experiment in which weatherization efforts, retrofits and other initiatives that affect air exchange between the indoor and outdoor environments are taking place, and new building materials and consumer products are being introduced indoors with relatively little consideration as to how they might affect the health of occupants,\" Spengler, Akira Yamaguchi Professor of Environmental Health and Human Habitation at HSPH, said in an IOM press release. \"Experience suggests that some of the effects could be negative. An upfront investment to consider the consequences of these actions before they play out and to avoid problems where they can be anticipated will yield benefits in health and in averted costs of medical care, remediation, and lost productivity.\"\n\nThe report was written at the request of the EPA, which asked the IOM to summarize current scientific understanding of the effects of climate change on indoor air and public health, and to offer priorities for action."}
{"text":"A carbon monoxide detector\/alarm can provide added protection, however they are not substitutes for proper use and upkeep of appliances that can produce CO.\n\nInstall CO detectors according to the manufacturers instructions.\n\nIf you suspect carbon monoxide, call 911.\n\nIf you smell gas, call 402.554.7777 any time 24\/7. No charge to check gas leaks.\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends that every home have at least one carbon monoxide detector for each floor of the home.\n\nThe Underwriters' Laboratories recommends placing carbon monoxide detectors within hearing range of each sleeping area. Place them near, but not directly above, combustion appliances such as furnaces and water heaters, near fire places or in the garage.\n\nDo not place detectors:\n\nWithin five feet of kitchen stoves and ovens, or\n\nNear areas where household chemicals and bleach are stored.\n\nDetectors may be placed near the floor or near the ceiling since carbon monoxide has nearly the same density as air.\n\nSmoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors protect against different hazards, therefore one is a not substitute for the other.\n\nTypes of detectors\n\nBoth 110-volt AC (plug-in and hardwired) and battery powered detectors are available. The detectors sound an 85-decibel alarm in the presence of certain concentrations of carbon monoxide over a preset period.\n\nAC versus Battery\n\nThe two options have both advantages and disadvantages. For example, a battery operated detector can detect carbon monoxide during power outages. However, a battery operated detector will not perform if the batteries are removed or are rundown.\n\nA carbon monoxide detector that uses AC with a battery back up would offer an advantage over a detector that is solely AC or battery-powered.\n\nPassive Sensors\n\nLess expensive, passive (meaning no power required) colorimetric sensors are intended to change color when exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide.\n\nConsumer Reports exposed three colorimetric sensors to 100 ppm of carbon monoxide for two hours and only one changed color.\n\nNone of the passive sensors sound alarms and, thus, none can alert someone who may be asleep or in another area of the home. Since carbon monoxide makes a person sleepy, an alarm is important.\n\nConsumer Reports rated the three passive sensors as unacceptable for home use.\n\nConsumer Products Safety Commission Document #466\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas. It is produced by the incomplete burning of solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels.\n\nEvery year, more than 200 people in the United States die from CO produced by fuel-burning appliances (furnaces, ranges, water heaters, room heaters).\n\nOthers die from CO produced while burning charcoal inside a home, garage, vehicle or tent. Still others die from CO produced by cars left running in attached garages. Several thousand people go to hospital emergency rooms for treatment for CO poisoning.\n\nSymptoms of CO poisoning\n\nThe initial symptoms of CO poisoning are similar to the flu (but without the fever). They include:\n\nHeadache Fatigue Shortness of breath Nausea\n\nDizziness\n\nMany people with CO poisoning mistake their symptoms for the flu or are misdiagnosed by physicians, which sometimes results in tragic deaths.\n\nWhat should you do to prevent CO?\n\nMake sure appliances are installed according to manufacturer's instructions and local building codes. Most appliances should be installed by professionals.\n\nHave the heating system (including chimneys and vents) inspected and serviced annually. The inspector should also check chimneys and flues for blockages, corrosion, partial and complete disconnections, and loose connections.\n\nInstall a CO detector\/alarm that meets the requirements of the current UL standard 2034 or the requirements of the IAS 6-96 standard.\n\nA carbon monoxide detector\/alarm can provide added protection, but is no substitute for proper use and upkeep of appliances that can produce CO.\n\nInstall a CO detector\/alarm in the hallway near every separate sleeping area of the home.\n\nMake sure the detector cannot be covered up by furniture or draperies.\n\nNever burn charcoal inside a home, garage, vehicle, or tent.\n\nNever use portable fuel-burning camping equipment inside a home, garage, vehicle, or tent.\n\nNever leave a car running in an attached garage, even with the garage door open.\n\nNever service fuel-burning appliances without proper knowledge, skills, and tools.\n\nHow should a consumer test a CO detector\/alarm to make sure it is working?\n\nConsumers should follow the manufacturer's instructions. Using a test button, some detectors\/alarms test whether the circuitry as well as the sensor which senses CO is working, while the test button on other detectors only tests whether the circuitry is working.\n\nFor those units which test the circuitry only, some manufacturers sell separate test kits to help the consumer test the CO sensor inside the alarm.\n\nWhat is the role of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in preventing CO?\n\nCPSC worked closely with Underwriters Laboratories (UL) to help develop the safety standard (UL 2034) for CO detectors\/alarms. CPSC helps promote carbon monoxide safety awareness to raise awareness of CO hazards and the need for regular maintenance of fuel-burning appliances.\n\nCPSC recommends that every home have a CO detector\/alarm that meets the requirements of the most recent UL standard 2034 or the IAS 6-96 standard in the hallway near every separate sleeping area.\n\nCPSC also works with industry to develop voluntary and mandatory standards for fuel-burning appliances.\n\nDo some cities require that CO detectors\/alarms be installed?\n\nOn September 15, 1993, Chicago, IL became one of the first cities in the nation to adopt an ordinance requiring, effective October 1, 1994, the installation of CO detectors\/alarms in all new single-family homes and in existing single-family residences that have new oil or gas furnaces.\n\nSeveral other cities also require CO detectors\/alarms in apartment buildings and single-family dwellings.\n\nShould CO detectors\/alarms be used in motor homes and other recreational vehicles?\n\nCO detectors\/alarms are available for boats and recreational vehicles and should be used. The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association requires CO detectors\/alarms in motor homes and in towable recreational vehicles that have a generator or are prepped for a generator.\n\nCarbon monoxide, chemical compound of carbon and oxygen with the formula, CO, is a colorless, odorless gas, about 3 percent lighter than air. It is poisonous to all warm-blooded animals and to many other forms of life. When inhaled CO combines with hemoglobin in the blood, preventing absorption of oxygen and resulting in asphyxiation.\n\nCarbon monoxide is formed whenever carbon or substances containing carbon are burned with an insufficient air supply. Even when the amount of air is theoretically sufficient, the reaction is not always complete, so that the combustion gases contain some free oxygen and some carbon monoxide.\n\nAn incomplete reaction is especially probable when it takes place quickly, as in an automobile engine. For this reason, automobile-exhaust gases contain harmful quantities of carbon monoxide, sometimes several percent, although antipollution devices are intended to keep the level below 1 percent.\n\nAs little as 1\/1000 of 1 percent of carbon monoxide in air may produce symptoms of poisoning, and as little as 1\/5 of 1 percent may prove fatal in less than 30 minutes.\n\nCarbon monoxide is a major ingredient of the air pollution in urban areas. Because it is odorless, carbon monoxide is an insidious poison.\n\nIt produces only mild symptoms of headache, nausea, or fatigue, followed by unconsciousness. An automobile engine running in a closed garage can make the air noxious within a few minutes; a leaking furnace flue may fill a house with unsuspected poison.\n\nFuel gas, which may contain as much as 50 percent carbon monoxide, often has small quantities of unpleasant-smelling sulfur compounds purposely added to make leaks noticeable.\n\nCarbon monoxide is an important industrial fuel because it contains more than two-thirds of the heating value of the carbon from which it was formed.\n\nIt is a constituent of water gas, producer gas, blast furnace gas, and coal gas.In smelting, iron ore carbon monoxide formed from coke used in the process acts as a reducing agent, that is, it removes oxygen from the ore.\n\nCarbon monoxide combines actively with chlorine to form carbonyl chloride, or phosgene, and it combines with hydrogen, when heated in the presence of a catalyst, to form methyl alcohol.\n\nThe direct combination of carbon monoxide with certain metals, forming gaseous compounds, is used in refining those metals, particularly nickel."}

{"text":"Radon Levels a Concern in Denver, Colorado\n\nRadon, an odorless and invisible gas, silently creeps inside the homes of thousands across the country every day. Second only to smoking as the leading cause of lung cancer, the risk from this deadly killer is not as well known as that from smoking, yet it is equally prevalent in Denver, Colorado.\n\nWhile around 20 percent of Colorado adult residents are smokers, the remaining 80 percent may feel they are at little to no risk of lung cancer and similar diseases. Most understand the dangers of second hand smoke and take measures to limit their exposure. What they may not realize, however, is that Denver's radon levels often rank higher than the recommended safe exposure. The average national indoor radon levels are about 1.3 pCi\/L, yet 43 percent of the studied homes in the Denver region have produced results over 4.0 pCi\/L.\n\nExposure to Radon Levels in the Denver Region\n\nFor non-smokers, 4.0 pCi\/L puts them at as high of a risk from dying from the radon exposure as they are of dying in a car accident. A smoker's risk is an even higher \u2014 about five times the risk of dying in a car accident. Considering that the government has mandated seat belt laws across the country, radon exposure is just as real of a threat and should not be ignored. Many, however, do just that since they cannot see the problem or its effects. While the carnage from radon exposure is not as obvious as that produced by a car crash, its consequences can be just as deadly.\n\nDetecting High Radon Levels\n\nRadon gas cannot be detected through the senses of sight, sound, taste, touch or smell. However, with proper training and equipment, high radon levels can be detected and prevented. You can do this via either a short term or a long term test. Short term tests are easier and take anywhere from a couple of days to three months to complete, depending on the method used. A long term test takes more than three months, but it can give more detailed results, providing a better idea of the radon levels throughout the year. Either method, however, will alert you if you are at risk.\n\nCorrecting High Radon Levels\n\nIf high radon levels are detected, you should have SWAT Environmental's specialists begin immediate efforts to reduce them. Since cracks in the foundation allow radon to enter the living environment, sealing them is often the first step to help counter a radon contamination. There are also specialized ventilation systems that can be installed to force the radon out of the home. If you are constructing a new home in the Denver region, you should have the construction site checked first to see if radon is prevalent. If so, include a radon mitigation system in the home design.\n\nRadon is a very real threat in Denver, Colorado. Rather than ignore the problem, you should take the time to properly protect yourself from its risk to your health."}

They also measured the amount of sunlight the sites received at different times of the year. From their observations, the researchers found that it is the darkness (where they absorb light) or brightness (where they reflect light) of aerosols, not weather factors, that cause pollution to work against cloud formation or act as cloud maker.\n\n\"When the overall mixture of aerosols absorbs more sunlight, it is more effective at preventing clouds from forming. When aerosols are lighter in colour and absorb less energy, they have the opposite effect and actually help clouds to form,\" says Lorraine Remer of nasa. The study was published online in Science, on July 13, 2006. Previous studies based on data from nasa satellites had established both types of effects that aerosols have on cloud formation. It was observed that over the northern Atlantic Ocean, clouds that produce heavy rainstorms grew taller and were more frequent when plumes of pollution from North America or dust from Sahara desert were present. However, the researchers could not conclude if aerosols themselves were causing the clouds to change. \"Other local weather factors such as shifting winds and the amount of moisture in the air could have been responsible,\" said Ilan Koren, atmospheric scientist at the Weizmann Institute and one of the authors.\n\nExperts believe that the changing cloud cover in response to air pollution will have a major impact on climate. \"Since clouds control the rainfall and regulate much of earth's warming, any change in the pattern of cloud formation affects the climate,\" said Koren. Based on the insight into how aerosol pollution influences cloud cover, researchers estimate that the impact worldwide could be as much as a 5 per cent net increase in cloud cover. In polluted areas, these cloud changes can change the availability of fresh water and regional temperatures."}

Circul-Aire's APS-400 (Air Purification System) is designed to effectively remove particulate and gaseous contaminants from confined spaces, while reducing the amount of outside air that would normally be required for dilution of contaminants.\nWhen considering an alternative to outdoor air dilution within a given space, the Circul-Aire APS-400 is used to reduce contaminant concentrations within a space while minimizing the requirement for costly outdoor air that is often contaminated from the onset. The APS-400 can be used to eliminate internally generated contaminants, through its multistage filtration system and recirculate the required maximum amount of room air. The result is clean, healthy, breathable air that has been filtered of contaminants, both internally generated and existing in the outside air."}

Woodruff, professor of obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive sciences at University of California\n- San Francisco (UCSF), and Jennifer Parker, of the National Center for Health Statistics at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC), is published this week in an advance online issue of Environmental Health Perspectives.\n\nLow birth weight babies are at higher risk for health problems and death. Although most survive, they also have a higher chance of developing\nchronic health problems like diabetes and heart disease later in life.\n\nThe study is the largest of its kind, and examines data on more than three million births, collected from 14 sites in 9 countries in North America,\nSouth America, Europe, Asia and Australia.\n\nThe sites are research centers involved in the International Collaboration on Air Pollution and Pregnancy Outcomes, an international project set up\nin 2007. Most of the data used in the study was gathered during the mid-1990s to the late 2000s; the rest dates from before that period.\n\nThe reason for the study, note the researchers in their background information, is that while a growing body of evidence has linked maternal\nexposure to outdoor air pollution with adverse effects on fetal growth, it is inconsistent.\n\nTheir analysis shows that for all the sites worldwide, the higher the concentration of microscopic particles or particulates in the air, the more\nlow birth weight babies there were.\n\nAir pollution is measured according to the concentration, in micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g\/m3), of microscopic particles whose size is measured\nin microns (millionths of a meter).\n\nIn a statement, Woodruff says what is significant about the findings is that \"these are air pollution levels to which practically everyone in the world\nis commonly exposed.\"\n\n\"These microscopic particles, which are smaller than the width of a human hair, are in the air that we all breathe,\" she explains.\n\nShe points out that countries that tightly regulate air pollution have lower levels of these particles, and the US has seen considerable benefits to\nhealth and wellbeing in past decades from reducing levels of air pollution, benefits that far exceed the costs.\n\nFederal regulation in the US requires that the average concentration over a year should not exceed 12 \u00b5g\/m3 of particles smaller than 2.5\nmicrons.\n\nIn the European Union the limit is much higher at 25 \u00b5g\/m3, although it is under review.\n\nOne of the researchers, Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, of the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology (CREAL) in Barcelona, Spain,\nsays:\n\n\"This study comes at the right time to bring the issue to the attention of policy makers.\"\n\nNieuwenhuijsen explains that in Beijing, China, levels higher than 700 \u00b5g\/m3 have been observed recently.\n\n\"From the perspective of world health, levels like this are obviously completely unsustainable,\" he urges.\n\nFunds from the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institute for Environmental Sciences in the US, the Wellcome Fund in the UK, and\nthe Ministry of Science and Innovation in Spain, helped finance the study.\n\nSome of the children involved in this study will be followed into adulthood, as a result of which researchers hope to be able to see if mothers'\nexposure to air pollution affects health of their children in adulthood, regardless of birth weight.\n\nWritten by Catharine Paddock PhD\nCopyright: Medical News Today\nNot to be reproduced without permission of Medical News Today\n\nridiculous hypothesis\n\nposted by tangshuichun on 6 Feb 2013 at 1:51 pm\n\nwhere in the world this guy gets his source from? outrageous and stupid nonsense without hard proof. so all indoor fireplace and autos should be outlawed and all should start walking for our daily routine. what about china and india and other third world countries with higher population increase? they have smog and coal burn factories yet babies still born. i know what this numb-nut try to say. he doesn't want neighbor within thousand mile radius. what a jerk! go live on a desolate island!\n\nAdd Your Opinion On This Article\n\n'Air Pollution Tied To Low Birth"}

{"text":"Local Emissions\n\nAffecting the Air We Breath\n\nMotor vehicles emit a toxic stew of pollutants, which cause a host of environmental and health problems, ranging from acid rain to asthma. Below is a primer, providing the nuts and bolts on local emissions.\n\nWhat are local emissions?\n\nSulfur Dioxide - Sulfur Dioxide forms when fuels containing sulfur are burned. It can irritate the eyes and the respiratory tract. Prolonged inhalation can cause asthma and other respiratory diseases, including chronic bronchitis. It can cause premature death. Children, the elderly, and the infirm at the most at risk groups.\n\nNitrogen Oxide - Produced during combustion, Nitrogen Oxide, when combined with volatile organic compounds and sunlight, causes smog. It also reacts with other substances in the air to produce acid rain, which damages forests and lakes and corrodes buildings. It effects the human resperitory tract, resulting in asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming.\n\nParticulate Matter - Also known as PM, Particulate Matter is a complex combination of extremely small compounds, including dust, acids, and metals. The smaller the particles, the more dangerous they are. It can cause asthma, irregular heart beats, bronchitis, and premature death for people with lung diseases.\n*Source: US EPA.\n\nWhy Are They Called Local Emissions?\n\nUnlike Carbon Dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas that causes climate change, local emissions like the ones listed above primarily impact the immediate environment. People who live and work closest to areas that emit local pollutants - places like freeways, coal burning power plants, etc - are most likely to suffer health impacts.\n\nDr. Yifang Zhu, an Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University, has shown that in Los Angeles concentrations of carbon monoxide and ultra-fine particles dropped by 60-80% within 100 meters of the road (Zhu et al., 2002).\n\nNot So Local Anymore?\n\nMassive brown plumes of smog, resulting from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass, now stretch from the Arabian Peninsula to China, an indication that local pollution has become so concentrated and intense that it is starting to have global implications.\n\nWhile these clouds, which are visible by satellite and from airplanes, also hover over North America and Southern Africa, they are most prominent in Asia.\n\nThe clouds have such a strong environmental impact because they prevent light from passing through, affecting crop yields and forests that depend on photosynthesis.\n\nAt some points, clouds can be as much as a mile thick with yellow haze blotting out the sun."}

The concept of state-regulated air cleanup is becoming more and more popular in the United States. Smaller regions to police with specific laws that apply to the regions' issues can be easier to manage than on Federal levels.\n\nWhat are Air Pollution Control Districts?\n\nAs an example, the California State Environmental Protection Agency has a sub-division called the Air Resources Board. This board was created to help regulate the laws and conditions of the air in the state of California. In alignment with requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act, Air Pollution Districts create laws and regulations to improve air quality and keep the public informed of current air conditions in the state.\n\nWhy Air Pollution Control Districts were Created\n\nWith the creation of the Federal Clean Air Act of 1970, awareness of air quality became much more public. Many local governments found themselves under pressure by their constituents to make changes to existing regulations to improve the quality of air and life in their communities. No state felt the need for these adjustments more than California. With its large population and well-documented traffic issues, the effects of vehicles on the state's air quality were well-noted and often severe, even in the 1970's. Smog was already a buzzword back then, especially in the Los Angeles basin that was often shrouded in smog. But now the public realized there may be some things that their government could do to improve air quality in high profile and meaningful ways.\n\nThe Goals of Air Pollution Control Districts\n\nThe California Air Pollution Control Districts are subsidiaries of the California Air Resources Board. Their major goals are to provide safe and clean air for the state, protect the public from contaminants, enforce rules and regulations with these goals in mind, provide new approaches to reach these goals, and provide the best scientific information to the public. The overall mission is to protect the public and provide safe, breathable air for the environment.\n\nHow You Can Help Air Pollution Control Districts Reach their Goals\n\nCars are the highest producers of pollution, so cutting down on single-vehicle use as much as possible would greatly reduce the emissions that cause pollution. Using public transportation or biking to work is a great alternative source of mobility. Car-pooling to the office is a way to cut down on the costs of gas and decrease emissions. If you choose to drive, then researching alternative fuel choices or buying a hybrid car will also help the problem"}
{"text":"share this story\n\nOver the next few days, the Obama administration will decide whether to address a major public health challenge facing the country: the large amount of mercury that continually pours out of coal-fired power plants, contaminating our air and drinking water.\n\nEvery year, mercury from coal-fired power plants is responsible for thousands of premature deaths, heart attacks, and serious respiratory illnesses. In addition, mercury is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects.\n\nToday, because of mercury, a baby may be born with brain damage or cerebral palsy. An infant may begin developing asthma, which will mean missed school days, visits to the hospital, less physical exercise, and potentially a greater risk of diabetes. And a parent or grandparent may go to the hospital with a heart attack or severe bronchitis.\n\nWe can stop this. We can spare children this tragic injustice and the pain it brings their families. We can spare adults from losing years off their lives. And we can spare taxpayers the enormous health care costs that come with mercury-related-illnesses.\n\nCoal-fired power plants are responsible for 70 percent of our nation's mercury emissions. After being released into the air we breathe, mercury -- a heavy metal -- also falls into our soil and water, where it can contaminate the food we eat, especially fish.\n\nThe EPA has proposed rules that would reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants by 90%, preventing 12,200 emergency room visits and saving $80 billion a year in health care costs. The rules -- now sitting on the president's desk -- are two decades overdue.\n\nIn 1990, when the Clean Air Act was last revised, Congress directed the EPA to establish limits on mercury and other emissions of coal-fired power plants. In March, after 20 years of delay, the EPA has finally issued a set of draft rules. By Monday, the president will decide whether to adopt the draft rules, weaken them, or withdraw them entirely. It will be one of the defining tests of the administration's commitment to public health and environmental protection.\n\nThe big power companies have had years to improve mercury emissions controls, and a majority of coal-fired plants (54%) have already done so. The remaining coal-fired plants are generally old and inefficient, and should have been retired years ago. The owners of these plants have been promoting the idea that the EPA's rules will destroy the American economy and cause rolling blackouts. They won't. It's just a scare tactic. In fact, some of the leading voices in our nation's utility industry -- the businesses that run our power lines -- do not object to the EPA's proposed rules.\n\nThe utility industry knows that if plant owners decide it is not cost-effective to adopt mercury emission controls, those plants can be converted to cleaner-burning natural gas. That would create even more jobs and reduce costs for consumers, because natural gas plants are more efficient than coal plants. Many old plants have already undergone this transformation, and the American economy -- not to mention our public health -- is stronger for it.\n\nOwners of mercury-emitting coal-fired plants also argue they need more time, as well as long-term exemptions for some plants. There will always be excuses for delay. But two decades is long enough for the American people to wait for mercury to be removed from the air we breathe.\n\nCoal-fired power plants and the pollution they produce -- including mercury -- are the number one threat to our public health and the environment. That is why my foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, recently provided a $50 million grant to the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, with the goal of retiring one-third of the nation's coal fleet by 2020. But the federal government must not wait another decade -- or another week -- to begin phasing out a pollutant that has harmed so many people's health.\n\nThis is not an issue of jobs versus the environment. It's an issue of the American people's public health versus a narrow special interest. And it is now up to the President to declare the winner.\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nNew York City and its water supply are all down wind from the coal fired power plants.

One that is not just sponsored by special interests like the Kochs and put forward by their venal, corrupt facilitators - Boehner and McConnell.\n\nThat would require a set of national, or even state-level, committees to study the total costs of the various energy sources. Like, with oil, just how much do we spend in military spending, and lives and limbs, to ensure supply? With coal, just how much air, water and soil pollution is created? And, what is the cost of the health effects that are put upon the population? Etc.\n\nCurrently, governments at all levels have implemented tax policies that obscure the real costs - by hiding them in tax policy. Those tax policies then discourage rational behavioral change and investment because that behavior is based upon special interest lies. The result is monster trucks for recreational use based upon fuel that is artificially low priced, or lack of investment in insulation because of costs paid in other ways. Time to start charging for the full costs - and letting people make rational decisions.\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nWhat they need to learn how to do, is to re-combust the final output from the coal plants, in such a way that all byproducts are effectively destroyed, either through some kind of catalytic process, or my thought, which is superheating. Since coal plants usually are large steam engines that turn turbines that turn generators, there's a supply of both electricity, and water involved. Ok, so, connect an electrolyzer, and introduce a hydrogen-oxygen flame into the exhaust, and measure the net final output after that combustion process, an 'afterburner' if you will. You could even use that as another stage to gather more heat for the boiler. Where there's a will, there's a way. Where there's a politician, likely there's another tax on the way.\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nIf only it were as simple as the president making a decision within congress. Who owns the white house?

Autism and Alzheimer's are the same result of the mercury which invades our biology from burning coal or allowing the vaccinators to stab our children with mercury, aluminum, or lead.

To end all multinational and national corporations that are not there to make life easier for Americans or people in general, but to make themselves a handful of Corporate Kings to but governments in place to do their bidding and keep workers sick, slaves and accountable to them for anything that is necessary to be kept alive but indentured for the rest of their short lives living healthy.\n\nGlowbeanie: That is really the only solution! To end all multinational\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nBloomberg is 100% correct that switching from coal to gas generation will dramatically reduce mercury emissions. In fact, according to MIT, just using SURPLUS natural gas combined cycle generation before coal generation --meaning no new capital investment is required because the generation units exists and are on both the electric grid and gas pipeline system -- would reduce mercury emissions by 32%, NOX by 33% and CO2 emissions by 20%.\n\nThe problem with Bloomberg and most other politicians from New York and the Northeast is they want us to use gas but they don't want us to produce gas. There are enormous environmental benefits to consuming gas (we should switch out old coal industrial boilers for highly efficient gas boilers as well) and for the entire northeast, gas piped from the Marcellus compared to gas imports from the Middle East or gas piped from the US Gulf Coast region, would be much lower cost for the region's consumers. There are major benefits to gas but we keep talking about fracking for shale gas causing earthquakes, imploding the earth, reviving dormant volcanoes and other such nonsense. Figure out how to manage the environmental impacts from gas production, develop and enforce sensible regulation (please no regulations to prevent volcanic activity), then get the environmental and consumer benefits of gas. Get smart, not stupid.\n\nHave you looked at the reserves of our fossil fuels. Sadly we have 300 years of available coal. The gas reserves are a small fraction of that. Also, I, and I assume many others, would disagree that extraction issues are nonsense. Maybe you should visit a community that is near to current gas pumping stations. The health issues there are incredibly huge.\n\nNo, the number on coal reserves is 200 years and they calculate gas and coal reserves very differently. Natural gas they tend to look at producible or technically recoverable resources and with new shale resources we are approaching 100 years -- these are also very immature, and are bound to be much larger than current estimates suggest. Not so for coal which doesn't look at producible reserves -- 25 years worth for example, are under the city of Pittsburgh.\n\nI did not say all issues associated with gas production are nonsense, I said that volcanoes, the imploding earth and major earthquakes are nonsense. And I grew up with gas production, I understand the issues so don't act like you are the only community or set of communities that have ever had to deal with energy production. The environmental issues associated with shale production are certainly real and they are challenging but they are also manageable, much more so than climate change where natural gas has enormous benefits compared to coal (please don't come back to me with the bad work from Cornell suggesting gas is worse than coal, even the author is backing away). We also need gas to firm intermittent renewables.

He found that at night, the city's ozone level (rated in PPBs, or parts per billion) was near zero, but during the day it zoomed to more than 200 PPBs, far higher than the U.S. standard of 120.\n\nZhang's findings are reported in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.\n\nThe reason for the high daytime rating, Zhang says, can be directly traced to the huge refineries and petrochemical complexes in the area, plus the large amount of auto exhaust in Harris County. The highest ozone levels were found around the city's southeastern edge near the huge petrochemical plants.\n\n\"These plants emit large amounts of highly reactive volatile organic compounds and nitric oxides,\" Zhang says. \"At midday, the ozone readings are very high because of the industrial emissions, coupled with auto exhaust. It creates very big problems for Houston's air, and ozone levels are far above acceptable federal standards. At night, however, the ozone readings register almost zero, forming an urban scale ozone hole which is caused by nitrogen oxide emissions from the refineries and petrochemical plants and power plants. Nitrogen oxides eat up ozone at night.\n\n\"It all means a significant health risk is possible for people in this area unless something is done.\"\n\nSome studies have previously shown Houston to have some of the worst air pollution in the United States.

Our individual activities create air pollution, and all of us have the power to improve air quality through our actions. Try some of the following:\n\nKeep vehicles maintained. Keep your car, boat, and lawn equipment tuned up and follow your car's maintenance schedule. Engines that are well maintained are more fuel-efficient and cause less pollution.\n\nRefuel at dusk. Postpone refueling your car until after 6 p.m. on Air Quality Action Days. This reduces the emissions during the peak daylight hours when ozone formation is most likely.\n\nDon't top off your tank. When refueling your vehicle, stop at the click to avoid spilling gas and polluting the air and surface water.\n\nReduce use of gasoline-powered lawn equipment.The small engines in lawn care equipment are major polluters. Use hand-powered or electric lawn care equipment whenever possible, and consider landscaping to reduce the amount of grass on your property. On Air Quality Action Days, wait until after 6:00 p.m. to use gas-powered lawn equipment.\n\nConserve electricity. In the summer, set your air conditioning at the highest comfortable temperature (try 78 degrees). During winter, try a setting of 68 - 70 degrees to reduce electricity use by your heat pump. Reduce wintertime particulate matter pollution from oil furnaces by keeping them well maintained. Use ceiling fans to increase both cooling and heating efficiency.

{"text":"Indoor Air Quality\n\nJustin Corfield\n\nThough often taken for granted, indoor air quality is an important concern. Most people spend more time indoors than out, consequently the health risks posed by pollutants trapped within buildings can be significantly greater than those associated with outdoor air pollution. The main causes of poor indoor air quality fall into two broad categories: (1) emissions from building materials and furnishings, dirt and molds, chemical cleaning supplies, heating and air conditioning system fuels and filters, and site characteristics; and (2) poor ventilation that concentrates interior pollutants by preventing exchange with the outside air. Emissions from building materials and furnishings emerged as a problem with the increased use of processed wood products, foams and plastics. Virtually every modern building contains some of these products, for example, particleboard, plywood, fiberboard, and paneling. The primary pollutant associated with this group is formaldehyde, a component of many adhesives.

FILE|AFRICA REVIEW\n\nTanzanian industries have reduced the use of ozone depleting chemicals by 86 per cent by 2009, according to an East African Community official responsible for natural resources and environment.\n\nUntil 1999, the country used about 254 tonnes of such chemicals per year but they have since then been reduced to 35.76 tonnes annually three years ago, a 86 per cent drop, Mr Julius Achiula said.\n\nThe drop has also been attributed to the change of production technologies by many local industries as well as installation of ozone-friendly equipment at most of the high-rise buildings in Dar es Salaam.\n\nThe equipment includes air cooling systems and alternative chemicals whose application have minimum effect on ozone, a thin layer on the earth's atmosphere which protects the earth from the harmful radiation from the sun.\n\nMr Achiula, who was speaking during a training for air conditioning and refrigeration technicians, said Mansoor Daya,Ply Foam and Pan African Enterprises were among the factories which have changed to ozone-friendly production techniques.\n\nMolecules\n\n\"It is our hope that other factories will opt for the alternative technologies and chemicals which would not deplete ozone as per the regulations under the Montreal Protocol,\" he explained.\n\nOzone depletion has been blamed on large-scale release of some chemical compounds, notably chloroflourocarbons (CFCs) and bromoflourocarbons through man-made activities.\n\nThe chemicals are not easily degradable. Experts say the breakdown of ozone in the atmosphere results in the ozone molecules being unable to absorb ultra-violet radiation. Reports say ozone levels over the northern hemisphere have been dropping by four per cent per decade since the 1980s.\n\nMr Achiula said the National Programme on Montreal Protocol targets capacity building for institutions overseeing the process and to have adequate database on the gravity of the problem.\n\nOther measures include sensitising the business community on the harmful effects of ozone depletion,to promote and adopt the alternative and ozone-friendly technologies as well as training industrial technicians.\n\nAlso under the programme, there would be deliberate efforts to set up centres where the harmful chemicals would be neutralised in refrigerators and air cooling systems. The latter are widely used in areas, which experience high temperatures like Dar es Salaam.\n\nAccording to him, about a half of the remaining hazardous chemicals are used in industrial production and commercial enterprises while 50 per cent is generated by domestic appliances."}
{"text":"Atmospheric Science\n\nOverview\n\nIssue:\n\nAtmospheric scientists study the atmosphere's physical characteristics, its weather patterns or meteorology, and its chemistry. The best known application of this collective knowledge is forecasting the weather.\n\nAtmospheric science is also important to the study of air pollution. At the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Research Program in the Office of Research and Development is leading a research effort to better understand how air pollutants are formed, how they interact with one another, and where they come from and go.\n\nResearch in atmospheric science provides information to EPA, states and others to develop strategies to reduce air pollution and to evaluate the effectiveness of various control measures.\n\nDescribing or characterizing the often complex composition of outdoor (ambient) air pollution and explaining where various pollutants come from is challenging. The complex and dynamic chemistry is often difficult to capture as pollutants vary during different times of the day and by their location.\n\nIntegrated science that includes laboratory and field studies is needed to better understand air pollution. Laboratory studies offer scientists the opportunity to understand the processes associated with the formation and distribution of air pollutants under controlled circumstances. This knowledge is used to develop theory for model development. Field studies are also important in that they provide measurements in real-time that can be used to assess models and develop other scientific tools.\n\nScientific Objective:\n\nScientists in the Clean Air Research Program explore every aspect of the \"life\" of an air pollutant \u2013 from formation and transformation with co-pollutants, to how they are transported and come in contact with humans. Specifically, researchers work to answer questions such as:\n\nWhat are the various sources of air pollutants?\n\nHow do the types of air pollutants form, age, and change in the atmosphere?\n\nHow are air pollutants transformed and transported in the atmosphere?\n\nWhat chemical processes are important in the formation and transformation of air pollution, especially ozone, particulate matter, and air toxics?\n\nHow can air pollution best be monitored? What instruments and techniques are needed to monitor pollutants?\n\nWhat tools can be developed to support efforts to reduce and control air pollution? How can computer models be improved to better represent air pollutants and their related processes in the atmosphere?\n\nHow can the information about pollutant concentrations, fate and transport be included in models to estimate future concentrations?\n\nResearch areas include:\n\nDeveloping and evaluating the Community MultiScale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) for a variety of time and space scales for PM, ozone and air toxics.\n\nUnderstanding the chemistry of pollutants, particularly the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) by learning about their physical properties, and determining their exact chemical composition.\n\nUnderstanding factors and parameters of air pollutants such as concentration, chemical composition, size distribution, and source contribution.\n\nDeveloping and evaluating monitoring methods for implementation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\n\nIdentifying the various sources of a pollutant and determining the amount each source contributes to the outdoor concentration.\n\nApplication and Impact:\n\nThe Clean Air Research Program's air quality research provides a strong scientific foundation for protecting the public from adverse impacts of air pollutants.\n\nThe methods, models, tools, and techniques are used by EPA to make decisions about air quality standards, provide information for conducting health studies and assist states to develop control plans for minimizing pollutants within their air sheds.\n\nAtmospheric research enables air quality managers and regulators to determine what air pollutants are potentially harmful, what emissions should be targeted for reduction and how they can be controlled in the most cost effective and efficient way.\n\nWith the growing evidence of climate change and its expected impacts on air quality, atmospheric science will also provide key information to health effects research. This science will be used to better understand potential health implications of the evolving complexity of ambient air environment.\n\nContact:\n\nDavid Kryak (kryak.david@epa.gov), National Exposure Research Laboratory, EPA's Office of Research and Development, 919-541-1457.\n\nSherri Hunt (hunt.sherri@epa.gov), National Center for Environmental Research, EPA's Office of Research and Development, 202-343-9644.\n\nModeling\n\nIssue\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets and enforces national air quality standards to protect public health. Pollutants are generated by many sources from factories and power plants to motor vehicles and wildfires. These pollutants can travel thousands of miles across state and international borders.\n\nPollutants mixed from various sources in the atmosphere may interact with one another, especially in sunlight, causing the formation of new chemicals. Air pollution can even be exacerbated by the interaction of man-made chemicals with naturally occurring organic emissions from trees, crops, and other vegetation.\n\nTo assist states in implementing air pollution standards, scientific tools are needed such as atmospheric computer models that can be used to determine how best to reduce or mitigate pollution and improve air quality. Such state-of-the-art modeling is critical to understanding the impacts of pollutants in today's complex atmosphere.\n\nAir quality models are needed to help risk assessors determine if the actions they take today will result in reduced pollution tomorrow. They are used to protect people from air pollution by forecasting what may happen to the quality of the air under different potential emissions-control strategies and varying weather conditions.\n\nScientific Objective\n\nThe Clean Air Research Program in EPA's Office of Research and Development is advancing air quality models that can simulate the transport and fate (or outcome) of pollutants in the atmosphere. Research is conducted to develop, evaluate, and improve models for use by EPA and states in implementing the air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter.\n\nThe major focus of model development is to improve EPA's Community Multistage Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system for use by EPA as well as its research and regulatory partners. CMAQ combines current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling with multi-processor computing techniques in an open-source framework to deliver fast, technically sound estimates of air pollutants.\n\nThis multistage and multipollutant chemistry-transport model (CTM) permits the assessment not only of a target pollutant but also its interactions with other environmental contaminants. It also enables EPA and its partners to test how well emissions-control strategies reduce air pollutants.\n\nCMAQ workgroups are focused in several areas of research to improve the chemical and physical process representations in the model and to develop refined versions of the model on a regular basis for particular applications. Some of the research focus areas are:\n\nAtmospheric chemistry and aerosols\n\nTwo-way, meteorology-chemical transport modeling\n\nWeather research and forecast model\n\nMultipollutant modeling\n\nAir quality and climate change interactions\n\nModeling resolution to depict local community levels\n\nApplication and Impact\n\nAir quality models are being used by EPA to help formulate national emissions control programs, while states use air quality models to examine the impacts of local emissions control policies on air pollution. In addition, models are being used to examine the longer-range potential impacts of global climate change and rising levels of Asian industrialization on air quality in the United States.\n\nThe CMAQ model, made publicly available through the Community Modeling and Analysis System Center, is used by over 500 groups nationally and internationally to study air pollution issues from both research and air quality management perspectives.\n\nThe model has been used effectively by EPA regulators to assess the impacts of potential new nationwide or regional emissions-control rules to improve air quality.\n\nThe National Weather Service is using the CMAQ model to produce operational daily forecasts for ozone air quality over the continental United States. The model is also used by states to assess implementation actions to attain the air quality standards set by EPA and to assess the interstate transport of air pollution.\n\nThe CMAQ model has been used by scientists to better probe, understand, and simulate chemical and physical interactions in the atmosphere. The complex emissions and chemical interactions of air pollutants from man-made and natural sources have been studied with the model to provide a better understanding on reducible and irreducible pollution levels.\n\nThe CMAQ modeling system is also being used to understand the separate and combined impacts of source emissions and weather\/climate impacts on air quality over the United States.\n\nReferences\n\nByun, D., and K.L. Schere, 2006: Review of the Governing Equations, Computational Algorithms, and Other Components of the Models-3 Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Modeling System. Applied Mechanics Reviews 59:51-77.\n\nChemistry\n\nIssue:\n\nParticulate matter (PM) is an air pollutant that is made up of many different chemical compounds. The specific chemicals in the PM are determined by the pollutant source and even geographic location. While ozone, for example, has the same chemical composition or formula no matter where you find it, PM does not.\n\nPM can be composed of many compounds, including:\n\nInorganic compounds such as sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium, and different elements;\n\nOrganic compounds from the incomplete burning of fuels such as wood, gasoline, and diesel fuel; and\n\nSecondary organic aerosols, or SOAs.\n\nSOAs are created when chemicals from different air pollutants mix and react with one another to form new organic compounds. These new compounds eventually attach themselves to preexisting air particles.\n\nScientists at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are studying the chemistry of PM, particularly the formation of secondary organic aerosols to protect public health. The knowledge can be incorporated into models that are used to estimate air quality and, in turn, the amount of PM that people are exposed to. Researchers are working to learn more about the formation of SOAs, describe or characterize their physical properties, and determine their exact chemical composition when possible.\n\nThere are substantial scientific and technical obstacles to studying the formation of organic matter by chemical processes in the atmosphere. Some of the chemical reactions themselves are poorly understood. Because such a large number of organic products form, many have not yet been identified.\n\nIn addition, there are hundreds of chemicals present from hydrocarbons emitted into the atmosphere. When they react with one another, they produce thousands of different secondary organic aerosols, making it a challenge to determine even a small fraction of these products. Even measuring the total organic mass without regard to chemical identity represents a significant challenge.\n\nScientific Objective:\n\nThe Clean Air Research Program in EPA's Office of Research and Development is conducting atmospheric chemistry research on the small particles known as PM2.5, which are regulated by EPA. The research objective is to understand the major processes that produce SOAs and other important components of PM2.5.\n\nAtmospheric chemistry also provides critical information to support health studies and research to understand the sources of particle pollution.\n\nKey scientific questions being addressed include:\n\nWhat are the main emitted compounds which lead to SOA formation?\n\nWhat fraction of the organic matter in PM comes from natural versus human-made sources?\n\nWhat atmospheric factors such as temperature and season influence SOA formation and to what extent?\n\nApplication and Impact:\n\nFor more than a decade, the Clean Air Research Program has provided innovative science in the field of atmospheric chemistry to understand the properties and chemical components of many SOAs.\n\nEPA funded research is changing the way scientists understand and model organic particles and the formation of SOA in the atmosphere. By identifying the largest sources contributing to PM2.5 and its precursors, the work enables regulators and air quality managers to create more effective control strategies.\n\nResearchers have also developed instruments and techniques to measure particles and their composition. This leads to an improved understanding of particle sources and formation processes. Health scientists value the new information about particle composition as it guides their own studies.\n\nAtmospheric chemistry research has been used to improve air quality models such as EPA's CMAQ model. One of the model features allows regulators and air quality managers to predict secondary organic aerosol concentrations.\n\nThe discoveries are also helping states to develop and implement plans to control particle emissions.\n\nCharacterization\n\nIssue\n\nUnder the Clean Air Act, states are required to operate and maintain air monitoring networks to determine if they are meeting the federal standards for high-priority air pollutants, known as criteria pollutants. One of these pollutants, particulate matter (PM), offers unique challenges to monitoring and regulation because it is the only criteria pollutant that is not defined by its chemical composition.\n\nUnlike an ozone molecule, which is the same wherever it is measured across the country, PM's characteristics vary greatly. Airborne PM comes in many different sizes, ranging from the size of the smallest viruses to larger than the diameter of a human hair. It also comes in a variety of chemical \"flavors,\" meaning chemical properties vary from one particle to the next.\n\nPM's qualities are also defined by the source of the pollutant such as an automobile or industry, and by the changes of seasons, geographic location, or even local meteorological conditions. As a result, particle pollution is different depending on where you live.\n\nResearch to better characterize PM is needed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and others to more accurately identify and define the many different types of PM across the country and to advance the technology to measure, monitor, and control the pollutant.\n\nScientific Objective\n\nScientists in the Clean Air Research Program in EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) are working to understanding the chemical composition, size, and concentration of PM at different locations across the country. They are also studying the origin of the source of PM which will assist state governments with regulating the pollutant and developing more targeted control measures.\n\nWhile some pollutants can be studied in a laboratory, researchers studying the many characteristics of PM must conduct research in outdoor settings across the country to assess the many unique and differing factors that contribute to the creation of particle pollution.\n\nKey questions being addressed include:\n\nWhat air pollutants need to be routinely monitored and controlled to protect public health?\n\nWhat methods are needed to ensure sufficient measurement accuracy and precision of air monitors for each regulated pollutant?\n\nWhat testing requirements and measurement criteria are needed to ensure methods used to obtain data from monitors are accurate?\n\nDevelop and evaluate methods for fine PM2.5 and coarse PM10-2.5 to enable PM measurement with high-time resolution of periods of one hour or less.\n\nDevelop, evaluate, and apply advanced air monitoring methods to identify air pollution sources contributing to non-attainment of the air quality standards in certain areas of the country.\n\nApplication and Impact\n\nThe Clean Air Research Program is uncovering the secrets of PM by defining the many different properties and qualities of the pollutant. Research has led to improved understanding of the characteristics of PM at different locations across the country and is providing critical regulatory support to implement the national air quality standards for PM.\n\nHealth researchers can use the discoveries about the characteristics of PM to study in more detail how the pollutant causes adverse heart and lung effects. In this way, the Clean Air Research Program is providing a source-to-health outcome approach to protecting the public from air pollutants.\n\nAccomplishments:\n\nORD science supported the adoption of testing specifications and acceptance criteria for PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 monitors.\n\nORD developed a method for use by EPA's regulatory programs to measure coarse PM.\n\nSince 2003, ORD science has supported the designation of 19 monitor types that can be used by states to determine if their air is in compliance with federal standards.\n\nORD science led to the designation of new test methods and equivalent methods for PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 monitoring instruments.\n\nSource Apportionment\n\nIssue\n\nHumans are exposed to a number of air pollution sources. Major sources include motor vehicle exhaust, both large and small industries, power plants, agricultural and forest fires, and domestic activities (e.g., lawn mowing).\n\nNumerous health studies have demonstrated an association between air pollution sources and adverse health and environmental effects. Therefore, it is important to know all we can about the sources we are exposed to and the characteristics and concentration of those sources.\n\nFor example, if we know which specific sources contribute to air pollution in a given area, and where people are most likely to be exposed, strategies such as changing fuels or installing air pollution control equipment can be used to reduce the impact of those sources.\n\nSource-related research informs the air pollution control strategies of EPA, state, and local governments for specific sources or categories of sources.\n\nScientific Objective\n\nScientists and engineers in EPA's Clean Air Research Program in the Office of Research and Development (ORD) are identifying and quantifying more clearly the various sources of air pollution to improve EPA's understanding of the links between sources and health effects.\n\nThe focus of this \"source\u2013apportionment\" research is on several sources of air pollutants: fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse PM, regulated gaseous pollutants, volatile organic compounds, and mercury. Research is being conducted across the country and in EPA laboratories to evaluate source emissions, determine where they travel, and learn how people and ecosystems are exposed.\n\nEfforts are underway to advance the sampling and analytical methods to measure specific pollutants in air. The routine measurements collected in areas that are not meeting air quality regulations are typically not sufficient to identify local source contributions.\n\nWork is also underway to improve modeling tools that can be used to identify and quantify the local, urban, and regional sources. The modeling tools are publically available and are used by EPA, state and local governments, as well as academic and international environmental researchers. These models are:\n\nApplication and Impact\n\nThe science developed by the Clean Air Research Program provides information and tools to EPA, states, and local agencies for developing effective air pollution regulations.\n\nRecent advances in the understanding of source contributions to air pollution include:\n\nStudies in Tampa, Fla., showed a reduction in mercury impact when a major power plant changed its fuel from coal to natural gas. In addition, Steubenville, Ohio research demonstrated the large impact of regional domestic coal combustion on the deposition of mercury in rain water.\n\nA study in Baltimore, Md., found that 30 percent of particulate matter (PM) from motor vehicles infiltrated inside a retirement home. The indoor level reflected the PM pollution from local coal fire power plants (sulfate). Another study in Research Triangle Park, N.C., found around 50 percent of PM from motor vehicle exhaust was present inside homes and that cooking was a major contributor to PM personal exposure.\n\nWorld Trade Center research results showed differences in air pollution sources during the different stages of the recovery effort after 9\/11.\n\nIn St. Louis, studies at a major steel facility helped quantify the impact of various industrial sources on local areas.\n\nThis research underlines the importance of tracking specific sources in exposure assessments and using the results to improve control strategies.\n\nReferences\n\n\"Chemical Characterization of Ambient Particulate Matter near the World Trade Center: Source Apportionment using Organic and Inorganic Source Markers,\" Atmos.

{"text":"Air pollution advisory issued for southern Minn.\n\nWORTHINGTON, Minn. \u2014\nThe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency is watching a stagnant weather pattern over southern Minnesota that is increasing air pollution.\n\nThe MPCA has issued an air advisory through midday Saturday for the southern two-thirds of Minnesota because of increased levels of fine-particle pollution. There's not enough wind to disperse the particles, and the snow melt adds to the problem.\n\nCassie McMahon, air pollution research analyst for the MPCA, said that added moisture in the air tends to hold pollution in place. The bad air could cause problems for certain groups, she said.\n\n\"That includes people with pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular disease,\" McMahon said.\n\nFine-particle pollution is produced mainly from combustion, including vehicle or equipment exhaust and wood burning."}
{"text":"For those with a keen eye, you may have spotted a red balloon soaring high above the EGU Centre this week. The little white box attached underneath is the Light Optical Aerosol Counter (LOAC), a device that has been measuring the aerosols it the air around the conference.\n\nAerosols are air borne particles that can be liquid or solid, natural or manmade. Salt, fog, sand, plaster and carbon are common aerosols found in the air.\n\nStudies have shown particles less than 2.5 micrometres (mm) and 10 mm can be detrimental to human health as they are small enough to get into your lungs and enter your cells. An average human hair for example is about 200 mm. Regulations set thresholds for the amount of a particular particle size that should be in the air we breathe.\n\nLOAC is an optical instrument that sends a beam of light through particles and the way the light scatters determines the size and shape. From this, the scientists can work out if the aerosol is carbon, mineral or liquid.\n\nEGU GeoLog reporters managed to catch up with Jean-Baptiste Renard to explain his experiment this week\u2026\n\nSo what did you find in the air around the EGU?\n\nIndoor air pollution was worse than outside. On Wednesday as it was too windy outside to fly; we flew the balloon in the exhibition hall. Particle levels sized10 mm (the dangerous kind) were at least five times more inside, almost reaching the threshold of alert levels.\n\nThese particles come from our clothes, in our hair, the dirt we scuff on the floor, is all lifted back up into the air. We are full of dust!\n\nOutside, the concentration changed a lot during the day. In the morning there was a lot of carbon measured, possibly from the traffic that you would expect in a big city or the direction of the wind.\n\nMeasurements in the afternoon showed more mineral particles. This may be because of all of the building work going on in the towers on the right of the conference centre entrance. Every time someone uses a saw or hammer, tiny particles are produced and we can measure them in the air.\n\nIn the morning there is more carbon, and in the afternoon more minerals. Graphs: Jean-Baptiste Renard.\n\nBut won't they measure the same \u2013 on the ground or in the sky?\n\nNo \u2013 the ground level concentration of aerosols can be completely different to 100 meters in the air. The higher you are, the greater more mixture of aerosols you find because up there, the particles that have been transported from elsewhere. At ground level, it is much more localised and the aerosols present are specific to what is close by.\n\nIs that what's so great about LOAC, you can put it on a balloon?\n\nThe key to LOAC is that it is airborne. As it is so small and lightweight, it can be attached to any kind of balloon. Before, the instruments had to be attached to planes or much larger balloons. Now, we can accurately trace if particles are locally produced or if the conditions in a small area, say on a specific street, are reaching an unhealthy threshold.\n\nBeing able to measure particles less than 1 mm is also totally new. We can distinguish between aerosols too. Before LOAC, instruments had to be set to detect a certain particle in the air, say salt. You would need to calibrate to look for salt. If there were no particles in the air, there would be no results, but now we can use one piece of equipment for multiple measurements, we can always collect data!\n\nToday we feature a guest post by Mona Behl, a Visiting Fellow at the American Meteorological Society. Mona provides a review of the current Mars mission, including an overview of the revolutionary instruments featured aboard the Curiosity rover.\n\n\"The fence we walked between the years did balance us serene. It was a place half in the sky wearing the green of leaf and promising of peach. We'd reach our hand and touch and almost touch the sky. If we could reach and touch we said, it would teach us not to, never to, be dead.\" \u2013 Ray Bradbury, If Only We Had Been Taller\n\nPanorama of Curiosity on the surface of the Red Planet. (Credit: NASA\/JPL-Caltech\/Malin Space Science Systems\n\nNovember 1971 marked a major milestone in the great era of space exploration as the Mariner 9 made history by being the first spacecraft to orbit another planet. Just days before the orbiter reached Mars, Ray Bradbury gave an almost spiritual inflection to the mission with his poem, If Only We Had Been Taller.\n\nBradbury Landing\n\nSixty-two years after the publication of The Martian Chronicles, the late author's most enduring book on science fiction came one step closer to becoming a fact. After eight years of planning and 555 million km of interplanetary travel in eight months, NASA's most ambitious Mars exploration rover, called Curiosity, touched down inside the Gale crater on the Martian surface on 5 August 2012. Mars has a very thin atmosphere and a gravitational pull of only 38% that of Earth's; however, even under such severe conditions, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) succeeded in every step of arguably the most complex landing ever attempted. In honor of the iconic writer, NASA named Curiosity's landing site the Bradbury Landing.\n\nCuriosity is about twice as long and five times as heavy as the Spirit and Opportunity rovers from earlier US Mars missions, and it carries over ten times their mass in scientific instruments. For the next 23 months (one Martian year), Curiosity, powered by radioactive plutonium, will roll around the red planet zapping rocks with its laser and analyzing soil by way of its onboard lab. Its mission is to search for water and look for possible signs of past life.\n\nThe Gale crater is around 6.5 km from the base of Mount Sharp, also known as Aeolis Mons, Curiosity's eventual destination. Scientists estimate that the crater was formed by an impact roughly 3.8 billion years ago. The strata created by this impact depict layered rock formations that tell us a lot about the geological history of the planet. The layers of sediment contain different minerals that provide details of the chemistry and chemical alterations that are associated with life. Clay can be found near the bottom of the mound and, above that, layers are laced with sulfur and, even further up, by oxygen-bearing minerals. Such a layered rock formation, called an alluvian fan, is formed when water runs out of a canyon or riverbed and spreads out, scattering sediment and smaller bits of rocks. Curiosity will carefully navigate its way up the Mons, investigating the various sediment layers in order to understand the environment in which they were formed.\n\nUnprecedented range of instruments\n\nThe rover is equipped with 17 cameras that shoot high-definition photos and video in black and white, colour, and 3-D stereo. The Mars Descent Imager, a 2-megapixel wide-angle camera mounted toward the front of Curiosity's port side, faces the ground and has two objectives: to determine where exactly the MSL vehicle landed and to provide a geologic and engineering framework of the landing site for early operations. It came to life when the spacecraft's heat shield jettisoned as it plunged through Mars atmosphere, firing up a rocket powered platform, lowering the rover to its landing site. An atmospheric sensor, called the MSL Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrument (MEDLI), protected the rover throughout its descent towards the Red Planet.\n\nThe equivalent of the geologist's hand lens, sitting on the end of the rover's robotic arm, is the Mars Hand Lens Imager. This is a self focusing, roughly 4 cm-wide camera, that will take colour images of features as small as 12.5 micrometres across, smaller than the diameter of a human hair. This camera will provide close-up images of Martian rocks and soil. Data obtained from MEDLI will be used to improve designs for future Mars-bound spacecraft.\n\nSitting about two metres above the surface on the rover's main workhorse are the two mast cameras. These cameras are the left and right 'eyes' of the rover that can focus on objects and see details as small as a few hundred microns across.\n\nA mobile geology lab\n\nThe bulk of Curiosity is made up of a microwave oven-sized instrument called the Sample Analysis at Mars, which is in fact a suite of three instruments \u2013 a mass spectrometer, a gas chromatograph, and a laser spectrometer \u2013 that will investigate past and present ability of Mars to support life. In addition, there are three more spectrometers called the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer, the Chemistry and Camera spectrometer, and the Chemistry and Mineralogy spectrometer. Each of these provides information and analysis of the various rocks, minerals, and chemical elements.\n\nThe rover also has two radiation hunting instruments, the Radiation Assessment Detector and the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons. While the former instrument will measure and identify high energy radiation of all types on the Red Planet, the latter will help the rover search for ice and water-logged minerals beneath the Martian surface.\n\nThe Rover Environmental Monitoring Station, located on the neck-like mast of the rover, serves as Curiosity's weather station. It is set to measure atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction, air temperature, ground temperature, and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nSince over a month, Curiosity has been sending back coloured images from the surface of the Red Planet. So far, it has also driven approximately 90 m. It has already started analyzing its surroundings by zapping a 2.5-cm wide rock called Coronation, the first rock on any extraterrestrial planet to be investigated with such a laser test. The rover is headed towards a spot called Glenelg, where three different types of terrain come together in one place. Mount Sharp, Curiosity's eventual destination, is where the rover will carry out much of its investigation into the planet's terrain.\n\nToday GeoLog features a guest post by Mona Behl, a Visiting Fellow at the American Meteorological Society. Mona explains why Earth observation satellites are so important and why the future of Earth observations, sciences and services might be at risk.\n\nThe year 1957 marked the birth of Sputnik I, the world's first artificial satellite to be launched in space. This launch ushered in an exciting era of growth and change in science. Over the past 50 years, the advent of Earth observation systems (including ground, oceanic, atmospheric, and satellite-based resources) has truly revolutionized the way we see our planet. Satellites are not only our \"windows to the universe\"; they also provide a unique and revolutionary vantage point from space with global images and data about the Earth and its environment. The exploration, exploitation and application of satellite data drive Earth observations, science and services (OSS) and society as a whole.\n\nHowever, the fate of Earth OSS appears to be in peril.\n\nA recent report by the American Meteorological Society points out that federal budget deficits and economic downturn are putting a strong hold on building and maintaining Earth OSS. The findings of this report stem from a workshop held by the AMS Policy Program. Describing the technological advances is relatively easy compared to measuring the economic and social benefits of Earth OSS. This study reveals the importance of Earth OSS and how it is integrated into the very fabric of our society.\n\nWhereas space-based observations provide a major contribution to the Earth observation system, observations that are based on land, air and sea are important and provide us with an accurate, global, yet independent view of the Earth. Our society faces a number of challenges today. We rely on Earth OSS not only for increasing the accuracy and breadth of weather information, forecasting and warnings, but also for improving the management and protection of terrestrial, coastal, and marine ecosystems. To understand, assess, predict, mitigate, and adapt to the changing climate, Earth OSS is important. Observation-based data not only serves the government but also has immense private, academic, nonprofit, and public use. From national security to providing information and understanding about environmental factors affecting human health to water resource management, to combating desertification and promoting sustainable agriculture, Earth OSS are imperative to our well-being.\n\nDespite the importance and interconnectedness of Earth OSS to society, why does its future still look grim?\n\nAnother study conducted by the U.S. National Research Council concludes that, in the near term, budgets for NASA's science program will remain inadequate to meet the country's pressing needs. As a result, the U.S. may have to rely on data from European or other satellites.\n\nHowever, Europe seems to be headed for a crash as well. In April this year, the European Space Agency declared the demise of Envisat, the world's largest Earth observation spacecraft. Envisat contributed valuable information to Europe's Global Monitoring for Environmental Security program by providing measurements of atmospheric chemistry, rising sea levels, plate tectonics, greenhouse gas emissions, and land subsidence. The end of this mission is likely to lead to significant gaps in satellite data.\n\nEnvisat (Credit: ESA)\n\nThe decline of Earth OSS may be a beacon of a future calamity.\n\nThe quality of life, as well as the ability to protect our nations, manage our environment, and adapt to a changing climate are all dependent on the use of the Earth observation systems. Given the enormous potential benefits that Earth OSS affords humankind, society faces a need to rethink priorities and put a concerted effort into ensuring the adequacy and continuity of Earth OSS over the short, intermediate, and longer term.\n\nOne of the key recommendations the AMS report makes is to foster private-public collaborations in order to improve and expand Earth OSS. Interagency participation in addition to private-public collaborations is required not only at a national level but at the international level as well. For years, the science and technology communities have discussed and understood the need to link our Earth to its observation systems. However, to ensure the success and growth of our Earth OSS, investment in sound government policies is critical.\n\nThe need to monitor and observe the Earth's environment is now more urgent than ever.\n\nHi again from Vienna, and Day 3 of the EGU's General Assembly. Hope you're enjoying reading the blogs!\n\nMy previous post focussed on the deep, damp world of the subglacial environment; today, I'm gaining considerable altitude and talking to Dr Lindsey Nicholson (University of Innsbruck) about her growing interest in debris-covered mountain glaciers, and learning from some of the researchers in her debris-dedicated session.\n\nIn my own experiences of Arctic geophysics, glaciers are usually pristine: covered by fresh snow, and easily traversed by snowshoe, ski or snowmobile. As ever, though, variety is the spice of life and there are some glaciers that are altogether\u2026rockier. In fact, many mountain glaciers lurk beneath a mantle of fallen rocks and this provides them with a uniquely complex set of characteristics. A geophysical survey on a glacier that's strewn with rocks strikes me as a particularly taxing problem \u2013 it's difficult to tow a radar system across a boulder field, or to install a seismic line in solid rock \u2013 so I was interested to learn more about alternate methods of studying debris-covered glaciers.\n\n\"There's a growing interest in debris-covered glaciers,\" Lindsey tells me. \"In the last few years, they have really come to the fore since we've realised how little we know about them.\" The more I talk to Lindsey, the more I realise that debris-covered glaciers really are a law unto themselves. In general, physical descriptions of 'clean-ice' glaciers, of their motion and the energy that is supplied to them, often work pretty well. Unfortunately, give a glacier a debris-cover and it's a whole different beast. For example, an initial dusting of debris exacerbates glacier melt \u2013 the debris absorbs more solar radiation, warms up, and ends up delivering more heat to the glacier. However, when that debris exceeds a certain critical thickness (e.g., after piling-up successive rockfalls), it acts as a sunscreen and glacier melting is reduced (the talk of Martin Juen of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, Germany, was dedicated to understanding the controls on this). Lindsey's experience suggests that there might be a veritable mountain to climb: \"Our current understanding doesn't capture the full complexity of the system. The old processes need to be modified, adapted, or reinvented.\"\n\nA major boost in our understanding is provided by Pierre-Marie Lefeuvre, formerly an MSc student at the University of Sheffield (UK), now a PhD student at the University of Oslo (Norway). In collaboration with Dr Felix Ng, Pierre-Marie has developed a computational method that offers new understandings of the coupling between debris-cover and glacier-flow model. The model predicts that, as a debris-covered glacier starts to melt, the relative area of its debris cover becomes larger; as the glacier wastes away, previously-buried rockfalls become exposed and linger on the surface. Differences in debris cover can even cause a glacier to split, with a lower section stranded from its higher-altitude counterpart. Future predictive models will undoubtedly be indebted to the pioneering steps of Pierre-Marie's work, and he advises that we keep an eye out for an imminent publication.\n\nBut even seeing a debris-covered glacier can be problematic. Normally, glaciologists would delineate clean-glacier ice using remotely-sensed satellite images: however, distinguishing a debris-covered glacier from \u2013 say \u2013 a debris-covered mountainside is understandably tricky. Fortunately, Dr Adina Racoviteanu (post-doc, LGGE Grenoble, funded by CNES France) is something of a remote-sensing revolutionary. In recent research she has developed algorithms that are able to predict whether surface debris cover is underlain by ice\u2026or just more debris. The image below shows the results of this method (recently published in the journal Sensors), in which the red areas clearly demarcate the extent of the debris-covered glacier.\n\nDefining debris-cover\u2026 Adina Racoviteanu's work allows debris-covered glaciers to be identified from satellite data. Ice is most-likely located beneath the bright-red areas.\n\nEven more inspiring is that the next step in this research \u2013 classification of features based on their surface texture \u2013 is inspired by processes developed in medical science! Textural data, derived from ASTER and Quickbird satellite images, are combined with surface topography and temperature records to define the edges of the debris-covered glacier. This work, Adina tells me, will be a big step towards quantifying how much melt is occurring beneath a glacier's debris cover.\n\nMy conversation with Lindsey now moves specifically towards Himalayan glaciers. In addition to their current contribution to sea-level rise, changes to Himalayan glaciers are associated with other significant humanitarian effects. On one hand, the glacier is a valuable resource, often representing the only resource of fresh water for an isolated Himalayan community. On the other, pooled meltwater can catastrophically break out of confining debris layers, flooding villages and destroying valuable agricultural land \u2013 and such unstable terrain also deters investment in economic, local-scale hydraulic power plants. However, a key difficulty in predicting the behaviour of Himalayan glaciers is the natural variability over an enormous geographical scale: \"East-west, north-south,\" Lindsey says, \"the Himalayas are completely different. Accurately extrapolating observations across such wide areas is clearly problematic.\"\n\nDuring the session's poster presentations, I happened across UNIS's Professor Doug Benn. \"Five years ago,\" he told me, \"we had no idea of how mountain glaciers were changing. Since then, we've really come on leaps and bounds.\" The vibrancy in the community really echoes his words. I'm by no means a specialist in high-altitude glaciology, but I left the session enthused with the feeling that many more key breakthroughs are just around the corner. There might be a mountain to climb, but I really think I've just met the people to climb it new EGU Journal has been launched: Geoscientific Instrumentation, Methods and Data Systems (GI).

{"text":"Mercury Emissions: The Global Context\n\nMercury emissions are a global problem that knows no national or continental boundaries. Mercury that is emitted to the air can travel thousands of miles in the atmosphere before it is eventually deposited back to the earth in rainfall or in dry gaseous form.\n\nTypes of Sources\n\nNatural sources of mercury include volcanic eruptions and emissions from the ocean. Anthropogenic (human-caused) emissions include mercury that is released from fuels or raw materials, or from uses in products or industrial processes.\n\nSome of the mercury circulating through today's environment was released years ago. Land, water, and other surfaces can repeatedly re-emit mercury into the atmosphere after its initial release into the environment. We know that anthropogenic emissions continue to add significantly to the global pool of mercury.\n\nWorldwide Emissions\n\nHow much mercury is emitted worldwide each year? Recent estimates of annual global mercury emissions from both natural and anthropogenic sources are in the range of 5,000 to 8,000 metric tons per year. These estimates include mercury that is re-emitted. The world map and the bar graph below provide information about the worldwide distribution of anthropogenic mercury emissions."}
{"text":"Pollution of Puget Sound appears to be coming increasingly from ordinary, everyday citizens driving around in their cars rather than industrial polluters, a state study released Monday says.\n\nThe study summed up the results of tests on mud and sand at the bottom of Puget Sound over a 12-year period. Toxic metals thought to be associated with industrial polluters waned, while a class of chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, increased.\n\nThe second class of chemicals comes mostly from burning coal and petroleum, particularly car exhaust.\n\n\"This serves to put up a red flag for highly important issues that are happening,\" said Maggie Dutch, a state Department of Ecology scientist who studies marine sediments. \"It's a really important thing to know that the levels of these compounds are increasing, and it's probably associated with people driving.\"\n\nPAHs can get from a car's tailpipe into the Sound in basically two ways: Either they drift around until they fall directly into the water, or they land on the ground and are washed by rain into the Sound or its tributaries.\n\nEcology's findings mirror those of researchers nationwide with the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nAs the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act slashed pollution spewing from smokestacks and waste-discharge pipes over the past three decades, levels of toxic metals have fallen and PAHs have increased.\n\nIt all adds up to yet another reason to drive as little as possible, Ecology says.\n\n\"It's happening with some regularity that we're getting some sources of pollution under control and others are getting worse at the same time,\" Ecology Director Jay Manning said. \"The kind of pollution that's getting worse, it's probably because of a lot of repetitive activities by people like you and I.\"\n\nThe testing began in 1989. The most recent results were from 2000. More testing has continued, although results are not yet available. Sediments were scooped up at 10 sites -- stretching from Bellingham to Shilshole Bay to the Olympia area.\n\nThe report is one of a series of results of the state's multiyear pollution-monitoring programs for the Sound.\n\nEric Crecilius of the Batelle Marine Science Lab in Sequim, who was not involved in the Ecology study but has studied the evolution of pollution in Puget Sound sediments, said Ecology's hypothesis about the source of the PAH increase makes sense.\n\nOriginally PAHs spiked in the 1930s and 1940s as a result of people burning coal, he said. But as oil and later electricity replaced coal, PAH levels subsided, Crecilius said.\n\nOverall, the Sound's sediments have grown cleaner over the past half-century or so, he said, partly because of the crackdown on pollution and partly because of the use of cleaner energy sources.\n\nA reverse during the 1990s probably happened, he said, because \"there's just more of us. ... I don't have anything to argue against that.\"\n\nPAHs are just one component of a polluted mess that washes off the urban landscape in the Pacific Northwest's legendary rains.\n\nHere, pavement contractors are using an asphalt-based parking lot sealant, he said, rather than the coal tar-based variety singled out by the Austin researchers as having the highest PAH levels.\n\n\"To my knowledge, there is no supplier of (coal-tar sealant) in the Seattle area,\" Sebaaly said.\n\nHis group has resisted what it calls the singling out of parking-lot sealants as PAH sources, because PAHs come from so many products, including car exhaust, roads -- even tires.\n\nHowever, the report published earlier this summer in the journal Environmental Science & Technology said PAH levels on asphalt-sealed parking lots are about 10 times higher than those coming off unsealed asphalt or concrete parking lots.\n\nThe sealants provide a less expensive way to refinish a parking lot. They can be sprayed or painted on, as opposed to the much more involved process of laying down a whole new coat of asphalt.\n\nDavid Johns, a co-author of the paper, said asphalt sealants are a source of PAHs, but the pollution runs off those surfaces at about one-tenth the rate it comes off the lots covered by coal-tar sealants."}

When appliances and furnaces\nare improperly adjusted and used in poorly ventilated areas,\ndangerous amounts of CO can build up in the blood, replacing the\noxygen, and potentially cause asphyxiation.\n\nRecognizing CO Poisoning Symptoms\n\nAlthough everyone is susceptible to CO poisoning, unborn babies,\ninfants, the elderly, and people with respiratory problems are\nparticularly at risk. Because CO is invisible and odorless, it is\nimportant to know the symptoms of CO poisoning and to immediately\nseek medical help if those symptoms occur.\n\nThe most common symptoms are:\n\n\" persistent, severe headaches and dizziness (usually affecting\nmore than one person in an enclosed area).\n\n\" nausea, vomiting and fatigue.\n\n\" the disappearance of symptoms when individuals leave the\nstructure.\n\nIf the presence of CO is suspected based on these symptoms,\nevacuate all persons from the structure and call the poison control\ncenter at 1-800-222-1222, or 911.\n\nCO Prevention\n\nPeople can avoid CO poisoning through simple prevention measures\nand common sense. For example, most fire-related CO poisoning can\nbe prevented by the proper installation and maintenance of smoke\ndetectors. Here are some other tips for preventing CO\npoisoning:\n\n\" Have your heating system, water heater, and any other gas-,\noil-, or coal-burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician\nevery year.\n\n\" Install a battery-operated, Underwriters Laboratory approved,\nCO detector on each level of your home. Check or replace the\nbattery when you change the time on your clocks each spring and\nfall. Installing a CO monitor should never be a substitute for a\nprofessional inspection of home heating and cooking equipment.\nOwners of boats and recreational vehicles with propane stoves or\nheaters should install CO detectors.\n\n\" If your CO detector alarms continuously, evacuate your home\nand call 911 or your local gas company. If the alarm is only\nintermittent, change the batteries. If anyone has symptoms\nimmediately call the poison control center at 800-222-1222 or\n911."}

{"text":"More than two years after the Nevada Legislature passed the Indoor Clean Air Act, a UNLV and University of Kentucky study has found unsafe levels of air pollution due to secondhand smoke in Las Vegas Valley casino restaurants.\n\nUNLV associate professor of nursing Nancy York and Kiyoung Lee, associate professor of public health at the University of Kentucky, measured the air quality of 16 casinos -- eight on the Strip and eight off the Strip. The testing was done on the casino floor and in restaurant areas.\n\nWhile the study found all restaurant areas had lower secondhand smoke levels than gaming areas, it found 12 of the 16 casinos had restaurant areas with air pollution levels exceeding Environmental Protection Agency standards.\n\nNine were at levels deemed unsafe for anyone. Three of the 12 exceeded levels recommended by the EPA as safe for children, the elderly and people with lung diseases.\n\nA UNLV graduate assistant entered the casinos with a device called a sidepack, which takes in continuous air samples. Samples were taken between 1 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Thursdays through Saturdays between November 2007 and March 2008.\n\nAir samples were taken in gaming areas and non-smoking restaurants in the casinos. York sent the data to Lee at Kentucky to analyze.\n\nThe result: All 16 gaming areas that were tested exceeded levels that the EPA deemed safe. York said they found no statistical difference between Strip casinos and those off the Strip.\n\n\"These findings have serious life-threatening consequences for casino employees and patrons,\" York said in a statement. \"Previous research has found smoke-filled casinos can have up to 50 times more cancer-causing particles in the air than highways and city streets during rush-hour traffic. Our research helps to confirm this.\"\n\nAlthough the casinos are not in violation of the Nevada Indoor Clean Air Act, York said the elderly, small children and people with cardiac or lung problems increase their risk of becoming ill the longer they are exposed to secondhand smoke. The Clean Air Act prohibits smoking in all indoor space in the state, with the exception of areas that are prohibited to minors.\n\n\"The casinos are not breaking any laws whatsoever but it's important for people to understand that just because there's no smoking going on in certain parts of casinos, they still may be exposed to secondhand smoke,\" York said.\n\nMaria Azzarelli, coordinator of tobacco control programs at the Southern Nevada Health District, said she has received calls from casino companies about how to make certain areas smoke-free, such as poker rooms and gaming sections. Azzarelli said the only way to combat secondhand smoke is to make the entire facility smoke-free.\n\n\"The fact that the secondhand smoke permeated through to the restaurants in the casino areas wasn't a surprise since many of those restaurants are totally open and there's no barrier,\" Azzarelli said. \"Even if there was a barrier, we would expect that secondhand smoke would enter into the facility, although it would be reduced.\"\n\nThe study doesn't identify the 16 casinos that were tested. Officials with three large gaming companies said they didn't want to comment because they didn't know if any of their properties were included.\n\nNevada Resort Association President Bill Bible said most casinos hire environmental engineers, but he didn't know if casinos have done secondhand smoke testing on their own.\n\n\"I would think that if you went into more modern properties, there has been a lot of emphasis in recent years on air handling equipment and ventilation, so they are generally going to have more sophisticated ventilation requirements in newer properties,\" Bible said.\n\nAzzarelli disagrees.\n\n\"Sometimes some of the gaming properties report that they have an innovative, top-of-the-line ventilation system. Well, the ventilation companies themselves have stated the systems cannot remove secondhand smoke, so ventilation isn't really an option,\" she said.\n\nThe study doesn't push for any action to taken, such as a ban on smoking in casinos. Bible said such a ban would greatly affect visitor numbers and the overall economy.\n\n\"The casino business is a business that caters to the wishes of our customers. If our customers did not desire to be able to smoke in a casino, I've got to believe that smoking would be banned in casinos across the board,\" he said. \"A lot of customers, because we are in a global economy, come from places around the world where there is a heavy tradition of smoking.\"\n\nBible said he believes the study will provoke debate, most likely in the Legislature. York agrees.\n\n\"There are smoke-free laws going into affect for casinos across the nation,\" York said. \"Whether or not the state Legislature or Nevada public wants to change our law, this is data for them to make an informed decision smoking law is a joke, anyway. At the casino I go to, there is a \"u\" shaped bar right beside the restaurant. No walls of any kind. Half the bar is non-smoking, and the other half is smoking. Wide open. So to think that the restaurant is smoke free is sad. But you know what they say-In Vegas, the smokers die first, then the drinkers, and finally-the boring people.\n\nThe smoking nazis got a lot of momentum from global headlines based on their junk science and lies.\n\nExcept for enjoying the occasional cigar the last five years I've been a non-smoker all of my life. My resentment lies in the basics of this controversy -- outlawing something that's been perfectly legal for centuries. This country's attorneys general won billions in anti-smoking lawsuits based on the legal fiction -- the tobacco companies are liable for the warned-of since the 60s consequences people voluntarily undertook.\n\nNow the smoke nazis are taking their agenda onto private property. Just another example of the police state expanding.\n\nKillerB wrote, \"My resentement lies in the basics of the controversy -- outlawing something that's been perfectly legal for centuries.\"\n\nThat's a crazy arguement. Slavery was 'perfectly' legal for centuries...are you saying we should have kept that legal?\n\nTalk to those whose parents, brothers, aunts, etc. have died from lung cancer or emphysema. Tell them that the science behind the dangers of cigarette smoke is 'junk'. See what kind of response you get.\n\nBetter yet, why don't you educate yourself and see what the tobacco industry itself says about their product and its dangers. \n\nHere's a novel idea - if you don't want to put up with second hand smoke levels in casino restaurants then DON'T EAT THERE - my lord - is there no place else in this town to eat except inside a casino restaurant? I don't smoke but still I say GIVE IT A REST ALREADY!!\n\nHere's some 'freedoms' our country allows us - The freedom to own our own business (but not to run it as we see fit - ie: allowing someone to partake in a LEGAL substance)\n\nThe freedom to own our own home (but not to decide, should we choose to rent it out, who to rent it to or who NOT to rent it to - )\n\nJust a couple examples but I say if the government insists on being a (not so) silent partner in my undertakings the least they could do is kick in some bucks for their 'ownership' of MY business, home etc.\n\nWhether one is a smoker or not is not the problem - the problem is the government sticking its' nose in another persons business as it pertains to LEGAL substances - and an even bigger problem exists with some people not seeing anything wrong with government doing that!\n\nFor once and for all if the government thinks tobacco is so bad they should make it ILLEGAL - but heaven forbid where would they get campaign funds to replace those they will lose from the tobacco industry? Hypocrits - politicians - one and the same.\n\nIt is funny to read how many think that a smoking ban will help business, here in Pa it actually hurt. January 15, 2008 The Meadows Racetrack & Casino joined Pennsylvania's other slots parlors yesterday by winning permission to double its space where smoking is allowed, taking up half of the casino.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board accepted a plan from The Meadows.\n\nSmoking will be prohibited in the casino's second room, which is in the rear of the facility in a separate structure connected by passageways.\n\nBecause of the amount of smoking typically seen in casinos and the state's reliance on revenue from them, the slots operators won an exemption in Pennsylvania's Clean Indoor Air Act, which took effect in September. Initially, they were allowed to keep 25 percent of their slots area open to smokers.\n\nThe law enabled casinos to apply after 90 days to expand their smoking areas to as much as 50 percent if their smoking-permitted slot machines were generating more revenue on a daily basis than the smoking-prohibited slots.\n\nPennsylvania Revenue Department figures by December showed a significant difference in revenue between the smoking and nonsmoking areas in all seven of the casinos, and all of them applied for expansion to 50 percent. The machines in the one-quarter of The Meadows where smoking was allowed generated more than twice as much revenue, about $544 daily compared with $269 for slots in nonsmoking sections.\n\nThe Meadows has 1,825 slot machines, and somewhat more than half of them will actually be available to smokers because the smoking-allowed room has more machines than the casino's rear section. The law permits smoking on 50 percent of the gaming floor, which, depending on the layout, can actually include more than half of the machines.\n\nNo decision has been made on how smokers and nonsmokers will be separated in the permanent casino of The Meadows to open in the spring, Mr. LaTorre said. It will have one large room with space for nearly 4,000 slot machines.\n\nAnd let me get this right....THEY PAID MONEY ON A STUDY TO FIND OUT THE OBVIOUS? Come-on now, pay me that kind of money, and I too will show you the obvious! Man who \"sponsored\" this? This is like over stating the obvious.\n\nMore than 50 studies show that human papillomaviruses cause over ten times more lung cancers than they pretend are caused by secondhand smoke. Passive smokers are more likely to have been exposed to this virus, so the anti-smokers' studies, because they are all based on nothing but lifestyle questionnaires, have been cynically DESIGNED to falsely blame passive smoking for all those extra lung cancers that are really caused by HPV.\n\nThe anti-smokers have committed the same type of fraud with every disease they blame on smoking and passive smoking, as well as ignoring other types of evidence that proves they are lying, such as the fact that the death rates from asthma have more than doubled since their movement began.\n\nI'm considered a high roller and receive comps from most of the major strip hotels. Smoking makes me tired and quite ill which means I usually don't stay long in any one casino. If they knew I do most my playing in states between two countries where it is banned perhaps they would look for ways to accommodate people like me. I'm sure the casinos wouldn't be receptive to changing their policies at this time because of fear of losing more clientele in this economic climate; however, it appears that banning smoking has little long term effect on profits after the initial resistance. Gamblers will gamble and Vegas will remain the top draw in North America. The initial reaction will be for smokers to seek out places where it's not banned which is why for it to work it has to be at least statewide. I don't think this will ever happen without government intervention for health reasons because the overseas high rollers are the source of a significant amount of profit. As far as foreign nationals go I may be in the minority"}

{"text":"Features\n\nDust in the wind\n\nAnyone who listened to the urgency of the Environmental Protection Agency's announcement late last year that it will toughen standards for particulate emissions from American industry might think airborne particulates (mostly dust) were a serious and growing health hazard. Not so. Not only do particulates constitute a low risk to Americans' health compared with such routine risks as driving across town or stepping out of the bathtub, but also they are a shrinking health hazard.\n\nAirborne particulate concentrations were only about two-fifths as high in 1994 as they were in 1976. Indeed, they had fallen by nearly 11 percent just since 1990. And improving industrial emissions-control technology promises the continuation of that trend.\n\nThis trend is representative of American air pollution trends in general. They are sharply downward. In the 19 years from 1976 through 1994, carbon monoxide concentrations fell 55 percent; ozone 27 percent; sulfur dioxide 53 percent; particulates 58 percent; nitrogen dioxide 29 percent; and lead, the most dangerous air pollutant, 97 percent, according to the EPA's own figures.\n\nIn fact, the worst years in American history for air pollution were the late 1960s and early 1970s. Since then, emission and concentration trends for all significant air pollutants have been downward. (The same is true of water pollutants.) Indeed, since 1988 none of the measures has violated the standard set by the EPA for protection of public health. (See graph.)\n\nSuch trends shouldn't surprise anyone who believes the economist's rule of thumb: \"You get what you pay for.\" From 1973 to 1993, annual expenditures for air pollution abatement rose by 45 percent, from $18.2 billion to $26.6 billion, and for water pollution abatement by 65 percent, from $19.7 billion to $32.6 billion, in constant 1987 dollars.\n\nBut this doesn't necessarily mean that spending more money to reduce emissions even further makes good sense. Risks to health and life from air and water pollution in the United States are already extremely low, and risks might well be reduced much more by every new dollar spent for other purposes-say, highway safety and reductions in alcohol, tobacco, and drug use-than if that same dollar were spent for further pollution abatement.\n\nFor the last two decades, the EPA has acted as if every tougher regulation were self-evidently good. But an independent review that it sponsored concluded that the EPA lacked sound scientific and economic methods and standards for determining whether the benefit from new regulations it wants to impose will match or exceed the costs. Considerations like those above, coupled with that finding, should lead Congress to insist that any further tightening of EPA pollution control regulations must pass tough tests for cost\/benefit analysis."}

These particles are less than 2.5 micrometers (25\/10,000th of a millimeter) in size. Dockery said larger particles such as airborne dust and debris from farming, construction work and mining are far less likely to trigger a heart attack.\n\nThese particles are so small that after being inhaled, they can evade the normal defense mechanisms in the lungs and penetrate deeply into the lung's air sacs and their presence there can 'trigger a systemic inflammatory response that can be detected as high levels of a certain protein associated with an increase in heart attack risk', say researchers.\n\nThey have tracked pollution levels in the Boston region and interviewed 722 people about four days after they entered area hospitals with a heart attack in 1995 and 1996 for the study. They found that the patients experienced a 48 per cent rise in heart attack risk in the two hours after exposure to high levels of this type of invisible air pollutants. The patients experienced an increased risk even 24 hours after exposure. High amounts of fine particulate air pollution are present typically during very hot, hazy summer days, according to Mittleman."}

{"text":"Outdoor Air Pollution\n\nOn July 28, 2011, the EPA proposed a suite of standards to reduce air pollution from the oil and natural gas industry. These rules were the result of a lawsuit brought by Earthjustice on behalf of the WildEarth Guardians and the San Juan Citizens Alliance. As WildEarth Guardian's explained, in 2009, when the suit was filed:\n\nUnder the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to review and update clean air regulations every eight years. EPA .. failed to update two sets of clean air regulations it originally issued in 1985 and 1999, and ...failed altogether to issue a required third set of regulations. The result is a number of oil and gas operations and pollutants spewed by those operations are not limited in any way. Even oil and gas operations covered by the outdated regulations are not required to use the latest technologies to safeguard public health and the climate.\n\nOil and gas operations, including exploration, production and processing operations, consist of many pieces of equipment and practices that release air pollutants known to be harmful to public health and welfare. The impact on air quality includes emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxide, particulates and hazardous air pollutants.VOCs and nitrogen oxides mix with air and sunlight to produce ground-level ozone, which causes a variety of respiratory problems.While the emission of hazardous air pollutants is linked to elevated levels of cancer and neurological health issues.\n\nJeremy Nichols, Climate and Energy Program Director at WildEarth Guardians explained the highlights of the new fleet of proposed rule on his blog:\n\nThe proposed rules would generate a net savings of $30 million annually due to increased recovery of methane, otherwise known as natural gas. In other words, the rules would not only cost nothing to implement, but they would actually make money.\n\nThe proposed rules would reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by 540,000 tons, an industry-wide reduction of 25%. VOCs react with sunlight to form ground-level ozone, the key ingredient of smog and contain other toxic compounds.\n\nThe proposed rules would reduce methane emissions by 3.4 million tons, which is equal to 65 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, a reduction of about 26%. This will be like eliminating the carbon dioxide emissions of 15 coal-fired power plants. That is huge progress for the climate.\n\nThe proposed rules would reduce toxic air pollutants, such as benzene, a known carcinogen, by 38,000 tons, a 30% reduction.\n\nOil and gas operations in Pennsylvania and across the country continue to threaten public health and air quality and a lot of work remains. Jeremy Nichols explains some of the weaknesses of the proposed rules:\n\nThere are shortcomings. The rules do not explicitly regulate methane, a potent greenhouse gas. WildEarth Guardians and others estimated that a full suite of methane controls could save more than $1 billion annually. Still, even with the VOC controls, the rules would reduce methane emissions by more than 20% from the oil and gas sector, which itself is the largest source of methane in the United States. That's amazing news for the climate.\n\nAnd of course, let's be clear that cleaner natural gas is not the solution to our nation's energy needs. However, if we start to make progress toward exposing the clean air impacts of drilling and to at least hold industry accountable to protecting our health and well-being, we can make some major strides to ensure renewable energy and other cleaner sources of energy comes out ahead as the most desirable solution.\n\nCitizens can support the implementation of these rules and call for even stronger air quality regulations and protection by attending or speaking at the Oil and Natural Gas Air Pollution Standards Public Meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 27, 2011. The Public Meeting will be held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in Rooms 315\u2013316, located at 1000 Ft. Duquesne Blvd., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222; telephone: (412) 565\u20136000.

A promising recent development is a revamping of the city's public transportation system to include newer vehicles and stop older buses from circulating in the city center. In addition to auto exhaust, pollution from industrial facilities and burning garbage from the city dump combine to form a thick haze often hanging over the city.\n\nThe worst days occur when thermal inversions cause the haze to hang in a low-altitude pollution gulag, much like a pineapple-upside-down cake. Concentrations of particulates, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide often exceed World Health Organization safety standards, particularly on these days. During the rainy season, the haze is washed away by the afternoon rains, after which the atmosphere is amazingly free of pollutants.\n\nElsewhere, smoke and ash from occasional volcanic eruptions can make the atmosphere somewhat hazy, though the worst pollution comes from dry-season agricultural burning and forest fires. When one considers that more than half of all energy consumption comes from burning firewood, the reasons behind the thick haze hanging over much of the country during March and April begin to emerge"}
{"text":"Title\n\nAuthors\n\nPublication Date\n\n8-1-2003\n\nDegree Type\n\nMaster of Science\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is an increasing concern over mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. Coal-fired power generation accounts for approximately 33% of total mercury emission in the United States. Once it is emitted into the atmosphere and deposited on land or water, mercury can transform into methylmercury, an organic form. Mercury can then enter the food chain, which poses a potential threat to human health and the environment. To study the relationship between particulate bound mercury and fly ash properties, fly ash samples were collected from the mechanical hopper (MHP) and the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) of a 100 MWe pulverized coal-fired boiler and analyzed for particulate mercury concentration (Hgp), unburned carbon, loss on ignition (LOI), elemental content and specific surface area (SSA). Different types of software, such as Microsoft Excel, Minitab and Origin, were applied to build the regression models to evaluate the relationship between Hgp and fly ash properties. The results of the analysis indicate that the amount of mercury emissions is dependent on the properties of the fly ash at the MHP and ESP as well as the amount of fly ash removed by air pollution control devices (APCD). Their relationship can be described as: Hgp (MHP), ppm = 0.0230 + 0.00838 Carbon (MHP), % + 0.00385 LOI (MHP), % Hgp (ESP), ppm = -0.0180 + 0.0670 Carbon (ESP), % + 0.0448 LOI (ESP), % The SSA of ESP ash is larger than MHP ash, which can help explain why Hgp at the ESP is higher than at the MHP. For the multiple metal oxides in fly ash, all the regression results indicate the trace elements have a very weak relationship with Hgp. There is no significant effect from trace elements on mercury absorption. Further study of Hgp catalyst mechanism and absorption phenomenon is ongoing. The function of various emission control technologies such as SCR and hot-side ESP in some coal-fired power plants are being evaluated."}

{"text":"2007\n\nThomasville-- This week the utilities department is implementing one phase of a program that will take 4 to 6 years to complete. It will save the city money, and could save you from dangerous sewer gases.\n\nIt's a harmless, non-toxic smoke, but what it detects can be very harmful. The city is working with Custom Environmental, injecting the smoke into 200 manholes. Between each manhole runs 300 feet of pipe.\n\n\"If it has any defects in the pipes then the smoke will escape and that will indicate there's a problem with the sewer line,\" says Mike Atkinson, Director of Operations for the Gas, Water, & Sewer Department.\n\nWhat they're looking for is called inflow and infiltration, or I & I. \"That's where we get ground water running into the sewer lines and then that water through the sewer system is gravitated out to the waste water treatment plant,\" explains Atkinson.\n\nTreating that water runs up the cost of operating the treatment facility. Catching the defects now will save lots of money in the long run.\n\nBut its not just about money- there could be problems that could affect you, too. There is a chance you could see the smoke enter your home through your kitchen sink, or floor drains in your house, like the one in your bathtub. \"Basically that would be an indicator that your pipes coming to you from the street have a problem with you personal sewer lines,\" Atkinson says.\n\nIt something that's easily missed sometimes, but its important to get it checked out. \"Sewer gases could penetrate back into your home which could cause illness, up to and including even death,\" Atkinson warns.\n\nIf you do see smoke, don't panic. Call 911 or the utilities department to make sure its just smoke testing. Then, take care of the problem. Atkinson advises, \"you need to contact your local plumber to come out and check your lines out.\" The smoke could be the warning signal that saves your life.\n\nAfter each manhole in this phase of the program is tested, the city will go back to each one where there was a defect and repair it. They say when the 4 to 6 year project is complete, they'll have a much better hand on the condition of their system for future years."}

{"text":"Apr 16, 2012\n\nNew research from North Carolina State University shows that federal requirements governing diesel engines of new tractor trailer trucks have resulted in major cuts in emissions of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) \u2013 pollutants that have significant human health and environmental impacts.\n\n\"These requirements for new emission control technologies have increased costs for truck owners and operators, and we wanted to know whether there was any real benefit,\" says Dr. Chris Frey, professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State and co-author of a paper describing the research. \"We found that there is a huge reduction in both PM and NOx emissions.\"\n\nFrey and Ph.D. student Gurdas Sandhu used a portable emissions measurement system to sample exhaust from diesel trucks while the trucks were in use on roads and highways. The emission requirements apply to new trucks, meaning that trucks purchased in 2010 and trucks purchased in 1999 were subject to different emission requirements.\n\nFrey and Sandhu found that a truck in compliance with 1999 standards emitted 110 grams of NOx per gallon of fuel used, and 0.22 grams of PM per gallon of fuel used. NOx is a significant contributor to low-level ozone, which adversely impacts respiratory health. PM also adversely impacts respiratory health and, because it is largely made up of black carbon, also contributes to global climate change.\n\nTrucks in compliance with newer standards had far lower emissions. For example, a 2010 truck emitted 2 grams of NOx per gallon of fuel \u2013 a decrease of 98 percent. The PM emissions were 95 percent lower.\n\nThe NOx reductions stem from the implementation of exhaust gas recirculation and selective catalytic reduction technologies. The PM reductions are the result of installing diesel particulate filters into the tail pipes of diesel trucks.\n\n\"While these technologies are a significant investment for truck owners, this study shows that they are achieving a remarkable drop in emissions of contaminants that have meaningful health and environmental consequences,\" Frey says.\n\nThe paper, \"Real-World Measurement and Evaluation of Heavy Duty Truck Duty Cycles, Fuels, and Emission Control Technologies,\" is forthcoming from Transportation Research Record, the journal of the Transportation Research Board (TRB).

By 1964, most new cars sold in the U.S. were so equipped, and PCV quickly became standard equipment on all vehicles worldwide.\n\nAn exhaust system is usually tubing used to guide reaction exhaust gases away from a controlled combustion inside an engine or stove. The entire system conveys burnt gases from the engine and includes one or more exhaust pipes...\n\nemission standards were promulgated by the State of California for 1966 model year for cars sold in that state, followed by the United States as a whole in model year 1968. The standards were progressively tightened year by year, as mandated by the EPA.\n\nBy the 1974 model year, the emission standards had tightened such that the de-tuning techniques used to meet them were seriously reducing engine efficiency and thus increasing fuel usage. The new emission standards for 1975 model year, as well as the increase in fuel usage, forced the invention offor after-treatment of the exhaust gas. This was not possible with existing leaded because the lead residue contaminated the platinum catalyst.

The production and distribution of unleaded fuel was a major challenge, but it was completed successfully in time for the 1975 model year cars. All modern cars are now equipped with catalytic converters and leaded fuel is nearly impossible to buy in most First World countries.\n\nRegulatory agencies\n\nThe agencies charged with regulating exhaust emissions vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, even in the same country. For example, in the United States\n\nUnited States\n\nThe United States of America is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district...\n\n, overall responsibility belongs to the EPA, but due to special requirements of the State of California, emissions in California are regulated by theNorth America... U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is an agency of the federal government of the United States charged with protecting human health and the environment, by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress...\n\nTransport Canada is the department within the government of Canada which is responsible for developing regulations, policies and services of transportation in Canada. It is part of the Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities portfolio...\n\n- Canada (trains and ships)\n\nEuropehas control over regulation of emissions in EU member states; however, many member states have their own government bodies to enforce and implement these regulations in their respective countries. In short, the EU forms the policy (by setting limits such as the European emission standard) and the member states decide how to best implement it in their own country.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, matters concerning environmental policy are what is known as \"devolved powers\" which means, each of the constituent countries deals with it separately through their own government bodies set up to deal with environmental issues in their respective country: Department of the Environment is a devolved Northern Ireland government department in the Northern Ireland Executive. The minister with overall responsibility for the department is the Minister for the Environment.-Aim:...\n\n- Northern Ireland\n\nHowever, many UK-wide policies are handled by the Department of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and they are still subject to EU regulations.\n\nEmissions control\n\nFuel injection is a system for admitting fuel into an internal combustion engine. It has become the primary fuel delivery system used in automotive petrol engines, having almost completely replaced carburetors in the late 1980s....\n\nIn automotive electronics, electronic control unit is a generic term for any embedded system that controls one or more of the electrical systems or subsystems in a motor vehicle....\n\n.\n\nAdvances in engine and vehicle technology continually reduce the toxicity of exhaust leaving the engine, but these alone have generally been proved insufficient to meet emissions goals. Therefore, technologies to detoxify the exhaust are an essential part of emissions control.\n\nAir injection\n\nOne of the first-developed exhaust emission control systems is secondary air injection. Originally, this system was used to inject air into the engine's exhaust ports to provide oxygen so unburned and partially-burned hydrocarbons in the exhaust would finish burning. Air injection is now used to support's oxidation reaction, and to reduce emissions when an engine is started from cold. After a cold start, an engine needs a fuel-air mixture richer than what it needs atdoes not function efficiently until it has reached its own operating temperature. The air injected upstream of the converter supports combustion in the exhaust headpipe, which speeds catalyst warmup and reduces the amount of unburned hydrocarbon emitted from the tailpipe.\n\nAir Injection is a secondary technology, used in support of the main technologies on some engines.\n\nExhaust gas recirculation\n\nIn the United States and Canada, many engines in 1973 and newer vehicles (1972 and newer in California) have a system that routes a metered amount of exhaust into the intake tract under particular operating conditions. Exhaust neither burns nor supports combustion, so it dilutes the air\/fuel charge to reduce peak combustion chamber temperatures. This, in turn, reduces the formation of NOx\n\nNOx\n\nNOx is a generic term for the mono-nitrogen oxides NO and NO2 . They are produced from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen gases in the air during combustion, especially at high temperatures...\n\n.\n\nCatalytic converter\n\nThe catalytic converter is a device placed in the exhaust pipe, which converts hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and NOx into less harmful gases by using a combination of platinum, palladium and rhodium as catalysts.\n\nThere are two types of catalytic converter, a two-way and a three-way converter. Two-way converters were common until the 1980s, when three-way converters replaced them on most automobile engines. Seearticle for further details.\n\nEvaporative emissions control\n\nEvaporative emissions are the result of gasoline vapors escaping from the vehicle's fuel system. Since 1971, all U.S. vehicles have had fully sealed fuel systems that do not vent directly to the atmosphere; mandates for systems of this type appeared contemporaneously in other jurisdictions. In a typical system, vapors from the fuel tank and carburetor bowl vent (on carbureted vehicles) are ducted to canisters containing activated carbon\n\nActivated carbon. The vapors are adsorbed within the canister, and during certain engine operational modes fresh air is drawn through the canister, pulling the vapor into the engine,where it burns.\n\nEmission testing\n\nAn emission test cycle, also known as a 'smog check', is a specified procedure for measuring pollutant emissions of engines. For emission measurements to be comparable for different engines in a category, the measurements are performed under a specific operating pattern, or 'test cycle' of...\n\nwas enacted in the State of California measuring tailpipe emissions in PPM (parts per million).\n\nThe University of Denver is currently ranked 82nd among all public and private \"National Universities\" by U.S. News & World Report in the 2012 rankings....\n\n, which uses lasers to detect emissions while vehicles pass by on public roads, thus eliminating the need for owners to go to a test center. Stedman's laser detection of exhaust gases is commonly used in metropolitan areas.\n\nUse of emission test data\n\nEmission test results from individual vehicles are in many cases compiled to evaluate the emissions performance of various classes of vehicles, the efficacy of the testing program and of various other emission-related regulations (such as changes to fuel formulations) and to model the effects of auto emissions on public health and the environment. For example, the Environmental Working Group\n\nEnvironmental Working Group\n\nThe Environmental Working Group is an American environmental organization that specializes in research and advocacy in the areas of toxic chemicals, agricultural subsidies, public lands, and corporate accountability...\n\nused California ASM emissions data to create an \"Auto Asthma Index\" that rates vehicle models according to emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, chemical precursors to photochemical smog.\n\nSee also\n\nThe AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, was first published by the U.S. Public Health Service in 1968.

{"text":"rate this answer\n\nWednesday - September 14, 2005\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhat plant purifies the air?\n\nANSWER:\n\nThe short answer is every living plant purifies the air. All plants remove carbon dioxide from the air and use it in their metabolic processes. They also use oxygen, but actually produce more oxygen -- as a by-product of photosynthesis -- than they consume.\n\nIn a now-famous series of experiments, Dr. Bill Wolverton, a NASA scientist, showed the effectiveness of several species of commonly grown indoor (mostly tropical) plants in removing volatile organic compounds, VOC's, from the air.\n\nMany people believe indoor plants are very effective at reducing illness cause by breathing VOC's in the home and office. The illness is often referred to as \"Sick Building Syndrome.\" It is likely that many plants that are not used indoors are just as effective at removing VOC's and other air impurities from the air outdoors.\n\nHere is a list of plants shown to be effective in removing VOC's from indoor air included in a very nice article on the subject.\n\nMore General Botany"}

{"text":"Interior Environment - it's a term you're going to hear more about in the near future, and the future is today at OWC! There are several aspects to interior zoning for optimal environmental control. Let's look at some of them and see how they work together. Interior environment consists of several elements. Among them are air quality, temperature, humidity, environmental toxins and lighting. Promoting a Green interior environment also means setting the standards high and starting from there!\n\nAir Quality\nAir quality is a combination of factors: dust control; removing the bacteria and mold that are common to HVAC systems; and optimizing CO2 mixtures as well as temperature. How do you achieve this balance within a large building with multiple offices and large rooms?\n\nThe answer is Zoning. Zoning consists of sensors which monitor various aspects of space environmental quality. Let's look at an office to demonstrate how these controls work.\nCO2 and Temperature\nIn each interior space, a sensor will monitor two primary elements: Carbon Dioxide, and room temperature. While both criteria can often be met as a combination, with seasonal change, monitoring them individually provides a much greater degree of energy efficiency and control.\n\nCarbon Dioxide levels in a room are quite low when there is a single occupant. However, as the number of people in the room increases, CO2 levels will rise accordingly, from people's intake of oxygen, and exhaling carbon dioxide.\n\nHigh CO2 levels within the work environment have been shown to have negative effects on room comfort and personal productivity. In this instance, when the exhaled CO2 from multiple occupants causes the CO2 level to rise beyond a pre-set level, the sensor notes this, and causes heating\/cooling vents into the room to open, permitting more fresh air into the room. When sensor sampling of the air indicates that there are less people in the room, the \"zone\" is activated to reflect that fact, and the vents will automatically redirect air into other parts of the building.\n\nAll of this is automatic without any user input, unless the user requests a comfort level different (warmer or cooler) than those of the primary settings for the building. Rather than change parameters for the entire building, this zone adjustment can be customized for an individual's preferences within their personal zone.\n\nEnvironmental Toxins\nAddressing air quality is accomplished both by filtering out existing toxins and reducing the buildup of bacteria and molds that can enter the air circulation system.\n\nMicron Air Filters\nThe first stage of cleaning air entering the HVAC system is always a good quality air filter. Just like at home, a good quality air filter can capture up to 99.9% of dust, molds, pollen and other pollutants in the air before it is ever passed into the first stage of the system. Like so many things, the very backbone of a system turns out to be one of the most inexpensive parts of the system! A good filter eliminates most of the contaminants, and those\nthat do pass through, have to face the......\n\nUltra-Violet Light\nThe heat exchange coil on the inside of the building is virtually identical to the one in every home. Here you will find water condensation and\nas a result, a breeding ground for various entities, from viral, to bacteria and molds, all of which like damp, dark areas to grow.\n\nMaking the coil a place where these \"critters\" won't want to make their home can be done with just a pair of light bulbs!. Ultra-violet light, to be specific. A small bulb, looking like a fluorescent tube, ranging from two to four feet in length, will sit on each side of the heat exchange coil. Like those used in water purification, as the air passes near the bulb, the wavelength of ultra-violet light will kill mold, viruses and bacteria before they can make their home in the coil. The ultra-voilet light is always shining on the coil too, and as air that has been filtered by a super high quality micron air filter enters the chamber, the UV light cleans of its \"live\" cargo before it is passed through the vents and the work areas."}
{"text":"Specify VOC emissions, not just VOC content\n\nAs a decorating choice, paints and coatings remain as popular as ever, with specifiers and consumers also showing strong interest in using green products.\n\nAs a decorating choice, paints and coatings remain as popular as ever, with specifiers and consumers also showing strong interest in using green products.\n\nAn important consideration when selecting green products - and a point of some confusion in the marketplace - is what criteria to use to evaluate which paints do the best job of minimizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor air.\n\nHistorically, the focus has been on the contribution of VOCs to outdoor air pollution, in particular ozone and smog formation. To reduce the impact of paint and coating VOCs on the outdoor environment, federal and state regulations set limits in terms of VOC content, usually expressed as grams per liter minus water. As a result, paint and coating manufacturers have complied with these regulations by reducing the amount of VOC content in their products.\n\nHowever, relying strictly on content verification can be misleading, since it does not give a clear picture of how much of a particular VOC or the total amount of VOCs from paint may be getting into indoor air. Nor does it give an accurate picture of how the VOC emissions from a product will affect the total VOCs in the area where paint is being applied.\n\nFor example, results of air sampling studies have shown when paint is drying, indoor VOC levels can be 1,000 times higher than in outdoor air. Some VOCs can cross contaminate other indoor materials and then continue to outgas for an extended time.\n\nLimiting exposure to VOC emissions is important in protecting public health. VOC exposure has been linked to respiratory illnesses, such as allergies and asthma, memory impairment, headaches, reproductive and developmental problems, sensory irritation, immunosuppression and cancer. Keep in mind that health impact may be dependent on specific VOCs, levels of VOCs and potential mixtures of VOCs.\n\nAnother point of confusion is paint and coating products marketed as having low or no VOCs can still emit significant amounts of VOCs into the indoor air. The results of a comparative study of VOC content\/emissions, conducted by Air Quality Sciences , illustrates this important point ( see table ) and underscores that the only accurate way to ensure a healthy indoor environment is to measure VOC emissions from the products themselves.\n\nIn recognition of the health risks associated with VOC emissions, the Collaborative for High Performance Schools green construction program defines acceptable indoor air quality performance based on a product's emissions levels. In addition, US Green Building Council's LEED for Schools has strengthened its criteria to encourage the use of low-emitting products, including paints and coatings.\n\nTo meet regulatory and market demands and to reduce product liability risks, paint and coating manufacturers will increasingly need to demonstrate their technology leadership by testing and monitoring VOC emissions to ensure their products emit low levels of VOCs and potentially reformulate those products that do not comply with emission limits.\n\nThe most reliable and scientifically proven way to test for VOC emissions is by using environmental chamber technology. This method allows a product to produce emissions similar to the way the product would perform in a home, office or school. The collected data is then mathematically modeled to determine exposure concentrations produced by product application in many different indoor environments.\n\nThose who embrace a strategy of VOC emissions testing, along with responsibly using products that are certified as low emitting (not just low VOC content), will realize major benefits, including:\n\nReceiving fewer product-related odor and irritation complaints from building occupants\n\nAs the pioneer of environmental chamber technology and key partner in the development of ASTM testing protocols for product emissions using ECT, AQS is ready to partner with the paints and coating industry to create and maintain healthy indoor environments by offering the most complete and most sensitive testing of paint and coating products. AQS also employs experts who can help manufacturers modify their product formulations to be the best performers and the best at protecting the indoor environment and building occupants.

{"text":"Air Pollution Control\n\n1. Acid Gas Pollution Control Program\nAcid Gas Pollution Control Program is officially called the Acid Rain Program. The Acid Rain Program is run by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The program is run as a market-based operation and works in an effort to reduce pollution levels in relations to the atmospheric levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which cause acid rain. This is an important issue because this causes pollution in plants that lead to the destruction of aquatic animals, as well. What this program does is allow corporations to gain economic incentives if they reduce the pollution that they exert.\n\n2. Mercury Pollution Control\nOne of the most frequently used of the mercury pollution control devices to fight of the harmful pollution that mercury gives off is the venturi scrubber. The venturi scrubber is designed to allow the energy usage from the inlet gas stream to ensure that the liquid being used to scrub the gas stream is done in an effective manner. This pollution control device allows this to happen in a way so that the mercury pollution that is bound to occur otherwise is cut out or minimized.\n\n3. LO NOx Pollution Control\nThe pollution control device that is used to minimize the NOx pollution is a LO NOx burner. It is used to decrease the level of steam that is input into the air. If a large amount of steam is projected into the air, this can lead to quite damaging air pollution. The LO NOx burner is typically a component found in most utility boilers.\n\n4. Dust Collection Pollution Control\nThe dust collection pollution control is used in an effort to eliminate dust pollution. Contrary to common disbelief, dust pollution can be quite harmful if you were to breathe in large quantities. Dust collection systems work as large vacuums and work to decrease the amount of dust that is floating in the air. For your living spaces, and small office spaces, you are usually able to dust manually by using a feather duster. Nevertheless, for those that live and work in large buildings, there is usually a dust collection pollution control system that is installed. One of the places that have to utilize this system for the safety of company employees are commercial woodworking shops. There is a vast number of wood dust, chips, and shavings that are released in the air that they must be protected from."}

{"text":"Better indoor air starts with minerals\n\nJan 05, 2011\n\nThe structural model of a mineral with the dispersed pollutant molecule. When it is introduced into particleboards, the mineral reduces formaldehyde emissions from the wood material. Credit: Fraunhofer ISCSince the 50s, formaldehyde has been the basic material for many artificial resins and glues used in particleboards and plywood boards. Estimates indicate that more than 85 percent of all wood materials have adhesives containing formaldehyde. This substance escapes from the materials and, along with other sources, pollutes indoor air. This is why numerous ways have been developed to reduce emissions, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization WHO has even classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic for humans. Thereupon both the existing threshold value of 0.1 ppm issued by Germany's then-Federal Health Office in 1977 and WHO's standard value of 100 micrograms per cubic meter have been confirmed.\n\nResearchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wood Research, Wilhelm-Klauditz-Institut WKI in Braunschweig, Germany, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, have found a new method to reduce formaldehyde emissions from particleboard: modified zeolites. These are aluminosilicates that function as a molecular sieve due to their extremely large inner surface and porous structure so that they can absorb formaldehyde particularly well. Dr. Katrin Bokelmann ought to know because she is the project manager at the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research who, along with her team, is in charge of manufacturing mineral compounds. As she puts it: \"Zeolites are already used as a filling material in particleboards, but it's an entirely new idea to use them for adsorbing pollutants in wood materials.\"\n\nThe researchers were not able to achieve sufficiently high rates of adsorption in their tests of various commercially available or natural minerals. The best adsorption properties of these aluminosilicates were measured in synthetic zeolite Y, which the experts modified and improved with amino groups. Dr. Jan Gunschera is the project manager at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wood Research and this is how he sees it: \"We noticed a 70 percent boost in the adsorption rate after we added formaldehyde to the processed material in our measuring chambers and then we put five percent by weight of the zeolite powder directly into our sample particleboards made of spruce roundwood. The result was that formaldehyde emissions from the board dropped 40 percent \u2013 both short-term and long-term tests of one month confirm these findings. In other words, the air in living spaces should be measurably improved. Our tests indicate that this technology can even reduce indoor air pollutant levels.\" The properties of the wood materials did not undergo any negative influence from the zeolites, it was reported.\n\nThe researchers have applied for a patent for the new technique and think that modified zeolites \u2013 worked into furniture or ceiling panels \u2013 could conceivably reduce not only formaldehyde but also other aldehyde levels in indoor air. Scientists are currently looking for partners from the wood materials industry to mass-produce particleboards. A sample panel is on display at the Bau fair in Munich, Germany, from January 17 to 22 at Fraunhofer's joint stand.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nIn a real-life \"back to the future\" story, scientists today reported that the sustainable, environmentally-friendly process that gave birth to plywood a century ago is re-emerging as a \"green\" alternativeThe formaldehyde added to fabrics to keep clothing looking fresh and wrinkle-free is unlikely to pose a health risk to consumers, according to an article in the current issue of Chemical & Engineering News (C&EN), ACS' weekly ...\n\nPreliminary results show that a common environmental chemical may increase the risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, according to research that will be presented at ...\n\nMore than two million Chinese youths die each year from health problems related to indoor air pollution, with nearly half of them under five years of age, state media cited a government study as saying.\n\nAs a frequent addition to the list of America's most polluted cities, Houston is no stranger to having more than just oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air.

{"text":"Science News\n\nBeijing Game For Clean Air Challenge\n\nMay 13, 2008 \u2014 With the Olympic Games in sight, the Chinese Government is committed to improving the air quality in Beijing, and has had measures in place since 1998 which have already made a difference. However, there is still some way to go to meet national air quality standards in the Chinese capital, according to Professor Wang Wen-Xing and his team from the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences in Beijing, in the People's Republic of China.\n\nShare This:\n\nSince the 1980s, the rapid industrial development, urbanization and increase in traffic have resulted in severe air pollution in Beijing. And with the Olympic Games around the corner, international attention has focused on the quality of the air in the capital.\n\nWen-Xing and colleagues measured the concentrations of well-known air pollutants in Beijing in August and September 2007, the same summer period the Olympic Games will be taking place this year, in order to get a picture of the likely air quality during the Games. They compared their results against The National Ambient Air Quality Standard. The purpose of their study was to inform measures to improve the air quality of the capital, in anticipation of the Olympic Games.\n\nThe researchers found that average daily concentrations of sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide were lower than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for China. Nitrogen dioxide levels met the Standard, whereas concentrations of ozone and inhalable particles were higher than the Standard. The concentrations of air pollutants were also higher at night than during the day. According to the authors, the main causes of this air pollution are vehicle emissions \u2013 in recent years, the number of cars in Beijing has increased sharply at a rate of 10-20% a year - and weather conditions, particularly dry air and lack of rain which hinder the diffusion and deposition of pollutants.\n\nA series of measures such as reducing vehicle emissions, encouraging the use of public transport, eliminating polluting factories, and improving fuel quality have been in place since 1998 to reduce the emissions and concentrations of air pollutants in Beijing. These measures have already significantly reduced air pollution in the Chinese capital.\n\nHowever, in comparison to other Olympic sites around the world, including Helsinki and Los Angeles, \"Beijing's air quality needs to improve\" says Wen-Xing. He concludes that the Chinese Government is committed to reducing the air pollution in Beijing further, for cleaner air in time for the Games this summer.\n\nOlympic Games: Air Quality Forecasts For China(July 24, 2008) \u2014 With less than a month remaining before the Beijing Olympics, Chinese officials have introduced a series of measures to improve air quality for the Games.

{"text":"A Month in Monitoring\n\nDeploying the time and cost intensive techniques of aerosol measurement, this article looks to quantify sources contributing to airborne pollution at the Port Talbot steel works.\n\nAerosols, otherwise known as particulate matter (PM) are solid or liquid droplets suspended in the air. These particles are products of direct biogenic and anthropogenic activities, and may also be formed indirectly via chemical processes, as in secondary aerosols.\nDirectly-emitted particles (primary aerosols) come from natural processes such as sea spray, volcanic eruption, windblown dusts, crustal matter erosion, forest fires or vegetation detritus, as well as human activities that emit PM into the atmosphere which include traffic, industry, agriculture, mining, coal and biomass combustion, and incineration.\n\nSecondary particle formation involves chemical conversion of gases generated biogenically or anthropogenically into a particulate product. Examples of secondary aerosol are sulphate and nitrates, which are formed by oxidation of nitrogen (IV) and sulphur (IV) oxides respectively.\n\nAerosol nomenclature derives from their size distribution. Particles may occur in three modes viz: ultrafine (aerodynamic diameter < 0.1 \u00b5m), fine (aerodynamic diameter, < 2.5 \u00b5m) and coarse (aerodynamic diameter, 2.5- 10 \u00b5m). Ultrafine and fine aerosols are usually formed by high temperature processes, often from human activities, while coarse particles are sourced mainly but not solely from natural processes.\n\nAerosols have direct and indirect impacts on human lives and are therefore worthy of study. They have a direct influence on the quality of life causing morbidity and mortality. A report from the UK Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants estimated that nearly 29,000 deaths annually in the UK are associated with anthropogenic particulate matter pollution.\n\nToxicity of aerosols depends on many factors such as the particle's size, number, mass, chemical composition and concentration. Their indirect impact on the quality of life includes the reduction of visibility through smog formation, and their influence upon climate change.\n\nThe understanding of aerosol properties is critically dependent upon available instruments for their study. Different instruments have evolved for researching aerosol properties and behaviour ranging from offline to online instruments.\n\nOur major objective in the Port Talbot air sampling campaign was to deploy different online and offline instruments for four weeks in order to monitor air quality and to quantify sources contributing to airborne concentrations.\n\nPort Talbot is an example of a major industrial setting in the United Kingdom. The main industry is the steel complex located on a south-west to north-west axis of the town. The activities of the steel works have been a major contributor to particulate matter pollution in the area.\n\nAerosol measurement techniques\n\nThe two approaches employed for monitoring airborne particulate matter in our sampling campaign at Port Talbot were offline and online methods. Offline methods involve collecting the airborne particulate matter onto a substrate such as a filter paper. The filters would have been pre-weighed before sampling, and after sampling weighed again in order to calculate the gravimetric mass concentration of aerosol.\n\nThe chemical composition of the aerosol is obtainable through laboratory analyses. Aerosol may be analysed for organic (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hopanes, alcohols, organic acids or levoglucan) and inorganic (metals, water soluble ions, carbonaceous species) constituents depending upon the research objectives. The second approach is online measurement involving real time data collection. Online aerosol measurement is a high time resolution technique of analysis for obtaining information on particle mass\/chemical composition, size and number\/count.\n\nOffline measurement techniques\n\nOne offline sampler deployed in the Port Talbot air monitoring campaign measured particle size distribution. We used a cascade impactor which has been applied for environmental pollution and visibility studies.\n\nThe particular model used had cut points including 10, 5.6, 3.2, 1.8, 1.0, 0.56, 0.32 and 0.18 \u00b5m. A flow of air (30 L\/min) enters through the inlet and PM size fractions are collected by impaction on the 47 mm Teflon filter substrates. The last stage in the system collects the smallest size fraction of aerosol through filtration on a 37 mm- quartz fibre filter. The rotating ability of the instrument allows for uniform deposition of aerosol on the filter substrates.\n\nDichotomous air sampler\n\nThis is a sequential air sampler that measures two PM fractions; namely fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) particles simultaneously on 47 mm filter substrates. It is a programmable sampler that can sample PM continuously for 16 days.\n\nThere are two magazines (one for fine and the other for coarse) made up of 16 filter cassettes for sample collection and also two magazines for collection of exposed filters. Another feature of this sampler is incorporation of meteorological data collection. The air flow of 16.1 L\/min (PM10) passes through the inlet and is split into two fractions -15.0 L\/min (PM2.5) and 1.7 L\/min (PM2.5-10) by a virtual impactor. The coarse particle stream contains a small contribution of fine particles, for which a correction is applied.\n\nHigh volume sampler\n\nA high volume aerosol sampler can be loaded with 15 filter holders equipped with 150 mm quartz fibre filters. The one we used is different from the conventional high volume sampler, because it is programmable, and also equipped with meteorological measurement features. This sampler has similar features to a the dichotomous sampler, except that it samples only one PM fraction at a time. The air flow for the instrument is 100-1000 L\/min.\n\nStreaker sampler\n\nA streaker is an air sampler that collects time and size-resolved samples. It samples on 82 mm filters (comprised of Nuclepore and Kapton) in a 180o pattern for 168 hours (seven days). The Nuclepore substrate collects the fine PM by filtration while the Kapton samples the coarse PM fraction by impaction.\n\nA 1 L\/min flow of air passes through the inlet of the sampler through a non-rotating and subsequently a rotating impactor where two PM size ranges are collected. The filters are analysed offline for metals with ion beam analysis by Proton Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE). D'Alessandro et al (2003) reported a study of hourly analysis of elemental composition of urban aerosol in four towns in Italy with a streaker sampler. The sampler inlet we used was placed on the roof of our mobile laboratory.\n\nOffline sampling is unable to differentiate aerosol internal and external mixing (e.g. internally mixed particles each contain a mixture of constituents while in externally mixed particles, each particle contains a specific compound or component, but there are many different types), and can suffer from loss of materials during sampling, transportation and analysis.\n\nOnline sampling can overcome these problems and allows higher time resolution. PM mass, chemical composition, size distribution and numbers can be determined in real time depending on the instrument's response time.\n\nThe ATOFMS is a single particle mass spectrometer designed for in-situ characterisation of the sizes and chemical composition of individual aerosol particles in real time drawn in at an air flow 0.9 L min-1. The system comprises three distinct regions: (i) an aerosol introduction interface; (ii) a light scattering region where particle and velocity\/size are determined; and (iii) two reflectron-time-of-flight mass spectrometers for analysis of positive and negative ions.\nThe air enters through an aerodynamic lens which creates a beam of particles which are individually sized by measuring their time-of-flight between two low-powered (Nd:YAG) lasers. Each particle is then vaporised and ionised by a high powered laser, and composition is estimated from the mass spectral data collected.\n\nPortable aerosol spectrometer\n\nThis is an online instrument that provides information on size-resolved particle numbers and mass concentrations in a real time using a light beam produced by a laser diode, but no chemical data. The unit we used classifies particles into 15 size bins as they enter the inlet mounted on top of our mobile laboratory. The instrument is connected to a computer where the output is displayed.\n\nChemical analyses\n\nAerosol measurement is both time and cost intensive, especially for offline sampling techniques. After field sampling, the filters on which aerosols are collected are transferred to the laboratory for assays. The chemical analyses applied to the samples include:\n\u2022 Ion chromatography for water soluble ions (sulphate, nitrate, chloride, phosphate, oxalate, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium)\n\u2022 Spectrometry (Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) for analysis of metals\n\u2022 Proton Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE) for metals\/elements in samples collected by the Streaker sampler\n\u2022 Thermal\/optical transmission analysis for carbonaceous species (organic and elemental carbon)\n\u2022 Gas Chromatography\/Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) for organic constituent analysis\nFor this project, the main areas of interest are analysis of water soluble ions and metals in the exposed filters.\n\nResults\n\nPreliminary data for air quality parameters from the AURN site, Port Talbot (uk-air.defra.gov.uk\/data\/data_selector?q=73274#mid) are presented in Figure 1. The hourly concentrations of air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, CO, NOx, O3) show wide variations.\n\nThe 24 hour average of 50 \u00b5g\/m3 for PM10 was not exceeded except for two episode days where PM10 concentrations of 79 and 52 \u00b5g\/m3 were observed. The mean concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 during the one month sampling were 22.16\u00b114.85 \u00b5g\/m3 and 11.35\u00b14.32 \u00b5g\/m3, respectively.\n\nThe PM2.5\/PM10 ratio for the one month sampling period is 0.51, indicating almost equal contributions of fine and coarse particles. This is a low PM2.5\/PM10 ratio reflecting the contributions of marine particles at this coastal site and dust from the industrial site to coarse particle concentrations. In the traffic polluted environment of Marylebone Road, a PM2.5\/PM10 ratio of 0.67 has been reported.\n\nAnother observation from Figures 1 and 2 is the higher peaks of air pollution parameters shown in week two and week four. The trend is spread across the time series plots for all the pollutants except for ozone, for which maritime air is the main source.\n\nParticulate and gaseous pollutants show higher concentrations towards the southwesterly sector where the steelworks complex is located (Figure 2a-f). SO2, CO and NOx are products of fuel combustion. Elevated concentrations of particulate pollutants observed at the AURN site in this sector serve to confirm the industrial contribution.\n\nCharron and Harrison (2005) have shown during periods of high wind speed, there is a possibility of dilution of PM2.5 as well as resuspension of coarse particles. Consequently, as a result of a high wind speed, the ratio of PM2.5\/PM10 is altered.\n\nThe report of AQEG (2005) indicated that PM2.5 in Port Talbot is dominated primarily by long range transportation from the east. This is clearly shown in the PM2.5 pollution rose in which apart from the industry contribution, another emission source from the easterly wind sector is clear. PM2.5 in the UK has been reported to be dominated by secondary aerosol.\n\nThere are other possible emission sources of pollutants affecting the AURN site apart from the steel industry, as seen in the pollution roses for PM2.5, NOx and ozone. Traffic remains a significant factor for NOx and PM2.5 emissions. Concentrations of ozone did not exceed the 100 ppb of eight hour maximum daily exposure given by WHO (2006), despite the fact that there were instances of hourly exceedences. Ground-level ozone at higher concentration has direct and indirect detrimental effects on public health.\n\nSource apportionment\n\nFurther laboratory analyses of offline filter samples is ongoing. All of the data will be used in a receptor modelling study designed to quantify the contributions of the various source categories to measured pollutant concentrations (referred to as source apportionment).\n\nExamples of source apportionment models that have been used for source identification and apportionment are: Chemical Mass Balance (CMB), multivariate techniques such as Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Pragmatic Mass Closure.\n\nPossible sources that could have contributed to high PM concentrations in Port Talbot include the Irish Sea, steel industry, traffic, railway and crustal materials. It is therefore of importance to screen the air pollution data through a receptor model to infer the contributions by each of these factors mentioned. In this case, it is planned to use the PMF model, developed by Paatero and Tapper (1994).\n\nAuthor\n\nProfessor Roy M Harrison, Adewale M Taiwo, Dr David CS Beddows\n\nDr David Beddows is a Research Fellow and Staff Scientist of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, based at the University of Birmingham.

A new report by the National Parks Conservation Association shows ozone pollution levels exceeded health-based standards more than 200 times at 18 of the national parks with ozone monitors. That's the highest level in three years and resulted in several 'Code Red' days when even healthy people are advised to avoid vigorous outdoor exercise.\n\nThe Air Resources Division of the National Park Service has air monitoring systems set up in about 70 national parks around the country.

{"text":"share this story\n\n\"Children,\" offered Desmond Tutu, \"have an extraordinary capacity to see into the heart of things.\" That wisdom is the foundation for our annual survey of children around the world. The third annual Small Voices, Big Dreams survey polled more than 6,200 10-to-12-year-olds from 47 different countries on six continents. As before, their perspectives on the world around them are an unvarnished lesson told in truths, and we can learn much from them.\n\nThe 2012 survey amplified what we had heard in previous years -- that children value, first and foremost, their education and that they have high hopes for themselves, despite daily hardships. Within the findings, they also reminded us of their biggest fears: animals.\n\nThis past year, we included an additional focus, soliciting children's insights on the environment. We learned, for example, that 40 percent of children in developing countries had experienced a drought first-hand. One-third (33 percent) had been through floods and almost as many (30 percent) a bush or forest fire. And yet, despite these personal experiences with devastating natural disasters, when asked what environmental problem they worry about most, the top answer -- cited by 26 percent -- was pollution.\n\nAt first, the answer may seem counterintuitive. After all, children in developing countries -- countries that are largely agrarian -- are rarely exposed to the kinds of pollution that we more typically associate with more urban, developed nations. But the fact is, many children in poorer countries contend with a sinister form of indoor air pollution that not only affects their health but poses other deadly risks. It's the pollution caused by indoor cooking.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, some 3 billion people in developing countries cook meals inside their homes over open fires or leaky stoves. The resulting smoke creates indoor air pollution that can be 100 times higher than acceptable levels and contributes to the premature death of an estimated 2 million annually. The impact is especially severe for children, whose exposure in particularly high, given the amount of time they spend indoors. Indoor air pollution causes almost half of the deaths of children under five who die from respiratory infections.\n\nWhen children point to pollution as of paramount concern, it's an answer that they come by honestly. What many of them are not yet aware of is that solutions are already underway. On a recent trip to Uganda, I met teenagers in one village whom ChildFund had taught to build stoves made of mud bricks. Selling the stoves not only provided a steady source of income -- this one group of teenagers had sold more than 100 of them -- but they also provided a more environmentally friendly and healthy alternative to open-flame cooking. And the mud stoves, which used a metal cylinder for venting the smoke outside the home, used far less firewood than other cooking methods.\n\nWhile the children surveyed named pollution of their top environmental concern, a close second was the threat of natural disasters. Drought and floods, fires and earthquakes can take a devastating toll on people who are already struggling to get through the week ahead, and worrying about such catastrophes is only natural. They have witnessed firsthand how natural disasters can wipe out years of progress. As we watch our fellow citizens in New York and New Jersey struggle to regain their footing in the wake of super storm Sandy, imagine them doing so without government assistance, without insurance companies, without the safety nets that we Americans can rely on in times like these. In developing countries, recovering from a natural disaster literally can mean starting over.\n\nChildren in developing countries have an innate sensibility when it comes to environmental stewardship. They have been the victims of mudslides caused by the denuding of trees and vegetation needed to stabilize the landscape. They daily tote clean drinking water for miles for their family to cook with and drink. They regularly inhale dangerous soot particles from indoor air pollution. They understand, perhaps even more profoundly than their parents, that there must not be a choice between survival and stewardship. We can and must opt for both.\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\n\"There isn't enough land to feed the nine billion people\" is one tired argument that gets trotted out by the anti-organic crowd, including Kopperud.\n\nThat assertion ignores a 2007 study led by Ivette Perfecto, of the University of Michigan, showing that in developing countries, where the chances of famine are greatest, organic methods could double or triple crop yields.\n\n\"My hope is that we can finally put a nail in the coffin of the idea that you can't produce enough food through organic agriculture,\" Perfecto told Science Daily at the time.\n\nRodale concludes that farming must move away from using unsustainable, increasingly unaffordable, petroleum-based fertilizers and pesticides and turn to \"organic, regenerative farming systems that sustain and improve the health of the world population, our soil, and our environment.\" The science the report so amply cites shows that such a system would\n\ngive competitive yields to \"conventional\" methods\nimprove soil and boost its capacity to hold water, particularly important during droughts\nsave farmers money on pesticides and fertilizers\nsave energy because organic production requires 20 to 50 percent less input\nmitigate global warming because cover crops and compost can sequester close to 40 percent of global CO2 emissions\nincrease food nutrient density"}

{"text":"effects of second-hand smoke can be contradictory when it comes to lung function between boys and girls.\n\nThere is one thing that is certain; it's extremely harmful to both genders.\n\nWhen it comes to allergies and lung function, the latest study suggests a drastic difference between boys and girls. At the University of Cincinnati, doctors and researchers with the Department of Environmental Health have spent the last eight years trying to find an answer to that question.\n\nKelly Brunst joined the project as a Ph. D student within the college of medicine and says the results were a little surprising.\n\n\"Nearly 80% of the children in our area have detectable levels of environmental tobacco smoke in their hair,\" said Brunst.\n\nThe study is officially called the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study or CCAAPS study. The group tested 486 children over the course of eight years. The children were targeted before birth based on their parents who tested positive for allergies and symptoms.\n\n\"These children are a group of kids that are at risk for developing allergies and asthma later in life,\" said Brunst.\n\nThe children were tested every year, from age one through four, and then again at age seven. The tests included; a skin prick test for allergies along with pulmonary function and asthma, plus hair continue examinations for second-hand smoke. At age seven more extensive testing included pulmonary function testing.\n\nJames Lockey a professor with UC's department of environmental health says both genders did show symptoms of decreased lung function and allergies by age seven after being exposed to second hand smoke.\n\nThe allergens that were most prevalent were pollen, ragweed and dust mites. However, girls showed heightened results at age two for allergies and at age seven showed an alarming difference in lung function.\n\n\"Girls who were allegorically sensitized had six times the decrease in lung function compared to boys,\" said Brunst.\n\nIn this study 16% of the children tested reported one parent in the house as a smoker and 6% reported two parents as smokers. However, cigarette smoke isn't the only factor in this study, mobile emissions are a problem too.\n\n\"We noticed how many trucks were on the super highways,\" said Lockey. \"That's really where the study started.\"\n\nThe majority of the pollutants in the air come from benzene, a carcinogen found in car emissions.\n\n\"Cars and trucks, those are basic mobile sources and they contribute about 90% over 90% of the carbon monoxide we see in this area,\" said Brad Miller of the Hamilton County Environmental Services Department. \"\n\nRight now, it's about limiting exposure and changing bad habits.

{"text":"Radical proposal for atmospheric link to asthma\n\n09 April 2008\n\nAustralian researchers have discovered that nitrate radicals irreversibly damage amino acids. This raises the possibility that the radicals play a role in respiratory disease, they claim.\n\nNitrogen dioxide and ozone have been linked to airway diseases such as asthma, although their exact role is not clear. In the atmosphere, these gases can react to form extremely reactive nitrate radicals, leading Uta Wille and Duanne Sigmund at the University of Melbourne, Victoria, to question whether there is a link between these radicals and respiratory disease.\n\n\"The duo has found that nitrate radicals irreversibly damage aromatic amino acids\"\n\nAs part of their research, the duo has found that nitrate radicals irreversibly damage aromatic amino acids, forming compounds including -nitrate esters, -carbonyl and aromatic nitro-compounds. 'The reaction forms oxidised products,' explains Wille, 'some of which have been found in polluted air and are associated with immune stimulation.' By analysing these products the researchers proposed a mechanism for the oxidation and nitration reactions.\n\nNitrate radicals will react with aromatic amino acids. The radicals can form in the atmosphere from nitrogen dioxide and ozone\n\n'The next step is to study the radicals' role in damage to proteins, peptides and carbohydrates - molecules that line the cells of the respiratory tract and so are in direct contact with the atmosphere,' says Wille. Ultimately the team wants to check whether the radicals can migrate through the cell membrane, 'where they could cause damage inside the cell,' Wille adds.\n\nMalcolm Forbes, an expert in free radical chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, US, welcomes the research, and says: 'The results will have a significant impact on research into oxidative damage to proteins, particularly in regard to respiratory illness. The challenge now is to correlate these results with in vivo studies to assess the real impact to society.'"}
{"text":"Indicator 6 3 : Urban air pollution\n\nGoal: Minnesotans will improve the quality of the air, water and earth. Continuously improving the health of Minnesota's natural systems not only ensures continued access to the raw materials that fuel Minnesota's economy, but also protects the irreplaceable roles of healthy natural systems, such as flood and pest control, moderation of the climate and pollination of crops.\n\nRationale: Air pollution in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, Minnesota's most urbanized region, is one indicator of the state's air quality.\n\nAbout this indicator: The Twin Cities area has seen dramatic improvement in the number of days above \"moderate\" levels for six monitored air pollutants. From 1990 to 2000, the frequency dropped from 205 days to 38 days, an 82 percent reduction. The six pollutants are carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, lead and dust. This indicator is based on the Air Pollutant Standards Index developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide a simple, uniform way to report daily air pollution concentrations. It does not measure whether certain combinations of pollutants occur.\n\nA downward trend in the six criteria pollutants suggests that regulation and pollution prevention efforts, including reduced emissions in newer cars, have produced significant gains in urban air quality, even while the state's economy and population have grown. Minnesota's vehicle emissions testing program, which ended in 1999, may also have contributed to the emissions reductions.\n\nFor comparison: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency collects national air quality data but uses a different method, making comparisons difficult. Air quality in the Twin Cities region is better than in many other urban areas in the United States. Minnesota's relatively flat terrain and exposure to rapidly moving weather systems allows wind to disperse and carry away air pollution. Also, industry is less concentrated here than in some U.S. cities.\n\nThings to think about: Weather patterns can cause large variations in pollution levels in a single year. For example, hot, dry weather increased the levels of dust and ozone in 1994.\n\nHundreds of airborne chemicals remain unregulated, including most toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.\n\nTechnical notes: This indicator is based on data collected Monday through Friday in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. A moderate level of pollution is reported if any one of the six criteria pollutants exceeds half the federal standard. The data does not differentiate days when more than one pollutant reaches moderate levels from days when only one pollutant does. Data from the 1998 edition of Minnesota Milestones differ somewhat from data presented here because of revisions by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. In addition, the agency's reports formerly covered the state's four largest urban areas, but now cover all six of these pollutants only for the Twin Cities area. There are not enough monitoring stations in Rochester, St. Cloud and Duluth to calculate the Air Pollutant Standards Index in those cities."}
{"text":"Aerosols increasing over India\n\n[NEW DELHI] Aerosols \u2014 particles or droplets suspended in the air that impact climate by scattering or absorbing the sun's radiation \u2014 are increasing across India, new research shows.\n\nThe findings by S. Ramachandran and colleagues from the space and atmospheric sciences division of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, were published online last month (20 November) in Atmospheric Environment.\n\nPrevious Indian studies on aerosols considered India as an entire region or north India as a unit. They also took in just one season, such as winter or the pre-monsoon period from March to May.\n\nIn contrast, the new research studied aerosols in 35 locations across India and over the summer and winter seasons, from March 2000 to February 2010.\n\nScientists measured the 'aerosol optical depth' (AOD), the degree to which aerosols prevent light transmission by absorbing or scattering it, using data from MODIS (MODerate resolution imaging spectrometer), a key instrument aboard two US remote sensing satellites, Terra and Aqua.\n\nThey found a rise in annual AOD across 30 locations, while four \u2014 Trivandrum in the south and Chandigarh, Dehradun and Shimla in the north \u2014 showed a decline. The trends were higher in west and south India.\n\nThe annual mean (average) AOD increased by over 40 per cent between 2000 and 2009 in Jaipur, Hyderabad and Bengaluru cities. They rise in AOD over Hyderabad and Bengaluru was attributed to urbanisation, and in Jaipur to increased wind speeds that threw up dust from arid soil.\n\nSimilarly, the scientists reported a rise in AOD over New Delhi, attributing it to the burning of fossil fuel and biomass, and an increasing trend in AOD in India's northeast due to biomass-burning and forest fires.\n\nThe study found both AOD and rainfall increased in the last decade in most locations.\n\n\"Trends in aerosol characteristics on regional and seasonal scales in India, the focus of this study, are important to examine, understand and explain the effects aerosols have on summer monsoonal rainfall, and the inter-annual variations and trends in rainfall,\" the report said.\n\nThe seasonal and annual trends in AOD over different locations in India will prove useful in the assessments of regional and global climate impact due to aerosols, the scientists concluded.\n\nJayaraman Srinivasan, chairman of the Divecha Centre for Climate Change and professor at the Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the Indian Institute of Sciences, Bengaluru, expressed some reservations.\n\n\"The use of satellite data to study trends in aerosols over land is not reliable due to the large uncertainties involved in the satellite retrieval of AOD over land,\" Srinivasan told SciDev.Net.\n\n\"One must be wary of mistakenly interpreting noises and biases in satellite aerosol products as legitimate signals in long-term trends analysis,\" said Srinivasan, who heads a mega Indian research project on black carbon or soot and its environmental impact"}

{"text":"For the fifth year in a row, air pollution in the United States has declined, according to a new study by the American Lung Association. Despite the fact that the manufacturing industry and the population continue to grow, aggregate emissions in the U.S. have dropped by roughly 59% over the past 20 years. Of course, some regions continue to suffer from pollution levels that are considered too high. However, other metropolitan area have fairly clean air. 24\/7 Wall St. examined the 10 cleanest cities to find the reasons for their best air quality.\n\nThe 2012 State of the Air Report used data related to air pollution collected at Environmental Protection Agency monitoring stations in major metropolitan statistical areas all over the country. The data were collected in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Some cities, most of which were in California, reported dozens of days each year of unsafe levels ozone and particle pollution, while others reported not a single day of unsafe pollution. 24\/7 Wall St. tried to find out the reasons behind these differences.\n\nAccording to ALA's vice president of National Policy and Advocacy, Janice Nolen, the lack of pollution in these cities is less a product of a policy effort, but rather the result of small, sparse populations and a lack of polluting industries. When it comes to policy, \"In general, cities that are meeting the standard for particulate matter, especially these that are well below, probably aren't even addressing it. They aren't looking at it, because they don't have to,\" Nolen told 24\/7 Wall St. in a phone interview. \"These communities are so clean, relative to the standard, that this isn't even on their worklist.\"\n\nMany of the cities with the cleanest air are also relatively sparsely populated. Six of the 10 fall within the bottom 10% of the largest metropolitan areas for population density. Low population density can affect many pollution-related factors, including automobile pollution and the size of local industry. According Nolen, good airflow is also a major contributor to clean air and is something that a spread out population makes much more likely. This is because buildings are farther apart, there are fewer tall buildings, less auto congestion and, first and foremost, because population centers are located farther away from polluting sources.\n\nMost of the cleanest metropolitan areas also have smaller manufacturing sectors \u2014 in relation to their nonfarm economies \u2014 than the rest of the country. A relatively small manufacturing sector leads to less industrial pollution. The same is true for the mining, logging and construction industries in these regions.\n\nAdditionally, the cities are frequently hotspots for the leisure and hospitality sector. Not only does this sector in and of itself not normally produce an exceptional amount of air pollution, but it encourages the regions to limit their pollution. Dirty air is not particularly attractive to tourists.\n\n24\/7 Wall St. based its list on the cleanest cities for year-round particle pollution, as reported in the American Lung Association's State of the Air 2012 report. We also looked at reports from previous years to identify significant shifts in cities' rankings. We used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics regarding the size of relevant industries in each metropolitan area. Finally, we included population density data from the Census Bureau.\n\nMining, logging and construction, which account for 4.6% of the nation's nonfarm employment, account for less than 2% of nonfarm jobs in Anchorage. Similarly, while 9% of national nonfarm jobs are manufacturing related, in Anchorage they account for slightly more than 1%. In addition, Anchorage has the second-lowest population density in the country among the largest metropolitan areas, a fact that has helped the region preserve some of the cleanest air in the country.\n\nBoise City, which serves as the headquarters of the American Lung Association, is tied for the ninth-lowest score for long-term particle pollution in the U.S., an improvement from the previous year's report's 12th spot. Boise's population density, according to the report, is just 52 people per square mile, the 25th lowest among the largest metropolitan regions in the country.\n\nThe Flagstaff metropolitan area has a population density of just 7.2 people per square mile \u2014 easily the most sparsely populated metropolitan region in the country. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just 6.5% of the region's nonfarm jobs are in manufacturing, compared to a national average of 9%. The share of leisure and hospitality jobs, on the other hand, is nearly double that of the national level. On top of scoring eighth best in the country for year-round particle pollution, Flagstaff was also one of the cities to report the having no days with unhealthy levels of particle pollution over three years.\n\nThis city's leisure and hospitality sector, as a portion of the area's total nonfarm payroll, is significantly larger than the nation's. In addition, only 5% of the metropolitan area's jobs are in the manufacturing sector \u2014 just over half of the country's rate of 9%. Colorado Springs is now the seventh cleanest in the country when it comes to year-round particle pollution. This is quite a feat considering that, in last year's report, it did not even make the 25 cleanest cities.\n\nRedding, California, scored sixth best in the country for year-round particle pollution, an improvement from ninth best last year. However, the city did not make the list for either 24-hour particle pollution or ozone pollution. The metropolitan area is the 20th-most sparsely populated in the country at just 46.9 people per square mile.\n\nThe share of nonfarm employment in the manufacturing sector is just 4.8% in Albuquerque \u2014 significantly less than the national share of 9.0%. Albuquerque has among the cleanest air in the country as measured in both short-term and year-round particle pollution. Just one year ago, the metropolitan area was ranked much lower for year-round pollution and was not even ranked among the 25 cleanest for short-term pollution.\n\nTucson's long-term pollution score is the fourth best in the country, after being third best in last year's report. Tucson also was one of the cities reporting no unhealthy days of pollution between 2007 and 2009. In March, 6.5% of the region's employment was in manufacturing, compared to a national level of roughly 9%. The city also had a larger leisure and hospitality sector than the U.S. average.\n\nPrescott, Arizona, has one of the lowest rates of population density in the country. It also has a smaller manufacturing sector relative to the size of its overall economy than the U.S. has. From 2007 to 2010, the metropolitan region has not recorded a single day of unhealthy levels of air pollution.\n\nCheyenne, Wyoming, is easily the smallest city to make the Cleanest Cities in America list. It is also one of the smallest and most spread out of the largest metropolitan areas in the country. Cheyenne is one of the 79 cities that did not have a single day of unhealthy particle pollution levels between 2007 and 2009. According to the BLS, manufacturing accounts for just 3.3% of the city's economy, barely more than a third of the national average of about 9%.\n\nThe Santa Fe-Espa\u00f1ola metropolitan area ranks best for year-round particle pollution, moving up from second-place in last year's report. From 2007 to 2010, not a single day with an unhealthy air pollution level was recorded. The metropolitan area is one of only two cities to rank either best or among the best for year-round particle pollution, short-term particle pollution and ozone air pollution. Santa Fe's biggest industries, such as tourism and government, are hardly \"dirty.\" Additionally, New Mexico has particularly strict emissions standards."}

{"text":"Researchers have discovered that your level of exposure to pollution can vary according to what method of transport you use, with travelling by taxis resulting in the highest levels of exposure and walking the least.\n\nResearch published in the journal Atmospheric Environment, describes how the team from Imperial College London and the Health and Safety Laboratory, Buxton, measured and visualised exposure to pollution levels, while using a variety of different transport methods for travelling across London.\n\nThe researchers looked at five modes of transport, including walking, cycling, car, taxi and bus, and measured levels of exposure to ultrafine particles when travelling on them using a newly developed system that uses in combination an ultrafine particle counter and video recorder.\n\nUltrafine particles are less than 100 nanometres in diameter and mainly traffic related. Their small size and large surface area means it is possible to inhale large quantities which makes them particularly dangerous.\n\nThe visualisation system allows video images of individuals' activities to be played back alongside the ultrafine particle concentrations they are exposed to. As a result, most activities and behaviours that cause high exposures can be visibly identified, such as being trapped on traffic islands and waiting in congested traffic.\n\nOn exposure to 40,000 pt\/cm3, cycling was around 80,000 pt\/cm3, and walking was just under 50,000 pt\/cm3.\n\nSurbjit Kaur, from Imperial College London, and first author of the paper, said: \"It was a real surprise to find the extent to which walking resulted in the lowest exposure.

In 2009, the amounts of toxic nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere exceeded the maximum permitted levels at no fewer than 55 percent of air monitoring stations in urban areas. The ministry reports that road traffic is one of the primary sources of these emissions. In light of this fact, the Baroque city of Fulda is currently embarking on new ways to combat air pollution.\n\nSpecial paving slabs that will clean the air are to be laid the length of Petersberger Stra\u00dfe, where recorded pollution levels topped the annual mean limit of 40 micrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg\/m3) last year. These paving slabs are coated with titanium dioxide (TiO2), which converts harmful substances such as nitrogen oxides into nitrates. Titanium dioxide is a photocatalyst; it uses sunlight to accelerate a naturallyoccurring chemical reaction, the speed of which changes with exposure to light.\n\nThe \"Air Clean\" nitrogen oxide-reducing paving slabs were developed by F. C. N\u00fcdling Betonelemente. Proof of their effectiveness has subsequently been provided by the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME in Schmallenberg, where researchers also determined the risk to the environment posed by the resulting nitrates. Their work was funded by the German Environment Foundation.\n\nDr. Monika Herrchen, a scientist at the IME, says: \"Experiments in Italian cities had already shown that photocatalytic paving slabs can improve the air quality. We wanted to see if they would also be effective here in Germany, where we have lower levels of light intensity and fewer hours of sunshine. Of course, the more intense the sunshine, the quicker the degradation of harmful substances, so our aim was to identify the formula with the highest photocatalytic efficiency rating.\"\n\nTo begin with, concrete manufacturer F.C. N\u00fcdling produced a range of sample slabs incorporating different surfaces, colors, types of cement and TiO2 contents. Since the nitrogen oxide degradation rates achieved using standard commercial photocatalytic cement (i.e. cement that reacts to solar radiation) proved unsatisfactory, the company ultimately had to develop its own, more effective formula. \"We were able to verify the effectiveness of the optimized slabs in a variety of tests,\" confirms Herrchen. During an extended time field test, the scientist and her team recorded nitrogen oxide degradation rates of 20 to 30 percent in specially-created street canyons.\n\nThe measurements were taken at a height of three meters above the photocatalytic slabs, in variable wind and light conditions. When the wind was still, the experts recorded degradation rates as high as 70 percent for both nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Measurements likewise taken at a height of three meters above the Gothaer Platz in Erfurt, which is already paved with Air Clean paving slabs, revealed an average degradation rate of 20 percent for NO2 and 38 percent for NO.\n\nHerrchen points out an additional benefit of these paving slabs: \"They also remain stable over the long term. Measurements recorded from 14 to 23 months after they were laid revealed no change from the initial degradation capability.\" Furthermore, the nitrate that is generated during the conversion process poses absolutely no risk to the environment. It runs off into the drainage system, then into a wastewater treatment plant, before finally ending up on a farmer's field or in the groundwater. The maximum possible nitrate concentration traceable back to photocatalytic reactions is around five milligrams per liter (mg\/l), while the maximum permitted concentration of nitrate in groundwater is 50 mg\/l. Herrchen sums up: \"All in all, it's possible to say that Air Clean significantly improves the air quality within a short space of time, and thus helps protect the environment"}
{"text":"Nearly every state has a different standard when it comes to auto emissions. Some are more lax, whereas others are quite rigorous. Depending upon what city you live in, you may or may not have to get these kinds of tests done. The Clean Air Act requires local municipal governments to enact testing standards in cities whose air quality level does not meet federal standards. Other states simply mandate periodic testing regardless of what city you live in. There are 28 states and the District of Columbia that order periodic emissions testing, and two states that demand testing upon the sale or transfer of any vehicle.\nAs you can see, the majority of Americans have to submit to auto emissions testing at some point(s) in their lives. While these may seem like an unnecessary pain, these tests help control pollution levels to improve air quality. Cars release harmful toxins into the air each time they are used, which negatively impacts the entire planet. In fact, auto emissions are a leading contributor to global warming. If left unregulated, vehicle emissions would enhance what is already a serious problem worldwide."}
{"text":"I was analyzing air pollution data recently for an in-depth reporting project on air quality and health, and I came across a small victory in Southern California's war against smog.\n\nFine-particle pollution \u2014 tiny pieces of soot, dust, chemical compounds and other microscopic airborne gunk \u2014 has declined to healthful levels in Riverside in the spot where a plaque marks the first plantings of the Washington navel orange tree at Magnolia and Arlington avenues.\n\nI can say that the air around the historic citrus landmark meets the federal standard for fine-particle pollution because the South Coast Air Quality Management District operates an official air quality monitoring station a stone's throw away, across Magnolia Avenue.\n\nThe Washington navel was imported from Brazil and first planted in Riverside in 1873 by citrus pioneer Eliza Tibbets. This variety of orange offered large, sweet and seedless fruit. The demand for oranges in a newly railroad-connected nation helped the Inland area become a citrus empire. And the Washington navel is still one of the most popular citrus varieties ever.\n\nNow, people who visit the historic plantings can know that they won't be affected by fine particles, at least not there. The pollution has been linked to an array of afflictions, including aggravated asthma, stunted lung development, heart disease, cancer and early death.\n\nIn 2010, and again in 2011, the air quality district's nearby station measured fine particles \u2014 called PM 2.5 \u2014 at levels just below the federal health standard. Until 2010, the PM 2.5 had been at unhealthful levels since the air district began monitoring the pollutant in 1999.\n\nClear skies above the air quality monitoring station on Magnolia Avenue in Riverside.\n\nYet the news isn't all good.\n\nSouthern California won't be in compliance with the federal health standard for PM 2.5 until all the monitoring stations in the air basin between the Pacific Ocean and the San Bernardino Mountains fall below an annual average of 12 micrograms per square meter of air.\n\nData isn't available yet for 2012 yet, but for the previous year, 10 monitoring stations detected unhealthful levels of PM 2.5. They include five station in Los Angeles County; two stations in Jurupa Valley (Mira Loma and Rubidoux), and the stations in Onatario, Fontana and San Bernardino.\n\nIn addition, Southern California and the Inland region in particular still have a long way to go before another kind of pollution \u2014 ozone \u2014 meets federal standards.\n\nThe air monitoring station on Magnolia Avenue is not equipped to measure ozone, but the nearest station that does \u2014 in Rubidoux \u2014 logged 67 unhealthful days for that pollutant in 2011. The region's worst ozone pollution was in the mountain community of Crestline, which exceeded clean air standards on 84 days in 2011.\nStill, it is noteworthy that Riverside, a city long beset with bad air quality, now can say it no longer has unhealthful levels of fine-particle pollution.\n\nRon Loveridge\n\nI'd say that former Mayor Ron Loveridge can take some of the credit. He just retired after serving the city as an elected officials for 32 years. His civic tenure included seats on the air district board as well as the state Air Resources Board, the entities that imposed the regulations that are now reducing Southern California's air pollution"}

Still using technologies from the mid-20th century, the Glen Lyn plant burns hundreds of train-car loads of coal every day \u2013 at a cost of more than 20 lives\/year from pollution.\n\n\nAfter coughing through a streak of bad air days late last July, the dirty Bristol air finally proved too much for Marjorie of Bristol, Virginia. Marjorie, who suffers back problems and an asthmatic sensitivity to air pollution, eventually coughed so long and hard that she ruptured a disk in her back. Now, invasive back surgery is needed to repair the damage.\n\nNot every morning begins so dismally in Bristol, a city that straddles the Tennessee border in the far western part of Virginia, but bad air can ruin anyone's day. On most summer mornings, Marjorie wakes up and checks the online EPA air quality report,  to see what kind of day the wind will bring. For Marjorie, and thousands of other vulnerable Virginians, how dirty the air is will determine what she can do that day. A typical day will score in the \"code yellow\" range on the EPA's air quality index, but the air can get far worse than that when the atmospheric conditions conspire to allow air pollutants to accumulate.\n\nA 'code orange' day is considered unsafe for \"sensitive\" people: children, older adults, those exercising outdoors, asthmatics and others who suffer from respiratory disease.\n\n\"There are even code red ozone days now in the summer in the Southeast,\" says Marjorie, \"which means even normal healthy children shouldn't play outside. On a bad air day, I have to walk the dog early in the morning before things heat up and the air gets worse. I can't do any outdoor work and stay inside with the air purifiers on.\"\n\"As the summer drags on I get wheezier and wheezier, and I use my inhaler more and more. I cough more and more until I can't sleep,\" says Marjorie, who recently had to go on Prednisone to alleviate her asthma.\n\n\"It's a terrible thing to be short of breath, and have to use steroids to breathe,\" she says.\n\nThe source of the pollution that afflicts Marjorie is no mystery: coal-fired power plants are responsible for the majority of the air pollution in southwest Virginia. In the case of Bristol, a major source of that pollution is American Electric Power's Clinch River power plant, a large coal-burning plant, built in the 1950's, that has installed only minimal pollution control technology. The plant is located just 25 miles north of the city.\n\nAEP's other Virginia plant in Glen Lyn is about 30 miles west \u2013 and upwind \u2013 of the city of Blacksburg. Built in 1944, Glen Lyn is the oldest power plant in the state. Like the Clinch River plant, the only pollution control technologies installed at Glen Lyn are inexpensive precipitators to catch ash, and \"Low NOx Burners\" that were mandated by the EPA and the state in order to reduce ozone pollution downwind.\n\nAccording to a report by the American Lung Association, more than 450,000 people live within 30 miles of one of these two power plants. An abundance of recent medical research demonstrates that that is a significant health risk. A study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that fine particles fall in a 'cone of death.' According to the study, \"The risk of death to people living within 30 miles of the plants was found to be 3-4 times that of people living farther away.\"\n\nThis increased risk is the result of sulfur-dioxide (SO2) emissions combining with other air-borne pollutants to form microscopic specks, called fine particles, that irritate the lungs and increase the risk of lung disease when inhaled. Small particles can also make their way from the lungs into the bloodstream, causing a greatly increased risk of heart disease and even death.\n\nThis health risk is significant in southwest Virginia: Blacksburg and Bristol are losing 15 and 26 citizens every year, respectively, based on EPA models. And while Virginia as a whole suffers a significant air quality problem \u2013 the state recently scored a grade of \"F\" in the American Lung Association's 2005 \"State of the Air\" report \u2013 these two cities downwind of AEP plants share the dubious distinction of making the list of the nation's top twenty cities for death rates attributable to fine particle pollution from power plants.\n\nIt's statistics like these that make many southwest Virginia residents skeptical of AEP's claim that it \"makes every effort to protect the communities neighboring our facilities.\" Based on EPA figures, the Clinch River plant kills an estimated 59 people every year from its particle pollution alone, while the more rural Glen Lyn plant kills 21.\n\nThe technology to clean up power plant pollution has existed for decades, and now costs half or less of what it once did. Massive filters, known as a scrubbers, can virtually eliminate sulfur dioxide pollution when installed on a smokestack, promising a breath of fresh air for communities nearby.\n\nSo why haven't scrubbers been installed on AEP's two coal-fired power plants in Virginia? By AEP's cost estimation method, cleaning up both plants' SO2 pollution would cost $270 million. With the company's status as the largest electricity generator in the US, and having enjoyed a gross profit of $7.6 billion in 2005, any claims of financial hardship are likely to ring hollow.\n\nIn fact, there's little evidence that AEP has ever done more than the bare minimum to protect the communities who live downwind from its plants. When it has installed pollution controls, say critics like Hitt, it was spawned by legislation followed by litigation to enforce reluctant executives to comply with the law.\n\nOf the dozens of coal-fired plants AEP operates across 11 states, it has installed scrubbers on just 6 plants. Only one of those was installed before 2001. According to Pat Hemlepp, AEP's director of corporate media relations, the company plans to install 8 more to comply with new federal regulations. Unfortunately for Marjorie and other residents of southwest Virginia, the Clinch River and Glen Lyn plants did not make the list of plants slated for cleanup.\n\nWhat is particularly galling to Virginia ratepayers, though, is AEP's recent move to raise electricity rates in southwest Virginia to pay for its cleanup in neighboring states, a move made possible by Virginia's recent deregulation of its utilities. The company seeks to be reimbursed around $13 million dollars for its West Virginia cleanup so far, and will be asking Virginians for millions more as cleanup continues over the next several years.\n\nWhen it comes to lobbying, however, AEP has been considerably less stingy. The company spent $7,261,051 between 1998 and 2004 on lobbying efforts to influence the rules and regulators that govern it, according to the Center for Public Integrity.\n\n\"This is a classic Washington 'follow the money' story,\" says Public Citizen's Congress Watch Director Frank Clemente. \"When the electric power industry faced strong government attempts to clean up many of its aging coal-fired power plants, an action that would cost the utilities billions, a few dozen corporations and their trade association began an intensive campaign to derail the effort.\"\n\nClemente believes that the industry's strategy was largely successful, as almost all regulatory changes coming out of the White House in recent years have been heavily tilted toward the interests of industry. Moreover, there has been a constant stream of bills in Congress over the same time period designed to weaken various provisions of the Clean Air Act.\n\nLost in the loopholes\n\nEven if utilities recognize that they will eventually be forced to clean up or close down their dirtiest power plants, there are lucrative reasons to delay the process.\n\"These guys play for time,\" said Eric Schaeffer, former chief of environmental regulation at the EPA who resigned in protest at White House attacks on the foundations of clean air law. \"They know they are going to have to scrub these units, but the longer they put it off, the more money they make.\"\n\nAccording to Schaeffer, that adds up to millions of dollars per year \u2013 more than enough to justify the cost of top-notch lobbyists and lawyers.\n\nBut in March of 2005, the regulatory landscape changed dramatically for the power companies when the EPA finalized its Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). That rule, if enforced and complied with by utilities, is projected to reduce national sulfur dioxide emissions by close to 60% over the next decade. However, as with other past regulatory attempts to clean up the dirtiest plants, CAIR has loopholes.\n\nMost worrisome to southwest Virginians, CAIR contains 'Cap and Trade' style regulations. While popular with legislators and industry because they allow power companies to flexibly and cost-effectively meet pollution regulations, this approach does not deal well with local pollution problems of mercury and SO2. Instead of telling each individual plant how much it has to reduce its pollution, the EPA now sets a nation-wide ceiling or \"cap\" on a pollutant. Then, working with states, it divvies out the rights to emit this pollution. Larger plants receive more 'credits' \u2013 the right to emit one ton of a pollutant \u2013 than smaller plants. If a plant cleans up and no longer needs all of its allotted credits, by 'over-controlling,' it can sell these extra credits to plants polluting more than their share. Another option for a company like AEP is to over-control at one of its plants and use the extra credits to keep polluting, or increase pollution its dirtier plants.\n\nThough most agree that strategy has been successful in reducing pollution on the large scale, the implications of this type of regulation on the local scale remain controversial. AEP's plan to comply with the new stricter air regulations makes effective use of the \"cap and trade\" loophole.\n\nAs a result of CAIR, AEP must spend $4.1 billion through 2010 on pollution controls, and another $1.5 billion by 2020. However, AEP's pollution reduction strategy, made possible by \"cap and trade\" regulation, is to clean up a few newer, larger plants, where it can gain the most credits. Those credits will be used to keep smaller and older plants like Clinch River and Glen Lyn online, still polluting like they were the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThe result is that costs are passed along to rate-payers, either through the cost of building a scrubber or through the cost of buying pollution credits, even if those particular rate-payers, as in the case of southwest Virginia, will not benefit very much, if at all from the clean-up for which they are paying. The SO2 credits AEP will use for its excess VA pollution are worth $20 million, money not being spent on scrubbers close to home.\n\nElectric power meets people power\n\nThe problem of poor air quality is not lost on most Virginians, nor is it lost on state agencies such as the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. DEQ is already looking at stricter standards on mercury that would prevent utilities from trading credits out of state. But the powerful electric industry has a lot allies in the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates, and industry-promoted bills have been introduced into both chambers that would, according to Clean Air Advocates such as the Charlottesville-based Southern Environmental Law Center, \" \u2026 remove all discretion from the scientists at DEQ to regulate mercury in a manner best fitting the Commonwealth, and would force on Virginia the weakest regulations in [the] region.\"\n\nOn the brighter side for residents of southwest Virginia, a bill called the Virginia Clean Smokestacks Act was also introduced into both chambers of the Virginia Legislature in January. A similar bill died last year in a House Committee, but supporters like Donna Reynolds of the American Lung Association see a viable chance for the bill to gain a full vote in the House of Delegates this year. The committee votes are scheduled for late January and early Feruary \u2013 soon after this issue goes to press.\n\nAccording to Reynolds, \"Clean Smokestacks does what CAIR should have done\" by preventing companies like AEP from using credits it earned out of state to keep it's dirtiest plants from having to install better pollution controls. It would also impose a faster timetable for cleaning up pollution, but would not mandate SOx reductions beyond what is already written in the federal CAIR rule.\n\n\"Clean Smokestacks is not a radical proposal,\" says Mary Anne Hitt, \"it's about building off the many years of research that went into the federal CAIR rule and closing one important loophole to make sure that the health of every Virginian is protected.\"\n\nVirginia power\n\nIn deciding how to approach its pollution reduction strategy, Virginia's decision-makers can look to the experience of neighboring North Carolina, which passed its own Clean Smokestacks Bill in 2002. As a result of passing that act, North Carolina is creating thousands of jobs in its manufacturing and construction industries and is building two new wallboard manufacturing plants that use large amounts of gypsum, the waste product generated by scrubbers. Counties in southwest Virginia where AEP's plants are located could certainly use a similar influx of manufacturing jobs.\n\nBut clean air advocates in Virginia are more apt to talk about the many health benefits residents of western counties would enjoy should the region's air get cleaner \u2013 not to mention the dozens more Virginians that would still be around each year to enjoy that cleaner air.\n\n\"The VA legislature needs to step up and find solutions that will protect our families, our heritage, and our pristine environment,\" says Donna Reynolds of the American Lung Association. Virginia's clean air advocates vow to keep working until they succeed in closing the loophole \"that leaves southwest Virginia behind.\"\n\nINDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE MEETS THE MOUNTAINS \u2013 Many residents of Johnson County have little use for the pollution and visual scars CAFOs create across their beautiful mountain landscape.

Lance (below).\n\nVance Gentry, a dairyman himself, is one of the Johnson County residents supporting the CAFO.\nPhoto by Kent Kessinger\n\n\"No CAFO\" signs, like the one in Jack Mays' yard, have sprung up in yards all across Johnson County in the last few years.

By Kent Kessinger.\nimages\/AppalachianVoice\/AVJan06\/Photos\/circles\/Circle_CAFO.gif\n\nFor 33 years, eight months, and 20 days, Vance Gentry of Shady Valley in Johnson County, Tennessee milked cows at four in the morning and four in the evening. He still wakes up before his alarm even though he sold his herd two years ago, unable to make a living.\n\nJohnson County lies tucked in the Appalachian Mountains in the far northeast corner of Tennessee. It is a county rich in dairy farming, a tradition however that's been fading as small dairies become unsustainable for local farmers. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) are the new, large dairies that are surfacing all over the nation in rural communities.\n\nOver the past 20 years the number of dairies in Tennessee has dropped from 3,695 to 703. Gentry remembers 11 Grade A dairies in Johnson County alone. Now only one is left. The pressure of high production costs and low milk prices forced Gentry to join the scores of other dairymen that gave up their business after years of struggling to make ends meet. \"I was getting the same price for milk I was getting 25 years ago, while the cost of producing milk continued to increase,\" he said.\n\nDairymen buy their equipment, feed, water, etc. at retail prices but sell their milk at mandated wholesale prices leaving little room for earnings. \"You've got to make a profit and there's not a lot of incentives to keep you going,\" Gentry said. \"When it comes down to it, you have to have a bigger operation to maintain a profit.\" And that's exactly what is being built a few miles up the road near the town of Mountain City.\n\nThe controversy surrounding a new 690-cow CAFO has polarized the Mountain City community, driving families and churches apart as its residents grapple with the economic and environmental impact this new dairy will have on their town. As the first CAFO in the county, High Mountain Holsteins, in partnership with Maymead Inc, is set to begin milking in June leaving behind a trail of battles. Part of what has stirred opposition to the CAFO is the large number of cows that are kept and fed in a confined area with little access to sunlight, fresh air, and movement. The over 20,000 CAFOs in the U.S. produce 575 million pounds of manure a year, which is stored in lagoons and sprayed on surrounding property. Since 2003, the EPA has set mandatory regulations on CAFOs with additional regulation set by each state.\n\nIn the wake of large CAFOs there have been concerns about environmental and economic safety. Counties in six states have enacted moratoriums on new CAFOs awaiting more research on public health affects, environmental damage, and public nuisances. North Carolina recently renewed its ban on any new hog CAFOs after 25 million gallons of hog waste spilled into the New River. In 2003 Mountain City citizens formed the Watauga Watershed Alliance (WWA, formally J4CAW) in the hopes of preserving the local environment and watersheds from the impending CAFO.\n\nWWA President Dennis Shekinah thinks the loss of industry has left the Mountain City area economically depressed and susceptible to large operations moving in. Many people are looking for work. A family that has owned land in town for a century owns Maymead Inc. along with a local gravel company that employs many people in the area. It is this family community and business stronghold of the town that Shekinah says makes it difficult for citizens to stand against the CAFO. \"There is a sense among small farmers in the area that they don't have any other choice,\" he said.\n\nIn the 1980s there was a milk surplus in the U.S. and the government bought and slaughtered dairy cows in the hopes that fewer dairies would increase milk prices. But according to Tom Womack of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA), \"Tennessee hasn't seen it occur.\" Very few dairymen ever returned to milking. Ever since the county has been starved for jobs and according to the 1999 Census Bureau, 22.6% of Johnson County residents live below the poverty level.\n\nJack Mays grew up in Mountain City and had a 75-cow dairy in 1985. Nine years later he went bankrupt. \"It took 5 or 6 years to get out of debt,\" Mays said. \"When I started dairying it was 14 dollars for a 100 pounds of milk and when I quit it was 8 dollars a hundred. It just got so you couldn't make it. They've now skinned the whole county getting ready for CAFOs.\"\n\nMays says that although there were cows grazing on all the fields in the area when he was growing up a 690-cow dairy is different. Mays is particularly afraid that when this dairy CAFO is built, a hog or poultry CAFO will follow. \"It's a rotten deal and I don't understand how [local commissioners and residents] can stick their head in the sand and just let this damage be done to Johnson County,\" he said. \"This county will be 50 years recovering, I really believe that.\"\n\nAlthough dairies, particularly large ones, bring in support industry to the community like the plumbers, electricians, and farmers to grow feed for the cows of the CAFO, Mays worries in the long run it will hurt the local economy because it will drive away tourists or newcomers to the area.\n\n\"Property values will plummet,\" he said. \"People are going to quit moving here. Down the road us electricians, plumbers, painters are going to hurt without tourism or people moving to town. These people aren't going to pay this big money for these properties and smell cow manure and fight the flies. It's just a devastation to Johnson County.\"\n\nThe site for the CAFO is near Roan Creek, which was declared endangered by the Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation (TDEC) and in 2005 considered the 5th most endangered river in the nation by American Rivers, a national environmental organization. The creek was put on TDECs 303d list which restricted TDEC from allowing any new pollutants into the creek. WWA is concerned that the lagoons that hold the cow manure will leak into the ground water, Roan Creek, and flush into Watauga Lake. TDEC along with the help of TDA grants CAFO permits. They did grant a permit to High Mountain Holsteins.\n\nAccording to Tisha Calabrese-Benton of TDEC, \"The authority to regulate CAFOs is limited to aspects of the facility that affect, or are likely to affect, waters of the state. It is the duty of the Department to scrutinize every proposed operation to be sure that it meets all requirement of the rules.\" And according to TDEC, the High Mountain Holstein CAFO will not endanger the waterways. \"It is our responsibility to follow and enforce the laws and regulations that govern us for the protection of human health and the environment,\" she said.\n\nUniversity of Tennessee Dairy Specialist Kristy Hill maintains that there is no best terrain for the spread of cow manure. \"Each terrain has its challenges,\" she said.\n\n\"How [the manure] is applied, when it's applied, and how much it's applied will affect its potential to have a negative environmental impact.\" Although Shekinanh of WWA counters that \"even a well run CAFO still poses a huge risk for ground and public waters\" because of potential flooding and leaks into near by wells and springs.\n\nIn 2004 there was hope for those opposed to the CAFO in Johnson County. Early in the year, Johnson County Commissioners passed four resolutions that declared the CAFO \"not a normal agricultural activity.\" The resolutions gave the county legislative power to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens by prohibiting the CAFO. But the following September, the commissioners rescinded all four resolutions because state officials could not define 'normal' agricultural activity.\n\nIn September 2005 Johnson County Citizens Committee for Clean Air and Water (now Watauga Watershed Alliance) filed a lawsuit against the EPA because TDECs was not enforcing the Clean Water Act. The lawsuit was dismissed on grounds that the EPA has not determined that Tennessee is out of compliance and therefore the EPA has \"no non-discretionary or mandatory duty to perform.\"\n\n\"There would have to be a lot of damage before adequate regulations would be put in place,\" said WWA lawyer Joe McCaleb, \"but you'd hope that the state wouldn't allow that to happen.\"\n\nWWA founding member Steve Ferguson said, \"Anytime you're in an environmental struggle there will be points where you feel a loss and points where you feel a win. It's a long uphill struggle to educate and get support for a vision of the future that's built around an environmental stewardship. This is true of every environmental struggle. Perseverance over time is what will determine the end and a lot of people here are willing to persevere.\"\n\nHill of the University of Tennessee said that although she too wants a clean environment, the cost of regulations on dairies is very high in part because the government controls the price of milk. \"Expensive regulations are being forced on an already struggling industry, an industry that can't roll their increased cost of production onto consumers,\" she said.\n\n\"From an environmentalist's viewpoint, [regulations] may not be strict enough,\" Hill continued. \"From a producer's viewpoint, they are too strict. From my viewpoint, there are kinks in the system. The regulations were written prior to educating producers about environmental issues and agriculture. Had anyone spent some time to educate and work with producers at the fore-front on the affects of animal waste on the environment, waters would be a lot cleaner than they are today.\"\n\nBut Steve Ferguson of WWA thinks that the regulations are not nearly enough and the EPA no longer works for the betterment of the environment. \"The EPA is not the Environment Protection Agency, they are the Industrial Protection Agency,\" he said. \"The EPA has been shanghaied, de-toothed, sedated, and taken away.\"\n\nNonetheless, Shekinah still has hope for their fight with the CAFO even though many people in the community have given up. \"Spirits are high at WWA,\" he said. \"The dismissal of the lawsuit against the EPA is not the end of our fight; it simply defined the future of the fight [for] a clean productive community. We need to have more cooperation from local government and next year we will elect more proactive representatives and we will garner alliances with other community groups.\"\n\nBoth Shekinah and Hill agree that Americans demand cheap food and the industry will have to accommodate that fact, even if it means sending little operations out of business. Womack of TDA said, \"It's an economic advantage to have larger herds that small dairies can't weather. Higher production costs, low milk prices, labor demand, and an aging farm population make it tougher for small dairies to make a profit.\"\n\nBack in Shady Valley on the side of one of Gentry's milk barns is a peeling mural of cows being milked. He sold off the last of his dairy equipment this summer and was sad to see it go. \"Dairying was a good life,\" he said. \"Hopefully my children and grandchildren will keep the farm in the family, although I don't expect any of them to ever milk cows again.\"\n\nMaymead Inc. and High Mountain Holsteins declined to comment for this article.\n\nSHARP-EYED AND WAGGY-TAILED \u2013 Border Collies are renowned for their skill and agility \u2013 not to mention their enthusiasm \u2013 when it comes to herding.\n\nA LOVE TRIANGLE FOR THE AGES \u2013 The historic relationship between people, dogs and livestock goes back for millenia. In an age of big industrial livestock production, sheep dog enthusiasts like Colin Cleer keep this relationship alive more out of love than practicality.\n\nimages\/AppalachianVoice\/AVJan06\/Photos\/circles\/Circle_SheepDog.gif\n\nIt is a windy October afternoon, the livestock trodden grass of an open field along the Cowpasture River in mountainous Bath County, Virginia, bristling slightly under the pressure of the breeze. Today Big Bend Farm, a quiet stretch of riverside pasture and woods belonging to Barbara Ray, is playing host to dozens of four-legged creatures\u2014not livestock, but dogs from all over the state and all over the east coast. With silken coats ranging in color from blue-black and frothy white to dusky spotted browns, these high-strung border collies have come with their handlers to enjoy a sport that is more than 130 years old.\n\nOne of the event's participants and sponsor of the annual Highland Sheep Dog Trial in April, Donald McCaig, stands nearby, his black and white border collie Luke poised obediently at his side. McCaig's wiry gray hair pokes out from under a green cap and his solid face is at once stern and intensely interested in these animals\u2014both sheep and dogs. He has been sponsor of Virginia's second oldest sheep dog trial for 19 years, though he does not plan to hold the event in 2006.\n\n\"Virginia is the biggest sheep state on the East Coast,\" says McCaig, \"and people will travel a good distance to participate in these trials.\" Sheep dog trials like the one McCaig hosts each April test both the dogs' ability to maneuver sheep as well as the handlers' ability to control the dogs through voice and whistle commands.\n\nIt is an age-old art that has its earliest recorded beginnings in Wales in 1873. The first sheep dog trial in the United States was held at the Chicago Exposition in 1885. McCaig says the trials were designed to help select the best breeding stock for working sheep dogs. \"These are the only livestock dogs in the world,\" McCaig notes of the impatient, ever willing to serve border collie. \"Everywhere there's livestock you'll see these dogs.\"\n\n\"It's a genetic strategy,\" McCaig says of the trials. \"These trials are so much harder than farm work that this is where the sires and dames for breeding stock are selected. The trials are a model of what the dogs do at home, only harder.\"\n\nAnd the sport is becoming ever more popular, even among handlers who are not farmers themselves, as both McCaig and Ray are. \"25 years ago, there were about 10 sheep dog trials in the U.S.,\" says McCaig. \"Today there are about 400 a year.\"\n\nVirginia hosts about 20 sheep dog trials each year, and both McCaig's Highland trial and Ray's event draw handlers from as far away as Michigan to compete, and a fair number of participants are established national competitors. McCaig says Virginia is home to six of the top sheep dog handlers in the country.\n\nAmong the more expert handlers in Virginia is Tom Wilson of Gordonsville. He has worked with border collies for more than 35 years. On his home farm in the foothills of the Blue Ridge, Wilson has 500 sheep and 120 cattle, providing his dogs ample opportunity to ply their trade.\n\n\"In competition, the dog's talent and nature have to come together,\" explains Wilson. \"The dog can't be too excitable. This work is very exact, and the dog has to be very obedient.\"\n\nWhile all sheep dog trials are a little different, the trial today at Big Bend Farm, like most trials, is designed to be nearly impossible. \"It is excruciatingly difficult to win,\" says McCaig. \"It is deliberately made difficult so it's on the edge of undoable. We are choosing the breeding stock for the ordinary farmer who doesn't have time to train.\"\n\nEach handler begins with 100 points, Ray explains as the trial gets underway, and has 10 minutes to encourage his dog to maneuver four sheep around an expansive field, through three gates, and into a quadrant-shaped corral. The competitors cannot gain points, only lose them. The trial judge deducts points for every flaw, and it is of no benefit to the handler and dog to finish early. \"Anything less than perfect results in a deduction of points,\" Ray notes, as she watches a handler maneuver his border collie around the field with voice and whistle commands. Winning scores are typically in the 90s.\n\n\"It's the most difficult dog training art form there is,\" McCaig adds, as he watches a spry collie crouch low to the ground, eyeing his little flock, waiting for his handler's next command. \"Supposedly it takes as many years as the dogs have legs and a tail to become trial ready.\"\n\nSome trials, like the Big Bend competition, host both novice dogs and handlers as well as expert participants. Wendy Villarreal of Michigan often competes in Virginia trials with her two border collies, Breezy and Dexter. She is a relative newcomer to competition, having started working with sheep dogs eleven years ago. She started competing eight years ago.\n\n\"I fell in love with the dogs when I saw the Oatlands trial in northern Virginia,\" Villarreal explains. \"I think the communication between the handler and the dog is fascinating.\"\n\nMcCaig says handlers can enter any dog of any age in the open trial, though he's only seen 10 dogs that were not border collies ever compete in a sheep dog trial. \"Sheep dogs make horrible pets,\" he says. \"They don't have an off switch. If they don't have this work, they get really squirrelly. They are not trained by treats and love. They're desperate to work.\"\n\nThe collies' vast intelligence and interest in herding is evident in the intense expressions of these dogs, who sit patiently at their owners' sides, watching the competition, as if quietly yet excitedly awaiting their turn to run. While Big Bend's trial doesn't draw many onlookers, McCaig's annual trial in neighboring Highland County drew 600 spectators last year. \"It surprises me,\" he says, \"that year after year we get more and more people who just come to watch.\"\n\nFor anyone who has a dog at home that he feels he struggled just to train to sit and stay, watching a sheep dog trial can be a humbling experience. Sometimes these collies belie a hint of stubbornness at masters who will not let them take after the small herd, but mostly they run, sit, lie down, circle, and approach the sheep with willing response to the handlers' voice and whistle directives. \"You can't force sheep to do anything,\" says McCaig, as he watches a stubborn ewe decline to enter the quadrant at the end of the run. \"You can only encourage them.\"\n\nThe same might be said of these amazing border collies. The handlers tap into the dogs' natural willingness to work and please. \"These dogs are genetic obsessive compulsives,\" notes McCaig with a laugh. \"And sometimes I think it transfers to their human handlers as well.\"\n\nMore information on sheep dog trials is available through the Virginia Border Collie Association, which you can visit online at  You can also visit the United States Border Collie Club at \n\nA CRITICAL RESOURSE FOR CONSERVATION Harvard Ayers and Mark Shelley of the Southern Appalachian Forest Coalition wait on the runway before taking a Southwings flight to view mountaintop removal operations in West Virginia.\n\nSouthwings, the environmental flying service of the South, is an organization of about a dozen dedicated, skilled pilots who fly environmentalists, journalists and decision-makers over Appalachian industrial development gone awry. These mostly volunteer aviators have flown us over forests devastated by clear cuts, over chip mills, over power plants, and over the decapitated mountains of the coal fields. They also work along the East and Gulf Coasts of the Southeast from Louisiana to the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nI met Southwings founder Hume Davenport in 1996, just before he moved from New Mexico back to his Tennessee hometown of Chattanooga. He had flown for several years for the famed environmental flying service LightHawk. He expressed to me his intent to establish his own flying service for the South. Since no such thing existed for us here in the Appalachians, I soon had three or four projects in mind for him, and the rest, so to speak, is history.\n\nThat history includes transporting about every environmental organization in the South to gain a better perspective on the many threats to our land and communities. Hume and his fellow pilots have flown about 1000 people (3-5 at a time) over the mountaintop removal areas of West Virginia and Kentucky. Their clients on the flights include journalists of many newspapers like the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times as well as magazines like National Geographic.\n\nOn one particular flight, I tagged along with Hume when he flew staff of US Congressman Frank Pallone over the coal fields to see the square miles of decapitated mountains. I remember hearing gasps of \"I can't believe this\" as we circled the industrial moonscape below. These Congressional staff were already very familiar with mountaintop removal from readings and pictures. But the view of it from only 1000 feet up was enough to prompt a phone call to me a week later. The staff woman told me, \"If I were not working for Mr. Pallone, I would be looking for a job in the coal fields to stop this abomination.\" That's the kind of support we need in the halls of Congress. Indeed, Mr. Pallone is a strong sponsor of the Clean Water Protection Act which would make mountaintop removal very difficult.\n\nOver their almost ten years of service, Southwings has gone from one pilot, Hume, to the current dozen. They have gone from searching for clients among environmental groups to being the go-to flying service for environmental issues for all the major media in the East. They have gone from scouring the funding sources in the Southeast to keep their planes in the air to leveraging substantial funding for the environmental groups they serve. And because they have become the go-to air service for environmental groups in the region, they find themselves as the go-betweens between states and regions, transferring important environmental tools from one group to another. In summary, in many ways, Southwings is the glue that draws environmental groups in the South together.\n\nFIGHTING THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR HOMELAND \u2013 Coalfield community groups such as Coal River Mountain Watch and the Ohio Valley Environmental Coaltion protest Massey Energy's destruction of their mountains and communities through mountaintop removal mining.\n\nBREATHTAKING BEAUTY IN THE BANKHEAD \u2013 Alabama's Bankhead National Forest hosts some of the most beautiful waterfalls and hiking trails in the South. Thanks to the efforts of groups such as WildSouth and Wildlaw, the Bankhead is now a model of a sustainably managed national forest.\n\nCHIPPING THE SOUTHERN FORESTS \u2013 As wood production shifted from the national forests in the west to private southern forests during the 90's, hundreds of satellite chip mills sprung up across the South.\n\nThe Appalachian Voice newspaper is celebrating ten years of providing a voice to the land and all its living things from across our Appalachian Mountain home. From a community in the coal fields of West Virginia threatened by mountaintop removal mining, to an endangered Indian site in the Bankhead National Forest of Alabama, to the disappearing vistas of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park of Tennessee and North Carolina, the Appalachian Voice has attempted to alert residents and visitors alike to the threats to our communities and to our environment.\n\nThe middle 90's were a time of a major awakening of environmental consciousness in the southern and central Appalachian Mountains. The major national environmental organizations such as the Sierra Club, the Nature Conservancy and the Audubon Society had been in existence in the region for decades, but these groups were mostly focused on national environmental issues rather than regional ones. Sneaking in under the radar screen of these national groups were threats such as the invasion of the Southeast by wood chip mills that grind up hardwood trees for grocery bags and mountaintop removal coal mining that blows up mountains and fills in valleys in central Appalachia.\n\nFast forward to 2006. Groups such as the sponsoring organization of this newspaper, Appalachian Voices, the Dogwood Alliance, Southwings, Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, Coal River Mountain Watch, Wild South and numerous others are on the scene working to protect our Appalachian Mountains against these and other threats.\n\nThis is the story of the vital work these groups have been doing over this last decade to protect Appalachian communities and our air, water, and forests and. It's also the story of the challenges we face in the future.\n\nMountaintop Removal Coal Mining in Appalachia\n\nStrip mining coal in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia has been practiced in our mountains for over 50 years. But a coal mining method called mountaintop removal has only been with us to any extent for the last 20 or so years. It is done by blowing up mountains with high explosives to get at deeper and deeper seams of coal, and pushing the rest of the mountain off into nearby valleys. Entire mountains are destroyed and small valleys filled in, essentially leveling the once mountainous terrain. Mountaintop removal is frequently called \"strip mining on steroids,\" and is the cheapest and also the most destructive way to mine coal.\n\nNot only are mountains leveled and the valleys filled in, but the Appalachian communities around these once mountainous regions are devastated. Now-treeless mounds of rock that were the mountains cause floods as they do nothing to stop rain water. These floods wash away homes and people as well. Dams holding back coal waste threaten schools and entire communities should they break like the Buffalo Creek disaster in Logan County, West Virginia, in 1973, which killed 125 people in a matter of minutes.\n\nLaw suits over the last eight years have had some success at stopping mountaintop removal. Joe Lovett, an attorney in Charleston, West Virginia, and other attorneys have won several suits, all of which have been at least partially overturned by the conservative Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, but several legal victories have been allowed to stand. The size of valley fills has now been reduced by one third to one half for mountaintop removal mines nationally. The proposed massive Spruce mine in Logan County has been rejected, the meaningless designation of the \"reclaimed\" mines known as fish and wildlife habitat is no longer accepted, and an expensive re-forestation of mined out sites has begun.\n\nJoe Lovett, however, has found his job increasingly more difficult over the last several years. \"The Bush Administration's anti-regulatory policies have made litigation and enforcement actions much more difficult at the state as well as the federal levels,\" Lovett explained. This anti-regulatory atmosphere in the coal fields no doubt played an important role in the recent underground mining deaths in West Virginia, as well as the deaths from floods induced by mountaintop removal and numerous fatal accidents at the mountaintop mines.\n\nGroups that have been active in recent years in opposing mountaintop removal include Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, Appalachian Voices, and Save Our Cumberland Mountains. One community group, Coal River Mountain Watch, has been successful in fighting the practice from inside the West Virginia coal fields. Based in Whitesville, West Virginia, Coal River has given a voice for the first time to many who are on the front lines of destruction.\n\nLocal citizens who never knew what to do in the past now protest the coal mining impacts to their state government, and have become players in the halls of Congress in Washington, DC, as well. They have succeeded in improving driving safety in the coal fields by gaining tighter enforcement of weight limits on huge coal trucks; caused Massey Coal to place a dome over a Sylvester, West Virginia, coal processing plant; and have stymied a coal processing plant expansion near Marsh Fork Elementary school in Sundial, West Virginia.\n\nThe Marsh Fork school is still impacted severely by the existing processing plant. But according to Bo Webb of Coal River Mountain Watch, \"We are determined to get those kids a new school about three or four miles up the river.\" He continues, \"We are now organizing citizens at nearby Horse Creek and Dry Creek to oppose the new mountaintop removal mines right above their heads.\"\n\nProtecting Alabama's National Forests\n\nForestry practices of the US Forest Service on the Bankhead and Talladega National Forests in Alabama have for decades been slanted toward maximizing the output of lumber. Harming other important functions of the forest such as providing recreation, wildlife habitat and a clean drinking water supply, massive clear cuts have been the rule in managing these forests. In many cases the native hardwoods have been replaced with fast-growing, non-native loblolly pines which are used to make paper products. These pine plantations have indeed become like any other crop such as corn or cotton.\n\nIn 1991, Lamar Marshall, an Alabama native, had had enough. He founded the Bankhead Monitor, a non-profit, educational corporation to stop the destruction of these public lands. The primary instrument for public involvement in decisions about the forests was a magazine called the Bankhead Monitor. In 1996, public demand for the magazine and the grassroots-based protection activities of Lamar and his associates led to an expansion of his work and a change in the publication's name to Wild Alabama, and in 2004, regional work expanded the organization to a new name, the current Wild South.\n\nWild South with strong support from an environmental law firm, WildLaw, spent a decade of putting pressure on the US Forest Service to change their ways. Administrative appeals, law suits, and grassroots pressure from those citizens that spent time enjoying these National Forests finally succeeded.\n\nAccording to Marshall, \"In 2003, the federal managers of the Bankhead and Talladega National forests turned over a new leaf. For starters, they eliminated the emphasis on lumber production. Even more impressively, the Forest Service decided to stop converting native hardwoods to pine plantations, and in fact began a reforestation plan to convert thousands of acres of the plantations back to native hardwoods. Further, they established thousands of additional acres that would be managed as old growth forests where trees would not be cut down at all and trees could grow till they died of old age at 200-300 years.\"\n\nProtecting Private Forests\n\nOn the southern forests that are owned by private landholders, 80-90 percent of the forest total, massive clear cuts have also been the rule rather than the exception. Despite replanting of seedlings, in many cases replacing native hardwoods with pines, this clear cutting is not sustainable over the long haul. With removal of all the tree cover, massive erosion can occur and loss of critical topsoil is difficult to prevent, reducing the fertility and productivity of the land.\n\nIn the early 1980's, about a decade prior to the dawn of regional environmental group beginnings, a new challenge to southern forests appeared. For decades the tree-to-pulp-to-paper industry had depended not only on massive pine plantations along the coasts of the South, but had been getting much of its natural resource in the forests of spruce and fir in the Northwest of Washington, Oregon, and nearby states and Canadian provinces. But by about 1980, those supplies had been exhausted, so the South became the national focus of logging for the country for the first time since the turn of the century, when 90 percent of the region's forests were clear cut. Thus, by the 1980s, both the exhaustion of the Northwest forests and the recent re-growth of forests in the South combined to make southern hardwood forests ripe for the harvest.\n\nEnter the wood chip mill industry. They needed trees to chop up to make pulp and paper, and we had it. It was not in the form of pines but mainly of hardwoods and it didn't matter what size. By the time we realized it, dozens of these giant pencil sharpeners had set up in the Southeast, and our hardwood forests began disappearing much faster than when only lumber was being extracted.\n\nFortunately, in the early and middle 90s, groups like the Dogwood Alliance, Wild South, Appalachian Voices, and Western North Carolina Alliance appeared and blew the whistle on the chip mill invasion. We began educating southern landowners and others about the damage to our forests including reducing their future productive capacity of lumber wood. The chip mills were chipping up the so-called growing stock, the future lumber trees.\n\nWithin a couple of years, the stream of new chip mills had all but dried up, either because we had stopped them or because there were enough of them to handle the needs of the industry. Since about 2000, there have been virtually no new chip mills in the region.\n\nAt that point, the private lands forestry movement split into two different complementary campaigns. One was concerned with spreading the practice of truly sustainable forestry, not what the industry refers to as sustainable forestry which is simply a steady stream of pulp and lumber production. By this term, we mean forests that sustain clean water, good animal habitat, and that retain the qualities of an old growth forest.\n\nTo get an idea of how some of our southern forests could truly sustainably produce lumber products and limited pulpwood, as most landowners desire, many of us journeyed to Missouri, where the 150,000 acre Pioneer Forest is located. Pioneer Forest was purchased in the early 50s by a far-sighted individual who wanted to produce wood products sustainably while making a substantial profit. His foresters were up to the challenge. They found that the original 150,000 acres were heavily degraded by massive clear cuts. But by taking the worst trees out of the forest at first, and encouraging the better trees, they were able to slowly but constantly improve the timber supply. Now after 50 years of selecting single trees for cutting while leaving the other trees intact, the lowest grade trees they now harvest are much superior to the best in the 50s. Clint Trammel, chief forester of Pioneer Forest, has mentored many from the Southeast in sustainable forestry.\n\nThe other segment of the groups at first working to stop chip mills began an innovative, well-conceived campaign to convince the corporate consumers of wood products that they should not buy timber that is cut in a non-sustainable way. These corporate consumers included Lowes, Office Depot and Staples.\n\nAccording to Scott Qaranda of the Dogwood Alliance, \"Through a combination of concerted public consumer pressure and meetings with corporate managers by our Dogwood Alliance, these wood product consuming giants of the industry agreed to purchase no old growth trees or trees that were produced by the worst of the massive clear cutting of native forests. So the idea was to dry up the demand for irresponsibly produced wood.\"\n\nBoth of the two prongs of the sustainable forestry movement have made further progress. Through landowner handbooks and on-the-ground demonstrations, groups such as Appalachian Voices are now training large numbers of individual private landowners to follow practices similar to those at Pioneer Forest.\n\nThe Dogwood Alliance has moved on to pressuring wood products producers to log sustainably. A recent success with timber giant Bowater according to Danna Smith, founder of Dogwood Alliance, \"will not allow them to purchase wood from a landowner who would covert native forests into pine plantations.\" While there is still work to be done, these activities are improving the quality of Southeastern forests. The best is yet to come.\n\nAir Quality\n\nThe southern Appalachians have some of the worst air quality on the North American continent. According to a study by National Parks Conservation Association and Appalachian Voices, the three national parks in the region, Great Smoky Mountains, Mammoth Cave, and Shenandoah National Parks are the three most air-polluted out of all 50 or so in the country. Our southern Appalachian cities represent the ten worst from across the country in terms of premature death rates from coal-fired power plant pollution. Trees in our mountains are declining and dying in many cases and many of the streams are acidified. Visibility in the parks is sometimes less than one mile due largely to power plant haze, and the toxic ozone readings in these parks at times rivals even that of big cities like Atlanta and even Los Angeles.\n\nWhile automobiles play the largest role in air pollution in the West, coal-fired power plants, even sixteen years after the latest Clean Air Act, are the main source of the majority of the serious air pollutants in our region. Power plants in the nearby Ohio and Tennessee valleys supply most of the mountain's pollution, but states such as North Carolina and Virginia have numerous such plants, and they do their share of the damage as well.\n\nSolutions to southern Appalachian air pollution must therefore include cleanup of power plants across region. Tennessee Valley Authority and American Electric Power, but also Duke Power and Progress Energy must clean up their act. The latter two energy companies have made a bold move in North Carolina by supporting the passage of the 2002 Clean Smokestacks Act. All the major pollutants other than carbon dioxide are being slashed by 60 to almost 80 percent at both Duke and Progress coal plants across the state, making the law among the strongest in the country. Virginia is currently considering similar legislation for passage this year.\n\nUnder the current anti-regulatory environment in Washington, DC, many challenges remain. Several attempts have already been made to weaken the existing federal Clean Air Act. And perhaps even more ominously, states are now, with federal blessing, considering building not only more coal-fired plants, but also new nuclear power plants.\n\nFighting these battles will take the maximum combined efforts of both the national environmental groups and the new generation of regional groups. These groups must rally the general public of the region to stand up to the powerful energy corporations and insist on maximizing conservation and efficiency improvements as well as renewable energy producible in the region, including solar and wind power."}

AppliancesoooNever use portable fuel-burning camping equipment inside a home, garage, vehicle or tent unless it is specifically designed for use in an enclosed space and provides instructions for safe use in an enclosed area.\n\noNever burn charcoal inside a home, garage, vehicle, or tent.\n\noNever leave a car running in an attached garage, even with the garage door open.\n\noNever use gas appliances such as ranges, ovens, or clothes dryers to heat your home.\n\noNever operate unvented fuel-burning appliances in any room where people are sleeping.\n\noDo not cover the bottom of natural gas or propane ovens with aluminum foil. Doing so blocks the combustion air flow through the appliance and can produce CO.\n\noDuring home renovations, ensure that appliance vents and chimneys are not blocked by tarps or debris. Make sure appliances are in proper working order when renovations are complete.\n\nWhat CO level is dangerous to my health?\n\nThe health effects of CO depend on the CO concentration and length of exposure, as well as each individual's health condition. CO concentration is measured in parts per million (ppm). Most people will not experience any symptoms from prolonged exposure to CO levels of approximately 1 to 70 ppm but some heart patients might experience an increase in chest pain. As CO levels increase and remain above 70 ppm, symptoms become more noticeable and can include headache, fatigue and nausea. At sustained CO concentrations above 150 to 200 ppm, disorientation, unconsciousness, and death are possible.\n\nWhat should I.\n\nAre CO alarms reliable?\n\nCO alarms always have been and still are designed to alarm before potentially life-threatening levels of CO are reached. The safety standards for CO alarms have been continually improved and currently marketed CO alarms are not as susceptible to nuisance alarms as earlier models.\n\nHow should a consumer test a CO alarm to make sure it is working?\n\nConsumers should follow the manufacturer's instructions. Using a test button tests whether the circuitry is operating correctly, not the accuracy of the sensor. Alarms have a recommended replacement age, which can be obtained from the product literature or from the manufacturer.\n\nHow should I install a CO Alarm?\n\nCO alarms should be installed according to the manufacturer's instructions. CPSC recommends that one CO alarm be installed in the hallway outside the bedrooms in each separate sleeping area of the home. CO alarms may be installed into a plug-in receptacle or high on the wall. Hard wired or plug-in CO alarms should have battery backup. Avoid locations that are near heating vents or that can be covered by furniture or draperies. CPSC does not recommend installing CO alarms in kitchens or above fuel-burning appliances.\n\nWhat should you do when the CO alarm sounds?\n\nNever ignore an alarming CO alarm! It is warning you of a potentially deadly hazard.\n\nIf the alarm signal sounds do not try to find the source of the CO:\n\noImmediately move outside to fresh air.\n\noCall your emergency services, fire department, or 911.\n\noAfter calling 911, do a head count to check that all persons are accounted for. DO NOT reenter the premises until the emergency services responders have given you permission. You could lose consciousness and die if you go in the home.\n\noIf the source of the CO is determined to be a malfunctioning appliance, DO NOT operate that appliance until it has been properly serviced by trained personnel.\n\nIf authorities allow you to return to your home, and your alarm reactivates within a 24 hour period, repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 and call a qualified appliance technician to investigate for sources of CO from all fuel burning equipment and appliances, and inspect for proper operation of this equipment. If problems are identified during this inspection, have the equipment serviced immediately. Note any combustion equipment not inspected by the technician and consult the manufacturers' instructions, or contact the manufacturers directly, for more information about CO safety and this equipment. Make sure that motor vehicles are not, and have not been, operating in an attached garage or adjacent to the residence.\n\n]]> Off High Efficiency Furnace or A\/C Installation\n 20 Nov 2012 05:42:17 +0000seogeeks on the Image to Download Our Coupon and Save Big Money with Our Great Promotions Must mention offer when setting up your initial appointment Offers can not be combined or used with any other offer. 1 offer per \u2026 Continue reading \u2192\n\nClick on the Image to Download Our Coupon\nand Save Big Money with Our Great Promotions\n\nMust mention offer when setting up your initial appointment Offers can not be combined or used with any other offer. 1 offer per household Offer not valid on diagnostics Crawl spaces and certain conditions are extra\n\n]]> Service Offers\n 20 Nov 2012 05:39:53 +0000seogeeks Click on the Image to Download Our Coupon Must mention offer when setting up your initial appointment Offers can not be combined or used with any other offer. 1 offer per household Offer not valid on diagnostics Crawl spaces \u2026 Continue reading \u2192\n\nMust mention offer when setting up your initial appointment\nOffers can not be combined or used with any other offer.\n1 offer per household\nOffer not valid on diagnostics\nCrawl spaces and certain conditions are extra\n\n]]> 16 Point Furnace Inspection\n 20 Nov 2012 05:38:51 +0000seogeeks on the Image to Download Our Coupon and Save Big Money with Our Great Promotions Must mention offer when setting up your initial appointment Offers can not be combined or used with any other offer. 1 offer per household Offer \u2026 Continue reading \u2192\n\nMust mention offer when setting up your initial appointment Offers can not be combined or used with any other offer. 1 offer per household Offer not valid on diagnostics Crawl spaces and certain conditions are extra\n\n]]> Off Heating Or AC Repair\n 20 Nov 2012 05:37:52 +0000seogeeks Click on the Image to Download Our Coupon and Save Big Money with Our Great Promotions Must mention offer when setting up your initial appointment Offers can not be combined or used with any other offer. 1 offer per household \u2026 Continue reading \u2192\n\n]]>\n 27 Oct 2011 17:20:46 +0000seogeeks old HVAC equipment looks like it was pieced together that was miss matched but when Dave and his crew showed up to replace it, he turned it into a master piece, like fine art work.

{"text":"Environment\n\nPromoting a Safe and Healthy Environment\n\nCitizen Action\/Illinois believes all citizens have a fundamental right to a safe and healthy environment in their communities and work place, as well as an obligation to maintain environmental quality for future generations.\n\nCitizen Action\/Illinois opposes legislative attempts to weaken key laws designed to protect the quality of air, water, land and natural resources and will work toward the maintenance of existing networks of safeguards.\n\nCitizen Action\/Illinois supports strong legislation to reduce air pollutants that are related to health problems and the environment.\n\nIllinois Campaign to Clean up Diesel Pollution\n\nThe Illinois Campaign to Clean up Diesel Pollution is a coalition of Citizen Action\/Illinois, the Respiratory Health Association of Metropolitan Chicago and more than 90 health, environmental, labor, faith and community organizations. We are fighting to reduce diesel pollution in Illinois, to protect the public's health and prevent global warming.\n\nThe black exhaust emitted from diesel vehicles, such as buses, trains and construction equipment not only looks and smells toxic \u2013 it is. Diesel exhaust contains over 40 hazardous air pollutants and is known to cause asthma attacks, heart attacks, lung cancer, strokes, and even premature death. Illinois ranks as the third state with the gravest health impacts from diesel. In Illinois, diesel pollution causes over 83,000 work loss days, 700 heart attacks, and nearly 600 premature deaths each year. Diesel pollution is not only bad for our health, but also significantly contributes to global warming.\n\nThere is a solution! Clean technology can eliminate up to 90 percent of the dirty soot emitted from diesel vehicles. The Campaign is taking action to ask our leaders to protect our health and environment by installing clean technology on Illinois' buses, trains and construction equipment.\n\nJoin Citizen Action\/Illinois' efforts to clean up the air by endorsing the Illinois Campaign to Clean up Diesel Pollution. Click here for the endorsement form. For more information contact Jonathan Doster at 312.427.2114 ext. 206.\n\nRecent Victories!\n\nChicago City Council passed Clean Diesel Contracting Ordinance\n\nIn April of 2011, the Chicago City Council passed unanimously the \"Clean Diesel Contracting Ordinance.\" Introduced by Mayor Daley and sponsored by the Chicago Department of Environment, the ordinance requires the use of cleaner diesel fuel and less-polluting diesel trucks and equipment to be used on city-funded construction projects.\n\nPresident Obama Signs the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2010\n\nDuring the 2010 federal Lame Duck session, the reauthorization of the DieselEmissionsReductionAct passed both chambers of Congress. The bill, cosponsored by Senator Durbin, is expected to provide $500 million in grants and loans over a five-year period for a variety of diesel cleanup options including retrofits and retirements of thousands of diesel engines nationwide.\n\nMetra Commits to Cleaning Up Locomotive Fleet\n\nOn November 7th, the Chicago Tribune published an in-depth, front-page story about the poor air quality on Metra trains. Through their own testing, the paper discovered air pollution inside Metra cars to be 72 times higher than outside, ambient air. As a result, Senator Durbin (alongside Respiratory Health Association of Metropolitan Chicago) held a press conference urging Metra, the EPA, and OSHA to find both short term and long term solutions. As a result, the transit agency decided to begin using 100% Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel fuel by April 1, 2011. Metra's also committed to look for funding to affix idling controls to 100% of their fleet. Lastly, in an effort to identify long term solutions, Metra has agreed to apply for federal funding to develop a cleaner engine prototype.\n\nIDOT Adopts Green Construction Policy\n\nIn 2009, Governor Quinn signed an Executive Order requiring that any equipment used during IDOT construction projects in the Metro East and Chicago Metropolitan areas be outfitted with pollution controls. The Campaign has been encouraging IDOT to adopt strong regulations to implement the Governor's order. This year, IDOT officially adopted a strong green construction policy mandating the use of pollution controls on most equipment that reduce diesel soot pollution by 50 percent. Citizen Action\/Illinois and the Campaign are pleased with these regulations and want to offer thanks to all those who worked hard for their passage.\n\nChicago City Council Adopts Idling Limit\n\nThe Chicago City Council passed an ordinance to update the city's air pollution code. Included in the ordinance is the city's first ever idling limit aimed at reducing pollution from diesel trucks and buses. Drivers who idle such vehicles longer than 3 minutes will face a $250 fine. Chicago Police, city parking and traffic enforcement officials, and the Commissioner of the Environment have the authority to enforce this limit. Passage of the ordinance means Chicago now has the strongest engine idling prohibitions in the Midwest. New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington DC already have diesel engine idling limits of 3 minutes or less.\n\nGovernor Quinn Signs Diesel Anti-Idling Bill\n\nGovernor Quinn signed legislation (HB 2664) to strengthen the state's 10 minute diesel vehicle idling limit by increasing the fines. Under the new law, fines for violators will increase from $50 to $90 for first offense and from $150 to $500 for subsequent offenses. In order to provide an incentive to local governments to enforce the law, the legislation allows local governments to keep a portion of the fine. A portion of the fine will also fund anti-idling education efforts by the Illinois EPA. Supporters of the Illinois Campaign to Clean up Diesel Pollution sent nearly 200 emails to their state legislators asking them to support the bill.\n\nCook County Board Passes Green Construction Ordinance\n\nThe Cook County Board of Commissioners recently approved a Green Construction Ordinance that will require all public county construction projects, costing $2 million or more, to use clean fuel and technology that removes up to 90% of dirty soot from their equipment.\n\nWith the announcement, Cook County will become the first County in the Midwest to adopt a green construction ordinance. The efforts of Citizen Action\/Illinois and our Illinois Campaign to Clean Up Diesel Pollution coalition partners were crucial in making sure this ordinance passed. Thank you!\n\nFor more information or to learn how you can participate, please contact Jonathan Doster at 312.427.2114 ext. 206."}
{"text":"BESTECH staying ahead of legislative emissions curve\n\nBESTECH operates the largest SO2-monitoring network in Canada which has 17 SO2 monitoring stations and two environmental stations. The fixed data collection stations gather ambient SO2 data, solar radiation, station temperatures, air temperatures at various elevations and speeds, in addition to wind direction.\n\nBESTECH has renewed its contract to\noperate Sudbury's sulphur dioxide monitoring network for another\nfive years, the second such renewal since the company took over\noperation of the network in 2003.\n\nThe company is responsible for\nmonitoring the SO2 emissions from Sudbury's two biggest emitters,\nVale and Xstrata Nickel, and reporting to the province to ensure they\ndon't go over their emissions limits.\n\nData is provided in real\ntime, and is made public, according to ministry stipulations.\n\nPat Dubreuil, BESTECH's\nvice-president of operations for sales and marketing, said the\ncompany's role is to ensure the companies are following\nregulations.\n\n\"Vale and Xstrata had a control\norder, which gives special permission to emit, because the technology\nthat they were using didn't enable them to meet the provincial\nstandards,\" he explained. \"So they had these limits, and they're\nfined if they exceed these limits. Our role is to create a\ntransparent, third-party bridge to provide that data back to them and\nhelp them control their emissions.\"\n\nPrevious to 2003, when the province was\nrunning the network, companies were posting their emissions numbers\non their own websites. BESTECH has implemented a number of\ninnovations since taking over the network, including setting up a\nmonitoring station at Science North that collects air samples and\nfeeds the data back to the companies. An interactive display\nillustrates where the 17 stations are in Sudbury and gives readings\nfrom those stations.\n\nBESTECH's SO2 mobile unit is capable of providing real-time readings to operators and the public website. The system is used to confirm public air quality complaints.\n\nIn 2007, the company retrofitted a\nToyota RAV4 into a mobile monitoring station for Vale that is\ndispatched to monitor strategic areas throughout the area.\n\n\"It's pretty cutting edge,\"\nDubreuil said. \"There aren't any other networks out there that do\nthat, and BESTECH basically put that together for them.\"\n\nFrank Javor, Vale's manager for\nenvironment, air, for Ontario operations, said the monitoring is an\nessential tool to the company's emissions reduction program.\n\n\"For us, the data is very important,\nnot just from the legal perspective, but we use the information, as\ndoes Xstrata, in real time to control the operations of our smelter,\"\nhe said. \"So to make sure that we don't have an elevated\nconcentrated level of sulphur dioxide in the community.\"\n\nVale has been pleased with BESTECH's\nperformance, and even with the Clean AER project, a $2-billion\nproject that is aiming to reduce Vale's emissions by 70 per cent of\ncurrent levels, the company will still rely on the SO2 monitoring\nnetwork, Javor said.\n\n\"Our emissions will go down very\nsubstantially, but we will still want to control and make sure we\nhave good air quality in Sudbury, and the same with Xstrata,\" Javor\nsaid.\n\nIn addition to Vale and Xstrata Nickel,\nIron Ore Canada in Newfoundland also uses BESTECH's network. The\ncompany is now marketing the system in Latin America, in places like\nChile where rock formations present ideal places for pollution to\ncongregate and a nightmare for companies to regulate. By gathering\nweather data, the system is able to predict when an excess of\npollution may occur, signalling a need for an emitter to curb its\nemissions.\n\nBESTECH is also looking ahead to future\nregulations. Legislation is changing to require emitters to provide\nventilation based on air quality rather than the amount of horsepower\ngenerated by underground vehicles, Dubreuil said. But the change will\nactually be a good thing, since companies can ventilate on demand,\nsaving on energy consumption and, ultimately, cost.\n\nDubreuil said it's an exciting time\nfor BESTECH, as it's able to evolve its technology to\nsimultaneously bring it in line with the client's needs and the\nlegislative requirements.\n\n\"Having these emitters put in\ntechnology that is continually reducing the emissions and going and\nchanging the landscape is fantastic,\" he said. \"I think we're\nquite lucky in Sudbury to have such responsible companies.\""}
{"text":"Policy Measures\n\nReview and assessment of air quality, particularly in urban areas is a necessary first step towards the management of air quality. Air quality management is important to make sure that the air quality objectives are achieved. If the competent authority finds any places where the objectives are not likely to be achieved, it must declare the area in question as being in need of continued Air Quality Management.\n\nDue to non-compliance with PM10 thresholds, MEPA is in the process of drafting an air quality plan for the Maltese Islands. The Authority launched a public consultation exercisein May 2009. Given that national monitoring data clearly identifies the transport sector as the major contributor to air pollution mainly from exhaust emissions, tyre and break abrasion and the re-suspension of dust that had previously settled on the roads, MEPA in conjunction with Malta Transport Authority (ADT) have launched a draft plan that specifically proposes traffic measures. This document was issued for public consultation in September by the Ministry for Infrastructure, Transport and Communications. This plan will form part of the holistic Air Quality Plan for the Maltese Islands.\n\nThe proposed Air Quality Plan for the Maltese Islands will outline policy measures to address man-made pollution sources, namely in the sectors of transport, power generation, construction and small industry. This document will also include the MEPA\/ADT approved traffic measures and the suggestions it received from the first phase of public consultation.\n\nThe Authority is publishing a summary of the suggestions that were received during the Phase 1 of the public consultation together with the proposed traffic measures that were published at the end of September.\n\nPolicies and measures are not only necessary from the point of view of local air quality, but also in respect of national emissions. The National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive (2001\/81\/EC) sets out national emission ceilings for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and non-methane volatile organic compounds in kilotonnes of pollutant to be achieved by Malta by 2010. The environmental objectives of the NEC Directive are to combat acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone.\n\nThe policies and measures necessary to implement this directive are strongly linked to plans and programmes to reduce air pollution in specific areas, especially where exceedances are recorded."}

{"text":"City\n\nIt has been a great summer for anybody who sells ices on the street, repairs air conditioners, or enjoys a run through a park sprinkler. For New Yorkers who sweat their way through the hot days, though, it's been struggle since the start of spring. That is because, this year, New Yorkers have lived through the hottest spring and summer on record. From March to June, we saw four consecutive months that broke their all-time record for average monthly temperature, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nAnd July came close, only avoiding the mark thanks to an unseasonably cool final day that dropped the average monthly temperature in the city to 81.3 degrees, just one-tenth of a degree cooler than July 1999, the reigning hottest July on record.\n\nWeather reporters tend to focus on the temperature readings, but hot weather also brings spikes in levels of ground-level ozone, more commonly referred to as smog. That's because ground-level ozone forms when volatile organic compounds (mostly hydrocarbons) and nitrogen oxide gases mix in sunlight. When there is more sunlight and temperatures rise higher and higher, the ozone reaction speeds up, creating more and more ozone. (By the way, ground-level ozone is different than stratospheric ozone, which helps shield the Earth from dangerous sun ultraviolet rays).\n\nUnhealthy Air\n\nBreathing too much ozone can trigger or worsen a wide range of serious health problems in the short term, including asthma emergencies, bronchitis and emphysema. For some people, inhaling high levels of ozone can lead to chest pain, wheezing, throat irritation, and congestion. Over the longer term, repeatedly breathing the levels of smog we have in New York City can reduce lung function and permanently scar lung tissue.\n\nChildren, the elderly, people with lung disease and people who work or exercise outdoors are all at greater risk than the general population.\n\nNew York City has never met the federal health standards for ground-level ozone. These standards are set periodically by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and are designed to protect both public health and public welfare (crops and vegetation, for example). The federal government sets two ozone standards -- the \"one-hour\" standard is designed to protect people from short-term spikes in ozone levels, and the \"eight-hour\" standard is intended to protect us from more chronic exposure to ozone.\n\nCertainly, cars, trucks and industrial pollution sources are cleaner than they were 40 years ago when the first Clean Air Act was passed. But as our understanding of the health impacts of ozone has increased, the health standards set by the U.S. EPA have become more stringent.\n\nThe agency's AirNow website includes a public awareness program that informs the public about pollution levels in real time and provides daily forecasts of expected pollution levels and historic information about past pollution levels. On the website, the EPA index system rates ozone -- and particulate matter as well -- from a scale of 1 to 500. An Air Quality Index value of 100 generally corresponds to the national health standard for the pollutant. An Air Quality Index rating of 50 is considered to be \"good\" air quality that has little potential to affect public health. At 300, the agency considers the air to be \"hazardous\" to breathe -- so polluted that everybody is at risk and serious enough to trigger public warnings about emergency conditions. In other words, when the Air Quality Index is below 100, EPA believes that the air is generally clean enough for all New Yorkers.\n\nEPA declares an Air Quality Alert day whenever Air Quality Index levels of ozone or particulate pollution exceed 100. When the Air Quality Index is between 101 and 150, EPA considers the air to be \"unhealthy for sensitive groups.\" Although the health of the general public is not expected to be affected in this range, people with lung disease, older adults and children are at a greater risk from exposure to ozone, while particulates in the air pose a greater hazard to persons with heart and lung disease, older adults and children. People in these risk categories are advised to avoid prolonged outdoor exertion when the index is above 100.\n\nThanks to this summer's repeated heat waves, the number of Air Quality Alert days has skyrocketed in 2010. Indeed, according to EPA, there have been 27 Air Quality Alert days since Memorial Day. All but one of these Air Quality Alert days were in the 101 to 150 Air Quality Index range. On July 6, however, portions of the city moved into the red zone of \"unhealthy\" as everybody could begin to feel some adverse effects of the high air pollution. In a normal year, there are fewer than five Air Quality Alert days in the city during May, June and July.\n\nAs Michael Seilback of the American Lung Association in New York said, \"For the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who suffer from asthma and other lung disease, these high levels of ozone could make it difficult to breathe and could even lead to hospitalizations or death.\"\n\nCleaning Up Summer\n\nNew Yorkers who are concerned about the potential health impacts of breathing high levels of ground-level ozone should avoid prolonged outdoor exertions when the heat and pollution levels are high.\n\nIt is easy for concerned New Yorkers to keep up to date with the air pollution levels and forecasts in their community. By subscribing to EnviroFlash, New Yorkers can get a free daily email with up-to-date pollution information for their ZIP code. Calling the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's air quality hotline at 800 535-1345 also will provide localized air quality information.\n\nOn Air Quality Alert days, New Yorkers can help reduce the city's pollution levels by avoiding unnecessary car trips, using transit and reducing electricity consumption wherever possible.\n\nHot summer days are also a good time to remind ourselves of the policy steps that our elected leaders and government officials can take to reduce summertime ozone levels in years to come. In Washington, EPA is expected to announce its new national eight-hour standard for ozone by the end of August. The agency is considering a range of ozone levels below the current standard, and setting the most stringent standard will be especially important. That is because the new standard will trigger revised state-level requirements to develop additional programs to reduce pollution levels to meet the new standard.\n\nIf we are ever to escape from the trends of ever-hotter and more-polluted summers, it will be critical for Washington to take positive action on these necessary policy steps, and for New York to adopt a plan to finally meet EPA's health standards for ozone, once and for all.\n\nRich Kassel is a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, where he focuses on urban air pollution and transportation issues.

{"text":"Propane and the Environment\n\nPropane is an environmentally friendly fuel. It is an approved, alternative clean fuel listed in the 1990 Clean Air Act as well as in the National Energy Policy Act of 1992. Propane is one of the lightest, simplest hydrocarbons in existence, and as a result Is one of the cleanest burning of all alternative fuels.\n\nNew propane-fueled vehicles can meet the very tough Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle {ULEV) standards, and one model even meets the Super Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle {SULEV} standards.\n\nBurning coal to generate electricity releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Per pound of fuel burned, coal emits more than twice the amount of carbon dioxide as propane does. By using propane gas Instead of electricity, consumers can cut emissions and help preserve the environment.\n\nPropane gas is nontoxic, so it's not harmful to soil and water. Because propane does not endanger the environment, the placement of propane tanks either above or below ground is not regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency {EPA). According to the EPA, much of the sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, which produces acid rain is attributable to coal-fired, electricity-generating facilities. In contrast, neither the process by which propane is produced nor the combustion of propane gas produces significant acid rain contaminants.\n\nPropane is one of the cleanest burning fuels, and it doesn't strain the electric grid, so it reduces the risk of power outages.\n\nBreathing propane gas is not harmful to humans. The sulfur odor is added for leak detection."}
{"text":"Home\n\nA home is supposed to be somewhere we go to feel cosy and looked after, and spending time there is meant to be a joy. At the end of a hard day at work, if you aren't looking forward to heading back home and putting the kettle on then something is very much wrong.\n\nAt the same time of course our home is supposed to be somewhere healthy, and it's one of our basic needs for survival to have 'shelter' that can keep us hidden from harsh weather and other dangers. But this is something that not everyone can say with confidence \u2013 and for some of us home can actually be quite unhealthy and even unhygienic. Let's look then at how this could be, and how you can go about combating the problem.\n\nCold\n\nIf your home is very cold a lot of the time then of course this isn't going to be good for you When we are very cold our immune system needs to fight to keep us warm and that means that we use up a lot of energy and aren't as easily able to fend off other assaults on our system caused by bacteria etc. and are thus more likely to become ill. When it's cold we also often end up not sleeping as well and this of course compounds that effect making us even more unlikely to get sick.\n\nAir\n\nIf your air isn't clean then of course this isn't going to be overly good for your health and there are many reasons it might not be. One of the most common reasons for air being difficult to breathe is of course that it is full of dust and that's one of the reasons it's so important to make sure that you dust and vacuum often \u2013 it's not just about the look of your home, but also your hygiene.\n\nLikewise you also need to think about mould which can often cause problems for your breathing. Mould releases 'spores' into the air and these can then cause damage by making it harder for us to breath and drying out our skin \u2013 they can exacerbate and even cause eczema or asthma.\n\nFinally it's also important to ensure that your air has the right moisture levels \u2013 not only to avoid mould building up but also to ensure it is optimum for easy breathing. If your air is too dry this can cause just as much of a problem.\n\nBacteria\n\nOf course if you aren't cleaning your surfaces and floor regularly then this can lead to a build up of bacteria that again can cause a number of illnesses whether that's an infection or a cold or flu. Use antibacterial sprays and wipes regularly and avoid touching your face after touching door knobs or surfaces.\n\nToxins\n\nFinally your building itself could also be poisoning you if it's very old and this could be true if you have lead pipes for instance, or if you have asbestos in your roofing. If you have the latter then asbestos roof replacement is advised to avoid it causing an illness over the long term.\n\nMichelle Quad is a well known blogger. She mostly writes article on health care and about the things that affect our day-to-day life.\n\nIs it possible to imagine a home that is devoid of electrical appliances? TV sets, CD and DVD players, home cinema, telephones etc have become almost indispensable and integral part of our lives. These electrical appliances require different tools for repair, maintenance and other tasks.\n\nSome of the common tools required for the maintenance of the electrical devices are \u2013\n\nVoltage tester: This is a tester that determines whether a contact is live or not.\n\nContinuity tester: This tester determines the amount of electricity a particular electrical component is carrying.\n\nVOM: VOM or Volt-Ohm-Millimeter helps to determine whether a circuit is live and how much electricity it is carrying.\n\nCompressed air: If there is any loose particle or grime in an electrical contact they are immediately cleared with compressed air tools.\n\nAlso, tools like \u2013 Lineman's pliers, long nose pliers, multi meter, neon voltage tester, screw drivers, wire stripper and so on, come in handy. Electrical devices come with a lot of wires. Sometimes these wires need to be connected with each other. One can do it by either twisting the wires with hand and then connecting them or using electrical wire connectors.\n\nElectrical wire connectors include circular, twisted, and a host of other systems. The connectors besides joining wires also reduce the fluctuations that result from electronic vibrations, thereby ensuring the stability of the electrical devices at all times. Wire connectors come as a major improvement over the manual method of combining multiple wires. In addition, you can also use the connectors to fix your wires to certain, pre-determined physical locations, including screws and electronic belts. Users can also have greater control over the connectivity features, and can switch on or switch off connections as per their precise requirements.\n\nWire connectors are available in varying sizes and dimensions, providing users with greater flexibility while choosing the right devices for their electronic applications. Different color schemes are used on the wires, in order to effectively indicate the right category to which it belongs. Most of the wire connectors that are currently available also have advanced insulation\n\nAn electrician is a busy person who might be wiring in an electric shower one day. On another day, he could be adding lighting points in an office ceiling or providing repairs to the wiring in a National Trust building. His jobs include installation, maintenance, fixing and testing. You could find him in a commercial setting, nursing home, hospital, or a residence.\n\nWhat You Get for Free\n\nBefore hiring a professional, find out if there is any troubleshooting you can do from home. As competitive as these firms are, many provide free advice online for solving minor problems. If it is safe to do so, perhaps perform a bit of maintenance before calling out an electrician.\n\nQuotes should also be free. Do not expect any electrician to charge for a visit and to provide an estimate of the cost of wiring an addition to your home or business.\n\nTypes of Work\n\nElectricians work inside and outside, adding lighting for ornamental purposes in your garden, around your pool, or along your driveway. They put in safety lights, or simply provide outdoor sockets so you can plug in Christmas bulbs in December. Another outdoor installation is that of signage, such as commercial signs and EXIT signs.\n\nIndoor work includes changing old, unsafe wiring, adding sockets and outlets for computers, telephones, and televisions, and installing burglar and\/or fire alarm systems. They change lighting fixtures so you can switch from regular bulbs to LED. Make changes to a room and give it a more modern feel with new strip lighting or bring more lighting into a dark space.\n\nElectric heating is another one of the many systems an electrician will install. Relying on a professional for installation and repairs is great, but it is even better to have systems checked on a regular basis to ensure that everything is working efficiently and that a fire threat is not hidden somewhere in your home or office.\n\nThe 24\/7 Promise\n\nA number of large firms guarantee that if you have a problem late at night or in the wee hours of the morning, they can get a professional to your door at any time within the hour. These 24\/7 professionals are very handy to have around when an alarm system malfunctions and is waking up the neighbours, or if heating suddenly dies in the middle of a cold January night. An electrician in London will charge more for the privilege of hiring him at 2 am, but his willingness and promptness make the extra fees worthwhile.\n\nElectrician Chris Thomas walked into a shop with two screwdrivers in his pocket and sparked a drastic response \u2013 he was tasered by armed police. Mr Thomas was taken to court over the security scare, which he described as \"a ridiculous waste of tax \u2026\n\nIt's well known that the first impression is very important and doors and windows generally give your visitors an idea of what's inside the house. Therefore, doors and windows should not only be a way of protecting your property from burglars and keep your house safe. Their role has considerably evolved as they are now used to give personality to your property. And there are many companies up and down the country that can design and install doors and windows according to your tastes.\n\nThere's a great variety of doors and windows in the market so wave goodbye to those dull doors and get some that can boost the beauty of your home. For instance if you live in a Victorian house you can change your doors for modern doors while keeping the Victorian theme.\n\nAnd if you live in a modern house with a garden then you can opt for some lovely double glazing to give more value to your garden. In addition, double glazing will let more light into your house making it more welcoming and warm.\n\n1. Maintaining your Garden\n\nThe garden is part of your house so you shouldn't neglect it, no matter the season make sure that your garden is clean and well maintained. In fact, in winter people tend to leave garbage in the garden as they don't spend that much time there anymore. But that's an \" aesthetic\" mistake because you can still match the decoration of your interior with your garden. For instance if there's snow in the garden you can put some decorating items in your living-room reminiscent of winter and snow.\n\n2. How to Decorate your Interiors\n\nAfter installing the double glazing you can add some green items in your living room and that will create a connexion between your garden and your living-room. If you don't have a garden you can still add colours to your interior using frames, flowers, and furniture. In fact, you can for instance buy red, green or purple sofas instead of buying cold colours like black or grey. Nowadays colours and animal printings are fashionable and they give life to your interior so put some more colour in your interior and it will immediately change it into a welcoming and warm place.\n\n3. How to Keep your Fridge Clean and Fresh\n\nIt's really important to keep your house clean and that also include your refrigerator. In fact, having a dirty refrigerator can give a bad impression to your visitors. You can avoid having a dirty fridge by putting all your leftovers in plastic boxes before putting them in the fridge. And you can freshen your refrigerator by chopping a lime into two parts and then put them in the refrigerator and the lime will absorb all the smells.\n\n4. How to Clean your Carpets\n\nIt's also really important to have clean carpets, especially if you have kids, and animals. In fact if you have a cat or a dog you don't want your visitors to find hairs everywhere in the house, and if you have kids you have to make sure that you have carpet cleaning solutions that will help you not only clean your carpets but also get rid of germs, so that your baby can crawl on a germ free surface.\n\nIf you have recently constructed a swimming pool at your home, you have to learn something about pool service and maintenance. First of all, you should know that your swimming pool requires regular maintenance and care. But pool maintenance is not an easy task. Even if your pool does not occupy much space, cleaning up your pool could turn out to be a daunting task \u2013 if you dare to do it on your own. Likewise, even if you are fortunate enough to employ household help, you have to understand that pool maintenance shouldn't be done by your unskilled housekeeper or worker. Only people with proper training and experience would be able to perform a perfect pool cleaning task.\n\nObviously, you have to get hold of a professionally trained person for your pool service. Such a person will be able to assess the chemical levels in your pool. He will have adequate knowledge in pool repair and upkeep. So he would be able to spot the unnoticed problems in your pool. A well-trained pool service professional will be able to detect a hidden fault and he would suggest appropriate measures for fixing that defect without difficulty.\n\nThis will also save you so much money that would otherwise be wasted on repairing or rebuilding your pool, due to undetected defects that increase in complexity with the passage of time. So, if you are thinking that professional pool service is a waste of money till now, it's time to change your opinion for good. Besides, think of the mess you would get into if you try to clean your pool by yourself. Surely, you built your swimming pool for your recreation and not for doing extra heavy work! So, why waste your precious weekends and holidays in maintaining your pool? Instead of fretting over your pool, try to save your energy and time by hiring a professional to do the swimming pool service.\n\nIn general, the experienced pool service specialists know everything about swimming pools and they can restore your pool and its equipment to its original state within a short period of time. But if you try to do the swimming pool maintenance on your own, this task could last for hours and it would tire you out at the end of the day. Even then, you will not be able to achieve the results accomplished by a professional service person due to lack of knowledge and experience. Why, you may even end up damaging your swimming pool gear or you could stain the beautiful surface of your pool permanently. So, instead of taking risks and ruining your day at the end, try to gain some peace of mind by shifting the responsibility of servicing your pool to an expert who is willing to do the work.\n\nIn fact, there are many such professionals who are willing to do the pool service for you in exchange for a reasonable fee. But, you should not make the mistake of hiring any professional or company without verifying their background. Check whether the service company has proper certifications, experience, cleaning equipment, manpower, etc. In case you want to sign an attractive contract that saves you some money, do it only after evaluating the technician's performance. Remember, hiring a qualified technician for servicing your pool is a wonderful idea. But it would be a blunder if you hire someone who lacks proper training, skills, cleaning equipment, etc. So try to hire a professional pool service only after verifying their credentials.\n\n1 comment - What do you think?\nPosted by admin -\nJune 30, 2012 at 6:25 am\n\nBuilding your home is a serious and important task, and you need the help of home builders to get it done accurately and with high regard to safety. There are many important considerations when choosing home builders to work for you to ensure that you get quality results from their services.\n\nWork on a home building plan\n\nThe home is one of the important assets people pay for. It provides them a comfortable and safe place to live. One of the most important factors to be considered when you are planning to hire home builders is to start with a home building plan. You need not make a technical description for the plan but you need to have a good picture of your home design and specifications before you start looking for home builders. Discuss your home building plan to various home builders and ask them how they can help improve it. You can base your decision according to who gives better and creative ideas on improving your home construction plan.\n\nLook for Professional Qualifications\n\nIt is important to review the qualifications of the home builder firm that you will choose to hire. There are many home builder firms that you can find that offer variety of services. You can base your hiring decisions according to their expertise and portfolio. It is best to ask for the firm's history and samples of their home construction projects. You can also assess their business profile and review the professional skills of their employees. Because you cannot afford to make a costly mistake when building your home, it is best to ask help from professional home builders who can guarantee you high standard of services.\n\nDetermine your budget\n\nHome construction can be a very expensive project to undertake. Make sure that you have a target budget for this undertaking. If you are getting a home building loan, you need to include in your plan the expenses to be covered in the project including the materials, labor fees and professional services you will need. Home builders offer flexible services that allow them to accommodate clients with a different budget range of home building projects. It is best to discuss with your potential home builder prospects to hire about their different service rates and the services covered. Try to compare their rates and services to determine which will give you better value for your money.\n\nDetermine the specific services you need\n\nHome builders provide a wide range of professional services. They can obtain the building license permit and providing assistance in the laying out of the construction plan. They have can provide detailed planning for your home building while their services can be limited to supervising individual contractors to perform their tasks diligently, efficiently and with quality output. You can also choose to hire them as a land surveyor to ensure that your home is constructed on a solid and safe foundation. They can supervise the over-all performance of your contractors and to generally manage the stake out of the construction location. While it will cost you higher fees when you want the home builder firm to provide you more services, it is wiser to cut down the cost of being selective in the professional services you want to pay for.\n\nThe hiring of home builders is an important decision to make. You need to consider important factors that could affect the quality of your decision making when hiring for home builders to work for you.\n\nThere's nothing better than climbing into a lovely, cosy bed at the end of a hard day. Your dog probably feels much the same. After loads of running about in the fresh air and a delicious bedtime snack, a comfortable bed is the ultimate in doggy happiness!\n\nThese days indoor dog beds are much more common than outdoor kennels. Very few of us still put the cat or dog out at night, even though they're naturally evolved to cope with the cold. Today's pooches and pussies sleep in luxury. There's gorgeously fluffy, washable doggie beds lined with faux fur. There's stain-proof fabric versions for dogs of all sizes, from the charming little Chug, a cross between a Chihuahua and a Pug and smaller than your average cat, to Great Danes and Alsatians.\n\nA soft place to sleep is particularly nice for older dogs. Like us they suffer from aches and pains and a good night's sleep is worth it's weight in gold for a happy doggy life.\n\nThere are a number of rooms inside a house which come with light fixtures already installed when people purchase the home. Most of these are ceiling lights, which are placed in the main living areas. These lights are found in the kitchen as well as in all of the bedrooms. Even though bedrooms come with this type of light fixture already installed, people usually purchase their own type of home lighting products to use in their bedrooms. These products are usually table lamps designed for use with the types of end tables or nightstands people place next to their beds.\n\nThe home lighting products created as table lamps, are usually added to the bedroom to provide a softer light than what the overhead ceiling item provides. These table top lamps can be used for reading or watching TV. People also like to add these lamps because they come in a lot of different styles that make them accent pieces. Generally, these lamps are smaller in statue than the table lamps used in social gathering spaces such as the living room. The various styles available for the bedroom can be made of glass, ceramic or wood using different styles of shades.\n\nThere are also home lighting fixtures available for use with the headboards of a bed frame. Some of these are designed to attach to the headboard, while others can be built into it. These lights serve the same purpose as the table lamp, but usually come with the ability to swivel so the light can be focused on a particular area. Another type of lighting are the multilevel lights found on dressing or makeup mirrors. These mirrors are used in combination with a bedroom vanity and are designed specifically to replicate the type of natural light found during different times of the day.\n\nWhen it comes to the lighting people use in their homes, there are some instances when they choose to use non-traditional items to create special effects. When someone is going to have a formal dinner party, the lighting used in the room is often enhanced with the use of lighted candles on the table. Depending on how many candles are used, they could be the only source of light in the room if the host wants to create a soft subdued effect. This same effect can be accomplished if the homeowner has a light fixture that works with a control used for dimming the amount of light given off by the bulb.\n\nInterior lighting also changes when people celebrate certain holidays. During the winter months people like to add more festivity to their rooms by placing various string lights around stair banisters and window sills. These lights are also used to decorate trees used inside the home for celebrating the Christmas holiday season. This type of festive lighting is usually kept in place for about two weeks to allow people to visit with friends and family in a joyful setting.\n\nHoliday lighting can also include table lights designed to look like various characters. These items are usually made of hard plastic with a hole placed either in the back or the bottom, for the insertion of a bulb. These character lights provide a soft glow and can be used as the only light in the room to create a special effect. Soft lighting can also be used to create a romantic atmosphere, which is usually achieved through the use of candlelight or the flame flickering inside an oil lamp. Oil lamps are also known as hurricane lamps and can be purchased in a variety of decorative styles designed to hold lamp oil inside the base.\n\nCeramic tile floors are a wonderful option for kitchens and bathrooms. Those living on the beach may even choose to put tile throughout their home. However, it's important that you know how to properly care for tile flooring or you could risk having a floor that is slippery and dangerous. Here's everything you need to know about how to care for ceramic tile flooring.\n\nSweep or Vacuum to Remove Dust and Dirt\n\nDepending on the traffic through the area, you may want to sweep or vacuum daily. However, in most cases, a weekly sweeping will do just fine. If you do choose to vacuum the floor instead of sweeping, be sure to set the vacuum to the bare floor setting so that you don't ruin your floors.\n\nClean with Tile and Grout Cleaner\n\nEach tile and grout cleaner is different so you'll want to follow the directions listed on the package to mix the cleaner with water. Once mixed, apply the cleaner to the floor and allow the cleaner to stay on the floor for 3 to 5 minutes. Then agitate the cleaner with a sponge or mop and then mop up the cleaner. You will need to rinse the mop and change the cleaning solution for every 500 square feet.\n\nRinse the Floor with Clean Water\n\nNext, you'll want to rinse the floor with clean water so that you're sure to remove all the cleaning solution. If the cleaning solution builds up, and doesn't get rinsed away, it can become dangerous, especially in bathrooms and other areas where water may come in contact with the dried cleaner.\n\nRemove Excess Moisture\n\nOnce the floor is thoroughly rinsed, you will need to clean up the excess water with a dry mop or wet vac. This will help ensure that you don't have water spots on the floor and that someone doesn't come through and slip.\n\nWipe Dry\n\nLast, but not least, go over the floor one more time to wipe it dry. The dry mop and wet vac will take up any puddles of water, but you'll want to go over it once more with a dry rag style mop to get it nice and dry.\n\nCeramic tile flooring is a great option is any home where you don't want to fool with the fuss of cleaning a carpet or maintaining a hardwood floor. However, there is some cleaning involved and this cleaning is important because ceramic tile flooring can become slippery from grease and dirt build up. Thankfully, the steps are easy and most homes will only require a monthly cleaning to ensure the floors remain clean and safe.\n\nAbout the Author: Dane Hollenshead specializes in flooring installation and enjoys working with both ceramic and porcelain tile. He feels they lend a classic feel to many rooms \u2013 especially bathroom and kitchen environments!"}
{"text":"Acid Rain: Downpour in Asia?\n\nOverview\n\nAlthough there has been major progress in controlling acid-forming emissions in some countries, the global threat from acid rain is far from over yet. In fact, the dimensions of the acid rain problem are growing rapidly in Asia, with sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions expected to as much as triple from 1990 levels by 2010 if current trends continue. Curtailing the already substantial acid rain damage in Asia and avoiding much heavier damages in the future will require investments in pollution control on the order of those made in Europe and North America over the past 20 years [1].\n\nEven in developed countries where there have been serious efforts to control acid rain, the story is more complicated than it once appeared. Questions remain in regards to how much damage has been done to forests, lakes, and streams over the years; whether current progress is sufficient to protect the most vulnerable ecosystems; and how soon acid-damaged areas will recover.\n\nAcid rain emerged as a concern in the 1960s with observations of dying lakes and forest damage in northern Europe, the United States, and Canada. It was one of the first environmental issues to demonstrate a large-scale regional scope, with the chief pollutants \u2013 oxides of sulfur (SOx) and nitrogen (NOx) from combustion of fossil fuels \u2013 able to be carried hundreds of miles by winds before being washed out of the atmosphere in rain, fog, and snow.\n\nAs evidence grew of the links between air pollution and environmental damage, legislation to curb emissions was put in place. The 1979 Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and its subsequent amendments set targets for reductions of sulfur and nitrogen emissions in Europe that have largely been achieved. The 1970 and 1990 Clean Air Acts have led to similar improvements in the United States.\n\nScientific uncertainties about acid rain persist, however. In the case of forest damage, the contribution of acid rain is hard to isolate from other stresses such as drought, fire, and pests that figure heavily in forest health. In Canada, for example, losses to fires and insects exceed the volume of timber harvested for industrial use [2]. For this reason, the contribution of air pollution to forest damage is a controversial subject, particularly in North America. The most recent and authoritative assessment of forest conditions in Europe reports that 25 percent of trees sampled in more than 30 countries were rated as damaged (having lost more than 25 percent of their leaves). Damage has been increasing over the past 20 years and, while the report notes the difficulty of identifying definitive causes, nearly one half of the countries participating in the survey mentioned air pollution as a cause [3].\n\nAcid rain is now emerging as a major problem in the developing world, especially in parts of Asia and the Pacific region where energy use has surged and the use of sulfur-containing coal and oil \u2013 the primary sources of acid emissions \u2013 is very high. An estimated 34 million metric tons of SO2 were emitted in the\nAsia region in 1990, over 40 percent more than in North America [4] [5]. Acid deposition levels were particularly high in areas such as southeast China, northeast India, Thailand, and the Republic of Korea, which are near or downwind from major urban and industrial centers. The effects are already being felt in the agriculture sector. Researchers in India found that wheat growing near a power plant where SO2 deposition was almost five times greater than the critical load (the amount the soil can safely absorb without harm) suffered a 49-percent reduction in yield compared with wheat\ngrowing 22 kilometers away [6]. In southwestern China, astudy in Guizhou and Sichuan provinces revealed that acid rain fell on some two thirds of the agricultural lands, with 16 percent of the crop area sustaining some level of damage. Other ecosystems are also beginning to suffer. A study of pines and oaks in acid rain-affected areas of the Republic of Korea, both rural and urban, showed significant declines in growth rates since 1970 [7].\n\nSO2 Emissions in Asia Could Triple\n\nPast and Projected Sulfur Dioxide Emissions for Asia, Europe, and the United States and Canada\n\n5.

{"text":"Environmental exposures in infancy linked to early asthma\n\nSEATTLE (May 20)-Day-to-day exposure to certain chemicals, pollutants and other environmental factors during the first year of life appears to raise children's risk of developing asthma, according to a study released today from the Keck School of Medicine of USC.\n\nFrank D. Gilliland, M.D., Ph.D., professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School, presented findings from the Children's Health Study at the 99th Annual International Conference of the American Thoracic Society.\n\nGilliland and colleagues found that exposures to cockroaches, weed killers, pesticides, fuel oil, soot, exhaust and farm crops, dust and animals beginning in the first year of life were all linked to early asthma, while babies who first attended daycare before 4 months of age also were more likely to be diagnosed with the respiratory disease later on.\n\n\"The first year of life seems uniquely important in terms of susceptibility to environmental triggers of asthma,\" Gilliland says.\n\nThe research team conducted the case-control study within a large subset of children participating in the ongoing Children's Health Study. Researchers with the USC-led Children's Health Study have monitored levels of major pollutants in a dozen Southern California communities since 1993, while carefully following the respiratory health of more than 3,000 students.\n\nThe researchers looked at 338 children who were diagnosed with asthma by a physician before they turned 5 years old. They then matched those children to 570 asthma-free children of the same age who lived in the same communities. They also matched them according to whether the children had been exposed to maternal smoking while still in the womb.\n\nThey found that the risk of developing asthma before age 5 rose significantly with these exposures (figures given in odds ratios):\n\nWood or oil smoke, soot or exhaust anytime between birth and age 5: More than 50 percent (1.57)\n\nThe study was not designed to find out specifically why risk increased. In general, Gilliland notes: \"The first year of life is a critical time period of lung development-both for immunity and airway structure. Others have shown that certain early life exposures are important for asthma development.\"\n\nIn the case of daycare attendance, Gilliland theorizes that early and frequent exposure to respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, in a daycare setting might raise early asthma risk.\n\nThe research team found that the more older brothers and sisters a child had at birth, the lower the child's risk of early asthma. But they found nothing to indicate that other early childhood experiences such as exclusive breast-feeding or exposure to cats, dogs or other pets protect against early asthma.\n\nMore research is needed to determine what levels of exposure may be important and whether reducing exposures reduces asthma risk.\n\nAsthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting about one in 14 children in the United States, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, or NHLBI, one of the groups sponsoring the research. The California Air Resources Board, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and Environmental Protection Agency also sponsored the study."}

{"text":"Air pollution is defined as the contamination of the air by tiny particles, or particulates, of solids and liquids and noxious gases in unhealthy amounts. It refers to the chemical and biological agents that modify the atmosphere, usually in perilous ways. Some of its major sources are automobile engines, industrial practices, heat and energy production, and the burning of solid waste. When inhaled, air pollutants affect the respiratory tract and lungs, but may also travel through the bloodstream and distress vital organs. By depositing themselves in the environment, these chemicals may also contaminate food and water, and they harm plants and animals alike. No one is safe from air pollution, and even your own home is full of airborne contaminants.\n\nFirst, one naturally formed pollutant is carbon monoxide, a gas that is poisonous to humans. Unfortunately, it is tasteless, colorless, and odorless, so it cannot be detected by the senses. Carbon monoxide's natural atmospheric concentration is about 0.2 ppm, or parts per million, which is not harmful to humans. Some of its natural sources are bushfires and volcanic eruptions; however, it is also formed by humans. The main indoor source of carbon monoxide is tobacco smoking, and the main outdoor source is vehicle exhaust and some industrial activities, like creating steel. Sydney, Australia's main source of this is automobiles; 91% of emissions are due to their combined exhaust.\n\nThere is significant reason why smoking is discouraged in pregnant women, those with heart trouble, and even the healthy. First, carbon monoxide affects humans by taking up hemoglobin's carrying space. This would otherwise be occupied by oxygen, and impairs vital organs by giving them less oxygen than is necessary. Also, a mere 2.5% or more affected hemoglobin will noticeably affect your health, and 40% will almost surely kill any human.

{"text":"How It Affects Your Health\n\nIt's a fair bet that global warming is going to lead to a rise in human sickness and death. But what form they will take is difficult to say. We can be pretty sure that as average temperatures climb, there will be more frequent and longer heat waves of the sort that contributed to the death of at least 20,000 Europeans in August 2003. Other predictions are more tenuous. For example, rising temperatures could--if rainfall and other conditions are right--result in larger mosquito populations at higher elevations in the tropics, which could in turn contribute to the spread of malaria, dengue and other insect-borne infections. Early indications are not encouraging. The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that even the modest increases in average temperature that have occurred since the 1970s have begun to take a toll. Climate change is responsible for at least 150,000 extra deaths a year--a figure that will double by 2030, according to WHO's conservative estimate. As with so many public-health issues, a disproportionate part of the burden appears to be falling on the poorest of the poor. That doesn't mean, however, that the comparatively wealthy--who account for more than their share of greenhouse-gas emissions--will escape harm.\n\nA look at three key factors affected by warming offers a hint of things to come.\n\nAIR We're used to thinking of industrial and traffic pollution as having a detrimental effect on air quality. But all other things being equal, rising temperature by itself increases the amount of ground-level ozone, a major constituent of smog. So many studies have linked higher ozone levels to death rates from heart and lung ailments that many cities issue smog alerts to warn those at risk to stay indoors. You can expect more and longer alerts.\n\nIt gets worse. Higher levels of carbon dioxide favor the growth of ragweed and other pollen producers over other plants, according to Dr. Paul Epstein at Harvard's Center for Health and the Global Environment. In addition, ragweed churns out more pollen as CO2 levels rise. Scientists have tied local spikes in asthma and allergy attacks to increases in molds and emissions from diesel engines. Apparently, the molds attach themselves to diesel particles, which deliver them more efficiently deep into the lungs. Add a plentiful helping of dust storms (from, for instance, the desertification of Mongolia or northern Africa) and a rise in drought-driven brushfires, and you have a made- to-order recipe for increasing respiratory distress worldwide.\n\nWATER Residents of the U.S. Gulf Coast don't have to be reminded that water can be a killer. You can usually evacuate people ahead of a major storm, but you can't evacuate infrastructure. \"Thirteen of the 20 largest cities in the world happen to be located at sea level,\" says Dr. Cindy Parker of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore, Md. That means that where people are most at risk from floods, so are hospitals and water-treatment plants. As we have seen in New Orleans, the health effects of losing those facilities persist long after the water has receded."}
{"text":"McMaster launches landmark study on long-term impact of air pollution on health\n\nOver 25 years ago, a McMaster researcher began a groundbreaking study to measure air quality and respiratory health of children in Hamilton. Now, the next generation of researchers at McMaster is taking the unprecedented step to contact those children in an attempt to understand the long-term effects of air pollution.\n\n\"We're trying to understand how exposure to air pollution as children impacts their health as young adults,\" explains Susan Elliott, a professor in the School of Geography & Earth Sciences.\n\nElliott is following up on the work of David Pengelly, now a retired professor of respirology. Between 1979 and 1986, Pengelly, with the assistance of colleagues Tony Kerigan and Charlie Goldsmith, took comprehensive air quality readings at more than 20 locations within the former boundaries of the City of Hamilton. At the same time, he studied the respiratory health of 3,500 Hamilton children. His analysis revealed that higher pollution levels had a short-term effect on the respiratory health of children with asthma.\n\nElliott is hoping that people who participated in the original study as children will participate in this new study group. \"People in Hamilton are very interested in issues of air quality and health. Using Yellow.ca and Canada 411, which are electronic forms of the phonebook found on the World Wide Web, we were able this summer to send letters to parents of 1,500 children who participated in the study. We are already getting surveys back and the response has been tremendously positive. We're hoping that through the media, we will be able to get in contact with more children we haven't been able to reach.\"\n\nThe McMaster study is the first time any research group has tried to reconnect with study participants in this way.\n\nPeople who believe they may have participated in the study are asked to contact Michelle Vine, research associate on the project, at 905-525-9140 ext. 23139 or vinemm@mcmaster.ca or Susan Elliott at 905-525-9140 ext. 23768 or elliotts@mcmaster.ca."}
{"text":"Radon: Is it a problem\n\nDescription\/Abstract\n\nRadon gas is a major source of radiation exposure to the general public. Radon-222 is a product of uranium-238, present in varying concentrations in all soils. Radon enters buildings from soil, water, natural gas, and building materials. Its short-lived breakdown products, termed radon daughters, include alpha-emitting solids that can deposit in the lungs. Firm evidence links lung cancer risk in miners with high exposure to radon daughters. The amount of risk associated with the much lower but chronic doses received in buildings is difficult to establish. By some extrapolations, radon daughters may be responsible for a significant number of lung cancer deaths. The existence or extent of synergism with smoking is unresolved. Local conditions can cause high levels of radon in some buildings, and measures that reduce indoor radon are of potential value. 39"}

{"text":"Products\n\nAirSense\n\nAirSense technology allows for constant and consistent readings of the level of potential toxins and other air pollutants of indoor air quality.\n\nIndoor air quality (IAQ) depends on the building usage, applied ventilation solutions, building location, construction methods and materials, and outdoor conditions. Adequate ventilation and healthy structures are prerequisites for good indoor air quality. AirSense offers peace of mind and protection from potential harm, airborne sickness, and other air pollutant induced issues.\n\nHuman comfort, productivity, and a sense of health and well-being are the positive outcome of a healthy indoor environment. Human comfort depends on an interaction of multiple variables. Optimizing both temperature and relative humidity satisfies the comfort requirements for a wider variety of occupants than optimizing only temperature. Carbon dioxide (CO2) level is a surrogate measurement for indoor air quality and human presence.\n\nInnovations in improving and monitoring air quality have allowed for air purification advancements, humidity monitoring, and overall climate control and testing to be examined regularly by simple in building systems. As it is essential to protect your home and overall indoor space from pollutants, better air means better health.\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal poisoning in many industrialized countries. Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odorless and tasteless gas caused by the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels.\n\nCarbon monoxide is a toxic gas to the human body, when inhaled it binds to hemoglobin, myoglobin, and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase reducing oxygen storage, transport and respiration in these organelles.\n\nCommon sources of carbon monoxide are tobacco smoke, space heaters using fossil fuels, defective central heating furnaces and automobile exhaust. Improvements in indoor levels of CO are systematically improving from increasing implementation of smoke-free laws. By depriving the brain of oxygen, high levels of carbon monoxide can lead to nausea, unconsciousness and death. According to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the time-weighted average (TWA) limit for carbon monoxide (630-08-0) is 25 ppm.\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted in a number of ways. It is emitted naturally and through human activities like the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is generated as a by-product of the combustion of fossil fuels or the burning of vegetable matter, among other chemical processes. Small amounts of carbon dioxide are emitted from volcanoes and other geothermal processes.\n\n\n\nCarbon dioxide is colorless. At low concentrations, the gas is odorless. At higher concentrations it has a sharp, acidic odor. Amounts above 5,000 ppm are considered very unhealthy, and those above about 50,000 ppm (equal to 5% by volume) are considered dangerous to animal life.\n\nCarbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow drowsy, get headaches, or function at lower activity levels. Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide. Indoor levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity. To eliminate most Indoor Air Quality complaints, total indoor carbon dioxide should be reduced a difference of less than 600 ppm above outdoor levels. NIOSH considers that indoor air concentrations of carbon dioxide that exceed 1,000 ppm are a marker suggesting inadequate ventilation. ASHRAE recommends that carbon dioxide levels not exceed 700 ppm above outdoor ambient levels. Some standards for schools say that carbon dioxide in all teaching and learning spaces, when measured at seated head height and averaged over the whole day should not exceed 1,500 ppm. The whole day refers to normal school hours (i.e. 9.00am to 3.30pm) and includes unoccupied periods such as lunch breaks. Other standards limit carbon dioxide to 3500 ppm. OSHA limits carbon dioxide concentration in the workplace to 5,000 ppm for prolonged periods, and 35,000 ppm for 15 minutes.\n\nRadon is an invisible, radioactive atomic gas that results from the radioactive decay of radium, which may be found in rock formations beneath buildings or in certain building materials themselves. Radon is probably the most pervasive serious hazard for indoor air in the United States and Europe, probably responsible for tens of thousands of deaths from lung cancer each year. There are relatively simple tests for radon gas, but these tests are not commonly made available, even in areas of known systematic hazards. Radon is a heavy gas and thus will tend to accumulate at the floor level. Building materials can actually be a significant source of radon, but little testing is carried out for stone, rock or tile products brought into building sites; radon accumulation is greatest for well insulated homes. The half life for radon is 3.8 days, indicating that once the source is removed, the hazard will be greatly reduced within a few weeks.\n\nHowever, annually thousands of people go to radon contaminated mines for purposeful exposure to help with the symptoms of arthritis without any serious known health effects, though lung cancer can take many years to develop. Radon mitigation methods include sealing concrete slab floors, basement foundations, water drainage systems, or by increasing ventilation. They are usually cost effective and can greatly reduce or even eliminate the contamination and the associated health risks.Organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishes, and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing, and hobby products. Fuels are made up of organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds during usage, and, to some degree, when they are stored. Testing emissions from building materials used indoors has become increasingly common for floor coverings, paints, and many other important indoor building materials and finishes.\n\nSeveral initiatives envisage to reduce indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from products. There are regulations in France and in Germany, and numerous voluntary ecolabels and rating systems containing low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, M1, Blue Angel and Indoor Air Comfort in Europe, as well as California Standard CDPH Section 01350 and several others in the USA. These initiatives changed the marketplace where an increasing number of low-emitting products has become available during the last decades.\n\nAt least 18 Microbial VOCs (MVOCs) have been characterised including 1-octen-3-ol, 3-methyl furan, 2-pentanol, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone, 3-octanone, 3-octanol, 2-octen-1-ol, 1-octene, 2-pentanone, 2-nonanone, Borneol, Geosmin, 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-2-butanol, and thujopsene. The first of these compounds is called mushroom alcohol. The last four are products of Stachybotryschartarum, which has been linked with sick building syndrome.\n\nFormaldehyde is an important chemical used widely by industry to manufacture building materials and numerous household products. It is also a by-product of combustion and certain other natural processes. Thus, it may be present in substantial concentrations both indoors and outdoors.\n\nSources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, smoking, household products, and the use of un-vented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in manufactured products. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and coating products.\n\nIn homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (used as sub-flooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is generally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.\n\nSampling dust and particulate matter is important as dust and particulate matter can affect the health of human populations, as well as the natural environment. Dust and particulate matter can cause respiratory problems when breathed in by humans. Dust and particulates above 10 micrometer (PM10) are filtered and generally do not enter the lungs.\n\nDust and particulates below PM10 are likely to enter the lungs. Dust and particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) can enter into the Alveoli where gas exchange occurs. This PM2.5 is more dangerous as it can affect the exchange of gases within the lungs and even penetrate the lung into the blood stream and cause other health issues.\n\nThese two size classes (PM10 and PM2.5) are the normal sampling standards found throughout the world, they represent the particulate pollution that effects human health and thus sampling them provides an accurate insight into how dust and particulate matter at both PM10 and PM2.5 effect human health."}

The report uses data from the National Research Council finding that particulate matter (soot) from the State Line coal plant creates about $77 million in health and related damages annually which are imposed on the public. Overall, this coal plant has created between $540 million and $720 million in public health damages and costs since 2002.\n\n\"The State Line coal plant is polluting our air, harming our health and draining our wallets,\" said Howard Learner, Executive Director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center. \"It's time for Dominion Resources to be socially responsible and invest in modern pollution control equipment to clean up this old plant up, or shut it down. Enough is enough.\"\n\nThe State Line coal plant is located on the Illinois\/Indiana border, just 13 miles from downtown Chicago and along the Lake Michigan shoreline. About 78,000 people live within three miles of the plant. This coal plant continues to operate with much equipment built between 1955 and 1962, and Dominion Resources, the plant owner, has not installed modern pollution controls such as scrubbers.\n\nELPC's report, Dominion Resources' \"Unpaid Health Bills\": The Hidden Public Costs of Soot and Smog from the State Line Coal Plant,\" examines recent scientific research on the health effects of soot and smog pollution from coal plants. Numerous authoritative scientific panels have found that particulate matter pollution from coal plants harms public health, causing various health detriments including premature death, heart attacks, and cardiovascular and respiratory disease. The personal hardship and economic impact of these health problems is borne by the public.\n\nThe report adds new information to the debate on how coal plants in Illinois and Indiana should be operated and regulated. U.S. EPA initiated an enforcement action against the State Line coal plant in 2009, citing 4,770 minutes of opacity (\"soot and smoke\") violations between 2004 and 2008. In September 2010, ELPC and other health and environmental groups filed a notice of intent to sue Dominion Resources for repeatedly violating the amount of soot and smoke the plant is allowed to emit under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\"Soot and smog from the State Line coal plant is making us sick and costing us hundreds of millions of dollars,\" said Learner. \"Cleaning them up is the right thing to do for our environment and our economy.\""}

{"text":"Air Quality\n\nEvery year we are required to carry out an assessment of air quality in our district. The Government has laid down a set a of health based standards called Air Quality Objectives for the following seven key pollutants:\n\nbenzene\n\n1,3-butadiene\n\ncarbon monoxide\n\nlead\n\nnitrogen dioxide\n\nparticulates (small particles called pm10)\n\nsulphur dioxide\n\nThe assessment uses a range of screening methods such as the identification of specific pollution sources like busy roads or junctions, certain industrial processes and local pollution monitoring data and considers whether there is a possibility of any of the national Air Quality Objectives being exceeded at, for example, houses (but not workplaces). If this initial screening assessment suggests that there is a risk of a breach of any of these standards we are required to carry out a more in depth study called a Detailed Assessment to obtain more accurate data. This may involve detailed monitoring and pollution modelling.\n\nIf after a Detailed Assessment it is found that there is a breach of any of the Air Quality Objectives we have to declare the affected area (which may be no more than a few houses) as an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA). We have to be very careful to control any additional pollution in an AQMA, usually through the planning system or by imposing tighter emission limits on some types of industrial activities.

A poorly-maintained or malfunctioning vehicle uses up to 20 percent more gasoline and can release as much as 80 times the pollution of a well-maintained vehicle,\" said Ken Lloyd, executive director of the Regional Air Quality Council, the state's air quality planning agency.\n\nThe Maintenance Matters partners were spurred to develop an educational program amid rising fuel costs and the need to reduce harmful ground-level ozone pollution. Because vehicles account for more than 25 percent of all air pollution nationwide an education campaign aimed at vehicle maintenance and its benefits targets the right area; Maintenance Matters addresses air quality for all and savings for individuals.\n\nLocal repair facility owners and technicians have long known the benefits of regular maintenance, and the Denver metro area's emissions inspection and maintenance program encourages it. However, keeping it at the forefront of people's minds has always been a challenge.\n\n\"Unless it's broken, people tend to ignore their vehicle maintenance lights and schedules,\" said Donny Seyfer, owner of Seyfer Automotive and past chairman of the Automotive Service Association of Colorado. \"We want to change that to benefit the car owner and the community as a whole. We know that just basic maintenance goes a long way in savings at the gas pump and for air quality.\"\n\nIn addition to the opportunity to win $300 in maintenance and repairs, motorists can find a coupon good for $25 toward any maintenance related service, including an oil change, at participating auto repair shops. The coupons underscore the relationship between properly maintained vehicles and clean air, and the ultimate cost-savings to drivers. Participating shops can be found on the web site \n\nCoalition partners include Envirotest \u2013 Air Care Colorado, the Regional Air Quality Council, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and several local repair businesses.\n\n###\n\nMay 31 2012\n\nSummer Ozone Season Begins June 1\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nResidents asked to pledge ozone-reducing behavior\n\nDENVER \u2014 May 31, 2012 \u2014 June 1 marks the official start ofozone season in the Denver Metro\/Northern Front Range area. The season will last through the summer months until Aug. 31.\n\nThe Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC) is kicking off the eighth year of its Ozone Aware campaign by asking residents to join its Clean Air Community and pledge certain ozone-reducing behaviors throughout the summer. The RAQC asks citizens to help reduce ozone by taking actions such as driving less, taking transit, and mowing their lawns after 5 p.m. on hot summer days.\n\nGround level ozone pollution forms when emissions from gas-powered vehicles and lawn equipment, industrial and chemical processes, and even household activities react with heat and sunlight. The highest ozone levels usually occur in summer months when temperatures approach the high 80s and 90s and when the wind is stagnant or light. During the 2012 ozone season, the RAQC issued high ozone alerts for 36 out of 92 days.\n\nOzone can trigger attacks and symptoms in people with pre-existing health conditions such as asthma or other respiratory diseases. High levels of ozone pollution may also affect healthy people who work or exercise outdoors; and it can cause breathing difficulties, eye irritation and reduced resistance to lung infections and colds with exposure for prolonged periods.\n\nThe Denver Metro\/North Front Range region fell out of compliance with the federal standard for ozone pollution in 2007 and 2008, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently given the Denver Metro Area\/North Front Range region until 2015 to meet the 2008 federal standard. Local residents, businesses and industry can help by making voluntary changes in their behavior to reduce ozone and bring the area back into compliance.\n\n\"Individual residents can collectively make a significant impact on the region's air quality,\" said Ken Lloyd, executive director of the RAQC. \"We're asking everyone to pledge to commit to ozone-reducing actions and behaviors throughout the summer. Every action counts.\"\n\nThe RAQC works with meteorologists from the Colorado Department of Health and Environment (CDPHE) to issue Ozone Action Alerts on days when ground-level ozone is forecasted to reach unhealthy levels.\n\nResidents can sign up to receive action alerts and pledge to the Clean Air Community at \n\nThose who pledge to take certain voluntary actions to reduce ozone will be entered to win prizes such as bicycles, electric lawn mowers and Rockies tickets throughout the summer months.\n\nHere are some of the actions Denver Metro\/Northern Front Range residents can take to reduce ground-level ozone:\n\nDrive less \u2013 walk or ride your bike\n\nMay 30 2012\n\nRegional Air Quality Council Invites Public to \"Mow Down Pollution\"\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nRAQC kicks off ozone season with annual lawn mower exchange on June 9th\n\nDENVER\u2014May 30, 2012\u2014The Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC) and partner Black and Decker invite Colorado residents to help kick off ozone season at the RAQC's annual \"Mow Down Pollution\" event on June 9th. Mow Down Pollution is an annual lawn mower exchange event hosted by the RAQC to encourage the public to switch from polluting, gas-guzzling lawn equipment to more eco-friendly alternatives. Residents may bring their gas mowers to recycle in exchange for deep discounts on electric mowers; and discounts are offered to interested parties without a mower to recycle as well.\n\nAdvance registration is required to participate. Interested parties may pre-register at  to reserve a mower and indicate whether they will bring one to recycle.\n\nRegistrants will be assigned a time slot within which they may pick up and pay for their new mower and drop off their gas-powered mower for recycling.\n\nMow Down Pollution will be held on June 9th at Dick's Sporting Goods Park, 6000 Victory Way, Commerce City, CO, 80022, in Parking Lot H.\n\nThe following deals on Black and Decker cordless, electric lawn mowers are available to those who pre-register:\n\nModel #CM1836 18\", 36V mower (retails for $329)\n\n$99 with gas mower trade-in\n\n$149 without trade-in\n\nModel #CM1936 19\", 36V mower (retails for $389)\n\n$159 with gas mower trade-in\n\n$209 without trade-in\n\nBlack and Decker will also display electric garden tools such as trimmers and blowers at the event, which will be available for delivery order at a discounted price.\n\nGround level ozone is a harmful air pollutant that is formed when emissions from everyday items combine with other pollutants and \"cook\" in the heat and sunlight. Sources of such emissions include local industry; gasoline-powered vehicles and lawn equipment; and household paints, stains and solvents. People who are active outdoors may experience breathing difficulties and eye irritation when exposed to ozone, and prolonged exposure may result in reduced resistance to lung infections and colds. Ozone can also trigger attacks and symptoms in individuals with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma or other respiratory infections like chronic bronchitis and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\n\n\"Ground-level ozone is a health hazard for everyone, especially the young and elderly,\" said Ken Lloyd, executive director of the RAQC. \"With nearly 10 percent of the Denver area's ozone precursor emissions coming from lawn equipment, the switch to electric alternatives has the potential to make a significant impact on our air quality and health.\"\n\nThe Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC) is the lead air quality-planning agency for the Denver metropolitan area. In existence since 1989, the Council's main purpose is to develop plans and programs to keep the region in compliance with federal air quality standards -- with significant input from area citizens, businesses and local governments. The RAQC also oversees the development and implementation of air quality outreach and education programs throughout the region.

Vidal, members of the Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC), Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) and Denver B-cycle announced the start of the summer ozone season and Colorado Bike Month today at a press event, held at the Denver Performing Arts Complex. The press conference detailed the importance of improving air quality in the Front Range and how the work of RAQC, DRCOG and Denver B-cycle will continue to help move Colorado to a cleaner future.\n\n\"Summer ozone season is upon us, and we should be aware of how our daily actions directly effect our air quality and ozone pollution,\" said Mayor Vidal. \"While ozone awareness and bicycling may seem like very different topics, they are intertwined, with bicycling and public transit serving as one of the many helpful tactics anyone can take to help alleviate ozone pollution.\"\n\nColorado is a premiere bicycling state; and to celebrate bicycling for transportation, fun and fitness, June is known as Colorado Bike Month. Colorado joins a nationwide effort to encourage cycling novices and enthusiasts to experience the fun and freedom of safely riding a bike to work, school, errands and recreation, which helps reduce vehicle miles traveled and improve air quality. The highlight of Bike Month is the region's annual Bike to Work Day on June 22 \u2013 a day to celebrate bicycle commuting.\n\n\"DRCOG coordinates Bike to Work Day each year to introduce more metro residents to the many advantages of bicycle commuting, which include reducing vehicle emissions causing ground-level ozone,\" said DRCOG Executive Director Jennifer Schaufele. \"Last year, more than 17,000 people participated in Bike to Work Day, keeping nearly 300,000 miles from being driven by car \u2013 a number that's a big help during our high ozone season.\"\n\nIn an effort to help Denver B-cycle members participate in Bike to Work Day, Denver B-cycle will be encouraging all those planning on riding a B-cycle on June 22 to register for Bike to Work Day at  Denver B-cycle enables more extensive use of transit by oftentimes filling in the last mile of trips, giving downtown dwellers and visitors a way to move around without their cars. Denver B-cycle also provides members with a personal account page that not only highlights miles ridden, calories burned and money saved, but also carbon offset to help users track the many benefits of bicycling.\n\nSummer ground-level ozone pollution is the Front Range region's biggest air quality concern and is formed when emissions from everyday items combine and \"cook\" in the heat and sunlight. Sources of such emissions include local industry, gasoline-powered vehicles, lawn equipment, household paints, and stains and solvents. Ozone pollution can trigger attacks and symptoms in people with pre-existing health conditions, such as asthma or other respiratory diseases. High levels of ozone pollution also affect healthy people who work or exercise outdoors and can cause breathing difficulties, eye irritation, and reduced resistance to lung infections and colds with exposure for prolonged periods.\n\nThe Denver region fell out of compliance with the federal standard for ozone pollution in 2007 and air quality experts forecast the region to remain out of compliance with stricter standards set by the EPA in 2008. Federal officials are expected to announce even stricter standards in July 2011 making it even more critical this summer for local residents, businesses and industry to do their part to help reduce ground-level ozone help reduce the health risks associated with summer ozone pollution.\n\n\"Ozone pollution continues to be a challenge for our community and all of us need to do our part to help reduce it,\" said Andy Spielman, Chairman of the RAQC.\n\nOzone-causing emissions come from a wide range of sources.

Mow Down Pollution will be held at the RidgeGate community in Lone Tree just off of Lincoln and I-25. Enter the event near the corner of RidgeGate Parkway and Belvedere Lane just southeast of Target and northwest of the Lone Tree Recreation Center. Participants must register in advance of the event by visiting ozoneaware.org or by calling 1-800-457-8651; a limited number of lawn mowers are available at the event.\n\nWith nearly 10 percent of the Denver area's ozone precursor emissions coming from lawn equipment, the switch to eco-friendly alternatives has the potential to make a significant impact on our air quality and health for years to come. At ground level, ozone is a health hazard for everyone, especially the young and elderly. Those who are active and exercise outdoors may experience breathing difficulties and eye irritation. Prolonged exposure may result in reduced resistance to lung infections and colds. Ozone can also trigger attacks and symptoms in individuals with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma or other respiratory infections like chronic bronchitis and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). \"Ground-level ozone pollution is the Denver-area's biggest air quality concern. Its health impacts are becoming more recognized everyday,\" said Ken Lloyd, Executive Director of the RAQC. \"It is important to remember that citizens have the ability to improve our air quality by making simple changes, such as purchasing an eco-friendly lawn mower or only mowing after 5 p.m. if you own a gasoline mower.\" At the event, Colorado residents are invited to bring in an old, gasoline-powered lawn mower to exchange it for a discount on a new, Earth-friendly alternative. Neuton provides the eco-friendly mowers.

Under the program, eligible owners of high-emitting vehicles will receive $1,000 and $60 in RTD passes when they turn their vehicle over to the RAQC and its partners for salvaging.\n\nThe RAQC's goal is to salvage 220 vehicles prior to December 31, 2009, removing high polluters of hydrocarbons (HC) from area roads and helping to reduce air pollution in the region. The program aims to achieve reductions in carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and green house gases (GHG), in addition to reducing petroleum usage by replacing older vehicles with more fuel efficient vehicles.\n\n\"High-polluting vehicles pose a major challenge to efforts to reduce air pollution in the region,\" said Steve McCannon, RAQC program manager. \"Ten percent of the vehicles on the road account for approximately 50 percent of the emissions. By taking part in this program, owners of high-emitting vehicles have a real incentive to help significantly reduce emissions. And by salvaging the vehicles, we get them off the road and ensure they never pollute again.\"\n\nFor the 2008 ozone season, vehicles will be identified and recruited through the state's high-emitter program and screened by Emissions Technical Center (ETC) staff. In addition, vehicles that are eligible for the Colorado Department of Revenue's waiver program and cannot be fixed will be included in this effort. The RAQC will work with ETCs to notify vehicle owners they are eligible for the vehicle salvage program at the time of compliance testing failure.\n\nProgram vehicles will be purchased at a centralized collection point once per month. Eligible vehicles for the program must start readily through ordinary means without the use of starting fluids or external booster batteries and the vehicle must arrive at the ETC under its own power. Vehicles must also meet two of the following minimum threshold criteria:\n\nThe vehicle must fail an emissions test for hydrocarbons (HC);\n\nBe more than 10 years old;\n\nHave high-evaporative emissions;\n\nEmit visible smoke; or\n\nBe deemed irreparable or face repair costs that exceed the value of vehicle.\n\nThe RAQC's partners in the vehicle salvage program include the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR), the Old Car Council of Colorado (OCCC), Envirotest Systems Products (ESP) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD). Additional incentives for participants are also being offered by the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association (CADA).\n\nMore information on the vehicle salvage program can be found at  or by contacting the Regional Air Quality Council at (303) 629-5450.\n\nAbout Regional Air Quality CouncilJun 02 2008\n\nSummer Ozone Season Begins June First\n\nIn August 2007, Denver violated the EPA ozone guidelines, making it even more important this summer for local residents, businesses and industry to do their part to help reduce ground-level ozone to meet federal air quality standards in 2008 andLast year's violation put a spotlight on Colorado's summer air quality,\" said Ken Lloyd, executive director of the Regional Air Quality Council (RAQC). \"The summer ozone season is a critical time and, because ozone comes from so many various sources, everyone must do their part, especially on Ozone Action Alert days when conditions are ripe for the formation of ozone.\"\n\nAn Ozone Action Alert day is called by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) when weather conditions can lead to unhealthy ground-level ozone concentrations in the metropolitan Denver and Front Range region infections.

If the mold came back, the clean-up process was repeated. People were not concerned and mold based lawsuits were practically nonexistent. The earliest cases of mold-related illnesses were in the 1800\u2032s in Prague, where there was mold covered hay that affected the health of farm animals and in the 1930\u2032s in Russia, again with mold covered hay.\n\nHowever, in the 1980\u2032s mold was connected to major health issues (nasal congestion, skin rashes, asthma, headaches, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, etc.), creating a need for performing mold abatement correctly and effectively to prevent the mold from spreading.\n\nThere are over 1,000 different types of mold. Mold occurs naturally in our environment and is the earth's organic recycler. However, when mold is able to grow indoors, problems can occur. The biggest issue when performing mold abatement is spores. Mold releases spores to reproduce. The spores are what cause illness. These spores become airborne and are able to grow on any organic substance if they are introduced to optimal conditions. Mold releases spores whenever it feels threatened (this is its way of ensuring its own survival!) Mold feels threatened and releases spores whenever it is disturbed in any way (mainly by trying to cut-out and clean-up the mold!).\n\nThe key to performing effective mold abatement is to prevent the spreading of mold spores. Although there are few national guidelines for mold abatement, almost all require containment. Containment, as it sounds, is the process of containing the work area that the mold is in to prevent the spores from leaving the contained area and affecting the outside areas.\n\nAlthough that may sound simple in theory, mold spores are so small that unless the containment is secure, the mold spores can easily escape. To ensure that the contained area prevents the spores from leaving, certain procedures must happen.\n\nHere are the standard procedures to ensure that the contained area is secure:\n\n1. Plastic walls must surround the mold affected area using 6 mil plastic.\n2. An entrance way is created by securing a specially designed zipper on one (1) wall.\n3. A negative air machine creates constant suction in the room removing any spores that will be created when the mold abatement is being performed. (The negative air machine is a powerful vacuum-like machine with a HEPA filter attached and a plastic tube leaving the containment. The tube leaving the containment temporary plastic wall leads to the outside of the house or commercial property.)\n\nOnce this process has been set up, the chances of mold spores leaving the work area are very minimal.\n\nNow, the actual mold abatement can be performed. When the work is finished, the negative air machine stays on for a few days to ensure that the mold abatement and the equipment have been successful. Please be aware that a visual inspection of the removal process may not be enough. A qualified mold testing company should be hired to determine if the mold and mold spores are at a safe level.\n\nFireplaces are essential to building structures, especially throughout cold winter several weeks. They assist keep your poisonous gases created with a fire place from coming within the residence, keeping the interior air neat and safe to breathe. As the chimney is really a completely separate structure in the roof, you should not neglect its regular inspection and maintenance, as it may easily be a supply of harmful deadly carbon monoxide contamination.\n\nWhy Inspect?\n\nYou will find lots of good reasons to inspect the chimney. The very best finish from the structure is essentially uncovered to numerous outdoors elements and also the opposite finish is continually uncovered to extreme warmth, making the whole framework weaker to break.\n\nThe most typical kind of harm to occur is cracks, with numerous causation factors. Thermal fatigue is among the most typical occurrences. The main difference between inside and outdoors temps may cause the dwelling to hack, developing a passageway for leaks.\n\nThe flashing that joins the rooftop and also the chimney may also release from thermal growth of the roofing layers. Even strong winds may cause the flashing to release, which makes it ineffective within the protection it will afford. This could cause leaks round the exterior area of the structure, permitting water to soak in to the underlying roofing layers.\n\nFireplaces are most frequently used throughout the cold winter months however, a lot of things sometimes happens within the interim. A bird could next within the flue throughout the summer time several weeks, developing a blockage. Smoke could accumulate over many years of use and finally narrow the passageway, which makes it ineffective in tiring dangerous gases.\n\nWhen you should Inspect\n\nMost fireplaces are manufactured from brick masonry and often cement a couple of are manufactured from prefabricated steel. No matter what material has been utilized, you should conduct assessments the following:\n\nYearly \u2013 A yearly inspection ought to be done several several weeks prior to the winter months starts to ensure that any repairs can be created with sufficient time remaining prior to the winter months really begins. Throughout the several weeks once the chimney isn't being used, grime might have gathered. Wild birds possess a practice of nesting within the flue, which could result in a partial as well as complete blockage. Damage could also have happened from previous winter's usage and require repairs. A yearly examination might help mitigate many of these problems.\n\nSeismic Activity \u2013 After an earthquake, you should look into the chimney for cracks. The steel variety ought to be checked, as it may be also broken.\n\nSevere Storms \u2013 Strong wind and hail can harm masonry and cause gaps within the flashing. Make sure to inspect the outside of the chimney after every storm to check on for just about any new damage.\n\nSeeping \u2013 When proof of a leak seems on the ceiling, the chimney ought to be looked over along with the roof since either could cause leaks. A crack might have happened or even the flashing might have loose, permitting water to seep through in to the underlying material.\n\nSafety Tips\n\nWhen climbing onto a roof, there's dangerous of falling. When carrying out a chimney inspection, it might be more suitable to do this throughout obvious weather once the roof isn't slippery. Putting on rubber-soled footwear for further traction could be smart in addition to getting a spotter nearby who could respond immediately just in case of the fall. It might be also an excellent safety precaution to have a safety line when focusing on the surface of the structure. When the position from the roof is simply too steep or excessive, it is best to depart the task to some professional contractor.\n\nFireplaces are part of the building structure and will not be neglected. Hopefully this information has provided some useful specifics of the different explanations why a chimney inspection will not be neglected, when this kind of inspection ought to be carried out, plus some tips about accomplish this type of goal!\n\nHome remodeling is definitely an investment with exactly what involves money and assets, keeping every transaction recorded safeguards both homeowner and contractor in addition to helps solve developing problems faster. If the restoration is comparatively small or perhaps a major kitchen remodeling, an in depth written contract or signed and recognized proposal ought to be drafted and really should define:\n\nScope from the work\n\nItemized costs and payment terms\n\nTime-frame \u2013 once the work begins and finishes\n\nBlueprints (if any)\n\nSpecified building materials\n\nResponsible party for procurring needed permits\n\nA contract the contractor adheres to local codes, place of work safety and building rules\n\nContractor work warranties\n\nClaims of cancellation privileges\n\nPerformance bond to safeguard you against potential financial loss just in case the house remodeling project isn't completed as scheduled\n\nFor satisfaction and defense against risks and liabilities, make sure that each one of these products are covered within the contract. Even when you personally be aware of contractor, hands shake contracts won't ever suffice. If all needs are understood by everyone active in the project and therefore are official via a written agreement, then unnecessary disputes, frustrations and possible legal cases could be prevented.\n\nAnother significant a part of home remodeling projects you need to seem to comprehend is holdbacks and just how they try to safeguard you. A holdback may be the last 10% from the contract's total value that home owners \"restrainInch from companies upon substantial completing the project. The holdback can there be to safeguard you against lien against your home, stated through the contractor or his sub-trades. When confronted with a restoration, you will find three kinds of holdbacks:\n\nContractors Lien Holdback. This kind safeguards sub-contractors or providers by acquiring payment for work carried out or materials provided. You will find occasions whenever a contractor has satisfied the contract terms but neglect to pay his subtrades for services made or items shipped. The holdback will provide the general contractor specified time for you to request the obligations, staying away from the liability of needing to spend the money for liens from your own pocket.\n\nSubstantial Completion. A holdback should take part in every home remodeling agreement. When the restoration is substantially done or 97% complete, the contractor asks the homeowner to sign certificates of substantial completion which might be signed for the way happy you're using the result.\n\nPeriodic or Delivery Holdback. You will find certain jobs that can't be done at specific occasions of the season, for example exterior painting and landscape designs on winter or perhaps a wet season. In these instances, the total amount equaling the price of the task to become completed is held back.\n\nAlways request questions whenever your unclear about a phase of the project, most contractor could be more than pleased to explain the entire process of that they are finishing. Remember here's your home, money which if you are not completely satified, you may want to obtain a second opinion. Bear in mind that you will find many different ways to accomplish a particular phase of project. I suggest that you simply always refer to the local building codes and native personnel."}
{"text":"Smarter Living: Family Health\n\nThe Diesel on the Bus\n\nIf your child is one of the 23 million kids who ride the bus to school every day, be advised: Her bus probably has a diesel engine and the exhaust from that engine contains invisible but harmful pollutants that are getting inside.\n\nNine out of ten of the nation's 454,000 school buses burn diesel fuel. School districts typically prefer diesel engines because they're durable, heavy-duty haulers. They're so durable that a third of today's school bus fleet is 18 years or older.\n\nThe problem however is that diesel engines emit ultrafine particles that can provoke asthma attacks and increase the risk of cancer. Research conducted by the non-profit Environment and Human Health, Inc, and more recently by NRDC, show that diesel exhaust gets inside the bus. In fact, the NRDC tests showed air quality is eight times worse inside the bus than regular outdoor air.\n\n\"It's not the black soot you can see. These ultrafine particles are so tiny,\" says Diane Bailey, NRDC scientist in the Health and Environment Program, \"they can slip by the body's regular filters and travel deep into the lungs.\" From there they can enter the blood stream which is how they can cause the most damage, triggering heart attacks, asthma attacks, allergies, and bronchitis.\n\nCancer is another risk. Diesel exhaust is a toxic soup and mercury, chromium, benzene and other well known toxins hitchhike on the tiny particles, getting a ride deep into the lungs and blood stream. Some cause cancer, especially lung cancer. The State of California says diesel causes 70 percent of all airborne cancer risk. Others are neurotoxins which attack the brain, spinal cord and nerves. Diesel exhaust also creates smog, boosting local ozone levels (bad news for kids with asthma), and adding to acid rain and global warming.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nIf your child must ride the bus, encourage him to sit in the front, with the windows open.\n\nIf walking or biking is an option, that is the healthiest choice. Petition your town to install sidewalks, crosswalks and bike lanes.\n\nWork with your school to set up an anti-idling policy to stop school buses from running their engines in front of school buildings. Several school districts, towns and cities around the country, such as the city of Nashua, NH, have put in successful anti-idling laws. Read \"Smarten Up and Stop Idling\" to learn more. If cold weather is an issue, ask school officials to designate a waiting area inside the school building for drivers to warm-up.\n\nTake a look at your school's parking lot. Buses should be parked away from air intake vents in the school to prevent exhaust from entering the building. A chain of bumper to bumper buses builds up exhaust and contaminates each bus in line, so buses should park diagonally, if possible.\n\nMake sure your school district has a quality maintenance program for its bus fleet. Exhaust problems are worse in buses with poor maintenance. Retrofit older buses with pollution control traps on the tailpipe. These controls come automatically now with newer buses.\n\nEncourage your school district to replace older buses with buses that run on alternative fuels. Propane, natural gas and hybrid electric buses are the best long-term solution. Target pre-1990 buses, since emissions standards tightened up in 1991. Older buses also lack basic safety standards. New buses are expensive, often $250,000 each. Write grants to help your local school district find money to retrofit and replace buses. Best place to start: Clean School Bus USA, a federal program run by EPA. Contact them to learn about new federal funding sources and link up with local and state funding in your area.\n\nTalk to school and bus company officials about rearranging routes for the bus fleet. Move the cleanest, newest buses to the longest routes and save the oldest buses for the shortest routes. Since impacts from diesel exhaust are cumulative, this interim step minimizes exposure to all kids.\n\nWith a few simple steps, you can help to make your kids' school days healthier."}
{"text":"Water and Climate in the Himalayas\n\nKhasit Devi Latwal cooks dal and rice over an open wood fire, as her daughter watches, in her family home in the village of Chausali in the foothills of the Himalayas near Almora, Uttarakhand, India. Earlier in the morning her daughters fetched the water, waiting to fill containers at the slow-running spring in the village (see the Water portfolio here). Wood burning for cooking in the home has been the way of life for centuries, and some estimates are that two billion people burn wood as well as other types of biomass -- grass, dung and farm residues -- for heat and food preparation. Perhaps as many as three-quarters of families in India burn biomass. Increasingly it is known as a source of unhealthy indoor smoke, affecting the health of all family members. The World Health Organization estimates that about one and one-half million people die of soot-related respiratory and heart ailments yearly.\n\nOpen fires are used for cooking in small shops and restaurants also, like this roadside store in Maimajhuwa, Nepal where delicious fresh roti (donuts) were being prepared in oil. The smoke rising from a wood or biomass fire is largely soot, also called black carbon, tiny particulates which are also part of diesel smoke. A worldwide drive has begun to cut back on emissions of black carbon not only because of its ill effects on human health, but also due to its large contribution to global warming and the melting of glaciers. Part of this initiative are two signature programs of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with the State Department working with the EPA, UN Foundation, UN Environment Program and other governments: the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and a coalition to reduce short-lived pollutants (including methane). Other NGOs like the Climate Institute and World Wildlife Fund also have programs to reduce smoke from home and agricultural fires because of wood burning's role in climate change and deforestation.\n\nOne of the early changes to cookstoves to make them more efficient even while continuing to burn wood was installation of stove pipes or built-in chimneys. This kitchen in Rupsepani, Bhorle, Nepal is typical with a corner stove built into the clay and plaster walls. Aimbik Paudel has just boiled up a batch of fresh potatoes, which she graciously offered to us. Getting the smoke out of the house is one step toward family health, but millions of cooking fires across South Asia continue to sent black carbon into the air. One result of the many tons of soot is that although it is short lived in the air, great amounts are lofted up into the Himalaya and even to the arctic where it settles on glaciers. The black particles and other dusty pollution absorb sunlight, heat up and quicken the pace of glacial melt, according to a recent study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The effect in the Himalayas is so strong that the soot could be responsible for almost all the surface melting of glaciers.\n\nOther innovations and good design have improved the household cooking stove, including metal stoves with better controlled air flow and built in clay burners on vented fireplaces which are made to perfectly fit the large pots of the household. Dinners were delicious and rapidly prepared in this kitchen above Maimajhuwa, Nepal, where we stayed for several days to learn about changing agricultural and grazing practices, with guides from The Mountain Institute. Research into the broader significance of the tons of soot clogging the air of many regions of Asia and Africa has found yet another compelling reason to control it: Even though the particles don't stay in the air long (days or weeks), while they are aloft they absorb a huge amount of solar radiation. Scientists V. Ramanathan of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, James Hansen and Drew Shindell of NASA lead independent research teams which reached similar conclusions that in the coming decades reducing black carbon pollution, along with methane emissions, could directly reduce global warming. This is a major reason for the government and NGO initiatives on fire and cookstoves.\n\nThe major cause of global warming and climate disruptions is carbon dioxide, and reducing our emissions remains the most important goal for cooling the planet. CO2 stays in the air for more than 100 years and its effect is building. In the short run, however, the warming effect of black carbon and methane is very strong. The scientists think relatively easy and local controls on burning, vehicle exhaust, landfills, etc. could hold back about half the warming expected by mid-century. And reducing the amount of wood burned has other effects which have brought NGOs like the WWF into action. With much more efficient stoves or gas stoves, women around the developing world will no longer have to gather wood and fewer trees will be cut down -- a benefit not only for people and the land but also for the increase in carbon uptake by forests.\n\nOne of the ultimate solutions to the interlocking development issues of waste management, human health, deforestation, farm fertilization and women's work could be small-scale biogas. Biogas generators using farm manure and in some cases human waste are being installed rapidly, especially through programs which create carbon offsets in the UNFCCC framework. These systems create low-pressure methane piped into kitchens, eliminate the need to cut wood and collect burnable forage from the forests (and cut the need to handle, dry and burn dung in lower elevation areas), reduce health issues from inside smoke and soot, create a fermented organic fertilizer product -- and could slow global warming and the melting of glaciers from soot on the surface of the ice. The 7 households in this tiny village of Pairebensi on the Trisuli River in Nepal were among the first in the mountain foothills to get biogas systems.\n\nThe Pairebensi biogas installations serve 39 family members in the immediate village, and three nearby villages have 8 more systems installed. From the manure of three to four cattle, pigs or goats plus some fodder and plant waste put into the intake (where the woman is in this photograph) and the human waste from the toilet (on the left), a concrete digester tank can produce enough gas (piped out by low pressure, foreground) to cook for 3.5 hours daily on a single stove. The cost in Nepal for these installations was under US$600 each, paid for by grants from WWF and a Nepalese government loan program. Several programs for generating biogas from human and animal waste have been undertaken in the Terai, the warmer lowland of Nepal, but now the technology is moving up into the cooler Himalaya foothills. Higher elevation areas may be too cold for efficient use of biogas, however. WWF Nepal says its first Terai biogas project in the voluntary Kyoto Protocol offset market, which was to install 7500 gas generator systems, created verified offsets of 12,125 tons of CO2.\n\nSangita Gahle cooks on her biogas stove in the smoothed clay common room of her home in Pairebensi, making chai for us while we enjoy talking about families and her joy in cooking with gas. She said the change has made a great improvement in her life. The family used to have to collect firewood three or four times a year, and with the pressure from all the families in the area, their community forest and the buffer zone of Langtang National Park was suffering. Now the forest, which provides fresh leaf fodder for animals and protection from landslides above the village, is much more protected. Sangita said they still keep some firewood around, to burn in the old built-in kitchen stove in case of a large meal to cook or to warm the house on only the very coldest days. Talking and laughing with her and her daughter, drinking tea while sitting on the bed -- under which was stored the latest harvest of potatoes -- we had a great feeling of possibility for Nepalese to be able to protect their land and forests while improving their lives and the climate.\n\nThanks to all the people who allowed us to photograph and speak with them, and to our guides, interpreters and drivers. Thanks again to the Karuna Foundation - US, the Uttarakhand Environmental Education Center (UEEC), World Wildlife Fund - Nepal (WWF), and The Mountain Institute. Please see other portfolios on the increasing dangers from landslides and how farmers are adapting to changing climate conditions in the Himalayas."}
{"text":"A new study links even small reductions in fine particle air pollution to increased life expectancy.\n\nResearchers who compared data from 545 counties across the U.S., found that a drop in fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, between 2000 and 2007 corresponded with an average rise in life expectancy of 0.35 of a year.\n\nThe study, led by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, is described as the largest to date to find public health benefits from ongoing reductions in U.S. air pollution levels.\n\nFine particles, which are about 1\/30th the average width of a human hair, come from a variety of sources, including vehicles, smokestacks and fires. They also form when gases emitted by power plants, industry and vehicle engines react in the atmosphere.\n\nThe tiny particles can lodge deeply in the lungs, aggravating heart and lung diseases. Those most at risk include people who are active outdoors, children and the elderly.\n\nNationally, average concentrations of particulate matter, both fine and coarse, have fallen over the years. The researchers wanted to know whether the relatively smaller decreases in PM2.5 levels since 2000 are still improving life expectancy.\n\nThe study, which appears in Monday's online edition of the journal Epidemiology, controlled for changes in other factors, such as smoking and socioeconomic status. The findings showed that cutting fine particle pollution had the greatest effect on life expectancy in urban areas \u2013 possibly because of differences in particle composition.

Smoke from the fires is causing unhealthy air quality for all individuals in the impacted areas.\n\nPeople can participate in indoor sports or other strenuous activity in areas with visible smoke, soot, or ash, provided the indoor location has air conditioning that does not draw air from the outside and it has closed windows and doors to protect the cleanliness of indoor air. If not, it is recommended that all individuals follow these guidelines as if they were outside.\n\nAccording to the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD), smoke from the Station Fire near La Ca\u00f1ada has caused hazardous air quality in the San Gabriel Mountains and the West San Gabriel Valley. Areas of direct smoke impact include Altadena, La Ca\u00f1ada, Flintridge, La Crescenta, Tujunga, and Sunland. The Los Angeles County Health Officer, Dr. Jonathan E. Fielding, urges all individuals in these areas, or areas where there is visible smoke or the odor of smoke, to avoid unnecessary outdoor and indoor physical exertion, such as exercise. Additional areas that may be impacted by smoke include: the Santa Clarita Valley, San Fernando Valley, Central Los Angeles County, and East San Gabriel Valley.\n\nThe following recommendations will help people protect themselves from harmful effects of bad air quality:\n\nIfIf outdoor air is bad, try to keep indoor air as clean as possible by keeping windows and doors closed. Air conditioners that re-circulate air within the home can help filter out harmful particles.\n\nAvoidIf it is too hot during the day to keep the doors or windows closed and there is no air conditioning unit that re-circulates indoor air, consider going to an air conditioned public place, such as a library or shopping center, to stay cool and protected from harmful air.\n\nDo not use fireplaces (either wood burning or gas), candles, and vacuums. Use damp cloths to clean dusty indoor surfaces. Do not smoke.\n\nIf people should contact a doctor immediately or go to an urgent care center.\n\nWhen smoke is heavy for a prolonged period of time, fine particles can build up indoors even though people may not be able to see them. Wearing a mask may prevent exposures to large particles. However, most masks do not prevent exposure to fine particles and toxic gases, which may be more dangerous to health"}

At no cost to you!\n\nA Wildfire Awareness and Prevention Program sponsored by the Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) offer residents of western Clallam Countyan opportunity to dump their burn barrels and get a compost bin, for free! The bins, provided by DNR, can help turn yard waste into free garden fertilizer while eliminating one of the primary sources of wildfires: burn barrels.\n\nBurn barrels also produce significantly more air pollution than open burn piles. For those reasons, the state legislature banned the use of burn barrels in all areas of Washington several years ago; but the barrels continue to be used by many, despite the risks to public health and property.\n\nBy replacing that illegal burn barrel with a compost bin for your yard waste, residents will:\n\nProduce free, organic fertilizer for their yard and garden\n\nReduce harmful air pollution. Smoke from outdoor burning poses serious health risks, much like cigarette smoke. Particulate pollution from smoke may lead to increased incidents of asthma, emphysema, bronchitis, and heart and lung disease.\n\nReduce the risk of wildfire. Backyard fires that 'escape' are the leading source of wildfires caused by humans, and many of those escapement fires start in burn barrels.\n\nThere are a limited number of compost bins available for this program, so residents are urged to act NOW.\n\nDNR is encouraging homeowners, land managers, first responders, developers, business owners, and civic leaders to focus on \"Knowing Your Role\" when it comes to preparing communities for wildfire.

(\n\nThis week, our Western Washington weather turned cold, with mostly clear skies and little wind to clear the air. Cold nights and icy mornings tend to prompt more use of woodstoves and fireplaces. Unfortunately, in these conditions any smoke we put into the air around us, stays in the air around us. The result could be rising levels of air pollution.\n\nIn the interest of public health and safety, the Olympic Region Clean Air Agency (ORCAA) asks that all residents CURTAIL all outdoor burning in Clallam and Mason Counties, and to VOLUNTARILY refrain from using wood stoves and fireplaces in all counties (Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, Mason and Pacific) unless absolutely necessary.\n\nAdditionally, Thurston County remains under a STAGE 2 BURN BAN, in which all burning (indoor and outdoor) is prohibited. No wood stoves, fireplaces or pellet stoves may be used unless they are the occupants' sole source of heat ThatIn addition to minimizing the use of woodstoves and fireplaces in areas outside the burn bans, ORCAA asks homeowners to use alternative means of disposal to clean up their yards. Chipping and composting are the best option, though other alternatives to burning are also available. You can find more details on the options at  or by calling your local waste disposal company. Also please keep in mind that burning trash is ILLEGAL at all times throughout WashingtonA Stage One Burn Ban CONTINUES to be in effect in Thurston County today and will reamin so until further notice.\n\nUnder a Stage 1 Ban, no burning is allowed in fireplaces or uncertified wood stoves, and all outdoor burning is prohibited, even in areas where outdoor burning is not permanently banned. Additionally, no visible smoke is allowed from any wood stove or fireplace, certified or not, beyond a 20-minute start-up period.\n\nA system of stable, high pressure over Western Washington, coupled with cold overnight temperatures has resulted in air pollution levels climbing enough to raise concerns about the air quality and its impacts on health. A change in weather will be needed to restore cleaner air quality, yet that's not forecast to occur until well into the week.\n\nWhile pollution levels in Thurston County warrants the Stage One Ban, other counties within the jurisdiction of the Olympic Region Clean Air Agency (ORCAA) haven't reached that level. To avoid bans in their areas, the residents of Mason, Pacific, Grays Harbor, Clallam and Jefferson Counties are asked to voluntarily refrain from all outdoor burning, and to use safe alternatives to wood heat if possible.\n\nOf particular concern are fine particles released by smoke from wood stoves and fireplaces. The Washington State Department of Health recommends that people who are sensitive to air pollution limit time spent outdoors. Air pollution can trigger asthma attacks, cause difficulty breathing, and make lung and heart problems worse. Air pollution is especially harmful to children, people with heart and lung problems, and adults over age 65.\n\nOlympic Region Clean Air Agency staff will continue to monitor the situation to determine when the burn ban can be lifted. In the meantime, here are some other things people can do to help protect the air we breathe:\n\nIf you have a certified wood stove or fireplace insert, make sure you are using it properly so you don't produce excess chimney smoke. Excess smoke is always illegal. To learn more about clean burning techniques or upgrading to a certified, pellet, natural gas or propane stove, visit \n\nLimit your driving as much as possible, since vehicles are a big source of air pollution year round. Consider utilizing Intercity Transit's bus service in Thurston County as an alternative \u2014 and cleaner \u2014 means of transportation. \n\nFor more information about Burn Ban regulations, you may refer to Chapter 173-433 of the Washington Administrative Code.\n\nResidents who heat with wood asked to burn cleanly and efficiently\n\nAs the region settles into colder conditions and periods of overnight and morning fog, it is vital that we think about our impacts on the air we share.\n\nCold nights and quiet, foggy mornings like those we expect later this week tend to prompt more use of woodstoves and fireplaces. Unfortunately, in these conditions any smoke we put into the air around us, stays in the air around us. But with proper care and the use of clean-burning practices, we can keep our shared air clean and safe.\n\nResidents who heat with wood stoves or fireplaces must burn only clean, dry firewood in their home heating appliances. Their wood should be properly cured \u2013 less than 20-percent moisture \u2013 and free of dirt and debris. The woodstoves must also be properly maintained and operated so the fire draws enough oxygen to ensure complete combustion. That ensures you'll get the maximum value from your fuel with the absolute minimum smoke. Visit  for additional tips on clean burning practices.\n\nIn addition to minimizing the use of woodstoves and fireplaces, ORCAA asks homeowners to use alternative means of disposal when cleaning up their yard waste. Chipping and composting are the best option, though other alternatives to burning are also available. You can find more details on the options at  or by calling your local waste disposal company ThatWith winter quickly approaching, now is the time to focus on ways to keep energy costs low while protecting the health and well-being of your family. Olympic Region Clean Air Agency (ORCAA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offer these tips to help you do just that:\n\nMaintain your home heating system. Maintaining the efficiency of your home's heating system can have a big effect on your utility bills. Dirt and neglect can impact the efficiency of furnaces, heat pumps and even the blower systems on wood and pellet stoves. Schedule an equipment checkup with a licensed HVAC contractor to make sure your system is operating at peak performance. You should also check your system's air filter monthly and change it when it's dirty. A dirty filter will slow down air flow and make the system work harder to keep you warm thus wasting energy. \n\nSet your thermostat a few degrees lower, especially when no one is active at home. Programming thermostats to turn the temperature down 8 degrees for 7 hours each night and an additional 7 hours each weekday during the hours when everyone is at work or school could result in a seasonal heating savings of approximately 12 percent. For the average home, this could result in savings of about $180. \n\nBurn only clean, well-cured firewood in your wood-burning appliance. When every dollar counts, it is important to get the most heat you can from your firewood. The solution is to make sure it is dry before you burn it. That can take 12 months or more. If you burn dry wood in your wood stove or fireplace regularly, you'll experience great savings. And, it will take less work to build a fire with dry firewood. Visit \n\nNever burn garbage, cardboard, ocean driftwood or wet wood. It is illegal to burn anything except untreated wood and manufactured firelogs. It is important that you do not burn household garbage, plastics, chemically treated paper or garbage. \n\nUpgrade your wood-fired home heating system. If you replace an old wood stove with a more efficient one, efficiency can increase by 50 percent, 1\/3 less wood can be used for the same heat and 70 percent less particle pollution indoors and out are produced. \n\nDownload EPA's free Apps to help protect your health.

{"text":"November 11, 2008\n\nThe air -- and our kids -- can't wait\n\nHamilton's two largest steelmakers, Dofasco (now part of Arcelor-Mittal) and Stelco (now part of US Steel) did something a few weeks ago that I and others found totally perplexing. They submitted a joint application (rare in itself) to environmental regulators asking that they be granted a delay in implementing tough new environmental discharge standards. One of the reasons they're offering is that in the current economic downturn and the sharp demand for durable goods such as automobiles and appliances forcing the rules on them now would require them to spend millions they could use for other priorities -- in Stelco's case, to upgrade some outdated facilities so they can (ironically) actually meet the standards.\n\nIn short, they're saying, we'll comply, just not now.\n\nGiven that steel runs in my family, this isn't an easy one at first. Obviously, the business of business should be business and making a profit. As well, even before the current recession, the companies have become mere shadows of what they used to be. Both companies which used to employ in the tens of thousands are barely in the mid thousands now.\n\nBut despite the hundreds of millions they've both spent over the decades to reduce discharges, the discharges still happen both for water and in the air. It's especially tricky for Hamilton where an escarpment cuts through the city. Because of the 150 m cliff side, we're all too prone to weather inversions where parts of the city are milder than others during weather events and when there's excessive pollution the smog levels in the lower city skyrocket. (The worst is in the East End but thanks to Mike Harris we don't even know what the exact levels in that part of town are anymore at any given time -- we only get readings for downtown and the \"Mountain\".)\n\nThe bad air causes respiratory problems especially for children. With the high poverty levels here, people tend to migrate to where the housing is the least expensive -- which just happens to be the lower and older part of town. Generally, people up on the Escarpment tend to have higher incomes and therefore really don't care if someone \"down there\" gets sick unless it's one of their relatives.\n\nPollution control creates an opportunity to not only improve the corporate image but also to create jobs in itself which at this time is desperately needed. It also has the side effect of reducing illnesses thus reducing the strain on a heavily burdened public health care system.\n\nThere are only two options here: The first, and the preferable one, is no extension at all -- the companies must comply now. In such a case however, the federal government should give preferential tax treatment to green technologies (for these companies and others) and allow write off of new equipment that would ensure lower pollution as a carbon offset at an accelerated 100% Capital Cost Allowance rate. A 100% CCA write off should also be granted for any carbon offsets including green belting both on property as well as in other parts of town with a present dearth of trees.\n\nThe second is that they're given a one-time only extension but at a sooner date than being requested. Children and the elderly really shouldn't have to wait but if that's what it's going to come to a two year extension beyond the presently mandated date should be the maximum tolerated. Hamilton should be a natural leader in green technologies given our history, and to countenance continued excess discharges is just another slap in the face"}

Air pollution is a dangerous reality that affects our health, and slowly poisons our lungs and kills us.\n\nThe American Lung Association conducted a number of studies proving links between air pollution and heart attacks, strokes, lung (and various other) cancers, premature death, asthma, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It attacks our children, our old, our ailing, and even our healthiest citizens, leaving us with ugly results: gruesome, drawn-out sicknesses that worsen our quality of life and make us dependent upon those around us.\n\nBecause air pollution is an invisible killer, it must be monitored by scientists who specialize in toxic pollution. Without them, we have no warning signs, no way to tell that we are being infected by harmful pollutants.\n\nInstead of increasing the air monitoring, Harper is cutting a team of seven highly specialized smokestack experts, all of whom work to blow the whistle on toxic emissions and develop higher air quality standards within industry across Canada. Environment Canada's Deputy Minister Paul Boothe admits the job losses are being made in part to trim government spending and government workforce by 5 and 3 per cent, respectively.\n\nTrimming the workforce by 3%: that is the value of human life as set by Stephen Harper. More dangerous, though, is the fact that we don't seem to think we can do anything about it.\n\nIf you believe that what you don't see can hurt you, write to Peter Kent. We'll show them we're ready to fight the real killers...the Harper Government.\n\nThe Honourable Peter Kent Minister of the Environment 401 Confederation Building House of Commons Ottawa, ON K1A 0A6 Canada\n\nI don't want to die. I don't want to get asthma, or lung cancer, or have a stroke or heart attack. But your decision to cut Environment Canada's seven smokestack specialists threatens my health, and the health of all Canadians.\n\nToxic emissions and particle pollution are linked to the diseases I listed above, but they're also linked to premature death, asthma, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, says The American Lung Association. Todd Panas (Union of Environment Workers) has noted the connection between carcinogens in the air and different types of cancer. The National Geographic points to the contaminating effects of air pollution on our eco and water systems. These are risks I do not want to see my government take. Even you yourself, Mr. Kent, have acceded that your department's scientific expertise and ability to protect our country is at risk.\n\nI am therefore asking you, Mr. Kent, to reverse the decision to fire these specialists. It is vitally important to me and my community that we maintain these core environmental services, performed by the same skilled, government employees, working to improve industry standards and limit toxic emissions across our country. These scientists are also necessary to your new clean energy funding program. Without these scientists, the government cannot effectively implement the program. Finally, to cut these workers without fully analyzing the services the team provides, and without sufficiently consulting the scientists and stakeholders, is unacceptable.\n\nI look forward to seeing my interests and concerns put into action. Thank you for your time.\n\nComments\n\nHarper is working to ruin our environment, our laws, our way of life and so much more! Under him, no sensible or sound decisions are being made. His money and power is clearly of more value than our health, well-being, and state of our amazing county as a whole! Please don't let Canada down, Harper need to go!!!!\n\nI can't think of anything more important, besides water, than air quality. To even consider cutting programs or people who monitor our air, is in my view tantamount to an act of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. and those responsible for making bad decisions like this should be held criminally liable."}
{"text":"Simple, inexpensive prevention can keep your family safe\n\nOTTUMWA \u2014\nThe winter months are traditionally the most dangerous time for carbon monoxide poisoning. The silent threat increases when home owners turn on their furnaces and run leaking appliances in enclosed spaces.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) poisoning occurs after excessive inhalation of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas, but being colorless, odorless and tasteless, it is very difficult for people to detect.\n\nSymptoms of mild CO poisoning include lightheadedness, confusion, headaches, vertigo and flu-like effects. On a larger scale, prolonged exposure can lead to toxicity of the central nervous system, heart issues and even death.\n\nOttumwa Fire Chief Tony Miller says the stealth of CO poisoning is why it can be so deadly.\n\n\"The problem really is that you don't know that you're being poisoned,\" he explained. \"You'll have flu-like symptoms, especially drowsiness, and it will put you into a deeper sleep. That's the danger.\"\n\nIn addition to appliances, other sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves and gasoline-powered tools. Exposure becomes even more extreme when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.\n\nDuring the winter months, residents will close up their home against the cold, Miller said, preventing the toxic vapors from escaping to the outside. Any CO leak will be trapped inside instead of combining with fresh air or finding some other way to leave the building safely.\n\nMiller says there are two simple, inexpensive solutions to CO poisoning. Because this poisoning can affect anyone who has a gas appliance, water heater or furnace, it's especially important to make sure they're all in good working order.\n\n\"Have a professional come take a look and make sure they're working properly. A cracked heat exchange leads to leaks. If you don't get them checked out, you'll have problems,\" he said.\n\nThe fire department has always recommended smoke detectors, and CO monitors are also a great preventative measure. They have an alarm similar to smoke detectors but will make a different sound to alert residents to excessive levels of CO. For $20-$50, a combination smoke detector and CO monitor can be the first line of defense against CO poisoning.\n\n\"We don't see it a lot in Ottumwa, but nationwide it's an issue. You'll read about whole families who died of carbon monoxide poisoning because they didn't have detectors,\" Miller said. \"Sometimes cost is an issue, but it's well worth it.\"\n\nThe Ottumwa Fire Department will check on 40-50 CO monitor alarms each year, Miller says. Just like they'll check on the situation when a smoke detector goes off, they will also perform CO checks.\n\n\"We have a detector to check for carbon monoxide, and if it's higher than a certain level, we'll call the gas company,\" Miller said. \"We're happy to come out and check, and we'll do what we can. Better safe than sorry"}

It is EPA's first new recommendation since 1997 for ground-level ozone and would reduce current smog standards by 11 - 17 percent. EPA measures smog by calculating the concentration of ozone molecules in the atmosphere over an eight-hour period. The current standard is 84 parts per billion. EPA is proposing reducing that to between 70 and 75 parts per billion.\n\nEPA is taking public comment for 90 days and settle on a final number by March 12, 2008. EPA is also requesting comments on alternate standards, including keeping the current one or reducing it further to .060 parts per million. EPA monitors 639 counties nationwide, and if the standard went to 75 parts per billion, 398 counties would be out of compliance, and if it went to 70 parts per billion, 533 counties would be out of compliance.\n\nStates with noncompliance areas could lose federal highway funds. EPA is required by the Clean Air Act to review standards on ozone and other pollutants every five years.

{"text":"May 21, 2013 ? Early-life exposure to traffic-related air pollution was significantly associated with higher hyperactivity scores at age 7, according to new research from the University of Cincinnati (UC) and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.\n\nThe research is detailed in a study being published Tuesday, May 21, in Environmental Health Perspectives, a peer-reviewed open access journal published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), an institute within the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nThe research was conducted by faculty members from the UC College of Medicine's Department of Environmental Health in collaboration with Cincinnati Children's. Nicholas Newman, DO, director of the Pediatric Environmental Health and Lead Clinic at Cincinnati Children's, was the study's first author.\n\n\"There is increasing concern about the potential effects of traffic-related air pollution on the developing brain,\" Newman says. \"This impact is not fully understood due to limited epidemiological studies.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective cohort with the longest follow-up investigating early life exposure to traffic-related air pollution and neurobehavioral outcomes at school age.\" Scientists believe that early life exposures to a variety of toxic substances are important in the development of problems later in life.\n\nNewman and his colleagues collected data on traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS), a long-term epidemiological study examining the effects of traffic particulates on childhood respiratory health and allergy development. Funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, CCAAPS is led by Grace LeMasters, PhD, of the environmental health department. Study participants \u2014 newborns in the Cincinnati metropolitan area from 2001 through 2003 \u2014 were chosen based on family history and their residence being either near or far from a major highway or bus route.\n\nChildren were followed from infancy to age 7, when parents completed the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, 2nd Edition (BASC-2), assessing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related symptoms including attention problems, aggression, conduct problems and atypical behavior. Of the 762 children initially enrolled in the study, 576 were included in the final analysis at 7 years of age.\n\nResults showed that children who were exposed to the highest third amount of TRAP during the first year of life were more likely to have hyperactivity scores in the \"at risk\" range when they were 7 years old. The \"at risk\" range for hyperactivity in children means that they need to be monitored carefully because they are at risk for developing clinically important symptoms.\n\n\"Several biological mechanisms could explain the association between hyperactive behaviors and traffic-related air pollution,\" Newman says, including narrowed blood vessels in the body and toxicity in the brain's frontal cortex.\n\nNewman notes that the higher air pollution exposure was associated with a significant increase in hyperactivity only among those children whose mothers had greater than a high school education. Mothers with higher education may expect higher achievement, he says, affecting the parental report of behavioral concerns.\n\n\"The observed association between traffic-related air pollution and hyperactivity may have far-reaching implications for public health,\" Newman says, noting that studies have shown that approximately 11 percent of the U.S. population lives within 100 meters of a four-lane highway and that 40 percent of children attend school within 400 meters of a major highway.\n\n\"Traffic-related air pollution is one of many factors associated with changes in neurodevelopment, but it is one that is potentially preventable.\" Since it began operations in 2009, peering continuously at the same field of 145,000 stars in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra, it has found more than 2,700 planet-candidates.

(JPL-Caltech\/Ames\/NASA\/File)\n\n1. Kepler-22b: Goldilocks planet\n\nKepler has made an array of stunning discoveries ? from oddball solar systems to sun-scorched planets that orbit their stars in less than an Earth day. But Kepler-22b was the first discovery that truly validated the mission.\n\nThe goal for Kepler has always been to find Earth-mass planets orbiting sun-like stars at Earth-like distances. In other words, to find Earth's cosmic twins. Kepler-22b was perhaps a bit more like a big brother ? it's larger than Earth ? but its discovery was proof that Kepler was on the right track.\n\nScientists announced the discovery of Kepler-22b in December 2011. It was smack dab in the middle of its star's so-called habitable zone ? the \"Goldilocks zone\" close enough to allow water to be liquid but far enough to ensure that it didn't burn off. Kepler-22b orbits its sun once every 290 days. Moreover, its sun is the same G-type star as our sun, though slightly smaller and cooler.\n\nThe planet itself has a radius 2.4 times larger than Earth. Scientists are not sure about the composition of the planet, but some have suggested it could be a mini-Neptune with a global ocean and a rocky core. If it has an atmosphere, the temperature could be 72 degrees F.\n\n\"It's so exciting to imagine the possibilities,\" Natalie Batalha, the Kepler deputy science chief, told the Associated Press in 2011. Floating on that \"world completely covered in water\" could be like being on an Earth ocean, and \"it's not beyond the realm of possibility that life could exist in such an ocean.\"\n\nSign up to receive a selection of Editors Picks of the best stories of the week every Saturday.\n\nMOSCOW (AP) ? The U.S. Embassy employee accused of spying in Moscow flew out of Russia on Sunday, five days after he was ordered to leave the country, NTV television reported.\n\nThe Kremlin-loyal TV station broadcast video Sunday evening showing Ryan Fogle going through passport control and security at Sheremetyevo International Airport. He also was pictured in the company of embassy staff as he wheeled a suitcase into the Moscow airport, which is used by Delta Air Lines for its direct flights to New York.\n\nRussian security services announced Tuesday that Fogle, a 29-year-old third secretary in the U.S. Embassy, had been caught trying to recruit a Russian counterterrorism officer. Fogle, who was accused of working for the CIA, was widely shown on Russian television wearing a blond wig.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy on Sunday again refused to comment on the case.\n\nThe attention given to the Fogle case in Russia contrasts with recent moves by Washington and Moscow to develop closer cooperation on counterterrorism in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15.\n\nThe bombing suspects ? Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his elder brother, Tamerlan, who was killed by police ? have roots in the Russian republic of Chechnya. Tamerlan spent six months last year in neighboring Dagestan, now the center of an Islamic insurgency, and U.S. investigators have been working with the Russians to try to determine whether he had established any contacts with the militants.\n\nLittle is known publicly about Fogle's duties and activities in Russia.\n\nThe U.S. State Department confirmed that Fogle worked as an embassy employee but would give no details about his job. The CIA declined comment\n\nGary Pruitt on Sunday called the Justice Department's actions \"unconstitutional\" and said the AP hasn't ruled out legal action.\n\nIn his first television interviews since the AP reported the Justice Department seizure, Pruitt said itIn a separate interview with the AP, Pruitt said, \"It's too early to know if we'll take legal action but I can tell you we are positively displeased and we do feel that our constitutional rights have been violated.\"\n\nHe said President Barack Obama \"should rein in that out-of-control investigation.\"\n\n\"They've been secretive, they've been overbroad and abusive ? so much so that taken together, they are unconstitutional because they violate our First Amendment rights,\" he added.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the government needs to stop leaks by whatever means necessary.\n\n\"This is an investigation that needs to happen because national security leaks, of course, can get our agents overseas killed,\" he said.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said the government should focus on those who leak sensitive national security matters and not on journalists who report on them. The Texas Republican said his committee should hold hearings on how the Justice Department obtained phone records from.\n\nCornyn said the Justice Department's actions were part of a pattern for Obama's administration to quiet its critics.\n\n\"It's a culture of cover-ups and intimidation that is giving the administration so much trouble,\" Cornyn said.\n\nHe also renewed his call for Attorney General Eric Holder to resign, citing the contempt citation the House of Representatives voted against him last year for refusing to turn over documents in a failed government gun smuggling sting.\n\nWhite House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said the president \"has complete faith in Attorney General Holder.\" He also insisted the White House was not involved in the decision to seek AP phone records.\n\n\"A cardinal rule is we don't get involved in independent investigations. And this is one of those,\" Pfeiffer said OsamaThe news service viewed the story as important because White House and Homeland Security Department officials were saying publicly there was no credible evidence of a terrorist threat to the U.S. around the one-year anniversary of bin Laden's death.\n\n\"So that was misleading to the American public. We felt the American public needed to know this story,\" Pruitt said.\n\nThe AP has seen an effect on its newsgathering since the disclosure of the Justice Department's subpoena, he said.\n\n\"Officials that would normally talk to us and people we talk to in the normal course of newsgathering are already saying to us that they're a little reluctant to talk to us,\" Pruitt said. \"They fear that they will be monitored by the government.\"\n\n.\n\n\"It was sweeping and broad and beyond what they needed to do,\" Pruitt said.\n\nHe objected to the \"Justice Department acting on its own being the judge, jury and executioner in secret,\" saying the AP would not back down.\n\n\"We're not going to be intimidated by the abusive tactics of the Justice Department,\" he said.\n\nMcConnell and Pfeiffer were interviewed on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" Cornyn appeared on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said earlier this week in a little-noticed interview that he knew \"approximately\" what the IRS inspector general would report about selective targeting of conservative groups, but that it wasn't appropriate to \"accuse the IRS until you've had a nonpartisan, deep look.\"\n\nThe comments back up the White House argument that administration officials did not know enough about the investigation to condemn the IRS until the IG completed his work recently. A Treasury Department official, Neal Wolin, was informed that the IG was looking into the situation this past summer, a revelation the media and GOP have seized on to suggest the White House may have covered up the scandal in the midst of a campaign.\n\nIssa is chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\n\"I know approximately what's in it,\" Issa told Bloomberg Businessweek on Monday when asked if he knew what would be in the report. \"I.\"\n\nIssa, according to an aide, asked the IG for an investigation last spring, after hearing allegations of selective targeting of conservative groups.

We've been sharpening our coverage of design, concepts, and the objects and ideas that are shaping our world, and growing our team to help us do it. Now it's time to meet the people who are leading that charge?starting with our new Editor in Chief, Geoff Manaugh.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Geoff by name, you've almost certainly seen his work. He currently runs BLDGBLOG, where he has established himself as one of the Internet's leading voices on design and technology in the built world. His writing has also appeared in publications as varied as Dwell, Wired UK, and?yep?Gizmodo. He's a brilliant thinker, a talented writer, and a curious mind. Geoff will start here officially in late September, but we'll be toasting him tonight at an event at the New Museum. Frankly, we couldn't have found a better fit.\n\nWhat makes Geoff so perfect for Gizmodo is his innate interest in the things Gizmodo has always been drawn toward. How and why things are built, how they look, what they can do to elevate our lives; those have always been the core of our coverage. Hardware is more than a spec sheet. Software is more than code. And technology is more than just gadgets. It's systems, cities, buildings, and art. We'll continue providing the core gear coverage we always have. But we're adding layers that reflect the way technology itself has evolved.\n\nGeoff's not the only new face. In fact, our team has already started to grow. Last month Gizmodo welcomed Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan as our new Design Editor. The posts she's already written for Gizmodo speak for themselves, but her influence extends far beyond her own writing. As we continue to increase our focus on design, art, and architecture, Kelsey has and will continue to set our course towards a more tasteful tomorrow.\n\nJoining her and Geoff will be Matt Novak, who might be better known to you as Paleofuture. For the last several years, Matt has carved out a role as the world's foremost retrofuturist; from Jetsons tech to yesteryear's newspapers of tomorrow, no one covers our visions of the future with more intelligence and verve. We're thrilled that he's chosen to make Gizmodo his new home?Paleofuture name, content, and voice intact?starting today.\n\nLast?for now?and certainly not least, Adam Clark Estes will also be joining Gizmodo next week as a Senior Writer. Adam had previously been pulling double duty at Motherboard and The Atlantic Wire, and will be bolstering our tech coverage with the same whip-smart, informed, opinionated takes that have become his hallmark those places and elsewhere.\n\nAnd even beyond the people we've added, we're proud to announce also that the leading architectural voice that is Architizer has made a home for itself on Kinja. You'll be seeing plenty of their content on Gizmodo in the very near future.\n\nIt's a lot of change in a short time, but all of it for the good. We're not content to just say that we're interested in broadening our scope; we're putting the pieces in place that will make Gizmodo every bit as authoritative a voice in the areas of design and architecture and the future as we've always been in tech.

Right about now you probably have a mental picture of a cow driving down an LA freeway. That's about the only way you could truly blame LA's smog on dairy cows, but that doesn't stop some people from trying! A recent study estimates that ammonia emissions due to dairy cattle in the Southern California air basin could be almost triple the tonnage of ammonia emissions from automobiles. Ammonia is one of the ingredients in the recipe for smog. Did you catch all the key study words though - estimates, could be, and almost. Interestingly, ammonia alone does not cause smog, ammonia must react with nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere, a contaminant that does not come from farms. Automobiles and industrial sources generate nitrogen oxide emissions. The EPA reports that mobile sources are responsible for more than half of all nitrogen oxide emissions in the United States. It seems easier for some though to focus on targeting dairy operations as a way to control smog, rather than utilizing car pools, public transportation, converting to hybrids, or electric vehicles."}

As a result, accumulations of fibrous dust can continue to present an inhalation hazard when they are stirred up by vehicular traffic, by persons walking through them, or by the wind.\n\nAsbestos exposure most often occurs from products brought on to the mine property, such as brake linings, asbestos welding blankets, and pipe insulation, or products that are used in building construction, such as transite panels.\n\nReplacement of these items with asbestos-free materials is encouraged, but should be done only by miners trained in asbestos removal and abatement methods."}
{"text":"Recent studies have revealed that the weather patterns strongly influence the nature of pollutant particulates in the air.\n\nNCAS and University of Manchester scientists studied archived data to assess the role of season and weather on the amounts and chemical composition of particulates in Manchester city centre, as part of a study supported by the Sustainable Consumption Institute (SCI). This is the first long term study of detailed particulate composition in the UK.\n\n'It is well known that the effect of season and meteorology on air pollution in Manchester city centre are closely linked, with the meteorology playing major controlling role' comments scientist James Allan, 'however this study was also able to probe the chemical composition of the changing pollution.'\n\nThe data was collected using methods for measuring particulates that give very detailed information regarding the mass (size and weight) and composition of the particulates. These methods are normally confined to laboratory settings or restricted to short periods.\n\nThere have been a number of these short periods of intensive particle measurements in central Manchester between 2001 and 2007. In total, 105 days of measurements of particulates in the city have been collected together to for the first time. This multi-year study is the first of its kind.\n\nCollating the data allowed the scientists to study the chemical composition and reveal the seasonal and meteorological trends over many years.\n\nThe scientists saw that the elevated particulate concentrations during wintertime inversion conditions were mainly primary organic matter and nitrates, whereas the events during the summer were mainly in the form of sulphates and secondary organic matter, some of which are from sources outside of Manchester.\n\nDr Allan and colleagues at the University of Manchester traced the sources of the particulates to outside of Manchester using a computer model to calculate back-trajectories. In the computer model, the path of the air is followed backwards in time to discover its route towards the measurement site. They found five common directions that the air came from. Air from certain directions, where there were more pollution sources upwind, had higher concentrations of particles.\n\nChanging weather patterns as a result of climate change make this research applicable for application in a future climate. Air quality forecasting in a changing climate is a significant challenge.\n\nThe National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) is a world leader in atmospheric science with an annual budget of \u00a319 million. NCAS carries out research programmes in climate science, atmospheric composition (including air quality) , weather (including hazardous weather) and state-of-the-art technologies for observing and modelling the atmosphere (including a world-leading research aircraft). We have over 170 research scientists, including UK and world experts to work on our research programmes, and provide support to the academic community. These programmes are distributed throughout the UK, at about 20 UK universities and institutes.

{"text":"Duct Cleaning for Quackers?\n\nCaoimh\u00edn P. Connell Forensic Industrial Hygienist\n\nAlthough popular marketing organizations promote the idea that clean air ducts equate to clean air, there is actually very little scientific data to support those claims. Indeed, the reality is that new and freshly cleaned ducts generally result in higher particulate concentrations in the air, all other factors being equal.\n\nTo begin with, the absolute statement that cleaning ducts results in cleaner air is inappropriate if for no other reason than it fails to recognize that a duct system in, say, Honolulu will be significantly different than the exact same duct system in, say, Toronto. This statement is true for residential as well as industrial duct\/HVAC systems.\n\nIn situations where the air stream in ductwork has the possibility of dropping below the dew point or where ducts are actually damp and organisms are actively growing, one would of course clean the ducts, but only after the moisture problem had been corrected.\n\nLet's use a case example of a typical duct system located in a home in a more temperate zone, say, from 35\u00b0 north on up. (The 35th north parallel would roughly pass through Albuquerque, Nashville, Oklahoma City, Seville Spain, Nicosia Cypress, Athens Greece, Rabat Morocco, Algiers Algeria, etc.) First of all, one should stop and ask \"How did the ducts get dirty in the first place?\" Some people seem to think dirt in a duct system is somehow there because of spontaneous generation, and as it \"grows,\" the threat for entering the air-stream increases; but such is not the case. The ducts got dirty because as air moved through the duct, some of the particulate loading in that air-stream dropped out of the air-stream and remained in the duct. That is, the air coming out of the duct is slightly cleaner than the air going in; the balance of material is that found in the duct. As the duct gets dirtier, turbulence in the duct increases, and, through a variety of mechanisms, a greater proportion of particulates drop out of the air-stream. That is, the air coming out of the duct is even cleaner than before.\n\nThe dirt is in the duct because the duct work filtered that junk out of the air, and it remains in the duct because it is stable there. Clean ducts, by virtue of the fact that they are clean, are less efficient filters.\nThe Indoor Environments Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency states 1\n\nthere is no evidence to show that cleaning air ducts improves air quality. And The American Lung Association states:\n\nWith increasing attention focused on health concerns from biological contaminants and dust in the indoor environment, the ALA offers the following recommendations regarding the use of duct cleaning:\n\nDuct cleaning has not been shown to prevent health problems, nor is scientific evidence currently available to conclusively demonstrate that particle (e.g., dust) levels in homes increase because of dirty air ducts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend that air ducts be cleaned routinely, but only as needed.\n\nWhen health problems are believed to be the result of biological contaminants or dust in indoor air, it is important to first determine that contaminated ducts are the cause of the health problems and verify that the ducts are, in fact, contaminated. The source of the problem may lie elsewhere, so cleaning ducts may not permanently solve the problem.\n\nPeople who have their ducts cleaned should verify that the service provider takes steps to protect individuals from exposure to dislodged pollutants and chemicals used during the cleaning process. This may involve using HEPA filtration when cleaning, providing respirators for workers and having occupants vacate during cleaning.\"\n\nIn a recent study,1a the authors found not only that: Duct cleaning had no measurable effect on supply air quality. but in some of their study buildings, the particulate loading in the air increased following duct cleaning.\nNot all of the information out there is scientific; even your Mum's favourite magazine, Better Homes and Gardens concluded: 2\n\n\u2026 knowledge about the potential benefits and possible problems of air-duct cleaning is limited because conditions in every home are different. The quality of air inside your home can be affected by cigarette smoking, cooking, and open windows. Even vacuuming the carpets can kick up household pollutants. With so many sources of indoor pollution, it's difficult to prove any role that ducts play in adding to the problem.\n\nOne recent study3 is often cited as support for the argument that duct cleaning reduces airborne fungi in residences. However, the conclusions by the authors are not well supported by their reported data. In that study, the authors report that the airborne fungi in a home was reduced after the ducts were cleaned. However, not only did the researchers clean the ductwork, but they also installed high efficiency electrostatic filters in the ventilation units. In their conclusions, the authors attribute their results exclusively to duct cleaning and seem to entirely forget that they also installed the ESP filters. I believe that their data demonstrate that the installation of the high efficiency filters alone was sufficient to produce the reduction of airborne fungal entities seen in their study homes and the duct cleaning had very little if anything to do with the reduction in some airborne fungi. I say \"some\" airborne fungi because in the study (and not usually reported by those who quote the study to support duct cleaning) the concentrations of several genera of fungi actually increased after duct cleaning. In general, the study performed by Garrison and Robinson has several fundamental deficiencies that reduce the confidence in the results and conclusions.\n\nCleaning the duct does two things 1) reduces the filtering efficiency of the duct system (i.e. the air coming out of the duct after cleaning is dirtier than before cleaning) and 2) disturbs the material such that any remaining dirt really does have an increased possibility to re-enter the air stream.\n\nSince the relative humidities we see in most properly operating systems are simply not sufficiently elevated to exclusively support mite or fungal growth, these organisms do not normally colonize ducts. Therefore, unless there are very unusual circumstances, at this time, I have not found any compelling reason to recommend the cleaning of the ducts in systems that have not suffered water loss or water intrusion problems.\n\nOur Industrial Hygienist, Caoimh\u00edn P. Connell, was recently the featured guest on a trade-oriented radio program, and that interview can be heard here."}
{"text":"Rock Law\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently considering revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for particulate matter. That change may be proposed in early 2011, and the revisions may make it much more costly and difficult for mines and mills to operate. The bottom line is to pay close attention as these standards are developed and to submit solid data to support distinctions between urban and rural particulate; as well as data showing how much particulate pollution arises from natural and out-of-state sources. These data may help avoid needlessly draconian standards.\n\nSection 109 of the Clean Air Act, adopted in 1970, tells EPA to set NAAQS at levels \"the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator. . . allowing an adequate margin of safety are requisite to protect the public health.\" EPA is required to update the standards every five years. The courts have repeatedly held that setting these standards is strictly a public health judgment; the economic and technical feasibility of attaining the standard are not to be considered at this stage. Those feasibility factors are to be considered, if at all, when the air quality standard is translated into specific emission limits for each source.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, EPA changed the standard's focus from total suspended particulate (TSP) to smaller particulate and changed the standard to one controlling particulate matter smaller than 10 microns in size (PM10), because these posed the greatest health threat. EPA has since refined this understanding further with a separate standard for particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5). Unfortunately, the monitoring network is not yet extensive enough to allow easy correlations between PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations and different medical results.\n\nEPA will be making choices about revised PM10 and PM2.5 standards, and the agency has to decide not only the allowable concentration of different size particulates in the air, but also the proper averaging time for compliance (e.g. three hours), the number of allowable exceedances over time (e.g. one every three years), and whether the division into different size particles continues to make sense. EPA is discussing a range of changes, but the practical effect of most of them will be to make the standard much more stringent.\n\nAs more stringent NAAQS for particulates are translated into more stringent emission limitations for specific sources, mines and milling operations will almost certainly face costly choices \u2014 even though compliance problems in that vicinity may be outside their control. This problem is especially true for those who operate in arid, naturally dusty parts of the United States. These problems may include the following:\n\n1. Fugitive dust. Most of the western United States is arid, and windblown dust is common. Although this dust is less dangerous to people than urban particulate from combustion sources, the courts have rejected EPA's past efforts to distinguish between urban and rural particulates. Thus, the air may be dusty from natural causes, but contribute to a compliance problem.\n\n2. Interstate and international pollution transport. Weather systems do not respect national \u2014 or state \u2014 boundaries. Since the 1990 Clean Air Act was passed, Chinese dust storms have measurably affected local air quality in the United States, and Canadian forest fires have visibly affected air quality as far south as Virginia. Similarly, upwind U.S. states contribute to the fine particulate load at downwind states, a serious problem in much of the eastern half of the United States. EPA is trying to address that problem in the Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR), which will impose additional controls on sulfur dioxide emissions from electric generating units in more than 30 states, mostly east of the 100th meridian. The data suggest that such transport will make it harder for downwind sources to comply."}

This measurement rated as Moderate, on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Index (AQI) scale. PM2.5 measurements were in the \"Moderate\" range across most of the affected areas on all three days. Hourly PM2.5 measurements were generally in the 20 to 40 \u00b5g\/m\u00b3 range largely because of Saharan dust in the affected areas, with higher spikes from local influences at some sites. Speciated PM2.5 measurements were only available from a few sites in the eastern half of the state on the 26th, but all of the measurements in this area showed highly elevated levels of silicon indicating dust dominance, ranging from 2.0 \u00b5g\/m\u00b3 at Dallas Hinton to 3.9 \u00b5g\/m\u00b3 at Deer Park.\n\nBackward air trajectories indicate that the air came across the Atlantic Ocean.

Ned Rozell is a science writer at the institute.\n\nCathy Cahill got a package in the mail last week from a desert on the other side of the world. She didn't know what was inside, but she hoped it was air samples from Baghdad. When she opened the package, she didn't believe her eyes.\n\n\"I've never seen that much dust (on a slide used for air sampling),\" she said. \"There's so much that it's flaking off.\"\n\nCahill, who works at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, studies air quality in Alaska and all over the world. In November, Pam Clark of the U.S. Army Research Lab in Adelphi, Maryland, asked Cahill if she could deploy a few air samplers at Army camps in Iraq, as part of an Army program to study the air in places where military members are stationed.\n\nCahill enlisted a few soldiers to help her, and she is now sampling the air around the clock at two sites in Baghdad. Her first batch of samples came to Alaska in the form of eight transparent slides that captured things floating in the air.\n\nThe slides fit inside an instrument that uses a pump to suck in air and trap different-size particles on different slides. The slides she received are all filthy, from coarse reddish-yellow dust to fine black material.\n\n\"The black is usually diesel from generators, trucks, and other stuff along those lines, Cahill said. \"Most of the sizes (of particles) I'm dealing with here are things that get in people's lungs.\"\n\nCahill was preparing to send some of the samples on her desk to the University of Arizona in Tucson so that scientists can look for biological material in the air that soldiers are breathing in Baghdad. She said sands often carry with them fungi and bacteria that can make people ill.\n\nShe will also send a portion of the samples to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California to see the precise composition of the gunk on the slides. From her initial samples, Cahill thinks she can tell the days when dust storms struck.\n\n\"Looking at the color of the strips, they look an awful lot like the air I've seen from Beijing,\" she said. \"They don't look like anything we'd get in Alaska.\"\n\nCahill has set out the same air samplers near Augustine Volcano, in Cook Inlet, and at Poker Flat Research Range, and she's grateful for the chance to put her expertise to work in Iraq.\n\n\"This is a case where I can do something that's important,\" she said. \"These are my neighbors (from Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks) that are over there. If I can get baseline information, we can figure out what we can do to help them.\"\n\nTweedsmuir Glacier Update\n\nTweedsmuir Glacier has surged into the Alsek River\nin northern British Columbia.

{"text":"Program Links\n\nResources\n\nThe Ozone Weekend Effect in California\n\nThis page last reviewed June 19, 2009\n\nThis website provides information\nregarding research on the \"ozone weekend effect\", the phenomenon of\nozone concentrations tending to be higher on weekends than on weekdays\nin many urban areas around the world. This tendency is counter to\nexpectations because the emissions of ozone precursors (NOx\nand ROG) are lower (NOx more so than ROG) on\nweekends than weekdays. This counter-intuitive phenomenon is due to the\nfact that NOx emissions are primarily in the\nform of NO, which reacts to destroy ozone (O3) present in the air\n(i.e., suppresses ambient concentrations) to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2).\nHowever, this NO2, as well as additional NO2\ncreated from the NO emissions by photochemical catalytic reactions\ninvolving ROG (i.e., a single ROG molecule can recycle several times\nand oxidize multiple NO molecules to NO2\nmolecules) can react in sunlight to increase ozone concentrations. The\nphotolysis of NO2 (i.e., sunlight splitting the\nNO2 molecule into NO and O) is the only known\nsignificant pathway for creating the proper oxygen atom for reacting\nwith the abundant oxygen molecules (i.e., O2) in\nthe atmosphere (18%) to form ozone. The ROG emissions effectively\nenhance the conversion of NO to NO2 and\nultimately the formation of O3 concentrations significantly above\nnatural continental background levels (30-40 ppb). Thus, although fresh\nNOx emissions initially reduce ambient O3\nconcentrations, it is the magnitude of NOx\nemissions that control global background and regional maximums in O3\nconcentrations.\n\nA weekend effect workgroup was\nformed in 1999 to investigate the phenomenon and coordinate research\nefforts.

{"text":"Summary\n\nThis report sets out new evidence of how higher targets on greenhouse gas emission reductions in the European Union, as part of policy to mitigate climate change, would bring about health gains for Member States and European citizens.\n\nThis report sets out new evidence of how higher targets on greenhouse gas emission reductions in the European Union, as part of policy to mitigate climate change, would bring about health gains for Member States and European citizens.\n\nThe health benefits resulting from the implementation of climate policy occur because as emissions fall, reductions in certain other air pollutants (fine particles, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide associated with power generation and transport) also take place. As a consequence, the ambient air is healthier and the incidence of respiratory and cardiac disease, associated with exposure to polluted air, falls. Since these conditions are both major contributors to morbidity and mortality in Europe, the impact is very significant both for the health of the population and in slowing the upward trend in health care budgets.\n\nThe report is timely because EU Member States are currently discussing the European Union's position on climate policy. The EU has currently a 20% target on reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. A move to a 30% reduction target is supported by several countries and discussions on how to go about this may take place at either the Environment Council meeting on 14 October or even the Heads of State and Governments Council meeting on 28-29 October. The EU is also preparing for the Cancun international climate change negotiations in Mexico in December 2010.\n\nWhat are the findings?\n\nThe report quantifies the health benefits of cleaner air associated with moving to a 30% emissions reduction target. Calculations are made for both 30% \"with flexibility\", which is what the European Commission calls \"30%\", and the more ambitious 30% internal target, which does not allow offsetting in third countries. The latter would bring considerably higher health benefits for Europe.\n\nThe report:\n\nCalculates the savings in the EU due to ill-health as well as loss of life\n\nProvides the first-ever figures for health benefits per Member State, including detailed figures for eight countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the UK)\n\nCompares health benefits with the costs of implementing the 30% target\n\nDemonstrates that immediate action on climate policy would produce more benefits than if the changes were delayed\n\nThe findings in figures\n\nEU health cost savings: If the European Union shows l leadership by stepping up its current 20% target in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (from 1990 levels) to a 30% domestic target, the additional benefits will total up to \u20ac30.5 billion per year by 2020 (as a result of the commitment to the extra mitigation effort). (Our analysis follows the approach of the European Commission in estimating costs and health benefits as \"per year in 2020\").\n\nIn its May 2010 Communication, the European Commission estimates health benefits at up to \u20ac16.7 billion. This figure relates only to loss of life associated with exposure to air quality. The review's estimate is considerably higher because it takes into account morbidity (ill-health) as well as mortality. The additional costs in the study estimate are related to cases of chronic bronchitis, cardiac and respiratory hospital admissions, restricted activity days due to poor air quality, consultations for asthma and upper respiratory symptoms and days of respiratory medication use by adults and children. (See Table 2, Technical section of the report).\n\nIf the EU were to move to a 30% internal target, the savings of \u20ac30.5 billion in health costs avoided in 2020 would be in addition to the public health benefits anticipated in association with the current EU 20% target on emission reductions estimated at \u20ac52 billion per year in 2020.\n\nMember State health cost savings: Cost savings of a 30% target in greenhouse gas emissions for eight Member States are as follows:\n\nA breakdown of the effects that contribute to the national costs shown above can be found in the tables in the report's appendix.\n\nWhile the above eight countries take the greatest share of the benefits, some countries, such as Luxembourg, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Hungary, have higher health benefits per capita. (Figures are available on request)\n\nComparison with climate change policy implementation costs: The health gains measured in the study represent only the tip of the iceberg of overall benefits. They do not take into account the wider impacts of climate change on health caused by phenomena such as heat-weaves, floods, droughts and reduced food production. Nor do they take into account a raft of other health co-benefits, such as the health savings associated with climate policy to reduce private car use and promote more walking and cycling, which would improve fitness and reduce cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and depression.\n\nNevertheless, the estimates of savings are significant compared to costs of implementing the rise to a 30% target. The European Commission's Communication put the additional costs of the 30% internal target at \u20ac46 billion by 2020, or 0.3% of GDP. This compares with our estimates of health benefits of up to \u20ac30.5 billion.\n\nSimilarly, the European Commission estimates the costs of moving to a 30% \"flexible\" target \u2013 the one to which the Commission most frequently refers - at \u20ac33 billion. This compares with our study estimate on savings of up to \u20ac14.6 billion.\n\nEarly action doubles benefits: The study also shows that acting immediately on climate policy will produce greater benefits for health. As an illustration, the report includes a chart comparing the cumulative benefits predicted for 2020 as a result of acting now as opposed to starting action in 2015. It shows that the benefits are 250% higher if the move to the 30% internal target takes place immediately rather than after a delay of five years. If action starts today the cumulative benefits are estimated at up to \u20ac163 billion compared with up to \u20ac63 billion if action starts in 2015.\n\nAbout the figures: The technical report is the work of Dr Michael Holland, EMRC, UK. He is an independent consultant who has worked for both the European Commission and UN\/ECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention) on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution on similar cost-benefit studies. In September 2008, he produced a less detailed report for HEAL and others entitled Co-benefits of stronger climate change policy report. In the new report, he shows that the previous study for HEAL underestimated \u2013 rather than exaggerated - the health benefits of strong climate change policy.\n\nQuotes from experts:\n\nMedical perspective\n\n\"Doctors have been too timid about highlighting the risks to human health from rises in greenhouse gases. This report gives them an opportunity to put the health-based case and show that an investment now can achieve a quick return for health.\"\n\n\"Circulatory and respiratory diseases are a major cause of ill health in Europe. Approximately 230,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of exposure to air pollution would die prematurely following exposure to air pollution, with associated costs equivalent of 1.5-4% of EU GDP.\"\n\nDr Michael Wilks, Climate Adviser and Immediate Past President of the Standing\nCommittee of European Doctors (CPME). is the representative organisation of over 1,3 million European doctors through its full members, the most representative National Medical Associations of 27 countries in Europe. CPME works closely together with its other members, four National Medical Associations from associated and observer countries as well as with specialized European medical associations.\n\nPatients' perspective\n\n\"Stronger climate action means reductions in greenhouse gases and cleaner air, and is a welcome breath of fresh air for Europe's 30 million people with asthma. For any family with asthma or other chronic respiratory disease, this means fewer days on which they must stay at home because pollution levels makes it difficult for them to breathe outside. \"\n\nThe report quantifies the number of days of restricted activity that could be avoided per year by 2020 if the EU moved from its existing target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to a 30% internal (domestic) target. For example, the EU as a whole, there would more than 13 million fewer days of restricted activity among the working age population. Figures for eight Member States are included in the Appendix 1 of the report.\n\n\"Clean air is very important to anyone with a respiratory condition. This report helps make the climate link and provides compelling evidence of how important tackling climate change is within the prevention agenda of patients' groups representing those with asthma, allergies and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \""}
{"text":"Many environmental factors, both indoors and outdoors, can cause or worsen respiratory disease. Although in many cases individuals have little influence over environmental exposures (e.g., weather conditions), there are many (such as environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and outdoor air pollution) where interventions can improve health. While for environmental exposures such as air pollution, remediation largely devolves to the government, for exposures such as ETS advice to individuals in these settings will confer benefit. Climate change has begun to feature more and more in the context of health but how this may affect pulmonary disease remains debatable. It is possible that heat associated changes in allergen exposures may be more than counterbalanced by potential reductions in cold related exacerbations of diseases such as COPD. An improved assessment of environmental exposures is key in how we approach the effects of the environment on lung disease which would allow better understanding of gene-environment interactions and how remediation might influence population health for the better.\n\nReview Series: Occupational and environmental lung disease: The non-occupational environment and the lung: opportunities for intervention.

{"text":"Cleaner Cars Credited for Better L.A. Air, but Pollution is Still the Worst in U.S.\n\nAug 28, 2012\n\nThe notoriously smoggy skies of Los Angeles are a little bit cleaner than you might expect, at least in one respect. According to a study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the levels of certain vehicle-related pollutants in Los Angeles have dropped by 98 percent since the 1960s. The study has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres but is not yet available online.\n\nThe study looked specifically at pollutants called volatile organic compounds, which are emitted by cars and trucks. VOCs are one of the contributing factors to ground-level ozone, which had hazardous not only to people, but also to plants.\n\nThe drop in VOCs was most significant from 2002 to 2010, when they were cut in half. This drop was despite the fact that drivers in Los Angeles now use three times as much gasoline and diesel fuel as they did 50 years ago.\n\n\"The reason is simple,\" the study's lead author, Carsten Warneke, a NOAA-funded scientist at the University of Colorado, said in a written statement. \"Cars are getting cleaner.\" Contributing factors in the VOC decline cited by the NOAA include catalytic converters, improved engine efficiency, and reformatted fuels that are less prove to evaporation.\n\nThis doesn't mean that Los Angeles residents can breathe easier, however. While overall VOCs have dropped, some of the compounds remain at high levels. Propane and ethane, which are emitted by the burning of natural gas and other sources, have not declined as quickly. Another NOAA study recently found that a third VOC, ethanol, is increasing.\n\nMeanwhile, although VOCs contribute to ozone, they are not the only factor influencing LA's infamous ozone-laden smog, which remains the worst in the country, according to the annual State of the Air report from the American Lung Association.\n\n\"Ozone and particle pollution contribute to thousands of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and deaths every year,\" Kari Nadeau, a Stanford Medical School professor and American Lung Association researcher, said when the State of the Air report was released. \"Comments\n\nTue, Sep 4, 2012\nFrank BrunnerErie\n\nJunk science give junk answers. The Lake Michigan study and the Texas DNR study found that VOCs were not the cause of ozone related smog. EPA need to turn back to scientific principles.\n\nTue, Sep 4, 2012\n\nThis success is even more notable considering that now much more ethanol is used in fuels now and these fuels have a partial exemption from evaporative (RVP) emission requirements. It's interesting to think that the air quality would have been much better w\/o ethanol. Also, most ethanol is produced in coal-fired plants that also are exempt from MACT standards. Hence, despite this, we have cleaner air.\n\nTue, Aug 28, 2012\nMark LangfordSan Antonio\n\nInteresting that an area with the highest ozone has asthma rates lower than the national average.

{"text":"Airborne Asbestos (definition of)\n\nAlthough asbestos fibers can be ingested in drinking water (as was the case in certain communities where water pipes had been manufactured using asbestos-impregnated concrete), it is far more commonly inhaled.\n\nAirborne asbestos can come from any number of sources, including natural ones, as was the recent case in a housing development east of Sacramento, California, when construction activities disturbed deposits of serpentine, from which \"white\" chrysotile asbestos is made.\n\nAirborne asbestos can also come from the wearing down of automotive brake linings that are manufactured with this substance. However, the most common source of airborne asbestos is from the numerous building materials used over the past century, and are still present in older buildings and sea-going vessels.\n\nMuch of the asbestos contained in these locations exists in the form of insulation and pipe lagging. When it is solid, it poses little hazard. However, over time, this asbestos insulation can become brittle and begin to crumble. As this happens, millions of microscopic fibers are released into the air. When asbestos materials are in this state, they are called friable. Most state regulations as well as the EPA define \"friable\" asbestos as any material that can be crushed using one's hand alone."}

Martin, M.D., associate director for disease prevention and health promotion at the Eunice Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the National Institutes of Health will deliver a plenary lecture titled \"Prenatal and Early Childhood Exposure in Adult Diseases.\"\n\nRepresentatives from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Jefferson County Department of Health, the Birmingham mayor's office and a local organization called Greater Birmingham Alliance to Stop Air Pollution will also speak.\n\nThe Environmental and Translational Medicine Program, which launched in early 2012, \"puts UAB at the forefront of environmental medicine,\" says Victor Thannickal, M.D., professor and director of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine. \"The program brings together experts from across UAB \u2014 physicians, public health professionals, engineers, chemists and biologists \u2014 in a wide-ranging collaboration of basic science, translational research and community outreach.\"\n\nThe Clean Air Initiative \"will improve lung health for those in central Alabama and it will add to the body of knowledge about the health impact of air pollution on people worldwide, a growing problem in industrialized and developing nations in which public policy promoting clean air often lags behind economic development,\" says Veena Antony, M.D., director of the Environmental and Translational Medicine Program and professor of medicine in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine.\n\n\"The environment can have a profound effect on human health,\" said Veena Antony, M.D., a professor in the UAB School of Medicine'sDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and director of the new program. \"Some environmental issues arise from pollution or man-made toxins, but others are natural, from bacteria present in the air, water or soil, for example. This program will study and treat the effects on human health from any environmental exposures.\"\n\nThe program has three components: providing clinical care for patients with disease tied to environmental exposure; public education on the health effects of such exposure; and a research component that will work to better assess the risks of exposure, identify sources of exposure and search for ways to mitigate or reduce exposure.\n\n\"This initiative will put UAB at the forefront of environmental medicine,\" said Victor Thannickal, M.D., professor and director of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. \"We will bring together experts from across campus \u2014 physicians, public health professionals, engineers, chemists and biologists \u2014 in a wide-ranging collaboration of basic science, translational research and community outreach.\"\n\n\"In addition to improving lung health for those in Central Alabama, this initiative will add to the body of knowledge about the health impact of air pollution on people worldwide, a growing problem in industrialized and developing nations in which public policy promoting clean air often lags behind economic development,\" said Antony. \"These findings also hold promise for treatment of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis.\"\n\n\"Chronic lung disease is endemic in the Birmingham area,\" said Thannickal. \"Some, such as COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, have no cure. Prevention, or at least early diagnosis, is essential.\"\n\nOne of the first research projects the program will launch will search for bio-markers of lung disease through the development of an environmental sensor \"nose\" that allows for rapid, immediate testing of exhaled breath, similar to the alcohol breath analyzer.\"\n\nThe analyzer is a simple device. A person breathes into a chilled tube; the warm breath condenses in the tube, and its condensate can be studied for what Antony calls signatures to specific exposure to air-pollution sources.\n\n\"These signatures will give us early warning of potential lung injury from specific toxins in the air,\" she said. \"Standard lung-function tests detect disease when it has already begun to damage the lungs. We need a way to diagnose lung injury much sooner, so we can intervene and begin taking the necessary steps to minimize the effects.\"\n\nThe program will hold a multidisciplinary symposium on Environmental Lung Health Education and Research on Sept. 21, 2012, in Birmingham.\n\n\"UAB has a strong commitment to lead efforts to improve the health of the people of Alabama,\" said Antony. \"The creation of the Program for Environmental and Translational Medicine will bring together a spectrum of disciplines to address this challenge and educate the community on the impact of the environment on human health.\"\n\nUAB's four campus buildings featuring green vegetative roofs have performed well through the years, but are largely out of view of the public.\n\nThe latest vegetative roof can be viewed up close and personal.\n\nEight university departments and student organizations recently built and planted the first easily visible vegetative roof on the second floor of the Hill University Center. The roof is the first pilot-scale green roof at UAB to include an irrigation system, supporting mostly native plants and fresh herbs that Sodexo chefs will use to prepare meals in the Blazer Caf\u00e9 Food Court.\n\n\"This has just been a phenomenal project,\" says Julie Price, a fourth-year doctoral student in biology under Stephen Watts, Ph.D., and coordinator of the development. \"These groups have worked together tremendously well to construct something that has a real opportunity to be attractive to everyone who passes. We have flowering plants and evergreens, and they're all butterfly attractors. We expect to see birds and insects around. It's going to be great to see what this will become.\"\n\nDepartments including Biology, Engineering, Facilities Roofing Maintenance, Campus Services & Grounds, and Energy Management and student groups including Science & Technology Honors Program, Leadership Foundations and the Green Initiative all contributed to the project, which is one of the first developments by UAB's Sustainability Committee to come to fruition, says Olen Pruitt, assistant vice president for Facilities Management.\n\n\"The Sustainability Committee is trying to encourage the use of green roofs and gather the information and publicize and market it,\" Pruitt says. \"This is a pilot program. What we're trying to do is demonstrate that green roofs are practical, economical, great for the environment and great for research. This is getting students involved in a real application of their skills. It's not just theoretical any more. They're doing research on real roofs. Hopefully they can leave from here and encourage new structures like this one to be built and used wherever they go to work.\"\n\nThe buildings on campus that currently have green vegetative roofs include the Hulsey Building, the engineering side of the Business-Engineering Complex, Chemistry Building and Campbell Hall. Chemistry and Campbell Hall house several test roofs, and there are research beds on the BEC. Most of these roofs have been operational for two years or more.\n\nThe new roof on the HUC \u2014 while significantly smaller than the others \u2014 is the most complex both in build and in plant selection.\n\nThe roof features a 20,000-gallon drip-irrigation system that catches the rainwater and uses a minimum amount of water to keep the plants properly hydrated.\n\n\"It's a drip irrigation system, but it has capillary dispensers on it that really minimize the amount of water needed to keep it moist,\" says Robert Peters, Ph.D., professor of environmental engineering.\n\n\"The soil is only about four to six inches deep,\" Watts adds. \"The irrigation system enables the plants to use the water as they need it, and then slowly release it; that way you have the water going back out in a natural cycle.\"\n\nThat creates another advantage \u2014 a limited amount of water runoff into the storm water drain, something UAB researchers hope to replicate with future green vegetative roofs. By collecting the stormwater from the roof and pumping it back through the irrigation system, it keeps polluted water from running into area creeks.\n\n\"We sit at the bottom of a valley, and all of the water coming into the valley goes into the storm system, which goes into a creek that feeds into the Black Warrior River \u2014 where we get our drinking water,\" Pruitt says. \"Runoff carries pollutants with it. We don't really want the storm runoff from an urban area going into the Black Warrior River. Now, imagine the effect this could have if there were hundreds of downtown buildings with these types of roofs.\"\n\nThe plants being used also are unique for UAB green roofs. The Hulsey Building, for example, has hundreds of sedums, a desert-like plant. For the HUC, Price selected mostly native plants \u2014 including many perennial sun plants \u2014 and worked with Sodexo to pick the right herbs needed to prepare meals. Basil, thyme, oregano, chives, peppermint, rosemary, sage and cilantro are among the herbs that were planted. The Leadership Foundations student group initially met with Sodexo to get approval to plant the herbs for use in the dining halls and then used their funds to purchase the herbs.\n\n\"We planted them by meal so it would be easy for the Sodexo workers to get them,\" Price says. \"We've got pasta night in one area, soup night in another. It's pretty cool.\"\n\n\"I just can't say enough about how much I appreciate these organizations and their hard work,\" Price says. \"I think it's awesome that we were able to pull so many people together to do this. It's the first time Facilities Roofing Maintenance and Campus Services & Grounds have collaborated together on a green roof, and the university has just been so receptive. They've given us some freedom with the project. I hope it works out and really looks good. I know we're going to learn a lot from it.\"\n\nCampus green roofs\n\nPruitt says the other campus green roofs have performed well.\n\nOne of the first questions he always gets is, \"Have you ever had a roof leak?\" That has never happened. All of the roofs are checked thoroughly by UAB Roofing Specialist Roger Brown.\n\nThe roofs also have provided tremendous benefits \u2014 especially in terms of power savings.\n\nPeters says the roof is an insulator. The majority of the plants go through a process known as evapotranspiration, which gives off a cooling effect. That combined with the moist soil helps drop temperatures dramatically in the summertime and has resulted in a 20 to 25 percent savings in power bills. The insulation provided by the layer of soil and plants also can double the life of the roof membranes. When that is included with other Facilities Management improvements like alterations in lighting and air conditioning during non-peak campus hours, UAB is approaching $10 million in energy savings.\n\nThe green roofs have been a big part of that, which is why continuing to construct and research green roofs is important.\n\nAnd it's not just vegetative roofs making a difference.\n\nWhite reflective roofs have been put on several buildings \u2014 including Heritage Hall, the newest academic building \u2014 and can be used on other buildings on campus where vegetative roofs aren't possible. White reflective roofs can be retrofitted onto almost any building, Peters says.\n\nBoth the vegetative and white reflective roofs are considerably cooler in the summertime than standard black roofs. The surface temperatures on the vegetative and white reflective roofs have been around 110-115 degrees during the peak summer season, according to UAB research. Black roofs run closer to 190 degrees during the middle of the day.\n\n\"You could virtually fry an egg on those,\" Peters says. \"These green roofs just give you less of a load for the air-conditioning system to have to shoulder, and they reduce the heat island effect common in urban areas.\"\n\nWhen Pruitt and Peters first began their green roof research, they agreed that all of the data that is collected would be public information \u2014 a stance that hasn't changed.\n\n\"It's not proprietary,\" Pruitt says. \"We believe as a state institution and an educational and research facility, we should be pushing this information out to everybody in our community and the rest of the state. When we first started, there was no information on green roofs and how they would do in our area. The research we've done so far has been very, very positive, and it's helped us set our standards at UAB going forward. Now, our standard here at UAB is that if we don't do a vegetative roof, we go to a white reflective roof. We hope to eventually create a standard and if we can prove the return on investment long-term, hopefully we can get our standards set up to where that becomes the way of the future.\"\n\nThe Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) has visited and inspected the green vegetative roofs and is very interested in promoting them to encourage vegetative roofs across the state. ADEM has been very supportive of UAB's research in green roof design. The School of Engineering has received two research grants from the Alabama Water Resources Research Institute (AWRRI) to study the hydrology and water quality aspects of vegetative roofs. The research efforts have produced very promising results. As a result, plans to build a new vegetative roof on the BEC are under way.\n\nPrice also regularly gives tours to garden clubs, industry professionals, and even classes from other institutions around the state, including a landscape architecture class from Auburn University."}

The findings were published in the Environmental Health Perspectives.

What we have shown definitively is that these levels are already having an effect on pregnant mothers.\"\n\nThe Newcastle University researchers utilized records that spanned fifty years of the city's history. They allowed for the socio-economic status and occupation, and were able to correlate the number of particles in the outdoor air to the birth weight of the children. The description of \"low birth weight\" is defined by a child being less than five pounds, eight ounces, or 2,500 grams.\n\nProfessor Pless-Mulloli added: \"The particles which are affecting pregnant mothers mainly come from the burning of fossil fuels. In the past the culprit may have been coal fires, now it is primarily vehicle fumes.\n\n\"Currently in some parts of London we see around 40 units of particulate air pollution and in Newcastle it is around 20 units but going back to the 1960's we saw around 700 units of air pollution.

The result is that Linfen, once ranked last on SEPA's Environmental Monitoring List, is now 29th of 113 cities in terms of water and air quality(6).\nClearly Linfen is no longer the world's most polluted city, nor even the most polluted in China.\nFor the full response (with citations\/photos), please see: \nSincerely,\nDeliang Tang, MD, DrPH\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Environmental Health Sciences\nMailman School of Public Health\nColumbia University\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nIt's been over a year since the US military installation burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan were a trendy story. When I was in Balad, in 2006 - 2007, the smoke plume sometimes contained tiny black shreds that floated gently down on us, turning into oily droplets when they contacted our skin, and instantly sinking in, leaving a tiny black smudge. We wore gloves and glasses and tried really hard not to get the stuff on our skin. The Army assured us there was nothing but inert dust particulates in the smoke plume ... we googled the combustion products of the plastics that were burned in huge heaps every day, and we knew differently. Water bottles, meal trays, plastic flatware enough to feed and water several thousand people a day, heavy plastic shrink-wrap from freight pallets, it all went into the smoldering pit along with an assortment of every kind of discarded material one could imagine, including medical waste from the hospital.\n\nWe didn't like to complain - after all, compared to the shattered and burned troops the Blackhawks delivered to the hospital all day and night, what was a little greasy smoke? But now the long-term effects are showing. Do a search for Balad burn pit, or Iraq or Afghanistan burn pits. Read the stories. Most polluted? And Balad, Iraq is not on the list?\n\n\"What potions have I drunk of siren's tears\nDistilled from limbecks foul as hell within!\"\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nVery interesting to see London here.

This is unacceptable anywhere in the world, but for this to be the case in an advanced industrialised democracy is unbelievable. Our organisation, ClientEarth, a group of activist environmental lawyers, is working on a solution to the city's unacceptable air pollution. We're based in London ourselves, so we know first-hand how bad it is.\n\nAt the moment there are up to 8000 premature deaths within London caused by illegal levels of particulate matter in the air, which causes heart and lung related illnesses. The amount of nitrogen oxide also exceeds legal levels set by the EU (who base their safety limits on World Health Organisation recommendations) all across central London and the city's busiest roads. This is also affecting the health of our children, making asthma worse and retarding lung development.\n\nThe mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has released an Air Quality Strategy, but its recommendations are too weak to significantly improve pollution in a quick enough period, leaving millions of Londoners and visitors to suffer in the mean time.\n\nClientEarth is leading a campaign for the mayor to improve air quality across the city and challenging him using European law, which is currently being breached. You can follow us on Facebook or look at website: \n\nClientEarth: The air quality in London is truly terrible, and dangerous.\n\nEverything you stated is true. What amazes me is all this is going on AFTER Europes Cap & Trade has been called a success. Guess the only real winners are the Carbon exchanges that made hundreds of billions in profits.

{"text":"How to Recognize Marketing Ploys & Choose the Right Air Purifier\n\nACH stands for Air Changes per Hour, and it is arguably the most important and least understood factor in air purification.\n\nAn ACH rating tells us how many times an air purifier filters all of the air in a given room during one hour. An ACH rating of four, for example, means\nthat the air purifier cleans the room's full volume of air four times per hour.\n\nThe effectiveness of an air purifier is directly related to its ACH rating. The more air changes per hour, the more effective the filter is.\n\nBut before you can calculate the ACH, you must know the Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) for the air purifier in question.\n\nClean Air Delivery Rate & AHAM\n\nSome air purifiers have CADR ratings that have been certified by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM). Such air purifiers display CADR\nseals that look like this:\n\nNote that an air purifier's CADR may be different for different particles. For instance, according to AHAM, the CADR for\nthe\nBlueair 403 air purifier is 250 for dust, 240 for tobacco smoke, and 255 for\npollen. The recommended room size is 365 square feet.\n\nIt's important to know that AHAM works under the assumption that all rooms have ceiling heights of eight feet. Also, all of AHAM's room size\nrecommendations are based on the CADR for tobacco smoke.\n\nThe Math Behind ACH\n\nAn air purifier's ACH is calculated by dividing a room's volume by the air\npurifiers' CADR, then dividing that result into 60.\n\nIn the Blueair 402 example above, if we assume that the 365 square-foot room has a ceiling height of eight feet, then we can calculate the air\npurifier's ACH for tobacco smoke:\n\n365 square feet x 8 feet = 2,920 cubic feet;\n\n2,920 cubic feet \/ 240 cubic feet per minute = 12 minutes;\n\n60 minutes \/ 12 minutes = 5 ACH.\n\nSo, when it comes to tobacco smoke, the Blueair 402 air purifier provides five air changes per hour in a 365 square foot room (assuming that the\nceilings are 8 feet high). Under normal circumstances, this ACH rating would be sufficient for someone who has allergies or asthma.\n\nACH Recommendation for Allergy & Asthma Sufferers\n\nWe recommend a minimum of four air changes per hour for allergy sufferers, and all room size recommendations\nat AchooAllergy.com are based on an ACH rating of four.\n\nA minimum ACH rating of four is also recommended by ASHRAE (The\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) for patient rooms in hospitals. ASHRAE recommends a minimum ACH of six for intensive care\nunits and a minimum ACH of 25 for operating rooms.\n\nHow to Recognize Marketing Ploys\n\nMany retailers list the recommended room size based on an ACH of two, and their customers often end up with air purifiers which cannot effectively remove allergens\nfrom the air in the room.\n\nOther retailers list the recommended room size based on an ACH of six, and their customers often end up paying more money for a large air purifier when a smaller\nmodel would have worked just fine.\n\nAll room size recommendations at\nAchooAllergy.com are based on an ACH rating of four. We want to make it easy for you to\nchoose the right air purifier for your home.\n\nA Word about Ozone\n\nUnfortunately, many stores and catalogs offer air cleaners that emit ozone, which is a dangerous lung irritant that can cause asthma attacks. If the word \"ionic\" is\nused to describe an air cleaner, then it most likely produces ozone. To learn more about ozone, see Ozone: A Powerful\nLung Irritant."}
{"text":"This tool specifically concentrates on the human health effects of major\npollutants. It is intended to assist the Working Groups in understanding\nthe danger of each pollutant, identifying and prioritizing hazardous pollutants\nwithin their own cities, and initiating actions to curb them\n\nWhile there are many pollutants, it is generally sufficient to focus\nair quality management on the major pollutants mentioned in the Table\nbelow. Some of these pollutants cause acute health effects after short\nor longterm exposure while others have chronic effects after long (chronic)\nperiods of exposure.\n\nAcute effects occur when the concentration of a pollutant is above the\nprescribed level for a short period of time. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a\nwell-known example of a pollutant that causes acute effects. It reduces\nthe oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. People may immediately die\nwhen exposed to very high CO concentrations. High CO concentrations can\noccur in isolated rooms with badly maintained gas heaters. The one-hour,\nmean concentrations of pollutants (that cause acute effects) should not\nexceed prescribed levels. If information on hourly concentrations is not\navailable, the information on the 24-hour mean or the 8-hour mean concentrations\ncould suffice.\n\nIn case of pollutants causing long-term effects (such as cancer or asthma),\nannual mean concentrations should not exceed the prescribed levels. These\nlevels can be found in the WHO air quality standards TOOL\n6. Dust (SPM) is a classic example of a pollutant with long-term effects.\nIt affects human health in the most serious way because it causes breathing\nproblems and asthma. The extent of illnesses depends upon the size and\nchemical composition of the particulate matter. The smallest particles\nare the worst because they are the inhalable, thoracic fraction of SPM.\nThis fraction is called the PM 10 fraction, meaning that the particles\nare 10 micrometre or less in diameter. In practice, dust emitted by diesel\nmotor vehicles is worse than the same amount of dust from the desert,\nbecause diesel emissions contain a large percentage of small particles.\nAlone in Europe, particulate matter is estimated to cause more then 200'000\ndeaths per year.\n\nTable 7.1 Human Health Effects of Pollutants\n\nPollutant\n\nHuman Health Effects\n\nOther Effects\n\nCarbon Monoxide\n\nReduces oxygen carrying capacity of the blood by combining with\nhemoglobin.

These systems have benefits and drawbacks. Lately, there has been some controversy over their safety. Some consider them to be unsafe, while others swear by the results.\n\nHow a Filterless Air Purifiers Work\n\nA filterless purifier works by giving the incoming air an electrostatic charge. This charge also charges particles in the air. The air is then moved past an oppositely charged collection grid. The impurities in the air are attracted to the grid, like a magnet. The grid must be removed periodically and cleaned of the impurities. This is easily done with a damp cloth. Once the grid is completely dry, replace it and turn the machine back on..."}
{"text":"EcoVision Report to Citizens\n\nThe EcoVision Annual Report 2009 is the City's report card to citizens about our environmental programs. The report looks at programs in the categories of Air, Climate, Land, Water and Environmental Management and evaluates the current state of each program and the challenges they face.\n\nHistorically, the environmental management of emissions has focused on continual improvement of emissions control technologies both for industrial facilities and vehicles. As a result of improving pollution control technologies, we have seen generally good air quality in the Edmonton region for the past 15 years. This improvement has occurred even though the number of cars on the road has increased and additional industrial facilities have been constructed.\n\nEdmonton's air quality has improved significantly since the 1970s. The number of \"good\" air quality hours in 2009 slightly increased over 2008 from 96.19% to 96.51% but remains slightly below the provincial target of 97%. In general, the majority of days with poor air quality involved particulate matter and can largely be attributed to temperature inversions during the winter months. However, the September grass fire in Lamont also contributed particulate matter-induced poor air quality in Edmonton in 2009.\n\nAir Quality Index - Edmonton\n\n2004 % of hours\n\n2005 % of hours\n\n2006 % of hours\n\n2007 % of hours\n\n2008 % of hours\n\n2009 % of hours\n\nGood\n\n97. 26\n\n99. 31\n\n96. 77\n\n97. 51\n\n96.15\n\n96.46\n\nFair\n\n2. 69\n\n0. 69\n\n3. 18\n\n2. 47\n\n3.81\n\n3.47\n\nPoor\n\n0. 04\n\n0.00\n\n0. 05\n\n0. 02\n\n0.04\n\n0.07\n\nVery\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n0\n\nHow are we protecting our air?\n\nOzone Management Plan: The City of Edmonton is participating, through the Alberta Capital Airshed Alliance, in an exercise to evaluate the ambient air quality network. The work is expected to be completed by the end of 2010.\n\nIdle Control Education Campaign: Be Idle Free: A Minute or Less is Best is a new City program encouraging Edmonton motorists to turn off their car's engine if they sit idle for more than one minute, except in traffic. Messaging and graphics were developed based on the Province of Alberta's Idle Free Schools educational program; downloadable posters and brochures were created and made available on the City website; and messaging and information were distributed to the Community Services department to include in various community newsletters.\n\nFuel Sense Training: In 2009, 94 municipal fleet drivers and 226 bus drivers received Fuel Sense training. This training is now mandatory for all employees that drive on a regular basis for the City. In 2009, Transit Inspectors conducted checks throughout the city to monitor bus operator compliance to the Idle Control Work Procedure. A total of 2,141 buses were monitored citywide. Overall, 81.9% of buses met the idle control criteria. This is an improvement from 2008 numbers which indicated a compliance rate of 47%.\n\nBuses: Over 2009, 48 older General Motors (GMC) buses were retired and replaced with low-emission New Flyer clean diesel buses. The staged retirement of the older GMC buses in 2009 resulted in an estimated reduction of 1.8 tonnes of NOx and 0.43 tonnes of PM.\n\nFleet Management: In 2009, 47 municipal fleet vehicles were replaced with newer models. Monitoring fleet turnover by age and engine class can provide valuable information on how quickly emissions reductions are being realized and if projections of reductions in emissions are on track. As the municipal fleet continues to expand with the growing City, the number of units required and kilometres travelled will continue to increase making absolute emissions reductions more of a challenge.\n\nUnderstanding the opportunities and limits of low-carbon energy systems that can meet the needs of Edmontonians while mitigating anthropogenic emissions that contribute to climate change is important to Edmonton's sustainability. The future supply and distribution of fossil fuels as well as the commitments to reduce CO2 both suggest the future will be carbon constrained. The connections between energy and climate change are undeniable and gaining an understanding of the future sources and availability of energy is extremely important.\n\nThe City is approaching the challenge of climate change by implementing strategies in both City operations and the community that focus on the mitigation and management of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nHow are we addressing climate change?\n\nMeasurable Community GHG emissions: Community GHG emissions were reduced by 5,169 tonnes in 2009 through CO2RE initiatives including high-efficiency furnace rebates, New Home Builders rebates for Built Green\u2122 Gold certified homes and low-income households' high-efficiency furnace rebates.\n\nGo Green! It's Our Nature: Residents were asked to take two new actions to reduce their environmental footprint by June 2009. Two new tools were developed:\n\nZerofootprint Edmonton calculator: an online calculator that allows people to measure their impact in five key areas (travel, yard, energy, water and waste)\n\nEarth Hour: On March 28, Edmonton joined 8,000 other cities around the world by participating in Earth Hour, a global lights out movement. Participation by citizens increased significantly over the previous year and EPCOR reported a 5.1% reduction in power use across the city.\n\nICLEI Community Programmes: Four community programs took place during ICLEI, each highlighting the importance of environmental awareness. The programs were: Voices of Nature, a musical performance by local school children; Gone Green, an art exhibit featuring works made using reclaimed and recycled materials; Lights Down Stars Up photography exhibit highlighting Edmonton's night sky; and That's Edmonton For You, a concert in Louise McKinney Park featuring original music on the subject of community sustainability performed by local musicians.\n\nSustainable Fleet Management Plan: Fleet Services developed a Sustainable Fleet Management Plan in early 2009. The content was reviewed by the Senior Management Team in 2009 and a Light Duty Vehicle Administrative Directive was established to consider right sizing factors and more fuel efficient vehicles such as hybrids as part of the procurement process. It is estimated that a reduction of 54 TCO2e are attributable to these efforts in 2009.\n\nLRT Expansion: Edmonton Transit LRT opened the Belgravia\/McKernan and South Campus stations in 2009, contributing to an increase of 20,000 passengers per day on the LRT system. The continued LRT expansion south to Southgate and Century Park stations in 2010 will provide further incentive for people in the newly-serviced areas to consider transit as a viable alternative to driving during rush hour.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nGet an ecoENERGY audit and make your home as energy efficient as it can be.\n\nInstall compact fluorescent light bulbs, which use 75% less energy and last 10 times longer.\n\nBuy local food and products to reduce your footprint and help sustain local businesses.\n\nWash in cold water and avoid using your dryer to reduce your carbon footprint as much as 250 kg a year.\n\nOther Links\n\nNature is intrinsically connected to a healthy urban environment as it provides ecological services such as flood control, climate moderation, and pollination. However, many of our citizens are not aware of this connection. The City and its partners are finding new ways to engage the community to understand the importance of biodiversity and ways to integrate biodiversity considerations into decision-making processes.\n\nAlthough the City of Edmonton is contributing significant resources to secure Edmonton's last remaining important natural areas (perhaps more than any city in Canada), it continues to experience significant losses of natural areas as new residents move to Edmonton in unprecedented numbers. These growth pressures cannot be underestimated when managing urban natural areas.\n\nWaste Management In 2009, a per person decrease of 7.5% and a 7.0% in total residential waste collected was seen compared to 2008. The decreases continued a trend that began in 2008 which saw a 7% per capita decrease and 2% reduction in the total residential waste collected when compared to 2007. Another positive trend over the past decade has been the increase in recycling as a proportion of the total residential waste stream. Between 1997 and 2009, residential waste collected increased from 11.9% to 19% recyclable material.\n\nUrban Development From 2003 to 2009, the city's built area increased 13.6% in size, while its population increased 11.9%. Looking solely at the density of residential land (i.e., city population divided by the sum of residential zoned hectares and direct control hectares), density decreased from 35.6 persons per hectare in 2003 to 34.2 persons per hectare in 2009. Given these figures, the objective of intensification of residential development was not met during this period.\n\nTransportation Over the course of 2009, the City of Edmonton completed a number of major policy initiatives that set the direction for Edmonton to become a sustainable, urban city. As a result, over the next few years Edmonton will begin to see significant infrastructure investments targeted toward providing more travel options to citizens. These investments will include an expanded LRT system as well as an expanded and better connected network of walking and cycling facilities. These investments will provide the support necessary to enable a change in the mode split.\n\nNatural Areas Natural areas are being converted to other land uses at an increasing pace. In 2009 alone, 50 ha of Edmonton's most important natural areas were lost forever. In recognition of the importance and urgency to accelerate the conservation of nature, City Council passed a $20 million borrowing initiative in 2009 so that another 100 ha of higher biodiversity natural areas can be conserved before they are lost.\n\nContaminated Lands Although all five applicant spots were filled in 2006, the program has yet to provide funding to any of the participants. As of December 2009, only two participants formally remained in the program. The grant program is being evaluated and a \"lessons learned\" approach will be applied when developing future brownfield programs.\n\nToxic Substances In 2009, steps were taken to evaluate and either eliminate or reduce products used in City operations that contain toxic or hazardous components that can be dispersed into the environment. Several branches introduced procedures and\/or environmental programs with the objective to 1) purchase products that are environmentally sound and\/or 2) replace existing products with more environmentally friendly products.\n\nAlso in 2009, the City of Edmonton developed a Sustainable Purchasing Policy (SPP) that provides a framework for purchasing that can be systematically applied across business units. The SPP is expected to incorporate toxics reduction into its criteria as it is phased in over time.\n\nPesticides Pesticides have the potential to act as environmental toxins. Impacts are largely determined by a pesticide's mode of action or intended method of attack. Over the past decade, the City has moved away from broadcast turf herbicide spraying to spot spraying of weeds. In 2008, City pesticide use reached its lowest level of use in sixteen years.\n\nHow are we protecting land?\n\nBiofuels Facility: Environmental permits were received in 2009 and construction will begin in 2010. The facility will be built by Enerkem Greenfield Alberta Biofuels. This facility will enable the City to divert more than 90% of residential waste from the landfill.\n\nElectronic Waste Recycling: In 2009, 12,250 tonnes of e-waste was recycled at this facility, located at the EWMC.\n\nSand Recycling: During winter 2008\/09, Transportation Operations Branch spread 160,000 tonnes of sand on city streets. Approximately 85,000 tonnes were recovered for reuse.\n\nNeighbourhood Commercial Revitalization Program: Under the Smart Choices umbrella, this program will be initiated in 2010 to explore further actions to revitalize Edmonton's older neighbourhood commercial centres.\n\nLRT Network Plan: A network plan for LRT was approved by Edmonton City Council in June 2009, and specific alignments for the west and southeast lines were approved in December 2009. In addition, the new Belgravia\/McKernan and South Campus stations on the south LRT line opened in April 2009.\n\nMaster Naturalist Program: The Office of Natural Areas Conservation, with support from other City staff and community experts, completed a pilot run of the Master Naturalist Program with 25 participants. The program provides 35 hours of stewardship training in exchange for 35 hours of volunteer service dedicated to the stewardship of local natural areas. The program will continue in 2010.\n\nContaminated Gas Stations Task Force: In late 2009, City Council initiated the formation of a task force of council. The Committee is made up of five members of City Council. Essentially the task force will oversee and direct the implementation of a plan to encourage site clean up and deter continued inaction on brownfield sites that were historically operating as gas stations.\n\nBiological herbicides: Established two field plots in 2009 to investigate the performance of Sarritor, a new fungal pathogen-based herbicide (mycoherbicide) registered in Canada to control dandelions in turf.\n\nOther Links\n\nConservation EPCOR reports that in 2009 Edmontonians consumed approximately 223 L of water per day while the average Canadian consumed approximately 266 L per day. Comparatively, Edmonton's residential water use is one of the lowest in the country. However, Canada uses more water per person than almost any other country. Although water is considered a renewable resource, pressures on the resource are growing.\n\nPopulation growth in the City of Edmonton and surrounding region will likely continue to increase overall demand for water. This, combined with natural drought pressures, represents a water management challenge.\n\nRiver Water Quality Index (North Saskatchewan River)\n\n96\/97\n\n97\/98\n\n98\/99\n\n99\/00\n\n00\/01\n\n01\/02\n\nUpstream of Edmonton (Devon)\n\n91\n\n97\n\n93\n\n86\n\n90\n\n98\n\nDownstream of Edmonton (Pakan)\n\n66\n\n71\n\n77\n\n81\n\n85\n\n86\n\n02\/03\n\n03\/04\n\n04\/05\n\n05\/06\n\n06\/07\n\n07\/08\n\nUpstream of Edmonton (Devon)\n\n97\n\n98\n\n97\n\n88\n\n98\n\n93\n\nDownstream of Edmonton (Pakan)\n\n90\n\n74\n\n74\n\n79\n\n83\n\n85\n\nLegend\n\nExcellent\n\nGood\n\nFair\n\nMarginal\n\nPoor\n\n96-100\n\n81-95\n\n66-80\n\n46-65\n\n0-45\n\nHow are we protecting our water?\n\nNew slow release tree watering techniques: A cost effectiveness study investigated the use of 600 gator bags and ooze tubes on new tree plantings.\n\nImproved Treatment of Sewer Overflows: Enhanced primary treatment construction was completed at the treatment plant. This facility will provide basic treatment to sewer overflows that would otherwise discharge directly to the river during rainstorms and snowmelt.\n\nReducing Amounts of Mercury from Dental Offices: A bylaw amendment requiring dental offices to install amalgam separators came into effect in 2008. Now 98% of Edmonton dental offices use the separators, collectively preventing 25 kg of mercury from entering the environment each year.\n\nReuse of Pool Water: Approximately 3,000 cubic metres of pool water was dechlorinated and used to irrigate sports fields and parkland.\n\nTree Watering: A study was started to evaluate the benefits of new tree watering methods.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nUse a rain barrel to catch water for plants and\/or toilets, ensuring that overflows are directed away from your foundation.\n\nInstall ENERGY STAR\u00ae rated water-efficient fixtures.\n\nPurchase a low flush toilet when making renovations or purchasing a new home.\n\nShower for no more than five minutes, turning the tap off while soaping.\n\nWash your clothes less; they'll last longer while you save water.\n\nKeep a jug of water in the fridge to cool rather than running excess water from the tap.\n\nKeep chemicals, solid materials and other contaminants out of storm drains or manholes.\n\nDo not wash your car at home, where contaminants flow into the river.\n\nDo not litter or drop cigarette butts on the ground to be washed into the river.\n\nAvoid applying weed killers when rain is in the forecast.\n\nDon't flush unused prescription drugs, personal care products or cleaning chemicals. The wastewater treatment plant cannot remove many of these, and they end up in the river.\n\nReduce or eliminate the use of pesticides and fertilizers where possible."}

There are 100's of them around the Valley.\n\nazriverfan, I don't think PhoenixAirConcerns is trying to sell anything, but rather is looking for products.\n\nI don't agree. A person who was just curious about products would have went to the \"Home\" forum and asked what products were available. They wouldn't be writing long posts about the air quality in Phoenix. After all, if you are looking for an air filter, why would you care what others think about the air quality in Phoenix. You are right, I don't know their specific motivation for posting but I doubt it's to find an air filter. Just my 2 cents\n\nazriverfan - Air quality is a common issue that effects a lot of people in the Phoenix area. If the problem could be reduced down to something as simple as a single air filter, as you described it, I would hope that you would think I could figure that out easily without posting. I don't see what the hostility is about.\n\nThanks for that information. I have been looking for that link for high pollution and ozone alerts.\n\nSure. It's an easier way to get the information on warning days than waiting and watching TV. This is especially helpful if you have a frequent need to know the air condition information. In my case, our doctor has suggested this for our children so they don't exercise outside when it's a warning"}

{"text":"Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in Canada, after smoking. Radon exposure is estimated to be the cause of 10% of lung cancers. The risk of getting lung cancer from radon depends mostly on three factors: the level of radon, the number of years of exposure, and smoking habits. The risks for developing lung cancer from radon exposure are greater for a smoker or someone exposed to second hand smoke.\n\nWe recommend that you test your home for radon, an invisible gas that can cause lung cancer. Radon test kits are available from the Lung Association of Saskatchewan for a cost of $50. The cost also includes the analysis from the Saskatchewan Research Council. These kits are easy to use and your results will be sent to you afterwards. If your home has high radon levels, you can repair it to block the radon.\n\nWhat is radon?\n\nRadon is an invisible, odourless gas that can seep into your home through cracks in floors, walls and foundations. You can't see radon. You can't smell it or taste it. But it may be a problem in your home.\n\nRadon comes from the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water. Radon gas escapes from the ground into the air outside. When radon mixes with the air outside, it's not a problem: the outside air dilutes the amount of radon. But when radon seeps into a closed-in space like a house, it can become trapped inside. You and your family can breathe in high levels of radon, without knowing it. This can be harmful.\n\nHow does radon get into my home?\n\nRadon can come out of the soil and water and seep into cracks and openings in your home, especially on the lower floor, basement, or crawlspace. Radon gas can get into your home through many openings, including:\n\nunfinished floors\n\npipes\n\nwindows\n\nsump pumps\n\ncracks in the basement floor or foundation\n\nRadon can get trapped inside your home, especially in basements and crawlspaces that don't have good ventilation (air movement).\n\nIs radon harmful?\n\nRadon decays quickly, giving off tiny radioactive particles. When inhaled, these radioactive particles can damage the cells that line the lung. Long-term exposure to radon can lead to lung cancer.\n\nHow do I know if there's radon in my home?\n\nThe only way to know if your home has radon is to test for it. You can't see, smell, or taste radon.\n\nRadon can be found all over Canada. There are parts of the country that tend to have more radon, and parts that tend to have less. A recent study by the Regina-Qu'Appelle Health Region conducted in 106 Regina homes at random, found 38 homes had radon levels higher Health Canada's recommended guidelines. It's impossible to know how much radon there is in your home unless you test for it. That's why everyone should test their home for radon.\n\nHow do I test my home for radon?\n\nThe Lung Association of Saskatchewan is now thrilled to announce that for $50, you can purchase a Radon kit from us, and the purchase price also includes the analysis! We are working in collaboration with the Saskatchewan Research Council who will analyse the Radon kits here in our home province! The kits can be ordered by calling the Lung Association of Saskatchewan at 1-306-343-9511, or by email info@sk.lung.ca.\n\nWhen should I test for radon?\n\nIt's best to test for radon over the winter months, when there is less ventilation (less air movement) in your home. Test kits sold by the Lung Association of Saskatchewan are designed to test over a three month period, as per Health Canada's recommendations.\n\nWhat do I do if the test results show that I have radon in my home?\n\nWhat you do depends on how much radon there is. Radon is measured in Becquerel's per cubic metre (Bq\/m3).\n\nIf your home's radon level is between 200 and 600 Bq\/m3, you should repair your home in the next two years.\n\nIf your home's radon level is over 600 Bq\/m3, you should repair your home within one year.\n\nHow do I repair my home to lower its level of radon?\n\nRadon can come into your home through: sump pumps, cracks in foundations, spaces around pipes, unfinished floors, and other places. To solve your radon problem, you need an expert to find out where exactly the radon is getting in. A trained contractor with experience in radon mitigation (radon repairs) can examine your home, find where the radon is seeping in, and make the necessary repairs.\n\nRepairs may include actions such as:\n\nPainting basement floors and walls. Use a sealant on top of the paint and add polyethylene sheets to basement walls.\n\nSealing all cracks and openings in the walls, floors and drains and pipes of your basement.\n\nIf your basement floor has a sub-floor, make sure it is ventilated.\n\nReplacing an earth floor with a concrete floor.\n\nIncreasing the ventilation in your basement or other enclosed space where radon may accumulate.\n\nIn extremely rare cases where there is a high level of uranium in the soil around your house, the soil should be removed and replaced with clean fill, if possible.\n\nWho should I hire to repair my home to lower the radon level?\n\nYou should hire an experienced, reputable contractor to repair your home. Right now, there is no certification program in Canada for radon mitigation (repair) contractors. Health Canada is planning one, but it's hasn't been developed yet. In the meantime, Health Canada recognizes the certification programs offered in the United States through either the National Environmental Health Association or the National Radon Safety Board. Both organizations operate a certification program for contractors who offer radon measurement and mitigation services to the public. Health Canada encourages Canadians to use a contractor who is certified by one of these programs."}

{"text":"Up here, atop Beetle Rock, a precipice more than one mile high in the Sierra, air at dawn is clear, invisible, exactly as it should be. Two mule deer bucks in velvet saunter through the forest, and a sow bear and cub scratch out bugs from a big tree near Giant Grove.\n\nDown below, 30 miles away in the San Joaquin Valley, sunrise illuminates haze like a flashlight shot through tea. The smear of smog spreads wide over Central California, constrained only by the horizon and a tabletop-flat layer of warm air called an inversion that holds a brownish haze low to valley farms and cities and highways. For now, at least, the high country is untouched.\nFOR THE RECORD: Park smog \u2014A map with an article in last week's section about smog in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks transposed the names of the parks. Sequoia National Park is south of Kings Canyon National Park.\nYet as the sun climbs, California heats up; people awaken, start their machines and pump tons of emissions into the sky. The air pollution, stratified over Visalia like the layers of a cake, begins to cook and mix and expand. The ozone gauge at Beetle Rock starts ticking upwards from .066 part per million and will soon climb toward the unhealthful mark. The smog is coming.\n\nWith little fanfare, Sequoia-Kings Canyon has become America's smoggiest national park. The mountains that John Muir once described as \"not clothed with light, but wholly composed of it\" have on many summer days the clarity of miso soup. Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree and Great Smoky Mountains national parks get plenty of bad press for their air quality, but Sequoia-Kings Canyon would be fortunate if it had similar conditions. The pollution in Sequoia is less severe than in the Los Angeles basin, but there are more smoggy days here than in Atlanta or New York City.\n\nThe main culprits are ozone and haze, air pollution's most potent ingredients. Ozone is a toxic, colorless gas and a powerful lung irritant. It forms when hydrocarbons from solvents, petroleum and paint mix with sunlight. Most of the haze comes from dust and smoke from diesel exhaust, tilled cropland, road grit and fires.\n\nOver the past few years, ozone at Sequoia for an average of 56 days annually has exceeded the national clean-air benchmark established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Stated more explicitly, ozone reaches or exceeds the standard of .08 ppm eight hours a day, one day out of six during the year. It is a level that is harmful for human health, and it is anathema to the aesthetics of a national park. On clear days you can see 100 miles from Beetle Rock, but park officials say visibility on the worst summer days is less than 10 miles.\n\n\"Smog?\" asks day-hiker Jay Emmer of New York on an ascent of nearby Moro Rock. \"We just thought it was a natural blue haze. I told my wife we needed a filter for the camera.\"\n\n*\n\nWatching the decline\n\nAIR pollution has dogged Annie Esperanza since she was a little girl growing up in Porterville, and that was some 40 years ago. Over time she has watched San Joaquin Valley air turn ugly as homes, highways and farms spread. After earning her natural resources management degree from Humboldt State University, she came to Sequoia-Kings Canyon, where for the past 23 years she has run the park's air pollution program.\n\n\"When you go to a national park, you think it's clean and pristine and has good air, but it's not. People are surprised, but people should be shocked and appalled at the air quality here. I don't think they're mad enough about it,\" Esperanza says.\n\nOne day during the summer while hiking near Giant Forest, scouting for an air pollution monitoring site, she found herself short of breath and began coughing and trying to clear her lungs. Fluid was filling her bronchial cavities \u2014 a classic symptom of congestive heart failure. She managed to walk out, then went home. A doctor diagnosed her with a rare heart disease. Today, a pacemaker, internal defibrillator and mechanical valve inside her chest keep her on track. She still suffers shortness of breath and fatigue on smoggy days, forcing her to stay in her office at park headquarters.\n\nSmog in Sequoia has not only affected Esperanza's life, but it has also forced the park to conduct its business differently.\n\nJob postings at Sequoia-Kings Canyon come with a generic disclaimer (\"The Central Valley and Sierra Nevada Mountains of California may pose human health problems due to air pollution\"). A recent listing for a forestry technician is more blunt: \" during summer months, air quality in Sequoia-Kings Canyon occasionally reaches unhealthy levels.\"\n\nAdvisories such as these have put a crimp in hiring. \"There are people who won't come here because they are worried about the air quality problem,\" Esperanza says.\n\nAdditionally, the park service has curtailed some guided tours to avoid smog, which is worst during afternoons and evenings. The park-sponsored tours to the top of Moro Rock, a hulking granite knob 6,700 feet high with a commanding view of the Kaweah River gorge and the Central Valley, are conducted before 11 a.m. to avoid exposing visitors to the unhealthy air \u2014 and the diminished views. On Independence Day, park employees used to scale Moro Rock to watch fireworks over Visalia and Fresno, but haze snuffed out the aerial displays and an annual tradition, says Bill Tweed, chief naturalist for Sequoia-Kings Canyon.\n\nIn the rugged Sequoia backcountry, ranger and emergency medical technician Nate Inouye says he treats more people with respiratory problems than he did at his previous postings in Yosemite, Lassen, Bryce Canyon and Dinosaur national parks. \"We have a lot of people with complaints of difficulty breathing,\" he"}

{"text":"We've all been gagging over the Wasatch Front's dirty and dangerous air. We all, and especially Utah's political leaders, wish easy solutions could be found.\n\nSome of the angry people rallying at the Capitol, speaking to reporters, and posting on Social Media, make it sound simple: Leaders must act! Someone, somehow, must clean up this rotten air!\n\nThey have suggested solutions: make public transit free, shut down the refineries, shut down Rio Tinto, reduce freeway speed limits. While well-meaning, in some ways they are na\u00efve and unrealistic. The reality is that given Utah's geography, a million little acts create bad air during an inversion, and it will require a million little acts to achieve cleaner air.\n\nEvery time you and I drive down the road, watch TV, send a Tweet, take a hot shower, or keep our home warm, we're contributing to dirty air. That's reality. Those are all small actions, but a couple of million people living ordinary lives create considerable pollution. When all that stuff gets stuck under an inversion with snow on the ground, dirty air follows.\n\nCertainly, we can do better. Free public transit is a fine idea, but it would cost Utah Transit Authority hundreds of thousands of dollars and the price would have to be made up somehow, with higher fares at other times (which would completely defeat the purpose), or a legislative subsidy, where funding would compete with every other state need, like education and health care.\n\nWe could shut down certain industries and achieve minor progress, but would that be fair to employees and their families who don't get a pay check? Or to customers and suppliers who would be hurt? If we close refineries for several weeks, is everyone OK paying higher gas prices?\n\nIndustry must do its part, but no painless silver bullet exists. And the problem hasn't reached such a crisis point that very many people are willing to sacrifice. If someone else suffers, fine. But if it requires personal inconvenience (walking, taking public transit, turning down my furnace, using less electricity, etc., etc., we're not there yet.\n\nI had to smile over a newspaper opinion piece written by a clean air activist who blasted the governor for \"lack of leadership.\" She asked when the governor and his staff have taken public transit or driven hybrids or CNG vehicles, and if they walk to work.\n\nThen she said she loves public transportation \"when it is user-friendly.\" But it's too inconvenient for her to use.\n\nWell, solving this problem isn't going to be convenient \u2013 for anyone. If even a gung-ho activist who is criticizing everyone else won't endure a little inconvenience to take public transit, then not many people are willing to do what it takes. Another group of activists held a meeting to complain about dirty air and most of them drove cars -- thus making the air worse. Had they never heard of getting together on a big conference call, or webinar?\n\nAre we willing to do the hard things to clean up the air? Probably not. Our air is just fine most of the time. In fact, Wasatch Front air quality, overall, has improved significantly over the last few decades.\n\nDirty air is akin to traffic accidents. As a society we put up with more than 32,000 vehicle traffic fatalities each year in this country, with more than 2 million injuries, some of them horrible. We seem to accept the deaths and the injuries as part of modern life. We could end all that tragedy if we were willing to pay enough and sacrifice enough. We could also have clean air if we were willing to pay enough and sacrifice enough.\n\nUtah can afford to make public transit free on bad air days. What's the alternative for a state that claims to value its children? There is growing evidence that air pollution has serious effects on developing fetuses--increases in autism, low birth weight, miscarriages. It's been linked to increased rates of dementia in older adults. And as I'm sure you know, it complicates all sorts of heart and lung ailments. All these things cost Utah lots of money.\n\nNot that people will necessarily use transit, but it's pretty hard to justify paying an extra $23 a week and the inconvenience of TRAX when you're already paying for a car. Free passes would create some public pressure to at least think of using an alternative. Also, I don't think you shut down industry, but there must be ways to tighten regulations. And my family has chosen to live in the city near Trax so that biking and public transit are easier. That said, it's much harder now that we have a kid to tote to daycare. So yeah, we're all to blame, but that doesn't mean we just accept that our kids will have reduced lung capacity by the time they're 18. I think we create public pressure--on government and on citizens--to make changes.\n\nAt what point in this discussion of air pollution will the subject of timing street lights be addressed? Cars idling at street lights because they aren't time is one of the biggest contributors to the pollution. Engines idling produce more pollution than engines operating at the higher RPMs of normal driving.\n\nI live off Wasatch Blvd and drive between 45th south and 33rd south. There are 5 street lights over that distance that are not timed. There are no good reasons that they can't be timed.\n\nOver 15 years ago cabling was installed in the valley to time lights but because the entities of city, county and state can't work together the idling cars at lights continue to add large quantities of pollution.\n\nRobert Mueller a PHD in physics at Cal Berkeley and on many physic advisory groups has written several books that address different means of powering vehicles and their issues. Two of those books are \"Physics for Future Presidents\" and \"Energy for Future Presidents.\" He also addresses radon gas.\n\nI agree that the majority of our pollution problem comes from individual citizens who, if they would make even small adjustments to their lives, could collectively make a difference. For example, I chose to live and work downtown and ride my bike instead of driving (but only on warm days of course). I realize this isn't possible for everyone, but I don't think shutting down refineries etc. is a viable option, although I do believe they should be held to the highest pollution standards. One thing I do think could make a difference is making the speed limits along the Wasatch Front 55 MPH on red air days. This could directly reduce pollution as cars will be operating at a more efficient speed, but it might also have a psychological impact by reminding people what a serious situation this is. If people have to reduce their speed on the freeway, they might remember to make other minor adjustments as well throughout the day."}

Even exterior appliances such\nas charcoal and gas grills, stand-by electric generators and automobiles\ncan be a potential source of Carbon Monoxide inside your home.\n\nCommonly called\nthe \"silent\" or \"invisible\" killer, Carbon Monoxide is an\nodorless, colorless and tasteless gas.

Long-term health effects can include tissue and\nneurological damage, and in high enough concentrations and exposures, death. Each year in the United States, CO\npoisoning claims hundreds of lives, and several thousand more\nvictims require medical attention. Numerous other untold victims\nare poisoned but do not realize it because of the undetectable\nnature of CO, and how the symptoms of CO poisoning mimic other\nailments such as the flu.\n\nSome groups such\nas neonates, infants, and people with chronic heart disease,\nanemia and respiratory problems are more susceptible to the\neffects of CO poisoning.

In addition, because of Carbon Monoxide's ability to bind\nto hemoglobin, CO is slow to be expelled from the body, making\nit a very serious health threat.\n\nOn this page, we\nwill discuss how to prevent Carbon Monoxide problems, Carbon\nMonoxide alarms, and what to do if a\nCarbon Monoxide incident arises.\n\nFuel-burning appliances such as furnaces and hot\nwater heaters might produce Carbon Monoxide if not\nserviced appropriately.\n\nMany homes now\nfeature very efficient insulation, doors and windows which keeps\nair from getting in, and out. This obviously means that should\nyou get Carbon Monoxide in your home, it will have a difficult time exiting\nnaturally. This same air-tight condition can also help produce\nCarbon Monoxide, as a flame that has less than adequate oxygen\nfor combustion will produce CO. A good first step in helping to\nprevent a CO problem in your home is to have a qualified\ntechnician annually inspect and maintain all fuel burning\nappliances, and their ventilation systems, irregardless of if they\nare gas or oil-fired.\n\nWhen neglected,\ngas and oil-fired appliances such as furnaces, boilers, hot water heaters,\nclothes dryers, cook tops, ovens, gas fireplaces and their\nassociated ventilation systems are prime sources for Carbon Monoxide. In\naddition, their inefficiency resulting from needed maintenance costs you money and in\nthe case of fuel oil furnaces, can lead to \"backfires\" that will\nleave your house filled with a greasy, black smoke which stains\nwalls, ceilings and other parts of your interior. Be sure to\nhave these systems serviced annually by a qualified technician.\n\nProper\ninstallation and maintenance of all ventilation\nsystems is critical. This includes all rigid and\nflexible duct work, chimneys and exterior vents.\n\nIt is also very important to\nmake sure that all exhaust is being properly vented to prevent\nCO from finding it's way into your home. Both rigid and flexible\nductwork which is used to vent these appliances is prone to\ndislodgement and damage. Repairing ductwork may seem\nlike an easy enough task for a do-it-your-self'er, but be\nwarned, making a mistake here could be deadly. Be sure to ask\nthe technician servicing your appliances to also inspect their\nventilation systems.\n\nRemember, duct\nwork from wood, coal and pellet stoves should also be installed\nand maintained by a professional. Fireplace doors and fireplace\ninserts will also allow CO into the home if they are not\ninstalled correctly.\n\nHomeowners would\nalso be advised to leave the repair and replacement of furnaces,\nboilers, hot water heaters, etc., to a qualified professional. Exterior vents\nfor interior gas and oil appliances must be installed properly.\nIntake and exhaust vents which are placed in proximity to each\nother can re-circulate emissions, introducing Carbon Monoxide to\nthe home instead of safely disposing of it.\n\nWhile we are on\nthe subject, have your chimney inspected and cleaned each year.\nCracks or damage to the chimney flue can serve as an avenue for\nCO to invade your home by. Bird's nests, creosote buildup, and other debris can keep the\nchimney from functioning properly, allowing CO to back-up into\nyour home. In addition, excessive creosote deposits lead to\nchimney fires, so get them cleaned.\n\nKerosene\nheaters have the potential to cause fires and\nproduce carbon monoxide. Always follow the\nmanufacturer's instructions for their use and\nmaintenance.\n\nAnother CO\nproducing appliance that is used for heating is natural gas,\npropane and kerosene space heaters. Some of these heaters are\npermanently installed and require venting to the exterior like\nother heating appliances. All of the maintenance concerns\nassociated with the before mentioned heating appliances also\napplies to space heaters.\n\nPortable space\nheaters normally are not designed to vent to the exterior of your\nhome, although consideration must still be given to ventilation,\nsuch as opening a window partially. Maintenance must be\nperformed on these appliances also, as even an improperly\ntrimmed wick\ncan significantly increase the level of CO produced by these\ntypes of heaters.\n\nAlthough\nmanufacturers certainly design portable gas heaters to be as\nsafe as possible, they are still a potential source for CO and a\nfire hazard. This has led some jurisdictions to ban their use.\nCheck to make sure that the use of these types of heaters are allowed\nin your area, and by all means read, understand and strictly\nfollow the manufacturer's instructions for their use and\nmaintenance.\n\nDuring a winter\npower outage, it is tempting to use outdoor charcoal and gas grills,\nand camping stoves, heaters and lanterns for heating and\nlighting the home. This is an incredibly dangerous practice as\nthese appliances can produce a large amount of Carbon\nMonoxide, and are also considerable fire hazards when used\nindoors. Using your gas oven, range or cook top for heating\nthe home can also produce a significant amount of CO.\n\nAnother warning\nabout power outages:\n\nNever run a portable electric generator\ninside the home, inside THE GARAGE, OR CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE HOME\nOR IN A MANNER THAT MAY ALLOW EXHAUST AND carbon monoxide TO\nENTER.\n\nNever\noperate a portable electric generator inside your\nhome. Position them as far as possible from the\nstructure to help reduce the possibility of\nintroducing Carbon Monoxide to the interior.\n\nThese units are not designed to run inside the\nhome as they produce considerable Carbon Monoxide. There have\nbeen many documented cases of deaths from CO poisoning resulting\nfrom the running of portable electric generators inside the home\nduring power outages, so do not do it. Strictly follow the\nmanufacturer's instructions when using portable electric\ngenerators.\n\nRenters should be\njust as concerned about Carbon Monoxide as homeowners. Speak\nwith your landlord about their preventative measures concerning\nCO. Landlords have a legal obligation to annually service gas\nand oil appliances, and provide renters with a safety certificate\nupon request. Also talk to your landlord about installing a CO\ndetector if none are present, as this is commonly also required by\nlaw.\n\nCarbon Monoxide\ndoesn't always necessarily originate from inside your home.\nCommon sources of CO from the exterior of your home are\nautomobiles, gasoline-powered lawn tools, electric generators, and\ncharcoal and gas grills. CO from these and other sources can\nfind its way from the exterior to the interior of your home,\nand there are several scenarios that you should be aware of.\n\nGarages\ncan trap the exhaust of automobiles, lawn tractors,\nsnow blowers, generators and other fuel burning\nimplements, and facilitate the introduction of the\nCO they produce to the interior of your home. An\nopen garage door does not offer adequate\nventilation. Remove these implements completely from\nyour garage when they are running.\n\nWith many homes\nnow having attached garages, it is not uncommon for CO to\noriginate in the garage, and migrate to inside the home. During\ninclement weather,\nit is a common practice for people to warm-up automobiles,\ntractors, and snow blowers, run portable electric\ngenerators or use grills, inside the garage. What happens is when the door from the garage to the interior is opened,\na large influx of Carbon Monoxide can be introduced to the\ninterior of the home driven by wind or pulled along when colder\nair rushes into the warmer interior of the home.\n\nRemove\nautomobiles, tractors, snowmobiles, etc. from the garage\nimmediately after start-up and idle them outside of the garage,\nand close the doors afterwards to prevent CO from entering the\ngarage while they idle. Start lawn mowers, gasoline-powered tools,\netc., outside and away from the garage and leave them there. Do\nnot use grills or portable electric generators inside the\ngarage. Using any of these items inside the garage, whether it\nis attached to the home or not, is an unsafe practice regardless\nof it you have the garage doors and windows open for\nventilation. The normal circulation of air will not provide\nenough ventilation.\n\nUsing items such\nas grills, lawn tools, pressure washers and electric generators\nin proximity to open windows, doors and vents can certainly also\nintroduce CO to inside your home from the exterior.\n\nEven with\nexcellent preventative measures, a Carbon Monoxide incident can\nstill occur in your home at any time. Unless you have a properly\nfunctioning CO alarm (previously known as CO detectors) installed in your home, it is virtually\nimpossible to determine the presence of Carbon Monoxide.\nRemember, CO is an odorless, colorless, tasteless gas, so a Carbon\nMonoxide alarm is a wise, inexpensive and essential\ninvestment in your family's safety.\n\nCarbon\nMonoxide alarms designed for wall and ceiling\nmounting. The unit on the right is a combination\nCO & smoke alarm.\n\nCarbon Monoxide\nalarms are similar in appearance to smoke alarms and\nprotect you in a similar manner. When functioning properly, they\nconstantly monitor the atmosphere inside your home for the\npresence of CO, emitting a warning when a specified level of\nCarbon Monoxide is detected. It is important to note that while\nsome CO alarms may have a similar appearance to smoke\nalarms, unless the unit is specifically designed to detect\nsmoke in addition to CO, do not utilize it as a smoke alarm.\n\nIn fact, there\nare several brands and designs of CO alarms available. As\nmentioned, some alarms are dual-purpose, working to detect\nCarbon Monoxide and smoke. Some units feature a digital read-out\nof the level of CO in the atmosphere.\n\nThe consumer also\nhas several options regarding how the unit is powered. Battery\noperated units are popular but require the owner to annually\nchange the batteries to keep them in continual operation. Some\nunits are powered by replaceable modules which are good for\nseveral years. The drawback to these alarms is availability\nof the modules. Other units are designed to be plugged into a\nwall outlet or hard-wired directly to a 120 volt connection. If\nyou purchase a wall-plug or hard-wire model, make sure that it has a\nbattery back-up so the alarm continues to function during\npower outages. Never connect a plug-in unit to an outlet, or\ninstall a hard-wired detector to a circuit that is operated by a wall switch. It is imperative that you promptly change the\nbatteries when recommended and\/or needed for those models that use them, regardless\nif the battery is the primary or back-up power source.\n\nMake sure the\nunit you purchase has been approved by an independent testing\ncompany, such as Underwriters Laboratory (UL). Regardless of\nwhich model you purchase, for the unit to effectively protect\nyou and your family, you need to:\n\nFULLY READ AND\nUNDERSTAND THE MANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING THE\nPLACEMENT, MAINTENANCE AND USE OF THE CARBON MONOXIDE ALARMS.\n\nA wall\noutlet plug-in style Carbon Monoxide detector.\n\nMost Carbon\nMonoxide alarms are designed to be mounted on the ceiling or\nwall,\nunless the manufacturer\ninstructs otherwise. The ceiling is a common choice for mounting\nbecause CO is slightly lighter than air, and is\nusually associated with warm air, so it tends to\nrise. In addition, mounting the unit on the ceiling helps to\nkeep it out of reach of tampering, and protects it from\nunintentional damage. However, some literature suggests that CO\nwill distribute relatively evenly from the floor to the ceiling,\nso some manufacturers recommend wall mounting their detector, as they\nmay be designed to work in that configuration. Always follow the\nmanufacturer's recommendations, and avoid placing an alarm in\nareas which the manufacturer warns against. Some of these are\nlisted below. Never paint a CO alarm.\n\nWhere to locate a\nCO alarm(s) depends on the amount of units you decide to\npurchase for your residence. If installing only a single unit,\nthe Consumer\nProduct Safety Commission recommends placing the unit in the\narea outside the bedrooms. This is an excellent recommendation\nfor several reasons. Furnaces, a common source of CO, operate\nmore frequently during the night when people are sleeping.\nDuring a prolonged period of sleep, you will be unaware of the\nonset or worsening of any symptoms, and your ability to awaken\nand be conscious could be significantly degraded because of the\nlong exposure you might suffer unaware during sleep. Depending on the\nlevel of CO poisoning your are suffering, an alarm which is\nsounding distant from where you are sleeping might not be able\nto wake you in your condition.\n\nIf you are going\nto place multiple alarms (which is recommended), there are\nseveral considerations regarding placement, dictated again by\nthe amount of units you are willing to invest in. Consider\nplacing one alarm in each bedroom. One alarm on each floor\nis another good option. It is a good idea to place an alarm in\nthe vicinity of any gas or oil-burning appliances, although one\nalarm on each floor should provide adequate coverage, unless\nyou have a larger-than-average sized home.\n\nThere are\ndefinitely some recommendations on where not to place a unit. Do\nnot place a Carbon Monoxide alarm immediately above or\nadjacent to any fuel-burning appliances. Normal use of these\nappliances is sure to emit some CO into the immediate\natmosphere, even with proper ventilation. In addition, a short\nburst of CO may be produced by these appliances on start-up.\nFollow the manufacturer's suggestions regarding the distance\ntheir alarm should be placed from these appliances.\n\nOther locations\nto avoid placing a CO alarm are:\n\nAreas\nsubject to high humidity such as near showers or saunas.\n\nIn unheated\nbasements, attics, or where they will be directly\nexposed to weather.\n\nWhere they\nmay be exposed to chemical solvents or cleaners, and\naerosols, such as paint thinners, hair and deodorant\nsprays, etc.\n\nNear forced\nor unforced air ventilation openings, flues and\nchimneys, and areas of turbulent air such as ceiling\nfans.\n\nThese situations\ncan greatly increase the chance that your CO alarm will give\nyou false indications, or no alarm when CO is actually present.\n\nAnother situation\nyou should be aware of is any place that is excessively dusty or\ndirty. For example, an unfinished basement probably is not the\ncleanest room in the house, and commonly serves as workshop for\nthe homeowner. Wood dust from sawing and sanding, and airborne\nparticles from spray guns could foul the alarm. These\nconditions are not just limited to the basement. A remodeling\nproject in a bathroom or bedroom might produce dust from drywall\nsanding and airborne particles from a paint sprayer.\n\nThis should not\nkeep you from placing a CO alarm in the basement, and you\nprobably have one somewhere near the bedroom. You just need to\nbe aware that this condition can cause false indications, or ruin the\nalarm. It is highly advised that you temporarily remove\nand protect the CO alarm during a dust condition, and\npromptly reinstall it when the condition has abated.\n\nTesting\nyour unit\nand changing the batteries are essential if you\nexpect your CO detector to protect you.\n\nA few last words\nabout Carbon Monoxide alarms. Like any other device they have\na finite life and must be replaced. Consult the manufacturer's\ninstructions regarding the operative lifespan of your alarm.\nMany alarms have an expiration date printed on them.\n\nDon't forget to\ntest your Carbon Monoxide alarm once a month with the unit's\ntest feature. Do not self-test your unit by trying to produce CO\nwith a cigarette, candle, or other similar manner. Besides the\ndanger the open flame presents, you could very easily damage\nyour unit without even knowing it. Some manufacturers\nrecommend gently vacuuming the alarm periodically.\n\nRemember to replace the\nbatteries at least once a year, or per the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nWhile any Carbon\nMonoxide incident is serious and should be treated as such, the\nrecommended response is dependent upon whether the source of the\nproblem is obvious or not, and if occupants are feeling ill or\nnot. First and foremost:\n\nTREAT EVERY\nACTIVATION OF YOUR CARBON MONOXIDE ALARM AS AN EMERGENCY AND\nNEVER IGNORE AN ACTIVATION OF YOUR ALARM.\n\nShould your CO\nalarm activate, immediately begin to assess the situation.\nThings to think about are:\n\nIs the alarm\nsounding a warning, or is it a low-battery chirp?\n\nIs there\nsomething obviously present that could be causing a\nfalse-alarm?\n\nIs anyone\nfelling ill?\n\nIs the\nsource of the CO obvious or not?\n\nIF YOUR CARBON\nMONOXIDE ALARM ACTIVATES AND ANYONE IS EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS\nOF POISONING, IMMEDIATELY MOVE OUTSIDE TO FRESH AIR AND ACTIVATE\nAN EMERGENCY RESPONSE FROM A PHONE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.\n\nCO alarms are\ndesigned to give different warnings so the homeowner can easily\ndifferentiate between an actual alarm, and a low-battery\nsituation. If you are receiving a low-battery indication, place\nfresh batteries in the unit and reset the alarm in accordance\nwith the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nIt is quite\npossible that your are getting an alarm indication and there is\nno Carbon Monoxide present. Dust, humidity, steam and other\nconditions can cause false alarms. If you are positive that you\nhave identified a condition causing a false alarm, try to\nrectify the condition and reset the alarm. You may need to\ntemporarily move the unit to fresh air to help reset it.\nConsult your owner's manual regarding this.\n\nIn some cases,\nthe source of Carbon Monoxide may be obvious. For instance, all\nyour appliances use electric except for the oil-fired furnace,\nwhich has been running constantly on a very cold day. Or maybe\nyour power-washer has been running near an open door while you\nhave been cleaning your deck.\n\nYour first step\nshould be to immediately evacuate the house of all occupants,\nincluding the pets. If anyone appears to be suffering from CO\npoisoning, immediately activate an emergency response. Do not\nuse theTurn off the\nsource of the CO, or work to rectify the condition which led to\nit. Open the doors and windows to ventilate the house. Allow the\nhouse to ventilate for some time, then reset the alarm. If the\nalarm sounds again, continue to ventilate the house until you can get\nthe alarm to cease. If an appliance is causing the CO, do not\nuse it until a qualified professional can service it.\n\nDue to the nature\nof Carbon Monoxide, it is very likely that you will be unable to\nidentify the origin of the problem. For instance, it is\nThanksgiving and all your appliances use natural gas. Your\nfurnace, hot water heater, oven, cook top, and clothes dryer have\nall been in use periodically throughout the day when your only\nCO alarm on the second floor activates during dinner. What is\nthe source?\n\nIf you get an\nalarm activation and you are unable to positively identify the\nproblem, immediately evacuate the house of all occupants\nincluding the pets. If anyone appears to have symptoms of CO\npoisoning, immediately active an emergency response. Do not use\ntheMost current\nliterature suggests turning off all appliances and opening doors\nand windows on your way out to ventilate the house. That is\ndependent on the type of home you live in. If you live in a\nsingle-family home, do not concern yourself with these, except\nif an operating appliance could become a fire hazard. The reason\nis, you are going to have to call someone to inspect your house\nto find the problem. This could be your heating contractor, gas\ncompany, or fire department. Ventilating your home will help\ndisperse or remove any concentrations of Carbon Monoxide, making\nit harder to pinpoint the source during the investigation.\n\nHowever, should\nyou reside in an apartment, duplex, row house, or other attached\nhome, turn off any appliances and ventilate the house as you\nexit. In this case, the safety of your neighbors is more\nimportant than assisting the investigator in finding the source\nof the Carbon Monoxide.\n\nDo not return to\nyour home until the problem has been identified, rectified, and\nthe house properly ventilated and all Carbon Monoxide removed."}

Peroxyacetal nitrate also\nis implicated in the production of ozone, another irritant that makes breathing\ndifficult.\n\nAn international team of scientists conducted the study, which was part\nof the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Sciences in Complex Terrain program --\na long-term effort to study the effects that geographical features such as\nmountains and valleys have on air movement and pollution. The study was funded\nby DOE and the Mexican government.\n\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory organized the meteorological\nportion of the project and staffed one of six data-collection sites. \"The\ncomplex movement of air in the high basin makes it difficult to predict where\nthe pollution will concentrate at any given time,\" says Pacific Northwest?s\nChris Doran, science director of the project. \"The close coupling of\nmeteorological and chemistry measurements and analysis is necessary to\nunderstand how the surrounding terrain affects the transport and diffusion of\npollutants.\"\n\nThe study may help explain how fine particles form in the atmosphere.\nThese particles are potentially the most hazardous because they can lodge in the\nlungs, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed new standards\nfor fine particles. \"This study will be relevant to our understanding of the\nnature and causes of fine particle air pollution throughout the world, including\nthat found in U.S. cities,\" said Pacific Northwest's Sylvia Edgerton, project\ndirector.\n\nThe data will be used to improve computer models designed to predict\natmospheric conditions and potentially guide responses to pollution -- such as\nchanging the location or timing of pollution releases."}
{"text":"INTRODUCTION\nThe Bush Administration and Congress are considering new approaches\nintended to enhance the public health protection benefits of environmental\nprograms within available resources. One general approach being explored\nwould entail revising some federal strategies and priorities to place greater\nemphasis upon reducing health risks instead of simply responding to statutory\nrequirements or reacting to public perceptions. Such an approach would need\nto rely heavily upon the application of scientific knowledge in risk assessments.\nThe success of such an approach would therefore depend upon assessments\nof human exposures to toxic substances, because the exposure component of\na risk assessment often entails greater uncertainty than the hazard component,\nand because reducing human exposure is directly relevant to reducing health\nrisk for a given toxic substance.\nHuman exposure to air contaminants is one area in which a risk-reduction-\nbased approach could be beneficial. Traditionally, public concerns about air\npollution have focused on highly visible emission sources such as industrial\nsmokestacks and automobiles. Likewise, regulatory strategies mandated by\nthe Clean Air Act have emphasized controlling outdoor sources of air pollu-\ntion. Since 1970, these strategies have substantially reduced outdoor concen-\ntrations for five of the six pollutants for which National Ambient Air Quality\nStandards have been designated. It is important for these strategies to contin-\nue, because exposure to outdoor air pollutants continues to present significant\npublic health risks. For example, outdoor exposures to the sixth pollutant,\nozone, still threaten human health in many locations within the United States.\nAt the same time, air pollutants with major indoor sources are known to\ncause adverse health effects and personal discomfort, as described in the 1981\nNational Research Council (NRC) report, Indoor Pollutants. In part because\nthe Clean Air Act has been interpreted as applying only to outdoor air, little\n1\n\nOCR for page 2\n2 ASSESSING HUMAN EXPOSURE\nprogress has been made during the past 20 years in reducing potentially harm-\nful human exposures to air pollutants in many indoor locations. But most\npeople In the United States spend far more time indoors than outdoors; thus\nrisk reduction strategies that address only outdoor air quality are only partially\neffective. Such strategies need to be modified to better address the ~mpor-\ntance of indoor exposures.\nBenzene (a human carcinogen) provides an example In which the proper\napplication of exposure assessment methodology should be applied to identify\nareas where more effective strategies are needed to achieve greater reduction\nof risk. In response to its mandate in the Clean Air Act to control hazardous\nair pollutants, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promulgated regula-\ntions in August 1989 for industrial emissions of benzene to outdoor air. How-\never, other large sources of exposure to benzene are not covered by that\nrulemaking. Exposures from smoking, consumer products in the home, and\npersonal activities such as driving or painting have been estimated to account\nfor more than 80% of nationwide exposure to benzene. Therefore, actual\nhuman exposures to benzene at the most significant concentrations and dura-\ntions are likely to occur inside the home or while traveling within a motor\nvehicle (i.e., from sources not currently subject to Clean Air Act regulations).\nThe issue of benzene exposure assessment is addressed in Chapter 7, under\nVolatile Organic Compounds.\nThe following report describes a conceptual framework and methods for\nassessing and analyzing the totality of exposures of an individual to air con-\ntaminants in the course of all activities over specified increments of time.\nAccurate and realistic assessment of human exposures from all environmental\nmedia can help to ensure that appropriate priorities are set to achieve optimal\nreduction of human exposures to significant contaminants. E~osure-assess-\nment research should be supported by government programs according to\nsuch priorities, commensurate with the importance of human exposures to\nenvironmental contaminants, whether outdoors or indoors.\nTHE CHARGE TO THE COMMll1EE\nThe Committee on Advances in Assessing Human Exposure to Airborne\nPollutants was established in 1987 by the NRC's Board on Environmental\nStudies and Toxicology to review important new developments in exposure-\nassessment methods and instrumentation that have been produced in pollu-\ntion-related research, occupational medicine, and other disciplines during the\npast 10-15 years, especially as those developments apply to individual human\nexposures to airborne to~cants. The committee included members with ex\n\nOCR for page 3\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3\npertise in chemistry, mathematical modeling, engineering, physics, air pollu-\ntion, exposure assessment, medicine, biology, social science, statistics, and\nenvironTnental policy. The committee's work was sponsored by the Agency for\nToxic Substances and Disease Registry of the U.S. Public Health Service,\nwhose mission ~ to prevent or mitigate adverse human health ejects and\ndiminution In quaky of life resulting from exposure to hazardous substances\nin the environment.\nThe committee was charged to review new developments and developing\ntechnologies in exposure assessment, identify technological gaps, and recom-\nmend research and development priorities to fig those gaps The committee\nwas also charged to consider the value of various methods for est-imat~g\nchemical exposures ~ risk assessment, risk management, pollution control,\nand regulatory programs. As part of the information-gathering process, the\ncommittee sponsored a 2-day symposium in October 1988, to obtain current\n\"formation on the uses of exposure analyses, measurement instrumentation,\nanalytical and survey techniques, biological markers, and study design\nTHE COMMIT SHE'S APPROACH TO ITS CHARGE\nIn response to its charge, the committee focused on human exposure to\nairborne contaminants that can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin and\npotentially can cause adverse health effects or discomfort for an individual.\nThe committee did not consider in detail exposure to airborne contaminants\nthat come in contact with humans only after the contaminants have transferred\nto another environmental medium (e.g., deposition of airborne contaminants\ninto food or ingestion of contaminated soil or water). The committee ac-\nknowledges that exposure to airborne contaminants is only part of total e~o-\nsure, which includes all exposures a person has to a specific contaminant; this\nincludes all environmental media (air, water, food, and soil) and all routes of\nentry (inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption). Assessment of total\nexposure for specified contaminants requires the application of quantitative\ntechniques to all pertinent environmental media and all routes. A single-\nmedium exposure analysis, such as for air only, is appropriate only when\nsupported by convincing evidence that a single-medium exposure predominates\nfor the contaminants of concern.\nThe committee defines an exposure to a contaminant as an event consisting\nof contact at a boundary between a human and the environment at a specific\nenvironmental contaminant concentration for a specified interval of time; the\n\nOCR for page 4\n4 ASSESSING HUMAN EXPOSURE\nunits to egress exposure are concentration multiplied by time. Exposure\nassessment involves numerous techniques to identify the contaminant, contam-\ninant sources, environmental media of exposure, transport through each medi-\num, chemical and physical transformations, routes of entry to the body, inten-\nsity and frequency of contact, and spatial and temporal concentration patterns\nof the contaminant. An array of techniques can be employed, ranging from\nbasic techniques for estimating the number of people exposed, to sophisticated\nmethodology employing contaminant monitoring, modeling, and biological\nmarkers.\nArt organizing construct was developed by the committee to facilitate its\nevaluation of exposure-assessment techniques. The construct specified that\ntechniques be evaluated for their usefulness in reducing the uncertainty about\nexposures and in reducing the invasiveness of the measurement techniques,\nwhile improving the efficiency of ways to obtain data on the concentration and\nduration of contaminant contact with the individual or population. Exposure\nof the individual was considered key, because the committee determined that\nknowledge of such exposures is essential to make inferences about the general\npopulation.\nThe committee recognized that good exposure-assessment techniques do\nnot guarantee meaningful exposure data; techniques must be applied properly.\nTherefore, exposure-assessment techniques also were considered for their\nappropriateness in obtaining data within a scientifically sound conceptual\nframework for exposure assessment. The conceptual framework for exposure\nassessment defined by the committee is illustrated in Chapter 7 with a series\nof critical analyses of the ways in which exposure assessments could be and\nhave been applied to specific public-health concerns. It was not within the\ncommittee's charge to address in detail the proper application and further\ndevelopment of techniques to assess exposure to specific contaminants.\nRATIONALE FOR PERFORMING EXPOSURE ASSESSMENTS\nExposure assessment is an integral component of environmental epidemiol-\nogy, risk assessment, risk management, and disease diagnosis and treatment.\nIt is a multidisciplinary endeavor that frequently requires the combined exper\n1Confusion often occurs with the use of the tenets \"exposure\" and \"dose.\" Dose is\nthe amount of contaminant that is absorbed or deposited in the body of an exposed\nindividual over a specified time. Therefore, dose is different from and occurs as a\nresult of an exposure.\n\nOCR for page 5\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5\ntise of engineers, environmental and industrial hygienists, toxicologists, epide-\nmiologists, chemists, physicians, mathematicians, and social scientists. E~o-\nsure-assessment methodology employs direct and indirect techniques, including\nmeasurement of environmental variables (e.ge, indoor-air exchange rates);\npersona mowtor~g of contaminants ~ the breathing zone; and use of biolog'-\ncal markers, questionnaires, and computational modeling. Exposure assess-\nment is an equal partner with \"oncology in defining human health risk and\nidentifying e~osure-response relationships.\nAs relationships between particular agents and health effects have become\nbetter understood r~sk-assessment methodology has evolved to estimate the\nlikelihood that exposure to a given pollutant will produce a given health effect.\nAs defined in the 1983 NRC report, Risk Assessment in the Federal Govem-\nment: Managing the Process, risk assessment has four components: hazard\nidentification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk char-\nacterization. Figure 1 illustrates the integral role that exposure assessment\nplays in the risk-assessment and risk-management processes. Accurate expo-\nsure data on contaminant concentrations at the point of contact between a\nhuman and the environment are crucial to valid risk assessment.\nMany advances in knowledge of exposure assessment have not been well\nintegrated into standard risk-assessment practice. A common approach to\nregulation of contaminants has been to focus attention on a specific single\nenvironmental medium (e.g., air) and to deal with the problems of contamina-\ntion and human contact as a one-dimensional (single-medium) problem.\nAlthough multimedia approaches to environmental problems have received\nincreasing attention in recent years (e.g., EPA's 1986 \"Guidelines for Estimating\nExposures,\" which specify identification of the principal environmental path-\nways of exposure), risk-management practices generally remain dominated by\nsingle-medium and single-contaminant approaches.\nFRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING EXPOSURES\nTO AIR CONTAMINANTS\nExposure assessments for airborne constituents must be considered within\na framework that recognizes the potential contributions from other environ-\nmental media. Furthermore, to achieve effective risk assessment, risk man-\nagement, environmental epidemiology, and diagnosis and intervention in envi-\nronmental medicine, all media and routes of exposure should be assessed for\nthe relative magnitude of their contributions before an intensive assessment\nof one medium is conducted. To maximize opportunities for risk manage-\nment, exposure assessments should include information on the specific sources\n\nOCR for page 7\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 7\nof contaminants, locations of human contact with the contaminant, and envi-\nronmental factors affecting the exposures to ensure that effective and appro-\npriate mitigation measures can be formulated.

Data on\nindividual exposures can be integrated by summing over time (time-integrated\nexposure), over persons (population-integrated exposure), and over contami-\nnants (contaminant-integrated exposure).\nStudies to assess exposures to environmental contaminants, whether they\nare intended to improve environmental epidemiology' disease diagnosis and\nintervention, risk assessment, or risk management, need to consider the three\nprincipal methods of exposure assessment: personal monitoring, biological\nmarker measurements, and indirect methods (e.g., microenvironmental con-\ncentration measurements coupled through models to time-activity data ob-\ntained from questionnaires). These methods then can be incorporated into\nthe study design to the extent practical and necessary to meet the specific\nobjectives of the assessment. It is not always necessary to monitor contami-\nnant concentration in the breathing zone of each individual in a potentially\nexposed population. For example, if important contaminant sources and\nexposure locations were known from previous studies, only fixed-site monitor-\ning data and knowledge of the frequency and duration of exposure of individu-\nals at the contact location would be needed.\nExposure assessment has been practiced in several different disciplines, and\nnumerous definitions and methods of estimating exposure have been devel-\noped, including those in the 1988 EPA publication, Proposed Guidelines for\nExposure-Related Measurements.2 These guidelines define exposure by units\nof mass. EPA's definition multiplies exposure (units of contaminant concen-\ntration and time) by a contact rate (e.g., breathing in units of volume per\ntime). Tune and volume units cancel in the equation, leaving mass. This is\nmore appropriate as a definition of \"dose\" than of exposure, within the context\ndescribed by the NRC Committee on Biologic Markers.\nBecause standard definitions are critical to developing coherence in the\nfield of exposure assessment, the committee recommends that the scientific\nand regulatory communities, including those responsible for reviewing articles\nfor scientific journals, use consistently the definitions of exposure and expo-\nsure assessment recommended in this report to ensure standardization across\ndisciplines.\nhe EPA guidelines are being modified to incorporate new and improved ah\npreaches to understanding exposure.\n\nOCR for page 8\n8 ASSESSING HUMAN EXPOSURE\nSAMPLING AND PHYSICAL CHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS\nQuality Control and Quality Assurance\nUsing advanced measurement techniques in exposure studies does not in\nitself ensure better data. Quality-assurance (QA) programs are critical com-\nponents of exposure studies; they must be established as part of initial study\ndesigns, at which point it should be decided what precision and accuracy are\nneeded to test the study hypothesis. (Accuracy refers to the degree of agree-\nment of a measurement with an accepted reference or true value; precision\nis a measure of the agreement among repeated individual measurements.)\nQA activities, such as interlaboratory comparisons and measurement system\naudits, are carried out to ensure that the collected data achieve predetermined\nlevels of precision and accuracy. The committee considers QA to include\nquality control, which comprises operational activities carried out before and\nduring the measurement process to ensure that the accuracy and precision of\ndata are sufficient to meet the needs of a study. An effective QA program is\ncostly (approximately 15-25% of total study expenses) and should be consid-\nered when establishing a project's budget.\nA major deficiency in the field of exposure assessment is the general lack\nof validation studies for most new samplers and analytical instruments. In this\nregard, attention should be given to the availability of reliable chemical stan-\ndards (sample compounds of known composition and concentration) to use as\nvalidation references for measurement techniques. This is especially true for\nhighly reactive compounds. These compounds often are of concern from a\nhealth perspective, and stable, known quantities can be difficult to prepare.\nSampling Techniques and Strategy\nMost advances in exposure-assessment science have occurred in the devel-\nopment of samplers and measurement techniques for fixed-site and personal\nair monitor studies; the latter have focused on activities and sources that\ncontribute to individual and population exposures. However, new personal air\nsampling techniques have been underused~specially to provide data to sup-\nport regulatory decision making.\nThe choice of a sampling strategy and a measurement method hinges on\na strides specific aims and hypotheses. Physical, chemical, and biological\ncharacteristics of a pollutant dictate the method chosen to sample and meas-\nure its airborne concentration. Because a contaminant can have very different\nhealth effects in the vapor phase versus the condensed phase, care must be\n\nOCR for page 9\nEXECUTIVE SUMMERY 9\nexercised that the selected sampling procedure does not present a false picture\nof a contaminant's physical state.\nAirborne contaminants can be sampled actively or passively. Active sam-\npling uses a pump to pull airborne contaminants through a collection device.\nPassive sampling relies on molecular diffusion to deliver airborne =~tam~-\nnants to the collection medium. Passive monitors are well suited to collect\nlong-term integrated gas and vapor samples obtained over days or weeks, and\nthey can be extremely useful for personal or microenvironmental studies.\nHowever, long-term sampling Bath passive monitors often places great con-\ns~ain~ Qu the sorbent, which must retain the analyte of interest without\npromoting unintended reactions with other adsorbed analyses. Sorbent im-\nprovements are needed to allow long-term sampling for a wide variety of\nanalyses.\nPersonal air monitoring is the most direct approach for assessing human\nexposure to airborne pollutants. However, portability usually is attained at the\nexpense of sensitivity (compared with fixed-site microenvironmental monitor-\ning instruments). Personal monitors (active or passive) need to be developed\nfor many potentially harmful airborne contaminants, including certain metals,\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other semivolatile organic compounds,\npolar volatile organic compounds (e.g., vinyl chloride), and radon progeny. In\nsome cases, personal monitors already exist but need to be refined, reduced\nin weight and size, or validated (e.g., airborne particles and certain pesticides).\nCertain pollutants produce effects only at concentrations greater than a\nthreshold value. Therefore, personal samplers of such pollutants are needed\nthat will continuously monitor only exposures to concentrations greater than\na designated threshold for community and occupational exposures.\nQuiet and unobtrusive microenvironmental samplers are needed if f~xed-site\nsampling is to be used widely; such samplers should be developed for the full\nspectrum of air contaminants.\nNew sorbents for polar volatile organic, highly volatile, and very reactive\ncompounds are needed. Collection with sorbent sampling systems often is\nassociated with a compromise in analytic sensitivity, this results from the large\nvolumes used in liquid desorption techniques. Procedures such as supercritical\nfluid extraction that permit Resorption with a minimum of dilution need to be\ndeveloped.\nInstrumental Techniques\nMany advances have been made in instrument design, operation, and exper-\nimental deployment during the past 15 years. Liquid chromatography (LC)\n\nOCR for page 10\n10 ASSESSING HUMAN EXPOSURE\ntechniques are being used to analyze for compounds not amenable to gas\nchromatography (GC). In particular, ion chromatography is being used in-\ncreasingly to analyze highly polar air contaminants. LC combined with mass\nspectrometry also is being developed into a technique to complement GC\ncombined with mass spectrometry. The development of new types of detector\nconfigurations (e.g., ion trap mass spectrometer) has made mass spectrometry\na valuable air-analysis device. Simple advances have been made for other GC\nand LC detectors.\nField applications of exposure-assessment methods are restricted by mstru-\nment limitations. Portable, reliable, and rugged instruments such as gas chro-\nmatographs, gas chromatograph\/mass spectrometers, ion trap mass spectrom-\neters, and electrochemical sensors are needed. Sampling methods, instru-\nments, and software to function with these instruments also are needed to\npermit unattended sample collection and analyses in field settings for extended\nperiods. A sensitive, highly specific detector applicable to numerous com-\npounds is needed for LC. Continued improvements in LC combined with\nmass spectrometry are beginning to fill this gap.\nUSE OF BIOLOGICAL MARKERS IN ASSESSING\nHUMAN EXPOSURE TO AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS\nBiological markers in an exposed individual can provide information about\nan original contaminant, a metabolite of a contaminant, or the product of an\ninteraction between a contaminant agent and some target molecule or cell.\nAs one progresses from markers of exposure to markers of health effect,\nvariability associated with the individual becomes an increasingly significant\nproblem.\nBiological markers have been studied as a part of research on exposure to\nair pollutants for a limited number of compounds. Critical issues are associat-\ned with marker specificity and sensitivity to an exposure contaminant. In\nsome cases, biological markers cannot be used without adjustments for expo-\nsures to background concentrations of contaminants from the same or other\nmedia and adjustment for seasonal or regional variation.\nThe use of biological markers in exposure assessment should normally be\ndone in conjunction with personal or microenvironmental exposure-measure-\nment techniques. Biological markers integrate all routes and sources of expo-\nsure and can provide measures of the actual dose of a contaminant an individ-\nual has received when appropriate metabolic data are available and when the\nrelationships between times of exposure and sample collection are adequately\n\nOCR for page 11\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 11\ndefined. However, the actual routes and sources of exposure cannot be de-\ntected without information on environmental contaminant concentrations.\nAnalytical techniques with improved chemical specificity and sensitivity for\nbiologically significant markers are needed for exposure assessments; especial-\nly needed me flexible assays that ~ analyze several markers simultane,Qusly\nor be readily adapted to analyze numerous markers sequentially. For such\ntechniques, validation studies are needed to link biological markers conclusive-\nly to causative agents.\nPharmacokinetics is the quantitative description of the rates of absorption,\ndutribut;~, metabolism? and elimination of a contact taken into a bio-\nlog~cal system. Better pharmacokinet~c data are needed for an increasing\nnumber of chemicals. These data are needed to further the development and\nvalidation of sophisticated biological marker models and to further under-\nstanding of how to model multiple metabolic pathways as a function of expo-\nsure level.\nSURVEY RESEARCH METHODS\nAND EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT\nAlthough there have been major advances in personal monitoring equip-\nment and in conducting sociological studies of time use, exposure-related data\non human activity patterns are in short supply. The techniques normally\nemployed are questionnaires and recall diaries to obtain information on loca-\ntion and duration of human activities. Elementary principles of statistical\nsurvey design, sample selection, and question format often are ignored in\nquestionnaires and surveys used by exposure analysts. Collaboration of social\nscientists having expertise in survey statistics with exposure analysts can help\nto develop more appropriate questionnaires, to limit the effects of biased\nquestions, and to validate survey instruments before their use in the field.\nFar more attention needs to be given to the design of survey research in\nexposure studies. Exposure analysts need to employ the expertise of special-\nists in survey statistics and the measurement of human time-activity patterns\nthrough the use of questionnaires. Improvements are needed in the reliability\n(precision) and validity of survey results, especially with regard to estimates\nof frequency or duration of exposure. The estimation of long-term exposures\npresents challenges yet to be addressed by survey researchers.\nIn addition to resource-intensive surveys of large populations, far more use\nshould be made of well-designed, but less-expensive, sequential or one-time\nstudies done at the community level. Such surveys could be especially impor-\ntant for personal-exposure monitoring studies. In addition, a series of small\n\nOCR for page 12\n12 ASSESSING HUMAN EXPOSURE\nbenchmark surveys of\"normal\" situations or environments are needed to help\nestablish baselines for other studies (e.g., studies of time activity in \"health\/'\nbuildings for comparison with similar studies in ~sick\" buildings).\nMODELS USED IN ASSESSING\nHUMAN EXPOSURE TO AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS\nMathematical models use systems of equations to quantify and explain the\nrelationships between air-pollutant exposure and important variables, such as\nemission rates from contaminant sources, as well as for estimating exposures\nin situations where direct measurements are unavailable. These models are\nderived from assumptions and approximations that permit complex physical-\nchemical-behavioral problems to be represented by mathematical formula-\ntions.\nModels considered by the committee were classified into two broad catego-\nries: those that predict exposure (in units of concentration multiplied by time)\nand those that predict concentration (in units of mass per volume). Exposure\nmodels obviate extensive environmental- or personal-measurement programs\nby providing estimates of population exposures that are based on small num-\nbers of representative measurements. Although concentration models are not\ntruly exposure models, the output of concentration models can be used to\nestimate exposures when combined with information on human time-activity\npatterns.\nTo improve the development and validation of models, measurements are\nneeded of the concentrations of airborne pollutants in workplaces, homes, and\nother microenvironments. Simultaneous measurements of critical independent\nvariables, such as source-emission rates and indoor-ventilation rates, are also\nneeded for models. Concentration gradients within defined microenviron-\nments also need to be accurately measured.\nValidation studies are needed for many existing models. In particular,\nimmediate efforts are needed to validate the models used for decision making\nby EPA, ATSDR, and others about public and occupational health and to\ntailor the models to relate to the actual situations that can result in large\npopulation exposures. Valid emission-rate models are needed to provide\nbetter estimates for multicomponent mixtures. Validated outdoor-dispersion\nmodels are needed to predict concentrations in complex terrain and to provide\naccurate exposure estimates for down- and up-gradient terrain conditions.\nThe same data set used to develop a model cannot be used to refine and\nvalidate it; new, independent data are required. In addition, all assumptions\nused in developing a model should be documented explicitly. Care should be\n\nOCR for page 13\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 13\ntaken by investigators in any field-monitoring program to integrate measure-\nments with modelers' information needs so that the requisite model input data\nare obtained or the measurement results can be used to test, refine, or vali-\ndate appropriate models.\nLittle work has been done to model very short-term exposures (peak expo-\nsures) and gradients for dispersion, deposition, and ventilation In indoor envi-\nronments. Measuring and modeling the temporal patterns of source strength\nas a function of readily identifiable or measurable source characteristics is a\ncritical step In that process. In addition, more work is needed to model the\nrelationship of indoor-air quality to the composition of the outdoor air.\nConcentration Models\nNew developments in outdoor-dispersion models have improved prediction\nof the average and time-varying concentrations to which individuals are ex-\nposed. Receptor models can be compared with dispersion models as a means\nof checking the predictions of both models. They also can be used to identify\nsources of exposure. In many cases, however, data describing the source\ncharacteristics are not available on the time scale for which the model predic-\ntions are needed. Such mismatches of the time scale of the measurements\nwith the time scale of the models impede model development, validation, and\napplication to new exposure scenarios.\nSource-emission models are available to predict mass-emission rates for a\nvariety of dynamic and steady-state emission problems. The available emis-\nsion models allow the estimation of downwind exposure for continuous and\ncatastrophic releases of pure compounds or binary mixtures. However, these\nmodels have not been validated. Dense cloud dispersion models are available\nto estimate downwind exposure for heavier-than-air vapor or aerosol releases;\nthey also have not been validated.\nExposure Models\nModels for predicting exposures to populations have been developed but\nhave not been adequately validated. Limited validation studies of the EPA's\n\"Simulation of Human Air Pollution Exposure Model,\" for example, show that\nthe average exposure values are well predicted but also show substantial dis-\ncrepancies in the tails of the distribution. Further development and validation\nof these models are warranted. Exposure models used for regulatory decision\n\nOCR for page 14\n14 ASSESSING HUAlAN EXPOSURE\nmaking should be developed and validated for microenv~ronments where\nsignificant exposures occur.\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT\nAir-exposure reduction strategies for a given contaminant should first\nconsider exposures due to all media. If other media are found to contribute\nsignificantly to the total exposure even after air exposures are reduced, agen-\ncies responsible for or experienced with the other media should be apprised\nof the issue and be actively involved in the development of ir~tegra;ted expo\nsure-reduct~on strategies.\nUnless the health effect of a contaminant is unique or the source of the\ncontaminant exposure is well characterized, it is difficult to relate an exposure\nto a health effect for one of a group of contaminants present in specific micro-\nenvironments. When a contaminant does not have a unique health effect, it\nis necessary to identify those situations where populations can have substantial\nexposures. Once the exposure is assessed, that information should be used\nto perform studies to establish the magnitude of the health outcome from\nexposure in those situations.\nAttempts to assess human exposure to air contaminants have achieved\nvarying degrees of success. It is easy to find flaws with any exposure study\nwhen we are only beginning to understand the ways in which human activity\naffects exposures of individuals and populations. It is clear, however, that the\nfield of air contaminant exposure assessment has advanced significantly as a\nresult of indoor-a~r pollution studies. Further progress will be achieved as\nexposure study designs more completely address and rank potential contribu-\ntions from all environmental media to all relevant microenv~ronments."}

Sometimes I feel a little insulted when people criticize my city, Manhattan. It can't be the worst. It's not. New numbers demonstrate the hazardous air quality of Beijing, and puts things in perspective.\n\nThe United States Embassy in Beijing has been tracking the Air Quality Index, standards set by the United States' EPA, for a few years. Two years ago, in a Tweet, they recorded that Beijing was at a \"crazy high...\" 500.\n\nAs of Saturday, January 12, at 8 p.m., the number reached an all time, off the charts record of 755.\n\nThe embassy alerts the public of these numbers using their @BeijingAir Twitter feed- a method that Beijing officials have criticized and have tried to remove for years.\n\nAccording to the EPA, air qualities between 301 and 500 are considered to be \"hazardous.\" Numbers off the index are extremely unsafe for residents. Factories operating in neighboring province consist of more than 20 million, but there's no definite answer to why the index went so off the charts. To put things in perspective, at the same time of Beijing's 755 that weekend, New York City was a 19.\n\nBeijing residents are describing the air quality as terrifying and post-apocalyptic. They are searching the stores for face masks and air purifiers and closing their windows and doors to their homes.\n\nBeijing schools kept children indoors and hospitals saw a spike in respiratory cases following this weekend.\n\nWhat do you think the embassy is going to do?

{"text":"The first time Bill Ferullo saw the white plumes drifting from a natural gas fracking site, he got out of his car to take pictures.\n\n\"I didn't know what it was,\" he recalled. \"But two minutes later my chest was burning. It burned all night.\"\n\n\"At frack sites, silica gets into the air and you get these huge plumes of dust that can be breathed in by workers and anybody nearby, downwind,\" said Miriam Rotkin-Ellman, scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\n\"This is in people's backyards,\" Rotkin-Ellman added. \"It doesn't take much silica to cause a health problem.\"\n\nThe process of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, requires blasting large volumes of water, chemicals and silica sand into bedrock. Up to 4 million pounds of the sand is used per well to prop open the newly created fractures in the rock and release natural gas. The recent rapid expansion of natural gas production has saved Americans billions of dollars in energy costs, according to one recent study, but it has raisedhealth concerns ranging from toxic metals contaminating drinking water to large quantities of diesel exhaust pumped into the air.\n\nExposure to dust containing silica sand is a relative newcomer to that list.\n\nEric Esswein, a senior industrial hygienist with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, monitored the exposure of 116 workers at 11 fracking sites and found that 79 percent of air samples had more silica dust than recommended and 31 percent had at least 10 times more than recommended. The highest reading came in with 137 times the U.S. recommended limit of silica \u2014 what Esswein called \"occupational hazard of antiquity\" during a presentation of his findings at the Institute of Medicine earlier this year.\n\nSilicosis, which has plagued miners and construction workers throughout history, can take years, even decades to appear. Once it does, it is incurable, irreversible and progressive, noted Esswein.\n\nWhile some natural gas site workers who were studied wore respirators, the devices only protect up to 10 times the recommended limit of silica, explained Rotkin-Ellman. Nearby residents are not provided respirators. Esswein and his team did not study how far the silica sand travels nor any other community-wide impacts.\n\nPrompted by the new findings, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, along with the NIOSH, released a joint hazard alert on fracking silica in June. The document included recommendations, such as watering down dusty roads around a well site, but no new regulations for the natural gas industry.\n\nWhen asked by The Huffington Post if and when revised regulations might be issued that take into account these new findings, OSHA spokesman Jesse Lawder said that the agency had \"no update at this time.\"\n\nTravis Windle, spokesman for the Marcellus Shale Coalition, said natural gas companies in Pennsylvania were nevertheless following the government's advice.\n\n\"Our industry is absolutely aware of the recommendations laid out by OSHA and NIOSH, and continue to work to further raise the workforce safety bar,\" said Windle. \"These recommendations are not an indication that our industry is somehow unsafe.\n\n\"Ensuring the health and safety of employees, contractors and of course those in the communities where we operates is our foremost priority,\" Windle added. \"The nearly 230,000 folks who work across the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania live in these communities, and are raising their families here.\"\n\nWes Gillingham of Catskill Mountainkeeper, a grassroots advocacy group, is looking ahead to what may come if New York state opens up its portion of the East's Marcellus Shale formation to fracking. He's concerned that the state's proposed review on fracking impacts won't take into account the newly recognized health risks of fracking sand, or fully evaluate the array of other concerns. The New York Department of Environmental Protection faces a Nov. 29 deadline to complete new regulations for fracking, reported The Associated Press on Friday.\n\n\"The silicosis issue from the frack sand is one of many issues that add up to extensive health costs to our communities,\" said Gillingham. \"This cost is many affected lives and the lives of our children.\"\n\nOf course, the health risks aren't limited to communities around frack wells. Workers and residents can be exposed to airborne silica at several points in the natural gas production process \u2014 which tends to span thousands of miles \u2014 including mining, transportation and offloading.\n\nMining for fracking's essential sand is rising in tandem with the expansion of natural gas production, with an estimated annual demand in the U.S. of 40 billion pounds, and growing. Many residents in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where the prime crystalline silica is unearthed, are speaking out about their environmental and public health concerns.\n\nFerullo said he is worried about his own health after breathing the dust. But he's more concerned about the other nearby families with children \u2014 some living as close as 500 feet from a fracking site \u2014 as well as his own grandkids.\n\n\"Even my son is now concerned about bringing his daughter up here to visit,\" he said."}

{"text":"How Maintaining Your Furnace Can Help Keep Sickness at Bay\n\nYour house could be making you sick. Your head hurts, your throat is sore, your eyes itch, and you feel like you have a cold or the flu. Maybe it's time to check that dirty furnace?\n\nDuring the winter, people want their homes to stay as cozy as possible, so they seal the warm air in tightly. It's like living inside a bubble. You want the air circulating inside your home to be safe and clean, but if your furnace is dirty or doesn't work properly, you could be creating an atmosphere of dangerous toxins.\n\nWhat's making you sick?\n\nYour furnace contains a filter to trap dirt, allergens, pollen, spores, and whatever else might be floating around in the air. These toxic and dangerous airborne particles can turn your filter into a breeding ground for disease if the filter is not changed on a regular basis.\n\nAnd if you or others in your home just got over a bout with the flu, then those germs are also stuck in your filter. The air coming out of your vents could be filled with germs and invisible hazards. It's no wonder you feel sick.\n\nAir cannot properly circulate through a dirty filter. You may be depriving your home of precious oxygen needed to make your body work properly. A lack of oxygen can give you headaches and make you feel worn-out and tired.\n\nAnother point to remember is some furnaces are powered by combustible gases like natural gas. The flue on the furnace is designed to contain these harmful gases and to trap the carbon monoxide produced from these gases. If the flue is clogged or contains leaks, then these toxic gases can escape into your home. Breathing in carbon monoxide will not just make you very sick, but it can be deadly.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nIt is very important to know how to maintain your furnace to keep you and your family safe and healthy. While furnaces require professional maintenance on a yearly basis, there are a few simple tasks you can do on your own to maintain your furnace. But remember, always turn off the heater before performing any maintenance.\n\n1. Replace your dirty filter. Most home improvement stores carry a variety of replaceable furnace filters. Always read the instructions on the filter's package. Some filters capture allergens, and some only trap dirt. The longevity on all filters can vary, too.\n\n2. Keep a carbon monoxide monitor near your furnace and in your home to detect dangerous gases. These small devices save lives every year.\n\n3. Inspect the flue of the furnace for leaks, holes, or corroded metal. Small leaks can be patched with aluminum tape, but it's always best to let a professional take a look.\n\n4. Vacuum in and around floor vents to eliminate excess dirt.\n\nNow you are armed with the basic skills to maintain your furnace. Be sure to contact a furnace professional if you think your furnace needs more than routine maintenance. Your health depends on it.\n\nKim Wade is a freelance writer who writes about motherhood, blogging, and technology."}

Supplements can help!\n\nDate: 8\/23\/2007 12:36:02 PM ( 6 y ) ... viewed 1699 times\n\nMost people have read the recent report that links pollution, specifically, fine particle pollution, to an increased risk of heart disease.\n\nThat study, by Barbara Hoffman of the University of Duisberg-Essen, Germany, evaluated over 4000 people who lived at various distances from high traffic roads.\n\nDr. Hoffman stated in an interview about the study that \"The most important finding of our study is that living close to high traffic, a major source of urban air pollution, is associated with atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries \u2014 the blood vessels that supply the heart. People who live near a German freeway or federal highway, which can be traveled by 10,000 to 130,000 cars daily, have more atherosclerosis the closer they live to the road,\" Hoffmann said.\n\n\"If you live at a distance of, for example, 100 meters (321 feet) from the freeway of highway, then on average you have seven percent more calcification in your coronary arteries than a person with the same cardiovascular risk profile who lives 200 meters (642 feet) away.\"\n\nSEVEN percent more calcification for every 100 meters closer you live to busy roads. That is staggering!\n\nIn the US, > 80% of us live in urban areas, surrounded by busy roads, power plants, and other industrial factories. It seems that anyone who doesn't actively seek natural products to consistently cleanse and fortify their bodies may be in trouble.\n\nHeart disease is still the number one disease in the US, not to mention that respiratory illness, and autoimmune conditions are rising to epidemic proportions. All have the common symptoms of inflammation, thrombosis, stenosis, etc. These symptoms are described in my first blog as all being linked to soft tissue calcification.\n\nIn a previous blog, I discussed calci-clear.

Dust and aerosol pollution from Asia travels across the ocean and sullies the air in the United States and Canada, possibly worsening the effects of climate change, a study showed Thursday.\n\nDust and aerosol pollution from Asia travels across the ocean and sullies the air in the United States and Canada, possibly worsening the effects of climate change, a study showed Thursday.\n\nAbout half of the aerosol particles in North America come from foreign sources, and most are just from naturally occurring dust rather than from burning coal or other fossil fuels, said the research published in the journal Science.\n\nSince dust emissions could rise as a result of increasingly dry weather, drought and desertification brought on by climate change, efforts by North America alone to curb pollution would not be enough, it said.\n\nInstead, all nations must work together to cut back on harmful emissions in the environment, the study urged.\n\nThe imported aerosols could be harming the environment by absorbing radiation from the sun, altering cloud formation along with rain and snow patterns, and speeding snow melt in the western US mountains, said the study.\n\nThe research was based on data from a US-French environment satellite called CALIPSO that allowed scientists to separate which particles were natural dust and which were pollutant based.\n\nThe team included experts at the University of Maryland, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Universities Space Research Association in Maryland.\n\n\"To mitigate aerosol impacts on regional climate change, actions by a single nation are inadequate. The world must work cooperatively and act synchronically to meet the challenges of global health on a changing planet,\" said the study.\n\nIt also called for more study on how dust itself may affect climate.\n\n\"Dust emissions can respond to climate changes, such as changes of wind, precipitation and vegetation. It is thus essential to acquire better understanding of the interactions between dust and climate,\" the study said.\n\nResearchers noted that their current focus was on foreign dust and aerosols carried into the United States and Canada, but that aerosols emitted and produced in North America certainly affect other regions in much the same way.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nA new NASA study estimates that most ground-level particulate pollution in the United States stems from regional sources in North America and only a small amount is brought to the country from other parts ...\n\nQilong Min, Ph.D., Senior Research Associate and Professor with the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) at the University at Albany is developing innovative ways to measure how dust in the Sahara Desert ...\n\nScientists using the nation's newest and most capable aircraft for environmental research are launching a far-reaching field project this month to study plumes of airborne dust and pollutants that originate ...\n\n(Phys.org) -- Dust is more than something to be brushed off the furniture.

{"text":"Impacts of Building Ventilation on Health and Performance\n\nSome Disadvantages of Increased Ventilation\n\nIndoor concentrations of some outdoor air pollutants can increase with ventilation rate. Increases in indoor ozone concentrations may be most significant. Higher outdoor air ozone concentrations are associated with adverse respiratory and irritation effects and several other health effects [48]. Outdoor air polluted with ozone is normally the major source of indoor ozone. Because ozone is removed from indoor air through chemical reactions with indoor pollutants and materials, indoor ozone concentrations tend to be substantially lower than outdoor air ozone concentrations [49]; i.e., buildings tend to shield us from outdoor ozone. However, as ventilation rates increase, indoor ozone concentrations become closer to outdoor concentrations [49]. Thus, increasing the ventilation rates will increase our exposures to ozone.\n\nIncreases in ventilation rates will also generally increase indoor concentrations of, and exposures to, outdoor air respirable particles, while simultaneously reducing our exposures to indoor-generated particles. Higher outdoor particle concentrations are associated with a broad range of adverse health effects [50]. If the incoming outdoor air is filtered to remove most particles, the influence of ventilation rate on indoor particle concentrations can be small [51].\n\nVentilation rates, if stable over time, will not generally affect time-average indoor concentrations of non-reactive gaseous outdoor air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, but higher ventilation rates can increase peak indoor concentrations.\n\nA higher indoor humidity, which, in turn, can lead to more indoor dust mites (an important allergen source) and to a greater risk of indoor mold growth, is another potential consequence of increased ventilation rate. Indoor humidity will increase with ventilation rate only when the outdoor air is more humid than the indoor air, e.g., during hot humid weather, and when the building mechanical systems also do not dehumidify sufficiently to counteract the effects of increased moisture entry. When outdoor air is less humid than indoor air, e.g., during cool winter weather, more ventilation decreases the indoor humidity.\n\nFrom the discussion provided above, it is clear that more ventilation can increase our exposures to some pollutants, particularly where and when the outdoor air is highly polluted or warm and humid. At the same time, the increases in ventilation rate will diminish our exposures to a variety of indoor-generated air pollutants. On balance, the scientific literature points to improvements in health and performance with increased ventilation rate; however, at polluted locations where it may not be possible or practical to adequately remove pollutants from incoming ventilation air, it is possible that some moderate intermediate ventilation rate is better for health than higher ventilation rates. At hot-humid locations, mechanical cooling and dehumidification systems should be designed to accommodate the moisture loads associated with the prescribed ventilation rates. More research is needed to examine the tradeoffs associated with increases in building ventilation"}
{"text":"The National Institutes of Health has awarded a $1.04 million RO1 grant to Rodrigo X. Armijos, M.D., Sc.D., associate professor of public health sciences at The University of Texas at El Paso, to investigate the adverse effects of air pollution on the cardiovascular health of children.\n\nArmijos and his UTEP team will conduct the study on elementary school-aged children in El Paso to see if transient exposure to high levels of air pollution causes oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. He will also examine whether systemic inflammation that results from long term exposure to air pollutants can lead to arterial stiffness and thickness, which are predictors of cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries.\n\nArmijos said that while other studies have looked at the effects of air pollution and cardiovascular health in adults, this is the first study to examine this problem in young children in the United States.\n\n\"Cardiovascular disease kills more people than all different type of cancers together and is the cause of other major health problems,\" Armijos said. \"It is worse in people who are already sick, such as persons with diabetes. If they are exposed to air pollution, that makes it even worse because it can aggravate or increase problems with cardiovascular disease.\n\n\"We need to take steps to prevent cardiovascular disease early in at-risk persons and groups. If we don't, by the time children grow up and reach their 30s and 40s, they're at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. They're going to have a lot of health problems and at that point it's already too late.\"\n\nAccording to Armijos, when people breathe in air pollutants, such as from vehicle exhaust, particles travel from the lungs to the arteries, resulting in inflammation. The problem can be further complicated if other pro-inflammatory factors are involved such as obesity, a high fat diet and a sedentary lifestyle. He believes that by incorporating anti-inflammatory factors, such as a diet rich in antioxidants, the effect of pollution on cardiovascular health can be potentially mitigated.\n\nArmijos and his team conducted a similar NIH funded study from 2009-11 in Quito, Ecuador, where he looked at the cardiovascular health of children in neighborhoods with varying levels of air pollution. The study found that children living in heavily polluted neighborhoods had more systemic inflammation and early signs of atherosclerosis compared to children in less polluted neighborhoods.\n\n\"El Paso is the ideal place to conduct this type of study because we have a lot of people who are living in very highly polluted environments because they can't afford to move to other cleaner areas in the city,\" Armijos said."}

Smoke can hurt your eyes, irritate your\nrespiratory system, and worsen chronic heart and lung diseases. Fortunately, most\npersons who are exposed to thick smoke will not have health problems.How much and how long you are exposed to the\nsmoke, as well as your age and degree of susceptibility play a role in\ndetermining whether or not someone will experience smoke-related problems.If you are experiencing serious medical\nproblems for any reason, seek medical treatment immediately.\n\nIf you have heart or lung disease,\nsmoke might make your symptoms worse.\n\nPeople who have heart disease might\nexperience chest pain, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath and fatigue\n\nSmoke may worsen symptoms for people\nwho have pre-existing respiratory conditions, such as respiratory\nallergies, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in\nthe following ways:\n\nInability to\nbreathe normally\n\nCough with\nor without mucus\n\nChest\ndiscomfort\n\nWheezing and\nshortness of breath\n\nWhen smoke levels are high enough, even\nhealthy people may experience some of these symptoms.\n\nHow can I protect myself and my family from the harmful\neffects of smoke?\n\nThe best thing to do is to limit your exposure to the\nsmoke.Specific strategies to decrease\nexposure to smoke include staying indoors whenever possible, using air\nconditioners (air conditioned homes usually have lower air exchange rates than\nhomes that use open windows for ventilation), using mechanical air cleaners\n(i.e. hepa filtration), keeping windows closed while driving in a vehicle, doing\nless strenuous physical activity (i.e. fast walking, rather than jogging) and\nminimizing other sources of air pollution (e.g., smoking tobacco, using wood\nburning stoves, burning candles or incense and vacuuming).\n\nWill I suffocate in my house?\n\nNo. The most common\ncall for evacuation during a wildfire is due to the direct threat of the fire,\nnot smoke. Leaving the area of thick\nsmoke may be an option for those who are sensitive to smoke.But it is often difficult to predict the\nduration, intensity and direction of smoke, making this an unattractive choice\nto many people.\n\nDuring severe smoke events, local clean air shelters may be\ndesignated to provide residents with a cool place to get out of the smoke, or\nindividuals may choose to visit these locations on their own. These places may include large commercial\nbuildings, educational facilities, shopping malls, movie theaters or any place\nwith effective air conditioning and particle filtration.\n\nShould\nI Wear a mask or N95 respirator?\n\nThe Department of Health does not recommend the wearing of\nany masks or respirators at this time.\n\nWill a wet towel or bandana provide any help?\n\nThe Department of Health does not recommend using wet towels\nor bandanas.Since wet towels or\nbandanas may not be sealed to the face and their capacity to filter very small\nparticles is unknown, they will likely provide little to no protection. They\nare also not certified as effective respirators by National Institute for\nOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\n\nWhat should I do if I must drive to work?\n\nIndividuals can reduce the amount of smoke particles in\ntheir vehicles by keeping the windows closed. The car's ventilation systems typically remove\na portion of the particle coming in from outside. For best results, individuals may want to use\nthe recirculate air feature found in most cars, which will help keep the\nparticulate levels lower.\n\nOur community has an outdoor game scheduled for this\nevening, should we cancel it?\n\nAll persons in areas affected by the wildfire smoke are\nbeing advised to limit outdoor activity and stay indoors whenever possible to\nminimize exposure to the smoke. Contact\nyour local emergency management officials for more guidance.\n\nSome air cleaners may be effective at reducing indoor particle\nlevels, but most are not effective at removing gases and odors, and also tend\nto be expensive. Some devices, known as\nozone generators, personal ozone devices, \"energized oxygen\", \"triatomic oxygen\",\n\"activated oxygen\" and \"pure air\" generators are sold as air cleaners, but they\nare not recommended for use in occupied buildings.Ozone does not remove particles from the air,\nand would not be effective during smoke events.Ozone itself is toxic and a regulated outside air pollutant.We advise the public to avoid exposure to\nozone indoors by not using air cleaners that produce ozone.For additional information consider reviewing\nthe US Environmental Protection Agency document:\"Ozone Generators That Are Sold As Air\nCleaners\" available at \n\nAlso, humidifiers or de-humidifiers are not technically air\ncleaners and will not significantly reduce the amount of particles in the air\nduring a smoke event.\n\nWhat should I do about closing up my house when it is so hot\nin there?\n\nIf you do not have an air conditioner and if it is too warm\nto stay inside with the windows closed, seek alternative shelter.\n\nIf I have respiratory problems and can't reach my doctor,\nwhere should I go?\n\nIf you have a medical emergency you should call 911 or go\nthe hospital emergency room immediately.\n\nWhat do I bring if I'm told to evacuate my home?\n\nIf asked or instructed to evacuate your home make sure to\nbring your important family documents (birth certificates, wills, insurance\npolicies, etc), any valuables and your family disaster supply kit.

{"text":"The presence of combustible dust in the air creates an unnecessary risk that can devastate an operation.\n\nGood indoor air cleaning also prevents buildup of nuisance dust on process equipment, electrical control panels and circuit boards, inspection equipment, and paperwork.\n\nPlant explosions are unpredictable and usually deadly. The presence of combustible dust in the air creates an unnecessary risk that can devastate an operation. In fact, dust of any kind can have a huge impact on an industrial plant, with consequences that are as expensive as they are preventable.\n\n\"OSHA has established permissible exposure limits (PELs) for hundreds of dusts.\"\n\nBeing suspended in an aerosol can make innocuous materials amazingly hazardous. Something that is mildly flammable can, by virtue of the intimate relationship between dust suspended in the air and the oxygen that is present, become an explosive mixture. Similarly, when breathed as an aerosol, the chemical attributes of some substances can become suddenly very aggressive. Lead or other toxic metals can enter the circulatory system very efficiently. Materials that ordinarily stay put suddenly move about on the mildest breeze and create hazards for equipment and people in areas that may be quite distant from the source of the contamination.\n\n\"Dust impacts people, who are forced to breathe unhealthy air,\" says Charles Dix, engineer and co-owner, Carolina Hydro Technologies ( in Providence, North Carolina. \"Also, dust collects in motors, and a lot of electrical cabinets are not airtight. It can have an effect on product quality and the general housekeeping quality of a plant.\"\n\nBreathing room\n\nIndustry specifics\n\nPharmaceuticals: When you look at some industries \u2013 pharmaceuticals being a great example \u2014 they understand how to manage industrial ventilation. They understand they have materials and dusts they have to be concerned with, and they understand the consequences of not addressing it, so they're all over system design. In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, the material they're producing has high value, so they're very protective of it, or there's an inherent recognition that there are hazards associated with it. Overall, there's a desire to control it. You tend to see the same thing in industries where there's any kind of toxicity or recognized hazard associated with the dust.\n\nAutomotive: Other industries get it because of consequences. Automotive manufacturing is a great example because, if they don't exercise good control, they can have a negative impact downstream. If they're not doing good indoor air quality management in the plant for their welding lines and their cutting lines, it may show up in their paint line areas where they'll see parts coming in that aren't as clean as they need to be, or they'll have other defects.\n\nFurniture: The furniture industry is another one where, if they're not doing a good job of dust mitigation in one area, when they go over to the area where they're doing varnishing, that area's not clean and they see the impact of poor dust-collection-system design in terms of defects.\n\nMetals: Some industries have undergone a lot of technology advancements. The metals industry are an example. Lasers and plasma-cutting tables have become much more sophisticated. Operational demands have gone up, and you're seeing more facilities that want to run lights-out, where they're getting 24\/7 production with robots and automation. Any kind of maintenance downtime in those types of conditions becomes extremely expensive. If a dust control device can cut the maintenance requirements by even a few percentage points, that can add a lot to the bottom line.\n\nIf you look from industry to industry, where it impacts a revenue stream, they usually get it. Nobody really buys dust collectors because of their esoteric value. They buy them because they have to have them. For most folks, once they've purchased and installed a dust collector, they'd prefer to just as soon forget they even own it. They want to focus their attention in other areas.\n\nAirborne contaminants occur in gaseous form or as aerosols, explains Ivan D. Ivanov, MD, PhD , team leader, occupational health, Department of Public Health and Environment, World Health Organization (WHO,  in Geneva, Switzerland. \"In scientific terminology, an aerosol is defined as a system of particles suspended in a gaseous medium, usually air, in the context of occupational hygiene,\" he says. \"Aerosols may exist in the form of airborne dusts, sprays, mists, smokes and fumes. In the occupational setting, all these forms may be important because they relate to a wide range of occupational diseases. Airborne dusts are of particular concern because they are well known to be associated with classical widespread occupational lung diseases, as well as with systemic intoxications such as lead poisoning, especially at higher levels of exposure.\" Interest also is on the increase in other dust-related diseases, such as cancer, asthma, allergic alveolitis, and irritation, as well as a whole range of non-respiratory illnesses, which may occur at much lower exposure levels.\n\nCertain industrial processes produce dust, which give rise to these health risks or concerns. \"Hexavalent chromium is one that's been in the media a lot for the metals industry,\" explains Kirt Boston, global manager of Torit product technology at Donaldson Filtration Solutions ( \"They're concerned about employee exposure to the carcinogenic property of hexavalent chromium. Silica is another one that gets a lot of attention in foundries or in abrasive blasting and mining applications. Concerns on toxic properties of dusts and mists run the whole gamut. If you move into the pharmaceutical industries, potent compounds have their own sets of concerns and risks.\"\n\nPlant upkeep\n\nPoor indoor air quality not only makes employees more prone to illness, causes lost production time, and leads to poor morale and lower productivity, it also can impact facility maintenance, adds says Travis Haynam, director of business development & technical sales at United Air Specialists ( \"Dust migration and buildup throughout the factory adversely affects product quality and can create unsafe conditions such as slippery surfaces or even fire and explosion hazards,\" he says. \"For production equipment, dust increases wear and tear on bearings or moving parts and results in increased maintenance intervals, as well as reduced service life. All of these consequences lead to increased operating costs for the plant.\"\n\nDust impacts the indoor air quality in many places. \"One area you may not expect is the office working areas, where the dust and contamination infiltrate the ventilation systems and then show up inside parts of the building that aren't exposed to the plant floor,\" says Andrew Stewart, senior manager, sustainability, Grainger ( \"While the plant floor is a crucial place to ensure proper safety measures are taken to protect employees and ensure optimal air quality, it is also important to keep in mind those areas that you don't immediately associate with being exposed to dust. Telltale signs of the infiltration are dark tiles or areas near the air flow vents. The cause is likely dust getting into the HVAC system, either through the fresh air intakes or the duct work seams are vulnerable to the dust entering them.\""}

{"text":"Building-Related Symptoms: Also Known As Sick Building Syndrome\n\nAs opposed to building-related illness where there are specific health complaints that are caused by a known problem, building-related symptoms (BRS), also called sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms are nonspecific and cannot be traced to a particular cause. Building-related symptoms are generally characterized by the following:\n\nPeople in the same building complain of mucous membrane irritation, (such as eye, nose, or throat irritation) headache, dizziness, and difficulty in concentrating.\n\nThe symptoms are relieved soon after leaving the building.\n\nThe cause of the symptoms is not known.\n\nWhen there are many people who complain that their symptoms seem to be associated with a particular building, that building may be labeled \"sick.\" The problem with labeling a building as sick is that there is no agreement on the criteria that can differentiate between \"sick\" and \"healthy\" buildings. For example, there is no agreement on the number, pattern, severity, or frequency of symptoms; no agreement on how to measure symptoms, and not even agreement on what symptoms should be measured.\n\nHowever, most people agree that indoor air quality (IAQ) complaints began to increase following the oil embargo of 1973. That is when homes and offices began introducing energy conservation measures such as insulation, non-opening windows, and super efficient HVAC systems, which did not exchange as much air as before (only 5 cfm per person as opposed to the 20 cfm recommended by ASHRAE). Perhaps energy conservation has led to less ventilation, allowing indoor pollutants to build up inside homes and buildings. However, during that same period, many changes occurred in office work, such as the use of computers and other new work technologies, which forced a change in office procedures and productivity. Coupled with the conservation measures and changing technology, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of workers in white-collar jobs. Because of these changes, ergonomic and organizational stress problems have also increased. Further complicating ongoing attempts to understand BRS, some observers have noted that BRS complaints are more common in air-conditioned than naturally ventilated offices.\n\nAccording to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), it is estimated that 30 percent of non-industrial buildings have IAQ problems.1 In addition, the World Health Organization(WHO) also has estimated that nearly one in three new and remodeled buildings worldwide will have IAQ complaints that lead to problems such as low morale, loss of productivity, and even absence from work. While the large majority of these will be comfort, rather than health related problems, 10 percent to 25 percent will be categorized as BRS (or SBS). In a random sampling of US office workers, 24 percent said there were air quality problems in their work environments, and 20 percent believed these problems affected their work performance.2\n\nCauses of Building-Related Symptoms\n\nDespite all the research done over the past 20 years about cases of BRS, it has been estimated that the cause has not been identified in more than 75 percent of cases.3 Buildings that have been alleged to have BRS problems include schools, laboratories, hospitals, and large, complex government buildings. Many of these are thought to be prone to IAQ problems because of their complicated and specialized HVAC systems. Buildings in the southeastern U.S. have additional IAQ concerns because of the hot, humid weather during their longer summers.\n\nIn newly constructed or recently remodeled home and office spaces, reports of indoor air problems during the first six months of occupation are common. Many of these health complaints are thought to be due to volatile organic compounds(VOCs), off-gassing from new building materials, and interior furnishings. However, in buildings that have been \"sick\" for years, the explanation may be with other problems such as mold contamination. A NIOSH study linked about half the cases of SBS to poor ventilation and the other half to a combination of things such as4:\n\nPoor quality air in the area around the building\n\nPollutants from office equipment such as copying machines and other electrical equipment\n\nThe number of people complaining of sick building-related symptoms is on the rise.Across the country, doctors are reporting that the number of patients they are seeing with BRS has increased by 40 percent in the past 10 years.5 Part of this could be due to increased awareness about the problem of poor indoor air quality. For example, media coverage of indoor air problems has increased the number of informational requests received by NIOSH. Following one network television report on the subject, NIOSH received over 6,000 phone calls and nearly 800 requests for investigations.6\n\nIn addition to indoor air pollutants, BRS also has been found to berelated to work characteristics such as workload, job reorganizations and job satisfaction. Common symptoms associated with BRS include7:\n\nSome people suffer more from the effects of BRS than others. For example, those who work at video display terminals for more than four hours a day miss work due to BRS 20 percent more than those who do not spend as much time at computers.7 According to a study, women miss 1.8 times as many days as men, smokers are absent 1.4 times more days than nonsmokers, and people with allergies miss 1.8 times more days than those without allergies.8"}

Flue gas desulfurization (FGD is the technology used for removing Sulfur dioxide (SO2 from the exhaust flue gases in power plants thatNew Mexico ( is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America.\n\nThere are many substances in the air which may impair the health of plants and animals (including humans), or reduce visibility. These arise both from natural processes and human activity. Substances not naturally found in the air or at greater concentrations or in different locations from usual are referred to as pollutants.\n\nPollutants can be classified as either primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are substances directly emitted from a process, such as ash from a volcanic eruption or the carbon monoxide gas from a motor vehicle exhaust.\n\nSecondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. An important example of a secondary pollutant is ground level ozone - one of the many secondary pollutants that make up photochemical smog.\n\nNote that some pollutants may be both primary and secondary: that is, they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants.\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOx) especially nitrogen dioxide are emitted from high temperature combustion.

Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into an environment that causes instability disorder harm or discomfort to the physical systems or living organisms they are in These factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e. g. , kilograms of particulate emitted per megagram of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency has published a compilation of air pollutant emission factors for a multitude of industrial sources. [5] The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and other countries have published similar compilations, as has the European Environment Agency.

These effects can result in increased medication use, increased doctor or emergency room visits, more hospital admissions and premature death. The\n\nEffects on cystic fibrosis\n\nA study from 1999 to 2000 by the University of Washington showed that patients near and around particulate matter air pollution had an increased risk of pulmonary exacerbations and decrease in lung function. See Washington (disambiguation for other uses The University of Washington, founded in 1861, is a public research University [14] Patients were examined before the study for amounts of specific pollutants like P. aeruginosa or B. cepacia as well as their socioeconomic standing. Participants involved in the study were located in the United States in close proximity to an Environmental Protection Agency . During the time of the study 117 deaths were associated with air pollution. A trend was noticed that patients living closer or in large metropolitan areas to be close to medical help also had higher level of pollutants found in their system because of more emissions in larger cities. With cystic fibrosis patients already being born with decreased lung function everyday pollutants such as smoke emissions from automobiles, tobacco smoke and improper use of indoor heating devices could add to the dissemination of lung function. [15]\n\nEffects on COPD\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include diseases such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and some forms of asthma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is a Disease of the lungs in which the Airways become narrowedBronchitis is an Inflammation of the bronchi (medium-size airways in the Lungs Acute bronchitis is usually caused by VirusesEmphysema is a chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease ( COPD) formerly termed a chronic obstructive Lung disease (COLDAsthma is a chronic Condition involving the Respiratory system in which the airways occasionally constrict become inflamed, and are[16] Two researchers Holland and Reid conducted research on 293 male postal workers in London during the time of the 1952 London Fog incident and 477 male postal workers in the rural setting. The amount of the pollutant FEV1 was significantly lower in urban employees however lung function was decreased due to city pollutions such as car fumes and increased amount of cigarette exposure. [17] It is believed that much like cystic fibrosis, by living in a more urban environment serious health hazards become more apparent. Cystic fibrosis (also known as CF, mucoviscoidosis, or mucoviscidosis) is a hereditary disease affecting the exocrine (mucus glands of the lungs Studies have shown that in urban areas patients suffer mucus hypersecretion, lower levels of lung function, and more self diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. [18]\n\nLondon Fog of 1952\n\nIn the matter of four days a combination of dense fog and sooty black coal smoke came over the London area. [19] The fog was so dense residents of London could not see in front of them. The extreme reduction in visibility was accompanied by an increase in criminal activity as well as transportation delays and a virtual shut down of the city. During the 4 day period of the fog 12,000 are believed to have been killed. [20]\n\nEffects on children\n\nCities around the world with high exposure to air pollutants has the possibility of children living within them to develop asthma, pneumonia and other lower respiratory infections as well as a low initial birth rate. Asthma is a chronic Condition involving the Respiratory system in which the airways occasionally constrict become inflamed, and arePneumonia is an inflammatory illness of the Lung.

The Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, however in 2002 at least 146 million Americans were living in areas that did not meet at least one of the \"criteria pollutants\" laid out in the 1997 National Ambient Air Quality Standards. A Clean Air Act describes one of a number of pieces of legislation relating to the reduction of Smog and Air pollution in general[22] Those pollutants included: ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. Because children are outdoors more and have higher minute ventilation they are more susceptible to the dangers of air pollution.\n\nReduction efforts\n\nThere are various air pollution control technologies and urban planning strategies available to reduce air pollution.\n\nEfforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many developing countries have permissive regulations), expanding regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment, and small gas-powered equipment such as lawn trimmers, chainsaws, and snowmobiles), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of hybrid vehicles), conversion to cleaner fuels (such as bioethanol, biodiesel, or conversion to electric vehicles). A cruise ship or cruise liner is a Passenger ship used for pleasure voyages where the voyage itself and the ship's amenities are part of the experienceA chainsaw (or chain saw) is a portable mechanical motorized Saw.A snowmobile (known locally as snowmachine, snowsled or by the Brandname Ski-Doo) is a land vehicle that is commonly propelled byA hybrid vehicle is a vehicle that uses two or more distinct power sources to propel the vehicleEthanol\n\nControl devices\n\nThe following items are commonly used as pollution control devices by industry or transportation devices. They can either destroy contaminants or remove them from an exhaust stream before it is emitted into the atmosphere. Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into an environment that causes instability disorder harm or discomfort to the physical systems or living organisms they are in\n\nLegal regulation\n\nSmog in Cairo\n\nIn general, there are two types of air quality standards.

Dioxin is a heterocyclic, organic, antiaromatic compoundFuran, also known as furane and furfuran, is a heterocyclic Organic compound. The first class of standards (such as the U. S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards) set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS are standards established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that apply for outdoor Air Environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels. The second class (such as the North American Air Quality Index) take the form of a scale with various thresholds, which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity. The Air Quality Index ( AQI) is a standardized indicator of the Air Quality in a given location The scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants.\n\nCanada\n\nIn Canada, air quality is typically evaluated against standards set by the Canadian Council of Minister for the Environment (CCME), an inter-governmental body of federal, provincial and territorial Ministers responsible for the environment. The CCME has set Canada Wide Standards(CWS). [23][24] These are:\n\nCWS for ozone = 65 ppb (8-hour averaging time, by year 2010, achievement is based on the 4th highest measurement annually, averaged over 3 consecutive years.\n\nNote that there is no consequence in Canada to not achieving these standards. In addition, these only apply to jurisdictions with populations greater than 100,000. Further, provinces and territories may set more stringent standards than those set by the CCME.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nNational Emission Ceilings (NEC) for certain atmospheric pollutants are regulated by Directive 2001\/81\/EC (NECD). [25] As part of the preparatory work associated with the revision of the NECD, the European Commission is assisted by the NECPI working group (National Emission Ceilings \u2013 Policy Instruments). The European Commission (formally the Commission of the European Communities) is the executive branch of the European Union.[26]\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nAir quality targets set by the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) are mostly aimed at local government representatives responsible for the management of air quality in cities, where air quality management is the most urgent. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra) is the United Kingdom government department responsible for environmental protection The UK has established an air quality network where levels of the key air pollutants[27] are published by monitoring centers. [28] Air quality in Oxford, Bath and London[29] is particularly poor. Oxford is currently bidding for the 2010 Wikimania Conference Oxford () is a city, and the County town of Oxfordshire,Bath is a city in Somerset in the south west of England It is situated west of London and south-east of Bristol.London ( \u02c8l\u028cnd\u0259n is the capital and largest urban area in the United Kingdom. One controversial study[30] performed by the Calor Gas company and published in the Guardian newspaper compared walking in Oxford on an average day to smoking over sixty light cigarettes.

The UK National Air Quality Information Archive offers almost real-time monitoring of \"current maximum\" air pollution measurements for many UK towns and cities. [33] This source offers a wide range of constantly updated data, including:\n\nHourly Mean Ozone (\u00b5g\/m\u00b3)\n\nHourly Mean Nitrogen dioxide (\u00b5g\/m\u00b3)\n\nMaximum 15-Minute Mean Sulphur dioxide (\u00b5g\/m\u00b3)\n\n8-Hour Mean Carbon monoxide (mg\/m\u00b3)\n\n24-Hour Mean PM10 (\u00b5g\/m\u00b3 Grav Equiv)\n\nDEFRA acknowledges that air pollution has a significant effect on health and has produced a simple banding index system[34] is used to create a daily warning system that is issued by the BBC Weather Service to indicate air pollution levels. [35] DEFRA has published guidelines for people suffering from respiratory and heart diseases. [36]\n\nUnited States\n\nLooking down from the Hollywood Hills, with Griffith Observatory on the hill in the foreground, air pollution is visible in downtown Los Angeles on a late afternoon. The Hollywood Hills, an unofficial designation of part of Los Angeles, California, United States, are part of the eastern section of the low transverseGriffith Observatory is located in Los Angeles California, United States.Los Angeles (l\u0251\u02c8s\u00e6nd\u0292\u0259l\u0259s los \u02c8a\u014bxeles in Spanish) is the largest City in the state of California and the American West\n\nIn the 1960s, 70s, and 90s, the United States Congress enacted a series of Clean Air Acts which significantly strengthened regulation of air pollution. The United States Congress is the bicameral Legislature of the federal government of the United States of America, consisting of two housesA Clean Air Act describes one of a number of pieces of legislation relating to the reduction of Smog and Air pollution in general Individual U. S. states, some European nations and eventually the European Union followed these initiatives. The European Union ( EU) is a political and economic union of twenty-seven member states, located primarily in The Clean Air Act sets numerical limits on the concentrations of a basic group of air pollutants and provide reporting and enforcement mechanisms.\n\nIn 1999, the United States EPA replaced the Pollution Standards Index (PSI) with the Air Quality Index (AQI) to incorporate new PM2. The Air Quality Index ( AQI) is a standardized indicator of the Air Quality in a given location 5 and Ozone standards.\n\nThe effects of these laws have been very positive. In the United States between 1970 and 2006, citizens enjoyed the following reductions in annual pollution emissions:[37]\n\ncarbon monoxide emissions fell from 197 million tons to 89 million tons\n\nnitrogen oxide emissions fell from 27 million tons to 19 million tons\n\nsulfur dioxide emissions fell from 31 million tons to 15 million tons\n\nparticulate emissions fell by 80%\n\nlead emissions fell by more than 98%\n\nIn an October 2006 letter to EPA, the agency's independent scientific advisors warned that the ozone smog standard \"needs to be substantially reduced\" and that there is \"no scientific justification\" for retaining the current, weaker standard. The scientists unanimously recommended a smog threshold of 60 to 70 ppb after they conducted an extensive review of the evidence. [38]\n\nThe EPA has proposed, in June 2007, a new threshold of 75 ppb. This falls short of the scientific recommendation, but is an improvement over the current standard.\n\nPolluting industries are lobbying to keep the current (weaker) standards in place. Environmentalists and public health advocates are mobilizing to support compliance with the scientific recommendations.\n\nThe National Ambient Air Quality Standards are pollution thresholds which trigger mandatory remediation plans by state and local governments, subject to enforcement by the EPA.

The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS are standards established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that apply for outdoor Air Air pollution is a health concern even in developed countries like the U. S.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion\n\nThe basic technology for analyzing air pollution is through the use of a variety of mathematical models for predicting the transport of air pollutants in the lower atmosphere. Atmospheric dispersion modeling is the mathematical simulation of how air pollutants disperse in the ambient atmosphere.Note The term model has a different meaning in Model theory, a branch of Mathematical logic. The principal methodologies are:\n\nPoint source dispersion, used for industrial sources. Air pollution dispersion terminology describes the words and Technical terms that have a special meaning to those who work in the field of Air pollution dispersion modeling\n\nVisualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollution dispersion plume as used in many atmospheric dispersion models\n\nThe point source problem is the best understood, since it involves simpler mathematics and has been studied for a long period of time, dating back to about the year 1900. Air pollution dispersion terminology describes the words and Technical terms that have a special meaning to those who work in the field of Air pollution dispersion modeling Roadway air dispersion modeling is the study of Air pollutant transport from a roadway or other linear emitterAir pollution dispersion terminology describes the words and Technical terms that have a special meaning to those who work in the field of Air pollution dispersion modelingA wildfire, also known as a wildland fire, forest fire, brush fire, vegetation fire, grass fire, Peat fire,Photochemistry, a sub-discipline of Chemistry, is the study of the interactions between Atoms, small Molecules, and light (or Electromagnetic radiationSmog is a kind of Air pollution; the word &quotsmog&quot is a Portmanteau of Smoke and Fog. It uses a Gaussian dispersion model for buoyant pollution plumes to forecast the air pollution isopleths, with consideration given to wind velocity, stack height, emission rate and stability class (a measure of atmospheric turbulence). Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 &ndash 1855 is the Eponym of all of the topics listed belowA contour line (also Level set, isopleth, isoline, isogram or isarithm) of a function of twoIn Fluid dynamics, turbulence or turbulent flow is a fluid regime characterized by chaotic Stochastic property changes[42][43] This model has been extensively validated and calibrated with experimental data for all sorts of atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe roadway air dispersion model was developed starting in the late 1950s and early 1960s in response to requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the U.S. Department of Transportation (then known as the Federal Highway Administration) to understand impacts of proposed new highways upon air quality, especially in urban areas. Roadway air dispersion modeling is the study of Air pollutant transport from a roadway or other linear emitterThe National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA) is a United States environmental law that was signed into law on January 1, 1970 by UThe United States Department of Transportation ( DOT) is a federal Cabinet department of the United States government concerned with Transportation Several research groups were active in this model development, among which were: the Environmental Research and Technology (ERT) group in Lexington, Massachusetts, the ESL Inc. Lexington is a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. group in Sunnyvale, California and the California Air Resources Board group in Sacramento, California. Sunnyvale ( or) is a city in Santa Clara County, California, United States.The California Air Resources Board, also known as ( CARB) is the &quotclean air agency&quot in the Government of California. The research of the ESL group received a boost with a contract award from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to validate a line source model using sulfur hexafluoride as a tracer gas. Sulfur hexafluoride is an Inorganic compound with the formula. This program was successful in validating the line source model developed by ESL inc. Some of the earliest uses of the model were in court cases involving highway air pollution, the Arlington, Virginia portion of Interstate 66 and the New Jersey Turnpike widening project through East Brunswick, New Jersey. Interstate 66 (I-66 is an Interstate highway in the eastern United States.The New Jersey Turnpike (or simply The Turnpike as it is known to New Jersey residents is a Toll road in New Jersey and is one of the most heavily traveledThis article is about the township in New Jersey for the suburb in Melbourne Victoria see Brunswick East Victoria East Brunswick is a Suburban\n\nArea source models were developed in 1971 through 1974 by the ERT and ESL groups, but addressed a smaller fraction of total air pollution emissions, so that their use and need was not as widespread as the line source model, which enjoyed hundreds of different applications as early as the 1970s. Similarly photochemical models were developed primarily in the 1960s and 1970s, but their use was more specialized and for regional needs, such as understanding smog formationEnvironmental impacts\n\nThe greenhouse effect is a phenomenon whereby greenhouse gases, create a condition in the upper atmosphere causing a trapping of heat and leading to increased surface and lower tropospheric temperatures. The Greenhouse effect refers to the change in the Thermal equilibrium temperature of a planet or moon by the presence of an Atmosphere containing gas that absorbsThe Greenhouse effect refers to the change in the Thermal equilibrium temperature of a planet or moon by the presence of an Atmosphere containing gas that absorbsGreenhouse gases are gaseous constituents of the atmosphere bothnatural and anthropogenic that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of thermal infraredTemperature and layers The temperature of the Earth's atmosphere varies with altitude the mathematical relationship between temperature and altitude varies among fiveIn Physics, heat, symbolized by Q, is Energy transferred from one body or system to another due to a difference in Temperature The troposphere is the lowest portion of Earth's atmosphere.

Currently, scientists are studying the role of changes in composition of greenhouse gases from natural and anthropogenic sources for the effect on climate change. Climate change is any long-term significant change in the \"average weather\" that a given region experiences\n\nA number of studies have also investigated the potential for long-term rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to cause slight increases in the acidity of ocean waters and the possible effects of this on marine ecosystems. However, carbonic acid is a very weak acid, and is utilized by marine organisms during photosynthesis.

{"text":"Monitoring Air Quality\n\nParks and the Clean Air Act\n\nThe goal of the 1970 Clean Air Act is safe and acceptable ambient air quality. The Act directs that \"Primary\" air standards be set to protect public health. \"Secondary\" standards protect the national welfare including resources and values found in the national parks.\n\nThe Act seeks to \"prevent the significant deterioration\" of air quality, particularly in areas of special natural, scenic, or historic values. These regions are classified as \"class I areas\" and include many western national parks, one of which is Big Bend.\n\nBy enacting clean air legislation, Congress expressed the national desire to preserve the scenic values we have come to expect in our national parks.\n\nIn spite of Big Bend's remote location and presumed immunity to such urban problems as air pollution, noticeable changes in the park's air quality appeared during the 1970s. In response to this impending threat, park managers began an air monitoring program in 1978. After years of data collection and analysis, researchers are now able to interpret the transport and transformation of pollutants that contribute to the park's reduced visibility.\n\nMonitoring Program\n\nBig Bend's monitoring program includes many data collection systems:\n\n1. Transmissometer - a device that sends a light beam across the desert to a collection monitor for 10 minutes each hour, measuring the amount of light blocked, absorbed, or deflected by air pollution.\n\n2. Aerosol Sampler - a \"vacuum cleaner\" inhales air for 24 hours twice per week. Filters are analyzed for substances such as sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, and soil.\n\n3. Nephelometer - Fires a measured beam of light through a sample of ambient air to determine how much light is scattered due to pollution.\n\n4. Automated Camera System - a permanently mounted camera that takes photos of the same distant scene at 9:00 am, 12 noon, and 3:00 pm each day, providing a daily account of visibility. One camera posts a picture to the Park's website every 15 minutes.\n\n5. Precipitation Chemistry Analysis - part of a nationwide system which monitors changes in the chemistry and acid content of precipitation. Big Bend has participated in this program since 1980.\n\n6.

The presence of moisture in air ducts\nalso leads to the perfect breeding ground for mold, dust mites and debris\naccumulation.\n\nIf these conditions exist in the ductwork, household members\nand even pets breathe in bad air as the HVAC system distributes air throughout\nthe home. Also, the quality of indoor\nair suffers if there is not enough air ventilation inside a building. Children,\nthe elderly and those who are prone to allergies are at a great risk of\nbecoming sick from breathing in poor indoor air. This is why Palmdale\nhomeowners who have problems with their indoor air quality often consider having\nthe air ducts in their homes cleaned.\n\nImproving Indoor Air in Condos\n\nIf you reside in a condo where the duct system is extensive,\nit is important to have the HVAC systems cleaned regularly to keep indoor air\nhealthy. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also advises condo residents\nwho use fuel-burning furnaces to have their units inspected and serviced before\nthe heating season begins to ensure proper functioning and prevent carbon\nmonoxide poisoning. The HVAC system will also become more efficient if the\ncooling coils, heat exchangers and fans are cleaned.\n\nIn addition, Palmdale dryer vent cleaning can also\ncontribute to healthy indoor air, not to mention reduce the risk of fire. A\ndryer's lint trap does not get all the lint and what escapes accumulate into a significant\namount that enters the vent system. The build up of lint, which is highly\nflammable, creates a fire hazard which is why regular Palmdale dryer vent\ncleaning is required by many insurance companies.\n\nFortunately, condo residents just like regular homeowners can\nalso have Palmdale dryer vent cleaning and Palmdale furnace cleaning done in\ntheir units in addition to Palmdale air duct cleaning. In response to the\ngrowing need for improved indoor air quality, the number of companies offering\nPalmdale air duct cleaning services has increased in recent years. Usually,\nthese companies also provide Palmdale furnace cleaning and Palmdale vent\ncleaning.\n\nChoosing a Reputable Contractor\n\nUnfortunately, some air duct cleaning Palmdale contractors\ndo not have adequate knowledge about HVAC system operation and duct construction\nor have not kept up to speed with the most current methods and technologies in\nair duct cleaning. Be aware that if the ductwork in your home is not cleaned\nadequately and effectively, it would worsen any problems you may already have\nwith your indoor air quality which could lead to health complaints.\n\nFor these reasons, it is important to choose a reputable\nprofessional Palmdale air duct cleaning company who not only has a proven track\nrecord of providing satisfactory service but also uses the latest equipment\ntechnology available in duct cleaning.\n\nDo You Need Palmdale Air Duct Cleaning Service?\n\nIf your answer to all of the questions below is \"yes\", then\nyou do need to hire a Palmdale air duct cleaning contractor:\n\n\u00b7\n\nDoes the\nductwork have visible contamination?\n\n\u00b7\n\nHave you used expert testing or assessment to\nconfirm the type and scale of contamination that exists in the ductwork?\n\n\u00b7\n\nCan the pollutants enter the occupied spaces in\nyour home?\n\n\u00b7\n\nHave you determined and controlled the cause of\ncontamination?\n\n\u00b7\n\nWill the contamination\nbe eliminated or neutralized effectively through professional Palmdale air duct\ncleaning?\n\n\u00b7\n\nHave you looked\nat other solutions?\n\nIf you are considering cleaning the air ducts in your home but\nis mostly undecided about it, talk to an industry professional like the\ncontractor that services your HVAC unit. They may be able to offer you good\nadvice on the value of professional air duct cleaning. It's also a good idea to\nspeak with a professional air duct cleaning Palmdale contractor about their\nservices. Of course they will try to sell their service to you but reputable\ncontractors would also educate you about what they do."}
{"text":"Helping you diagnose and remove black mold...\n\nWhat is Black Mold?\n\nMolds are a type of fungus that reproduces asexually using spores. Some types of mold can grow indoors under certain conditions, using surfaces with a high cellulose content, such as wood, paper products or even carpets, as a substrate. Many types of mold may be present in the home, but the most infamous type of mold infestation is known as black mold. Black mold, also called toxic black mold, refers to the species Stachybotrys chartarum, which is also known as S. atra. This type of mold has a dark green or black appearance and has a habit of growing on drywall and wallpaper in homes.\n\nSo What is Black Mold?\n\nToxic black mold earned its name due to its association with certain health problems. Molds in the home produce allergenic spores that can decrease air quality and some produce mycotoxins that can have ill effects on health. In people with weak immune systems due to other health problems, molds may be involved in an opportunistic fungal infection. The lungs of people who are ill are specifically susceptible to fungal infections of the lungs and related complications, such as a type of fungal pneumonia.\n\nBlack mold specifically is related to allergies and chronic respiratory problems. Some individuals can have a severe allergic reaction upon exposure to mold spores. Black mold has also been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. The severity of the symptoms of black mold exposure are related to the extent of the mold infestation of the home, the length of exposure to the mold and the sensitivity of the residents of the home to mold. Some people are more likely to experience allergic symptoms upon mold exposure than others.\n\nThe toxic black mold species S. chartarum may be linked to more severe health problems than most other mold species that may invade the home, such as Aspergillus or Alternaria. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocates home mold removal for all species of mold, however, because the spores of many species may cause allergic rhinitis in sensitive individuals. Mold spores are very similar to pollen grains in that they are numerous, airborne and very allergenic.\n\nThe best approach to mold removal is to control the humidity of the indoor environment, because molds require a high level of humidity to grow and reproduce. If mold growing on home surfaces is removed and the humidity is still high, it is likely that the spores in the air will allow the mold to recolonize and the infestation may come back just as strongly as before. Dehumidifiers can help control the humidity of the air inside of a building. The mold itself can usually be easily removed with a bleach solution or a mold remover; the spores are harder to get rid of, but controlling the humidity can prevent them from growing into mold. If the mold damage to the home is extensive, professional mold remediation may be necessary to remove the mold and repair the damaged structures in the building."}

Sending airplanes and weather balloons outfitted with instruments up in the air, the team will be sampling aerosols in the Sacramento Valley from June 2-28.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington will be leading the monthlong study, coordinating air and ground operations at three sites in the Central Valley. Participating scientists hail from several DOE national laboratories, NASA and the University of California, Davis, along with many other academic and research institutions. The data they are collecting will help researchers improve computer models that simulate the climate and project climate changes.\n\nOne of the areas of climate science that researchers know the least about is aerosols, the tiny particles of dust, soot, salts, water and other chemicals suspended in the air. A hazy day? That is mainly caused by aerosol particles scattering and absorbing sunlight.\n\nTo better understand aerosols' role in climate, the DOE's climate research program studies how aerosol particles in the air scatter and absorb the sun's radiation, and how much of it hits Earth.\n\nThis Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility study, called the Carbonaceous Aerosols and Radiative Effects Study (CARES), is looking at aerosols that have a bit of black carbon and organic chemicals in them. These can come from vehicle exhaust, fires -- even plants give off carbon-containing compounds that find their way into aerosols.\n\nThe team of researchers will take daily measurements of trace gases and aerosols the city emits -- known as the Sacramento urban plume -- under relatively well-defined and regular weather conditions. The knowledge gained will eventually be used in regional and global computer models that simulate the effects of aerosols on climate.\n\nAbout half of the researchers will take measurements on the ground at two sites - one at American River College in Sacramento and the other at Northside School in Cool, Calif. The rest of the team will take similar measurements from the air using a full payload of instruments -- some recently purchased with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds -- flown on a Gulfstream-1 aircraft at about 1,000 feet. NASA will fly a King Air B-200 above the G-1 at 28,000 feet.\n\nIn addition, the team will be sending weather balloons up for additional sampling from the ground sites. The simultaneous measurements from ground, plane and balloon will provide a comprehensive view of the atmospheric aerosols.\n\nRelated StoriesAs climate change scientists develop ever more sophisticated climate models to project an expected path of temperature change, it is becoming increasingly important to include the effects of aerosols on clouds, according ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A team of researchers from eight institutions led by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has solved a software and hardware problem that had perplexed scientists studying atmospheric aerosols"}
{"text":"Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) usually refers to treatment of the air in your home to control humidity levels (up or down) and most importantly to clean contaminants from the air. It should be noted that this applies to forced-air systems, but also to homes heated with forced hot water.\n\nIt is common to install a simple mesh air filter on a furnace, and do nothing else to improve the air quality within a building. In tightly-sealed houses, the lack of fresh air introduction and purification of the existing air can actually be dangerous, but even older homes should have proper air purification. And proper humidity levels keep us warmer in the winter, cooler in the summer, and can help protect our breathing health as well as our wood furniture.\n\nThere is no \"one size fits all\" IAQ system for all situations. Sometimes it's fresh air that is needed, and a vent can be added to the system with proper controls to introduce fresh air without harming efficiency by creating a cold draft in the winter or a hot draft in the summer. Other times, a more efficient air filter will trap more dust, pollen, and mold that otherwise would get blown around by your furnace. For better filtration, especially in cases when the owners or occupants suffer from allergies, ultraviolet and\/or HEPA filters may be used to destroy and capture contaminants.\n\nHumidifiers and dehumidifiers are important in most cases. Dry winter air makes us more susceptible to cold\/flu infections by irritating the nasal passages and lungs, which humid summer air makes the heat feel even more uncomfortable and can lead to mildew and mold growth. Proper humidity levels will extend the life of wood furniture and improve health and comfort.\n\nAs mentioned at the top of the page, these improvements are not just for forced-air systems. Homes without ductwork can be fitted with standalone air purification, humidification, and dehumidification systems.\n\nFrom simple improvements to reduce dirt and dust levels in a house, to a complete HEPA, ultraviolet, humidification and dehumidification package, we can provide you with better air quality and a healthier home or office.\n\nUse our contact form, email us directly, or call us (942-2028) today for a free consultation to discuss your needs!"}

{"text":"Does polluting of the environment cause autism?\n\nContact with polluting of the environment in utero or throughout the very first year of existence may double an individual's chance of developing autism, based on research carried out by scientists in the College of Los Angeles (USC) and Children's Hospital La.\n\n\"The work has broad potential public health implications,\" lead investigator Louise Volk stated. \"We have noted for a very long time that polluting of the environment isn't good for the lung area, and particularly for kids. We are now starting to know how polluting of the environment may modify the brain.\"\n\nThe scientists believed contact with polluting of the environment throughout each trimester of being pregnant and throughout the very first year of existence among 279 individuals with autism and 245 men and women without autism, all whom were participants within the California-based Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and also the Atmosphere (CHARGE) study. Exposure was calculated using addresses indexed by residential histories as well as on the participants' birth certificates. The scientists then believed regional polluting of the environment levels using data in the Environment Protection Agency's Quality Of Air System. The scientists then used polluting of the environment data to calculate participants' contact with three specific contaminants: nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter less than 10 microns across (PM10), and particulate less than 2.5 microns across (PM2.5).\n\nAdditionally, the scientists used dispersion models to calculate just how much polluting of the environment the participants had likely been uncovered to by local traffic. The research is the first one to take a look at exposure not just in regional pollution, but additionally to that particular produced by local traffic. The result is a previous study through the same scientists that looked limited to the correlation between autism risk and residence distance from the freeway.\n\n\"We required into consideration how far people resided from streets, meteorology for example which way the wind was coming, how busy the street was, along with other factors to review traffic-related pollution,\" she stated. \"We examined data from quality of air monitors, which measure pollution on the bigger region that may originate from traffic, industry, rail yards, or a number of other sources.\"\n\nAll kinds of pollution are harmfulThe scientists discovered that contact with both local and regional polluting of the environment \u2013 in almost any trimester of being pregnant or throughout the very first year of existence \u2013 considerably elevated the chance of autism. Contact with polluting of the environment from local traffic a lot more than bending the chance of autism, while contact with NO2, PM10 or PM2.5 from regional polluting of the environment also elevated the danger, even even without the local contaminants.\n\nThe discovering that PM10 and PM2.5 both elevated risk was particularly interesting, the scientists noted, because prior research has established the finer PM2.5 contaminants tend to be more dangerous towards the body.\n\n\"From studies carried out within the lab, we all know that people can inhale small contaminants plus they can establish inflammation,\" Volk stated. \"Contaminants have varied composition, and you will find many chemicals that may bind for them. The constituents of those contaminants might be hazardous towards the brain.\"\n\nThe research was funded through the National Institute of Environment Health Sciences and released within the Archives of General Psychiatry."}

{"text":"Runners experience life to its fullest. We feel the heat of the sun and the bite of the wind more intimately than those who shake their heads at us from their car windows. Our hearts, lungs, and muscles strain and improve with our efforts. As we suck up the marrow of life, however, we bring thousands of liters of air into our lungs-air that may be dangerously fouled by pollutants. In fact, urban runners are exposed to much greater quantities of air pollution than sedentary folks due to the large volumes of air we breathe while running.\n\nParticularly in summer, the prudent runner living in or near a city will check local air quality conditions daily. Pollution episodes are often caused by a temperature inversion in which warm polluted air becomes trapped between 2 layers of cooler air. The inversion layer prevents pollutants from dispersing in the upper atmosphere. Summer is also a time for discretion because exercising in the heat increases the detrimental effects of air pollution. Although the mechanism is poorly understood, heat and pollution together cause greater reductions in lung function and running performance than does pollution alone.\n\nThe most common types of air pollutants that affect distance running performance are ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. The body's response to pollution is related to the concentration of the pollutant, and how much air is inhaled. There is a large degree of individual variability in responsiveness to pollution, and asthmatic runners should seek professional medical advice. Let's take a look at the 3 most common villains in our air.\n\nCarbon Monoxide (CO) is formed from burning oil, gas, coal, and wood, and is the most common air pollutant in our cities. Because its primary source is automobile emissions, carbon monoxide exposure is particularly high near urban highways. Carbon monoxide attaches to hemoglobin in your red blood cells which reduces the amount of oxygen transported to your muscles. Scientific evidence indicates that running in carbon monoxide concentrations > 25 parts per million can reduce your VO2 max and impair your running performance.\n\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2) is produced by power plants, smelters, refineries, and other industries. Running in sulfur dioxide concentrations > 0.5 ppm is likely to cause bronchoconstriction, wheezing, and chest tightness in asthmatics. Although sulfur dioxide concentrations typically found in U.S. cities do not generally cause symptoms in non-asthmatic runners, symptoms may occur during high intensity workouts or races.\n\nLittle is known about the chronic effects of exercise in a polluted environment. Lawrence Folinsbee, Ph.D., who has studied exercise and air pollution for over 15 years, acknowledges that more research is needed to determine the relationship between lung function and habitual exposure to air pollution in athletes. Dr. Folinsbee cautions, however, that runners who regularly train in polluted air may experience long-term changes in lung function.\n\nThe best strategy for dealing with pollution is to avoid it. A Minnesotan wouldn't go for a run in the winter without checking the temperature, and a Floridian wouldn't run at noon in the summer. Similarly, urban runners should make a habit of considering the environmental conditions. Read the paper, listen to the radio, or scan the internet to check the air quality where you live."}

{"text":"Posts Tagged 'Mold' realized\n\nMold is a functioning part of an environmental ecosystem, playing an important part in the breakdown and decay of dead organic matters such as fallen leaves or dead trees. But when mold manages to grow indoors, it can place a serious strain on both human health and household finances. Mold spreads by producing tiny spores that are invisible to the naked eye. These microscopic spores float through the air and are then ingested or inhaled. When these tiny spores locate a moist area they take root and start to grow. There are many types of mold, none can survive without a constant source of water.\n\nOnce Mold sets in and begins to proliferate in the home environment. Black Mold is a type ofmold that has been proven to have serious effects on human health. Black Mold is a mycotoxin, during the digestion of organic matter, the fungi secrete enzymes into nutrients in order to break down complex compounds into simpler compounds that can be ingested by the mold and used as nutrition.These digested nutrients produce secondary metabolic waste called mycotoxins that are released to give the mold a competitive edge over other organisms. Inhaling or coming into contact with black mold or black mold spores can produce severe cold or flu like symptoms, including running nose, itching, red or watery eyes, fatigue, memory loss, excessive mucous discharge, dermatitis, skin rash, stomach upset, harsh allergic reactions and more. Symptoms may be immediate or build up slowly over a period time. Those who already have taxed immune systems or are asthmatic may be at a higher risk of infections but healthy individuals are in no way immune. Research is still being done to determine just how far reaching exposure to black mold has on human health, but studies show that the negative effects are far reaching. For more detailed information consult a health professional or your state and local health departments.\n\nOnce it is discovered that there is black mold in your living environment, it is important to totally eradicate it. Floating, airborne spores come from outdoors, on pets, or on hair and clothing of individuals who enter in from outside. Ventilation systems and open windows are also open pathways and allow for spore invasion. However, these spores will not take root and become active unless there is a source of longstanding moisture present in the home. If there is black mold found growing in a home, repair the source of the moisture and clean the affected area and allow it to dry thoroughly. Dispose of any infested materials such as wood, porous tiles and drywall. If the moisture is not removed black mold can grow back. Molds can grow on cloth, carpets, leather, wood, sheetrock, insulation and pantry foods. It is a myth that mold can only grow in dark places. All molds that appear black are not of this dangerous variety, it's hard to differentiate among them withoutThe InFormant 15 Minute Black Mold Detection Kit (Formerly known as AdVantage). Regardless of the type of mold you may have, the Center for Disease Control recommends removing it as soon as possible from your living or working environment.

How many people are likely to occupy one room at a given time? That's key information, because every new person is adding CO2 load to the room with every exhalation. Research published in Environmental Health Perspectives found that once CO2 exceeds the standard 600 ppm used for most ventilation standards, performance goes downhill rapidly. At 1,000 ppm CO2, they found \"moderate and statistically significant decrements in six of nine scales of decision-making performance. At 2,500 ppm large and statistically significant reductions occurred in seven scales of decision-making performance.\" They conclude that \"Direct adverse effects of CO2 on human performance may be economically important and may limit energy-saving reductions in outdoor air ventilation per person in buildings.\"\n\nHold on. Before we toss out years of building science to freshen the air, the technology already exists to provide a fix that's efficient.

First, they studied data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, which examined links between heart health and sleeping patterns of more than 6,000 people between 1995 and 1998.\n\nThen, they compared that data to EPA air pollution data in 7 cities: Framingham (Mass.), Minneapolis, New York City, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Sacramento, and Tucson. All in all, they studied more than 3,000 people, making sure to adjust for different factors, such as age, gender and smoking habits.\n\nWhat they found is incidents of sleep apnea and low levels of oxygen during sleep increase as the temperature increases during all seasons of the year. Breathing troubles during sleep also increased in the summer as air pollution increased, too. Sleep apnea is the most well-known form of breathing-related sleep disorders. It causes those affected to wake up repeatedly when their airways constrict and breathing is cut off.\n\nThe study\u2014a first of its kind\u2014was conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham & Women's Hospital, and it was funded by the EPA, US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, and the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. You can read a full report in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.\n\n2 Comments\n\nI was diagnosed with sleep apnea a few years ago. I had never realized that it was a bit worse in the summer than in the fall. Well this explains it. I use a CPAP machine right now, and it has definitely helped me sleep easier. I hope as we all become more green conscious, those actions will help as well.\n\nI wonder how this compares with people who suffer from allergies. I guess pollution can affect breathing in much the same way. As a lifelong allergy sufferer, I can say it definitely interferes with sleep, breathing, etc and it also gets worse during the summer. Maybe those who have allergies also are sensitive to pollution.\n\nOther Greenfudge.org postsWhen he first bought the 1972 MGB roadster back in 1984 in order to restore it, Dr. Roger Dougal probably never thought it would take more than 20 years before he actually started his project.

Its composition depends on\n\nOCR for page 68\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nthe emitting sources or particle precursors and also on atmospheric conditions. Some PM components\u2014Including nitrate species, organic species, and water\u2014are semivolatile and repartition between the gas and particle phase depending on environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity, or the composition of the PM. For modeling and monitoring purposes the composition of dry atmospheric PM is generally reduced to a few major categories. Commonly identified components include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, elemental or black carbon, sea salt, soil or crustal material, and specific elements of interest, such as Pb. The health effects associated with exposure to these individual components are not well characterized and are likely to vary signficantly.\nPrimary and Secondary Sources PM is emitted from both natural and anthropogenic sources, and its components are both primary (directly emitted) and secondary (formed in the atmosphere). Direct natural emissions come from wildfires, sea spray, and resuspension of organic matter such as leaf litter. The first of these produces primarily PM2.5, while the latter two are mainly PM10. Mineral dust has both natural and anthropogenic origins: it is lofted from arid and semiarid regions and can be mobilized by agricultural or construction activities. Its emission rates are especially susceptible to climate conditions. Combustion of fossil fuels and biofuels is a large primary anthropogenic source. Combustion processes are the only sources of black carbon, which together with \"brown\" carbon1 has an important role in PM light absorption. Sources of secondary PM precursors (gases leading to particulate matter through atmospheric reactions) include gaseous vegetative emissions, motor vehicle emissions, and wood-smoke emissions. Reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds are oxidized to the particulate components sulfate and nitrate, respectively. Ammonium is a common cation (positively charged ion) incorporated from the gas phase into the particle phase to neutralize these acid secondary species, although sodium, calcium, and other cations derived from sea salt or minerals are also often present.\nMass or Number? Regulations and many measurement strategies have focused on characterizing the mass concentrations of PM, but for some health and welfare effects size or number concentrations may be the more relevant characteristic. This question is still unresolved. As discussed above PM differs from gaseous pollutants because it is a complex mixture with\n1\n\"Black carbon\" refers to combustion-generated carbonacous aerosol that strongly absorbs visible light. \"Brown carbon\" refers to carbonaceous particles that are optically in between strongly absorbing black carbon and nonabsorbing organic carbon, formed largely by inefficient combustion of hydrocarbons.\n\nOCR for page 69\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nwide variations in chemical composition and particle sizes. Their chemical composition reflects the particles' origin as well as processing that has occurred during their lifetimes in the atmosphere. This report focuses mainly on particles with aerodynamic diameters below 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) because they can be transported over much longer distances than larger particles, and because they have stronger effects on the health and environmental impacts of interest. Further, we focus on the regulated and therefore most available observed properties, mass concentrations, and bulk chemical compositions of PM, noting that other properties may assume more importance in the future as understanding of PM effects increases and regulations are accordingly revised. For example, PM acts as a vehicle for the atmospheric transport and inhalation of toxic substances such as heavy metals (Murphy et al., 2007) and PAHs (see Chapter 5).\nThe chemical composition of PM2.5 offers clues to its sources and atmospheric chemistry, and chemical characterization is critical to understanding the environmental impacts of present and future sources. Numerous measurements of PM composition have been published (Kim et al., 2000; Edgerton et al., 2006; Ondov et al., 2006). These are complemented by measurements of various components of PM emitted by specific sources (Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Watson et al., 2001; EPA, 2006b), including advanced measurements that characterize individual particles (Sodeman et al., 2005).\nMass concentrations of each species and size fraction are measured and reported using operational definitions and techniques (generally filter based) (e.g., Pitchford et al., 2007), which give an idea of the overall dry composition of the sampled size fraction. It is important to bear in mind that water can be the dominant (and unmeasured) PM constituent above ~ 90 percent relative humidity and sampling and analysis difficulties are known to be present for elemental carbon, organic carbon, and nitrate species, making their routine quantification less certain. More sophisticated measurements that are applied in intensive field studies are able to provide better characterization of the PM than that possible from filters, such as the mixing state of species within individual particles (Murphy et al., 2006) and the presence of trace quantities of toxic species (Moffet et al., 2008).\nIn this chapter we favor the use of the word \"baseline\" to indicate a potentially observable quantity that represents the cleanest 20 percent of daily surface observations. The word \"background\" implies an atmospheric concentration that occurs in the absence of modern anthropogenic sources; while models may be used to provide such a distinction, measurements are presently indifferent to this fractionation.\n\nOCR for page 70\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nSOURCES OF PARTICULATE MATTER\nFigure 3.1 shows the major sources of primary emissions of PM2.5 in the United States. Major components of these particles include sulfate, nitrate, black carbon, organic carbon, and mineral dust; the latter two are themselves complex mixtures. Figure 3.2 summarizes the global sources of major non dust PM components, including sources leading to secondary production of sulfate, nitrogen, and organic PM components. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursor gases may originate naturally from plants (biogenic emissions) (Guenther et al., 2000), from open burning of biomass (Grieshop et al., 2008), or from energy-related sources (Robinson et al., 2007). Neither the reactions nor the exact compounds leading to formation of SOA are fully understood (Donahue et al., 2009), as demonstrated in recent comparisons of modeling and observations (e.g., Heald et al., 2006).\nWe note that the commonly measured major components included in Figure 3.2 do not fully characterize the often complex chemical nature of PM, and some of the minor species present are known to be toxic to humans or the environment. For example, the organic carbon fraction may contain POPs (see Chapter 5), a category that encompasses pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, among other toxic species. Many metals have been detected in PM, including lead, zinc, mercury, and vanadium (e.g., Moffet et al., 2008). While these elements generally contribute only minimally to total\nFIGURE 3.1 National primary emissions of PM2.5 by sector.\nSOURCE: EPA, \n\nOCR for page 71\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nFIGURE 3.2 Global sources of PM2.5 components and precursors.

A European study using exposure-response functions for a 10 \u03bcg m\u20133 increase in PM10 found that this increase\n\nOCR for page 72\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\naccounted for 6 percent of total mortality, as well as more than 25,000 new cases of chronic bronchitis in adults, more than 290,000 episodes of bronchitis in children, more than 500,000 asthma attacks, and more than 16 million person-days of restricted activities in Austria, France, and Switzerland (K\u00fcnzli et al., 2000). Health effects have been observed at all exposure concentrations, indicating a wide range of susceptibility and that some people are at risk even at the lower end of observed concentrations. There is convincing and consistent evidence that short- and long-term exposures to particulate matter can cause a wide range of adverse health effects. Effects related to short-term exposure include lung inflammatory reactions, respiratory symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, increase in medication usage, and increase in mortality. Effects related to long-term exposure include increase in lower respiratory symptoms, reduction in lung function in children and adults, increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and reduction in life expectancy due mainly to cardiopulmonary mortality but also to lung cancer (WHO, 2006).\nFigure 3.3 shows summary estimates for relative risks for mortality caused by different air pollutants. Particulate mass, particularly the mass in the smaller particles (e.g., PM2.5), show the highest relative risk for mortality. It remains unclear what components or characteristics are responsible for observed adverse health effects, with hypotheses including the presence of metals, sulfates, and other acidic species, or simply size (smaller than 0.1 \u03bcm) regardless of composition. Studies are inconsistent in attributing the health effects, whether to gaseous co-pollutants, particles themselves, trace elements, or toxic substances such as benzene and manganese (Samet and Krewski, 2007).\nRecent studies estimated a 0.21 percent increase in deaths per day per 10 \u03bcg m\u22123 increase in PM10 exposure, and an increase of approximately 4-8 percent in long-term risk of death for each 10 \u03bcg m\u22123 rise in annual PM2.5 concentrations (Kaiser, 2005; Krewski et al., 2009). Comparing data on life expectancy, socioeconomic status, and demographic characteristics for 51 U.S. metropolitan areas with data on PM2.5 concentrations for the late 1970s to early 1980s with the late 1990s to early 2000s, Pope III et al. (2009) concluded that a decrease of 10 \u03bcg m\u22123 in the concentration of PM2.5 was associated with an estimated increase in mean life expectancy of 0.61 \u00b1 0.20 year. A similar analysis in Europe, using a concentration-response function of an increase in risk of all-cause mortality by 6 percent per 10 \u03bcg m\u22123 of PM2.5, found that current exposure to PM from anthropogenic sources leads to an average loss of 8.6 months of life expectancy (WHO, 2006). The total number of premature deaths attributed to PM exposure was about 348,000 in 25 countries. Effects other than mortality, including some 100,000 annual hospital admissions, were also attributed to exposure. The study further concluded that PM from long-range transport\n\nOCR for page 73\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nFIGURE 3.3 Summary of relative risks for mortality by different air pollutants, related to a 10 \u03bcg\/m3 increase in pollution including 95 percent confidence intervals. PM10 includes PM2.5. A relative risk of 1.005 indicates a 0.5 percent increased risk of mortality.\nSOURCE: WHO (2004).\n\nOCR for page 74\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nof pollutants contributes significantly to these effects. Recently Corbett et al. (2007) estimated that shipping-related PM emissions contribute ~ 60,000 excess deaths annually worldwide, primarily in coastal regions, which face greater exposure to emissions from port areas, and generally have higher population density (see Chapter 6).\nEcosystem Impacts Wet and dry deposition of particulate-phase sulfate and nitrate species constitute major contributions to the atmospheric inputs of sulfur, nitrogen, and acidity to ecosystems. Particles can also serve as vehicles for the atmospheric transport and ultimately deposition of other pollutants, such as heavy metals and POPs. The interactions of atmospheric aerosols with solar radiation can affect rates of photosynthesis in complex ways (Cohan et al., 2002).\nVisibility and Radiative Forcing Impacts Submicron particulate matter is especially efficient at extinction of visible and ultraviolet radiation and represent the major contribution to visibility reduction in both rural and urban settings. This same mechanism is the basis for PM direct radiative forcing effects, that is, their impact on global radiation budget. The impacts of PM on radiative forcing, and the response of that forcing to future changes in PM emissions and lifetimes, are fundamentally different from those of greenhouse gases (GHG). First, while most GHGs are long-lived, PM has a short lifetime, so its influence on radiative budgets is more variable in space and time. Second, the direct radiative impacts of PM can be either warming or cooling, depending on the optical properties.\nGlobal average impacts The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Forster et al., 2007a) produces regular assessments of radiative forcing (RF) and climatic impact. Aerosols generally have a net negative climate forcing because they reflect sunlight away from Earth. Exceptions with positive RF are strongly absorbing aerosols such as black carbon, or aerosols with even a small amount of absorption that are located above clouds. Because the sign of forcing (positive or negative) varies with different types of aerosol particles, mitigation (or increased emissions) of these different aerosols will have very different impacts on climate.\nIPCC (2007) most recently estimated the direct RF of all anthropogenic aerosols as \u2212 0.5 W\/m2. Compared with greenhouse gas forcings of + 2.6 W\/m2, this value is smaller but not insignificant. If recent findings regarding the ubiquity of organic aerosol (Heald et al., 2005) were linked with rapid secondary organic aerosol formation from anthropogenic sources (e.g. Robinson et al., 2007), the RF estimates would become slightly more negative. Several indirect links between PMs and climate have been postulated, because particles serve as sites for the formation of\n\nOCR for page 75\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nliquid and ice-cloud particles. These include PM-induced modifications to cloud frequency, altitude, lifetime, microphysical and radiative properties, and effects on precipitation. Pollution aerosols are estimated to modify clouds to have smaller, more reflective droplets, with an additional negative forcing estimated at about \u22120.7 W\/m2 (IPCC, 2007) with a ~ 50 percent uncertainty.\nRegional impacts Global average forcing is only a partial measure of aerosol-climate interactions. Aerosol RF near source regions can be greater than global average RF by an order of magnitude, and RF reflects changes at the top of the atmosphere, ignoring redistribution of energy within the atmosphere (Satheesh and Ramanathan, 2000). Regional impacts of aerosols may include shifts in rainfall distribution (Rotstayn and Lohmann, 2002; Wang, 2007) or energy available to drive the hydrologic cycle (Meehl et al., 2008). Thus, the net aerosol impact on climate is not neatly represented by radiative forcing (NRC, 2005).\nClimatic impacts of transported PM The source-receptor approach described by HTAP-TF (2007) might also be used to indicate the impact of emissions in one region on RF, optical depth, or column burden in another region. Aerosol optical depths above downwind continents can be ~ 10-20 percent of those in source regions (Koch et al., 2007). Model calculations of Reddy and Boucher (2007) predicted that 20-30 percent of the black carbon column loading in East Asia, North America, and Europe was imported from other regions. RF by aerosol and gaseous emissions from isolated regions and sectors can be of the order of 100-400 mW\/m2 (Shindell et al., 2008a). These perturbations are small but not insignificant; radiative impacts of one region on another region are of the same magnitude as global average aerosol forcing.\nDespite the fact that aerosol PM concentrations vary regionally, recent studies on the impact of aerosol distributions on climate suggest that this response should be considered in a global context. Levy et al. (2008) and Kirkev\u00e5g et al. (2008) have found that climate simulations using aerosol loadings projected to the year 2100 using the SRES A2 scenario produce regional patterns of surface temperature warming that do not follow the regional patterns of changes in aerosol emissions, tropospheric loadings, or radiative forcing. Rather, the regional patterns of warming from aerosols are more similar to the patterns for well-mixed greenhouse gases.\nSensitive regions For regions with no internal sources of pollution, intercontinental transport from industrialized regions represents the only anthropogenic impact. For example, transported aerosols and other pollutants contribute to haze in the Arctic (Law and Stohl, 2007), which has both\n\nOCR for page 76\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nwarming and cooling components (Quinn et al., 2008). Absorbing aerosols in the haze when deposited on snow may hasten the onset of spring melt (Flanner et al., 2007). The connection between transported pollution and impacts on sensitive regions is an area of active research. Transport from lower latitudes to the Arctic is particularly uncertain in comparison with other source-receptor relationships (Shindell et al., 2008b).\nTHE REGULATORY CONTEXT FOR CONTROL OF PM\nThe import of PM into the United States has the potential to affect the ability to achieve compliance with U.S. regulations, which are aimed at both limiting ambient levels of PM to protect human health and welfare and at controlling emissions from new and existing sources. At the present time welfare-based standards for pollutants apply only to visibility impairment and potential crop damage and not to direct or indirect radiative forcing impacts.\nSurface Concentrations: Primary Standards Current U.S. health-based (primary) NAAQS for ambient concentrations of particulate matter focus on dry, unspeciated PM mass concentrations and exist for both PM10 and PM2.5. The most recent revision of the U.S. particulate matter standard, promulgated in 2006, tightened the 24-hr fine particle (PM2.5) standard from 65 \u03bcg m\u22123 to 35 \u03bcg m\u22123 and retained the annual fine particle standard at 15 \u03bcg m\u22123. To be in compliance with the annual standard the 3-yr average of the weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentrations from single or multiple community-oriented monitors must not exceed 15 \u03bcg m\u22123, while to attain the 24-hr standard, the 3-yr average of the 98th percentile of 24-hr concentrations at each population-oriented monitor within an area must not exceed 35 \u03bcg m\u22123. The existing 24-hr PM10 standard of 150 \u03bcg m\u22123 was retained, but the annual PM10 standard was revoked due to the lack of clear evidence linking long-term exposure to PM10 with adverse health impacts. Figure 3.4 compares the 24-hr PM2.5 ambient standards for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the World Health Organization. U.S. standards are higher than WHO-recommended levels, and may undergo further downward revision as epidemiological data continue to be collected and analyzed; the relative role of non-U.S. sources will assume more importance as standards are tightened.\nWe note here that even relatively small fractional contributions of PM, as may occur from long-range transport of PM, can be significant in national control strategies. For example, the U.S. Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Act and Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) specify allowable incremental emissions for new U.S. sources. Figure 3.4 shows the proposed allowable 24-hr PM2.5 emissions increment (2 \u03bcg m\u22123) for\n\nOCR for page 77\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nFIGURE 3.4 Comparison of current 24-hr health-based PM2.5 standards for the indicated countries, and U.S. allowable 24-hr emissions increment for Class I areas under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration rule.\nnew sources impacting Class I areas under PSD; the annual mean allowable increment is 1 \u03bcg m\u20133. Under CAIR, EPA considers an upwind state to contribute significantly to a downwind nonattainment area if the state's maximum contribution to PM2.5 in the area is \u2265 0.2 \u03bcg m3.\nSurface Concentrations: Secondary Standards U.S. secondary standards are set to protect human welfare, including visibility. In contrast to the NAAQS approach, which requires all areas of the nation to demonstrate that ambient pollutant concentrations are below a specified standard, the regional haze rule (passed in 1999) addresses only national parks and wilderness areas. State and federal agencies are required to improve visibility in these areas toward \"natural background conditions\" by 2064. Background conditions are those unaffected by anthropogenic emissions, so these may include impacts from sources such as fires and dust, including PM that has undergone long-range transport. Rising anthropogenic PM emissions from other countries that impact U.S. PM concentrations could present significant roadblocks to the achievement of designated background visibility conditions (Park et al., 2006), a complication not clearly addressed in the existing U.S. regulatory framework.\nEmissions Standards Primary PM emissions from on-road and nonroad mobile sources have been specifically targeted for reductions in the United States. The EPA established progressively more stringent mobile-source PM emission standards beginning in the mid-1970s for on-road\n\nOCR for page 86\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nFIGURE 3.7 The contribution to surface PM2.5 and sulfate column amounts (expressed as a percentage) of North American emissions relative to domestic emissions in the receptor region (e.g., for EU = \u0394NA\/\u0394EU).\nand sulfate column amounts due to changes in domestic emissions (e.g., for EU = \u0394NA\/\u0394EU). NA contributions range from 1 to 3 percent for surface PM and 5 to 17 percent for column sulfate, with the contributions to EU>SA>EA. The increase in import sensitivity from surface concentrations to column loadings indicates the substantial role of aerosol transport above the planetary boundary layer in the long-range transport of PM. The column aerosol loadings play an important role in radiative forcing. The fact that the import sensitivity of total column aerosol load is significantly larger than that for the surface concentrations means that regional aerosol radiative forcing and climate change are more greatly affected by distant sources than are air quality goals.\nThe HTAP comparison results provide insights into how the uncertainties in the models impact the source-receptor relationships. The chemical, removal, and emission processes all affect the lifetime of the species in the atmosphere. The impact of one region on another depends on the transport pathways, their length, and the intensity of the removal processes that the PM experiences along its way. The model-to-model diversity of sulfate lifetimes in absolute terms for a given region is considerable (a factor of\n\nOCR for page 87\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nfour), and reflects differences in the process level model formulations. In general, models that predict longer lifetimes predict larger contributions from distant sources. In addition, emissions from North America and East Asia appear to be slightly more efficiently removed than those from Europe and South Asia. These results suggest the need to develop observational techniques to constrain the lifetime of PM in the atmosphere, which would provide a strong metric for evaluating and improving models.\nThe use of the PM source attribution information in the assessment of impacts is just beginning. For example, Liu et al. (2009) use tagging to identify intercontinental source-receptor relationships, and estimate that approximately 90,000 premature deaths (for adults age 30 and up) globally and 1,100 in North America are associated with exposure to nondust PM2.5 of foreign origin. It is worth noting that this number of premature mortalities in North America is comparable to the reduction in premature mortalities expected to result from tightening the U.S. 8-hr O3 standard from 84 ppbv to 75 ppbv.\nFUTURE PROJECTIONS OF FACTORS INFLUENCING PM SURFACE CONCENTRATIONS\nA 20 percent increase in emissions in Europe, East Asia, and South Asia is estimated to change the annual PM2.5 concentrations at the surface in North America by ~ 0.02 \u03bcg m\u22123 (HTAP-TF, 2007). This import contribution amounts to 2 percent of the proposed annual average PM2.5 PSD increment (1 \u03bcg m\u22123), and 50 percent of the proposed significant impact level, 0.04 \u03bcg m\u22123, in Class I areas. The significant impact level is the level of ambient impact that is considered to represent a significant contribution to nonattainment. Larger increments are allowed in other areas, thus implying the biggest relative impact from imported emissions in national parks and wilderness areas. However, the estimated ~ 0.02 \u03bcg m\u22123 represents 10 percent of the allowed interstate impact under CAIR. The emissions of major PM components and precursors (BC and SO2) are estimated to have increased in Asia by ~ 50 percent from 2000 to 2006 (Zhang et al., 2009a), over two times the 20 percent assumed in the modeling experiment. Regional and seasonal contributions can be much higher. Although the most significant impacts on U.S. air quality from long-range transport of PM are likely to be related to compliance with the regional haze rule, the impacts extend beyond Class I areas.\nAlthough changes in baseline PM concentrations currently appear insignificant in comparison with local contributions to NAAQS exceedances in urban areas, as standards tighten a rising baseline would represent an increasing percentage of the total that cannot be controlled by domestic regulations. Furthermore, imported PM may represent a disproportionately\n\nOCR for page 88\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nhigher fraction of specific aerosol components that may be targeted in future regulations. Thus, shifting future priorities may enhance the relative importance of non-U.S. contributions to PM. It should also be noted that changes in emissions from foreign sources may change the magnitude of extreme events, in addition to the baseline changes mentioned above.\nIn Table 3.1 we provide rough estimates of future emission changes based on the knowledge available today. The remainder of this section describes the sources of the values in the table. Large uncertainties in these estimates can be expected, due to imperfect understanding about the trajectories of economy and technology, and about the responses of forests and deserts. The values here are provided only to evaluate whether future changes in intercontinental transport could be expected to significantly affect PM budgets in the United States. Most models that examine changes in future emissions due to anthropogenic global change compare present-day conditions with a doubled-CO2 climate (expected to occur ~ 2050) or with conditions in 2100. This study is focusing on a shorter time horizon, roughly to 2030; to approximate the response in 2030 we use half the change projected for 2050 (doubled CO2), or one-quarter of the change projected for 2100 (recognizing that this approach may miss some nonlinearities in the actual response). We rely on model results summarized by the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC, 2007) when possible.\nTABLE 3.1 Possible Future Changes in Emissions of PM (see text for explanation of how numbers were derived).\nSource Region\nReceptor Region\nPercent Change by 2030\nEnergy and Economy (Change in Baseline)\n*\nEast Asia\nWestern U.S.\n\u2212 40 to + 50\n*\nMexico and Central America\nSE U.S.\n\u2212 80 to \u2212 50\n\u2020\nNortheast U.S.\nCanada, Mexico, Europe, Arctic\n\u2212 80 to \u2212 40\n*\nShipping\nCoastal U.S.\n\u2212 40 to + 55\nDust (Change in Baseline and Episodes)\n*\nEast Asia\nWestern U.S.\n*\nNorth Africa\nSE and NE U.S.\n\u2212 15 to + 95\nOpen Fire (Change in Episodes)\n*\nMexico and Central America\nSE and SW U.S.\n*\nWestern Canada\nMidwestern U.S.\n+10 to +30\n\u2020\nNortheast U.S.\nArctic\n* Import to United States.\n\u2020 Export from United States.\n\nOCR for page 89\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nEnergy and Economy We use the sum of the increases in sulfur dioxide, black carbon, nitrate, and organic carbon emissions to estimate PM increases for 2030. Our range of estimates is based on the maximum feasible reduction and current legislation scenarios produced by IIASA (Cofala et al., 2007). These changes are \u221245 to +50 percent for East Asia, \u221280 to \u221250 percent for Central America, and \u221260 to \u221280 percent for the United States. A wider range of economic and technological scenarios has been explored for shipping emissions (Eyring et al., 2005), and that range is also given in the table. The contribution of secondary organic particulate matter is not included in this analysis, but estimates of future increases are less than 10 percent by 2030, based on 2100 estimates (Heald et al., 2008).\nDust Desert dust is mobilized by wind from exposed surfaces. Dust emissions are affected by the nature of the land surface, which changes due to human activity and vegetation (McConnell et al., 2007; Neff et al., 2008), and by surface windspeed (Tegen, 2003; Engelstaedter and Washington, 2007). These governing factors result in significant annual variability (Prospero and Lamb, 2003; Qian et al., 2004) and sensitivity to climate, including emission damping by increased vegetation in a higher-CO2 world (Mahowald and Luo, 2003). IPCC (2007, Section 7.5.1.1) provides a range of changes by 2100, from \u221260 to 380 percent, and we use one-quarter of this value.\nOpen Fires Open fires occur because of deforestation, natural causes such as lightning strikes, prescribed fires for land management, and seasonal fires for agricultural land clearing. In our estimates of future changes we neglect two of these: deforestation, which is a minor factor in most source regions, and prescribed fires, which depend on management policies. A warmer climate is expected to increase fire frequency and quantity (IPCC, 2007, Section 7.3.3.1; Spracklen et al., 2007). This change is attributable to droughts and to other changes in climate regimes for both tropical areas and boreal forests. We infer, from estimates of changes in Canadian fires by 2100 (Flannigan et al., 2005; Girardin and Mudelsee, 2008), that an increase of 10-30 percent could be expected by 2030. However, many of these estimates do not account for all feedbacks, such as changes in vegetation or ignition frequency. Further, the burned area of Canadian forest fires has already doubled between the 1970s and 1990s (Kasischke and Turetsky, 2006). Thus, the value in Table 3.1 could be an underestimate.\nTransport Pollutants arriving in either the United States or regions affected by the United States, may be altered due to future synoptic-scale dynamics, convection and transport at high altitudes, or climate modes such as El Ni\u00f1o or the North Atlantic Oscillation (HTAP-TF, 2007). If the\n\nOCR for page 90\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\naverage climate changes, we may also expect differences in reaction rates, such as those leading to secondary organic particulate matter, and removal rates, such as rainout. While specific studies focused on the impact of climate change on the long-range transport of pollutants are just beginning, a number of robust changes in transport patterns under climate change scenarios have emerged from model, theoretical, and observational studies (HTAP-TF, 2007). These studies suggest less frequent large-scale venting of the boundary layer, which implies less export of pollution from the boundary layer. However, once exported from a source region, the extent of long-range transport depends upon the lifetime of the pollutant. For the case of particulate matter the lifetimes are heavily dependent on the wet removal processes (i.e., the lifetimes decrease as wet removal rates increase). Changes in cloud properties and precipitation patterns and quantity resulting from climate change will affect the transport distances of PM. Thus, if PM lifetimes are decreased, export from source regions may remain unchanged or even decrease despite increasing future emissions. We also know that pollution export is dependent upon location (HTAP-TF, 2007), with export from Southeast Asia being more efficient than from North America and export from Europe least efficient. This is due to the amount of convective activity over oceans (Stohl et al., 2002). Future emission increases are projected to be shifted toward the tropics (IPCC, 2007), and the efficiency of export from those regions experiencing increases need to be considered in order to evaluate their impact on long-range transport.\nKEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nQuestion: What do we know about the current import and export of PM?\nFinding. Satellite, aircraft, and ground-based observations demonstrate that PM can undergo long-range transport. Episodic events associated with biomass burning plumes, dust storms, and fast transport of industrial pollution are most easily identifiable in observations from rural areas and high altitudes, where they represent large excursions above typical ambient concentrations. Some excursions in PM concentrations clearly attributable to long-range transport episodes have been recorded at the surface in urban areas, but in general, the contributions from long-range transport in such regions are difficult to isolate from PM of U.S. origin.\nFinding. It remains difficult to quantify from observations alone the frequencies and magnitudes of contributions from persistent long-range transport of PM. Such transport occurs routinely, but\n\nOCR for page 91\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\npresumably brings much lower concentrations of PM than do episodic events, making it difficult to quantitatively distinguish the long-range transport signal from that due to local and regional PM sources.\nFinding. Ensemble studies of chemical transport models estimate that PM sources in Europe, South Asia, and East Asia contribute on average 0.05\u20130.15 \u03bcg m\u22123 to the continental U.S. annual mean surface PM2.5 concentration (obtained by scaling the 20 percent perturbation results by a factor of 5 to account for 100 percent of the foreign influence, ignoring any nonlinear effects). Larger contributions can occur for particular seasons and geographical regions.\nFinding. Chemical transport models can be used to estimate long-range transport contributions to atmospheric PM concentrations, as well as the contributions to deposition of sulfate, nitrate, metals, Hg, and POPs. However, large uncertainties in model estimates result from several factors, including lack of observational constraints, particularly in the free troposphere where much of the transport occurs; poorly constrained or unknown emissions of some primary particles and the emissions and conversion of PM precursors (especially for secondary organic PM); and poorly constrained wet and dry PM removal processes, as reflected in the large differences in PM lifetimes among models.\nFinding. There are growing capabilities for observing total column amounts of PM from ground-based and satellite observations, and this information is being used to detect global and regional column trends. Yet the linkages between column PM amounts and surface PM levels are complicated and not well understood; for example, there is little information about how PM aloft is mixed down to the surface. This limits our ability to quantify the effect of persistent transport on surface concentrations based on column observations. There is, however, ongoing work to improve our ability to model these relationships between column and surface PM.\nFinding. There is not enough observational evidence to demonstrate clear trends in average baseline levels of surface PM on a global or hemispheric scale. Because of the relatively short lifetime of PM, observations must be gathered over long time periods (around a decade at least) before trends can be distinguished from short-term variability.\n\nOCR for page 92\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nRecommendations. Improve our ability to characterize the import and export of PM by implementing\ncontinuous aerosol observatories in key locations, to be defined as part of a comprehensive measurement strategy, including strategically located marine- and mountaintop-based sites. Key observational variables include those that can help with identifying source fingerprints (e.g., speciated and size-resolved aerosols) to permit quantification of the associated PM fractions with high time resolution. A minimum requirement is one sample per 24 hours, but shorter time resolution will yield even greater capability to distinguish between local and long-range transport. Long-term observations are needed to encompass the statistical variability of natural processes, as well as to separate trends in emissions from variability in transport and removal.\nlong-term, time-resolved data collection, both inside and outside urban areas, combined with meteorological modeling of horizontal and vertical transport. Such data are needed to elucidate the impact of long-range transport in regions that are near air quality standard compliance limits, where the contribution of long-range transport is generally most difficult to detect.\nimprovement and application of methods for quantifying import and export of PM using space-based observations. A particular focus should be on observations and methods that can be used to constrain vertical distributions (e.g., space-based and ground-based lidars) and those that can elucidate the relationships between column amounts of PM and surface PM concentrations.\nadvancements in modeling capabilities that include merging bottom-up with top-down emission estimates; validating combined emission and model systems with in situ and remotely sensed observations; constraining PM column amounts, including speciated PM when possible; and refining and applying fingerprinting techniques in observations to aid in verification of modeled source attributions. Modeling improvements that are particularly important in evaluation of long-range transport are the simulation of dust emissions, fire emissions, and production of secondary organic PM.\nQuestion: What are potential implications of long-range PM transport for meeting environmental goals?\nFinding. With the exception of occasional extreme episodes, most often attributable to dust and wildfires, long-range transport of PM\n\nOCR for page 93\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nis estimated to represent a negligible contribution to PM NAAQS exceedances in most regions in the United States.\nFinding. Increases in surface PM from episodic or persistent transport are significant relative to other sources in places such as the Arctic and portions of the western United States, which do not have large local pollution sources. In particular, strategies to achieve compliance with the regional haze rule across the United States may be complicated by imported PM because existing U.S. regulations prohibit increments in annual mean PM2.5 concentrations above 1 \u03bcg m\u22123 in Class I areas, and even tighter limits on incremental contributions may be imposed in future regulations.\nFinding. Some initial studies have begun to estimate the premature mortalities attributable to long-range transport of PM, but they are very preliminary at this time due to the large uncertainties in estimates of imported and exported PM. These estimates are not only limited by uncertainties in quantitative estimates of the imported fraction of PM but also by lack of a mechanistic understanding of how the individual components of PM are linked to health. Current estimates indicate that domestic sources of PM are by far the larger risk to human health. Any import of PM from distant sources could add to the health burden, because there is thought to be no threshold for PM health impacts (and impacts rise linearly with increasing concentration).\nFinding. Both longer-term sustained and episodic increases in column PM across the United States attributable to long-range transport may represent potentially significant perturbations to the regional radiative balance.\nFinding. The ecological and agricultural impacts of long-range transport of PM have not been evaluated.\nRecommendation. Improve abilities to estimate the potential implications of non-U.S. PM sources for the attainment of U.S. environmental goals by:\nimproving quantification of imported and exported PM fractions, which in turn requires coordinated modeling and observational strategies (see next question);\ndeveloping the capability to quantify the trends in PM surface concentrations and to attribute these trends to emissions from\n\nOCR for page 94\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nspecific sources. Because baseline PM concentrations are so low and variable, questions regarding trends in this baseline can be answered only through a long-term strategy that integrates observations and models. Baseline and background changes tend to be regional (e.g., Northern Hemisphere; Arctic, Pacific, and Atlantic regions), thus requiring corresponding regional strategies;\nreevaluating the health burden resulting from imported PM, as better mechanistic understanding of PM-health links becomes available;\nassessing the other impacts of imported PM, such as adverse consequences for ecological and agricultural systems, and consequences for regional and global radiative forcing.\nQuestion: How might factors influencing the relative importance of U.S. and foreign contributions to PM change in the future?\nFinding. A warming climate is expected to lead to shifts in emissions of PM associated with the natural environment and changes in the meteorology that affects pollution dispersion. Hypothesized impacts include:\nincreasing annual numbers of forest fires, which in turn would increase the frequency of extreme PM concentration events from long-range transport of fire emissions;\nchanges in dust particle sources (although even the sign of increase or decrease is currently uncertain);\nchanges (often reductions) in the rate at which surface and boundary layer air is vented to the upper atmosphere;\ncomplex changes in cloud amount and lifetime and precipitation patterns, in turn affecting PM removal rates and spatial patterns of deposition;\nchanges in PM precursor emissions, particularly biogenic gases emitted from vegetation.\nThese changes would all have implications for how much PM (and precursors) is emitted from various source regions, how much of the emitted PM escapes from source areas, and the fraction of PM that survives transport to affect areas downwind. At present, it is not possible to predict the net impacts.\nFinding. In the short term (e.g., next 10\u201320 years), emissions from developing countries will likely continue to increase. In the longer term it is not possible to predict how future emissions will change\n\nOCR for page 95\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nand how these will in turn affect long-range transport of PM. As global economic and industrial activities expand, greater emissions of PM and precursor species might be expected, with projected growth varying widely, depending on economic scenario assumptions. The result could be a higher baseline of imported PM; however, introduction of standards, and cleaner technologies to address national standards moving toward WHO guidelines, may slow or reverse this trend.\nFinding. A better understanding of the health effects of PM may lead to different or more stringent standards in the United States and elsewhere. For example, revised regulations may not focus solely on mandating lower acceptable concentrations of PM2.5 but may also (or instead) focus on particular fractions or characteristics of PM, such as number concentration, the presence of toxic metals, or the particles' oxidative state. Identification of the PM characteristics responsible for health outcomes will also allow monitoring, modeling, and apportionment activities to be tailored toward those characteristics, which will in turn help advance our understanding of the true significance of long-range transport of PM.\nRecommendation. Increase our ability to forecast the future significance of imported PM by:\nincreasing understanding of how future climate will affect patterns of dust mobilization, fire frequency and intensity, and biogenic emissions;\nunderstanding how regional perturbations in aerosols affect climate;\ndeveloping multipollutant emission inventories with high spatial resolution that reflect economic growth, technological change, and incoming regulations;\nimproving the forecasting of changes in atmospheric dynamics that affect transport of pollution plumes, particularly boundary layer venting and precipitation, under changing climates;\ndesigning effective observational networks that enable rigorous analysis of PM composition, trends, and other factors that relate to long-range transport.\nAdditional information will be needed to pinpoint the PM characteristics and monitoring strategies that are most useful for understanding impacts on human health.\n\nOCR for page 96\nGlobal Sources of Local Pollution: An Assessment of Long-Range Transport of Key Air Pollutants to and from the United States\nThis page intentionally left blank."}

{"text":"View This Map\n\nExplore Further\n\nForestry\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the number of paper and wood chip mills in Tennessee grew dramatically. With no legislation regulating the clearing of forested land, some parts of Tennessee experienced widespread clear-cutting of old forests. Over the years, local environmental groups have fought for an overarching law that would insist on responsible forestry practices. While no such law has been passed, some stop-gap measures have been put in place.\n\nStrip Mining\n\nStrip mines have a devastating environmental impact. In a strip mine, the surface of the earth above a seam of coal is removed, leaving scarred and bare earth. The most devastating type of strip mining is mountaintop removal, when the whole mountain is destroyed by explosives to get to the coal, which can lie as many as 800 feet below the surface.\n\nMountaintop removal and other types of strip mining have terrible consequences for drinking-water quality, animal and plant life, and the native culture of places that are affected. Dumping of debris from the removal process buries streams and fills valleys. When the coal companies are done, they pile dirt back up on the exposed mountains and drop exotic grass seed from above. In this way, they say, the mountain is restored. But while they may be able to approximate the shape of the old mountain, they cannot re-create the intricate web of life that once existed there.\n\nStrip mining is most common in parts of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky, but it takes place in Tennessee, too. Mining operations exist in Scott, Campbell, and Claiborne Counties in the northern Cumberland Plateau region. Residents and environmental activists fought to prevent mountaintop removal at Zeb Mountain in Scott and Campbell Counties, but were unsuccessful.\n\nIn 2004, the last year for which statistics are available, Tennessee had 43 coal mines and produced 2.8 million short tons of coal.\n\nAir Pollution\n\nCar emissions, industrial pollution, and other activities cause air pollution. In Tennessee, exhaust from cars and trucks, plus the toxic emissions from coal-fired generating plants, are the biggest contributors to air pollution.\n\nThe American Lung Association has ranked each of the state's four main cities, Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, as among the nation's 30 most polluted cities.\n\nAs a result, Clean Air Tennessee, a state-sponsored agency, monitors air quality in seven locations in the state: Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, the Tri-Cities, Clarksville, Chattanooga, and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. You can check air-quality forecasts and historical air-quality data on their website,  On this website you can sign up to receive alerts when air-quality levels reach dangerous levels in your area.\n\nThe air quality in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a serious concern for scientists. According to the park, the average visibility is 25 miles, compared to the national average of 93 miles. Some days, haze causes visibility to diminish to less than one mile. Some days, the level of ground-level ozone exceeds what is recommended for human exposure.\n\nAir quality is usually worst during the hot summer months of July and August.\n\nLand Use\n\nAccording to the Tennessee Environmental Council, the state has the seventh-highest rate of development in the United States. Some 80,000 acres of rural land are developed in Tennessee each year. The areas around Nashville and Knoxville have seen the greatest sprawl.\n\nUrban and suburban sprawl leads to long driving times, increased air pollution, strain on scarce water resources, and the elimination of farmland, rural landscapes, and natural habitats. Smart growth policies, zoning issues, and better transportation solutions are some of the biggest challenges facing Tennessee at the moment.\n\nWater Pollution\n\nThe cleanliness of Tennessee's rivers, lakes, and streams is monitored according to the standards of the Clean Water Act. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation monitors the health of the state's rivers, and publishes an annual list that divides bodies of water into categories one through five, where category one is the cleanest and five the dirtiest. In its last report, the agency reported that some 25 percent of the state's river miles were category one and 31 percent were in the dirtiest category. As for lakes and reservoirs, 21 percent of lake acres were classified as \"impaired.\"\n\nMost water pollution is caused by sedimentation and silt run-off from construction and agriculture. Habitat alternation, pathogens found in wastewater, and nutrients from fertilizers are also problems. Some pollution can be readily cleaned up, but so-called \"legacy pollutants,\" such as PCBs and chlordane from old industrial sites, can remain present for years and can poison fish and other marine animals.\n\nAccording to the state government, some 41 percent of pollution in streams and rivers in 2006 came from agriculture; 19 percent from hydrologic modification; and 18 percent from municipal sources. For lakes, some 72 percent of contaminants were legacy pollutants.\n\nThe state is supposed to post a warning when a river or stream is deemed too polluted for fishing, swimming, or other forms of use.

{"text":"Air Pollution Has Negative Effects on Heart Health\n\n(NaturalNews) It would be natural to think that microscopic particles in polluted air would do damage to one's lungs, nose and throat. However, recent research published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association has reported that such particles can in fact negatively affect the ability of the heart in people with serious coronary artery disease to conduct electrical signals.\n\nDetails of Study\n\nThe study looked at 48 coronary artery disease patients who lived in the Boston area, all of whom had previously experienced hospital procedures to open up or examine their coronary arteries.\n\nThe group of them had been hospitalized because of deteriorating symptoms of stable coronary artery disease, unstable angina, or a heart attack. Their median age was 57 years and more than 80% were men. In addition, 1 out of 4 had diabetes, while 2 out of every 5 had had a heart attack.\n\nThe study team followed up with the patients about two to four weeks post-discharge, and then another three more times at interval periods of about 3-months.\n\nHolter monitors, which are portable electrocardiographs, were used to record the participants' heart activity and to help obtain indications of events such as lack of blood flow to the heart or a heart muscle which was inflamed. Should such situations present themselves, a conductivity change, called an \"ST-segment depression\", would show up on electrocardiograms.\n\nThese measurements were then compared with the levels of certain pollutants, including particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers (or 1\/10,000th of an inch), also called PM2.5, and black carbon, which is produced during the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.\n\nFor all the pollutants which were included in the analysis, mean 24-hour levels were within the National Air Quality Standard limits. This meant that air quality was generally considered healthy.\n\nFindings of Study\n\n\"We found that an elevation in fine particles, from non-traffic as well as traffic sources, and black carbon, a marker for traffic, predicted ST-segment depression,\" said Diane R. Gold, M.D., M.P.H., senior author of the study, which involved researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the Harvard Medical School in Boston, Mass.\n\n\"Effects were greatest within the first month after hospitalization, and for patients who were hospitalized for a heart attack or had diabetes,\" added Gold.\n\nAnother pollutant associated with ST-segment depression was sulfur dioxide, which can also originate from non-traffic sources. There was no significant correlation obtained between ST-segment depression and the levels of carbon monoxide, although it should be noted that levels of the latter were generally low for this study.\n\nBroadly speaking, these findings are consistent with previous studies, which have shown the link between increased particulate air pollution and risk of heart attack or cardiac death, as well as exposure to road traffic triggering off heart attacks. For example, in a study published in 2002, it was reported that cardiovascular deaths decreased by 10 percent in Dublin, Ireland, after coal sales were banned and concentrations of black smoke in the air dropped by 70 percent within the next 3 years.\n\nWhile the ST-segment changes which the study team observed were not associated with actual physical symptoms in the subjects, nevertheless, their findings provide further evidence that unclean air can affect heart health, either through reduction of blood flow or heart muscle inflammation.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWhile the question remains as to how air pollution causes ST-segment depression \u2013 Gold said that \"further research is needed to evaluate whether the pollution-related ST-segment depression that we see is related to increased heart muscle inflammation, reduced oxygen flow, oxidative stress, or increased risk of arrhythmias\" \u2013 enough is probably known for now for those at risk to take some action.\n\n\"We think that our findings, which are definitely subclinical, may represent a process that increases clinical risk for people with symptomatic coronary artery disease,\" Gold said. The research team also said that their findings suggest that physicians and heart patients be extra careful in the weeks immediately after discharge from hospital.\n\nIf you or a loved one has heart problems, then you may want to take note.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends that some heart patients, especially those who have had a heart attack, do not drive for two to weeks after being discharged and also avoid driving in heavy traffic because of the stress such a situation creates.\n\n\"Our study provides additional rationale to avoid or reduce heavy traffic exposure after discharge, even for those without a heart attack, since traffic exposure involves pollution exposure as well as stress,\" said Gold.\n\nCertain additional precautionary steps may also be useful, such as making sure one is not exposed to other forms of air pollution, for example construction sites, and the use of air purifiers to improve the quality of air in the home"}
{"text":"The World Health Organization recently recognized environmental noise as harmful pollution, with adverse psychosocial and physiological effects on public health. A new study of noise pollution in Fulton County, Georgia, suggests that many residents are exposed to high noise levels that put them at risk of annoyance or sleep disturbance, which can have serious health consequences. The research is published in the October issue of American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\n\"Our research estimated that the percentage of the overall populations at risk of high annoyance is 9.5%, and highly disturbed sleep at 2.3%,\" says co-investigator James B. Holt, PhD, of the Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch, Division of Population Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA. \"Long-term exposure to noise could increase the risks of heart attack and high blood pressure. Nighttime noise can reduce sleep quality and increase morning tiredness and insomnia.\"\n\nFulton County, Georgia is a highly urbanized area incorporating the city of Atlanta and surrounding communities. Interstate Highway 285 runs around the heart of the county, and the area inside 285 has a complex high-density road network. Investigators collected a number of data sets to estimate road traffic noise exposure levels, including topographical information, vehicle volume and speed, and the mix of vehicle types. The US Federal Highway Administration's Traffic Noise Model was used to produce road traffic noise maps for daytime and nighttime. They calculated metrics to indicate the probability that certain percentages of the population, exposed to certain levels of road traffic noise, would be highly annoyed or have high levels of sleep disturbance, at a given point.\n\nThree cities - Atlanta, Sandy Springs, and Alpharetta --- contributed to 79% of the estimated total number of people who were highly annoyed by noise in Fulton County. Atlanta, Sandy Springs, and Roswell contributed to 78% of sleep disturbance. These cities also have the highest populations in the county. In terms of prevalence, the smaller city of College Park was the city most negatively impacted, with 11.3% of its daytime population and 3.7% of its nighttime population estimated to be at risk for experiencing annoyance or sleep disturbance. Most of the people affected appeared inside the I-285 corridor and contributed 68% and 64%, respectively, to the populations estimated to be at risk of experiencing high levels of annoyance and sleep disturbance.\n\nIn a US Census Bureau survey, the city of Atlanta had the lowest percentage of households among 38 metropolitan areas reporting the presence of road traffic noise. \"It may be assumed that even more people would be affected in other densely populated areas of the US,\" notes Dr. Holt.\n\nDr. Holt suggests that more studies are needed to gain insights into the severity of road traffic noise in US urban communities. \"We believe it is time to begin extensive traffic-related noise research and establish up-to-date policies to control and abate noise problems for our communities,\" he says. \"Adequate restful sleep and mental well-being are as essential to good health as adequate nutrition and physical activity. Assessing and alleviating environmental noise is an essential element for improving or creating healthy communities where adults and children can play, work, and live.\"\n\nSleep problems may increase risk for prostate cancer\n\nStudy: Insomnia takes toll on tinnitus patients ForSleep disturbances hurt memory consolidation Sleep disturbance negatively impacts the memory consolidation and enhancement that usually occurs with a good night's sleep, according to a study published Mar. 28 in the open access journal PLoS ONE.\n\nStudy: Sleep gets better with age, not worse Aging...\n\nSleep disturbance is extremely common in the various disorders of development, be they physical or psychological in nature.

{"text":"Related Stories & Links\n\nThe widely watched decision, which was expected to signal how the Obama administration will approach environmental issues in its second term, should curtail the amount of soot released from diesel exhaust, coal-fired power plants, refineries and other emitters by requiring costly pollution controls.\n\nThe minute particles of soot \u2013 smaller than the diameter of a strand of human hair \u2013 are considered particularly dangerous for children because they lodge deep in their lungs. Soot also is the primary cause of haze, and it's considered a short-lived climate pollutant that can contribute to global warming.\n\nExposure to soot costs tens of thousands of premature deaths annually, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said in announcing the new limits. The EPA estimates that the health benefits of the revised standard will range from $4 billion to more than $9 billion per year. The agency estimates that it will cost $53 million to $350 million to implement.\n\n\"Families from around the country will benefit from the simple fact of being able to breathe cleaner air,\" said Jackson, who noted that clean air isn't just an abstract concept to her. Her own two sons have battled asthma, she said.\n\nCurrently, 66 U.S. counties are out of compliance with the existing air-quality rules on soot. The agency projects that with the exception of seven counties in California that have persistent air-quality problems, most U.S. communities should be able to comply with the new limits by 2020.\n\nClean-air advocates say that lowering the limit will reduce thousands of premature deaths, heart attacks and cases of asthma. They applauded monitoring requirements near highways in urban areas, which will keep tabs on emissions to help determine the next round of air pollution standards. People who live along highways are at particular risk for exposure.\n\n\"By setting a more protective standard, the EPA is stating that we as a nation must protect the health of the public by cleaning up even more of this lethal pollutant,\" said Dr. Norman Edelman, the chief medical officer for the American Lung Association. \"Reducing particle pollution will prevent heart attacks and asthma attacks, and will keep children out of the emergency room and hospitals. It will save lives.\"\n\nSome industries, led by the American Petroleum Institute, fought unsuccessfully to delay implementation of the rules, saying they'd be expensive and would have \"doubtful benefit\" on health. Industry officials said they were especially concerned about the effect of the new limits when they were coupled with pending greenhouse-gas regulations for refineries and forthcoming rules on ozone.\n\n\"The collective impacts of all of these and other potential new regulations at a time when 12 million Americans are still unemployed would be a blow to our economy as it struggles to recover and put Americans back to work,\" said Howard Feldman, the director of regulatory and scientific affairs at the petroleum institute. \"These rules could significantly slow business development and job creation. It makes no sense to risk this when the necessity of many of these regulations is ambiguous at best.\"\n\nThe new soot standard was lowered from its 1997 level of 15 micrograms per cubic meter to 12 micrograms per cubic meter. The standards define how much soot pollution is unhealthy for humans to breathe, and they set clean air limits to ensure healthy air quality. The EPA made no changes to the 24-hour fine particle standard or the coarse particle standard \u2013 the daily averages of soot levels in the air over the course of a year \u2013 although the lung association and other groups pressed the agency to consider evidence that both standards need strengthening.\n\nThe EPA will identify counties in states that are likely to be out of compliance with the new rules. States then must develop their own rules to meet the new standards and curtail soot-producing emissions. They have several years to do so.\n\nThere's been a long history of regulatory foot-dragging on the issue. The new limits come only after Earthjustice, an environmental legal group, went to court on behalf of the American Lung Association and the National Parks Conservation Association to force the EPA to apply standards recommended by its own scientific advisory committee. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review air-quality standards every five years and update them as needed. The agency updated one national limit in 2006, but it didn't strengthen the standard for soot 2.5 micrometers in diameter or less.\n\nIn the week before the new rules were made public, clean air advocates and industry representatives gathered at the White House to hear details of the rules. The EPA had sought a lower limit and asked for public comment on setting it at 11 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nThe agency wrangled with the White House Office of Management and Budget, which sought a limit of 13 micrograms per cubic meter. Ultimately, the agency settled on 12.\n\nSimilar stories:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 At age 80, Seattle's Bill Ruckelshaus remembers those pro-environment days in the early 1970s, when his old Republican boss, then-President Richard Nixon, urged Americans to make peace with nature and his party joined Democrats to pass laws protecting the air and water."}

They were wrong\n\nAir pollution \u2013 seen by most of the population as an outdated public health issue \u2013 has returned to mainstream media attention in recent months. March saw a widely-reported publication from the Environmental Audit Committee, which said the UK should be 'ashamed' of its poor air quality.\n\nThere has been debate in the House of Lords, and threats from the European Commission of multi-million euro penalties for half-hearted British efforts which have failed to meet mandatory air quality targets set five years ago. The BBC and other outlets have also investigated fears that the London Olympics will be jeopardised by a blanket of pollutants spewed from congested traffic.\n\nMeanwhile, activists have employed new media technologies to increase air pollution's...\n\nTo view the rest of this article - you must be a paying subscriber and Login"}
{"text":"Regional News\n\n(NC)\u2014As summer fades away and we spend more time inside, it's important to take notice of the air around us. Thanks to allergens, air conditioners, heaters and the smelly souvenirs left behind by household pets, chefs and athletes, indoor air isn't always the healthiest. Those of us with asthma\u2014more than three million Canadians\u2014or allergies, know all too well how the changing seasons can affect our ability to breathe.\n\nEffectively improving the air quality in your home or office doesn't have to be a chore. Follow the tips below to ensure the air in your home is cleaner, better smelling, and healthier for you and your family.\n\n\u2022 Invest in one of today's advanced air purifiers you can take with you from room to room. You can move it to help those with seasonal allergies, combat cooking smells in the kitchen or place in the bedroom of your little one suffering from a cold.\n\n\u2022 With indoor season approaching, consider investing in a humidifier for your home. Humidifiers restore moisture to your indoor air and make living more comfortable during the winter months. For a two-in-one punch, choose an air purifier that also includes a humidifying function. It'll take up less space and be more cost efficient overall.\n\n\u2022 Avoid installing carpeting throughout your home if you have allergy or asthma sufferers in residence. Carpets attract the dust and allergens that can aggravate these conditions. If you do have carpet, remember to vacuum frequently to avoid dust build-up.\n\n\u2022 Don't forget your car! Research has shown our cars can be a minefield of bacteria and dirt. And let's face it, we spend a significant amount of time in that closed-in space. You can keep bacteria levels lower with regular cleaning and by using one of today's small, but mighty air purifiers that fit into your car's cup holder.\n\nWith these tips, you and your family can rest and breathe easy in the winter months, knowing your home has the best air possible. And while it never hurts to get outside in the winter weather and get fresh air into your lungs, it always helps to know your warm, healthy home is waiting"}
{"text":"Tools\n\nEach night from the 9th to 28th October a major new artwork by the Dryden Goodwin will be exhibited as part of 'Invisible Breath' a series of commissions by the arts group Invisible Dust.\n\nThe artwork will take the form of a large scale outdoor projection on St Thomas' Hospital showing an animation of a sketched young boy breathing.\n\nKing's Professor Frank Kelly is an advisor to the 'Breathe' project and King's and Invisible Dust have worked closely on the EXHALE project over the last 4 years mixing art and science as part of our schools education work and to further the public understanding of air pollution issues.\n\nInvisible Dust curator Alice Sharp describes the piece:\n\n\"The act of breath embodies the transcoding of air - from the ethereal to solid, the invisible to the concrete, the fluid to the dense. Breath, animated by the vibrations of billions of airborne molecules, floating particles and fibers of the human body, is an elemental poetry: it is one of the most beautiful encounters between living bodies and the living world.\n\nDryden Goodwin's Breathe is an evocation of this poetry. He has created over a thousand drawings of a five year old boy (his son) inhaling and exhaling air. But their most startling quality is their ability to evoke the materiality - the heaviness - of the invisible. In Goodwin's works, air is not unremarkable, transient or still. Rather, air is an object that permeates the human figure, carrying with it the incredibly diverse and even harmful residues of the city of London.\"\n\nBreathe will be launched Tonight October 8th at St Thomas' Hospital 6:30pm - 8:30pm and Air Mail readers are invited to the launch, please email bianca@invisibledust.com with 'Houses RSVP' for your reservation.\n\nOn October 16th, Dryden Goodwin will be hosted by the Environmental Audit Committee to discuss his work. Professor Frank Kelly will also be discussing the impact of air pollution on children's health, the discussion will be chaired by the committee chair Joan Walley MP."}
{"text":"A healthy home is well ventilated;\nfree of pests, toxics, and dangerous gases; dry;\nclean; comfortable; and\naffordable. Good construction and maintenance practices can\nachieve these conditions, even in an older home.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the dust in our homes is tracked in from outdoors,\nmaking a dust-free home a practical impossibility. However, we can reduce\nthe amount of dust we bring in from outside by designing entryway systems\nto help remove dust from our shoes before we bring it inside. Filters\nfor heating, ventilation,\nand air cooling (HVAC) systems are also effective in reducing dust particles\nin the home. Reducing excessive moisture and relative humidity can also\nmake a home less inviting for dust mites. In all cases, it is helpful\nto build homes with smooth and cleanable materials that make it easier\nto remove dust and dust mites through cleaning. Clutter contributes to\nincreased levels of dust by creating surfaces for dust to gather. Keeping\nfloor and countertop areas clear, particularly near vents, will prevent\ndust from building up. While insufficient housekeeping can be a factor\nin dust build-up, an overcrowded setting also plays a role.\n\nWell ventilatedhomes have systems to remove contaminants and allergens that can\ncause respiratory problems such as dust and byproducts from heating and\ncooking. These mechanisms\ninclude fans that exhaust to the outside and changes in air pressure to\nensure the movement of air from the outside to the inside.\n\nCombustion product-safe homes minimize\ncarbon monoxide,\nwhich can cause death and more subtle health effects (fatigue, headaches,\nnausea). Products that can create carbon monoxide include cars in an attached\ngarage (when the engine is warming up), gas stoves, gas water heaters,\ngas furnaces with a cracked heat exchanger or a leaking chimney, non-electric\nspace heaters, and gas fireplaces.\nPest-freehomes reduce the presence\nof pests such as cockroaches. Cockroaches shed feces and skins that can\ntrigger allergic reactions often associated with asthma and other respiratory\nproblems. Adverse health conditions can also arise when homeowners reacting\nto a pest problem apply harmful pesticides\nin their homes.\n\nToxic chemical-free homes reduce and eliminate\ntoxins, such as asbestos,\nlead, volatile organic\ncompounds, and pesticides.\nSome types of flooring and the adhesives used to attach them can emit\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs). \"Offgassing\" refers to\nthe release of gases during the aging and deterioration of a material.\nThe Carpet and Rug Institute had created standards for low-VOC carpets\nand rugs (see resource below).\n\nComfortable homes make it unlikely that\nindividuals will unknowingly take actions that can harm their health.\nFor example, excess cold may cause people to use stoves and ovens for\nheating, leading to chronic and perhaps acute exposure to carbon monoxide.\nHumidifiers may be installed to relieve an excessively dry environment,\ncreating extra moisture that can contribute to molds and foster the growth\nof dust mites, both of which are asthma\ntriggers."}

The NHDS is a national probability survey designed to provide information on characteristics of inpatients discharged from non-Federal short-stay hospitals in the United States. Each year the NHDS collects data from a sample of approximately 300,000 inpatient records acquired from a national sample of about 500 hospitals. More information about the survey is available at the National Hospital Discharge Survey website.\n\nNCHS has created data files with air pollution information, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, specifically designed to be linked to NHDS data files. The NHDS Pollution Exposure data files contain the NHDS admission dates and inpatient zip-code of residence with corresponding air pollution exposures. These air pollution exposures can be linked to in-house NHDS files by zip-code and admission date to obtain an analytic file with both air pollution exposures and discharge information. Because residential zip-code and admission date are in-house variables, the NHDS Pollution Exposure data files and the in-house NHDS data files are available through the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC). Information about the RDC is available at the Research Data Center website.\n\nPollution measurements at air monitoring locations were obtained from the EPA. See Air Quality System (AQS) Data for Downloading to access that data.. For each discharge, pollution exposure measurements for seven days and six weeks prior to the date of admission were averaged from monitors within 20 and 5 miles of the geo-coded zip-code center. Exposures for carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) were averaged using distance weighting, where measurements from monitors closer to the zip-code center contributed more than those farther away. Averages for particles (PM2.5 and PM10) were calculated without distance weights because particulate matter is more homogeneously distributed. Because not all NHDS inpatients live near monitors, most discharge records will have missing values for one or more pollutants after linkage. More records have values for exposures calculated using 20-mile radii than using 5-mile radii."}

Like the content of a hot dog, maybe you don't really want to know what's in it. But for your own good, you need to know. So read on.\n\nAccording to air-quality expert and author Bill Logan, who examined the air New Yorkers breathe, found \"a bizarre brew\" of bacteria, pollen, clothing fiber, fungus, tire rubber, cooking fat, carbon emissions - and dead skin cells - according to the New York Daily News.\n\nEven a 'hipster sample'\n\nLogan, the paper said, grabbed a \"spore sucker\" of his own design and joined a reporter for a tour of the city, sampling air as he went. The results were nothing short of surprising.\n\nOf course, some of the results were expected: The pollution in midtown and the South Bronx; pollen and fungus present in neighborhoods where there are lots of trees. But in each breath individual New Yorkers take - estimated at about 33,000 per resident per day - they may also be inhaling spores, microscopic bits of glass, starch, fat and bacteria.\n\nSome residents, when told what they could be breathing, were stunned. But Logan - author of the book, \"Air: The Restless Shaper of the World\" - said many of the elements he found, such as fat, are pretty normal.\n\nAir samples from midtown, not surprisingly, contained a high number of skin cells from many races, a reflection of the area's vast diversity. Chinatown, meanwhile, had noticeable spikes in starch and fat particles, \"probably from the cooking of rice and noodles,\" Logan estimated.\n\nIndeed, what is found in a particular neighborhood's air sample is like an invisible identifier of its lifestyle, business and even culture, Logan told the paper. That would explain the samples in Williamsburg - elevated levels of blue jeans, nail polish, tire rubber and pollen, which he dubbed \"the hipster sample.\"\n\nJudith Zelikoff, a professor in the department of Environmental Medicine at New York University, told the Daily News she wasn't surprised by the range of aerosols found in the air.\n\n\"A lot of things that are in the air are a kind of a signature of what's in that environment,\" she said.\n\nLots of everything - but especially exhaust\n\nRegarding the potential danger of any particular aerosol, including that from black latex from tires and carbon, wasn't clear absent a pollen count. \"Without concentration,\" Zelikoff said, \"we can't say if it's going to be hazardous. But we can say, 'Yet, it is there.' Or even why it's there and how it got there.\"\n\n\"It's everywhere,\" added Logan. \"We have to wake up to how remarkable this stuff is. The common, everyday stuff.\"\n\nAccording to a graphic on the Daily News site, here is what Logan found in certain regions of the city:\n\n-- In the South Bronx, soot and large bits of rubber were contained in the samples, including a few \"deflated\" pollen grains.\n\n-- In Elmhurst, tire rubber along with plant fungi and bits of glass, perhaps from airplanes, were heavy."}

{"text":"The purpose of this bulletin is to alert field personnel to the potential carcinogenicity of whole diesel exhaust and to enumerate the specific gaseous and particulate components that comprise the emission from diesel engines.\n\nRecent animal studies in rats and mice confirm an association between the induction of cancer and exposure to whole diesel exhaust. The lung is the primary site identified with carcinogenic or tumorigenic responses following inhalation\nexposure. Limited epidemiologic evidence suggests an association between occupational exposure to diesel engine emissions and lung cancer. The consistency of these toxicologic and epidemiologic findings suggest that a potential\noccupational carcinogenic hazard exists in human exposure to diesel exhaust.\n\nNIOSH estimates that approximately 1.35 million workers are occupationally exposed to the combustion products of diesel fuel in approximately 80,000 workplaces in the United States (NIOSH 1983). Workers who are likely to be exposed\nto diesel emissions include mine workers, bridge and tunnel workers, railroad workers, loading dock workers, truck drivers, fork-lift drivers, farm workers, and auto, truck, and bus maintenance garage workers.\n\nParticulates (soot) in diesel exhaust are composed of solid carbon cores that are produced during the combustion process and that tend to form chain or cluster aggregates. As much of 15% to 65% of the mass of particulate emissions\n(soot) of diesel engines is made up of organic compounds absorbed onto the surface of the particulates. Among these compounds is a group of compounds known as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons( PAHs), several of which are carcinogens\n(IARC 1983).\n\nPermissible exposure limits (PELs) established by OSHA and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for some gases typically found in diesel exhaust are listed in Table 1 along with the recommended exposure limits (RELs)\nestablished by NIOSH.\n\nOSHA, MSHA, and NIOSH exposure limits relevant to the particulate fraction of diesel engine emissions are listed in Table 2. Because diesel emission particulates are of respirable size, the presence of diesel equipment contributes\nto the total burden of respirable dust present in an occupational environment. Existing limits for occupational exposures to other respirable dust also limit exposure to the particulate fraction of diesel emissions.\n\nAlthough no specific recommendations are being made from a compliance standpoint, compliance officers should be aware of the various components of diesel exhaust as this knowledge may aid in evaluating a worker's exposures or the\nenvironment in which he or she works.\n\nPlease disseminate this bulletin to all Area Offices, State Plan States and Consultation Project Officers."}
{"text":"\"Doctors too need education\"\n\n0 Comments\n\nIssue Date: Jan 15, 1998\n\nDr S K Chabbra, reader and head of the department of cardiorespiratory physiology, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, New Delhi, is among the few doctors to conduct an epidemiological study relating air pollution to respiratory morbidity among adults and children in Delhi. In an interview to Priti Kumar, he spoke about the role of doctors in educating the people about health hazards due to pollution\n\nOn the results of the study on childhood asthma among Delhi children:\nThe preliminary results show that nearly 16 per cent of the children, in the age group of five-16 years, suffer from asthma. If we add old asthma cases - those who had asthma in the past but do not have it now -- the prevalence is around 19-20 per cent. We have selected some 15,000 children from different schools in east, west, south, and central Delhi. Standardised questionnaires were given to the children and were answered by their parents. We carried out examination of selected children for the lung function testing to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nOn the results of the ongoing study relating air pollution to respiratory morbidity among adults in Delhi:\nThe results have not yet been analysed in detail. Air pollution may not be the only cause for respiratory morbidity. Other aspects like the type of fuel, cigarette smoking, general economic levels and proximity to industries have to be considered before arriving at any conclusion.\n\nOn how the respiratory morbidity study is being carried out:\nThe study has been undertaken exclusively for adults residing in Delhi for more than 10 years. We have selected people residing in selected areas of Delhi where there are permanent air quality monitoring stations. We are comparing different areas of Delhi, that we know differ in air quality. We then try to see if differences in the respiratory health of the selected persons can be explained with respect to the air quality. The health status of different segments of the population is compared. We are also measuring the lung function and estimating the appearance of chronic respiratory symptoms like chronic cough (persistence of cough for more than three months in a year), chronic production of phlegm and sputum, breathlessness, and wheezing, that are characteristics of asthma.\n\nWe are measuring what proportion of each of these segments is suffering from either of these symptoms. So this will give us an idea of the total respiratory morbidity, the prevalence of symptoms, the types of respiratory diseases, and the lung function status.\n\nOn whether any recommendations, based on this study, are being furnished to the ministry of health and family welfare or the Indian Council of Medical Research:\nNot yet. This is our first study and once it is over we will surely give some useful data to the health planners to work on.\n\nOn whether air pollution creates new asthmatics: A ir pollution does not create new asthmatics. However, it is known to increase the severity of asthma. In India, it is very difficult to say if the number of persons suffering from respiratory diseases has increased due to air pollution. There is no data to prove this as epidemiological studies have not been carried out in India. However, studies in the west have shown that the prevalence of childhood asthma among children in the us and the uk has increased from eight to nine per cent in the early 70s to the recent figure of 17 to 18 per cent. However, it must be noted that the air quality there, has improved over this period of time. Thus, if we are asked to explain the increase in asthma cases in the west, we can say that air pollution may not be responsible for it.\n\nOn the current levels of pollution in Delhi:\nThe Patel Chest Institute does not have the resources to measure the pollution levels. We are therefore, going by the data provided by the Central Pollution Control Board. According to their data, it is the suspended particulate matter that exceeds the permissible limit dangerously.\n\nOn whether lack of data on the link between air pollution and health is responsible for the apathy among doctors and people:\nWe don't need any data to prove that air pollution is bad for us. A lot of it is common sense. Doctors say that they cannot educate people as they lack the data. But, if they really want, they can still find a way out. Take the case of vehicular pollution. If people are aware that emissions from vehicles cause pollution which might affect their health, they will take care to keep their vehicles in proper condition. But they do not bother to do so. They do it only when they are forced by the police.\n\nOn doctors' role in informing people about effects of pollution:\nDoctors do have an important role to play as the patients will certainly listen to a doctor. But then, doctors come from the same society, where the level of awareness on these issues is extremely poor. Doctors too need education regarding this. It is my impression that people are not concerned about the effects of pollution. In fact, there is a general feeling among people that air pollution is not affecting them. They, however, agree that it might be affecting other people. Hence it is necessary to educate the doctors so that they can inform and educate their patients about it. Health education will play a key role in the efforts to solve the pollution problem. Pollution control cannot be effective just by enforcing a law. Motivation and education alone can help us to achieve the goal."}
{"text":"Summary of Aprovecho's Summer Stove Camp, 2006\nBy Dean Still and Nordica MacCarty, September 6, 2006\n\nAprovecho Camp 2006 02\n\nStove Camp 2006 was extremely interesting, especially because we had experts here who could help define what is known, figure out what needed to be done to expand the state of knowledge, and then, most importantly, have the tools to accomplish the experiments.\n\nThe gases, however, are only a part of the picture: particles also play an important role in the atmosphere. We learned that elemental (black) carbon particles produced in flames have a warming effect 1000 times greater than CO2 per gram, while organic carbon (white) particles produced by smoldering have a cooling effect 150-200 times stronger than CO2. Thankfully, Chris Roden had brought his and Dr. Tami Bond's ARACHNE system which could measure the composition of the total PM to determine what percentage of black or white particles were produced by the stoves above. Chris, Damon and Nordica were at the lab till 11pm having a great time testing these stoves. Results should be available soon.\n\nDoing this kind of research in a small lab in Creswell, Oregon for no money is what ETHOS stove camp is all about!\n\nThe publicized theme of this year's camp was a competition to design the cleanest-burning fan stove. Two categories, side feed and top feed were awarded prizes. The top feed prize went to Dr. Paul van der Sluis for the Philips fan stove. The side feed Rocket stove with fan developed by Roger and Sule of Colorado State was the cleanest burning side feed stove. Congratulations to the winners!"}
{"text":"As sure as April brings showers and May brings flowers, June brings ozone pollution warnings. These alerts come to us by way of air quality reports in our local weather forecasts, and they let us know when ground-level ozone pollution, the primary component of smog, reaches a dangerous level in the air we breathe. We see the alerts almost exclusively in the summer because sunlight and hot weather spur chemical reactions between air pollutants, thereby forming ground-level ozone and, in turn, smog.\n\nSmog, then, fills the air until it's hard for some of us to breathe, especially babies and children, whose lungs are more delicate and less developed. Babies, children, senior citizens, and people who suffer from asthma, allergies, breathing problems, and lung disease bear the brunt of the suffering from smog, but scientific research shows us that no matter how healthy, we all are vulnerable to this dangerous pollutant.\n\nAnyone who spends time outdoors in the summer may be affected, and millions of Americans live in areas where the national ozone health standards are exceeded. (Conversely, ozone in the upper atmosphere -- the good kind of ozone -- forms a layer that protects life on earth from the sun's harmful rays.)\n\nToday until midnight, March 22, is final day of the EPA's public comment period for this ozone pollution standard. Please join tens of thousands of others and take a moment to send EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson a message, urging her to adopt the strongest possible standards for ozone pollution.\n\nAs I write, officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are wading through the tens of thousands of letters Earthjustice supporters and their counterparts at MomsRising, Pesticide Action Network and United Farmworkers sent asking the agency to protect rural kids from pesticides.\n\nThese 42,000 people\u2014along with 51 groups in 18 states\u2014are publicly supporting our petition for safety standards to protect children who grow up near farms from the harmful effects of pesticide 'drift'\u2014the toxic spray or vapor that travels from treated fields\u2014and for immediate no-spray buffer zones around homes, schools, parks and daycare centers for the most dangerous and drift-prone pesticides.\n\nAs EPA officials complete their tally, I hope they're paying particular attention to the personal stories people shared in their letters. People like Cynthia Piper, of Lakewood, OH, who after seeing children exposed to pesticides suffer from deformities, fought for a right-to-know pesticide spray ordinance in her town. Or JeanAnn Hurst of Chowchilla, CA, whose son was exposed to the nerve-gas pesticide chlorpyrifos while on school grounds. You can find Cynthia and JeanAnn's stories on our interactive map.

Well, Earthjustice and other clean air advocates have finally reached the summit, putting an end to litigation involving a loophole that gave industrial facilities a free pass to ignore pollution limits whenever plants start up, shut down or malfunction.\n\nToday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the American Chemistry Council (and others) a request to review the case, which Earthjustice won in December 2008.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision is huge for us, but it's folks on the ground (the ones that live near these plants and their skyrocketing emissions) that are cheering the loudest -- people like Jesse Marquez: who lives three miles from a Wilmington, California Tesoro Energy Corp's refinery which caught fire last September because of a malfunction. Jesse was at the scene, taking pictures and recalling the terrible mixture of crude oil and diesel fuel filling the air for 6 hours.\n\nThe microblogging site Twitter is poised to hit a major milestone: sometime in the next day or so one lucky Twitter user is expected to send out the ten billionth tweet (real-time counter is here).\n\nWhether you love exchanging ideas in 140-character bursts, or if U H8 the resulting abbrevs, people will be paying very close attention to the string of words that mark Twitter's ascension into the big, big timeTeresa de Anda, Californians for Pesticide Reform.

{"text":"According to the US Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) studies of human exposure to air pollution\nindicate that indoor levels of many pollutants may be 2-5 times (and\noccasionally more than 100 times) higher than outdoor levels which\ncauses particular concerns as it is estimated that most people spend as\nmuch as 90% of their time indoors. Many pollutants in the typical home\nor office are at least 10 times higher than in outdoor air. Modern\nbuildings are constructed so tightly that odors and pollutants are\ntrapped inside. Our body recognizes the\npoor air quality and alerts us constantly through allergies to the\nfumes, dust, dander, pollen, mites and mold. Additional manifestations\nare exhibited through fatigue, itchy eyes, throat and sinus irritations,\nsneezing, sleep disorders, ear infections and asthma. Ultimately, our\nindoor environment is often an unhealthy place.\n\nEvery year at least 6,000 new chemical compounds are developed. Many of them are used indoor at home or work. Pollutants such as mold, mildew, bacteria, viruses, tobacco smoke, grease, pollen, dirt, asbestos, lead and numerous other contaminants affect our breathing and our health. Then allow them to circulate in today's nearly airtight indoor environment such as your common households. No wonder our indoor air is, on average, 2 to 10 times as polluted as the worst outdoor air. We base all of our information from well researched resources such as that from the environmental protection agency. \n\nInside your home or dwelling, about 40 pounds of dust is generated per 1,500 square feet per year. Each speck of dust serves as a means of locomotion - meaning a way to get into your lungs - for about 40,000 dust mites and illness-causing bacteria, germs, and viruses. Dust mites comprise over 50% of the weight of the average pillow.\n\nSimple Facts\n\nAccording to the American College of Allergies, 50% of all illness is caused by indoor air pollution.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declares that indoor air is anywhere from 2 to 10 times more hazardous than outdoor air.\n\nThe EPA also informs us that the number one environmental health problem in the United States is the indoor air quality.\n\nMany of today's households and building are enclosed sealing air inside containing many pollution sources. As a result, natural air-cleansing agents such as ozone and negative ions are kept out, while contaminants are kept in.\n\nA recent study found that the allergen level in heavy-insulated homes is 200% higher than it is in ordinary homes.\n\nAccording to Scientific America, a baby crawling on the floor inhales the proportionate amount of 4 cigarettes a day, as a result of the out-gassing of carpets, molds, mildews, fungi, dust mites, etc.\n\nMost people spend well over 90% of their time indoors. In which case, indoor air is going to impact our health far more than outdoor air.\n\nThe EPA informs us that 6 out of 10 homes and buildings are \"sick\", meaning they are hazardous to your health to occupy as a result of airborne pollutants.\n\nHow do I get rid of these harmful pollutants?\n\nPhysicians are now discovering that the solution to the problems of many of these people is not in medicine but in reducing the pollutants in the air they breathe. One of the most effective ways to remove harmful pollutants is by purchasing an air purifier.\n\nDilution, Removal and Neutralization are three ways to improve indoor air quality.\n\nDilution : Bringing in outside air is the conventional solution. It is, however, often inefficient, can be costly, and not usually appropriate for odor control. If the outside air is polluted, it can make your indoor air quality worse.\n\nNeutralization : The most effective way to neutralize air pollution is using a combination of technologies that include the ultraviolet (UV) lights, hydroxyl radicals, Negative Ions and Ozone, the combination of which promotes the destruction of bacteria, viruses, bacteria, fungi and other pollutants, including mold spores, as well as sanitizing surfaces and the air, controlling odors and reducing static electricity\n\nSurround Air Purifiers XJ-3000C by Surround Air. This unit features\n5 air purification technologies:\n\n~ High Efficiency\nParticulate Air Filters (HEPA) are presently the most efficient\nfiltration device available on the market today capturing 99.97% of\nparticles in the air. Surround Air is able to capture a high volume of\nfloating dust and numerous other particles including many ionized\nparticles that would otherwise simply settle to the ground.\n~ A Germicidal UV (ultraviolet) light\nwhich are scientifically proven to destroy a large variety of\nmicrobiological contaminates, including viruses, germs, bacteria,\nand fungi (such as mold). UV lamps are readily used in the medical field\n(including hospitals) to sanitize rooms and equipments, in order to\nprevent the spread of illness and disease. UV light has also been\nrecommended by the Centers for Disease Control for this purpose. ~ An Activated Carbon Air\nFilter which specializes in capturing and neutralizing chemicals, gases,\nodors and cigarette smoke. It is the most absorbent of all air filter\ntypes.\n~ An Air Ionizer which will increase the effectiveness of an air filter\nby increasing the size of the particles drawn into the filter. Negative\nions produced by an ionizer cause airborne particles to magnetically\nclump together, forming larger particles which then are more easily\ncaptured by the filter. Negative ions are also capable of circulating\nthroughout a room removing particulate far away from where the air\nfilter is located.

{"text":"Outdoor Pollution and Lung Function Effects\n\nIn 1996, the city of Atlanta took dramatic steps to improve the city's air quality for the summer Olympics. In the process, it showed how reducing air pollution can improve lung function.\n\nWhat city officials did -- switching to rapid transit and buses that ran on natural gas instead of diesel -- decreased asthma attacks by up to 44% in children and ozone concentrations by 28%, the CDC reported in a study in 2001 in The Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nRecommended Related to Lung Disease\/Respiratory Problems\n\nImportant\nIt is possible that the main title of the report Cystic Fibrosis is not the name you expected. Please check the synonyms listing to find the alternate name(s) and disorder subdivision(s) covered by this report.\n\n\"It seemed easier to breathe,\" recalls Carol Lincoln, 44, who attended the summer games. The skies were \"bright and blue\" instead of \"the sooty gray we're so used to,\" she says. \"Things seemed cleaner. It was so obvious that we talked about it.\"\n\nStudy author Michael Friedman, MD, of the CDC says the results showed that reducing air pollution improves lung health. Here's what we know about how the two affect each other:\n\nWhat are the different types of pollution?\n\nOzone, the primary component of smog, is created by a chemical reaction that occurs when sunlight interacts with particulates (soot) from motor vehicle exhaust, gasoline vapors, and dust from power plants.\n\nParticulate matter, also known as particle pollution, includes nitrates, sulfates, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles; it is a complex mixture of tiny particles and liquid droplets.\n\nNitrogen dioxide, or NO2, is one of a group of highly reactive gasses. NO2 forms quickly from emissions from cars, trucks, buses, power plants, and off-road equipment. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), this compound reacts with ammonia, moisture, and other compounds to form small particles. These small particles penetrate deeply into sensitive parts of the lungs and can cause or worsen respiratory disease, such as emphysema and bronchitis, and can aggravate existing heart disease, leading to increased hospital admissions and premature death.\n\nCarbon monoxide, or CO, is an odorless, colorless gas formed when carbon in fuel isn't completely burned. Higher levels of CO occur in areas with heavy traffic congestion. It is a component of motor vehicle exhaust, which contributes about 56% of all CO emissions nationwide. Other sources are cigarette smoke, wood and gas stoves, and industrial emissions.\n\nSulfur dioxide gases are formed when fuels containing sulfur, like oil and coal, are burned, or when metals are extracted from ore. It interacts with other pollutants and can be harmful.\n\nLead is now mostly found near waste incinerators, utilities, and battery manufacturers. Lead emissions from gasoline have declined by 95% since the EPA began regulating clean air standards more than three decades ago.\n\nPollutants are regulated by the EPA.\n\nHow do the different types of pollutants in air pollution affect lung function?\n\nDennis Ownby, MD, chief of allergy-immunology at the Medical College of Georgia, tells WebMD that it's difficult to separate the negative effects of the various pollutants because they all damage the lungs, kill protective cells, and can cause cardiovascular disease and heart attacks."}

Air Filtration cleans air through the removal of sub-micron particulate, gases and odors. If you are plagued by allergies or asthma, an air filter might help you. Air filters are the best tools for eradicating allergens from the house.

However, it seems like majority of us are not aware of it. To let us aware of how pollution air is today, the City Lung is designed by Belgian designer Corentin Dombrecht. The City Lung is a lung shapes structure installed that can be installed in any busy streets and will work as a pollution meter.

{"text":"share this story\n\nToday the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a draft pollution standard for soot that will reduce one of the most dangerous forms of air pollution, saving thousands of lives and preventing tens of thousands of heart attacks every single year. Unfortunately, it is sure to come under attack by big polluters, so we will need to stand together to defend it.\n\nSoot, also known as particulate pollution, is the most harmful type of air pollution. Soot pollution is a significant health threat because these very fine particles, which come from burning fossil fuels, can be inhaled and lodge in the lungs, causing serious heart and lung problems.\n\nCoal plants are the biggest source of soot, and a recent study found that soot pollution from coal plants causes 13,000 premature deaths, 20,000 heart attacks, and $100 billion in health care costs annually. This new standard will save thousands of lives.\n\nTo put a face to all these numbers and health risks, I only have to think of six-year-old asthma-sufferer Peter Wasserman who lives in Chicago near one of the Fisk and Crawford coal plants, who we featured in ads that we ran in Chicago calling for those plants to be cleaned up or retired.\n\nI'll never forget her opening words in this opinion piece she wrote for the Chicago TribunePeter's asthma began with a cough that wouldn't go away. Now that he's been diagnosed, we've had to learn what his \"triggers\" are. Unfortunately, he has a really tough time on bad ozone days or when it's really humid and really hot. While other families are able to go to the zoo or the park, my kids can't. It's very hard to explain to a 6-year-old who wants to do nothing but play outside that he can't because the air quality isn't good enough.\n\nAs a mom, I know that parents are united in calling for clean air for our kids, so we support this move by the EPA. As the hot summer days roll by and our cities and towns face Code Orange and Red air quality alerts that keep our kids and other vulnerable populations indoors, soot is one of the major causes of these dangerous days.\n\nWhat's more, soot pollution is also the cause of hazy views in our national parks. Asthma and you can't even enjoy the iconic views in places like the Grand Canyon or the Great Smoky Mountains? Come on.\n\nThis National Ambient Air Quality Standard establishes the standard for what is and isn't clean air, and the Sierra Club strongly supports this update of the soot standard.\n\nOnce finalized, this pollution safeguard will require localities to reduce pollution from vehicles, power plants, and other industrial sources -- moves that improve our health and our economy.\n\nBut, as usual, big polluters like the coal industry are spending millions to prevent these life-saving clean air safeguards, putting their profits before the public's health and putting American lives at risk.\n\nLet's fight back. Industrial particle pollution, or soot, from power plants is dangerous and kills hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. That's why new life saving standards should be put in place to protect our kids and families. Join us in thanking the EPA for this draft safeguard and working in the weeks ahead to finalize a strong version of the standard.\n\nWe should not be subsidizing the destruction of our planet. Fossil fuels are literally cooking our planet, polluting our air and draining our wallets. Why should we continue to reward companies to do that?\n\nAn entire article with absolutely no proof whatsoever as to what caused the boy's asthma. Could it be genetic? Could it be from insect or other infestations in the building? Is there smoking in his house? There are hundreds of potential causes for asthma and any scientist worth his degree will tell you that.\n\nNo, this article is a convenient excuse to impugn an entire industry.

(TC, EC)\n\nWithin the North American Emission Control Area (ECA), which covers the majority of waters surrounding Canada and the United States and the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, ships must significantly reduce their air pollutant emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Canada's health and environment will greatly benefit from the emissions reductions the ECA standards will provide.\n\nEC with Transport Canada (TC) is developing regulations to implement Canada's portion of the ECA. EC will revise its sulphur standards in the Diesel Fuel Regulations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 to implement the ECA in accordance with the IMO requirement and in alignment with U.S. regulatory actions.\n\nAs marine transportation accounted for 81 kt of SOx in Canada in 2008, this will significantly contribute to the reduction of air pollutants.\n\nPerformance expectations:\n\nThe ECA standards will enter into effect on August 1, 2012.\n\nWork to finalize regulations will continue.\n\nProgram Activity 3.2: Climate Change and Clean Air\n\n2.1.15 Continue to support a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Railway Association of Canada that ensures the rail industry continues to improve emission performance during the 2006\u20132010 period. (EC, TC)\n\nThe MOU with the Railway Association of Canada expired in December 2010. Air pollutant regulations under the Railway Safety Act are being developed by Transport Canada. Visit this website for more information.\n\nIn 2008, rail transportation accounted for 9% of transportation nitrogen oxide air pollutant emissions. Transport Canada's and EC's activities in this area will contribute to the reduction of air pollutants.\n\n2.1.22.2 Programs focused on supplying financial aid and developing capacity to reduce GHGs and smog-forming pollutants through adoption of emission-reducing technologies and practices: Implement a national Vehicle Scrappage Program to encourage Canadians to retire their old high-polluting vehicles (models 1995 or earlier) and to choose more sustainable transportation options. (EC)\n\nThe Vehicle Scrappage program offered rewards\u2013such as free transit passes, car sharing memberships, $300 cash and rebates on the purchase of cleaner vehicles\u2013to Canadians who retired their older, highly-polluting personal vehicles. The program was mainly delivered though Summerhill Impact, a not-for-profit organization with a network of local agents that delivered the program in each province and developed partnerships with incentive providers, vehicle recyclers, and call centres.\n\nThe program also directly contributed to the achievement of FSDS Target 1.1: Climate Change Mitigation.\n\nPerformance expectations:\n\nThe program ended on March 31, 2011.\n\nProgram Activity 3.2: Climate Change and Clean Air\n\n2.1.31 Work with the U.S to reduce transboundary emissions under the Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement. (EC, HC)\n\nThis activity will be implemented through continued work under the Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement (1991) and its three Annexes committing to work on (1) Acid Rain; (2) Scientific and Technical Activities and Economic Research; and (3) Ozone. Consideration is being given to adding a fourth Annex covering particulate matter (PM). The Canada-U.S. Air Quality Committee is responsible for administering work under the Agreement. It publishes a joint progress report every two years. Visit this website for more information.\n\nThis activity contributes to achieving Target 2.1 by contributing to the reduction of transboundary air pollution.\n\nEC will continue to conduct coordinated science activities under Sub-committee 2 of Canada\u2013U.S. Air Quality Agreement.\n\nPerformance expectations:\n\nFor 2012\u20132013, these include:\n\nMeeting regular commitments under the Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement (AQA) which focuses on reducing emissions of acid rain and smog forming pollutants; and\n\nParticipating in the annual meetings of the Canada-U.S. Air Quality Committee, and making progress in advancing discussions on a PM Annex to the AQA, and in further discussions\/negotiations, where appropriate, to support ongoing bilateral collaboration to reduce transboundary air pollution.\n\n2.1.32 Submit air pollutant inventories to meet international reporting requirements using National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) to the UN Economic Commission for Europe to meet the reporting obligations of the Protocols ratified under the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution). (EC)\n\nCanada's domestic and international obligations (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), Canada\u2013U.S. Air Quality Agreement, etc.) will be met via the collection submission of data on emissions on key air pollutants from industrial facilities and\/or comprehensive emissions data (which includes facility reported data and additional area source calculations).\n\nThe NPRI data is a key mechanism for allowing Canada to track progress against the various reporting obligations and demonstrate compliance with stated obligations.\n\nPerformance expectations:\n\nThe timeline for submission of data to meet the various reporting obligations varies. A key deadline is the annual deadline of February 15th to submit emissions data for key pollutants to the UNECE and the collection of this data is done through the NPRI process.\n\nProgram Activity 3.2: Climate Change and Clean Air\n\n2.1.35 Participate in negotiations for revisions of the Gothenburg Protocol to Reduce Ozone, Acidification and Eutrophication under the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution. (EC, HC)\n\nThis activity will be implemented through Environmental Stewardship Branch participation in the negotiations to revise the multi-pollutant, multi-effect Gothenburg Protocol under Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP).\n\nThis protocol contains emissions limits for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. The revisions will also include commitments on particulate matter.\n\nCanada's commitments under this protocol will be based on its domestic and bilateral approaches under the Air Quality Management System and the Canada\u2013U.S. Air Quality Agreement, respectively.\n\nThese commitments, once fulfilled, will serve to reinforce Canada's commitment to addressing air pollution.\n\nPerformance expectations:\n\nAdvancement of Canada's positions on revisions to the Gothenburg Protocol by participating in the 50th session of the Working Group on Strategies and Review, and the 30th Session of the Executive Body; and\n\nWork to ensure the flexibility that may enable Canada to ratify the Protocol is maintained, and that the text takes account of Canada's domestic and bilateral approaches.\n\nThe proposed extended producer responsibility regulations will be replaced by a Pollution Prevention Planning Notice.\n\nThe proposed Pollution Prevention Planning Notice will mandate importers and manufacturers of halocarbon refrigerants to implement stewardship programs, for responsible management of end-of-life ozone-depleting substances and HFCs used in refrigeration and air conditioning sectors.\n\nPerformance expectations:\n\nProposed Pollution Prevention Planning notice is expected to be published in Canada Gazette, Part I in 2012.\n\nProgram Activity 3.2: Climate Change and Clean Air\n\n2.1.37 Continue development of a North American proposal to phase-down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol and develop complimentary domestic regulations. (EC)\n\nHFCs are very potent greenhouses gases (GHG), which were initially introduced as a replacement for certain ozone-depleting substances. In collaboration with the U.S. and Mexico, Canada introduced a revised North American Proposal in April 2010 to add HFCs to the Montreal Protocol. The proposal would establish targets to reduce HFC consumption and production for both developing and developed countries. This is an approach which has a track record of success in eliminating similar substances used in the same sectors as HFCs. It is expected that this approach would contribute to avoiding significant emissions, thus minimizing negative impacts on the climate. This proposal was considered at the meeting of the Open-ended Working Group to the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in August 2011 and was further discussed at the Meeting of the Parties (MOP) in November 2011.\n\nIt is estimated that the cumulative benefits of the HFC phasedown amounts to reductions of 3,100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (MMT of CO2 equivalent) through 2020, and around 88,000 MMT of CO2 equivalent through 2050.\n\nPerformance expectations:\n\nCanada, the United States and Mexico are considering re-submitting a proposal in 2012\u20132013.\n\nContinue to participate in negotiation meetings with our partners, the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nParticipate in outreach activities to promote the amendment to the Montreal Protocol.\n\nDecision(s) and\/or declarations adopted at relevant international fora contribute to advancing the objectives of the proposed amendment.\n\nCompliance promotion relates to activities that are undertaken to increase the awareness and the understanding of new risk management instruments developed under Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999). Through these activities, information is provided regarding the compliance requirements, the benefits of complying with the law, as well as the consequences of non-compliance.\n\nThe approach to compliance promotion is collaborative and coordinated across the department's programs and regions and with the Enforcement Branch of Environment Canada. It is achieved using various tools and approaches such as website postings, letters and emails, brochures, site visits, responses to inquiries and information sessions.\n\nPerformance expectations:\n\nIn collaboration with enforcement and risk management, Compliance Strategies for risk management instruments related to air pollutants will be developed prior to publication in Canada Gazette-Part II Compliance promotion plan(s). Compliance strategies for sectors affected by the instruments related to air pollutants will also be developed."}

{"text":"A cluttered home is not only unsightly, but it can also be dangerous. There are several dangers associated with having an unorganized, messy house that are worth knowing about. It can help protect not only, but your kids, family members and friends.\n\nFalls\n\nIt probably makes sense that a cluttered home increases the risk of injury due to falls. However, you may not realize that falls are the leading cause of home injury death in the United States. According to the National Healthy Homes Training Center and Network (NCHH.org), accidental falls account for 33 percent of all home injury deaths. This includes tripping over clutter and other types of preventable accidents.\n\nRespiratory Problems\n\nExcessive clutter can aggravate or worsen symptoms associated with various respiratory diseases, such as asthma. According to the Alliance for Healthy Homes (AFHH.org), cluttered homes tend to contain higher levels of dust, which is a major cause of respiratory complications.\n\nThe hard part is ridding the home of dust when it's so cluttered that you can't physically reach certain items to clean and dust them. Dust continues to pile up and make the home even more dangerous to those with respiratory illnesses. The best way to avoid this issue is to declutter and thoroughly clean the home.\n\nIt all comes down to this: The less \"stuff\" in the home, the fewer places for dust to collect.\n\nRodents and Pests\n\nRodents, cockroaches, insects and other pests love clutter! Pests in the home can cause respiratory illnesses and other health problems. Decluttering infested areas can greatly reduce a pest problem. It also allows you to get at the infested areas to thoroughly clean and disinfect them.\n\nWeight Gain\n\nSome research links cluttered homes to obesity. If you think about it, it makes sense. If your gym equipment is piled high with boxes, or you have no idea where your running shoes may be, your odds of exercising are far lower than if these items were easily accessible.\n\nDr. Pamela Peeke, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the University of Maryland, told the New York Times, \"How are you going to shoot a couple of hoops with your son if you can't even find the basketball?\" She went on to tell a story about one of her patients whose garage was once \"a solid cube of clutter\" as she put it. The patient decluttered her garage and entire home after that, and eventually lost 50 lbs. along the way.\n\nIt's not that the actual process of decluttering a home promotes weight loss, but it does help from a psychological standpoint. Dr. David F. Tolin, director of anxiety disorders at the Institute of Living in Hartford and professor at Yale University, states \"It isn't a house problem. It's a person problem. The person needs to fundamentally change their behavior.\"\n\nEssentially, Tolin is saying that excessive clutter in the home is more of a psychological issue than anything. Extreme cases of house clutter \u2013 referred to as hoarding \u2013 is often a symptom of a bigger health problem, such as depression, emotional trauma, attention deficient disorder or mental illness.\n\nThe New York Times talked about one study that proved treatment of these illnesses can greatly improve the health of a person's home and body. It states, \"six months' therapy resulted in a marked decline in clutter in the patient's living space.\"\n\nIt's important to point out that just because you may have a cluttered basement, garage or entire home doesn't necessarily mean you suffer from some sort of mental illness. It's safe to say that most homes in America have at least a closet that could use some decluttering, so you're not alone.\n\nCategories\n\nMarket your dumpster rental or junk removal company with Hometown Internet Marketing and receive exclusive local leads.

{"text":"Pollution\n\nAir pollution has long been known to cause respiratory issues and increase the risk of cardiovascular problems, but new research suggests that the brain is not immune to the harmful effects of smog. A study conducted by the University of Southern California has determined that long-term exposure to air pollution may result in brain damage, according to AltTransport.\n\nResearchers exposed lab rats to the chemicals commonly found in smog for 150 hours over the course of a week. This is the equivalent of three weeks of traveling on the highways in southern California. Experts were able to determine that the pollution caused inflammation in brain cells, which can cause learning difficulty and memory issues.\n\nIndividuals who want to improve the air quality in their living spaces and remove harmful pollutants may want to purchase an air purifier. A device with a HEPA filter can greatly reduce the amount of particles in the air that are known to cause lung irritation.\n\nThe IQAir HealthPro Plus air purifier has a HyperHEPA filter that can trap ultra-fine particles that are smaller than 0.3 microns in size. The product can be helpful for individuals who suffer from respiratory conditions such as asthma.\n\nThe burning of resources such as coal has long been argued over due to the pollution it creates in the atmosphere. Now, 18 boilers owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority have been forced to shut down in an effort to reduce the waste distributed into the air, according to Forbes magazine.\n\nThe closing of the boilers will significantly reduce the amount of carbon emissions released by the Tennessee Valley Authority. This development is the result of a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Protection Agency, claiming that the emissions were extremely detrimental to the environment.\n\nAir pollution can cause a number of health complications and worsen respiratory illnesses such as asthma. Individuals who want to improve the air quality in their homes may want to consider purchasing an air purifier.\n\nThe IQAir HealthPro Plus air purifier is one example of a device that can remove harmful particles using a HyperHEPA filter. The product is designed to trap particles that are smaller than 0.3 microns in size, including dust, pollen and ragweed. The IQAir HealthPro Plus is also helpful for individuals who have an allergy to pet dander.\n\nAir pollution can result from a number of things, including car exhaust and the burning of fossil fuels. However, nature can also play a role in the amount of air pollution that develops in certain areas across the country, according to NTV, an ABC affiliate.\n\nRecently, health officials in Nebraska warned residents in the Lincoln region that air pollution levels have reached dangerous levels as a result of local wild fires. The problem arose when a number of small fires in a grassy ditch continued to grow and affect nearby homes.\n\nHealth officials say that the air is unsafe for individuals with respiratory problems, the elderly, young children and pregnant women.\n\nHomeowners who want to reduce the stress on their lungs by removing dangerous air particles from their living spaces may want to consider purchasing an air purifier. The IQAir HealthPro Plus is one example of a device that can remove lung irritants from homes.\n\nThe product is designed to trap ultra-fine particles that are smaller than 0.3 microns in size with its HyperHEPA filter. It is ideal for individuals with allergies to pet dander, pollen and dust. The IQAir Health ProPlus air purifier can also remove smoke and pollution within up to 900 square feet.\n\nPower plants are beneficial to regions in need of electricity, but they can do substantial damage to the environment. In an effort to make sure the air stays clean, environmental protection groups have recently united near downtown Milwaukee against a coal plant, according to the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel.\n\nAn air pollutant permit was issued by state regulators to the coal power plant, but environmental advocates say that it does not do enough to protect the public. Changes may be made to the permit over the next year.\n\n\"It's great that they're deciding,\" Jennifer Feyerherm, the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign representative, told the news source. \"We need a decision now because Milwaukee air quality is bad now.\"\n\nHomeowners in the region who want to breathe easily may want to consider purchasing the IQAir HealthPro Plus air purifier. While most air purifiers catch particles at 0.3 microns, the IQAir HealthPro Plus has a HyperHEPA filter to catch smaller particles that can cause allergic reactions and illness. By using an air purifier to capture unseen contaminants, homeowners may be able to remove more bacteria from the air they breathe.\n\nAs global warming becomes a growing concern, more local governments are doing their part to inform the public of ways they can protect themselves from the effects of pollution.\n\nBetween May and September, ozone forecasting is typically conducted across Georgia to assess ground-level ozone, according to The Weekly. In 2011, the process will begin in April and end in October, giving residents a full seven months of forecasting.\n\n\"We decided to extend ozone forecasting to give people the information they need to make informed choices to better protect their health - as well as to encourage them to take air-friendly actions that will reduce pollution throughout the year,\" Susan Zimmer-Dauphinee, program manager for the Ambient Monitoring Program, told the news source.\n\nFor homeowners who want to improve the air quality inside of their living spaces, the IQAir HealthPro Plus air purifier is the perfect solution. This device has a HyperHEPA filter that is designed to catch air particles from automobiles and smoke while killing bacteria.\n\nThe filter also has a product life of up to four years, requiring little maintenance from its users. It has advanced fan control and a carrying handle for ultimate convenience.\n\nSecond-hand smoke is no longer just a threat if you live with or stand close to someone smoking a cigarette. Harmful particles are making their way into the air at large, making it a larger pollution concern than some people initially thought.\n\nThe Kentucky Center for Smoke-free Policy (KCSP) conducted a research study of the air quality in Rowan County, Kentucky, and found that city dwellers outside Morehead were at risk for being exposed to harmful levels of second-hand smoke, though Morehead, which recently implemented smoke-free laws, had smoke levels six to seven times lower than the surrounding area, The Morehead News reports.\n\nBeyond implementing far-reaching legislation, there are a few simple steps people can take (such as avoiding congested thoroughfares) to avoid pollution. We can exercise a much greater amount of control over indoor spaces, however, by installing a high-quality air purifying system.\n\nFreshAirPro offers a range of top-rated, best-selling brands that implement the most sophisticated technologies available on the market today. Many of their machines combine a minimum of a HEPA filter as well as activated carbon to both filter particles and remove harmful chemicals and odors from the air.\n\nIt's been widely accepted that air pollution is bad for our health, but it hasn't been easy - even for scientists - to determine exactly why.\n\nHowever, a recent study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives found a link between diabetes patients' responses to air pollution and the way a normal respiratory system would function, University of Rochester Medical Center News reports. In the study, diabetes patients breathing in ultrafine particles found in polluted air experienced an activation of their blood platelets, a response which could increase the risk of heart disease.\n\n\"Our findings indicate that when someone is exposed to air pollution, the platelets become activated, which would make them more likely to trigger a heart attack,\" researcher Mark Frampton, M.D., said.\n\nAlthough there are measures that health-conscious individuals may take to avoid pollution-heavy areas outside, much greater control can be exercised over one's indoor air environment. Purchasing one of the top-market air purifiers available from FreshAirPro is the most effective means to clear pollutants and other airborne contaminants from the air that you breathe.\n\nWhile recent studies have revealed that air pollution is the leading cause of heart attacks, it may be difficult to gauge just how small the particles are that can lead to bodily harm, or which environments affect us the worst.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, spending time in traffic usually presents the largest risk factor, and it's generally recommended to find ways to spend less time on congested thoroughfares.\n\nMeanwhile, there are measures you can take to control the indoor air quality of your home. Installing an air purifying system is the most effective line of defense against pollution, allergens and a range of other respiratory ailments.\n\nPolluted air contains particles that are less than 10 microns wide, which is small enough to enter the lungs and cause inflammation, the news source reports. The IQAir HealthPro Plus, on other hand, comes with a HyperHEPA filter, the most advanced filter of its class, which is capable of tackling particulate matter as small as .003 microns in size. What's the advantage? You do the math.\n\nAmong the list of factors that contribute to the risk of heart attack published in the journal Lancet, traffic and air pollution weighed in as much higher threats than cocaine usage on a population-wide level.\n\nAccording to The Boston Globe's Deborah Kotz, traffic and air pollution are responsible for 12 percent of all heart attacks worldwide. Cocaine usage weighs in at about 1 percent, although this is taking into account that .04 percent of the population uses cocaine, compared to 100 percent who are exposed to pollution.\n\nGiven the associated health risks, individuals may want to take matters into their own hands when it comes to protecting the respiratory health of themselves and their families.\n\nInvesting in a professional grade air purifying system is the most effective way to eliminate airborne contaminants from your indoor air.\n\nThe IQAir HealthPro Plus comes with four advanced filtration technologies to combat a range of pollutants, including gases, odors and volatile compounds. The HealthPro Plus contains activated carbon, the best-known solution for removing harmful chemicals from the air.\n\nThis entry was posted in Pollution on February 24, 2011 by FreshAirPro.\n\nThose who live in major cities are probably well-aware of the risks associated with pollution, but a new study has found increasing evidence of the spread of ozone smog and its links to respiratory ailments.\n\n\"The study found that even at low levels, ozone smog increases the risk of asthma attacks and irritation in the respiratory system. Together with air pollution it can also contribute to heart attacks and strokes,\" Voice of America News reports.\n\nAccording to the news source, this affects at least 20 million Americans who suffer from asthma and take precautionary measures not to breathe too many bus fumes or subject themselves to more pollution than is necessary on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThose who wish to minimize their exposure to pollution should invest in a professional-grade air purifying system. The advanced filtration technologies found in FreshAirPro's line of top-quality brands will provide the best line of defense against pollutants as well as a range of other airborne contaminants. Look for air purifiers with HEPA filters and activated carbon to effectively tackle particulate matter as well as harmful chemicals and gases.\n\nThis entry was posted in Pollution on February 11, 2011 by FreshAirPro."}

Ozone, a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms, reacts chemically with lung tissue, causing coughing, wheezing, asthma attacks, decreased lung function, respiratory infection, lung inflammation and worsened lung diseases, and premature death.\n\nFor particle pollution, the report says that about 18.5 million people live with unhealthful year-round levels of particle pollution. Exposure to even low levels of particle pollution for long periods of time puts people at increased risk for asthma, lung damage and again premature death.\n\nFor short term particle pollution - incidences of increased particle pollution that last several hours to a few days - the report says 60 million Americans were exposed to ''too many days with unhealthy spikes in particle pollution.''

{"text":"We seem to be hearing more and more about molds \u2013 specifically toxic molds \u2013 and their potential for causing health problems. Most of us have heard or read about\nthe Texas couple who lost their home, a husband's career, and nearly a 3-year-old child from a blackish-green mold known as\n\nStachybotrys. Molds have always been present in our environment so what has changed to create so much concern today?\n\nMold 101 \u2013 An Overview Molds, or mildew as they are sometimes called, are types of fungi. They are not plants or animals, but are a separate kingdom of their own. Molds are very common in nature, and are\n\nalways\npresent in both indoor and outdoor air. They feed on dead organic matter, and play an important ecological role by decomposing dead leaves, grass, and other plant material. They reproduce through the release of microscopic spores into the air, much like a dandelion's seed, which can then grow into mold somewhere else, given the right conditions. Mold growth can range from powdery to woolly, and anywhere from white and pink to green, brown and black in color.\n\nTo grow, molds need a food source with high organic content, such as wood, paper, cotton, or other plant-derived materials. They also need moisture, which can come from leaks, floods, condensation, steam, or even\njust high humidity. If mold is found on a surface, then it either currently has, or in the past had, access to moisture.\n\nThe Mold \"Epidemic\"\nSo what's behind this sudden mold epidemic \u2013 are new homes moldier? Modern home design and materials, like fake stucco (a favorite mold food when wet), the way insulation can trap moisture behind walls, and the fact that homes are now more air tight, all tend to expose families for extended periods. This increases their chances of being impacted by mold. Stories like that of the Texas family who were driven out of their home by mold and subsequently awarded a multimillion-dollar settlement create media attention and in some cases, even hysteria. All this awareness feeds the epidemic and keeps this relatively new concept of toxic mold possibly \"living in our homes\" on our minds.\n\nHealth Concerns The most common health problems associated with exposure to mold spores are simply\n\nallergic reactions.\nAllergies to molds usually have the same effects as allergies to hay or pollen, and include symptoms like headaches, sinus problems, sore\nthroats, or coughing. When outdoor levels of molds are highest, such as during the fall leaf mold season, many people experience allergic reactions.\n\nExposures to certain molds now commonly thought of as \"toxic\nmolds\", can bring about more serious health effects and these cases attract most of the attention. As it turns out, it isn't the molds that are toxic, but rather chemicals that are produced by the molds. These\nchemicals, known as\n\nmycotoxins, are associated with\nthe mold's growth, digestion, and self defense processes. Mycotoxins, like the sting of a bee, are toxic to other organisms.\n\nThe greatest factor affecting the development of health problems though, is individual\nsensitivity. Certain people are naturally more sensitive than others to molds and the related mycotoxins. Those who are more susceptible usually include children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, such as\npatients undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nMold Investigations and Testing\nAn investigation for possible mold infestation begins with an inspection for visible mold growth. Whether or not such growth is noticeable, an inspection for signs of water damage, or areas with potential moisture sources is the next step.\n\nRelative humidity levels higher than 60% indoors can also encourage mold growth. If the indoor relative humidity is much higher than that measured outside, this may indicate that too much moisture is being trapped\ninside the house.\n\nWhether there is visible mold growing in a home, or just signs of water damage, or unusually high humidity levels, these are all problems requiring immediate attention.\n\nOnce the moisture source\nis eliminated, and the mold growth properly removed, the problem is usually solved; however, if for medical or legal reasons for instance, there is a need to know what species of molds are growing or releasing spores,\nand in what concentrations, then mold sampling and analysis may be necessary. Although homeowner test kits are becoming more available, they are still somewhat limited in what they can do. Trained and experienced\nprofessionals most accurately perform mold sampling, and microbiologists in accredited laboratories best do the analyses.\n\nMold Remediation\nWhen performing any mold remediation, it is first necessary to find and eliminate the moisture source. If the moisture problem is not resolved, the mold growth will return. So unless you are capable of fixing this primary problem, the first professional you should hire, whether it is a plumber, roofer, or perhaps even a landscaper, is one that gets rid of the moisture source, and ensures it will not return.\n\nUsually, the homeowner can safely manage small areas of non-toxic mold growth. Cleanup of extensive contamination, particularly if the HVAC system or large areas of the home are involved, should be remediated by\npersonnel with training and experience in handling environmentally contaminated materials. Mold levels can increase up to 100,000 times background levels during mold cleanup, possibly resulting in acute exposures.\n\nMold is Everywhere\nAlthough mold is indeed, everywhere, the potential impact of indoor mold growth is substantial. Exposure to certain toxic molds can result in serious health problems, some of which can be long term.\n\nThe early\ndetection and elimination of water infiltration problems are the key elements in the prevention of mold growth in a home. If the presence of excessive moisture is not recognized, but the typical symptoms of mold\nexposure are, the homeowner may benefit from the assistance of a qualified physician, home inspector, indoor air quality consultant, or a combination thereof. Provided the moisture and related mold problems are\nidentified and permanently remediated, the effected homeowners may once again take control over their indoor environment. Molds can then be left to do what we like to have them do \u2013 break down dead leaves and make great\ntasting mushrooms!\n\nJoel Loving is an Indoor Air Quality Consultant, Certified Mold Inspector, President of Environmental\nHealth Consultants, Inc., and a member of the general faculty at the University of Virginia Office of Environmental Health and Safety.

Nitrogen also contributes to acid rain, a form of pollution which the public by and large perceives as corrected, but which remains problematic in many regions. In the Catskill Mountains of New York, for instance, scientists have found that nitrogen plays a bigger role in the continued acidification of streams than sulfur dioxide, the levels of which have dropped precipitously since the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.

{"text":"Controlling Moisture in Schools\n\nThe deleterious effects of poor indoor-air quality (IAQ) on health, comfort, and performance are fairly well-known. Perhaps in no other buildings are they more difficult to combat than schools, for several reasons:\n\nSchools require high-density occupancy. Students in elementary and secondary schools typically occupy 500-sq-ft rooms at densities of 20 to 25 sq ft per student. Complicating matters is that school schedules allow little or no opportunity for students to relieve their surroundings if they sense they are having an allergic reaction. Additionally, teachers and other members of school staffs may not understand the nature of students' complaints that they are tired or \"don't feel good.\" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that asthma, often triggered by indoor exposure to mold, causes 10 million missed school days a year.1\n\nSchools are easy targets when it comes to cutting taxpayer expenditures. During the energy crunch of the 1970s, some of the greatest travesties in HVAC history were committed in schools. \"Strategies\" for conserving energy included the elimination of outside air, the removal of filters, and the shutting down of HVAC systems during occupancy. Today, systems are shut down for long unoccupied periods (e.g., winter and summer vacations), including when outdoor humidity is high. In the long run, such decisions result in toxic reactions among students. According to the EPA, in 1999, IAQ was reported unsatisfactory in about one in five public schools in the United States, while ventilation was reported unsatisfactory in about one in four.1\n\nDEHUMIDIFICATION OF OUTSIDE AIR\n\nSchools tend to have a high ratio of foundation footprint to floor area. Built with access and security foremost in mind, most schools are one- or two-story structures. As a result, a significant amount of interior space is exposed to surfaces at ground (cool) temperatures. Moisture is drawn to these spaces and difficult to evaporate into the building air.\n\nChildren tend to be more susceptible to allergens. Unlike adults, children tend not to know what makes them sick or how to avoid it. Additionally, fewer drugs are available to help reduce their sensitivities. That exposure to an allergen may not affect an adult staff member the way it does a student can make a student's claims of feeling sick all that more difficult to understand.\n\nThis article will discuss methods of controlling moisture \u2014 both that introduced by outside sources, such as ventilation air, and that introduced by inside ones, such as the human body, clothing, and cleaning \u2014 in schools through central HVAC systems.\n\nTraditionally, the control of humidity admitted with ventilation air has been addressed during design, with systems that cool ventilation air for summer air conditioning, causing moisture to condense on cooling coils. As the theory goes, the cool air will be heated by building occupants, interior lighting, and solar loads, resulting in 40- to 60-percent relative humidity in interior spaces. While this process can be traced on a psychrometric chart and, given the right coil leaving-air temperature, shown to be feasible, based on mold lawsuits alone, engineers in humid climates know it is only marginally effective (at best).\n\nFor outside ventilation air to be used effectively in the control of building humidity, it must be subcooled and reheated or chemically dehumidified with desiccants. No other method takes enough moisture from air streams to make up for internal gains from people, cleaning, etc. This is the case especially in schools and other spaces with high occupant loading.\n\nWhen outside conditions are warm and air is dehumidified as part of mechanical cooling, reheating and the resultant decrease in relative humidity are assumed to occur uniformly throughout an occupied space. Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. The air that is introduced into a space mixes (somewhat) with overhumidified air and condenses on cool surfaces (such as floor slabs and lower wall corners with low local air circulation). The air then is drawn up into the return-air plenum, where it absorbs the heat of the fluorescent-light ballasts and returns to the air-handling unit to be recombined with humid outside air.\n\nNote that saturated supply air does not have to condense water into puddles to cause mold growth. It can be absorbed into carpet and condense between the carpet and foundation slab, creating, in combination with nutrients tracked in from the outside, an ideal environment for fungal growth. When the carpet is cleaned, what are the chances of it being \"dried\" by saturated air coming, more or less, directly off the cooling coil? The moisture is much more likely to travel downward and condense on the cool slab than evaporate into humid air above.\n\nThe same process takes place between gypsum wallboard and its paper covering. In cool lower corners, wallboard is cooled by the slab, and moisture is absorbed through the paper covering, condensing in microscopic droplets. Fungal spores find nutrients in the adhesive that bonds the paper, and mold proliferates in the absence of light. Does \"vapor-barrier\" paint stop this moisture migration? No, it only slows it. Unfortunately for occupants, mold has all of the time in the world.\n\nSUBCOOLING\n\nThe behavior of moist, condensing air moving across a cooling coil is complex. The air exits the coil as a combination of air streams of differing temperatures containing entrained, microscopic water droplets. Its relative humidity is 90 to 100 percent, meaning it will condense on surfaces cooler than the discharge temperature. These include duct surfaces cooled by adjacent chilled- or domestic-water piping, the foundation slab, or an air leak to the outside. As for the entrained, microscopic water droplets, they will coalesce on steel or aluminum ductwork at the first sharp turn leaving the coil. A portion of the condensate will flow into the drain pan and, if the drain was installed properly (few are), flow safely to waste.\n\nSaturated supply air is dangerous in that if anything goes wrong, moisture has nowhere to condense but in ductwork. Wet duct liner never dries. Mold growing between it and cool metal duct can go undetected, spreading microorganisms throughout a building, for years.\n\nThe lesson to be learned is that effective dehumidification of outside air is active mechanical or desiccant dehumidification of outside air. If a desiccant wheel is used, outside air should be dried to the point that when it is mixed with return air and cooled to the discharge set point, there is no condensation on the cooling coil. Energy savings will accrue from the elimination of latent heat load on the coil and refrigeration equipment. Will these savings offset the energy used by the desiccant wheel? No; the basic laws of entropy still apply. The best one can do is to minimize the additional energy through careful design and make sure mold growth is prevented.\n\nAlternately, dehumidification can be accomplished by subcooling supply air with a cooling coil and reheating it to the discharge set point. The reheat coil can be a steam\/hydronic coil, a heat-recovery coil, or a \"hot-gas\" coil connected to the condenser side of the refrigerant circuit. Heat-recovery and hot-gas systems add complexity and maintenance, but decrease the energy required for dehumidification.\n\nBut what happens during unoccupied shutdowns? As part of a commissioning project, my office recently reviewed plans for a high school utilizing water-source heat pumps. The design team specified a heat pump employing a hot-gas reheat coil that allows supply air to be subcooled and reheated to well below saturation. Both the subcooling and reheating were to take place in the same self-contained cabinet, and the use of hot-gas reheat was to minimize energy consumption. Unfortunately, the sequence of operation was written to shut down the entire system during off hours, allowing moisture to migrate to cool spaces, condense, and foster mold growth. The solution was to use both humidistats and thermostats to control the heat pumps. During occupied hours, the thermostats have primary control, while the humidistats activate dehumidification via the hot-gas reheat coils when needed. During unoccupied hours, the heat pumps are controlled primarily by the humidistats, cooling is locked off, and heating is in a setback mode. In this manner, dehumidification is continuous on an as-needed basis. Does this require more energy than simply shutting down the entire system when the school is unoccupied? Yes. Would the school rather go to court to fight a mold lawsuit? Probably not.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nReturning to the issue of water-source-heat-pump control, some promising advances have been made in dehumidification via refrigerant reheat. Notably, combinations of liquid and gas reheat that greatly enhance control and effectiveness are now available. In the past, the application of heat-pump systems suffered because the control and temperature differential required for positive dehumidification was lacking. The short-cycling of oversized heat pumps causes condensed moisture to be re-entrained into air streams during extended off cycles and reduces dehumidification effectiveness. Improved hot-gas\/liquid reheat allows heat pumps to operate in a steady-state manner and continuously wring moisture from air, eliminating re-entrainment during off cycles. This promises to make energy-smart heat-pump systems good IAQ performers.\n\nREFERENCE\n\nIn humid climates, one of the fastest ways to turn a building into a mold incubator is to shut off the outside-air ventilation system and leave restroom and other exhaust fans on during unoccupied hours. The resulting negative pressure will pull humid air into the building walls and interstitial spaces. Moisture in the air will condense on cool interior surfaces either after the cooling cycle that same day or immediately after the cooling system is started the next day.\n\nThe best approach to building-shutdown periods is to install positive dehumidification for outside air and leave that system on at low capacity during unoccupied hours, with heating\/cooling locked off unless required by outdoor conditions. This fits with variable-air-volume systems and can be tailored to the needs of a building over time.\n\nAs the public becomes more aware of IAQ issues, the positive, functional control of building humidity needs to be a specific, commissioned goal of projects. It needs to be stated clearly in the design-intent section of control specifications, followed through on in the basis-of-design portion, and field-tested. Assuming it will happen on its own is a mistake.\n\nEPA. (2002, October). Indoor air quality tools for schools program: Benefits of improving air quality in the school environment (EPA-402-K-02-005).

{"text":"From Virginia to Vermont, Air Pollution Unhealthy Today\n\nThe heat wave that has the East Coast sweating is threatening not only the skin of those brave enough to leave the comfort of air-conditioning, but also anyone who breathes.\n\nToday, from Virginia to New Hampshire, air quality is expected to be unhealthy, especially for those most sensitive to bad air.\n\nWith heat and sun comes ozone, an air pollutant whose potency has become better understood in recent years. Ozone, a main component of smog, forms when tailpipe and smokestack pollutions reacts to heat and sunlight. In the stratosphere, it protects us from harmful UV rays, but at the ground level it can scar lung tissue, trigger asthma attacks and, together with tiny particulate pollution, reach into the circulatory system and damage the heart.\n\n\"Ozone smog threatens the health of infants, children, seniors, and people who have asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and other lung diseases. For these people, breathing smog-polluted air can make them cough and wheeze, restrict their airways, worsen their diseases, force them to the hospital and even kill them,\" Bernadette Toomey, president and CEO of the American Lung Association said in March. \"Even healthy young adults and people who exercise or work outdoors can suffer from high levels of ozone pollution.\"\n\nThe rate of hospitalizations on hot days is higher, as is the rate of death, partially because of air pollution.\n\nOn hot summer days, health officials recommend limiting outdoor activity, particularly strenuous activity like exercise, to the early morning hours. Ozone builds up over time, and unhealthy conditions can linger even after the sun has gone down. But short-term and cumulative exposure are a concern.\n\nWhile the Environmental Protection Agency recently tightened the health standard governing allowable ozone in the air, health and environmental groups criticized it as too weak, based on the state of scientific understanding about ozone."}
{"text":"The leading hypothesis about how the particulates do harm relates to their ability to burrow deep into the lungs, says Edelman, spurring the release of inflammatory cytokines.

{"text":"Main menu\n\nCategory Archives: Health\n\nPost navigation\n\nForest fires can be more dangerous than you might think. Though the most immediate danger comes from the fire itself, the smoke from a fire can harm people up to hundreds of miles away from the actual blaze. During a forest fire, a number of harmful emissions are released into the air in high concentrations, including small particulate matter, such as carbon monoxide, atmospheric mercury, and volatile organic compounds. As these pollutants are released during a fire, winds can spread them further than one might expect, leaving people unprepared or unaware of the health hazards. Breathing in these pollutants can exacerbate symptoms for those who have lung or heart disease, and even otherwise healthy people can also be at risk for symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and headaches. The longer one is exposed to these pollutants, the higher these risks can be.\n\nWe can all do our part to stop wildfires before they start. When camping, make sure to never leave camp fires unattended and douse them fully with water when you are ready to put them out. During dry summer days, make sure to keep a close eye on barbeques, bonfires and even lawnmowers \u2013 they can create sparks that can ignite dry grass. When fires do occur, you can protect yourself by checking local air quality reports and staying inside when air quality dips. It is also advised not to do any indoor activity that will add to pollutant levels if possible. This includes using wood burning stoves, lighting candles, and even vacuuming, as vacuums can throw particles that have settled on surfaces back into the air. Using an air purifier is the best way to keep the indoor air clean, and if you live in a fire-prone area, consider adding an air purifier with a true HEPA filter before fire season starts so that you know you are protected even before pollutant levels begin to rise month, Rabbit Air joins with the rest of the nation in appreciation of the American Red Cross and all of the hard work that it does to help people in need.

Sharing tweets and Facebook updates from the Red Cross helps to raise awareness of their programs and donation needsIn December 2012, the University of California at San Diego discussed an exciting new advance in Air Quality monitoring. Researchers there had created a small portable device that measured air quality in real time, letting users know in the moment whether they were breathing clean air or if they had wandered into a spot of highly concentrated pollutants. This advanced technology allowed for those concerned with air quality to have more precise information about the environment around them, allowing them to make informed decisions about the air they breathed. Runners and bikers, for example, would be able to avoid areas with higher pollution, protecting their lungs as they exercised. The device could even be useful in indoor areas, as one study participant found when he realized that the air quality in his office was quite poor, prompting his company to take steps to improve the air for its employees.\n\nWe hope to see more research into this area, and look forward to the day when personal air quality monitoring is available to all. Until then, there are still steps one can take to be proactive about air quality and protected from pollutants. City-wide daily pollen and pollution counts are easily accessed on websites such as Pollen.com and AirNow.gov. These sites are great tools for learning about air pollution in your city, and can help to plan your outings during times when pollutant levels are low. When you're in your home, you can be smart about air pollutants as well by using a HEPA air purifier such as our MinusA2 to filter out harmful pollutants and keep the air clean and fresh holiday season is in full swing, and while we love this festive and fun time of year, we also know that colds and allergies can get worse during the winter months. Since no one wants to miss out on quality time with family and friends because of a stuffy nose, there are ways that you can keep smart about staying healthy during the winter months.\n\nHaving visitors for the holidays can be a merry treat, but friends and family bring more than just their luggage when they come to your home \u2013 they carry in germs and bacteria as well. Keep yourself from getting sick by washing your hands frequently and making sure that anyone with a cough or stuffy nose covers their mouth.\n\nIf you celebrate Christmas with a real pine tree, be wary of mold that may sneak in on the needles or bark, and make sure to dispose of any fallen needles right away. If you prefer an artificial tree to keep the pollen and mold at bay, remember to clean the tree frequently, as the needles provide a lot of surface area for dust to settle and collect.\n\nRain and snow are great when you're inside sipping on hot cocoa, but they also create a moist environment where mold loves to thrive. Keep humidity levels below 50%, and make sure to plug up any leaky windows or places where moisture can seep in. You may also want to add an air purifier, such as our MinusA2 with the Germ Defense Customized Filter, that can tackle any dust, mold, or germs that make it into the air. With an air purifier in the home you can worry less about airborne allergens and germs, and focus on the important things \u2013 the people you love!\n\nWe believe our MinusA2 air purifiers are the best in the business, but don't just take our word for it! Check out some bloggers who agree with us\u2026\n\nMommy Ramblings is written by Carolyn \u2013 a woman who truly knows the ins-and-outs of motherhood. A mother of five, Carolyn shares fun and touching stories about her family, offers great advice to others, and shares beautiful photographs from her home studio. Check out Mommy Rambling's review of our Artists Series MinusA2 air purifier with the beautiful Cherry Blossom design by clicking this link.\n\nSusan, from the blog Susan's Disney Family, also had the chance to try out our MinusA2. Susan and her family are big Disney fans, of course, but she also blogs about her life as a mother, her family's travels, and about her favorite products and giveaways. We were happy to hear that Susan's husband's allergy symptoms began to decrease after using our air purifier. Read her review right here!\n\nMarissa from The Review Stew is another blogging mamma who had the opportunity to try out one of our MinusA2s. As a mother of three who is also a fitness enthusiast, Marissa writes her blog to help other families learn about products that fit into a healthy and natural lifestyle. In her quest to help reduce her family's allergies, Marissa has tried many air purifiers, but considers our MinusA2 to be her favorite. Check out her review to see what else she has to say about Rabbit Air.\n\nWe want to thank Carolyn, Susan, and Marissa for their thoughtful and flattering reviews. We can't wait to see who will review Rabbit Air next!\n\nThe turning of the season is always a delight, and after spending the summer months at the mercy of the hot sun, the crisp, cool days of autumn may be a relief. Yet the change in the season also means that a new cycle of plants are starting to release their pollen, causing many people to get stuffy noses, itchy eyes, and other allergic reactions. Ragweed is the main culprit for fall allergies, though other plants that bloom at this time of year can contribute to allergic reactions. Mold also starts to become more of a problem during the fall as rainy weather and piles of fallen leaves can create the perfect damp and dark environment that it needs to thrive.\n\nWhile these allergens are in high concentration during this time of year, there are many things you can do to reduce your exposure to them. Dispose of that pile of freshly raked leaves promptly, and control your temptation to jump in, no matter how fun it might be. Wearing a face mask while you rake or do other yard work may also help to filter out any pollen or mold floating in the air. Keeping track of pollen counts is always a good idea no matter the season, and you can also help to reduce ragweed pollen around your home by carefully checking your garden and removing weeds wherever you find them. When you're finally relaxing inside with a hot cup of cider, make sure that you are breathing clean air by making the indoor environment inhospitable for mold growth. Keep humidity levels below 50%, and use an air purifier like our MinusA2 with the Germ Defense Customized Filter to trap any airborne mold inside your home. since"}
{"text":"All About Mold\n\nWhat is mold?\n\nSimply put, mold is a fungus. As mold grows, it produces spores and in some cases chemicals. Mold and mold spores are found everywhere in our environment. All, buildings and outside areas have background levels of mold spores. Mold will not grow unless it has moisture and a food source. Unfortunately, inside a home there are many food sources including dry wall, insulation, wood framing, etc. The only thing missing for indoor mold growth is moisture. Excess humidity, lack of ventilation, leaking pipes, flooding and a wide variety of other sources could provide a moisture source inside. If a moisture source goes for more than 24-48 hours unchecked, mold can start to grow.\n\nDo I have mold?\n\nOften times, mold is an obvious visible problem. In this case, it doesn't take a professional to figure out you have mold growing indoors. Other times, it isn't so obvious. Mold that is growing in living spaces is usually caught early and treated. Mold growth in spaces such as an attic, crawl space, basement, HVAC system, or inside the walls may not be easily detected and could be affecting your indoor air. Sometimes the only indication of mold growth is a musty smell, or known moisture intrusion that wasn't dried out within 48 hours. In these cases the best way to determine if mold is growing indoors is to take air samples and have them analyzed by microbiologists in a lab.\n\nAdditional help for determining if you have mold growing inside is available at the Air Quality Association or the US Environmental Protection Agnecy.\n\nWhy is mold a concern?\n\nAccording to studies published by Harvard University, approximately 40 to 50% of homes in North America have moisture and mold problems serious enough to impact respiratory symptoms in occupants . Those particularly at risk are pregnant women, infants, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions.\n\nIn 1999, the Mayo Clinic concluded that 96% of chronic sinusitis - sinus infections- were caused by fungi. Symptoms can include headaches, nose, eye and throat irritation and respiratory infections\n\nMold is an asthma trigger. Indoor mold has proven to increase the risk of children's asthma by 2.5 times.\n\nWith North Americans spending 90% of their time indoors, it is obvious why ensuring that you have the healthiest indoor air possible is critical to the health and welfare of you and your family.\n\nFinancial Concerns\n\nMold and fungal growth eats away at building materials and personal possessions. It can discolor walls, floors and ceilings. In severe cases, it can compromise the structural integrity of a building.\n\nRemediating costs to remove and repair mold problems can be prohibitive and are growing. Insurance has paid out $3 billion in mold related claims in 2002 and have paid out exponentially more in recent years. In most cases, insurance will only cover a certain amount for mold remediation and sometimes do not cover mold damage at all. This leaves property owners at risk when a mold problem arises.\n\nWhat can I do to prevent mold, or get rid of mold?\n\nThe best solution for mold is prevention. Prevent the moisture source and repair and dry moisture intrusion within 48 hours. If mold already exists, Mountain Air Indoors, Inc. has a state of the art process called bio-remediation that will decontaminate the entire structure while salvaging viable building materials and personal possessions."}
{"text":"Is It Safe Where Your Children Play?\n\nAn alarming trend has been observed. My name is Jason Moss and I am a certified and licensed radon measurement professional. I have the pleasure of meeting great people in my business and I love what I do \u2014 saving lungs and lives. I have observed a very disturbing trend in my profession.\n\nChildren are often placed in the most dangerous areas because of ignorance. Homes with basements typically have the play room for children and theater\/game room for young adults. Following EPA protocol, radon monitoring is to be conducted in the lowest livable area in the home. The simple reason for this requirement is that the lowest level is where the highest concentration of the cancer causing gas called radon is found.\n\nRadon is a colorless, tasteless, invisible gas produced as a byproduct of uranium decaying in the soil. One in four homes in Gwinnett, Barrow and Walton counties have tested with elevated radon levels. The EPA and Surgeon General recommend that EVERY home be tested for the presences of radon.\n\nDo it your-self home test kits are available but it is advised to have a certified professional complete this test with electronic continuous monitors for the most accurate results. Your family's health is far too important to take chances. Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in America for non-smokers. Over 22,000 people in America will die this year as a result of radon exposure. If radon is found in your home it can be fixed in most cases for less than other normal household repairs. The only way to know if your child's play room and your home is at a safe level is to have it tested.\n\nHigh Levels of Radon Recently Found in Hamilton Mill, Chateau Elan and Surrounding Areas.\n\nOver the past week, homes in Hamilton Mill and Chateau Elan were professionally tested for radon and many were found to have dangerously high levels. The only way to know if your home is a healthy environment for your family is to have it professionally tested.\n\nThe EPA, Surgeon General and American Cancer Society recommend that EVERY home be tested for radon. If elevated levels are found, it is simple to fix and costs less than most other home repairs.\n\nThe EPA also recommends that you have your home tested every two years if you have a mitigation system installed."}

Tribes Appeal Tighter Restrictions on Power Plant Emissions\n\nICTMN Staff\n\nMay 26, 2011\n\nNavajo Generating Station in Page, Arizona\n\n\"Coal: it's the safest energy there is.\"\n\nSo reads the slogan for a parody web site aimed at Peabody Energy, which operates Arizona's coal-mining company, the Kayenta Mine, on Navajo and Hopi lands. The satirical site ( launched in early May by the organization Coal Kills Kids, appears to offer free \"Puff-Puff\" inhalers to families who live within 200 miles of a coal plant, reported the Los Angeles Times, along with coupons worth $10 toward the purchase of asthma medication. There's even a F.A.Q. and Media page, plus fun games in the \"Kidz Koal Korner.\"\n\nBut the parody conceals a major health dilemma, with millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs at stake.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently considering whether to require the plant's operators, the Salt River Project (SRP), to spend $1.1 billion on scrubbers to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and clear the smog cloud hovering above northern Arizona, reported the Navajo Times. SRP has threatened a shutdown if the EPA forces such action.\n\nThat's bad news for SRP's allies\u2014the Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribe and Gila River Indian Community. At an EPA hearing on May 24, tribal leaders testified that closing the coal-fired power plant would cripple their communities, eliminate 1,000 jobs and threaten water rights settlements, reported the Associated Press. The Navajo Generating Station and the Kayenta Mine provide about $140 million in revenue and wages to the Navajo Nation; The Hopi Tribe gets $13 million for its coal and water.\n\nBut according to Navajo environmental groups\u2014the Din\u00e9 Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment, the Black Mesa Water Coalition and To Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed (Beautiful Water Speaks)\u2014heavy pollution from the plant causes high rates of asthma and respiratory infections in the area. \"Among all industrial sources of air pollution, none poses greater risks to human health and the environment than coal-fired power plants,\" concluded a September 2010 report by the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force, reported Wired magazine.\n\nSince 2008, Peabody has spent about $6.9 million on lobbying, much of it against pollution reform, Wired said.\n\nThe EPA is expected to release its proposal on pollution controls this summer and implement a rule next year. Controls would be effective for five years; the SRP wants to continue running the Navajo Generating Station until the year 2044.\n\n\"The EPA estimated last year that the Clean Air Act\u2014and this is fundamentally what we're talking about\u2014had saved 160,000 lives,\" Janice Nolen, a policy expert at the American Lung Association, told Wired magazine. \"We've seen this law work to save lives. We have an opportunity now to continue that.\"\n\nWith bitter irony, Coal Kills Kids is cointuing to rail against the health hazards caused by coal plant emissions.\n\n\"Some environmentalists have suggested that coal companies should install an untested technology called 'scrubbers' atop coal plants to make them burn more cleanly, reducing coal particulate exposure as one cause of childhood asthma,\" reads their mock site. \"For our part, Peabody has decided that reducing Asthma-Related Bullying (ARB) is the single most effective way to combat public misperceptions of our industry.\""}
{"text":"Air Quality\n\nHealth Problems\n\nThe quality of the air in your home can affect your family's comfort and health.\nThe temperature and humidity should be controlled. Air should be clean and free of harmful\nchemicals and smoke. Poor air quality can cause a stuffy nose, sore throat, burning eyes,\nheadache, and sleepiness. People who have asthma, allergies or lung disease are affected\nmore than others.\n\nCarbon monoxide from faulty home heating systems cause about 200 deaths a year in the\nUnited States. Carbon monoxide can also come from using portable\ngenerators inappropriately. If you can not vent the exhaust\nfrom your portable generator safely, do not use it!\n\nTips on Smoke and Carbon Monoxide:\n\nBan tobacco smoke from your home.\n\nInstall a carbon monoxide detector near bedrooms.\n\nInspect your gas appliances and chimney every year. Replace furnace filters every month\nor two during periods of use. Make sure your gas dryer, furnace and water heater are\nvented to the outdoors.\n\nMold and Mildew\n\nMolds and mildew grow in damp, dark places. Molds and mildew can cause lung problems\n\u2013 especially in people who have allergies or asthma. You can prevent the growth of\nmolds and mildew in your home by controlling humidity.\n\nTips on Mold and Mildew:\n\nControl moisture. Use a dehumidifier during the summer. Use an\nexhaust fan in the kitchen and bathroom. Vent the clothes dryer to the outdoors and make\nsure the vent pipe is not clogged.\n\nChemicals\n\nChemicals can enter the air in your home when you paint, use cleaning solvents, install\npressed wood, install new carpets and use new fabrics. These chemicals can irritate your\neyes, throat, and nose. High levels can give you a headache or make you feel dizzy.\n\nTips on Chemicals:\n\nMake sure your home has lots of fresh air.\n\nUse safe paints, cleaners and other products. Look for those with the fewest warnings.\n\nRead labels. Some chemicals should only be used in well-vented spaces. The label may\ntell you if the chemicals can cause cancer or other health problems.\n\nRadon\n\nRadon is a colorless, odorless, soil gas that can seep into your home through cracks in\nconcrete. Radon related lung-cancer causes thousands of deaths in the U.S. each year. Only\nsmoking causes more. All homes should be tested.\n\nTips on Radon:\n\nTest your home. Many hardware stores sell low-cost test kits. Your local health\ndepartment may also have test kits. Make sure the kit has the words, \"Meets EPA\nRequirements\" on the package. Test the air of the lowest floor of your home that is\nlived in. If the radon level is less than 4 picocuries per liter, no action is needed.\n\nIf the level is above 4, repeat the test (or do a year-long test) to find the average\nlevel in your home.\n\nCorrect the problem if the second reading is also above 4. Call the Radon Information\nCenter at 1-888-LOW RADON or contact your local public health department for more\ninformation.\n\nAsbestos\n\nAsbestos is used in heating insulation, pipe wrap, floor tiles, slate siding, slate\nshingles, and ceiling tiles. Asbestos is harmful when it is damaged and fibers enter the\nair. Breathing air that contains asbestos fibers over several years can increase your risk\nof lung cancer.\n\nTips on Asbestos:\n\nIf you think you may have asbestos in your home, contact a certified\nasbestos inspector to find out what actions are needed.\n\nDon't try to remove asbestos by yourself. Only trained\nprofessionals should do this work.\n\nAsthma\n\nAsthma is an illness that causes wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and\ncoughing. More than 6,000 young people visit the emergency department for\nasthma treatment every year in Wisconsin. Pets, molds, pollen, and cockroaches can trigger asthma. Smoke, chemicals, ozone,\nand exhaust fumes can also trigger asthma. More information on asthma\nin Wisconsin and the Wisconsin\nAsthma Program at the Department of Health Services can be\nfound at the asthma\nwebsite.\n\nTips for People with Asthma:\n\nIf a person with asthma is allergic to cats or dogs, the family pet may need to be\nremoved from the home. At least keep pets out of the person's bedroom.\n\nConsider adding a high efficiency air filter to your heating system.\n\nControl humidity. Keep the humidity below 50% and fix moisture problems. This will\nreduce dust mites,\nmolds and mildew.\n\nGet rid of cockroaches by carefully cleaning (especially in the kitchen) and removing\ntrash every day. Use pesticides as a last resort.\n\nDamp mop, damp dust, and vacuum often. Use mattress and pillow covers. Remove carpets,\ndrapes, books, stuffed animals, and feather or down pillows and covers from the bedroom.\nWash bedding once a week using hot water to kill dust mites."}
{"text":"Toxic Air Pollutants (TAPs)\n\nToxic air pollutants (TAPs) are those pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or to cause adverse environmental effects.\n\nAir toxics are regulated by both state and federal programs. Idaho's Air Toxics Program regulates approximately 350 toxic air pollutants (TAPs), while EPA's federal program regulates 188 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). Both TAPs and HAPs are referred to as air toxics.\n\nIdaho's TAP program preceded the federal program. Some areas overlap in the state and federal programs.\n\nIdaho's TAP Program\n\nIdaho's TAP Program is a stand-alone risk-based program that regulates approximately 350 pollutants determined by their nature to be toxic to human or animal life or vegetation. Idaho's regulations prohibit emission of these contaminants alone or in combination with other contaminants in amounts that would injure or unreasonably affect human or animal life or vegetation.\n\nTAP emission limits from industrial sources are limited by acceptable ambient concentrations (AACs) for carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic pollutants and by screening emission levels (ELs) for non-carcinogens.\n\nAACs are the maximum concentration levels allowed in the outside air from a pollution source or sources under construction or modification. Compliance is often verified by computer modeling or ambient air sampling. AACs for non-carcinogens are 24-hour averages. These levels can be found in IDAPA 58.01.01.585. Acceptable ambient concentrations for carcinogens (AACCs) are annual averages. These levels can be found in IDAPA 58.01.01.586.\n\nELs are stack-based emission levels based on pounds of each pollutant emitted per hour. Compliance is often verified by engineering calculations, computer modeling, or stack sampling. Emission levels for non-carcinogens can be found in IDAPA 58.01.01.585, while emission levels for carcinogens can be found in IDAPA 58.01.01.586.\n\nRelationship to the Federal HAP Program\n\nIf a new or modified source emits an air toxic that is regulated by both Idaho's program and EPA's HAP program, then the source is exempt from the state program for the specific pollutant regulated by the federal standard. If the source emits additional TAPs not covered under the applicable federal standard, then the source is subject to the state regulations for those pollutants. Learn more.\n\nChemical accidents can occur at businesses of any size. Many small businesses handle ammonia, chlorine, and other chemicals that could pose a risk to the surrounding community if an accident were to occur. Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments prescribes a series of requirements aimed at preventing and minimizing the consequences of chemical accidental releases. Learn more.\n\nNational-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA)\n\nThe NATA is an ongoing comprehensive evaluation by EPA of air toxics in the U.S. It is designed to help EPA, state, local, and tribal governments, and the public better understand the extent of the air toxics problem in the U.S. and to help focus future efforts to reduce air toxics and associated health impacts. The assessment includes four steps:\n\nInventory air toxics emissions.\n\nEstimate annual average outdoor air toxics concentrations.\n\nEstimate exposure concentrations (what people are estimated to breathe).\n\nCharacterize potential public health risks.\n\nInformation gained by the NATA will help EPA accomplish the following:\n\nIdentify air toxics of greatest potential concern.\n\nCharacterize the relative contributions to air toxics concentrations and population exposures of different types of air toxics emissions sources.\n\nSet priorities for the collection of additional air toxics data to improve estimates of air toxics concentrations and their potential public health impacts. Important additional data collection activities include upgraded emission inventory information, ambient air toxics monitoring, and information on adverse effects to health and the environment.\n\nEstablish a baseline to track trends over time in modeled ambient concentrations of air toxics.\n\nEPA has released two phases of the NATA, which evaluated 32 high priority TAPs. The first phase includes estimated air toxics emissions and outdoor air concentrations. The second phase provides estimates of human exposure to these pollutants and associated health risks. The NATA will help DEQ target areas of the state where more detailed information and air toxics reduction strategies are needed.\n\nEPA's Urban Air Toxics Program\n\nUnder EPA's Urban Air Toxics Program, states will be required to assess local air quality data to identify urban areas where air toxics emissions need to be reduced. States also must devise a process for developing and implementing strategies to reduce health risks from air toxics, provide an opportunity for public participation and review, and develop tools to evaluate whether emissions have been reduced.\n\nThe Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy\n\nThe Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy is a framework for addressing air toxics emissions in urban areas. The strategy defines a county as \"urban\" if it includes a metropolitan statistical area with a population greater than 250,000 or the U.S. Census Bureau has designated more than 50% of the population as \"urban.\" (Note: This definition does not necessarily apply for regulatory or implementation purposes.)\n\nUnder the national air toxics program, EPA has and will continue to develop a number of national standards for stationary and mobile sources to improve air quality in urban and rural areas. The strategy complements these efforts by focusing on achieving even further reductions in air toxics emissions in urban areas. The strategy outlines actions to reduce emissions of air toxics, as well as assessment activities to improve EPA's understanding of the health and environmental risks of air toxics in urban areas.\n\nThe strategy includes a list of 33 urban air toxics that pose the greatest potential health threat in urban areas and a list of area sources responsible for a substantial portion of these air toxics emissions. This list includes 29 area source categories, 13 of which are new and 16 are under development or already subject to standards."}

Peak levels can stay in the blood for up to an hour.\n\nTheir findings prompt the authors to suggest that preventive measures should be based on average hourly measures rather than just average daily measures alone"}
{"text":"Air Pollution May Raise Autism Risk\n\nNov. 26, 2012 -- Being exposed to high levels of air pollution from traffic may raise the risk of autism, researchers say.\n\n\"Children exposed to higher levels of traffic-related pollutants during pregnancy or during the first year of life were at increased risk of autism compared to children exposed to the lowest level,\" says Heather E. Volk, PhD, MPH, assistant professor of research at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine.\n\nThe risk differed depending on timing.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the highest exposures to pollution were linked with a two-times-higher risk of autism, she says. High levels during the child's first year tripled the risk.\n\nThe study is published online in the Archives of General Psychiatry.\n\nAir Pollution & Autism Risk\n\nAutism is a diverse disorder marked by problems in communicating and interacting socially. It now affects about 1 in 88 children in the U.S.\n\nResearchers have been looking at the potential role of air pollution in autism only for about three years, Volk says.\n\nAir pollution has been linked with a variety of ill health outcomes, she says, including babies being born small for their gestational age. \"When you think about the birth outcome literature, looking at air pollution [and autism risk] makes some sense,\" she says.\n\nIn 2011, Volk's team reported a higher risk of autism for children whose families lived within about 1,000 feet of a freeway.\n\nFor the new study, she looked at data from 279 children with autism and a comparison group of 245 children without it.\n\nAt the time they started, the children were ages 2 to 5 years.\n\nVolk used the mothers' addresses to estimate exposure to pollution during each trimester of pregnancy and during the child's first year of life.\n\nThey used information from the EPA and did traffic modeling to figure out how much traffic-related air pollution was at each location. They also looked at exposure to particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide.\n\nIn her previous study, Volk says, she just looked at how far people lived from roads. The new study went further.\n\n\"Now we consider how busy the road was, traffic density, volume of traffic, and how often the road is traveled,\" she says.\n\nThe risk of autism was higher for those exposed to more pollution, either before birth or during their first year.\n\nBased on the findings, however, Volk says she can't say that living in a specific area is worse than another.\n\nFor instance, those who live in a rural area might be close to a very busy high-traffic intersection, increasing pollution exposure.\n\nShe found a link or association. It does not prove cause and effect.\n\nThe link held after she considered other factors that affect risk, such as prenatal smoking, the mother's age, race, and ethnicity."}
{"text":"Smoke & asthma\n\nFor as long as Jami Hinshaw can remember, she has coughed,\nsneezed, sniffled, and felt miserable every September. When she was\nnine, the Spokane native and WSU alum was diagnosed with\nasthma.\n\nLast fall, Hinshaw was fighting her usual symptoms, but she was\nalso carrying a portable air quality monitor in a backpack as part\nof a study to better understand the health effects of agricultural\nfield burning. Researchers from Washington State University are\nworking with their counterparts from the School of Public Health at\nthe University of Washington to examine volunteers' exposure levels\nto atmospheric pollutants coming from field burning in the\nregion.\n\nControversy has swirled in recent years around the practice of\nfield burning. A lawsuit was settled in 2001 that charged the state\nof Washington with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by\nissuing wheat-burning permits to farmers. The state of Idaho is\nalso being sued because of health concerns arising from\nagricultural field burning practices.\n\nWith the help of funding from the Environmental Protection\nAgency and the Washington State Department of Ecology, researchers\nin WSU's Laboratory of Atmospheric Research gave air quality\nmonitors last fall to asthmatic volunteers to carry throughout the\nday. They also placed monitors in the volunteers' homes to measure\ntheir exposure levels to particulate matter in the air during the\nfield-burning season. At the same time, the volunteers' asthmatic\nsymptoms were carefully monitored over an eight-week period.\n\nThe study also looked at the chemical composition of the smoke\nto better understand just what might make people sick.\n\nInformation from the data could eventually be used to set\nstandards for particulate matter that better reflect its health\neffects. While the Environmental Protection Agency set standards\nregulating small particulate matter in the mid-1990s, the exact\nmechanism of how the tiny particles affect health is not well\nunderstood.\n\n\"There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that links health effects\nto the presence of smoke in the air,\" says Candis Claiborn,\nassociate professor of civil and environmental engineering. \"But\nit's been difficult to assemble enough hard data to find a\nstatistically significant association.\n\n\"We want to know more about people's exposure to agricultural\nfield burning. We also want to know if exposure to this smoke\naffects asthmatic adults. We hope the study results will help us\nbetter understand smoke exposure risks and reduce future health\nrisks.\"\n\nBecause this is the first study of its kind, the work will most\nlikely result in more study, said Claiborn.

For instance, if the\nresearchers find that air quality causes the most health problems\nduring the night hours, perhaps guidelines could eventually call\nfor burning earlier in the day, allowing the smoke to dissipate\nbefore nightfall.\n\n\"I think that eventually they will be able to manage smoke, so\nthat farmers will be able to burn, and people won't be affected,\"\nsays Claiborn.\n\nFor her part, Hinshaw enjoyed participating in the study and\ndidn't mind carrying around her specialized pack, in spite of\ncurious looks from friends and co-workers.\n\n\"I thought it was much lighter than the bags I used to carry\naround as an undergrad,\" she says."}
{"text":"The Silent Killer\n\nDuring a recent summer, a family of three happily set out on a trip, taking with them their thirteen-foot camping trailer. When they reached their destination, they set up camp and, at the conclusion of the day, went to bed in the trailer. Because of the cold mountain air they left a coal brazier burning while they slept. This was a serious mistake.\n\nAlthough they had opened a roof vent and a louvered window for ventilation, carbon monoxide gas accumulated. When the mother awoke early in the morning she felt nauseated and exhausted. She went to awaken her twelve-year-old daughter, but was shocked to find the child dead. Carbon monoxide, the silent killer, had been at work. It had nearly killed the father and mother as well. Both had to be hospitalized.\n\nToo many people fail to realize that smoldering charcoal can kill even in a ventilated room. Because they cannot smell or see this gas, they fail to be alert to a dangerous situation. A similar peril exists in automobiles.\n\nIt is not uncommon to read news reports about people found dead in parked cars, killed by carbon monoxide from their automobile engines. Some had died in airport parking lots where they were keeping warm by running the engine of the car while waiting for someone. This story has also been repeated at drive-in movies when the car's motor was used for heating the car.\n\nCarbon monoxide gas is formed by the burning of any substance that contains carbon. The gasoline used to run automobiles, the fuel used for heating homes and even the tobacco in cigars and cigarettes give off carbon monoxide when burned. Ample ventilation is essential.\n\nAccording to a report made by a panel of the U.S. Public Health Service under the leadership of Dr. Daniel Horn, there are surprisingly high carbon monoxide levels in rooms filled with tobacco smoke. Thus smokers damage not only their own health but that of others.\n\nWhen a person breathes in carbon monoxide gas, the ability of the blood to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues of the body is seriously impaired. The hemoglobin in the blood has an attraction that is a hundred times greater for carbon monoxide than for oxygen. As a result, the tissues of the body become starved for oxygen. The body experiences a loss of energy and a crippling of mental and physical reactions.\n\nCarbon monoxide is said to become dangerous when it reaches a level of ten parts per million parts of air, a level that is not unusual in congested city traffic. At this concentration harm can be done to a pregnant woman and persons suffering from bronchitis, emphysema and chronic heart disease. Since a damaged heart may not be able to make compensation for a reduced oxygen supply in the blood, death can result. A mixture of 600 parts of carbon monoxide per million of air, such as can easily accumulate in a camping trailer with a coal brazier, can kill in the space of three hours.\n\nAlthough coal braziers, automobiles and stoves are commonplace and perform services for man, it should never be forgotten that they also harbor a deadly killer. It is vital to be aware of the danger and to take precautions."}

The report finds that EPA supports its conclusions that formaldehyde can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat; lesions in the respiratory tract; and genetic mutations at high concentrations. Furthermore, the report finds that the evidence is sufficient for EPA to conclude that formaldehyde exposures are a cause of cancers of the nose, nasal cavity, and upper throat. However, the draft assessment has not adequately supported its conclusions that formaldehyde causes other cancers of the respiratory tract, leukemia, or several other noncancer health outcomes.

While replacing 2005's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), the CSAPR mainly requires 28 states to diminish power plant emissions, which have been proven to generate harmful pollution levels in other states throughout the country.\n\nAccording to the EPA's recent estimates, the CSAPR is believed to offer the American public a variety of benefits in the near future; in 2014, the rule will likely reduce acute bronchitis cases by 19,000, hospital visits by 19,000 and premature mortality cases by roughly 13,000 to 34,000.\n\nIn 2014, the rule will lead to approximately $120 to $280 billion in health and environmental benefits, while only costing $800 million. The EPA estimates that the CSAPR will improve air quality for more than 240 million Americans in various regions of the U.S.\n\nAs Americans anticipate the future benefits that may be noticed as a result of the CSAPR, one final statistic \u2013 the reduction of power plant SO2 emissions by 73 percent and NOx emissions by 54 percent in 2014, compared to 2005 levels \u2013 also cannot be ignored.\n\nAt the same time, the EPA's proposed Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for nationwide power plants has recently been fully developed. The standards are expected to decrease power plants' mercury and acid gas pollution emissions throughout the coming years; such reductions are expected to prevent thousands of American illnesses, while also reducing premature deaths by roughly 17,000 annually.\n\nBy decreasing air pollutant emissions from oil- and coal-fired power plants, the EPA believes national health costs will be reduced by $59 billion to $140 billion in 2016 alone. The EPA accepted public comments regarding MATS until Aug. 4, 2011; MATS have yet to be approved by Congress.\n\nAs American power plant owners and employees prepare for the future, they may be interested in receiving answers to two questions \u2013 and soon.\n\nFirst, will these rules and standards ever actually become regulations?

His team created a computer model of just such a basic street canyon \u2013 taking into variables such as wind speed and vegetation coverage \u2013 focused air pollutants nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter measuring less than 10 micrometers (0.0004 inches) in diameter.\n\nBoth of these are known to be commonplace in cities world-wide, and linked to heart and lung diseases. The findings were that, at low wind speeds, just the simple addition of shrubbery to walls cut nitrogen dioxide concentrations by 40% and particulate matter by 60%. This should mean, the researchers say, that if very high pollution levels apply to particular streets, they can be targeted for greening and thus rendered healthier.\n\nThe new findings challenge traditional thinking, which has long held that greenery could only remove small amounts of air pollutants, when the true potential in using greenery might actually be much more effective, giving planners another tool to fight urban air pollution, known to be today world-wide a major cause of illness and premature death in cities around the world.\n\nUrban plantings come along with several other bonus features, including reducing both the so-called urban heat island effect and noise pollution, as well as providing habitats for birds and wildlife, and making the whole street outlook a more pleasant experience all-round."}
{"text":"LOS ANGELES \u2013 Diesel emissions from the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports are increasing cancer risks miles inland, according to a new study.\n\nThe study by the California Air Resources Board concluded air pollution from the ports creates a possible risk of 50 additional cancer cases per 1 million people within 15 miles of the ports. About 2 million people live in the area.\n\nFor the 53,000 residents closest to the ports, the risk leaps to 500 cases per 1 million people, according to a draft of the study, which is the first thorough examination of the cancer risk from diesel fumes generated at the ports.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any other assessment on emissions and risks from the ports that have been done in so much detail,\" said Jean Ospital, health effects officer at the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the area's air quality regulator.\n\nOspital said it's surprising that port pollution seeps so far inland.\n\nThe draft version of the study was done to help the air board as it reviews proposed rules for limiting ship and cargo equipment pollution. Both ports have launched emission reduction programs.\n\nThe study concluded that the two ports emitted 1,760 tons of diesel pollution in 2002. Researchers compared that figure to air dispersion models and the standard cancer potency of diesel to come up with the increased risk assessment for the area surrounding the ports.\n\n\"What they're essentially saying is this is the estimate of risk based on a person being exposed to that amount of pollution for their entire life,\" said Dr. Dean Baker, director of the Center for Occupational and Environmental Health and professor of medicine at UC Irvine.\n\nAbout 250,000 in 1 million Californians will get cancer from any cause, studies have shown.\n\nThe main risk from diesel emissions is lung cancer, which is usually fatal, said Jerry Martin, an Air Resources Board spokesman.\n\nDiesel pollution from the ports also causes 29 premature deaths of people ages 30 and older, 750 asthma attacks, 6,600 lost workdays, according to the study.\n\nActivity at the two ports is expected to triple by 2020. ]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>]>"}

{"text":"Particulate matter consists of solid particles, fine liquid droplets, or condensed liquids adsorbed onto solid particles. Particulate with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers in diameter is referred to as PM 10 while very fine particles equal to or less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter is referred to as PM 2.5.\n\nParticulate emissions are primarily composed of smoke, dust, dirt, soot, fly ash, and condensing vapors. The particles or droplets are composed of different elements depending on the emission source. Chemical reactions can occur in the atmosphere and form new chemical compounds or change the form from gases and liquids into solid particles. Industrial processes that cause these emissions include combustion, incineration, construction, mining, metal smelting, metal processing, and grinding. Non-industrial sources include motor vehicle exhaust, road dust, wind-blown soil, forest fires, volcanic activity, and farm operations.\n\nPM 10 Annual average PM 10 levels over the decade have remained at nearly one-half of the standard. Michigan has been designated as being in attainment with the PM 10 particulate National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) since October 4, 1996.\n\nPM 2.5 NAAQS The EPA established a new standard for very fine particles (2.5 micrometers or less), which are a particular concern for lung and cardiovascular effects. Annual arithmetic mean not to exceed 15 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g\/m3) (based on a three-year average); or 98th percentile of 24-hour concentration not to exceed 35 \u00b5g\/m3 (based on a three-year average). Under the Clean Air Act, those areas that violate the NAAQS, or are nearby and contribute to a violation, are considered \"nonattainment.\"\n\nPM 2.5 In 2006, the EPA maintained the annual standard at 15 \u00b5g\/m3 and revised the NAAQS PM 2.5 24 hour by reducing it to 35 \u00b5g\/m3. The EPA designated seven counties in the Detroit-Ann Arbor Metropolitan Statistical Area (Southeast Michigan) as nonattainment for the annual and 24 hour PM 2.5 NAAQS: Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw and Wayne counties. Air quality monitoring data collected in the 2007 - 2010 period showed all seven counties in Southeast Michigan in attainment for the PM 2.5 annual and daily NAAQS.\n\nHealth Effects Particulate matter can affect breathing and the defenses of the lungs, and aggravates existing respiratory and heart disease. More serious effects may occur depending on the length of exposure, the concentration, and the chemical nature of the particulate matter. Asthmatics and individuals with chronic lung and\/or heart disease, people with influenza, the elderly, and children are the most susceptible. Fine particulate is especially problematic, because it can penetrate deep into the lungs and remain there.\n\nVisibility Effects Particulate matter is the major cause of reduced visibility in many parts of the U.S. PM 2.5 is considered to be an important visibility-reducing component of urban and regional haze. Airborne particles can also impact vegetation and ecosystems and can cause damage to paints, building materials and\/or surfaces. Deposition of acid aerosols and salts may increase corrosion of metals and impact plant tissue by corroding leaf surfaces and interfering with plant metabolism.\n\nOther Resources or more information about particulate matter or older files, please contact Robert Irvine at 517-373-7042."}
{"text":"Riding in cars with smokers\n\nAug 29, 2007 spouse and kids to particulates at a level well above government safety standards. That's the bottom-line finding of measurements recently published by engineering researchers at Stanford University.\n\n\"This is the most comprehensive set of measurements ever made of vehicle air change rates and smoke particulate levels in real driving conditions,\" says Neil Klepeis, a consulting professor of civil and environmental engineering (CEE) at Stanford. Klepeis co-authored the study published online July 18 in the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology. \"Conditions in a car with a smoker can vary widely, but in some situations we can confirm that passengers will receive an exposure to secondhand smoke that is considered unhealthful.\"\n\nCo-author Wayne Ott, also a CEE consulting professor who worked for decades as a scientist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), noted that legislation banning smoking in cars with children present passed in Arkansas last year and has been considered in seven other states.\n\n\"Our hope is that this research can lend rigorously acquired and analyzed, objective scientific information to this debate,\" Ott says.\n\nKlepeis and Ott collaborated with Stanford statistics and earth sciences Professor Paul Switzer on the paper, which followed an article the team published in June on secondhand smoke exposure in outdoor caf\u00e9 settings. That paper, the first of its kind, almost immediately began to be cited in policy debates about regulating outdoor smoking, Ott says.\n\nMeasuring particles\n\nIn both the caf\u00e9 and the car studies, the team sought to measure smoke particles of less than 0.0001 inch (2.5 millionths of a meter) in diameter. These particles are deemed a health risk by the EPA because they can penetrate deep into lung tissue when inhaled. The level the EPA considers unhealthy is 35 millionths of a gram per cubic meter (35 \u00b5g\/m3), averaged over 24 hours.\n\nTo make air exchange and secondhand smoke measurements in four different cars, the team released a tracer gas or engaged volunteer smokers to puff as they drove. While taking the measurements, the engineers kept track of a number of independent variables including whether the fan or air conditioning was off or on, the car's speed and whether the windows were open or closed.\n\nAccounting for all of these parameters allowed the engineers to calculate the air change rate, or the number of times per hour that the air in the car cabin flows out and is replaced by fresh air. It is the air changes per hour (ACH) that determines the concentration of particulates in the vehicle's air, Ott says, but it has never before been systematically studied on such a large scale. More than 100 air change rate measurements were made at different speeds, vent settings, air conditioner settings and window positions.\n\nTo understand how conditions affect the exposure of passengers to secondhand smoke particles, consider three measurements made in a 2005 Ford Taurus under different conditions while driving at 60 miles an hour. With the front passenger window cracked open 3 inches and no air conditioning on, the particulate concentration reached a maximum of only 608 \u00b5g\/m3 while a cigarette was smoking. With the windows shut and regular (non-recirculating) air conditioning on, the maximum concentration rose to 1,394 \u00b5g\/m3. With the windows closed and the air conditioner on maximum (recirculating air), the peak concentration hit 3,808 \u00b5g\/m3.\n\nFrom their data, Ott and Klepeis have calculated that in a car with the windows up and the air conditioning on maximum, a passenger would be exposed to such a high particle concentration that his or her exposure averaged over 24 hours would be 21 \u00b5g\/m3 per cigarette. After just two cigarettes, the exposure of a passenger would exceed the 35 \u00b5g\/m3 EPA cutoff by 20 percent.\n\n\"In other words, being in the car with a smoker under these conditions gives such a huge amount of particulates that you'll exceed what would be considered a safe level of exposure,\" Klepeis says. \"If more people become aware that smoking in their car could lead to harmful toxic exposures for their family and friends, they may decide to ban smoking in their cars\u2014at least while others are present.\"\n\nOtt adds that even with a car's windows open, smoke particle concentrations were higher than the levels he measured in California bars during studies in the mid-1990s before the state banned smoking in tavernsens of thousands of Americans die each year from secondhand tobacco smoke, according to a 2006 report by the U.S. Surgeon General.

{"text":"Roomba indoor air quality mapping\n\nThe revisions let you track differences between multiple versions of a post.\n\nThe RISD Environmental Justice Research Cluster in Providence uses a Roomba as a medium in order to reveal the condition of our surroundings. Roomba--the room cleaning vacuum--is programmed to travel all around a room once it is left to roam. Therefore, it is an ideal tool to assess the quality of air through out a room. We have attached a sensor and light system to these second hand Roombas. When our Roomba senses a change in air quality, currently an increase in the amount of volatile organic chemicals (VOC) in the air (we use alcohol as our test VOC) it emits a different color of light. If you take a long exposure image of our Roomba as it travels through a room, you can see the path its traveled by the light it emits. In areas where there are more VOCs the light on Roomba changes from green to blue. Looking at this image you can easily spot an area of indoor air-pollution. In the future we will be adding a sensor for formaldehyde to this Roomba. Formaldehyde is a very common indoor and harmful indoor air-pollutant.\n\nCurrently, we use MQ 135, an air quality sensor to express the condition of air. In the future, we can also use the wireless system or hack a roomba to control its movement as the quality of air.\n\n50 \u2013 500 ppm: Respiratory tract and eye irritation.

{"text":"Air Pollution Exceeds International Health Standards for European Urbanites deadly air within the EU is found in the eastern countries of Bulgaria and Romania, but there are few urban areas that escape unhealthy pollutants like ozone, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. The published study is already being seized upon by environmental groups who demand much tougher EU standards.\n\nThe primary sources of urban air pollution in Europe is transport, energy, and agriculture. The executive director of the EEA, Jacqueline McGlade, blamed economic inefficiencies as well as the failure of many EU countries to meet their binding commitment of pollution reduction.\n\nThe report shows that almost one third of city dwellers were exposed to excessive levels of airborne particulate matter. Approximately 17 percent were also exposed to high levels of ozone, the pollutant responsible for producing smog. The report also shows seven percent of urbanites exposed to nitrogen dioxide above the EU recommended level.\n\nThe poor air quality in European cities can cause widespread effects on human and ecological health. There are some studies which claim that nearly 500,000 premature deaths are caused by breathing unhealthy air. The air pollution also damages plants and contributes to corrosion of buildings.\n\nThe EEA estimates the price tag for poor air quality at \u20ac630 ($815) billion for health care costs and an additional \u20ac169 ($218) billion in lost productivity.\n\nThe report shows that there is still work to do with some pollutants. However, it highlights the success of air quality regulations with certain pollutants such as sulfur oxides (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO).\n\nLevels of SO2, one of the more pernicious pollutants for human and environmental health, has been cut by 82 percent since 1990 thanks to the adoption of more efficient control technologies such as scrubbers.\n\nWhile all pollutants have been cut in some way, poor ambient air quality still remains in the EU urban centers. This has led for environmental and health advocacy groups to call for stricter guidelines for air pollution to make the EU standards sync with World Health Organization standards"}
{"text":"The most important anthropogenic sources of nitrogen oxides are combustion processes. Nitrogen oxides can be formed in combustion processes from the nitrogen contained in the fuel or from the nitrogen that is part of the air.\n\nIn most of the external fossil fuel combustion systems, around 95% of the nitrogen oxides emitted are in the form of nitrogen monoxide (NO), whereas the remaining 5% is in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2).\n\nThe NO emitted oxidizes further in the atmosphere to NO2. The term NOX refers to the sum of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), expressed as NO2.\n\nNO2 is a highly reactive gas whose color gives the peculiar tone of reddish-brown to photochemical smog. Also, these oxides react with water to produce nitric acid (HNO3), which, together with sulfuric acid, results in acid rain.\n\nAnother harmful effect of nitrogen oxides is the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen as nitrates and nitrites derived from NOX, which leads to eutrophication of inland waters and coastal seas [46\u201348]."}

In many cases people develop this problem due to being overweight or obese, but a new study has found exposure to pesticides in their food and the air could also be to blame.\n\nScientists from the University of Granada came to this conclusion after analyzing the concentrations of a specific group of Persistent Organic Pollutants (CPOs) in the adipose (fat) tissue of 386 participants. Researchers discovered patients with higher levels of CPOs were four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in comparison to their counterparts who were exposed to fewer pesticides. These results held true regardless of patients' age, gender or body mass index. Despite the surprising finding, more research needs to be conducted to figure out the link between pesticides and diabetes.\n\nSince some pesticides are found in foods and the air, people should take certain precautions to limit how exposed they are to CPOs.

{"text":"Mold Test Kits \u2013 Types & Uses\n\nBlack mold is an expensive predicament. It can start out as barely noticeable and then erupt into a serious infestation where entire walls of a room are coated with dark splotches of mold colonies. Black mold at that final stage requires the assistance of professional mold removers and their help isn't cheap. The sooner the mold is detected, the sooner it can be eliminated.\n\nDetection has been made a bit easier by the availability of mold test kits on the market. The kits fall into two categories: air and surface. As the titles suggest, one detects the evidence of black mold in the air (airborne spores) while the other detects mold growing on surfaces such as walls and floors. Mold spore traps are used to discover spores in the atmosphere. It has a sticky slide surface and room air is blown over it using a pump. Particles that are currently in the air stick to the slide and the slide is then examined for the presence of black mold. An air impactor will use a petri dish full of fluid to catch mold spores as they are blown over the open dish. If either test kit does nothing else, both give an idea of the current quality of the air.\n\nA swab test will use a cotton swab or an adhesive tape to collect a sample from a surface suspected of having black mold growing on it. This test doesn't cost much in terms of time or money, but the tester ought to wear protective gloves to prevent contact with the mold. There are times when the contamination is visibly obvious and the need is to determine how serious the situation is. A bulk sample, material pieces larger than what would be stored in a test tube, are collected and sent to a laboratory for closer analysis by trained professionals. This test does mean that some part of the building will have to be damaged in order to obtain the sample, unless there is some fabric or other material that can be easily collected and sent.\n\nAir and space mold test kits share one thing in common: neither can be used to detect mold in the other's environment. For instance, a swab test is almost useless in finding black mold spores in a room's air space, while a mold spore trap isn't designed to diagnose black mold's infestation of a wall. Because using only one form of test can give an incomplete picture or scope of them problem, however, it is recommend that both be used to give a full understanding of the degree to which black mold has established itself, and ensure the safest precautions be taken to remove it.\n\nThere is something else to keep in mind once a contaminated area has been identified; removal procedures for advanced stages of black mold infestation are not DIY projects. Worst case scenario, these situations can call for a home evacuation and experienced professionals must be called in to solve the problem. If the results of a mold test kit indicate more than superficial evidence of black mold, immediate and technically sophisticated remedies ought to be applied as quickly (and safely) as possible. Mold test kits can help to uncover the level of black mold contamination and this information can then be used to decide what is the best corrective action to be taken."}

Pollutants like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are emitted by many industries, and these are rapidly depleting the ozone layer.\n\nThis is potentially dangerous, since the ozone layer serves to absorb the ultra-violet B rays, which otherwise would have traveled to the earth's surface, causing skin related disorder, including cancer to people exposed to the rays.The affects of pollution are well known and hence, we need to take action to stop pollution.\n\nPeople can help stop air pollution by taking up various initiatives. Primarily, in metropolitan and cosmopolitan areas, people can contribute by opting for a public transport system to commute to their work places and back home, rather than using personal cars. Else, they can initiate car-pooling where 3 or 4 members can use a single car to reach their office premises. Reducing the number of vehicles plying on the roads will drastically reduce the air pollution. Another, age old method is to plant trees, and more importantly conserve trees. The trees are effective in removing air pollutants by absorbing them.\n\nSimple actions like turning off the lights, fans, heaters and air conditioners when not in use, will be effective in reducing pollution. This is because energy required to run these electronic gadgets and devices is generated in power stations, which are a primary source of pollution.\n\nAnother way is to buy organic products. They are expensive, but that is a way in which you can contribute to a greener environment. This is due to a whole lot of pesticides and artificial fertilizers are used in producing vegetables and fruits in the usual farming methods. This not only pollutes the soil, but also the air and water due to the waste products from the factories producing the chemical and fertilizers, and the chemicals and fertilizers running from farms into water bodies and groundwater. Thus, by opting for organic products, which use natural fertilizers like manure and compost, we can contribute towards reducing pollution around us."}
{"text":"Cabin air filters keep drivers breathing easier\n\nBy Ron Cox\n\nPollen. Mold spores. Dust. Exhaust gas-es. These are just some of the pollutants that can travel through a truck's ventilation system and into its cabin\u2014a problem that can be especially severe during the hot summer months.\nContaminants inside vehicle cabins can be up to six times more concentrated than outside. These microscopic particles can lead to allergies, asthma and other respiratory illnesses. In fact, 50 million people in the U.S. alone have some sort of respiratory problem, and 20 percent of allergy patients are said to have problems with their allergies in vehicles.\nOne way to improve the quality of air drivers breathe while on the road is by using a cabin air filter. The right cabin air filter can:\n\u2022 Remove irritating respirable particles like pollen, mold spores, dust and exhaust gases before they reach the breathing air inside the vehicle. (One study found that vehicles without cabin air filters have more than 40 percent greater concentrations of mold spores than vehicles without the filters.)\n\u2022 Reduce dust accumulation to keep the vehicle's interior cleaner.\n\u2022 Reduce strain on heating and A\/C systems to keep them running at peak performance.\nA cabin air filter can only perform when it's maintained correctly. For passenger vehicles, that means replacing the cabin air filter once a year, every 12,000-15,000 miles, or as directed by the vehicle's service manual. Driving in heavy traffic, urban or dusty environments, or on dirt roads may shorten the filter's life.\nWhen cabin air filters are not regularly re-placed, the following may result:\n\u2022 Musty odors inside the vehicle's cabin due to fungus growth on the evaporator.\n\u2022 Heater and air conditioner may become damaged by corrosion.\n\u2022 Contaminant levels in the cabin may increase.\n\u2022 Outside airflow drops dramatically in both heat and A\/C modes.\n\u2022 Heating and cooling efficiencies are reduced.\n\u2022 Windows fog up easily in the fresh mode.\nThe filter media inside cabin air filters plays a crucial role in achieving good cabin air quality. Because not all cabin air filters are created equal, look for the following features when selecting a cabin air filter: electrostatically treated synthetic media for high filtration efficiency; low pressure drop; high dust-holding capacity; durability for long life; moisture resistance so that microbial growth is not supported; and thermally bonded continuous fibers to prevent fiber shedding.\nKeep in mind that traditional particulate air filters are not effective at removing odors and gaseous contaminants. That's why some cabin air filters feature activated carbon to adsorb odors and other gaseous molecules. Since activated carbon is one of the strongest physical adsorbents, it is an excellent material for removing odors and other gases from the air inside vehicles to create a fresh and clean-smelling environment.\nRon Cox is the market manager for Kimberly-Clark Filtration Products."}

{"text":"Clean Air Month\n\nWhen: Month of May\n\nHaving clean air is important to our health, and the rise of pollution throughout the world has made clean air harder and harder to find. Not having clean air has horrible effects on our lungs and hearts, so improving the quality of air is to everyone's advantage"}
{"text":"Related Articles\n\nSitting in traffic triples a person's short-term heart-attack risk. Living in a city with heavy air pollution such as Los Angeles is as risky for the heart as being a former smoker. And having a house near a highway ups the risk of hardened arteries by some 60 percent. In each case, tiny \"ultrafine\" particles in the air may be a key culprit.\n\nWhile air pollution comes in many forms, scientists are increasingly concerned about its most minute constituents\u2014virus-size particles produced by combustion. These ultrafines, which measure no more than 0.1 micrometer in diameter, are ubiquitous near roadways and are emerging as one of the most dangerous components of air pollution, which kills an estimated 60,000-plus Americans a year. That's more than the number killed annually by automobile accidents.\n\nThe tiny particles are worrisome for several reasons. For one, they tend to be rich in potentially toxic organic compounds and other reactive chemicals. Their size, moreover, allows them to travel deep into the lungs, lodge there for long periods, and stress the body in a variety of ways, researchers theorize. They may even slip into the bloodstream, where they can do further damage. In comparison, so-called fine particulates, which can be up to 25 times wider than ultrafines, are snared more easily by protective hairlike structures in the nose and throat. Not that fine particulates are benign: Last year, a study of older women in the New England Journal of Medicine linked a 10-microgram-per-cubic-meter increase in fine particulate pollution\u2014approximately the difference between Pittsburgh and cleaner Anchorage\u2014to a 76 percent increase in the cardiovascular death rate.\n\nMore recent data seem to confirm researchers' suspicions that smaller particles are even worse. With Environmental Protection Agency funding, a team co-led by Jesus Araujo, an environmental cardiologist at UCLA, zoomed in on the ultrafines and found that mice exposed to those particles developed more atherosclerotic plaque than mice breathing fine particulates only\u2014and did so faster. \"Much, much faster,\" says Araujo. In addition, HDL, or good cholesterol, didn't work as well in ultrafine-exposed animals, Araujo's team will report in the March 14 Circulation Research. Other recent experiments have found troubling cardiovascular changes in human volunteers following exposure to ultrafines.\n\nSuch findings are bad news for people with heavy exposure to traffic. Diesel vehicles are particularly potent sources of both fine and ultrafine particles, and their fumes, recent studies show, have adverse effects on the heart. European researchers found, for example, that exercising men who inhaled fresh diesel fumes at levels that can occur near major roads experienced rapid reduction in blood flow to the heart and a one-third drop in a protective protein that prevents dangerous clotting. \"The effect was about the same as what we see with secondhand smoke,\" explains Nicholas Mills, the University of Edinburgh cardiologist who led the research.\n\nAt risk. The elderly, young children, and those with pulmonary and cardiovascular problems are most at risk from particulate air pollution. However, particles affect everybody. Recent Taiwanese research shows, for example, that inflammation, oxidative stress, and other cardiovascular warning signs are detectable among urban teens breathing polluted air as well.\n\nWhile fine particulate matter and certain smog-generating emissions are regulated, ultrafine particles are not. \"There's no doubt particulate matter is the elephant in the room,\" says Dan Costa, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency's air research program. Since 1997, the agency has been cracking down on fine particulates, and their levels have generally been falling nationwide. A new rule, phased in last year, requires trucks to use cleaner-burning diesel fuel and should help reduce both fines and ultrafines. But it may be a decade, Costa says, before scientists amass enough evidence on ultrafines to justify directly limiting them.\n\nA third to a half of ultrafine exposure comes from driving. \"If you have otherwise healthy habits and don't smoke, driving to work is probably the most unhealthy part of your day,\" says Scott Fruin, an environmental scientist at the University of Southern California. The tiny particles can also slip into homes, especially those near busy roads. Cooking with a poorly ventilated stove can be another source of exposure to ultrafines, he says. Some fireplaces also generate particulates. However, so-called HEPA filters can help clear indoor air of particulates, including ultrafines.\n\nAvoiding exposure. Exercising near traffic increases one's exposure, since heavy breathing draws particles deep into the body. Murray Mittleman, a cardiologist at Harvard University, suggests that people\u2014especially those with heart conditions\u2014try to exercise away from major roadways. Masks probably won't have much of an effect on the tiny ultrafines, says Fruin, but might stop larger particles. (Some U.S. Olympians, in fact, have been advised to wear face masks in heavily polluted Beijing.) Two government websites, airnow.gov and epa.gov\/airtrends, can help people plan outdoor activities.\n\nStill, there's no reason to live in complete fear of particulates; the risk for any individual remains quite small. That tripling of heart attack risk due to traffic exposure, for example, sounds frightening but is similar to the increased short-term risk posed by exercise or even sexual activity, says Robert Brook, a University of Michigan cardiologist. \"The absolute risk\u2014meaning the risk you have every single time you are exposed to air pollution, exercise, or have intercourse\u2014is still very, very low,\" he says. \"But when you multiply that by the tens of millions of people being exposed to polluted air all of the time, you end up getting large numbers of people who are affected.\"\n\nAraujo, for one, isn't taking any chances. He used to bike frequently in heavy traffic. However, after seeing what happened to his mice, he says: \"You won't find me stuck behind bus tailpipes anymore.\""}
{"text":"Follow Us\n\nParticulate Matter\n\nVery small, or fine, particles are released into the air around us\u2014or are created\u2014by emissions from many natural and manmade sources, including power plants. There are hundreds of types and sources of fine particles. While electric utilities remove more than 99 percent of direct fine particle emissions produced by their power plants, reactions in the atmosphere involving emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) generate sulfates and nitrates, two of the many types of fine particulate matter.\n\nAir Quality Standards for PM\n\nIn 1997, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particles to create new fine particle (PM2.5) standards\u201415 micrograms per cubic meter for an annual average and 65 micrograms per cubic meter for a 24-hour average. Even as states are now preparing implementation plans to meet the 1997 standards (with deadlines to attain the standards by 2010), EPA recently revised the daily standard again.\n\nIn September 2006, EPA tightened the daily standard from 65 to 35 micrograms per cubic meter; however, EPA did not find compelling evidence to support a change to the annual standard of 15 micrograms per cubic meter. Existing air quality improvement programs are expected to bring most of the country into compliance with the 1997 standards by 2010. In December 2008 EPA told Governors in 25 states that the 2006 standard was not met in one or more localities.\n\nPower plants are reducing emissions.\n\nThe U.S. electric power sector has reduced air emissions substantially under existing programs. The industry has cut sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 48 percent and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions by 54% between 1980 and 2007. The industry will achieve much greater reductions over the next decade due to EPA and state regulations like EPA's Clean Air Visibility Rule, the tightened 2006 particulate matter standard, the tightened 2008 ozone standard and EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule or whatever replaces it. The power sector also has cut emissions of mercury by about 40 percent through efforts to reduce other pollutants. The electric power industry has achieved these reductions despite enormous increases in electricity generation (75% since 1980).\n\nBetter science is needed to set appropriate PM standards.\n\nImposing stricter regulations for fine particulate matter will not necessarily produce additional health benefits beyond those achieved through the current standards, but will further exacerbate energy prices and prove burdensome to local economies. In fact, EPA's September 2006 rule is estimated to have an annual price tag of tens of billions of dollars. Even if it is assumed that current concentrations of fine particulate matter in the ambient air contribute to adverse health effects, it has not been established that emissions from power plants generate the particles of concern. EPA's own Office of Inspector General and the National Academy of Sciences, among others, have found that more research is needed to determine the specific types of particulate matter responsible for health concerns so that EPA can set meaningful standards and implement air quality programs with tangible benefits."}

The\ngroupings were based on six housing characteristics: average number of\npersons per household, proportion of housing units in multiple-family\ndwellings, proportion of manufactured homes, proportion of housing units\noccupied by renters, proportion of housing units built before 1979, and\nproportion of housing units built from 1980 to 1989. The cluster\nanalysis resulted in six groupings of counties. When one county was\nrandomly selected from each group, the resulting selection comprised\nChenango, Columbia, Essex, Franklin, Wyoming, and Hamilton countiesHamilton County is the name of a number of counties in the United States of America, named for Alexander Hamilton, first United States Secretary of the Treasury (except as indicated below):\n\nHamilton County, Florida\n\nHamilton County, Illinois\n\n.\n\nTo arrive at a total sample of approximately 350, weighted random\nsampling based on population was conducted in each county. The final\nsample size was n = 328. Telephone surveys with an adult head of the 328\nhouseholds were conducted to determine demographic and housing\ncharacteristics. Each household was offered air quality tests; 132\nhouseholds consented, and a technician tested these homes during the\nheating season of 2000-2001. Table 1 gives the household demographic\nprofiles for the sample.\n\nTo select child care facilities for the study, the authors obtained\na listing of all child care facilities from the Daycare and Child\nDevelopment Council in each of the six counties. Facilities included\nfamily daycare (up to six children cared for in the home of a provider),\ngroup family daycare (up to 12 children in a home), and daycare centers\n(located in a community facility--e.g., a church). From the list of 500\nfacilities obtained, 150 were randomly selected to receive a letter\ndescribing the study and requesting participation; a second letter was\nlater sent to obtain a final sample of 75 facilities.\n\nOf the 75 facilities, 13 were centers (a church, a community\nbuilding, or a building designed as a child care center); 52 were family\ndaycare homes; and 10 were group family daycare homes. Directors of the\n75 facilities completed a telephone survey and were offered indoor air\nquality tests. Although 57 facilities initially granted such permission,\nonly 24 facilities actually made appointments for site visits once\ntesting began. This unwillingness to participate is understandable given\nliability concerns. A technician conducted the on-site air quality tests\nduring the heating season of 2000-2001. Of the 24 facilities in which\nair quality tests were conducted, seven were centers, 14 were family\ndaycare homes, and three were group family daycare homes.\n\nRadon levels were tested with activated carbon canisters in the\nlowest living area of each home. Carbon levels were tested with\na Bacharach[R] sample draw carbon monoxide analyzer for 10-15 minutes in\nthe central living area of each household; within 5 feet of fuel-burning\ncentral heatingcentral heating Noun\n\na system for heating a building by means of radiators or air vents connected to a central source of heat\n\ncentrally heatedadj\n\nNoun1. systems; and, in homes with gas ranges and ovens, at the\ngas oven vent at oven startup and when the oven reached 350[degrees]F.\nThe technician made visual tests for asbestos and basement mold.\nSurface-dust sampling, with a gauzegauze (gawz) a light, open-meshed fabric of muslin or similar material. absorbable gauze gauze made from oxidized cellulose. pad moistened with ,\nwas used to test for lead on the floor beneath windows.\n\nRadon levels were regressed on income, the presence of mold in the\nbasement, county, and whether a kitchen exhaust fan was ducted to the\noutdoors. The presence of mold was used as a proxy for general condition\nof the basement, county as a location indicator, and exhaust fan as a\nhouse depressurization indicator. House depressurization has been linked\nwith elevated radon levels (Roberson, Brown, Koomey, & Greenberg,\n1998). Test results for radon, lead, and carbon monoxide in households\nare given in Table 2. Visual identification results for asbestos and\nmold in households are given in Table 3.\n\nThe technician for this study visited 14 of the child care\nfacilities during the heating season to conduct air quality tests that\nincluded carbon monoxide tests. Because none of the administrators of\nthe remaining seven facilities agreed to activate heating systems during\nthe warmer months when they were visited, heating system-related carbon\nmonoxide tests were not conducted at those facilities. In addition, 15\nfacilities had electric cook stoves, so only nine oven-related carbon\nmonoxide tests were conducted. For the total of 17 heating\nsystem-related carbon monoxide levels that were measured, no levels over\nthe maximum exposure level were detected, not even in one facility in\nwhich a disconnected flue flue\n\nTesting for radon, lead, asbestos, and mold in the child care\nfacilities followed the same procedures used for the homes.\n\nResults\n\nResults from the radon regression show a significant and negative\nrelationship between household income and radon. This negative\nrelationship is likely due to lower-quality housing among lower-income\ngroups and housing deficiencies that create radon pathways, such as\nfoundation cracks and dirt basement floors.\n\nRegressions with carbon monoxide and lead levels, with independent\nvariables related to age and condition of the house, did not show this\nrelationship. This may be due to the small number of homes (seven) with\nlead in floor dust above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's\n(U.S. EPA's) maximum allowable level of 40 [micro]g\/[ft.sup.2].\nHowever, there was a significant and negative correlationNoun1.negative correlation - a correlation in which large values of one variable are associated with small values of the other; the correlation coefficient is between 0 and -1 indirect correlation between income\nand carbon monoxide levels at oven temperature (350[degrees]F) (r =\n-.402; p = .01), which is probably related to insufficient exhaust in\nthe kitchen or poorly maintained appliances.

Lower-income\nhouseholds also are more likely to have older cooking appliances that\nhave not been maintained.\n\nTable 4 indicates that unsafe levels of lead and radon were\nobserved in the child care facilities. Particularly disturbing are the\nlead levels detected, which were seven times higher than U.S. EPA's\nmaximum exposure level. Table 5 shows that asbestos was present in 27\npercent of the facilities.

Therefore, the authors cannot make\nany conclusions about hazard level. Mold was observed in one-third of\nthe facilities.

A low or narrow space, such as one beneath the upper or lower story of a building, that gives workers access to plumbing or wiring equipment.\n\nNoun1. that was littered with debris.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe finding of a significant and negative relationship between\nincome and radon exposure in this sample is similar to the finding by\nChi and Laquatra (1990). It does not mean that low household income\nincreases radon levels in a home, but that low-income households tend to\nlive in lower-quality housing than do higher-income households. In areas\nprone to high radon levels, those lower-quality units are likely to have\nmore radon pathways into the home. In a study of indoor air quality in\n23 low-income homes, Tsongas (1995) reported that one-third of the homes\nhad ovens that caused carbon monoxide levels exceeding 9 ppm in the\ncooking area. Tsongas also reported on several other studies that\nexamined oven-produced carbon monoxide levels in homes. One\nrecommendation from that research was the need to stress the importance\nof using exhaust fans while cooking to reduce carbon monoxide. This\nrecommendation is not always practical, however, as 60 percent of the\nhomes in the current study did not have operable kitchen exhaust fans.\nThe significant and negative correlation between oven-produced carbon\nmonoxide and income warrants further study.\n\nAlthough the two-stage random-sampling procedure used in this study\nproduced a representative sample of all non-metropolitan counties in New\nYork State, the small sample size warrants a cautious interpretation of\nresults. The significant relationships observed between lower-income\nhouseholds and certain indoor air pollutants have, however, been\nreported by other researchers and should be investigated in a larger\nfollow-up study.\n\nIn the child care facilities, the high levels of radon and lead and\nthe presence of mold are cause for serious concern. The highest lead\nlevel (240 [micro]g\/[ft.sup.2]) and highest radon level (6.9 picocuries\nper liter [pCi\/L]) were observed in two different centers. Basement mold\nwas observed in one center and five homes. Asbestos was visually\nidentified in three centers and three homes, but its presence alone does\nnot indicate a health hazardhealth hazard Occupational safety Any agent or activity posing a potential hazard to health. Cf Physical hazard. . For asbestos to pose a health hazard, it\nmust be friable and airborne. Although analyses to determine the extent\nof asbestos hazards were not conducted as part of this research, it is\nworth noting that to prevent hazards from occurring, the asbestos would\nrequire ongoing observation and maintenance. Whether such maintenance\noccurs and whether children are experiencing environmental-pollutant\nexposures in both their homes and their child care facilities are\nsubjects worthy of further investigation.\n\nConclusions and Implications\n\nThe results reported in this paper contribute to the growing\ndiscussion about indoor air quality in lower-income households and child\ncare facilities.

The fact that\npollutant mitigation in privately owned homes remains a personal\nresponsibility, however, creates a policy dilemma. Rural areas have been characterized for years as being in a state of\neconomic decline, which has negative impacts on household income and\nhousing quality (Ziebarth, Prochaska-Cue, & Shrewsbury, 1997).\nLow-income households have few if any resources for pollutant abatement.\nA companion study currently under way at is examining\nthe effectiveness of teaching residents of low-income households\nstrategies to minimize their risks of exposure to indoor air pollutants.\n\nIndoor air quality in child care facilities should be an important\nconcern of facility owners and parents. A three-pronged approach may be\nnecessary to broaden public awareness. First, at the policy level,\nindoor air quality standards could become part of facility license\ngranting and license renewals. Local health departments could administer\nthese requirements when they review other . Second,\nfacility owners and directors could be educated about these issues and\nthereby stay ahead of the policy curve. Initiatives to improve or expand\nchild care facilities could include improving indoor air quality. Design\ncriteriaNoun1.design criteria - criteria that designers should meet in designing some system or device; \"the job specifications summarized the design criteria\" criterion, standard - the ideal in terms of which something can be judged; \"they live by the standards of their for renovations also might include attention to reducing\nexposure to chemicals in flooring or furnishings and ensuring adequate\nair flow (Staes et al., 1994).\n\nThird, parents could be educated about the issues so that they can\ninquire about indoor air quality before enrolling their children in\nchild care facilities. Physicians and other health care providers could\nprovide information to parents on environmental risks during routine\nimmunizations (Koch, 1994).\n\nShould public resources, such as low-interest loans or grants, be\nmade available to low-income households and child care facilities for\nindoor air-pollutant mitigation? To evaluate this question, the overall\ncost of indoor air pollution to society needs to be examined. Lead\npoisoning in children leads to lowered intelligence levels and\nbehavioral problems (Canfield et al., 2003). Mold is a trigger for\nallergies and asthma, both of which lead to school and work absences,\nproductivity losses, and increased health costs (FiskFisk , James 1834-1872.\n\nAmerican railroad financier and speculator who attempted in 1869 to corner the gold market with Jay Gould, leading to Black Friday, a day of nationwide financial panic. , 2000).

{"text":"Radon Entry\n\nRadon gas is being released by each soil granule under the home. This gas becomes part of the air under the home.

Furnace & air conditioning systems then distribute this air through the structure.\n\nThese facts help answer most questions regarding testing fluctuations and repair methods.\n\nUranium\/Radium in the soil is virtually a constant source of radon gas. Changing pressures in the home are typically responsible for \"day to day\" or \"season to season\" fluctuations in radon levels. These fluctuations are usually minor.\n\nRadon is not merely coming from large openings like a sump pit.\n\nRadon is sucked inward from the soil through many openings including gaps smaller than your eyes can see.\n\nConsumer Notice: As radon specialists since 1988, Midwest Radon and AAIR Professionals, Inc. have provided superior services with integrity.

{"text":"We seem to be hearing more and more about molds \u2013 specifically toxic molds \u2013 and their potential for causing health problems. Most of us have heard or read about\nthe Texas couple who lost their home, a husband's career, and nearly a 3-year-old child from a blackish-green mold known as\n\nStachybotrys. Molds have always been present in our environment so what has changed to create so much concern today?\n\nMold 101 \u2013 An Overview Molds, or mildew as they are sometimes called, are types of fungi. They are not plants or animals, but are a separate kingdom of their own. Molds are very common in nature, and are\n\nalways\npresent in both indoor and outdoor air. They feed on dead organic matter, and play an important ecological role by decomposing dead leaves, grass, and other plant material. They reproduce through the release of microscopic spores into the air, much like a dandelion's seed, which can then grow into mold somewhere else, given the right conditions. Mold growth can range from powdery to woolly, and anywhere from white and pink to green, brown and black in color.\n\nTo grow, molds need a food source with high organic content, such as wood, paper, cotton, or other plant-derived materials. They also need moisture, which can come from leaks, floods, condensation, steam, or even\njust high humidity. If mold is found on a surface, then it either currently has, or in the past had, access to moisture.\n\nThe Mold \"Epidemic\"\nSo what's behind this sudden mold epidemic \u2013 are new homes moldier? Modern home design and materials, like fake stucco (a favorite mold food when wet), the way insulation can trap moisture behind walls, and the fact that homes are now more air tight, all tend to expose families for extended periods. This increases their chances of being impacted by mold. Stories like that of the Texas family who were driven out of their home by mold and subsequently awarded a multimillion-dollar settlement create media attention and in some cases, even hysteria. All this awareness feeds the epidemic and keeps this relatively new concept of toxic mold possibly \"living in our homes\" on our minds.\n\nHealth Concerns The most common health problems associated with exposure to mold spores are simply\n\nallergic reactions.\nAllergies to molds usually have the same effects as allergies to hay or pollen, and include symptoms like headaches, sinus problems, sore\nthroats, or coughing. When outdoor levels of molds are highest, such as during the fall leaf mold season, many people experience allergic reactions.\n\nExposures to certain molds now commonly thought of as \"toxic\nmolds\", can bring about more serious health effects and these cases attract most of the attention. As it turns out, it isn't the molds that are toxic, but rather chemicals that are produced by the molds. These\nchemicals, known as\n\nmycotoxins, are associated with\nthe mold's growth, digestion, and self defense processes. Mycotoxins, like the sting of a bee, are toxic to other organisms.\n\nThe greatest factor affecting the development of health problems though, is individual\nsensitivity. Certain people are naturally more sensitive than others to molds and the related mycotoxins. Those who are more susceptible usually include children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, such as\npatients undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nMold Investigations and Testing\nAn investigation for possible mold infestation begins with an inspection for visible mold growth. Whether or not such growth is noticeable, an inspection for signs of water damage, or areas with potential moisture sources is the next step.\n\nRelative humidity levels higher than 60% indoors can also encourage mold growth. If the indoor relative humidity is much higher than that measured outside, this may indicate that too much moisture is being trapped\ninside the house.\n\nWhether there is visible mold growing in a home, or just signs of water damage, or unusually high humidity levels, these are all problems requiring immediate attention.\n\nOnce the moisture source\nis eliminated, and the mold growth properly removed, the problem is usually solved; however, if for medical or legal reasons for instance, there is a need to know what species of molds are growing or releasing spores,\nand in what concentrations, then mold sampling and analysis may be necessary. Although homeowner test kits are becoming more available, they are still somewhat limited in what they can do. Trained and experienced\nprofessionals most accurately perform mold sampling, and microbiologists in accredited laboratories best do the analyses.\n\nMold Remediation\nWhen performing any mold remediation, it is first necessary to find and eliminate the moisture source. If the moisture problem is not resolved, the mold growth will return. So unless you are capable of fixing this primary problem, the first professional you should hire, whether it is a plumber, roofer, or perhaps even a landscaper, is one that gets rid of the moisture source, and ensures it will not return.\n\nUsually, the homeowner can safely manage small areas of non-toxic mold growth. Cleanup of extensive contamination, particularly if the HVAC system or large areas of the home are involved, should be remediated by\npersonnel with training and experience in handling environmentally contaminated materials. Mold levels can increase up to 100,000 times background levels during mold cleanup, possibly resulting in acute exposures.\n\nMold is Everywhere\nAlthough mold is indeed, everywhere, the potential impact of indoor mold growth is substantial. Exposure to certain toxic molds can result in serious health problems, some of which can be long term.\n\nThe early\ndetection and elimination of water infiltration problems are the key elements in the prevention of mold growth in a home. If the presence of excessive moisture is not recognized, but the typical symptoms of mold\nexposure are, the homeowner may benefit from the assistance of a qualified physician, home inspector, indoor air quality consultant, or a combination thereof. Provided the moisture and related mold problems are\nidentified and permanently remediated, the effected homeowners may once again take control over their indoor environment. Molds can then be left to do what we like to have them do \u2013 break down dead leaves and make great\ntasting mushrooms!\n\nJoel Loving is an Indoor Air Quality Consultant, Certified Mold Inspector, President of Environmental\nHealth Consultants, Inc., and a member of the general faculty at the University of Virginia Office of Environmental Health and Safety.

{"text":"The dust that collects in the obscure corners of your attic is usually only good for one thing: reminding you that you haven't cleaned. But for residents of Toms River, it could prove to be more valuable even than gold. It may hold a clue or, perhaps, even a partial answer to why the town has so many cases of childhood cancer.\n\nThe Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI) is analyzing dust samples from specific homes there for a wide variety of chemicals. EOHSI -- which is jointly sponsored by UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) and Rutgers University -- is part of an epidemiological investigation being conducted by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services and the federal Agency of Toxic Substances, Disease and Disease Registry.\n\nThe research was put in motion about three years ago, when several mothers in Toms River -- the largest town in Dover Township --realized there was an unusually high number of cancer cases among their children. The Department of Health determined there were indeed about 23 more cases than expected in an area that size. Between 1979 and 1995, some 90 children in Dover Township contracted various forms of cancer. Since then, six more cases were diagnosed. The state and federal governments are testing the water and the soil in the area, and EOHSI is testing the air.\n\nThe institute is doing a three-pronged study that is looking at air pollution in that area. One segment involves analyzing dust for a variety of chemical pollutants.\n\n\"Whatever particle pollution infiltrates a home, via the air, usually stays there,\" says Natalie Freeman, PhD, MPH, a member of the exposure measurement and assessment division of EOHSI. \"We're taking samples of attic dust that has not been disturbed since the house was built or since a new roof was put on.\" The researchers will also assess internal pollutants that may be in the house, like cigarette smoke.\n\nFreeman, also an adjunct assistant professor at RWJMS, says a 1990 housing census was updated and turned over to an independent statistician who devised a sampling plan. Between three and five houses in each neighborhood have been earmarked for testing. The researchers plan to get samples from 200 homes.\n\nPaul Lioy, PhD, deputy director of EOHSI and principal investigator, says another part of the study will monitor current levels of toxic substances in the air. A measuring device has been placed in the center of Toms River and a second one near the Toms River exit of the Garden State Parkway. The pollutants are being measured for a year, then will be compared to those found in similar studies conducted in other areas of New Jersey and across the country.\n\nThe third leg of the research will create a computer model of an exposure profile, which is an estimate of the rate of transport and the direction of major pollutants in the air to the local community. Prevailing winds are being studied to determine in which direction they blow during certain seasons in Dover Township and how much that could have led to exposure to air pollutants. Historic meteorological records are being used to establish inhalation patterns of pollutants for the effects that have been documented in Toms Rivers.\n\nThat information will be combined with studies of the emissions from major pollution sites. Researchers will try to determine if the air closer to an industrial site -- for example, a smokestack -- would yield higher levels of toxic pollutants in the communities of Dover Township.\n\nThe entire study will be completed by May 2000, and some smaller pieces of it even sooner. \"This is very intense, major research,\" says Lioy. \"Not many other suspected clusters have been studied to this extent. But the design of this study maximizes any potential to detect population exposure to toxins in the environment and then link it with the research of the Department of Health and Senior Services within its Case-Control Epidemiological Study Design. Whatever we find, we hope will help these people.\"\n\nThe magazine\nof the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey"}

Restoration aims to save city from ravages of pollution\n\nBy\nWilliam Echikson, Special to The Christian Science Monitor \/\nOctober 29, 1985\n\nPrague\n\nPrague abounds in beauty. Its ancient churches, gold-tipped spires, baroque, romanesque, and art nouveau buildings stand untouched by the bombs of World War II. Above the Vlatva River, the skyline of the Hradcany Castle, encircling the towers of St. Vitus, commands the exalted emotions of a great romantic 19th-century symphony. Below, the narrow streets and cobblestones play with the intimacy of a perfectly preserved 18th-century string quartet.\n\nAlmost everywhere the eye turns, wooden platforms and metal bars surround buildings. After years of neglect, the government has been trying to restore Prague's glorious past from the midst of its present pollution.\n\n``The downtown ground plan hasn't changed much since Charles IV founded the city in the 14th-century,'' Jan Skoda, the chief of the city's environmental commission explains. ``It was built for horse carriages, and unfortunately cars pollute more than horses.''\n\nThere are other problems, too. Most residents heat their antiquated apartments with dirty brown coal.\n\nThe resulting pollution gives buildings a grimy look -- and threatens those inside. The city's air contains three times more sulfur than what is considered acceptable.\n\nTo fight this scourge, huge sums of money are being spent. Gas heating is being installed in old apartments. New highways are being built on the periphery and a new subway line downtown, which will open next month, may help cut down on car fumes.\n\nBut despite spending 15 billion crowns ($1.5 billion) over the past five years, and preparing to spend 15 billion crowns more, Mr. Skoda admits that all the scaffolding in the world cannot stop the rot of old buildings.\n\n``Every building is damaged,'' he says. ``Copper plate on churches which used to last for centuries is being destroyed, and faades of restored buildings become dirty again after a few years.''\n\nStill, in some ways, life in Prague remains comfortable. Stores are stocked full, if not always with the best quality goods. Restaurants remain rustic, caf'es charming. The superb subway speeds along, spotless and silent.\n\nBut touching tales tumble out from ordinary citizens about life in the past.\n\nOne young woman speaks of her father, who was a professor. After the 1968 Soviet invasion which ended the brief Prague Spring of reform, he refused to sign a loyalty oath. He was banished from the Communist Party and fired from his job. For that crime, his daughter also was punished. She was banned from attending university.\n\nThe story is common. In the years following 1968, more than 500,000 Czechoslovaks were banished from the party. Former professors work as night watchmen, journalists as stokers in steel works. Their children suffer similar fates.\n\nBut the young woman defends her life today.\n\n``Life here is comfortable,'' she says without bitterness. ``We have enough to eat, we have cars, country houses, all without the pressures of trying to get these things in the West. But at the same time you live with a sense of being closed in. There is no space for ambition, for expression. . . ''\n\nFranz Kafka would have understood. The famous writer was born in Prague, was buried in Prague, and spent almost all 41 years of his life in Prague. He always dreamed of leaving; he never did. Staying, he wrote about his nightmares.\n\nWalk to Maisel Street near the Old Town Square and on the wall of a drab building hangs an image of Kafka's face, his brooding, chiseled features cast in bronze. The building rots from disrepair, and Kafka's piercing stare remains partially hidden by nothing other than . . . you guessed it . . . scaffolding.\n\nHere, a small plaque proclaims, stands the spot of the house of the writer's birthplace.\n\nThe modest memorial was unveiled in 1965, at a time when Kafka was metamorphosing from a decadent nihilist into a critic of capitalist alienation.\n\nBut his rehabilitation turned out to be brief. Since 1968, no copies of his works have been published here. Only a few works published in East Germany in German occasionally are available.\n\n``Why should we publish Kafka?,'' asks Vera Adlova, secretary of the government-sponsored Czechoslovakian Union of Writers. ``He's interesting for intellectuals, but the man on the street doesn't want to read him. He always writes about the same thing, the solitude of the individual, a stupid affair leading to absurdity.''"}
{"text":"Ozone (O3) is an allotrope of oxygen (O2). However, it is much less stable. Ozone, at ground level, is one of many air pollutants which harm our respiratory system. In the Earth's upper atmosphere, the function of ozone is to filter dangerous ultraviolet light and minimize the amount that reaches the Earth's surface. Ozone can be found throughout the Earth's atmosphere, though in low concentrations. Ozone, when visible, comes in the form of a pale-blue substance which has an irritating odor. At 0.1 to 1 parts-per-million (ppm) of exposure, ozone can cause headaches, irritation to our respiratory tract, as well as a burning sensation in our eyes. Ozone is mainly found in the Earth's upper atmosphere, in what is commonly known as the ozone layer. In the upper atmosphere, ozone is mostly produced when oxygen reacts with ultraviolet light from the Sun.\n\nOzone found at the troposphere is currently considered a pollutant by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is formed when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons in the air, which forms ozone at the specific point of reaction. Although ozone is present at ground level, the highest concentrations can be found in the Earth's upper atmosphere, as mentioned earlier. This increase in the upper atmosphere is of a greater concern as it is of great importance that the ozone layer is able to sustain itself and continue to protect the world from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light.\nOzone depletion is something which affects the entire planet. Ozone molecules can be broken down by free radical catalysts, some of the main ones being atomic bromide (Br) and atomic chlorine (Cl). In recent years, the concentrations of these two radicals have increased by a remarkable amount due to the continuous release of organohalogen compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons, better known as CFCs. Over the northern hemisphere, ozone levels have been decreasing at a steady rate of 4% per decade. However, due to an international ban of CFCs in most countries, scientists have discovered that ozone depletion may be slowing down. However, not all countries have banned the production and use of CFCs. Thus, we feel that in order for us to protect and sustain the ozone layer, effort has to be put in by the whole world as those countries which ignore the signs of ozone depletion not only end up being affect themselves, but affect everyone else as well.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe ozone layer is an extremely important component of the earth's atmosphere. Without it, humans will be exposed to the ultraviolet irradiation from sunlight. Even though ultraviolet light has beneficial effects, such as its ability to induce the human skin to produce Vitamin D, it is still extremely harmful if we are overexposed to it. Overexposure to ultraviolet light can cause some kinds of skin cancer and cause direct damage to our DNA. Ultraviolet light can also lead to many people's greatest fear, an accelerated speed of the ageing of skin. Thus, this shows the importance of the ozone layer in our atmosphere. For those countries which still do not care about the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer, we feel that this kind of irresponsible behavior should not be condoned. According to scientists, ozone depletion has slowed down probably due to the ban on CFCs, and that ban is not even applied in all countries yet. If it were to become a worldwide ban, the rate of ozone depletion would definitely slow down even more or perhaps even stop as it would become a worldwide effort to save not only ourselves, but everyone else as well."}
{"text":"Top Six Reasons Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is a Hot Topic floodsWe are all exposed to chemicals and pollution \u2013 both indoor and outdoor. Does it all really matter at the end of the day? It may not matter in a short time span, but the exposure to indoor pollution occurs over time and the people who do spend almost all of their time indoors are the most affected. Children, the elderly, as well men and women suffering from respiratory and heart diseases are often the victims of poor IAQ.\n\n4) Energy Efficiency Initiatives Lead to Tighter Building Designs\n\nEnergy efficiency upgrades in new construction and renovations to older structures such as replacing windows, and sealing up windows and doors can save you money on utilities, but they can also affect indoor air quality. A building requires a certain mix of indoor and outdoor air to control pollutant levels. \"If too little outdoor air enters a home, pollutants can accumulate to levels that can pose health and comfort problems,\" reports the EPA.\n\nThe answer to this problem is to ensure the ventilation is providing the proper mix of inside and outside air and to evaluate the airflow after any major updates.\n\nIn the February issue of Indoor Environment Connections, Dr. Harriet Burge, director of Aerobiology EMLab P&K in San Bruno, Calif., writes that \"when temperatures are higher and relative humidity is lower indoors than outdoors, you can have major differences in temperatures and humidity levels in poorly insulated indoor rooms.\" This can lead to condensation, which can lead to mold growth. She recommends heating for closets on outside walls and not placing carpets on floors that aren't insulated.\n\n6) Smoking Indoors\n\nA number of recent news reports show that smoking bans can dramatically improve IAQ. In a recent study from the University of Kentucky on how a smoking ban affected air quality in hospitality venues in Kenton County, Kentucky, indoor air pollution levels dropped 60%. However, the \"split-shift\" exemption that allows smoking in certain establishments at night \"exposed workers to toxic levels of secondhand smoke,\" according to Ellen Hahn, the director of Kentucky's Center for Smoke-Free Policy and the study's lead author.\n\nGoodway has just launched a new line of products that combat the everyday issues HVAC technicians see with managing air quality. Mold and mildew removers and mold inhibitors can help keep air quality at it's best and limit exposure to life threaten allergies and infections. Plus HVAC odor control can be managed more effectively when controlling bacterial growth. These solutions are specifically designed for us in HVAC coils, duct work and condensate pans."}

{"text":"Air pollution in Hong Kong\n\nInformation about Air pollution in Hong Kong\n\nNot only the flora and fauna are affected but also humans. Cases of asthma and bronchial infections have soared in recent years, and doctors place the blame squarely on poor air quality.\n\nSources of pollution\n\nThe dense population, smoke-belching factories and power stations, ceaseless construction and large numbers of diesel vehicles have made for dangerous levels of particulate matter (RSP) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).\n\nWhilst the Government has in the past maintained that the Mainland was an important source of airborne pollutants, experts have estimated that most of Hong Kong's acid rain comes from its own industry and transport: Most of Hong Kong's power is generated by burning coal. Electricity generation produces half of Hong Kong's total emissions of nitrogen oxide and particulates, and 92 per cent of its total sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Most local power stations do not yet have flue gas desulphurisation, although equipment is being installed and the government has required that all new generation capacity should come from natural gas.\n\nHong Kong's roads are also the most crowded in the world, with almost 280 vehicles for every kilometre of road. The city's vehicle fleet is dominated by heavily polluting, aging goods vehicles, most of which run between the city and the Pearl River Delta\/Shenzen. Diesel commercial vehicles are responsible 90% of RSPs and 80% of NO2 emissions from the entire road transport sector, despite making up only 23% of the vehicle fleet. Double-decker diesel buses and a steadily growing fleet of private cars have also added to congestion and pollution[].\n\nDeclining regional air quality means visibility has also decreased dramatically. In 2004, low visibility occurred 18% of the time \u2013 the highest on record, according to the Hong Kong Observatory. [0]The number of days in which visibility was less than eight kilometers rose to 102 in 2005 from 40 in 1997[2].\n\nAccording to Hong Kong University research, the air in Hong Kong contains almost three times more soot and other pollutants than New York's and more than twice of that in London[2]. Environmentalists blame principally the electricity companies, which the government has ordered to cut emissions. Hong Kong has declared the goal of reducing levels of four major pollutants by 55 percent by 2010[2].\n\nChief Executive Donald Tsang Yam-kuen has said Hong Kong's air quality is unacceptable, and has pledged to \"fix it.\" In July 25 2007, the Government launched Action Blue Sky Campaign.\n\nControversy about monitoring\n\nIn June 1995, instead of adopting internationally accepted benchmark index for pollution, it set up the Air Pollution Index as in indicator to pollution levels, both \"General\" and \"Roadside\".\n\nAir Quality Objectives (AQOs) for seven widespread air pollutants were established in 1987 under the Air Pollution Control Ordinance (APCO)[3], and have not been reviewed since it was set up[3]. It is not clear how the levels are determined[3].\n\nIn October 2005, Task Force on Air Pollution criticised the Government for deluding itself with a pollution index that is a \"meaningless\" indicator of health risks[3]. Professor Wong Tze-wai, at the Chinese University commented that the current air pollution index \"gives a false sense of security\"[3]. Gary Wong, a professor at the Chinese University's Department of Paediatrics and School of Public Health, said that under the current index, \"some harmful pollution components aren't even recorded.\" In addition, he pointed out that there is no strategic plan or a timetable to tackle the problem, unlike in other countries[3]\n\nStreet-level air quality regularly falls short of the government's Air Quality Objectives (AQOs), and even further short of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines, revised in October.\n\nAcademics called for Hong Kong Government to immediately update its air quality objectives set almost twenty years ago[3]. For example, on 19 and 20 November 2006, roadside levels of respirable suspended particulates (RSPs \u2013 equivalent to PM10) exceeded the WHO guidelines by at least 300%. Prof Anthony Hedley of the University of Hong Kong said in September 2007 that if Hong Kong's API was based on WHO recommended levels, our readings would be \"absolutely sky high\" for most of the year.[5]\n\nSecretary for Environment, Transport and Works Sarah Liao Sau-tung said the WHO targets were too stringent[4].\n\nHealth implication\n\nThe mortality rate from vehicular pollution can be twice as high near heavily traveled roads, based on a study conducted in Holland at residences 50 meters from a main road and 100 meters from a freeway[3]. Since millions of people in Hong Kong live and work in close proximity to busy roads, this presents a major health risk to city residents. The Hong Kong Medical Association estimates that air pollution can exacerbate asthma, impair lung function and raise the risk of cardio-respiratory death by 2 to 3 percent for every increase of 10 micrograms per cubic metre of pollutants[3]. Studies by local public health experts have found that these roadside pollution levels are responsible for 90,000 hospital admissions and 2,800 premature deaths every year.\n\nDonald Tsang's comments\n\nChief Executive Donald Tsang declared that the high life-expectancy of Hong Kong demonstrates that concerns over air quality were not justified.\n\nInsert the text of the quote here, without quotation marks.\n\nProfessor Anthony Hedley, chair of community medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said \"[Tsang] is badly advised on current public health issues.\" Hedley added that air pollution levels in the SAR were extremely high, and could affect the lungs, blood vessels and heart[4].\n\nJames Tien, whose party represents big business interests, retorted: \"Can [Tsang] really be confident that, if pollution continues to worsen, he will be able to promise the same life expectancy for our children and for our grandchildren?\"[4]\n\nEconomic impact\n\nMade aware of fresh statistical and anecdotal evidence that pollution is driving away business and hurting Hong Kong's global competitiveness, James Tien called air pollution \"a health issue, a lifestyle issue, a tourism issue, a business issue, and increasingly a political issue.\"[5]\n\nMerrill Lynch downgraded several Hong Kong property companies because of air quality concerns, and there have been warnings from the head of the Stock Exchange that pollution was scaring investors away.[5] It said that the air quality in Hong Kong is now regularly so poor that its \"long-term competitiveness is in some doubt\", and advised clients to switch into developers in Singapore instead.[7] Research by three universities and a think-tank estimates that the pollution is costing Hong Kong about HK$21.2 billion a year in hospital admissions and lost productivity. In addition, about 1,600 deaths a year might be avoided if air quality improves.[7]\n\nActions\n\nMotor fuels\n\nAll diesel stations have been successfully converted to Ultra-Low Sulphuric Diesel ones.[2]\n\nIn 1996, the government initiated a test project for LPG as an alternative fuel. Factory-built LPG taxis have been available since 1999. Since January 1 2006, driving a diesel taxi on the streets of Hong Kong became illegal.\n\nParticulates, alternatively referred to as particulate matter (PM), aerosols or fine particles, are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas.

{"text":"A case study of environmental justice work in West Oakland\n\nI teach at Golden Gate University School of Law, in San Francisco, at our law school's in-house clinic, which is staffed by lawyers, students and an environmental scientist. The Clinic primarily serves low-income communities bearing disproportionate environmental burdens. Our clients typically come to see us because they live and work near the fourth largest port in the United States, medical waste incinerators, plants that emit unbearable odors, or neighborhood parks being developed atop contaminated sites. Oftentimes, our clients live next to more than one problem source.\n\nTake one of our clients. She and her family have lived in West Oakland for many generations. West Oakland is the oldest district in Oakland, California, with a rich cultural history. It developed in the mid-1800s as a final stop on the Transcontinental Railroad and became home to many of the Pullman Porters hired to work the sleeping cars on the railroad. West Oakland experienced expansions during the two World Wars, as shipbuilding attracted residents from inside and outside the country, resulting in a diverse group of people living in the area. With the end of World War II, West Oakland suffered from severe job losses, and its economic decline continued through the 1980s. West Oakland today bears witness to its social and economic history. Its residents are 64% African Americans, 16% Latinos, and 9% Asian and Pacific Islanders. West Oakland also hosts numerous abandoned waste sites from its industrial past, contaminated with lead and vinyl chloride, among many other chemicals with multi-syllabic names, as well as a large port that attracts diesel truck traffic and polluting marine vessels. The leading causes of death in West Oakland during 1996 to 1998 were heart disease (27%) and cancer (22%), and respiratory illnesses like asthma are a big problem.\n\nOur client first came to the Clinic to clean up toxins from a neighborhood playground. She came again to the Clinic to deal with an odorous yeast manufacturing facility that was also then the largest emitter of acetaldehyde, a hazardous air pollutant, in the Bay Area. She did not know the details of the Clean Air Act as we did. But, more than anything I could teach her with my fancy degrees, she taught me how environmental laws really work \u2013 or, in her case, don't work.\n\nShe concretely illustrated for me how the laws are insufficient to deal with her community, where residents are exposed to environmental toxins from multiple sources. The yeast plant was not the only problem in her neighborhood. When we talked about the yeast plant, every pollution source in the neighborhood she worried about made it into the conversation \u2013 the playground, the waste site, and the diesel trucks parked and idling in her neighborhood. In the strict legal sense, they were \"irrelevant\" to the core of our legal claims against the yeast plant.\n\nThe Clean Air Act, for example, does not limit air pollution based on risks multiple pollution sources may pose on communities hosting them. Neither does the law limit pollution based on risks multiple chemicals from one source may pose on host communities. The Clean Air Act mostly regulates one pollutant at a time, one source at a time. But our clients do not inhale those pollutants one at a time. The many laws that make multiple sources of pollution irrelevant are wrongheaded.\n\nWith the leadership of people who understand too well what cumulative exposure and risks mean (and who are fortunately and miraculously everywhere), our laws will someday change for the better. But this change won't come easily or quickly. It will take an organized community, funding, and collaborations between impacted communities, academics, scientists, and regulators. Here, grassroots groups and coalitions formed the Bay Area Environmental Health Collaborative to tackle this work, with initial funding from The San Francisco Foundation. The Collaborative's mission is to work for the adoption of measures to reduce air pollution in heavily impacted communities throughout the San Francisco region.\n\nThe lessons from BAEHC's work are numerous. First, the community must be organized and have sufficient funding. Tackling cumulative risk is an enormously difficult task. It challenges the very framework of many of the basic laws, such as land use laws and environmental laws. When we think that disproportionate impacts might mean no longer being able to segregate polluting industries, the notion is too discomforting to many. The work is also challenging because it brings up race. Pollution maps that result from the work of the Collaborative and others like it show a linkage between race and pollution. To be associated with a system that results in such disparities is also discomforting to many, especially regulators.\n\nSecond, regulators will want to study the problem for years before taking action. The California Air Resources Board and South Coast Air Quality Management District initiated their Multiple Air Toxics Exposure Study in 1997; and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District launched its Community Air Risk Evaluation initiative in 2004; they have been studying cumulative impacts for years but have not yet promulgated any rules to control cumulative impacts. To be sure, it is a good thing to develop solid methods for monitoring and modeling cumulative pollution and to quantify it. But even without studies regulators can easily recognize that hot spots exist, and that they can take immediate action to reduce the levels of pollution in those places \u2013 all while regulators continue to study and quantify the extent of the problem. For example, regulators can enact enforceable regulations to take cumulative risks from all air pollution sources into account in granting permits. Depending on the risks, the regulators can impose stricter pollution controls. In fact, the Collaborative is asking the local air district to do exactly that.\n\nThird, since regulators will want to study the problem anyway, let them do the study right. Have them include all of the air pollution risks in the study. Instead of simply studying \"toxic\" air pollution, include particulate matter, which in air parlance is not categorized as a toxic air contaminant but in fact is. Also have the regulators make the study meaningful. Don't let the regulators produce maps without information about race and income. We as a society must face racial and social injustice squarely. To do that, the studies must include data that enable the basic analysis about race, ethnicity and income.\n\nBy the way, our client's community won in that yeast case that I mentioned. The organizing campaign she and other West Oakland community groups led to create a better neighborhood free of offensive odor did something our Clean Air Act claim never would have done by itself: the yeast plant decided to close its West Oakland plant in the face of community opposition. The area nevertheless remains one of the most polluted in the Bay Area. Unless the regulators push for cumulative risk laws, it will continue to be one of the toxic hot spots."}

{"text":"Mold, Indoor Air Quality, and the Work Environment\n\nWork is an inevitable part of everyday life. Many of us spend up to forty hours a week at our jobs. With such a large portion of our lives spent dedicated to our jobs, it's important to make sure that the place we spend so much of our time in is a safe, healthy environment.\n\nMany companies have safety and health protocols already in place, from avoiding carpel tunnel syndrome in an office environment to proper sanitary practices in food service industries. However, there are still potential health hazards that can present themselves from time to time. For instance, there has been much growing concern in recent years regarding the issue of mold contamination in the work place, and its effects on workers who are exposed to it on a daily basis.\n\nMold is a non-animal, non-plant living organism that is in the same family as yeast and mushrooms. It feasts on organic compounds, such as wood and fabric. It thrives in moist environments, like bathrooms, kitchens, basements and crawlspaces. Mold starts out as spores, tiny particles that act as \"seeds\". When conditions are appropriate, mold spores are able to latch on to a surface and begin reproducing at a very rapid rate, quickly creating vast colonies that completely penetrate whatever object they've settled upon. Given the right environment, mold can spread itself through a building in a matter of days.\n\nThankfully, out of the more than thousand strands of mold commonly found in homes and buildings, only a few handfuls are known to cause serious health problems in humans. Generally these problems are found among those with a weakened or compromised immune system, such as children, the elderly, or those who already have medical problems. Symptoms of toxic mold sickness can seem like a cold or flu, with symptoms like fatigue, headaches, sneezing and coughing. Some of the more serious reactions to toxic mold can even include respiratory infections, organ hemorrhaging, cancer, and in very rare circumstances, even death.\n\nOften mold is discovered by visual confirmation or by scent. Mold can come in a variety of colors, such as black, green, red, blue, white, or brown. And if you smell a musty, earthy, or rotten scent, it's likely you're smelling mold. However, sometimes mold can also be present despite a lack of smell or visual aid. If you find that you or your coworkers are consistently suffering from any of the symptoms listed above, it's possible that there may be a mold colony hidden in the walls or carpeting at your work. In this case, it would be a good idea for your employer to have a full inspection and indoor air quality test conducted by a professional environmental services company in order to determine if mold is the cause of the health problems.\n\nBecause mold can have such a drastic effect on people's health, it's important to make sure that the places we live and work are free of mold. It's also important that if you suspect mold to be present in your work environment, that you take appropriate actions in order to ensure the safety of yourself and your fellow employees.\n\nA good first step when you suspect that there may be mold growing in your workplace would be to communicate with your superior directly, so he or she can take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the mold problem is thoroughly looked into and remediated if necessary. If your employer doesn't take your mold remediation request seriously, or you feel that they are not making it a high enough of a priority, you can always escalate the issue by contacting the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA), or your local county health department, since mold in the workplace could certainly count as a safety violation for the employer.\n\nIf you do decide to escalate the problem to such a point, keep in mind that this may put your position at your company in danger. For, while this will certainly be successful in forcing the issue, your employer does not need a reason to terminate your position with them. However, if you do end up being laid off, and you have reason to suspect that it is due to your blowing the whistle on the unsafe environment that you were forced to work in, you can certainly take legal action against your former employer.\n\nIn most cases, however, your employer will realize the importance of having the mold removed from the property, and will generally work with the building owner to make sure the mold is taken care of. However the situation is handled, the first step should be to contact a professional environmental services company who specializes in mold testing and remediation, such as Indoor-Restore Environmental Services, to get more information."}

{"text":"Abstract\n\nThere has been increasing interest in the effect of ultrafine particles (UFP) on human cardiovascular and respiratory health. The adverse health impacts due to particle exposure are currently attributed to the mass concentration or the chemical composition of particles smaller than 10 \u03bcm (PM10) or 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) in diameter. However, it has been hypothesised that it is actually UFP (< 0.1 \u03bcm) measured in terms of number concentration, as opposed to mass concentration, that might be responsible for the observed health effects. This paper presents the results of a critical literature review aimed at analysing the current state of epidemiological evidence for the effects of UFP on human health. In summary, the array of epidemiological studies conducted thus far suggests that UFP exposure is associated with human mortality, and respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity. This holds true despite the considerable gaps in knowledge that remain, and despite the inconsistencies found between some studies, resulting from some deficiencies in the study designs. The limited number of epidemiological studies conducted thus far indicates that there are comparable health effects of fine and ultrafine particles, which appear to be independent of each other. Fine particles show more immediate effects whilst ultrafine particles show more delayed effects on mortality. However, at present the database is too limited (in terms of both number of studies and number of subjects) and geographically restricted, to allow clear conclusions on the mode of action and\/or generalisation to other settings. Consequently, it is recommended that further, better-designed studies be initiated to improve the understanding of health impacts of UFP"}

{"text":"Reducing Car Idling Saves Money, Improves Air Quality\n\nMEMPHIS, TN--Car idling is expensive and harmful to your health and the environment. During the winter, chilly mornings mean many of us warm up our cars before heading to work and the Shelby County Health Department says you could be throwing money away.\n\nFor every two minutes a car idles, you use the same amount of fuel it takes to drive one mile. The more time you let your car idle, the more gas you waste and the more money you will spend in the long run. Experts say turning off your car when sitting in a drive thru, in a school pick up line, or at a bank can have big benefits.\n\nAccording to Larry Smith, Supervisor of Air Quality for Shelby County, \"It actually uses less fuel starting an engine than it does idling it.\"\n\nIf 10% of drivers in the U.S. would reduce idle time by 5 minutes a day, we'd save around 84.5 million gallons of gas a year. \"You are both spending money needlessly in the fuel you're using and you're producing pollution that doesn't need to occur,\" says Smith.\n\nIdling your car not only pollutes the environment, but you also breathe in harmful fumes. Air movement helps to diffuse fumes from your car and when you are not moving, the fumes have nowhere to go but into the air you are breathing.\n\n\"Small individual actions can have a huge impact when done across a small percentage of users,\" says Smith. Just like recycling and water conservation, reducing car idle time is a habit we all need to develop."}

Drones like these fly from a base in South Korea now to sample China's air pollution.\n\nGuiding a small squadron of robotic aircraft and fielding a network of ground stations, scientists from the United States, China, and South Korea this summer are putting vast plumes of Asian air pollution under some of the most exhaustive scrutiny ever.\n\nThe three-month campaign, dubbed CAPMEX, represents the latest in a series of ambitious international field experiments during the past decade aimed at closing a gap in atmospheric science: the need to understand how human-produced soot and tiny particles dubbed aerosols affect climate.The air-pollution issue took on added visibility with the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, which ended Sunday. Air quality was a key concern for many athletes, particularly those taking part in strenuous outdoor events.\n\nBut beyond public-health concerns, pollution in the form of aerosols and soot \u2013 byproducts from burning coal and oil as well as from burning vegetation to clear farmland or as fuel for cooking \u2013 are increasingly seen as important yet complex players in Earth's climate.\n\nOne sign of that complexity appeared earlier this month, when scientists from the US and Israel showed how smoke from fires set to clear farmland in the Amazon in the dry season could either prevent clouds from forming, or accelerate cloud formation. The outcome depended on the amount of aerosols, how cloudy the skies were to begin with, and cloud height. Ironically, either outcome can reduce rainfall: The aerosols can warm and dry out the air, or they can spawn so many cloud droplets that they exhaust available moisture before droplets can grow heavy enough to fall as rain. The work, led by the Weizmann Institute's Ilan Koren, appeared in the journal Science."}
{"text":"Winter smogs\n\nBelgium experiences winter smogs on a regular basis. Smogs can adversely affect our health. They are caused by the accumulation of car exhaust pollutants, industrial activity and emissions from domestic and office central heating systems. Smogs occur between the months of October and March, when weather conditions, such as low temperatures, lack of wind and above all the phenomenon of thermal inversion (when lower layers of air are cooler than upper layers), prevent the dispersion of pollution in the air. This results in a general reduction in air quality which may have an adverse effect on those of delicate health, and also on the entire population. Smogs may last for a few hours or several days.\n\nEmergency measures must be taken to avoid these smogs. These measures are aimed at reducing the emission of pollutants (48 hours in advance) so that the expected peak is not reached. There are 3 levels of intervention depending on the duration and intensity of the smog:\n\nLevel 1: speed restriction of 50 km\/h (or less if indicated) applicable to all vehicles throughout the Brussels city region\n\nLevel 2 : ban on cars with even or odd number plates throughout the Brussels city region; ban on heavy goods vehicles during rush hours; underground trains, trams and buses are free and additional services are provided\n\nLevel 3 : Level 3: total ban on cars throughout the Brussels city region; underground trains, trams and buses are free and additional services are provided\n\nAlthough level 1 threshold is reached 2 to 3 times per year, thresholds 2 and 3 are much less common (level 2 is reached only once every 2 or 3 years).\n\nWhether you are an individual or an enterprise, you will be adversely affected by a deterioration in air quality, especially when smog occurs.

{"text":"Environment\n\nHealth\n\nAbout Ozone\n\nOzone is a gas that you cannot see or smell. Ozone occurs naturally in the sky about 10 to 30 miles above the Earth's surface. Sometimes, this ozone is called \"good ozone\" because it forms a layer that protects life on earth from the sun's harmful rays. Ground-level ozone can be harmful for your health and the environment.\n\nGround-level ozone forms when pollutants from cars and trucks, power plants, factories and other sources come in contact with each other in heat and sunlight. Factors such as weather conditions and intensity of sunlight also play a part in how ozone is formed. Ground-level ozone is one of the biggest parts of smog, and it is usually worse in the summer months.\n\nMany urban areas tend to have higher levels of ground-level ozone but rural areas have ground-level ozone, too. Wind carries ozone and the pollutants that form it hundreds of miles from their original sources, and rural areas have sources of ozone that contribute to this problem.\n\nAbout Particulate Matter\n\nParticle pollution, or particulate matter, consists of particles that are in the air, including dust, dirt, soot and smoke, and little drops of liquid. Some particles, such as soot or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen. Other particles are so small that you cannot see them.\n\nParticle pollution can come from primary or secondary sources. A primary source, such as wood stoves or forest fires, lets off particle pollution directly. A secondary source lets off gases that react and form particles. Examples of secondary sources are coal fires and power plants. Particle pollution also comes from motor vehicles, factories, and construction sites. These can be primary or secondary sources. Particle pollution can be a problem at different times of the year, depending on where you live.\n\nParticle pollution includes:\n\ncoarse particles that are between 2.5 and 10 micrometers\n\nfine particles that are between 0.1 micrometers and 2.5 micrometers (also known as PM2.5)\n\nultrafine particles that are smaller than 0.1 micrometers.\n\nParticles bigger than 10 micrometers can irritate your eyes, nose and throat but do not usually reach your lungs. Ten micrometers is about seven times thinner than one human hair.\n\nFine and ultrafine particles are the size of most concern because they are most likely to cause health problems. Their small size allows them to get into the deep part of your lungs and even into your blood."}
{"text":"Related Topics\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Households in developing countries that regularly burn wood, straw, dung and other natural materials are more likely to also contain children with anemia, a new report finds.\n\nFamilies in 29 countries who burned so-called \"biofuels\" for cooking or heating were 7 percent more likely to include a child with mild anemia.\n\nWhen the researchers from McMaster University in Canada compared national-level data, they found that the countries with more residents burning biofuels were also home to more children with moderate or severe anemia.\n\n\"As a substantial proportion of people still rely on biofuels for domestic energy in developing countries, they need to be aware that exposure to biofuel smoke is associated with health risks and that they need to protect their children and themselves from being exposed to this harmful smoke,\" study author Hmwe Hmwe Kyu told Reuters Health.\n\nNearly half of children under the age of 5 living in developing countries develop anemia, putting them at risk of cognitive impairments, developmental problems, and other serious, potentially life-threatening consequences.\n\nAnemia is caused by a deficiency of blood cells or of hemoglobin, the iron-rich molecules within blood cells that transport oxygen from the lungs to body tissues.\n\nInhaling smoke from burning biofuels has already been linked to a host of other health problems, such as low birth weight and pneumonia in children.\n\nIn theory, burning biofuels could also cause anemia because the smoke contains pollutants such as carbon monoxide, which binds to and reduces the available amount of hemoglobin, and other compounds that can destroy red blood cells directly.\n\nBurning natural materials for cooking and heating remains very common in developing countries, however, and the number of people who rely on biofuels is expected to climb to 2.6 billion by 2030.\n\nTo investigate whether burning biofuels might indeed increase the risk of anemia, Kyu and colleagues reviewed data collected from families living in 29 developing countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean region. In all, 117,454 children were represented in the study.\n\nGiven that other aspects of life in those countries might be behind an apparent biofuel-anemia link, the researchers used statistical tools to control for the influence of poverty, childhood illness, smoking, and other potentially confounding factors.\n\nReporting in the Annals of Epidemiology, they found that 24 percent of children had mild forms of anemia, and nearly 39 percent had a more moderate to severe form of the condition.\n\nIn addition, they found that the relationship between anemia and exposure to biofuels was exacerbated when children also had diarrhea or a fever. In other words, compared with children who were not exposed to biofuel smoke and did not have diarrhea, exposed children with diarrhea were 22 percent more likely to have mild anemia.\n\nIf breathing in smoke from natural materials is triggering childhood anemia, improved stoves might help, the authors note - however, each unit likely costs anywhere from $25 to $150, Kyu said in an e-mail to Reuters Health.\n\nThey acknowledge that the smoke may not be the only source of the problem and they were unable to tease out the possible roles of all other factors. \"For example, we were not able to control for intestinal parasitic infections and lead poisoning, which may have contributed to residual confounding in our study,\" Kyu added.\n\nKyu cautioned that the study focused on use of biofuels by individuals, and does not discuss the potential effects of living near a facility manufacturing ethanol for widespread use, for instance. \"The results may not apply to large-scale biofuel efforts.\""}

Most people are aware that outdoor air pollution can damage their health but may not know that indoor air pollution can also have significant harmful effects.\nU. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) studies of human exposure indicate that the levels for many pollutants may be 2-5 times higher indoors than outdoors. High\nlevels of indoor air pollutants are significant because it is estimated that people spend as much as 90% of their time indoors.\nOver the past several decades, our exposure to indoor air pollutants has increased due to a variety of factors, including the construction of well-sealed buildings, reduced ventilation rates, the use of synthetic building materials and furnishings, and the use of chemically formulated personal care products, pesticides, and household cleaners.\n\nIndoor Air Quality Solutions\n\nClean Indoor Air\nA clean home includes having clean air.

{"text":"IAQ Solutions\n\nThere are many ways to improve the indoor air quality (IAQ) in your home. Solutions can range from mechanical adjustments on your heating and cooling system to something as simple and inexpensive as altering some of your habits and product choices.\n\nSource control means limiting the amount of pollutants in your home and it is an important step in improving the quality of air you breathe. The following sections describe some easy ways to control sources of common indoor air quality problems.\n\nParticle Allergens\n\nThe EPA cautions that the air inside your home is typically two to five times more polluted than outdoor air. How can this happen? One way to understand how the air inside your house can be two to five times worse than outdoor air\u2014despite cleaning your home\u2014is to realize where the air you breathe inside comes from and how it behaves inside your home.\n\nAir enters your home each time you open a door or window. With that air comes dust, dirt, pollen, spores, and other parts of the \"outside\" that you would prefer to keep there. Air does not always arrive through obvious sources like doors and windows. Cracks, fissures, windows that aren't sealed tightly, and attached garages can all deliver polluted air. Once inside your home, air is recirculated, becoming slightly more polluted each time dinner is cooked, the carpets are vacuumed, or cleaning products are used. Many common household activities produce indoor air pollution. There are a number of easy steps you can take to control sources of airborne particles in your home:\n\n- Use a doormat\u2014A wipe-off mat will cut down on one of the biggest carriers of particulates in your home: the bottom of your shoes. For those with allergies, asthma, or other particle sensitivities, removing shoes in an entry area or foyer will reduce the amount of particulates that are tracked into a home.\n\n- Use high efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) or central vacuum system\n\n- Cleaning the dust and dirt from your carpets is an important part in keeping your home's air clean. Trapping the dirt in a closed container is even more important.\n\n- Old-fashioned vacuums with a paper bag may potentially do little more than noisily redistribute dust from the carpet into the air. Purchase a cleaner that will trap the dust and dirt in a container, such as a HEPA vacuum, or even better, a whole-home central vacuum system which vents to the outside.\n\n- Limit smoking indoors\u2014The U.S. Office of the Surgeon General places a label on every pack of cigarettes warning of the dangers of smoking. Smoking can also be bad for the quality of air inside your home by elevating particulates and chemical pollutants.\n\n- Use exhaust fan while cooking\u2014Get rid of particulates generated by cooking with a true exhaust fan that moves air at a rate of 100 cubic feet per minute (CFM). This will help improve the air you breathe.\n\n- Use bathroom exhaust fan\u2014Personal care products are rich sources of particulates: hairsprays, gels, perfumes, colognes, and deodorants are all examples of products we use that often emit particulates. Make sure the fan vents to outside.\n\n- Wash bedding frequently\u2014Wash bedding frequently in hot water of at least 140\u00b0F to get rid of dust mites that are found in sheets, blankets, pillows, and pillowcases.\n\n- Limit indoor flame sources\u2014Burning wood in stoves and fireplaces is a frequent\n\nsource of indoor air pollution if not properly vented.\n\nChemical Pollutants\n\nChemical pollutants\u2014also known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs)\u2014arrive in the home's air from many different sources. Some of these are easy to eliminate. For instance, most people store a lot of house cleaning products in their bathrooms and the kitchens. Reducing the number of cleaning products and choosing \"greener\" alternatives will help reduce indoor air pollution. Other ways to reduce chemical pollutant sources include:\n\n- Choose soy- or beeswax-based candles whenever possible. They are more expensive, but generally emit lower levels of VOCs. Scented room fresheners should be used as little as possible due to the high VOC levels they emit.\n\n- Seal door between house and garage\u2014Most people store an assortment of chemicals, petroleum products, old paint cans and other items in the garage. The fumes from these storables can be drafted back into the house and recirculated throughout. If these items cannot be moved to a shed or well-ventilated space, store\n\nthem in a sealed container.\n\n- Use bathroom exhaust fan\u2014Personal care products are rich sources of VOCs: hairsprays, gels, perfumes, colognes, and deodorants are all examples of products we use that emit VOCs. Make sure the fan vents to outside.\n\nCarbon Dioxide\n\nWe breathe oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. A high level of carbon dioxide is often described as \"stuffiness.\" Unlike carbon monoxide, there is no immediate danger with high levels of carbon dioxide. Instead, home occupants might experience fatigue, yawning, and lack of concentration. Fresh air is a solution to high levels of carbon dioxide. Use adequate ventilation to lower carbon dioxide levels.\n\nTemperature\n\nWith the proper equipment, you can achieve the desired temperature levels in a home.\n\n- Use a programmable thermostat\u2014Make sure that you have a modern programmable thermostat and set it to a temperature that is comfortable for the whole family. A programmable thermostat automates temperature setbacks while you're not at home, which can lead to significant energy savings.\n\n- High efficiency furnaces and air conditioning units also play a major role is delivering consistent comfort at a lower cost while reducing your carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy-efficient homes maintain a consistent seasonal temperature and lower monthly utility bills.\n\nHumidity\n\nRelative humidity (RH) is important for comfort and safety inside your home. Low humidity can lead to nose bleeds, electrical shocks, and feeling colder than the temperature indicates. High humidity makes you feel uncomfortable and can also have health effects if RH levels rise above 55% indoors.\n\nAbove 55%, dust mites and cockroach populations thrive. Mold growth can be an additional complication in a high humidity environment when RH is sustained above 60% for long periods of time. Don't use wood fires or overheat your home to mitigate low humidity.\n\nProgram your thermostat to maintain longer A\/C run times\u2014Your A\/C system can reduce humidity levels with longer run times. Air conditioning not only provides cooling, it removes air humidity.\n\nInstall humidifiers or dehumidifiers if there are chronic issues.\n\nCarbon Monoxide\n\nCarbon monoxide is a clear, odorless, potentially deadly gas that is a by-product of combustion. To eliminate the possibility of carbon monoxide build-up in your home air: Inspect all gas appliances \u2014Make sure all gas appliances are properly vented and operating according to manufacturers' specifications. Verify that the pilot lights are lit.\n\nDo not operate propane stoves or barbeques indoors. Make sure car exhaust does not enter the home\u2014Homes with attached garages can experience unsafe carbon monoxide levels from car exhaust.

To avoid contamination, leave the garage door open for half an hour to ensure that the exhaust is not vented into the home"}
{"text":"In 1962, the publication of Silent Spring on the harmful impacts of DDT on animal and human health lit a spark among environmentalists and the general public alike to address industrial pollution. As the decade went on, teach-ins, TV shows, and various forums educated the public on threats the humans and the environment faced from pollution. Then in June 1969, the Cuyahoga river caught on fire (for the umpteenth time) due to oil slicked debris and pollution from decades of industrial waste. The flaming river was a powerful symbol of the costs of unchecked industrialization, and Americans demanded government action to clean up pollution.\n\nAt the end of 1969, President Nixon and Congress sprang into action to address public concerns on the environment. Congress passed the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that declared a national environmental policy, promoted efforts to protect the environment and public health, and encouraged deeper understanding of the threats humans and ecosystems faced.\n\n\"[C]onvinced that the 1970s absolutely must be the years when America pays its debt to the past by reclaiming the purity of its air, its waters, and our living environment. It is literally now or never.\"\n\nAs the year progressed, President Nixon decided that a new independent agency was necessary to coordinate the environmental work across the administration. On December 2nd, 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency opened with Assistant Attorney General William D. Ruckelshaus at the reins. By the end of the month, Congress had passed the Clean Air Act, giving the EPA the authority to establish national air quality standards, national standards for significant new pollution sources, and facilities emitting hazardous substances. With NEPA and the Clean Air Act as bookends to 1970, President Nixon and the 91st Congress paved the way for the vital health standards that protect Americans today.\n\nPresident Nixon set up the regulatory system that continues to protect us today. Notably, a Republican President was able to hear the public and take sweeping action to clean up our air and water, action that the anti-regulation Republican party of today repeatedly fights against.\n\nBut the reason that the U.S. doesn't make headlines for extreme pollution like China is that we continue to fight for public health with new and improved air quality standards. The EPA bases its rulemaking on the most current, best available science. As our knowledge grows about new and old pollutants alike, the EPA is legally bound to set new standards to ensure healthy environments surround our schools and workplaces.\n\nFor example, science in the last decades has proved beyond doubt that carbon pollution will be harmful for human livelihoods. In June 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia unanimously declared that the EPA is \"unambigously correct\" that the Clean Air Act requires it to regulate carbon pollution. As science evolves, our policies must as well. Our work is not over just because our air quality isn't as \"crazy bad\" China's.\n\nIn his second term, the Obama Administration has the opportunity to fight for public health standards through the reduction of carbon pollution and smog. Let's continue protecting Americans families and ensure they have safe environments to live, work, and learn now and in the future.\n\nArpita Bhattacharyya is Research Assistant to Distinguished Senior Fellow Carol Browner at the Center for American Progress.\n\n5 Responses to History Shows U.S. Can Tackle Pollution And Climate Change\n\nAt this time, we have an environmental health crisis that isn't climate change. It doesn't particularly help to say that China's public health crisis is worse, that the Orange Crush crisis in the former demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam is worse, that the DU crisis in Fallujah is worse, that the crises near Russia's nuclear lake and near Chernobyl are worse.\n\n200 years ago, and for 2000 years before that, the incidence of cancer was 1 in 1800 people. A child born today has a 1 in 2 chance of dealing with cancer in her\/his lifetime. Some types of cancer such as breast cancer prey particularly on the upper middle class and the rich, so these things should be everybody's concern.\n\nWe're also dying of an epidemic of diabetes and heart attacks, which are partly caused by (greedy, corrupt) manufacturers enticing us into eating terrible food, partly caused by bad exercise habits and partly caused by the stress of a crazy, 20% unemployment life.\n\nThe endocrine disruptors and GMO chemicals in our food, food packaging, household chemicals, construction chemicals, pesticides, on and on, are causing many epidemiological problems beyond cancer. I would say that the majority of us will be bumped off early, mainly because of greed.\n\nYes, and at the same time a lot of these \"issues\" are thought to be \"ok\" because of overpopulation. But in fact we decrease the overall chances of species survival. We face a genetic bottleneck with climate chaos"}
{"text":"Sour gas flare in Louisiana's Barataria Bay.Shortly before Hurricane Katrina's winds and waters inundated Mississippi's coast, the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) had pushed to open Mississippi waters to natural gas drilling and production. Though the prospect was rebuffed by widespread public opposition from Mississippi residents and citizen groups like the 12 Miles South Coalition, this threat to the health of Mississippi's coast resurfaced this past December. MDA issued draft rules that would regulate any seismic testing or mineral leasing in State waters. The final rules were published in February of this year, but are currently on hold due to the lawsuit filed by Gulf Restoration Network and Sierra Club. You may be familiar with many of the arguments against offshore oil and gas drilling along Mississippi's coast\u2014i.e. the impacts on tourism, the heightened risk of pollution, or the potential harm to coastal barrier islands. Resistance to drilling and production however also includes a seldom-discussed yet serious issue: the release of hydrogen sulfide gas.\n\nHydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a naturally occurring component of natural gas. Commonly referred to as \"sour gas,\" H2S can be emitted routinely or accidentally during the oil and gas extraction process. Because H2S cannot be sold, it is usually flared (or burned) as a safety measure. The combustion of H2S results in the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2), but in the event of incomplete combustion, H2S can also be released into the atmosphere. Releases also occur when the flare intended to burn the H2S goes out, and instead H2S is vented directly into the air. The risk of H2S emissions is an issue worth discussing because according to the EPA and other credible sources, H2S poses a significant health risk. In serious instances exposure to H2S is life threatening, but even occupational or accidental exposure can be harmful. For example, the inhalation of H2S in low concentrations can cause migraines, eye and skin irritation, nausea, and respiratory infection. EPA has also found that due to its toxicity, H2S can also cause significant adverse effects in aquatic life.\n\nNatural gas production platforms off the coast of Dauphin Island. The two on the left are approximately 1.4 miles from the coast. Photo courtesy of Dr. Olivia Graves.The potential effects of offshore gas drilling and production in Mississippi waters have occasionally been compared to those on Dauphin Island, AL. A total of five platforms extracting natural gas surround Dauphin Island, a small barrier island in Mobile Bay. In addition to the platforms' aesthetic effect on Dauphin Island residents and visitors, the potential risk of a hydrogen sulfide release has become a reality. In fact, in 2007 ExxonMobil was responsible for an accidental release of 843 lbs. of H2S from their Mary Ann Field platform in Mobile Bay. Prior to this release, the community of Dauphin Island was not aware that such a danger existed. A local newspaper article describes the hydrogen sulfide emergency that day\u2014the entire island was affected by the sour H2S odor, dozens fell ill, and some were even taken to the doctor or emergency room.\n\nWhile its stench of rotten eggs is an obvious indicator, H2S rapidly desensitizes our sense of smell and other senses. Communities like those on Dauphin Island have thus invested in H2S monitors and mechanical detectors. Emergency and Rescue departments on Dauphin Island implemented H2S operational guidelines with procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to hydrogen sulfide emergencies. According to Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier, H2S is a \"major issue\" for the community. Early notification is essential, yet unfortunately the system for dealing with H2S \"isn't that great yet.\" Collier said that while residents and schools know (and even practice) the procedure in the event of an H2S emergency, they have also started posting bulletins in rental properties to warn and notify visitors of what to do in the event of a H2S release.\n\nSour gas flare in Louisiana's Barataria Bay.Part of the H2S emergency procedure on Dauphin Island includes getting inside as fast as possible, closing the windows and doors, and shutting off any air-conditioning units. Even if a similar procedure is put in place in Mississippi, how would this be achieved on a beach full of people enjoying a day on Ship Island? A charter boat full of visitors to the coast? If the release is severe enough to travel onshore, how fast can people get inside before inhaling a considerable amount of H2S? Dauphin Island has arguably adjusted to the landscape since offshore drilling was first brought there over thirty years ago. Nevertheless, the community is still at the mercy of the gas industry to keep them informed and safe.\n\nEarlier in my post I mentioned how SO2 is the product of burning and removing H2S from natural gas. SO2 emissions are regulated to a much greater degree than H2S (not to mention they've received a considerable amount of attention due to their feared ability to produce acid rain.) \"Unplanned\" releases of sour gas\u2014natural gas containing significant amounts of H2S\u2014are \"incidents\" and must be reported to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM). Most incident reports are triggered from the burning of sour gas longer for longer than 30 minutes or from burning more than 50 lbs. because this produces considerable amounts of SO2. In fact, some incident reports are filed because the facility has breached its allotted quantity of SO2 emissions for the month. In 2010\u2014one of their \"dirtiest\" years\u2014the Exxon Bon Secour Bay Platform reported over 180 of these incidents. At the Exxon Northwest Gulf Platform, 2009 was one of their dirtiest years, reporting 177 incidents or unplanned releases. While the total quantity of SO2 released can be calculated from these reports, there is no measure of the total H2S released. Furthermore, though under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA) platforms must report releases of \"emergency\" classified quantities of H2S, natural gas extraction facilities are exempt from other EPCRA requirements, such as gathering and reporting summarized data on the total amount of H2S released annually. This puzzling fact was confirmed by Kirk Chandler of the Alabama Emergency Response Commission.\n\nH2S releases are one of the many reasons to object to natural gas drilling off the Mississippi Coast, especially given the lack of transparency about how much H2S offshore natural gas production facilities actually release on a regular basis.

{"text":"A small new study has found that an antioxidant-rich diet could protect lungs from exposure to air pollution.\n\nAccording to Environmental Health News, the study published in the journal Epidemiology included 209 people who were admitted to London hospitals.\n\nResearchers from Imperial College in London found that asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients were more likely to be admitted to the hospital on days when there were high particulate matter levels outside. Such conditions can cause oxidative stress to the body, raising the risk of health problems such as heart attacks. They found that people who had higher levels of vitamin C in their blood were less likely than those with low vitamin C levels to go to the hospital on these high-pollution days.\n\nThe findings add to a small but growing body of evidence that the effects of air pollution might be modified by antioxidants.

{"text":"CARBON MONOXIDE KILLS-CHANGE YOUR CLOCKS, CHANGE YOUR BATTERIES\n\nEach year when we change our clocks to and from Daylight Savings Time, New Yorkers are encouraged to also take the time to change the batteries in their smoke detectors. In addition to your clocks and smoke detectors, you should also check and change the batteries in your CO detector. This year Daylight Savings Time ends at 2:00AM on Sunday November 6th. Like a smoke detector, a CO detector can save your life, but only if it's working.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, each year in the United States hundreds of people are killed as a result of non-fire related Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning associated with consumer products. It is the most common type of fatal poisoning in the United States. In addition, tens of thousands more will be treated in emergency departments as a result of accidental CO poisoning.\n\nCO is a commercially important chemical that is formed in many chemical reactions. However it is also deadly and is often referred to as the \"silent killer.\" It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, highly toxic gas produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels - gas, oil, coal, wood and other petroleum products used in boilers, engines, oil burners, gas fires, water heaters, solid fuel appliances and open fires. CO is also formed as a result of the decomposition of many organic materials.\n\nDangerous levels of CO can accumulate when, as a result of poor installation, poor maintenance, failure of, or damage to, an appliance in service, the fuel is not burned properly, or when rooms are poorly ventilated and the Carbon Monoxide is unable to escape.\n\n\"Carbon Monoxide can produce a wide range of effects on people exposed to concentrations as low as 50 parts per million,\" said Dr. Kausik Kar, MD Medical Director of the Hyperbaric Unit at Westchester Medical Center. \"Symptoms may range from mild headaches and dizziness to more serious symptoms including nausea, lethargy and even convulsions. Unfortunately many times the more mild symptoms are often attributed to illnesses such as the flu and left untreated, resulting in the more serious complications and even death. If you believe you have a CO leak in your home or that you are suffering from the effects of CO poisoning, leave your home immediately and call 911.\"\n\nIn addition people with heart or respiratory problems as well as infants, small children, unborn children and their expectant mothers are at an increased risk for suffering from the affects of CO poisoning at a much quicker rate than others in the household and they may be the first to show symptoms.\n\nWhile a CO detector may help to alert you to the presence of elevated CO levels in your home it is just as important to make sure that plumbing, heating and other gas powered equipment in your home is properly maintained and serviced regularly by a licensed professional. CO detectors are available locally in many different stores and can be installed in just a few minutes using only small hand tools.\n\nAMANDA'S LAW\n\nOn February 22, 2010, Amanda's Law went into effect in New York State.

{"text":"Author Archive\n\nIt has long been known that ultraviolet (UV) light used at sufficiently short wavelengths can break down microorganisms and render them sterile and unable to reproduce. It is a fact that has contributed to the widespread use of UV technology over the years for germicidal irradiation and sterilization applications.\nOne area where UV light-based technologies are being used increasingly is for residential air purification purposes. The air circulating inside a residential heating and cooling system can be concentrated with dangerous contaminants, allergens and even disease-carrying bacteria including those associated with the flu and H1N1. In fact, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, indoor air is 100 times more polluted than the air outside.\nA UV Air Treatment System can greatly reduce this pollution and help combat the flu, H1NI and other threats by preventing viruses, bacteria, mold spores and other allergens from growing and circulating within a Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. Ultraviolet irradiation can help sterilize up to 99.9% of mold and fungal spores on a HVAC system's cooling coils and close to 75% of airborne bacteria.\nA UV air treatment system works primarily by causing photochemical damage within a microorganism that renders them sterile and unable to reproduce. This effectively neutralizes the threat of their being able to multiply and thereby can be very effective in combating diseases such as H1N1 and the flu. Ultraviolet radiation techniques have been used for years to disinfect medical equipment and are considered to be a widely applicable means of air disinfection as well.\nSome UV air treatment systems are standalone units that use a fan to force air to move past a shielded UV lamp. But most UV air treatment units are installed directly inside forced air systems where UV generating lamps sterilize the air moving through it. Such UV air purification systems are typically mounted downstream of the air conditioner cooling coils as well as in the return air ducts, both of which are breeding grounds for mold and other bacteria.\nA UV light installed inside the main heating and cooling system is ideal because on average air is circulated between 75 to 150 times through a HVAC system daily. Since UV light cannot pass through metal or glass, a UV air treatment system installed inside a HVAC system also poses little risk of direct exposure to the eyes or the skin.\nFilters Fast filter experts are ready to answer any questions you have on installing UV systems.\n\n20\n\n11 2009\n\nFilters Fast is considering adding a new auto ship program for all of our filter lines and wanted to get feedback from consumers prior to implementing the system.

I USE A WHOLE HOUSE FILTER. TODAY WHEN I WENT TO CHANGE MY FILTER ONE SIDE OF IT HAD A GREEN GROWTH ON IT. IT WAS ON THE SIDE THAT FACED THE DOOR OF MY WELL ROOM. THE DOOR WAS LEFT OPEN WHICH HARDLY EVER HAPPENS. WHAT IS THIS?\nAnswer:\nWhat you have on your filter is Algae. Is there any sunlight reaching into the room? Normally sunlight will cause Algae growth. Now, how do you clean it? First discard the old filter. Before placing a new filter into the housing, clean the inside of the housing well with a water and bleach solution. Then replace the filter. After replacing the filter, run your water through a shower or something that uses a lot of water for 5-10 minutes to ensure that the bleach solution has passed through your pipes and your water is safe to drink.\n\n31\n\n05 2006\n\nQuestion: bought a house with a 7 filter system\u2026only label says springhouse and ecotech\u2026.what is this? where do i get replacement cartridges for it\u2026.does it also have to have a water softener inline with it? what is the electric plug on one of the cartridges do?? Answer:\nWe found the Users Manual for the system that is installed in your home and it can be found at \nThe plug appears to be for Ultra-Violet UV water filtration. UV Filtration is used to kill any bacteria present in water. They do not seem to make any claims to the effectivness of their system on bacteria and looking at the diagram of the the filter flow, it looks like the UV system may have some flaws. UV light can be blocked by larger particles in water. Since the filtration appears to have a 20 micron filter prior to the UV stage, any particles under 20 microns can enter the UV chamber and effectively protect bacteria by being between the UV light source and the bacteria. It seems like a better design would have the 1 micron carbon block filter prior to the UV chamber to remove all particles greater than 1 micron in size which would minimize the shadowing effect. Do not use this filter system with water that has been deemed unsafe for consumption. This system does not have a softener built in. If you have hard water, then you would need a seperate water softener to solve that problem. Replacement cartridges can be found from the manufacturer. Depening on the size of the cartridge, you may be able to use any brand of filter that meet the specifications.\n\n26\n\n03 2006\n\nI have a reverse osmosis system GXRM10G. Family of 2. How often should I change the postfilter sump and prefilter sump and should I change the RO cartridge at the same time?\nMost Revers Osmosis Filter Systems require pre and post filter changes at 6 month intervals to maintain peak performance. The membrane should be changed every 2 years or if you notice a significant drop in water passing through the reverse osmosis system. In your case the GXRM10G uses the FX12P pre and post filters which should be changed every 6 months and the fx12m membrane which should be changed every 2 years. The O-rings should be changed every other filter change on the pre and post filters and every change on the membrane.\n\n26\n\n03 2006\n\nMost people are not aware that after you change your refrigerator water filter, there are two additional steps that should be taken to properly complete the water filter change.\n\nStep 1: Reset your refrigerator water filter change light\n\nMost new refrigerators now come equipped with an indicator light that notifies you when it is time to change your water filter. This light does not automatically reset when you change your water filter and the light must be manually reset.\n\nHere is a list of refrigerator manufacturers and how to reset the filter change indicator light:\n\nAmana- Press and hold the Auto and Dispenser Lock buttons until the water filter status indicator light flashes. Frigidaire- Press and Hold the Reset Button Until the Indicator Light Flashes. GE General Electric- Press and Hold the Reset Button for around 8 Seconds. HotPoint- Press and Hold the Reset Button for around 8 Seconds. Jenn-Air- Press and Hold The Light and Lock Buttons until the Water Filter light flashes. Kitchen Aid- Press and Release the Light Button 5 times Quickly. Maytag- Press and Hold The Light and Lock Buttons until the Water Filter light flashes. Samsung- Press and Hold the Ice Type and Child Lock Buttons at the same time for 3 seconds. Whirlpool- Press and Release the Light Button 5 times Quickly.\n\nStep 2: Flush a couple of gallons of water through your new filter\n\nSince refrigerator water filters are made of carbon, some carbon residue is present in the first gallon or two of water. This will not harm you but may leave a bitter taste and residue in your water. If you continue to have these problems after flushing a couple of gallons through the filter, it is possible that you have a defective water filter.\n\nOnce these two steps are completed, you are all set to enjoy great tasting ice and water through your refrigerator. If you don't see your manufacturer listed or the instructions don't work for your model please post a comment with your make and model number so that we can provide exact instructions for your model."}

{"text":"Virginia's Air Resources\n\nLook up in the sky. Air seems boundless and, for that reason, it is a resource often taken for granted. Above the state of Virginia alone rests over one trillion tons of it. But, just like water, not all of it is usable to you. Yet even with all of this volume, air must constantly be reused. In fact, the air you are breathing now was in someone else's lungs earlier. Air is the ultimate recyclable material!\n\nQuestion: Since oxygen is always being used to burn food into water and carbon dioxied, why doesn't it all get used up?\n\nAnswer: Photosynthesis. Green plants use light and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. The use and reuse of oxygen is called the oxygen cycle.\n\nAir is a mixture of invisible and odorless gases, mostly nitrogen and some oxygen. Water droplets, fine particles, and small amounts of other gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, and argon are also part of the mix. If air is clean, we can neither see it, taste it, nor smell it.\n\nWhat is Air Pollution?\n\nOften what we can see or smell in the air is air pollution. Air pollution is any visible or invisible particle or gas found in the air that is not part of its normal composition. Some substances are so common and widespread, they build up in the air and become a hazard to human health.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has developed health-based national air quality standards for six pollutants. They are: carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and lead. In addition to these six criteria pollutants, standards have been set for over 120 toxic air pollutants (hazardous chemicals found in the air which are known or are suspected to cause cancer, genetic mutations, birth defects, or other serious illnesses in people even at low exposure levels). These contaminants include arsenic, benzene, beryllium, mercury, vinyl chloride, and radionuclides. Companies that produce such pollutants are required to use special equipment to control how much is emitted into the atmosphere.\n\nWhere Does Air Pollution Come From?\n\nAir pollutants have occurred naturally since the earth's formation. Particulate matter and gases are emitted from every corner of the globe: from volcanoes, tree pollen, forest fires, and decaying organic matter in oceans and wetlands.\n\nMuch air pollution, however, results from human activities - from burning coal, oil, wood, gasoline, and other fuels used to run factories, cars, farm and off-road vehicles, and construction equipment, and from power plants that generate heat and light for our homes and businesses. Burning these fuels produces smoke and gases (see chart on page 25.0). Smoke is made of tiny particles of soot and ash suspended in the air and called \"particulate\" matter. Sawdust from lumber mills, rock dust from quarries, and soil particles from bare earth are other examples of man-made particulates found in the air.\n\nOnce particulates are added to the air, they can chemically react to form pollutants that are even more dangerous. For example, when nitrogen oxides and chlorine interact with hydrocarbons in the presence of sunlight, ozone is formed. When it is formed at ground level, it acts as a powerful respiratory irritant that makes it hard for people to breathe, can damage lung tissue, and make respiratory ailments worse. High levels of ozone -- which means over 0.12 parts per million in an hour or over 0.08 ppm over 8 hours --, are frequently found in urban areas during hot summer months. When this happens, you are likely to hear a \"Code Red Ozone Alert.\" Reading almost as high may cause an \"air quality advisory\" or Code Orange Alert. Though very infrequent, there have been Code Purple Ozone Alerts which are more severe than Code Red.\n\nThis is in sharp contrast to the ozone you may be most familiar with. That ozone, which exists in a layer found in the upper atmosphere (or stratosphere), provides a protective barrier against harmful radiation from the sun.\n\nJust What is Ozone?\n\nGround-level ozone, the main ingredient of smog, is a colorless gas formed by the reaction of sunlight with vehicle emissions, gasoline fumes, solvent vapors, and power plant and industrial emissions. Ozone formation is most likely in hot, dry weather when the air is fairly still. Ozone pollution is one of the most serious problems in Virginia's urban areas. Symptoms felt include shortness of breath, chest pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing. Children, people with respiratory disease, and individuals who exercise outdoors are at particular risk from high ozone levels. It can make these problems worse, send people to the hospital and can even damage lung tissue.\n\nAlways On the Move\n\nPollutants of any sort can ride the air currents for long distances. Some of Virginia's pollution is carried in from sources in the Midwest, especially large coal-fired power plants. Air can \"cleanse\" itself to some degree by such processes as rain; otherwise dense, poisonous clouds would already cover the earth. Sometimes the weather does not permit this cleansing to happen, and the air stagnates due to a weather condition known as an inversion.\n\nNormally, as you go higher up in the air, the temperature gets colder. Hot polluted gas from cars or smokestacks rises through the cooler air above and blows away. Sometimes a layer of warm air forms above the cooler air below (often in a valley like Roanoke or Charlottesville). When this inversion happens, the polluted air will rise up to the warm layer and then stop. In this way, a giant cloud of pollution can form over a community.\n\nWhile the air may be cleansed after a good rain, many of the chemicals and small particles washed from the atmosphere become land or water pollution. In fact, scientists have estimated that as much as 25-30 percent of the nitrogen pollution in the Chesapeake Bay is a result of acid deposition. While \"normal\" rainfall has a pH of about 5.5, precipitation in Virginia can be up to ten times more acidic, ranging from 4.3 to 4.5.\n\nWhat Are the Effects of Air Pollution?\n\nAir pollution is dirty and it is expensive. More important, polluted air can make healthy people cough and wheeze. For people who are sick or especially ensitive, air pollution may worsen an existing condition and mean discomfort, limited activities, increased use of medication, and more visits to doctors and hospitals. A growing body of scientific studies suggests that air pollution has long-term effects on the lung's ability to function and contributes to the development of lung disease.\n\nOur noses and sinuses have a built-in filtration system that traps large dust particles before they get into our lungs. And human lungs have a natural defense system that helps to protect us against some of the air pollutants breathed. But people respond differently to air pollution and very small particles are not filtered out. How people respond, or their level of risk, depends on several factors, including the amount of pollution in the air, the amount of air breathed in a given time, and their age and overall health.\n\nINNOVATIONS AT THE MT. STORM POWER STATION\n\nVirginia Power is getting into the pollution prevention act by using smokestack scrubbers to help reduce acid rain. At the Mt. Storm Power Station in West Virginia, smokestacks will be fitted with scrubbers that are expected to remove 95% of the sulfur dioxide from the smoke created by burning coal. (Sulfur oxides can mix with moisture in the air and become a component of acid rain.) The process works through a chemical reaction called neutralization when calcium in limestone, a base, mixes with sulfur dioxide, an acidic gas in the smoke, and creates calcium sulfate or gypsum. Some of the gypsum will be used to reclaim acidic water at mines near the plant. Virginia Power expects each of the scrubbers to remove about 55,000 tons of sulfur dioxide a year. This pollution prevention method is not only cost-effective for the power company, but also benefits air quality around the plant (including the Shenandoah National Park).\n\nJust What is Acid Rain?\n\n\"Acid rain\" is really rain, snow, or fog that contains sulfuric or nitric acid. Acid rain, or \"deposition,\" forms when water vapor mixes with sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Sulfur and nitrogen come from natural sources like volcanoes, but are common by-products of the combustion of fossil fuels (coal and petroleum), which are burned principally to heat homes and generate electrical power. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides released during burning usually travel many miles before falling to the ground as acid rain. Acid is a measure on a pH scale ranging from 0, which is severely acidic, to 14, which is extremely alkaline, or basic. A value of 7 is neutral. Lemon juice has a pH of 2; baking soda, 8; a cola drink, 4; and pristine rain is about 5.6. Natural precipitation is about ten times less acidic than the average value of rainfall in Virginia - 4.3 (extremely acid). However, pH can vary from week to week (and rainstorm to rainstorm) from 3.5 to 5.0. Acid deposition levels in Virginia are comparable to other areas of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the U.S.\n\nEffects of Acid Rain\n\nSulfuric acid in the air can hurt the lungs of infants, children, and adults. It can contaminate drinking water by dissolving minerals from soil and pipes which are then carried into the water supply. Acid rain has been blamed for damaging trees and mountain streams in Virginia and the northeastern United States. High acidity levels can kill new fish eggs. Airborne nitrogen oxide is also believed to be responsible for an estimated 30 percent of the nitrogen pollution entering the Chesapeake Bay. Excessive nitrogen and other nutrients in the Bay overstimulate algae growth, thereby reducing the oxygen levels available for other plants and fish.\n\nScientific studies performed in the early '90s confirm that initial estimates of the national damage caused by acid rain were overstated. However, central Appalachian region ecosystems are severely stressed by acid deposition due to the low neutralizing capacity of local soils. The physical and chemical properties of these soils are such that they cannot buffer, or offset, the acid. This region of the state unfortunately receives a high rate of deposition of sulfur compounds from power plants in the Midwest.\n\nWhat Can Be Done?\n\nManaging air is a complex undertaking because it is a substance constantly on the move. Air is affected by sunlight, dust particles, water vapor, and wind currents-factors which by their very nature are also moving.\n\nWhen it comes to air pollution, technology has served as both a culprit and a cure. Devices used to control pollution from smokestacks and exhaust vents include:\n\nThe cyclone - a system where heavy dust is spun right out of the air.\n\nThe electrostatic precipitator - which uses static electricity to attract dust particles, in the same way that a comb picks up bits of paper after being charged with static electricity by your hair.\n\nThe scrubber - which uses a water spray to wash dust and gases from the air.\n\nThe filter system\/bag house - which works like a vacuum cleaner bag to collect dust.\n\nSome emissions are pre-treated before being released. For example, some power plants spray a limestone slurry (a mixture of limestone and water) to neutralize the acid resulting from burning coal. Catalytic converters that help decrease emissions from automobiles are another example.\n\nOf all the types of pollution, odors are probably the hardest to control because we can smell even tiny amounts of so many substances. (The nose is a great piece of monitoring equipment!) A new technology called biofilters actually uses bacteria to \"eat\" odors.\n\nWhat Are Those in Government Doing About Air Pollution?\n\nThe U.S. Congress passed important federal air pollution laws, known collectively as the Clean Air Act (1963; and amended in 1967, 1970, 1977, and 1990). National air quality standards spelled out how clean the outdoor air has to be, and it is up to each state to see that its air meets these standards.\n\nIn 1966, the Virginia General Assembly passed the Virginia Air Pollution Control Law. The regulations are administered and enforced by the Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nSome of the goals of the new Clean Air Act Amendments are listed here:\n\nReduce hazardous pollutant emissions within 10 years.\n\nDecrease urban smog by reducing emissions from small businesses as well as large factories and vehicles.\n\nReduce emissions from electric utilities in two stages by the year 2000: ten million tons of sulfur dioxide, and two million tons of nitrogen oxide.\n\nBoth new and existing sources of toxic pollutants that are identified as subject to Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) will be expected to reduce emissions by 90% or more.\n\nIn Virginia, the Department of Environmental Quality works closely with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to monitor and evaluate hazardous air pollutants across the state. A computer model that estimates concentrations of 185 hazardous air pollutants statewide helps pinpoint regions of most concern. Data is collected every three years and added to the model and allows better evaluation of the state's air pollution strategies.\n\nVirginia is working to achieve the requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act, a federal law amended by Congress. One provision, Title IV, calls for reductions of sulfur dioxide of approximately ten million tons per year and two million tons of nitrogen oxides per year. Virginia's power plants are preparing to take steps necessary to reduce nitrogen oxides. Most of the reductions in pollutants will occur at large coal-fired power plants in the Midwest. Some of these individual plants emit more than all the sources in Virginia combined. Emissions fromthese large plants are released from very tall smokestacks and travel eastward, sometimes hundreds of miles, before returning to Earth in precipitation or dust.\n\nPrevention is Key\n\nLike so many other forms of pollution, the surest solution to air pollution is prevention. This means many things. It means wise transportation and community planning. It means adopting new processes and materials for industrial operators. It means each person doing their share by conserving the resources they use, particularly electricity and gasoline.\n\nFundamental Learnings Related to Air\n\nAir is one of the physical or abiotic (nonliving) factors that influence living organisms.\n\nThere are two main types of air pollutants: primary and secondary. Primary pollutants are those emitted directly into the air, such as smoke and chemicals (particulates, oxides of nitrogen hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide). Secondary pollutants are produced from the chemical interactions of primary pollutants with other atmospheric compounds. Examples are smog, acid rain, and ozone.\n\nParticulates are small particles such as dust or soot that contribute to air pollution. Natural processes such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions, as well as man-made processes such as burning coal or oil (fossil fuel), release air pollutants.\n\nBurning fossil fuels emits chemical by-products. These combine with moisture in the atmosphere to form acids, which fall as acid precipitation (rain or snow).\n\nAir pollution affects the health of lakes, forests, wildlife, crops, water supplies, and humans.\n\nOzone in the air we breathe damages our health while ozone in the upper atmosphere protects us from harmful radiation."}

We estimate that the mass of aerosols arriving at North American shores from overseas is comparable with the total mass of particulates emitted domestically. Curbing domestic emissions of particulates and precursor gases, therefore, is not sufficient to mitigate aerosol impacts in North America. The imported contribution is dominated by dust leaving Asia, not by combustion-generated particles. Thus, even a reduction of industrial emissions of the emerging economies of Asia could be overwhelmed by an increase of dust emissions due to changes in meteorological conditions and potential desertification."}

The major threat to clean air is now posed by traffic emissions. Petrol and diesel-engined motor vehicles emit a wide variety of pollutants, principally carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulates (PM10), which have an increasing impact on urban air quality. In addition, photochemical reactions resulting from the action of sunlight on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and VOCs from vehicles leads to the formation of ozone, a secondary long-range pollutant, which impacts in rural areas often far from the original emission site. Acid rain is another long-range pollutant influenced by vehicle NOx emissions. In all except worst-case situations, industrial and domestic pollutant sources, together with their impact on air quality, tend to be steady-state or improving over time. However, traffic pollution problems are worsening world-wide. Below is an introduction to the principal pollutants produced by industrial, domestic and traffic sources:\n\nPOLLUTANTS MEASURED IN TORBAY\n\nNITROGEN DIOXIDE (NO2) Nitric oxide (NO) is mainly derived from road transport emissions and other combustion processes such as the electricity supply industry. NO is not considered to be harmful to health. However, once released to the atmosphere, NO is usually very rapidly oxidised to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is harmful to health. NO2 and NO are both oxides of nitrogen and together are referred to as nitrogen oxides (NOx).Nitrogen dioxide can irritate the lungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections such as influenza. Continued or frequent exposure to concentrations that are typically much higher than those normally found in the ambient air may cause increased incidence of acute respiratory illness in children.\nPARTICLES (PM10) Fine Particles are composed of a wide range of materials arising from a variety of sources including:\ncombustion sources (mainly road traffic);\nsecondary particles, mainly sulphate and nitrate formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and often transported from far across Europe;\ncoarse particles, suspended soils and dusts (e.g. from the Sahara), seasalt, biological particles and particles from construction work. Particles are measured in a number of different size fractions according to their mean aerodynamic diameter. Most monitoring is currently focussed on PM10, but the finer fractions such as PM2.5 and PM1 are becoming of increasing interest in terms of health effects. Fine particles can be carried deep into the lungs where they can cause inflammation and a worsening of the condition of people with heart and lung diseases. In addition, they may carry surface-absorbed carcinogenic compounds into the lungs.\n\nAir quality is measured by comparing against a range of health-effects based standards. This page gives information about what this means.\n\nAir Quality Standards and Objectives\n\nStandards for air pollution are concentrations over a given time period that are considered to be acceptable in the light of what is scientifically\n* not included in regulations at present + AOT 40 is the sum of the differences between hourly concentrations greater han 80 \u00b5g m-3 (=40ppb) and 80 \u00b5g m-3, over a given period using only the 1-hour averages measured between 0800 and 2000. Shaded data shows new objectives\n\nAir Pollution Information Service\n\nIndex and Bands\n\nIn the UK most air pollution information services use the index and banding system approved by the Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollution Episodes (Carbon MonoxideSignificant effects may be noticed by sensitive individuals and action to avoid or reduce these effects may be needed (e.g. reducing exposure by spending less time in polluted areas outdoors). Asthmatics will find that their 'reliever' inhaler is likely to reverse the effects on the lung.\n\nVery High\n\n10\n\nThe effects on sensitive individuals described for 'High' levels of pollution may worsen.\n\nBoundaries Between Index Points for Each Pollutant\n\nBand\n\nIndex\n\nOzone\n\nNitrogen Dioxide\n\nSulphur Dioxide\n\nCarbon Monoxide\n\nPM10 Particles\n\n8 hourly or hourly mean*\n\nhourly mean\n\n15 minute mean\n\n8 hourly mean\n\n24 hour mean\n\n\u00b5gm-3\n\nppb\n\n\u00b5gm-3\n\nppb\n\n\u00b5gm-3\n\nppb\n\nmgm-3\n\nppm\n\n\u00b5gm-3\n(Grav.

{"text":"More from this Member\n\nReduce Indoor Air Pollution with Houseplants!\n\nPosted Aug 11 2010 10:27am\n\nby kiwilog\n\nWe've been thinking about indoor air quality a lot lately at KIWI. (See Editorial Director Sarah Smith on Greenguard and Miele .) When trying to get rid of indoor air pollutants, we tend to think in terms of human behaviorHow can we adjust the way we construct and inhabit our indoor environments to avoid polluting them?but it turns out part of the solution is simply to bring the outdoors in.\n\nCommon houseplants can help remove pollutants from the air, according to a study published by NASA in the late 80s. Yes, that NASA. Even before the 70s energy crisis spawned the construction of low-ventilation, cheap to heat, and eventually, very polluted buildings, NASA was leading the world in indoor air quality research because they were particularly interested in the health effects of living in a sealed environment made of synthetic materials. Just as we were beginning to understand \"sick building\" syndrome, NASA was preparing for \"sick space station\" syndrome.\n\nThe basic premise of the finding is that plants 'inhale' some of the pollutants in the air, along with the carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis, and 'exhale' clean oxygen, acting as a filter. The houseplants NASA studied had the advantage of being tropical plants, which evolved in low-light environments and are therefore extra efficient at trapping gases. The astronauts put it best:\n\n\"Since man's existence on Earth depends on a life support system involving an intricate relationship with plants and their associated microorganisms, it should be obvious that when he attempts to isolate himself in tightly sealed buildings away from this ecological system, problems will arise. [...] If man is to move into closed environments, on Earth or in space, he must take along nature's life support system.\"\n\nThe study is admittedly a little vintage, and has yet to be followed up or replicated. However, those of us who talk to our orchids can confirm that houseplants will improve your indoor quality of life overall."}
{"text":"Carbon Monoxide\n\nCARBON MONOXIDE\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a clear, colorless, odorless, and insidious poison that is responsible for hundreds of inadvertent and preventable deaths in the United States each year. The major environmental source of CO is incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fossil fuels. The reason for its toxicity is that it combines with the oxygen-carrying site of hemoglobin, the red protein within red blood cells that is responsible for delivering oxygen from the lung to body tissues. CO has a more than two-hundredfold greater affinity for this oxygen-carrying site than does oxygen. This means that, at sea level, exposure to 1,000 parts per million (ppm) CO in 20 percent oxygen (200,000 ppm) would lead, at equilibrium, to about 50 percent of hemoglobin sites being combined with CO rather than oxygen. Fortunately, it requires eight to twelve hours for maximum blood levels to be achieved when the body encounters a new CO concentration, otherwise mainstream cigarette smoke, which contains even higher levels of CO, might be instantaneously lethal. When CO combines with hemoglobin, the resulting chemical is called carboxy hemoglobin (COHb).\n\nThe negative effect of CO on the delivery of oxygen to the tissues extends beyond just the simple blockage of oxygen-combining sites. Each hemoglobin molecule contains four oxygen-carrying sites. Once the first oxygen molecule is released at the tissue level the second, third, and fourth come off even more rapidly. Oxygen release is delayed by CO so that there is even less oxygen delivered than would be expected purely on the basis of the amount of oxygen not being carried by hemoglobin. For this reason, overt symptoms due to lack of oxygen can be observed at COHb levels of approximately 15 to 20 percent, or even less, in healthy people. Levels of COHb over 40 percent can be lethal.\n\nThe uptake of CO increases as respiratory rates increase. This puts children at greater risk since they breathe more rapidly, in proportion to their body weight, than adults. This explains the unfortunate situation of a family in an automobile stuck in a snowstorm with the motor running being found with the adults unconscious and the children dead. The fetus is also at higher risk due to the greater affinity of CO for fetal, as compared to adult, hemoglobin.\n\nAll cases of fatal CO poisoning are readily preventable. In addition to automobile exhaust, other lethal sources of CO are often related to home heating systems. Blockage of flues, or inappropriate repair work on the home heating source or on ducts, is often responsible for CO toxicity. Symptoms of CO toxicity, such as headache, weakness, and listlessness, tend to be worse in the morning and to go away during the day if people leave the home. Many fatal cases are preceded by visits to physicians or emergency departments with only symptomatic treatment. Home CO alarms are relatively cheap and are an effective means of prevention. CO poisoning occurs more rapidly at high altitude due to the relative lack of oxygen to compete for the oxygen-combining site of hemoglobin. Conversely, symptomatic CO poisoning is treated with oxygen.\n\nCO is also made in the human body through the normal catabolism of heme (oxygen-carrying hemoglobin), which leads to a background concentration in the blood of approximately 0.5 percent COHb. Concentrations of 2 to 3 percent COHb have been associated with an increased risk of angina attacks in susceptible individuals with preexisting arteriosclerotic heart disease. Preventing this adverse consequence is the major basis for the current U.S. ambient standard for CO. There has been a significant decline in outdoor CO levels in the United States as a result of decreased automotive emissions of carbon monoxide."}

{"text":"Air cleaners are among the fastest growing household products. Since the early 1990s, sales have tripled, and 14 percent of American households use them. In just 1999 alone, people in the United States spent about $350 million on portable air cleaners in hopes that they could take dust, pollen, tobacco smoke, and pet allergens out of the air.1 Though some indoor air pollutants can be removed with air cleaners, no air cleaner is designed to remove every type of airborne pollutant. Air cleaning is also never good enough by itself; the sources of pollution should always be controlled first along with good ventilation both in the home and in offices and schools.\n\nSome air cleaners are effective at removing dust and particles from the air. However, most air cleaners do nothing to remove gases or vapors. Typical furnace filters are designed to protect mechanical equipment and are not effective at capturing small particles capable of entering the lungs. People with allergies or asthma may want to upgrade standard furnace filters to higher-efficiency filters or electronic air cleaners. However, before going with a higher-efficiency filter, make sure the furnace has the horsepower to blow through this increased resistance.\n\nThree-Tiered System For Cleaner Indoor Air\n\nIn the search for clean indoor air, a three-tiered system is used:\n\nControl the source of pollutants at their source\n\nProvide adequate ventilation\n\nClean the air\n\nIf all sources of indoor air pollutants are controlled, then there is no need to have air cleaners; controlling the source of the pollutants is obviously the first thing you want to do. However, not all sources can be controlled. Sometimes pollutants get in no matter how hard you try to prevent them. Therefore, the last line of defense is the air cleaner. Because of that, it should always be used in addition to, not in place of, the other steps!\n\nOne study found that air cleaners could be beneficial for asthmatic patients with animal allergies who want to keep their pets when air cleaning is used in combination with other measures. This was after a three-month intervention with 20 asthmatic children allergic to animals who had pets at home. They found that the airways of those children who had air cleaners in their living rooms and bedrooms were not as reactive as the airways of those children who had fake air cleaners in their homes.2\n\nProtect the general well being of people: in order to do this, a much higher performing filter must be used. It might not always be possible to put high efficiency filters on older ventilation systems so this should be investigated before doing so.\n\nThe efficiency of a filter is the difference between an air cleaner and just an air filter. Air filters are less than 20 percent efficient at trapping or filtering out particles; air cleaners are more than 20 percent efficient. It is important to choose the right type of filter since not all air filters are equal. There are a wide range of filter sizes and thicknesses. The filter found in most home ventilation systems is a flat filter that is one-half inch to one inch thick. Though it is efficient in collecting large particles that might hurt equipment, it will not capture the particles that can be breathed deep into the lungs. Very small particles can be breathed deep into the lungs and cause health problems so high efficiency filters are needed to trap these small particles.\n\nOne of the best ways that a filter's efficiency is increased is by pleating it. Medium-efficiency filters (20 percent to 50 percent efficiency) are usually pleated. This increases the total area available for filtration and extends the life of the filter. These use static electricity created by airflow, but their effectiveness may decline as the static charge decreases over time.\n\nThe most efficient filters are High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. They can remove almost 100 percent (99.97percent) of all particles larger than 0.3 micrometers in diameter. Even though HEPA filters are expensive, they can be maintenance-free up to five years when used with a pre-filter. Most home ventilation systems do not have a powerful enough fan or horsepower to use this type of filter since these filters can be up to 36 inches thick (as compared to the one-half to one inch thickness of most furnace filters). A unit that is powerful enough to blow air through a HEPA filter also uses a lot of energy. Recently filters have appeared that call themselves \"HEPA-type\" filters that are less efficient (60 percent to 95 percent) but can run on a less powerful ventilation system.\n\nElectronic air cleaners:Electronic air cleaners are effective in removing airborne particles, but not gases. One major drawback to many of them is that they can produce ozone that may irritate the lungs.\n\nNegative ion generators: These give a charge to airborne particles so that they become attracted to and settle on walls, floors, tabletops, draperies, people, etc. Activity within a room, however, may stir up and release these settled particles back into the air. Some devices have a collector to pull the charged particles back to the unit. If a unit does not have a collector, then this kind of a unit can result in the soiling of walls and other surfaces.\n\nWhile ion generators may remove small particles (such as those in tobacco smoke) from the indoor air, they do not remove gases or odors. The odor of tobacco smoke is mostly due to gases in the smoke rather than the particles. So even if the particles in tobacco smoke are removed, you may still smell the smoke; and with over 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, many pollutants are still probably present. These units may also not do a good job at removing large particles, such as pollen and house dust allergens, since these large particles tend to settle quickly.\n\nElectrostatic precipitators: These give a charge to airborne particles and trap them on metal plates that are oppositely charged. These plates must be cleaned regularly for these units to be effective since their efficiency declines rapidly as the collector plates become coated with particles. Cleaning the plates should be done every few months, at least. When these units are built into a home or building's ventilation system, there is the advantage of cleaner ventilation equipment resulting in lower energy costs and performance that is more reliable. However, since these units can produce some ozone, you need to make sure that the unit does not emit more than the FDA limit of 0.05 ppm.\n\nAs long as the units are the correct size for the room and do not give off ozone, they can be effective. For example, in a study in two Swedish day care centers, the absenteeism rate of the children was recorded over three years. In the second year, electrostatic air cleaners were added. The amount of mold in the air decreased after four to five months and absenteeism rates fell by 55 percent.3\n\nSince many indoor air complaints are related to temperature complaints, one manufacturer came up with an air cleaner that also provides personal heating and cooling. This device uses an electrostatic filter to remove airborne particulates and includes a separate filter for volatile organic compounds(VOCs). The system has been designed to include a range of options such as controls for thermal comfort and lighting. The cooling mechanism operates without the use of CFCs and allows a user to lower the temperature at his or her work station by as much as 10\u00b0F or to raise it by as much as 25\u00b0F compared to the ambient temperature in the building.4\n\nAn advantage to these types of units is that there are no long-term filter replacement costs.\n\nThe drawbacks are:\n\nThey become less efficient with use\n\nThey require frequent cleaning\n\nThey can produce ozone\n\nThey can be expensive if installed into existing ventilation systems Mechanical-electronic hybrid filters are a combination of the two filters mentioned above. For example, an \"electret\" filter uses an electrically charged flat or pleated fabric to attract airborne particles.\n\nGas phase filters may be attached to air cleaning devices to filter specific gases, vapors, and odors since neither mechanical nor electronic filters can remove gases and odors on their own. These air cleaning units may be equipped with a chemical filter designed to removed pollutant gases from the air; activated charcoal is most widely used. Other substances used in these filters may include silica gel, activated aluminum coated with potassium permanganate (which is fairly effective in capturing formaldehyde from the air), zeolites, porous clay minerals, or molecular sieves. These filter materials may become quickly overloaded and need to be replaced often. As a result, these devices are more expensive to buy and maintain. Gaseous pollutant air cleaners are generally rated in terms of the total amount of a chemical that can be captured.\n\nStyles of Air Cleaners\n\nLike humidifiers, air cleaners also come in styles that are part of the central ventilation system, that are room console units, and that are tabletop units. Here are the advantages and disadvantages of each style:\n\nCentral filtration: These are air cleaners that are built into the home's central heating or air-conditioning system or a building's ventilation system. These are used when the air needs cleaning in an entire house or building. It may be difficult to add these to existing systems since a more powerful fan may be required to move sufficient air through some types of air cleaners. Another drawback is that the ventilation system must be running in order for the air to be cleaned. If you are having one of these systems installed, request one that has low-leakage, is easy to maintain, and is energy efficient. Be sure you go with a company or contractor that is very experienced in designing and installing central filtration systems.\n\nConsole-size units: These are often used when air cleaning is needed in a particular room. They have effective filters or collecting plates. When room units were tested, all of them moved more air then tabletop units. One study even found this type of unit with a HEPA filter effective in removing large pollen and spores.5 They usually work better when all the door and windows are closed and are usually the unit of choice if pollutants are confined to particular rooms.\n\nTabletop units: These units usually have limited airflow and inefficient filters. Most reviews have shown these units to be ineffective. In a 1200 cubic foot room, 12 units were tested for their effectiveness in removing cigarette smoke. Out of the 12 units tested, 9 of them reduced smoke levels by less than 24 percent compared with a 17 percent reduction when no unit was used at all!\n\n\"Personal\" air cleaners: These are units designed to be worn around the neck, on a lapel, or in a pocket. To begin with, they are very dangerous because they emit ozone right at the breathing zone; therefore, they can trigger health problems in people with asthma and others with lung problems. They also are ineffective. When Consumer Reports tested one in a test chamber in January 2000, they said that it \"barely reduced\" the particle concentration in the surrounding air.1 In another study by the California Air Resources Board in 1999, they found that both personal air purifiers they studied exceeded the Federal Drug Administration recommended limit of ozone as well as the World Health Organization eight-hour air quality guideline of 60 ppb. They recommended that these devices not be used anywhere near the breathing zone, especially by children and persons with asthma, other respiratory diseases, or allergies.6\n\nHouseplants: Houseplants are generally not effective at removing indoor air pollutants.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nThe overall effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on its ability to trap small particles and on the amount of air drawn through it. There are no industry-wide performance standards, but the Association of Home Appliances Manufacturers (AHAM) has developed the Room Air Cleaner Certification Program. This program provides a uniform standard for portable air cleaners called the clean air delivery rate (CADR). The CADR is the amount of clean air measured in cubic feet per minute (cfm) that an air cleaner delivers to a room. AHAM publishes a list of Certified Air Cleaners that meet the standards of the Room Air Cleaners Certification Program. The list contains the CADR ratings for removing dust, tobacco smoke, and pollen by brand name and model number of air cleaners. The CADR ratings vary greatly by the type of pollutant, as well as by brand and model number. For example, if you are concerned about removing pollen from the air (rather than tobacco smoke, for example) then you should choose an air cleaner that is certified by AHAM and has a high CADR for pollen.\n\nOzone Generators\n\nSome air cleaners (called ozone generators) use an electrical charge to generate ozone in an attempt to clean the air. This has been done for more than 100 years.7 Although ozone can be used in reducing odors and pollutants in unoccupied spaces (such as removing smoke odors from homes involved in fires), the levels needed to do this are much too dangerous to breathe. The levels of ozone produced by ozone generators sold as air cleaners are too low to clean the air and too high to be healthy. Scientific research has shown that low levels of ozone will not remove indoor air contaminants.7\n\nBefore buying any electronic air cleaner, find out if it has been tested for ozone production. Air cleaners that produce ozone are bad for people who suffer from asthma; for children; for the elderly; or for people with emphysema, bronchitis, or other respiratory diseases. Because of that, the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services urged people who have chronic respiratory diseases or compromised immune functions to immediately turn off any ozone-generating machine.8 Low amounts (above 0.08 ppm) of ozone can cause eye\/nose\/throat irritation, chest pain, coughing, nausea, throat irritation, and congestion. It may also worsen bronchitis, heart disease, emphysema, and asthma, and can make it harder for the body to fight off respiratory infections. Not only can ozone be toxic to human health, but it can also hurt indoor plants and damage materials such as rubber, electrical wire coatings, and fabrics and artwork containing certain dyes and pigments.\n\nContrary to the claims of some vendors, no agency of the federal government has approved these devicesfor use in occupied spaces, and the FDA has set a limit of 0.05 ppm of ozone in indoor air. Even when one follows the manufacturer's instructions, some studies have shown that the ozone concentrations produced by ozone generators can be higher than this 0.05 ppm limit. Because of misleading information being given to people about these machines, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has even taken legal action against some manufacturers of ozone generating machines to prohibit them from making unsupported claims about the ability of the machines to clean air or to provide health-related benefits. In 1995, one manufacturer told the FTC they would stop making health claims about their ozone generators, but they continued to make the claims; the FTC sued them in 1997. The case went to court and the manufacturer was found guilty in November 1999 of making unwarranted claims. The manufacturer promised an \"intense effort\" to modify its sales pitch after that ruling. Within days of the ruling, a representative from that same company sold 11 ozone units to 6 Ohio school districts. Two of these ozone devices were sold to elementary schools after telling them that the machines would help \"kill\" widespread fungal infestations in their old schools. An injunction was files against them by the FTC in January 2000 to force them again to stop making these claims.9\n\nIf you are thinking about buying an air cleaner:\n\nFind out what kind of filter may be the best for you.\n\nTry renting a device and see if any health problems, such as allergies, improve.\n\nBecause larger units are noisier than smaller units are, just buy the size of unit you needfor the size of room you need to clean.\n\nWhen using an air cleaner:\n\nInstall room-size units in rooms where you spend most of your time or have the worst symptoms.\n\nLocate the units as close as possible to any identifiable pollution source\n\nLocate the unit away from doors, windows, and foot traffic, but not close to walls, corners, furniture, or other obstructions. This is so that air may easily reach the air cleaner.\n\nAir cleaners should always be used and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nThe most important things to know about air cleaners are:\n\nThey cannot be used by themselves to clean the air. Pollutants have to be controlled at their source, and indoor air has to be well ventilated.\n\nAir cleaners have to be well maintained. Dirty air filters, for example, are not going to help you clean the air.\n\nBuy the right size of unit for the space you want to clean. The airflow should be sufficient to exchange the air in the room five or six times per hour; therefore, the size and efficiency of the filtering device should be determined in part by the size of the room. Do not waste your money buying models that sit on a table or hang around your neck.\n\nMake sure the unit you buy does not emit more than 0.05 ppm of ozone.\n\nReferences\n\nParker-Pope T.

{"text":"How to Fight Indoor Air Pollution\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, sensational media headlines on toxic mold created an unprecedented public awareness of indoor air quality. Now, public concern is moving beyond mold to a wide range of other indoor air contaminants, creating new challenges and potential liabilities for property owners.\n\nLong the province of office properties, indoor air quality is fast becoming a residential concern and a major legal and public policy issue for residential property owners. In fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has ranked indoor air pollution among the top five environmental risks. The EPA also says that because people spend up to 90% of their time indoors, indoor air pollution may pose a greater threat to health than outside pollution.\n\nDefining Pollutants\n\nNew concerns over indoor air quality involve the numerous household products that release potentially dangerous gasses, or particles, into the air. The most common are tobacco smoke, pesticides, carbon monoxide and the volatile organic compounds that release gasses and are used in paints, cleaning products and even cosmetics. Health problems believed to be linked to indoor pollutants include asthma, headaches and dizziness, as well as eye, nose and throat irritation.\n\nAs with mold, the science surrounding indoor air pollutants is still evolving. Because individuals can react differently to indoor air pollutants, depending on their sensitivity and the duration of the exposure, there are generally no standards indicating when most indoor air pollutants are dangerous enough to merit action by a property owner. A notable exception is radon, for which the EPA has established permissible exposure levels.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is that indoor air is invariably influenced by outside pollution sources, such as automobile and industrial emissions, pollen counts and ozone levels. It also is influenced by everything from cooking to routine cleaning to \"off-gassing\" from rugs, furnishings and wall coverings.\n\nSeveral building-specific factors also influence indoor air quality. They include the materials used in construction, how the property's HVAC system is maintained and operated, the building's ventilation, air flow rates, and design. And, as with mold, the actions and behaviors of a building's residents can make a difference.\n\nManaging the Problem\n\nWhile only a few states currently regulate indoor air quality, many others have proposed legislation. To help owners protect themselves from this emerging issue, the National Multi Housing Council and National Apartment Association have published a members-only white paper titled \"Beyond Mold: Managing Indoor Air Quality.\"\n\nFor each major indoor pollutant, the document reviews existing federal and state legislation as well as litigation and insurance trends. The white paper (available at  also recommends specific steps owners can take. For instance, it suggests apartment firms consider adopting a \"no-smoking\" policy and provides a list of practical considerations involved in going smoke free.\n\nTo guard against carbon monoxide leaks, owners should inspect gas appliances and be sure to have central heating systems inspected and cleaned annually by a trained professional. Residents also should be educated about the dangers of idling their cars in attached garages.\n\nWhen it comes to pesticides, owners should ensure maintenance personnel are trained to properly mix, use, store and dispose of these products. Be sure that products are only used in well-ventilated areas and, when possible, schedule pesticide applications for periods when residents are off the property. Only apply pesticides in targeted locations, with minimum treatment of exposed surfaces and keep track of all pesticides and other chemicals used. Similar precautions are urged for products that include paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints.\n\nNo single federal agency directly addresses indoor air quality, and existing regulations cover only indoor air quality on a piecemeal basis. For instance, the EPA indirectly regulates indoor air quality through the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nBecause there is no consistent regulatory approach to the regulation of indoor air quality, property owners need to educate themselves to avoid future problems and potential litigation.\n\nAlex Hecht is a legislative analyst for the Washington, D.C.-based National Multi Housing Council and its joint legislative partner, the National Apartment Association"}
{"text":"Vitamin C Reduces Effects of Harmful Air Pollution on Lungs\n\nA healthy dose of vitamin C may be able to fight off the effects of air pollution, according to a new study. (Photo : Wikimedia)\n\nA healthy dose of vitamin C may be able to fight off the effects of air pollution, according to a new study. Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables seems to be good for the lungs.\n\nResearched found hospital patients who suffered from asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in London had low level of vitamin C. Their risk for breathing problems also increased when air pollution levels were high.\n\nThe study was included 209 patients between 2008 and 2010. Most of the patients were between ages 54 and 74, though some were as young as 18. Many of them were also former smokers.\n\nShare This Story\n\n\"This study adds to a small but growing body of evidence that the effects of air pollution might be modified by antioxidants,\" said Michael Brauer, an environmental health scientist at the University of British Columbia in Canada.\n\nSome of these antioxidants include vitamin C, found in many fruits and vegetables. These antioxidants may protect the body from free radicals, which are harmful molecules that damage cells. Free radicals form when air pollution enters the lungs. This can potentially lead to heart disease, cancer and even respiratory illnesses.\n\nThe antioxidants bind to free radicals and counteract them before they cause damage.\n\nThe researchers paid particular attention to course particulate matter levels. This is produced through the combustion of fossil fuels. The course particulate matter comes from car exhaust and power plants.\n\nThe study showed that lung conditions increased as course particle matter increased. The researchers found that with every increase in course particulate matter of 10 micrograms per cubic meter (mcg\/m3), there was a 35 percent increased risk of hospital admission for people with asthma or COPD.\n\nFor those who had low levels of vitamin C, the risk of being admitted to a hospital was 1.2 times greater.\n\n\"The protective effect of vitamin C was still present after excluding smokers and elderly subjects, implying that the effect of this antioxidant was not explained by smoking or age,\" Study researcher Cristina Canova said.\n\nSmokers and elderly patients have lower levels of nutrients than those who didn't smoke.\n\nThose who are concerned should include things such as citrus fruits, broccoli, and spinach in their diet as they are good sources of Vitamin C.\n\nResearchers are not yet sure if this link between Vitamin C and respiratory diseases still holds true for those who don't already have the diseases"}
{"text":"Indoor Air Quality\n\nOne question we get more than any other is how air conditioning and heating systems will impact the indoor air quality of our Pittsburgh area customers' homes. More often than not, the addition of heating and cooling systems to a home will have very little direct impact on the presence of pollutants and debris in the air, but with the right additions, we can help you reduce those unwanted particles.\n\nIndoor Air Quality Problems\n\nIn most regions, outdoor air quality isn't a terribly big issue, so when people move indoors they don't think about all the unwanted irritants that can build up when doors and windows are sealed up during the winter and summer months. But, indoor air quality can be severely dampened by the presence of pollens from household or outdoor plants, dander from pets, as well as dirt and dust, not to mention potentially harmful mildew and mold.\n\nAnd just because you cannot see them does not mean there are no airborne bacteria or viruses floating around in your home, waiting to be picked up by a member of the household. Boehmer Heating & Cooling strives to provide the utmost in comfort and safety to our customers. That's why a good indoor air quality system is vital to protect you and your family.\n\nWhere Air Quality Problems Come From\n\nThere are a variety of sources for the numerous pollutants in your home. To start with, during the cold winter months and hot summer months, you likely have the doors and windows sealed tight to guard against the loss of heat or cool air. So, the natural build-up of things like pet dander and dust will become worse due to a lack of air circulation.\n\nOutside pollutants can build up as well. These include leaking toxic gases from a furnace or stove or leaking through ductwork that has not been properly sealed. That in particular is something we see all too often. Without proper ventilators exchanging indoor and outdoor air regularly and filtering what you breathe, it's impossible to maintain a safe, healthy environment.\n\nManaging Indoor Air Quality\n\nA number of different air filtration and purifying solutions can help you reduce the impact of pollutants in your home's air. Different systems perform differently with each type of pollutant. For example, an effective purifier is good at removing natural particles like pet dander and pollen, while a filter may be better suited for detecting and removing particles like smoke. Other filters are specially crafted to kill bacteria and viruses using UV germicidal lights as the air passes through them.\n\nBeyond filtration and purification, don't forget the value of regular maintenance and cleaning of your air systems. Air conditioning and heating ducts are one of the most common sources of pollutants in a sealed home and this is something that can be avoided largely by keeping them clean. We provide maintenance to check for leaks, clean dirty AC coils and generally ensure the safety and well being of your family's air supply.\n\nWhatever your needs, know that Boehmer will be there to help you select the best possible solutions for your indoor air quality.

Outdoor temperatures have dropped drastically. Inside, you turn up the heat and pull out the space heaters from the back of the closet. You face (and attempt to prevent) the reality of the cold season: Dry, patchy skin, respiratory infections, nose, eye and throat irritation, the flu and miserable colds. We know it is the season for infections, but what's less apparent are the invisible and infectious monsters that could very well be thriving in our homes.\n\nThe culprit: Humidity levels that are perfect breeding grounds for pathogens. Experimental studies on airborne-transmitted viruses, dust mites and infectious bacteria show that the survival and infectivity of these organisms are minimized by exposure to indoor relative humidity ranging from 45-55%.\n\nHere's a graph that shows what happens outside that optimal range:\n\nWe can see the relationship between indoor relative humidity and adverse health effects. For example:\n\nHumidity affects the rate of out-gassing of formaldehyde from indoor building materials, the rate of ozone formation, and the rate of formation of acids and salts from sulfur and nitrogen dioxides.\n\nCareful management of indoor relative humidity is clearly a key factor to maintaining healthy indoor air quality. Just like the need to ensure that e-coli, botulism, insect parts and other junk is kept out of our food supply, you can craft and manage your own perfect pathogenic valley of death, resulting in a healthier, more comfortable home and work environment.\n\nA simple rule: Keep indoor humidity between 45 \u2013 55%, the safe range where air-borne transmitted pathogens, mites and fungus die before they can get (in)to you.\n\nNext up: How to measure and manage indoor relative humidity in the real world."}

This is certainly not the first of these advisories to be issued this summer and it won't be the last. In fact, it's possible we could see them for the rest of the week based on the current forecast.\n\nCode Orange means that the air is \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups,\" including those with respiratory problems under normal circumstances (asthma, lung disease, etc.) and active adults and children and the elderly. The Health Department urges everyone to reduce time spent outside and limit prolonged exertion, reduce trips and carpool and limit idling, and schedule outdoor activities in the morning and evening, avoiding the hottest part of the day. In addition, you can conserve energy but raising the thermostat slightly, turn off unused appliances and lights, and close the blinds or curtains so that less air conditioning is required to cool your home, all in an effort to reduce pollution.\n\nWhy are we seemingly under more Code Orange alerts the past couple of years? It isn't entirely because the air is worse... the federal government recently (2008) changed the air quality standards, requiring stricter compliance and cleaner air. Therefore, code orange actually requires lower ozone levels than it used to - thus more alerts for the same ozone levels!\n\nFor more information on ozone and air quality, visit the following links:"}

{"text":"Although emissions have steadily declined, more than nine million tons of pollutants continue to be emitted into the air each year in France as a result of human activities (industry, automobiles, domestic activities, agriculture, etc).\n\nThese pollutants consist primarily of sulphur and nitrogen oxides (SO2, NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), ammonia, particulate matter, metals and carbon monoxide (CO). Some of these pollutants are transformed in the atmosphere, producing other pollutants such as ozone and acid compounds.\n\nOver the past 20 years, regulations concerning fuel quality, motor vehicle emissions and emissions from industrial activities and combustion plants have led to a dramatic reduction in atmospheric emissions of a large number of pollutants, including sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOC), lead and heavy metals.\n\nSince the 1980s, SO2 emissions have dropped by 85% and NOx emissions by 39%. Since the 1990s, emissions of VOC have decreased by 40%, those of total suspended particulates by 8%, and those of lead by more than 96% (widespread use of unleaded gasoline). (CITEPA data).\n\nHowever, these efforts must not be relaxed since air pollution has not been eliminated and, in certain circumstances, regulations call for the implementation of alert measures (restrictions on driving and certain industrial activities) to avoid the occurrence of pollution peaks.\n\nIn the past, industrial activities and domestic combustion sources were the principal causes of air pollution in our regions. The situation has changed significantly in the last 20 years as a result of the decrease in these activities and the increase in traffic and the number of automobiles.\n\nMoreover, much of the energy used in France today comes from electronuclear sources. The responsibility for emissions of pollutants varies depending on the different areas of activity. For example (source CITEPA) :\n\nThe primary source of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in France is motor vehicle traffic (approximately 48% of emissions);\n\nWith regard to sulphur dioxide (SO2), emissions from fixed combustion sources such as fuel oil- or coal-based thermal power plants are declining most dramatically (more than 90% of emissions);\n\nApproved air quality monitoring associations (AASQA) continuously monitor the presence in the ambient air of 13 pollutants regulated by European directives and national legislation. These regulations include thresholds that may not be exceeded in the ambient air, as well as information and alert thresholds. The following pollutants are targeted by these provisions :\n\nOther specific pollutants in the ambient air for which no standards exist (formaldehyde, persistent organic pollutans, ammonia, odours, etc.) are also the subject of studies and monitoring campaigns on a case-by-case basis. These pollutants are governed by emissions regulations.\n\nCalculation devices used to assess air quality and develop forecasts at the national and local levels.\n\nIn accordance with the French \"Loi sur l'air\" clean air act, ADEME is responsible for the technical coordination of this monitoring system. It also administers a database that contains all the observations of the various AASQAs.\n\nAir quality indices calculated daily based on four pollutants in 140 population clusters\n\nIn addition to the measurements taken of each pollutant, an ATMO index and several air quality indices are published daily by the approved air quality monitoring associations in order to provide summary information on the average air quality representative of the population cluster as a whole (background urban pollution).\n\nThese indices are calculated for some 140 population clusters, 58 of which have more than 100,000 inhabitants, based on concentrations in the air of the following four regulated pollutants :\n\nnitrogen dioxide,\n\nsulphur dioxide,\n\nrespirable suspended particulates (PM10)\n\nand ozone.\n\n100,000 inhabitants, based on concentrations in the air of the following four nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, respirable suspended particulates (PM10) and ozone.\n\nIt is not possible to live without breathing and an average adult inhales a total volume of approximately 15 cubic metres of air per day. Monitoring air quality is therefore necessary not only to ensure good health, but also to protect our environment and the earth's climate, which is threatened by a rise in temperatures stemming from greenhouse gas emissions. The air that we breathe comes from the various places that we frequent on a daily basis (outside air, work place, home, car and other means of transportation, and so on). In addition to preserving outside air quality, we must therefore also consider the air in enclosed spaces where we could spend a large portion of our time (sometimes more than 80%).\n\nAn average of one year of life lost by each European as a result of air pollution\n\nScientific data show that the most serious health effects attributable to air pollution are caused primarily by exposure to background pollution (for example, average pollution throughout the year) rather than pollution peaks.\n\nIn Europe, it is believed that a person's average life expectancy can be reduced by nearly one year (average: -9.6 months) as a result of lifelong exposure to air pollution based on the PM2.5 indicator (airborne particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers). Source INVS and APHEIS European study.\n\nOn average, French motorists emit 2.5 times the weight of their automobile in carbon dioxide (CO2) and one-half of their own weight in miscellaneous pollutants each year\n\nOn average, French people travel 15,000 km per year by car. They emit an average of 2.5 times the weight of their automobile in carbon dioxide (CO2) and 40 kg of miscellaneous pollutants. However, by using a vehicle that meets the latest anti-pollution standards (Euro 4 which took effect on 1 January 2005), they will emit only 16 kg\/year of pollutants. (Source: Impact software, ADEME).\n\nStill, among the most environmentally-friendly means of travel are walking or cycling, whenever practicable.\n\nToday, 500,000 industrial or agricultural facilities which could potentially pose risks or generate pollution are subject to legislation governing facilities classified for the protection of the environment. Of these facilities, 61,000 are subject to an authorisation system (individual decision prior to the start of the activity which stipulates the operating conditions with which the establishment must comply), and the others to a simple reporting system. Inspectors of classified facilities, who come under the authority of the Minister for the Environment (via the department's prefect), are responsible for researching requests for authorisation and overseeing and monitoring the facilities. They work at :\n\n- The Regional Directorates for Industry, Research and the Environment (DRIRE) for most of the industrial establishments, - The Departmental Directorates for Veterinary Services (DDSV) for agricultural establishments, slaughterhouses, etc., - The Technical Department of the Inspection of Classified Facilities (STIIC).\n\nIndustrial facilities, and in particular facilities classified for the protection of the environment, are required to report their air emissions to the French authorities once a year (EPER register, various circulars) and to comply with maximum airborne pollutant levels.

There is no known safe level of lead in the body.\n\nThe agency has identified three areas in Tennessee, Arizona and New York as \"unclassifiable,\" meaning that available information is insufficient to confirm whether or not the areas are meeting the standards. EPA will take further action once additional information is available.\n\nIn October 2008, EPA strengthened the nation's air quality standards for lead ten-fold to 0.15 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air. EPA also finalized requirements for new monitors to be located near large sources of lead emissions. EPA designated areas as meeting or not meeting the standards in two rounds. Using air quality data from existing monitors, EPA completed the first round of designations in November 2010. This second round relies on data from the new monitors to classify the remaining areas.\n\nLast year, EPA designated 16 other areas in 11 states as not meeting the standards because their 2007 to 2009 air quality monitoring data showed that their emissions were above the agency's health-based standards. Based on new air quality monitoring information, and recommendations from Pennsylvania, EPA is expanding the size of one of those areas, Lower Beaver Valley, Pa to ensure that the entire area that exceeds the standard is properly identified.\n\nAreas designated as not meeting the standards will need to develop plans within 18 months and implement them within five years to reduce pollution to meet the lead standards. No areas in Indian Country are being designated nonattainment.\n\nNational average concentrations of lead in the air have dropped 93 percent nationwide since 1980, largely the result of the agency's phase-out of lead in gasoline.

The release of harmful organic compounds was cut, the company said, by three-quarters between 2008 and 2011.\n\n\"We have cut emissions by two-thirds since 2003 and we are working on further reduction \u2026 However, problems with air quality continue in winter, especially when weather inversion comes,\" \u010cern\u00e1 Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1 said.\n\nAs well as industrial plants, households that burn coal, traffic and pollution from neighboring Poland are also blamed for poor air quality.\n\nScientists have found that Ostrava residents have show physical signs of being affected by the pollution, with higher levels of expression of a gene called XRCC5, which is involved in repairing damage to DNA, the genetic material.\n\nThe researcher who led the study, Pavel R\u00f6ssner, head of the laboratory of genomics at Prague's Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, said the effects of the pollution were particularly severe for children.\n\n\"There is no higher incidence of lung or other cancer in this region, but the lifespan is shorter. It's about five years shorter than the average of the Czech Republic. Maybe people die before they have the chance to develop cancer,\" he said.\n\nHe said the effects of pollution on lifespan could be long-lasting, with life expectancy in other parts of the country that have seen improvements in air quality, such as north Bohemia, for example, still depressed.\n\nAlthough Ostrava and the surrounding area remain more polluted than the average for the country, some long-term observers believe things have improved significantly and that the city's perception as being dirty is outdated.\n\nPetr Van\u011bk, a chief of staff for Member of the European Parliament Ev\u017een To\u0161enovsk\u00fd when he was mayor of Ostrava and later governor of Moravia-Silesia, and who was born and brought up in the city, said visible pollution used to be much worse.\n\n\"Thirty years ago, when there was fresh snowfall, it turned gray and black within hours.

It has improved 95 percent.\"\n\nWith concerns remaining, however, over levels of fine particulate matter in particular, which can enter the bloodstream and lead to heart disease and lung cancer, and carcinogenic organic substances, campaigners say more must be done.\n\nCompanies, including ArcelorMittal, last year began applying for European Union grants that would fund efforts to reduce emissions from plants.\n\n\"In case the European Commission allocates subsidies, the projects will be implemented by 2015.

{"text":"Frequently asked questions.\n\nIndoor Air Qualiy\n\nGeneral\n\nHow can I improve my indoor air quality?\n\nThere are five basic strategies for outsmarting indoor air pollution:\nIdentify the problem\n\nThe first step toward better indoor air is to identify the types of pollutants present in the home. The best way to do this is to schedule an in-home air-quality test with your local Lennox dealer. Reduce concentrations of particles and bioaerosols\n\nRoutine cleaning and housekeeping helps reduce indoor air pollutants, but these simple fixes are not cure-alls. Some contaminants are so small that they may escape through the vacuum or never land on a surface. Lennox HEPA filtration systems, electronic air cleaners, high-efficiency air filters capture even the smallest of particles and bioaerosols. Reduce or eliminate chemical vapors and odors\n\nChemical vapors and odors can come from many different sources inside and outside the home. Once inside the home, these potentially toxic pollutants circulate through the ductwork, entering every room and living space. A Lennox air purification system removes and destroys 50% of household chemical vapors and odors within 24 hours. Ventilate Your Home Control Temperature and Humidity\n\nImproper humidity levels and high temperatures can actually increase concentrations of particles and bioaerosols. Lennox ComfortSense 7000 Series Touchscreen Thermostats regulate moisture levels and temperatures to improve indoor air quality and enhance comfort.\n\nTo determine which indoor air quality system best meets your needs, contact your local Lennox dealer quality products are right for you, contact your local Lennox dealer.\n\nWhat causes indoor air pollution?Health ConcernsThe Dave Lennox Signature Collection PureAir air purification system cleans the air better than any other single system you can buy. It's the only indoor air quality product that removes all three sources of contaminants (particles, bioaerosols and odors). And it's the only product that combines air filtration and purification capabilities into one integrated system.\n\nWhat is Indoor Air Quality?\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), your exposure to air pollutants can be up to 100 times higher indoors than outdoors. The American Lung Association estimates that most people spend 90% of their time indoors, so clean indoor air is very important.\n\nThere are several everyday steps you can take to reduce the pollutants circulating in your home, including:\n\n1. Store household cleaners, paint solvents and chemical products in tightly sealed containers. If possible, keep them outdoors.\n2. Clean and vacuum at least once a week.\n3. Regularly wash bed linens and stuffed toys.\n4. Keep windows closed when pollen, pollution and humidity levels are high.\n5. Ask you local Healthy Climate dealer to test the air in your home for dust, pollen, chemicals and other pollutants (data is evaluated by an independent testing agency).\n6. Make sure your home is properly ventilated. (Modern homes are well insulated and sealed to conserve energy, which means airborne pollutants have no way to escape).\n7. Keep humidity levels within a healthy, comfortable range to prevent growth of mold and mildew (25% - 55%).\n8. Avoid using scented deodorizers and odor-masking air fresheners, which may cause toxic chemicals.\n9. Have your HVAC system regularly inspected to make sure it is clean and in good operating condition.\n10. Choose furnishings that emit the smallest possible amount of chemical vapors.\n11. Do not allow smoking inside your home and make sure all gas appliances are properly vented.\n\nHow do I know which indoor air quality product is right for me?\n\nLennox offers air quality systems for a variety of different needs. To determine which system is best for your home, you need to consider the cause, or pollutant source, as well as your sensitivity. Consider the source\n\nPollutants are present in most homes, but the classification and concentrations of these contaminants vary. New homes tend to have higher concentrations of chemicals, while older homes are breeding grounds for mold and mildew.\n\nThe most effective measure for chemical vapors is the PureAir air purification system. For particles and bioaerosols, Lennox electronic air cleaners are a good choice. Consider your sensitivity\n\nThe effects of pollutants on a person's health can also vary tremendously. A healthy adult may require a simple solution like a one-inch MERV 8 filter. An elderly person with respiratory problems, on the other hand, may require a PureAir system for the reduction of triggers and irritants. microbiocideAccording the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), indoor air is two to five times more polluted than outside air. Given the fact that most people spend 90% of their time indoors, the EPA has ranked poor indoor air quality as one of the top five environmental risks.\n\nPollutants in your home's air can cause poor indoor air quality, which may cause dizziness and headaches, plus aggravate allergies and asthma\u2014itThe PureAir system reduces concentrations of pollutants through a process called photocatalytic oxidation (PCO). Similar to the process used by the Department of Defense to combat germ warfare, PCO combines nature's three most powerful air purifiers:\n\n1. The pleated media filter captures particles and bioaerosols like pollen and pet dander, removing them from the airstream.\n2. As the odor- and chemical-filled airstream flows over the UVA light, the airstream is exposed to the catalytic surface (titanium dioxide-coated mesh filter).\n3. The light energy activates the catalyst, which generates hydroxyl radicals. These particles, which are more than twice as powerful as chlorine, break down the odors and chemicals into carbon dioxide and water.\n\nWhat kind of pollutants does the PureAir system remove?\n\nThe PureAir air purification system is unique in that it is the only indoor air quality system that removes all types of pollutants:\nParticles:Pollen, dust mites, dirt, pet dander\n\nParticles are any substances measuring less than 100 microns in diameter. The Environmental Protection Agency has found that small particles (less than 2.5 microns) are responsible for the health effects of greatest concern.\nBioaerosols:Bacteria, viruses, mold spores, fungi\n\nBioaerosols are microscopic organisms that grow and multiply in warm, humid places. Exposure to these organisms can occur in even the most well-maintained living environments.\nOdors\/Chemicals:Pet odors, cooking fumes, tobacco smoke, perfumes, chlorine, cleaning supplies, paints, solvents\n\nOdors and chemicals are air contaminants in the form of gases. Classes and concentrations of chemicals found in a home are largely determined by air circulation, product usage and types of furnishings.\n\nAre all air filters created equal?\n\nThere are several factors to consider when choosing a filtration system, starting with sensitivity to allergens. The more sensitive a person is to allergens, the greater the need for a high-efficiency filtration system. Efficiency\n\nThe efficiency of the air filter should be a top consideration. Efficiency is based on the size of the particles captured by an air filter\n\nHigher filter efficiency not helps clear the air, but it also improves airflow. Generally, the more efficient a filter is, the less airflow reduction there will be. Cost\n\nCost is another major factor\u2014both in terms of the initial purchase price and expense of maintenance and upgrades. Purchasing a filter of reasonably high quality can save you money over the long term. Inexpensive filters may not provide the level of filtration you need and may also require frequent filter replacement. Solutions\n\nAmong the many filtration systems available are pleated filters, which are constructed of fiberglass or synthetic fibers woven into a more dense material. The pleats are arranged in V-shaped forms to increase the area of the filter material without increasing the face area. This increases the particle-holding capability.\n\nGermicidal lights use intense ultraviolet light to sterilize surfaces. Each solution removes particles, bioaerosols and chemicals, depending on the size of the allergen.\n\nElectronic air cleaners (EACs) High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are alsoCarbon monoxide can be an invisible threat to your family's health and safety. Though more commonly associated with fires and automobile emissions, carbon monoxide poisoning can accumulate in any home unless certain precautions are takenCarbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that is produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels such as wood, natural gas, gasoline, diesel, kerosene, coal and charcoal. It is caused by lack of oxygen or a disruption in the burning process.\n\nHousehold appliances such as your furnace, water heater, stove, space heaters, charcoal grill and gas dryer can be sources of carbon monoxide, especially if they are not in good working condition or have been installed improperly. Vehicle exhaust fumes from attached garages, as well as improperly operating fireplaces, also can become carbon monoxide hazards, particularly if your home is well-sealed for energy efficiency.\n\nWhat are some of the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning?\n\nUnfortunately, the symptoms are easily overlooked because they are often flulike. With mild exposure, most people experience headaches, fatigue and nausea. Medium exposure can cause a severe throbbing headache, drowsiness, disorientation, confusion and an accelerated heart rate. Extreme exposure can lead to unconsciousness, convulsions, cardiorespiratory failure, coma and possibly death.\n\nWhat can be done to protect our home from the dangers of carbon monoxide?\n\nThere are several measures you can take to The same holds true for lawn mowers or snowmobiles. Never use ovens or grills for heating devices\n\nCarbon monoxide detectors are most effective when used in combination with preventive maintenance. For more information on how to schedule regular maintenance for your furnace or about purchasing a carbon monoxide detector, contact your local Lennox Dealer.\n\nVentilation\n\nHow can I eliminate odors? quality products are right for you, contact your local Lennox dealer.\n\nWhy is ventilation important for proper indoor air quality?\n\nAt one time, it was possible to achieve natural ventilation in our homes by merely opening a window. However, with the concern for energy efficiency in recent years, we have been busy making homes \"tighter\" from an energy standpoint. Armed with weather stripping and caulk guns, we have eliminated air leaks from our homes. Unfortunately, that means contaminants have no way to escape.\n\nPollutants in your home's air can cause poor indoor air quality, which in turn may cause dizziness and headaches, plus aggravate allergies and asthma. That's why Lennox offers ventilation systems that help remove contaminants by exchanging stale, recirculated indoor air with fresh, filtered outside air.\n\nHow can I ventilate my home without losing energy?\n\nIt is now possible to exchange stale indoor air with fresh outdoor air without compromising the energy efficiency of your home. Heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) and energy recovery ventilators (ERVs) exchanging stale, recirculated indoor air with fresh, filtered outside air, and no energy is wasted.\n\nHRVs and ERVs are electronically powered units that circulate air throughout your home using the existing forced-air system or specially installed ducts. These units pump stale air out of your home and replace it with an equal volume of fresh outside air. An HRV is a compact unit that conditions the temperature of the outside air, while an ERV is a packaged unit that conditions both the temperature and humidity of the outside air. Because these units condition the air before it enters the home, your energy costs remain stable.\n\nHow can I provide fresh air exchange?\n\nA heat recovery ventilator (HRV) uses virtually noise-free fans that draw in fresh, cool outdoor air, while removing stale, heated indoor air. An energy recovery ventilation (ERV) performs the same function, but utilizes a rotary energy recovery wheel. In both cases, the units transfer the temperature and moisture properties from one air stream to the other, without allowing the two airflow streams to mix. Both units offer easy access for change of filters and necessary maintenance, making them not only energy efficient but also easy to use.\n\nHow do I determine if a heat recovery ventilation (HRV) or energy recovery ventilator (ERV) is right for me?\n\nIf you're wondering whether you need to clear the air in your home, you might ask yourself these questions:\n\nWhen was your home built? If your home is new, chances are it was built \"tighter\" to be more energy efficient. This may mean concentrations of air pollutants in your home could be a concern.\n\nHave you upgraded your home to be more energy efficient? If so, it may need an additional source of ventilation.\n\nHow often throughout the course of a year can you comfortably open your windows? Due to cold winters and hot summers, it is not always possible to have your windows open year-round. This means that you may not always have a constant controlled source of ventilation.\n\nDo odors tend to linger in your home? If this is the case, it is a sign of poor ventilation. There isn't enough air being circulated throughout the home to dilute unwanted odors.\n\nYour home comfort should include products and accessories that improve indoor air quality. Your family's health and comfort should be priorities, and working together, we can help you provide your family with a breath of fresh air.\n\nWith central heating, people are confined indoors with unnaturally dry air for many months each year. Humidifiers help to keep comfortable levels of moisture in the air, which is essential for your respiratory health.\n\nWhole-house humidifiers work like old-fashioned room humidifiers: They put moisture into the air, making harsh, dry air easier to breathe. And whole-house humidifiers use water mists instead of hot steam, which keeps the entire house at the desired humidity level\u2014no more carrying a humidifier from room to room in the winter.\n\nHow much water does a humidifier use?\n\nDepending on the model you choose and the size of your home, a humidifier uses from 1.5 to 12 gallons per day when the furnace is operating. This minimal amount of water is enough to raise the humidity to your desired level, but not enough for you to notice a difference on your water bill.\n\nHow do I know which humidifier is right for me?\n\nThere are a few factors you should take into consideration when purchasing a humidifier for your home: Size\n\nA humidifier's capacity, or the amount of moisture it can dispense in a given time, should match your particular household's needs. The capacity is measured as gallons per day of operation. One method that is used to determine the correct-size humidifier for your home is multiplying the total floor area in square feet by the ceiling height. Cost\n\nConsider not only the purchase price of the unit. but also the operating and maintenance costs. Some models consume more energy than others, so choosing a model that is right for your home and budget is extremely important.\n\nRegular maintenance is necessary to keep your humidifier in top working condition.\n\nDry air in your home can make your throat feel dry and cause or aggravate respiratory ailments.\n\nThe American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that you maintain a household humidity level between 30 and 60 percent. During extremely cold weather, your home loses humidity to the outdoors and the level may drop to as low as 10 percent. A humidifier adds moisture to your indoor air and can help relieve ailments related to dry respiratory membranes. Health Concerns\n\nOne Other Concerns\n\nDryInstalling a humidifier is simple if you are replacing your furnace. But you can also have a humidifier fitted to your current system with minimal labor, since it is designed for installation in your ductwork. It is also important to properly maintain your humidifier to avoid potential bacterial growth. Periodic cleaning and draining of the reservoir is strongly recommended.\n\nLack of humidity in a home can be the cause of numerous respiratory ailments. Improper moisture levels can cause dryness in the membranes of the nose, throat and bronchial tubes. Respiratory infections, repeated attacks of winter colds and airborne infections can also stem from inadequate humidity. How a humidifier helps\n\nFortunately, there's an easy way to your home environment healthy and comfortable. All you have to do is install a whole-house humidifiers, which puts moisture into the air, making harsh, dry air easier to breathe. Water mist instead of hot steam is used, keeping the entire house at the desired humidity level.\n\nA humidifier uses from 1.5 to 12 gallons of water per day\u2014just enough to raise the humidity to the desired level, but not enough to make a difference on the water bill. And because a humidifier is installed in the ductwork, there is no need to carry one from room to room. How to select a humidifier\n\nThere are many factors to take into consideration when selecting a humidifier, starting with size. A humidifier's capacity, the amount of moisture it can dispense, should match a household's needs. The capacity is measured in gallons per day of operation.\n\nIn terms of cost, consider the purchase price of the unit, as well as operating and maintenance costs. Some models consume more energy than others, so choosing a model that is right for your home and budget is extremely important.\n\nAlso, regular maintenance is necessary to keep your humidifier in top working condition. Installing a humidifier is simple when also replacing a furnace. But a humidifier can also be fitted to a current system with minimal labor since it is installed in the ductwork."}
{"text":"Good Air and Bad Air.\u2014The air of a closed room with many occupants is different in a number of ways from fresh outdoor air. The people in the room, by their breathing, have taken oxygen out of the air and given off into it carbon dioxide. Gas flames or lighted lamps also cause a decrease of oxygen and an increase of carbon dioxide. In the air of a crowded, poorly ventilated room, moreover, there is almost always a stale smell, which the people in the room may not notice after they have become used to it, but which any one coming in from outside notices at once. This smell comes from the mouths and bodies and clothes of the people.\n\nThe human body gives off not only carbon dioxide and these ill-smelling substances, but also heat and moisture. On the average, each person produces about as much heat as a candle flame; and the lungs and the skin together give to the atmosphere about three pints of water a day. If there were a candle burning in every seat in the schoolroom, the room would soon get warm; and so it does when there is a child sitting in each place, unless the heat is somehow carried away.\n\nBoth the heat and the moisture given off by the body are greatly increased by exercise, since the muscular work produces more heat, and the sweat glands form more perspiration to keep the body cool. It has been shown that a vigorous walk may cause an increase in heat production of i000 calories and an increase in evaporation of 800 grams. After a hard game, you generally want a drink of water to make up for the water lost in this way.\n\nThe Effect of Chemical Substances in the Air on Health.\u2014It used to be thought that the air of a crowded room was bad because of its lack of oxygen and excess of carbon dioxide. Men who go down into mines or deep pits in the ground sometimes die because of lack of oxygen, just as a candle goes out in a closed space. This danger never arises, how-ever, in an ordinary room even when it is most crowded. Oxygen and carbon dioxide pass easily through cracks and even through walls and ceiling where there are no visible cracks, and there is never so little oxygen or so much carbon dioxide in a room as to harm any one.\n\nThe odors in the air of a close room are unpleasant, and experiments indicate that stale air has an unfavorable effect upon the appetite. It is important for the sake of health and decency that the air of schoolrooms and living rooms should always be kept fresh and free from unpleasant odors.\n\nThe Effect of a Warm Atmosphere on Health.\u2014The worst thing about the air of a close room is its heat and, sometimes, its excess of moisture. A crowded, badly ventilated room is almost always a hot room, since human bodies produce heat and moisture as well as carbon dioxide. In such a room, the blood vessels in the skin expand and the blood goes to the surface of the body to cool off, as may be seen by the flushing of the face. The body temperature rises, the pulse goes up, and the blood pressure falls. As the blood moves to the outer surface of the body, the brain and other inner parts are robbed of blood, and one feels dull and listless and has little desire to work or play. In studies made by the New York State Commission on Ventilation, it was found that men did 15 per cent less work at 750, and 37 percent less work at 86\u00b0, than at 68\u00b0.\n\nPeople who live in overheated rooms are likely to catch cold and to have other illnesses. In such people, the mucous membranes of the nose are constantly congested (filled with blood and lymph), as the blood vessels dilate to keep the body at the proper temperature. As a con-sequence, these membranes\u2014instead of shrinking and drying promptly, as they should, when they come in con-tact with cold outer air\u2014lose their quickness of response and stay moist and swollen after the blood vessels them-selves have contracted; this makes them an excellent breeding place for bacteria. ' People who have been weakened in this way are very sensitive to the cold air and are easily subject to chills. Benjamin Franklin once said, \"People who live in the forest, in open barns, or with open windows, do not catch cold, and the disease called a cold is generally caused by impure air, lack of exercise, or from overeating\"; and he was right.\n\nThe Value of Moving Air.\u2014There is a great difference in the effect of still air and moving air, even when the general temperature is the same. The body is constantly giving off heat, and if the air is quiet, the portion close around the body will soon get much warmer than the rest, as if the body were surrounded by a kind of blanket of hot moist air. A wind breaks up this layer and brings fresh cool air to the body all the time; this is why it is so much more comfortable outdoors, or with an electric fan running, than in a closed room with still warm air.\n\nEffects of Cold Air.\u2014Moderate cold is a good thing for the body. It deepens the breathing, stimulates the blood vessels, and makes one feel active and vigorous\u2014if the cold is not too great and does not last too long. Excessive cold is as bad, however, as excessive heat. Unless well wrapped up, it is dangerous for those not specially \"hardened \" to it to sit down or lie still in a room that is really chilly. Drafts, or local currents of cold air, on a particular part of the body seem to be especially harmful. It is most unwise to sit or stand in a cool place after you have been exercising hard and are flushed and moist with perspiration.\n\nChilling the body makes it less able to resist disease. If there happen to be germs of any kind in your nose or throat, the weakening effect of a chill may be just enough to give them a chance to grow and cause illness.\n\nEffects of Atmospheric Humidity.\u2014From what has been said in the last chapter, it will be obvious that on a hot moist day we feel more uncomfortable than on a hot dry day, because moisture interferes with the cooling effect of the evaporation of perspiration. At low temperatures the effect of moisture is quite different. When the air is cool, little perspiration is formed, and its evaporation is a small factor compared with the direct cooling caused by the cold air. This direct cooling will be favored by a humid atmosphere, since moisture collecting in the clothing increases its power of conducting heat. So it is a curious fact that humidity in the air makes a hot day hotter and a cold day colder.\n\nHot moist air is found in very crowded rooms and in certain factories, but most of our rooms in winter are hot and dry. The warmer the air is, the more moisture it can carry, and when we raise the temperature of cold air from outdoors to 60\u00b0 or 70\u00b0 without adding any moisture to it, it will become relatively much dryer or more ready to take up moisture.\n\nWatching the Thermometer.\u2014Unless children are provided with especially warm clothing, such as is used in open-air rooms, a temperature between 65\u00b0 and 68\u00b0 is generally right for 'the classroom. Every schoolroom and every living room should have a thermometer in it. It is a good plan in the classroom to have a pupil appointed each week to act as Health Officer and keep a record of the temperature hour by hour. When the thermometer gets to 70\u00b0, the windows should be opened to cool the air; for when-ever the temperature is above 70\u00b0, the work of the children will be affected and their health is likely to be injured.\n\nDusts and Poisons in the Air.\u2014The ordinary fine dust in the air, which you can see as tiny flecks dancing in the sunbeam, does no harm. When a great cloud of dust is stirred up in sweeping, however, or when clouds of dust are whirled along by the wind in the street, there is real danger that any disease germs present may be carried and breathed into the nose or the mouth. This is why classrooms and corridors should never be swept when the children are in them. When you are on the street in a dust storm, keep your mouth shut so as to take in as little of it as possible.\n\nThe danger in breathing quantities of dust is not, how-ever, so much in the germs that the dust may contain as in the hard particles themselves, which may hurt the delicate lungs. Men who work at certain dusty trades, like steel grinding and granite cutting, easily fall victims to tuberculosis because their lungs have become injured by the inhaling of hard dust.\n\nIn other industries, such as white lead making and rubbing down paint, there are poisonous dusts or gases which may get into the air and do much harm. The only poison likely to be found in the air of houses is illuminating gas from leaking fixtures or from leaking or carelessly handled gas stoves. If there is the least smell about gas fixtures or stoves, or if the cocks are too tight or too loose, the gas man should be sent for; and great care should be taken not to leave cocks turned on unlighted or gas so low that it may blow out. A gas oven should never be lighted unless the door is wide open, because if, by any chance, gas has been escaping into the oven an explosion may occur.\n\nWhat We Mean by Good Air.\u2014Good air means air free from poisons or appreciable dust or objectionable odors. Above all, it means air that is not too warm or too cool and, if possible, in moderate and pleasant motion.\n\nHeating and Ventilation.\u2014Since cool, clean, fresh air is necessary for health, it is very important that the rooms in which we live and work should be well ventilated. Ventilation means a change of the air, or a supply of cool fresh air to take the place of that which has become stale and heated. About thirty cubic feet of fresh air per minute must be brought into a room for each person, in order that the bodily heat may be carried off and the air kept fresh and free from smell.\n\nIn warm weather and in a crowded room, where the heat from many bodies is considerable, overheating is the chief problem, and the air that enters should be cooler than the air in the room, so as to take up the excess heat. In cold weather, if a building has a system of direct heating by stoves or radiators in the room itself, the heating effect should be sufficient to balance the cool air admitted for ventilation. Some buildings are kept warm in winter by indirect heating, with warm air from a furnace or from a mechanical ventilating plant. In this case, the warm air sent into the rooms through the registers serves for both heating and ventilation, and should be at just the temperature, and in just the ?mount, to balance heat loss through the walls and yet keep the air of the room below 70\u00b0.\n\nMethods of Ventilation.\u2014The simplest way to get fresh air is to open the windows. Cold air is heavier than warm air and tends to fall, while warm air tends to rise. If a window is open at top and bottom and if it is cool outside, the warm air of the room will pass out at the top of the window, while the cool air from outside will enter at the bottom. If the wind is blowing, it may be a great aid in ventilation.\n\nThe trouble with window ventilation in winter is that the outside air is so much colder than the air indoors that it makes a draft near the windows, and persons sitting near them become too cool. Such drafts may be partially avoided by the use of sloping boards or glass plates made to fit into the bottom of the window, which direct the cool air upwards where it mixes with the air of the room. In very cold weather, a vertical board may be placed under the lower sash so that air comes in only between the sashes.\n\nIn some of the best schools, the ventilating and heating arrangements include sloping window plates, like those shown in Fig. 56, to direct the air upward; large radiators along the wall under the windows to warm the air some-what as it comes in; and ducts leading from near the ceiling out through the roof, to carry off the warm air which rises to the top of the room.\n\nIn small schools heated by stoves in the classrooms, the air often gets very stale if the windows are closed, while there are drafts if the windows are open. A sup-ply of fresh, but not too cold, air can be obtained, in such cases, by having a jacket around the stove with pipes leading in from the outer air to the lower part of the jacket. The heat of the stove will make an up-current and draw in fresh air through these pipes.\n\nIn larger school buildings, we usually find a system of indirect heating, fresh but warmed air being supplied by a mechanical ventilating system. This consists of a set of large ducts to bring warmed fresh air to each room and another set of ducts to take stale air out of each room, the air being driven through the ducts by revolving fans. Often this system is combined with radiators in the room, the system of heating then being called direct-indirect.\n\nWhatever the ventilating system may be, it is a good plan to open all the windows now and then and take a little vigorous gymnastic exercise. The change to a low temperature for a few minutes makes you feel brisk and wide-awake, and the exercise makes the heart beat faster and the lungs take in more air. By exercising, you make sure that the body does not become chilled by the change in temperature.\n\nOutdoor Life.\u2014There is nothing quite so good as life out of doors. If you are to grow up to be as healthy as possible, you should be out of doors all you can. The wind breaks up the layer of warm air that clings close to the body, and the constant slight changes in temperature keep the skin in good condition, by stimulating its blood vessels and nerves so that they can quickly adjust themselves to changing conditions.\n\nFresh Air in the Bedroom.\u2014It is especially important to have plenty of air in the sleeping room. Windows should be open at night, even in cold weather. Many people find that they grow stronger by sleeping on a porch in the open air. One should always take care, however, that there are enough covers on the bed to keep the body perfectly warm. It is dangerous to become chilled in sleeping.\n\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION AND REVIEW\n\n1. What is good air? Is the air better in the city or in the country? On a hilltop or in a hollow?\n\n2.

{"text":"There are severe health effects caused by burning coal.[2][3] According to the reports issued by the World Health Organization in 2008 and by environmental groups in 2004, coal particulates pollution are estimated to shorten approximately 1,000,000 lives annually worldwide, including nearly 24,000 lives a year in the United States.[4][5] Coal mining generates significant additional independent adverse environmental health impacts, among them the polluted water flowing from mountaintop removal mining.\n\nA major EU funded research study known as ExternE, or Externalities of Energy, undertaken over the period of 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal would double over its present value, if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health, from the airborne particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, chromium VI and arsenic emissions produced by coal, were taken into account. It was estimated in the study that external, downstream, fossil fuel costs amount up to 1\u20132% of the EU's entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with coal the main fossil fuel accountable for this, and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included.[6] The study also found that the environmental and health costs of coal alone were \u20ac0.06\/kWh, or 6 cents\/kWh, with the energy sources of the lowest external costs associated with them being nuclear power \u20ac0.0019\/kWh, and wind power at \u20ac0.0009\/kWh.[7]\n\nOpen-pit mining requires large amounts of water for coal preparation plants and dust suppression. To meet this requirement mines acquire (and remove) surface or groundwater supplies from nearby agricultural or domestic users, which reduces the productivity of these operations or halts them. These water resources (once separated from their original environment) are rarely returned after mining, creating a permanent degradation in agricultural productivity. Underground mining has a similar (but lesser) effect, due to a lower need for dust-suppression water; however, it still requires sufficient water for coal-washing.[citation needed]\n\nGroundwater supplies may be adversely affected by surface mining. These impacts include drainage of usable water from shallow aquifers; lowering of water levels in adjacent areas and changes in flow direction within aquifers; contamination of usable aquifers below mining operations due to infiltration (percolation) of poor-quality mine water; and increased infiltration of precipitation on spoil piles. Where coal (or carbonaceous shale) is present, increased infiltration may result in:\n\nThis may contaminate both groundwater and nearby streams for long periods. Deterioration of stream quality results from acid mine drainage, toxic trace elements, high content of dissolved solids in mine drainage water, and increased sediment loads discharged to streams.\n\nWhen coal surfaces are exposed, pyrite comes in contact with water and air and forms sulfuric acid. As water drains from the mine, the acid moves into the waterways; as long as rain falls on the mine tailings the sulfuric-acid production continues, whether the mine is still operating or not.[8] This process is known as acid rock drainage or acid mine drainage. If the coal is strip mined, the entire exposed seam leaches sulfuric acid; this leaves the subsoil infertile on the surface and begins to pollute streams.[citation needed]\n\nAlso waste piles and coal storage piles can yield sediment to streams. Leached water from these piles can be acid and contain toxic trace elements. Surface waters may be rendered unfit for agriculture, human consumption, bathing, or other household uses.[9] Lakes formed in abandoned surface-mining operations are more likely to be acid if there is coal or carbonaceous shale present in spoil piles, especially if these materials are near the surface and contain pyrites.[citation needed] Sulfuric acid is formed when minerals containing sulphide are oxidised through air contact; this causes acid rain. Leftover chemical deposits from explosives are toxic and increase the salt content of mine water, contaminating it.[citation needed]\n\nBy the late 1930s, it was estimated that American coal mines produced about 2.3 million tons of sulfuric acid annually. In the Ohio River basin, 1,200 operating coal mines drained an estimated annual 1.4 million tonnes of sulfuric acid into the drainage basin during the 1960s; thousands of abandoned coal mines leached acid as well. In Pennsylvania alone, mine drainage had blighted 2,000 stream miles by 1967.[citation needed]\n\nTo mitigate these problems, water is monitored at coal mines. The five principal technologies used to control water flow at mine sites are:\n\nDiversion systems\n\nContainment ponds\n\nGroundwater pumping systems\n\nSubsurface drainage systems\n\nSubsurface barriers\n\nIn the case of acid mine drainage, contaminated water is generally pumped to a treatment facility which neutralizes its contaminants.[citation needed]\n\nStrip mining severely alters the landscape, which reduces the value of the natural environment in the surrounding land.[10] The land surface is dedicated to mining activities until it can be reshaped and reclaimed. If mining is allowed, resident human populations must be resettled off the mine site; economic activities, such as agriculture or hunting and gathering food and medicinal plants are interrupted. What becomes of the land surface after mining is determined by the manner in which the mining is conducted. Usually reclamation of disturbed lands to a land use condition is not equal to the original use. Existing land uses (such as livestock grazing, crop and timber production) are temporarily eliminated from the mining area. High-value, intensive-land-use areas like urban and transportation systems are not usually affected by mining operations. If mineral values are sufficient, these improvements may be removed to an adjacent area.[citation needed]\n\nStrip mining eliminates existing vegetation, destroys the genetic soil profile, displaces or destroys wildlife and habitat, alters current land uses, and to some extent permanently changes the general topography of the area mined.[11] Adverse impacts on geological features of human interest may occur in a coal strip mine. Geomorphic and geophysical features and outstanding scenic resources may be sacrificed by indiscriminate mining. Paleontological, cultural, and other historic values may be endangered due to the disruptive activities of blasting, ripping, and excavating coal. Stripping of overburden eliminates and destroys archeological and historic features, unless they are removed beforehand.[12][13]\n\nThe removal of vegetative cover and activities associated with the construction of haul roads, stockpiling of topsoil, displacement of overburden and hauling of soil and coal increase the quantity of dust around mining operations. Dust degrades air quality in the immediate area, has an adverse impact on vegetative life, and constitutes health and safety hazards for mine workers and nearby residents.[12][13]\n\nSurface mining disrupts virtually all aesthetic elements of the landscape. Alteration of landforms often imposes unfamiliar and discontinuous configurations. New linear patterns appear as material is extracted and waste piles are developed. Different colors and textures are exposed as vegetative cover is removed and overburden dumped to the side. Dust, vibration, and diesel exhaust odors are created (affecting sight, sound, and smell). Residents of local communities often find such impacts disturbing or unpleasant. In case of mountaintop removal, tops are removed from mountains or hills to expose thick coal seams underneath. The soil and rock removed is deposited in nearby valleys, hollows and depressions, resulting in blocked (and contaminated) waterways.[12][13]\n\nRemoval of soil and rock overburden covering the coal resource may cause burial and loss of topsoil, exposes parent material, and creates large infertile wastelands. Soil disturbance and associated compaction result in conditions conducive to erosion. Soil removal from the area to be surface-mined alters or destroys many natural soil characteristics, and reduces its biodiversity and productivity for agriculture. Soil structure may be disturbed by pulverization or aggregate breakdown.[12]\n\nMine collapses (or mine subsidences) have the potential to produce major effects above ground, which are especially devastating in developed areas. German underground coal-mining (especially in North Rhine-Westphalia) has damaged thousands of houses, and the coal-mining industries have set aside large sums in funding for future subsidence damages as part of their insurance and state-subsidy schemes.[citation needed] In a particularly spectacular case in the German Saar region (another historical coal-mining area), a suspected mine collapse in 2008 created an earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, causing some damage to houses. Previously, smaller earthquakes had become increasingly common and coal mining was temporarily suspended in the area.[14]\n\nIn response to negative land effects of coal mining and the abundance of abandoned mines in the US the federal government enacted the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, which requires reclamation plans for future coal mining sites. These plans must be approved by federal or state authorities before mining begins.[11] As of 2003, over 2 million acres (8,000 km2) of previously mined lands have been reclaimed in the United States.[citation needed]\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency classified the 44 sites as potential hazards to communities (which means the waste sites could cause death and significant property damage if an event such as a storm, a terrorist attack or a structural failure caused a spill). They estimate that about 300 dry landfills and wet storage ponds are used around the country to store ash from coal-fired power plants. The storage facilities hold the noncombustible ingredients of coal and the ash trapped by equipment designed to reduce air pollution.[15]\n\nCoal fired boilers \/ power plants when using coal or lignite rich in limestone produces ash containing calcium oxide (CaO). CaO readily dissolves in water to form slaked lime \/ Ca(OH)2 and carried by rain water to rivers \/ irrigation water from the ash dump areas. Lime softening process precipitates Ca and Mg ions \/ removes temporary hardness in the water and also converts sodium bicarbonates in river water into sodium carbonate.[16]Sodium carbonate (washing soda) further reacts with the remaining Ca and Mg in the water to remove \/ precipitate the total hardness. Also water soluble sodium salts present in the ash enhance the sodium content in water further. Thus river water is converted into soft water by eliminating Ca and Mg ions and enhancing Na ions by coal fired boilers. Soft water application in irrigation (surface or ground water) converts the fertile soils into alkaline sodic soils.[17] River water alkalinity and sodicity problem is acute when many coal fired boilers and power stations are installed in a river basin. River water sodicity problem aggravates in the downstream of intensively cultivated river basins located in China, India, Egypt, Pakistan, west Asia, Australia, western USA, etc. due to accumulation of salts in the remaining water after meeting various transpiration and evaporation losses.[18]\n\nSurface mining of coal causes direct and indirect damage to wildlife. The impact on wildlife stems primarily from disturbing, removing and redistributing the land surface. Some impacts are short-term, and confined to the mine site; others have far-reaching, long-term effects.\n\nThe most direct effect on wildlife is destruction or displacement of species in areas of excavation and spoil piling. Pit and spoil areas are not capable of providing food and cover for most species of wildlife. Mobile wildlife species like game animals, birds, and predators leave these areas. More sedentary animals like invertebrates, reptiles, burrowing rodents and small mammals may be destroyed.[citation needed] The community of microorganisms and nutrient-cycling processes are upset by movement, storage, and redistribution of soil.\n\nWithout rehabilitation, these areas must undergo a weathering period (which may take a few years to many decades) before vegetation is established and they become suitable habitat. With rehabilitation, impacts on some species are less severe. Humans cannot immediately restore natural biotic communities; they can, however, assist nature through reclamation of land and rehabilitation efforts geared to wildlife needs. Rehabilitation not geared to the needs of wildlife species (or improper management of other land uses after reclamation) can preclude reestablishment of the original fauna.[citation needed]\n\nMany wildlife species are highly dependent on vegetation growing in natural drainage areas. This vegetation provides essential food, nesting sites and cover from predators. Activity destroying this vegetation near ponds, reservoirs, marshes and wetlands reduces the quality and quantity of habitat essential for waterfowl, shorebirds and terrestrial species. The commonly used head-of-hollow fill method for disposing of excess overburden is of particular significance to wildlife habitat. Narrow, steep-sided, V-shaped hollows near ridge tops are frequently inhabited by rare or endangered animal and plant species. Extensive placement of spoil in these narrow valleys eliminates habitat for a wide variety of species, some of which may be driven to extinction.[citation needed]\n\nBroad and long-lasting impacts on wildlife are caused by habitat impairment. The habitat requirements of many animal species do not permit them to adjust to changes created by land disturbance. These changes reduce living space, and some species can tolerate very little disturbance. In instances where a particularly critical habitat is restricted (such as a lake, pond, or primary breeding area), a species could be eliminated. The range of damage possible is wide.[citation needed]\n\nLarge mammals and other animals displaced from their home ranges may be forced to use adjacent areas, already stocked to their carrying capacity. This overcrowding results in degradation of remaining habitat, lowered carrying capacity, reduced reproductive success, increased inter- and intra-species competition, and potentially greater losses to wildlife populations than the number of originally displaced animals.[citation needed]\n\nDegradation of aquatic habitats is a major impact by surface mining, and may be apparent many miles from a mining site. Sediment contamination of surface water is common with surface mining. Sediment yields may increase a thousand times times their former level as a result of strip mining.[19] If streams, lakes, ponds or marshes are filled or drained, fish, aquatic invertebrates and amphibians are destroyed. Food supplies for predators are reduced by destruction of these land and water species. Animal populations displaced or destroyed can eventually be replaced from populations in surrounding ranges, provided the habitat is eventually restored; an exception would be the extinction of a resident endangered species.[citation needed]\n\nPreferred food and cover plants can be established in these openings to benefit a variety of wildlife. Under certain conditions, creation of small lakes in the mined area may also be beneficial. These lakes and ponds may become important water sources for a variety of wildlife inhabiting adjacent areas. Many lakes formed in mine pits are of poor quality as aquatic habitat after mining due to lack of structure, aquatic vegetation, and food species. They may require habitat enhancement and management to be of significant wildlife value.[citation needed]\n\nThe effects of sediment on aquatic wildlife vary with the species and the amount of contamination. High sediment levels can kill fish directly, bury spawning beds, reduce light transmission, alter temperature gradients, fill in pools, spread streamflows over wider, shallower areas, and reduce production of aquatic organisms used as food by other species. These changes destroy the habitat of valued species, and may enhance habitat for less-desirable species. Existing conditions are already marginal for some freshwater fish in the United States, and the sedimentation of their habitat may result in their extinction. The heaviest sediment pollution of a drainage normally comes within 5 to 25 years after mining. In some areas, unvegetated spoil piles continue to erode even 50 to 65 years after mining.[11]\n\nThe presence of acid-forming materials exposed as a result of surface mining can affect wildlife by eliminating habitat and by causing direct destruction of some species. Lesser concentrations can suppress productivity, growth rate and reproduction of many aquatic species. Acids, dilute concentrations of heavy metals, and high alkalinity can cause severe damage to wildlife in some areas. The duration of acidic-waste pollution can be long; estimates of the time required to leach exposed acidic materials in the Eastern United States range from 800 to 3,000 years.[11]\n\nDuring combustion, the reaction between coal and the air produces oxides of carbon, including carbon dioxide (CO2 (an important greenhouse gas)), oxides of sulfur (mainly sulfur dioxide) (SO2), and various oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Because of the hydrogenous and nitrogenous components of coal, hydrides and nitrides of carbon and sulfur are also produced during the combustion of coal in air. These include hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sulfur nitrate (SNO3) and other toxic substances.\n\nFurther, acid rain may occur when sulfur dioxide produced by the combustion of coal reacts with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide (SO3); this reacts with water molecules in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid (H2SO4) returns to earth as acid rain. Flue-gas desulfurization scrubbing systems, which use lime to remove sulfur dioxide, can reduce the likelihood of acid rain.[citation needed]\n\nHowever, another form of acid rain is due to carbon dioxide emissions of a coal plant. When released into the atmosphere, the carbon dioxide molecules react with water molecules, to slowly produce carbonic acid (H2CO3). This, in turn, returns to the earth as a corrosive substance. This cannot be prevented as easily as sulfur-dioxide emissions.[citation needed]\n\nThe wet cooling towers used in coal fired power stations, etc. emit drift and fog which are also environmental concern. The drift from the cooling towers is containing Respirable suspended particulate matter. In case of cooling towers with sea water makeup, sodium salts are deposited on nearby lands which would convert the land into alkali soil by reducing the fertility of vegetative lands and also cause corrosion of nearby structures.\n\nFires sometimes occur in coal beds underground. When coal beds are exposed, the fire risk is increased. Weathered coal can also increase ground temperatures if it is left on the surface. Almost all fires in solid coal are ignited by surface fires caused by people or lightning. Spontaneous combustion is caused when coal oxidizes and airflow is insufficient to dissipate heat; this more commonly occurs in stockpiles and waste piles, rarely in bedded coal underground. Where coal fires occur, there is attendant air pollution from emission of smoke and noxious fumes into the atmosphere. Coal seam fires may burn underground for decades, threatening destruction of forests, homes, roadways and other valuable infrastructure. The best-known coal-seam fire may be the one which led to the permanent evacuation of Centralia, Pennsylvania, United States.[21]\n\nMercury emission from coal burning are concentrated as they work their way up the food chain and are converted into methylmercury, a toxic compound which harms both wildlife and people who consume freshwater fish.[22][23][24][24][25] Coal burning is a key source of methylmercury in the environment.[26] \"Power plants... are responsible for half of... the mercury emissions in the United States.\"[27]\n\nIn New York State winds bring mercury from the coal-fired power plants of the Midwest, contaminating the waters of the Catskill Mountains. The mercury is consumed by worms, which are eaten by fish, which are eaten by birds (including bald eagles). As of 2008, mercury levels in bald eagles in the Catskills had reached new heights.[28] \"People are exposed to methylmercury almost entirely by eating contaminated fish and wildlife that are at the top of aquatic food chains.\"[29] Ocean fish account for the majority of human exposure to methylmercury; the full range of sources of methylmercury in ocean fish is not well understood.[30]\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency has proposed the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) regulations,[31] which require all coal plants use the technology which is available to substantially reduce mercury emissions.[32] \"Today, more than half of all coal-fired power plants already deploy pollution control technologies that will help them meet these achievable standards. Once final, these standards will level the playing field by ensuring the remaining plants \u2013 about 40 percent of all coal fired power plants - take similar steps to decrease dangerous pollutants.\"[27] This technology is expected to save many thousands of lives every year, and to protect Americans from severe permanent health effects such as those suffered by children exposed to mercury in the womb.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations calculated that coal particulates pollution cause approximately one million deaths annually across the world,[5][not in citation given] which is approximately one third of all premature deaths related to all air pollution sources.[33]\n\nPollutants emitted by burning coal include fine particulates (PM2.5) and ground level ozone. Every year, the burning of coal without the use of available pollution control technology causes thousands of preventable deaths in the United States. A study commissioned by the Maryland nurses association in 2006 found that emissions from just six of Maryland's coal-burning plants caused 700 deaths per year nationwide, including 100 in Maryland.[34] Since installation of pollution abatement equipment on one of these six, the Brandon Shores plant, now \"produces 90 percent less nitrogen oxide, an ingredient of smog; 95 percent less sulfur, which causes acid rain; and vastly lower fractions of other pollutants.\"[34]\n\nAccording to a report published in 2004, coal-fired power plants shorten nearly 24,000 lives a year in the United States (2,800 from lung cancer).[4] In the United States alone, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that a range of 13,000 to 34,000 preventable premature deaths will be avoided by the reductions in PM2.5 and ozone expected by the end of the several-years time needed to complete implementation of the coal plant cleanup provisions of the Final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR).[35] The EPA promulgated these legally enforceable requirements to install available lifesaving pollution control equipment in 2011 under a court order mandating that it protect Americans' health, a duty mandated by Congress in the Clean Air Act.[citation needed]\n\nIn addition to preventing avoidable premature deaths, the Final Cross-State rule is estimated to prevent 15,000 additional (non-fatal) heart attacks, 19,000 attacks of acute bronchitis; 420,000 upper and lower respiratory symptoms, 400,000 aggravated asthma attacks; and 19,000 hospital and ER trips (e.g., for asthma attacks triggered by soot from coal burning). By reducing the health detriments that arise from burning coal without using available pollution controls, implementation of the Final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule is expected to reduce days when people must miss work or school by 1.8 million.[36][37]\n\nThe Cross-State Air Pollution Rule requires significant reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions that cross state lines. These pollutants react in the atmosphere to form fine particles and ground-level ozone and are transported long distances, making it difficult for other states to achieve healthy levels of pollution control.[citation needed]\n\nThe benefits of the emission reductions expected from EPA's recently proposed Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) are not included in the above estimated emission reductions from the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule; once the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards[32] are implemented, death and disease from coal burning are likely to be reduced even further, both directly by reducing mercury poisoning, and by reducing sulfur dioxide emissions.[citation needed]\n\nCoal mining produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane is the naturally occurring product of the decay of organic matter as coal deposits are formed with increasing depths of burial, rising temperatures, and rising pressure over geological time. A portion of the methane produced is absorbed by the coal and later released from the coal seam (and surrounding disturbed strata) during the mining process.[40] Methane accounts for 10.5 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions created through human activity.[41] According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane has a global warming potential 21 times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year timeline. The process of mining can release pockets of methane. These gases may pose a threat to coal miners, as well as a source of air pollution. This is due to the relaxation of pressure and fracturing of the strata during mining activity, which gives rise to safety concerns for the coal miners if not managed properly. The buildup of pressure in the strata can lead to explosions during (or after) the mining process if prevention methods, such as \"methane draining\", are not taken.[40]\n\nIn 2008 James E. Hansen and Pushker Kharecha published a peer-reviewed scientific study analyzing the effect of a coal phase-out on atmospheric CO2 levels.Their baseline mitigation scenario was a phaseout of global coal emissions by 2050. Under the Business as Usual scenario, atmospheric CO2 peaks at 563 parts per million (ppm) in the year 2100. Under the four coal phase-out scenarios, atmospheric CO2 peaks at 422\u2013446 ppm between 2045 and 2060 and declines thereafter.[42]\n\nCoal also contains low levels of uranium, thorium, and other naturally occurring radioactive isotopes whose release into the environment may lead to radioactive contamination.[20][43] Coal plants emit radiation in the form of radioactive fly ash which is inhaled and ingested by neighbours, and incorporated into crops. A 1978 paper from Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimated that coal-fired power plants of that time may contribute a whole-body committed dose of 19 \u00b5Sv\/yr to their immediate neighbours in a 500 m radius.[44] The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation's 1988 report estimated the committed dose 1 km away to be 20 \u00b5Sv\/yr for older plants or 1\u00b5Sv\/yr for newer plants with improved fly ash capture, but was unable to confirm these numbers by test.[45] A single PWR spent fuel bundle, after 10 years cooldown, with no shielding, emits 2.3 MSv\/yr, a trillion times more than coal.[46] However, if we exclude contained waste and ignore unintentional releases from nuclear plants, coal-plants carry more radioactive wastes into the environment than nuclear plants producing the same amount of energy. Plant-emitted radiation carried by coal-derived fly ash delivers 100 times more radiation to the surrounding environment than does the normal operation of a similarly productive nuclear plant.[47] This comparison does not consider the rest of the fuel cycle, i.e., coal and uranium mining and refining and waste disposal."}
{"text":"Air Scrubbers\n\nAir scrubbers, also known as negative air machines, aggressively clean the air of hazardous particulates, chemicals, and gases left behind by water, mold, chemical, or fire damage. These heavy-duty air cleaners work by pulling in contaminated air, passing it through multiple air filters that are often HEPA-grade, and exhausting clean air back out into a space or into a separate area through ductwork. When ducted, a HEPA air scrubber creates negative air pressure, which helps to limit the spread of contaminants to surrounding areas. By design, air scrubbers have extremely large CFM (cubic feet per minute) capacities. Some models can clean as much as 2,000 cubic feet of air per minute."}
{"text":"The Surprising Truth About What You're Breathing\n\nThe dirtiest air in America isn't the smoggy haze blanketing Los Angeles. In a new report from the American Lung Association, the City of Angels was edged out by Bakersfield, California, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for that dubious distinction. Don't live there? Doesn't mean your air is A+ pure, because the scary fact is that the worst air of all just might be in your own home, car, or backyard.\n\nThe culprit you need to watch out for is particle pollution. Major sources include smokestack emissions, vehicle exhaust, and coal-fired power plants -- but smoking, household appliances, woodstoves, even candles and incense can spew them, too. These particles don't sound dangerous until you know that ultrafine ones (2 to 10 microns) -- some so small that 50,000 could fit on the period at the end of this sentence -- can lodge in your lungs and even sneak into your bloodstream. There, they can trigger asthma attacks, worsen (or even cause) serious respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and increase your risk of heart attacks, strokes, and early death. They cause generalized inflammation in your body once they get into your lungs. True, the air throughout the United States is cleaner than it was 10 years ago, but 6 in 10 Americans still live in places where outdoor particle pollution (\"particulate\" matter in scientist-speak) reaches unhealthful levels, and at least 30% of Canadians live where particulate levels are too high. And what we do in our homes and cars can make things far worse -- or far better.\n\nAvoiding particulates could save your lungs, your health, and your life. In California alone, particulates still kill an estimated 18,000 people a year, one reason environmental health advocates consider particulates one the most widespread and dangerous air-quality issues in America. (The other is ozone, produced when two chemical pollutants react in stagnant air on sunny days.) In one German study, exposure to particulates and other air pollutants from car fumes tripled heart attack risk for men and raised it fivefold for women.\n\nParticulates are bad news for everybody; that means kids, older folks, and even healthy adults. Here's how to keep these sneaky particles under control:\n\nHave a Plan B for dirty-air days. Sunny, hot summer days can create the perfect conditions for ground-level ozone, a lung-damaging compound that forms when various air pollutants react in the presence of sunlight. Ozone and particulates are often high on the same days, and together they can be even more damaging to your respiratory system than either one alone. Pay attention to the day-to-day air quality where you live; often, it's part of the weather report. If not, look up ozone and particulate levels at airnow.gov, which has a minute-to-minute report by zip code. When the air is unhealthy, children and people with respiratory diseases should limit time outside; when it's extremely unhealthy, even adults without health problems should do that, too.\n\nLive in a bad-air town? Create a safe haven. If you have respiratory or cardiovascular problems, such as diagnosed heart disease, or simply like the idea of breathing cleaner air when the outdoor stuff's dirty (we do!), consider installing a HEPA air filter or an air conditioner that contains one in at least one room. This won't eliminate all pollutants and particulates, but it can help.\n\nWalk, run, and bike away from busy roadways. Exercise makes you breathe faster and deeper, drawing more air -- and more particulates -- deep into your lungs. Instead of dodging traffic, choose less-traveled (but still safe) places for outdoor workouts.\n\nStop being the #1 air polluter in your home. Most of us spend 90% of our time indoors. Cigarette smoke is the single largest source of particulates in homes, so don't let people smoke in your home (better yet, encourage them to quit). Keep furnaces in good repair, and be sure that vents to heaters, clothes dryers, and ranges are clean and working properly. Turn on the exhaust fan while cooking, because frying and sauteing fling particulates into the air. Think twice about incense and candles, which also may produce particulates when burned.\n\nLeave your chariot at home. Despite vents, filters, and air conditioners, the air inside cars was 2 to 10 times dirtier than the air outside in one study conducted on the freeways of Los Angeles. If you can't walk (somewhere that's not near the highway), at least don't tailgate. Half the pollutants inside a car come from the vehicle directly ahead of you. Exhaust spewing from older, heavy-duty diesel engines increased particulate levels inside cars up to ninefold. Opt for the carpool lanes to keep overall pollution 30% to 50% lower, drive at off hours, and avoid congested areas.\n\nBe part of the solution. Reducing your personal \"emissions footprint\" is just the first step. Another way to make a difference is to urge people in government agencies to set tougher pollution standards. That's what has worked in the past 10 years. One easy way to keep progress alive: Send a message through the American Lung Association's campaign for cleaner air at"}
