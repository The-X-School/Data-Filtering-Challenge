{"text":"A honeypot is an information system resource whose value lies in unauthorized or illicit use of that resource. They are closely monitored network decoys serving several purposes: they can distract adversaries from more valuable machines on a network, they can provide early warning about new attack and exploitation trends and they allow in-depth examination of adversaries during and after exploitation of a honeypot.\n\n\u2022Has no production value; anything going to\/from a honeypot is likely a probe, attack or compromise\n\n\u2022Used for monitoring, detecting and analyzing attacks\n\n\u2022Does not solve a specific problem. Instead, they are a highly flexible tool with different applications to security\n\n\u2022A trap set to detect and deflect attempts at unauthorized use of information systems.\n\n\u2022It consist of a computer, data or a network site that appears to be part of a network but which is actually isolated & protected.\n\n\u2022Whatever they capture is supposed to be malicious & unauthorized.\n\nAn example of a honeypot is a system used to simulate one or more network services that you designate on your computer's ports. An attacker assumes you're running vulnerable services that can be used to break into the machine. This kind of honeypot can be used to log access attempts to those ports including the attacker's keystrokes. This could give you advanced warning of a more concerted attack\n\nEtymology\n\nThe term \"honeypot\" is often understood to refer to the English children's character Winnie-the-Pooh, a stuffed bear who was lured into various predicaments by his desire for pots of honey.\n\nDuring the Cold War it was an espionage technique, which inspired spy fiction. The term \"honeypot\" was used to describe the use of female to gain secret information. In a common scenario, a pretty female Communist agent would trick a male Western official into handing over secret information.\n\nAn alternative explanation for the term is a reflection of the sarcastic term for outhouses and other methods of collecting feces and other human waste in places that lack indoorplumbing. Honey is a euphemism for such waste, which is kept in a honeypot until it is picked up by a honey wagon and taken to a disposal area. In this usage, attackers are the equivalent of flies, drawn by the stench of sewage\n\nHistory of Honeypot\n\nThe concept of the honeypot is not new. In fact as early as 1991, a number of publications expounded on concepts that were to be foundations of today's honeypot development. Two publications in particular stood out:\n\nv1990\/1991The Cuckoo's Egg and Evening with Berferd\n\nClifford Stoll was an astrophysicist turned systems manager at Lawrence Berkeley Lab. Due to a 75 percent accounting error was able to track down a hacker that was using their computers as a launching pad to hack hundreds of military, industrial, and academic computers in search of secrets. His book \"The Cuckoo's Egg\", published in 1988, detailed his experiences through this 3 year incident where he observed the hacker and subsequently gathered information that led to the hackers arrest.\n\nThe other publication that was of particular note during this period was \"An Evening with Berferd\" by the well respected Internet Security expert, Bill Cheswick. In the paper, Mr. Cheswick describes how he and his colleagues set up their jail machine, also known as roach motel2 in which they chronicled a hackers movements and the bait and traps they used to lure and detect him.\n\nv1997 - Deception Toolkit\n\nThe Deception Toolkit is one of the original and landmark Honeypots. It is generally a collection of PERL scripts designed for UNIX systems that emulate a variety of known vulnerabilities. The concept put forward by the DTK is \"deceptive defense\" which now central in Honeypot concepts and implementations\n\nv1998 - CyberCop Sting\n\nCyberCop Sting is a component of the CyberCop intrusion protection software family which runs on NT. Cybercop Sting has also been referred to as a \"decoy server\" for it can simulate a network containing several different types of network devices, including Windows NT servers, Unix servers and routers. Each of these decoys had the ability to track, record, and report intrusive activity to network and security administrators. As with the DTK, each of these decoys can run simulated services. However, as with the problem with most simulated or low-interaction Honeypots, you can only only simulate limited functionality with Cybercop sting such as telnet logins or SMTP banners thus limiting its ability to deceive and to study hackers in the long term.\n\nv1998 - NetFacade (and Snort)\n\nAs with Cybercop Sting, it creates a simulated network of hosts, with simulated IP addresses, running seemingly vulnerable services but in a much larger scale. NetFacade can simulate an entire class C network up to 254 systems. It can also simulate 7 different operating systems with a variety of different services.\n\nv1998 - BackOfficer Friendly\n\nBack Officer Friendly runs in Windows and was free thus giving more people access to Honeypot technology. Though It didn't give much functionality it was still a very useful piece of software which demonstrated the concepts of the Honeypot to a lot of people that who were not familiar to Honeypot concepts at that time.\n\nv1999 - Formation of the Honeynet Project 9\n\nA group of people led by Lance Spitzner decided to form the Honeynet Project 9. The honeynet project is a non-profit group dedicated to researching the blackhat community and to share their work to others. Their primary tool for research is the honeynet, an advanced form of Honeypot.\n\nv2003- Some Honeypot Tools\n\nIn 2003, several important Honeypot tools were introduced through these organizations such as Snort-Inline12, Sebek13, and advanced virtual honeynets14.\n\n\u00d8Sebek provided a means to capture hacker activities in Honeypots by logging their keystrokes.\n\n\u00d8Virtual honeynets provided a means to deploy multiple honeynets with just one computer.\n\nClassification of Honetpot\n\n\u2022By level of interaction\n\n\u00d8High\n\n\u00d8Low\n\n\u2022By Implementation\n\n\u00d8Virtual\n\n\u00d8Physical\n\n\u2022By purpose\n\n\u00d8Production\n\n\u00d8Research\n\n1). Level of Interaction\n\nInteraction defines the level of activity a honeypot allows an attacker. There are two categories of interaction \"Low Level \" & \"High Level Interaction\" which helps us understand what type of honeypot you are dealing with, its strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nLow Interaction:Low-interaction honeypots have limited interaction, they normally work by emulating services and operating systems. Attacker activity is limited to the level of emulation by the honeypot.\n\n\u00d8Simulates some aspects of the system\n\n\u00d8Easy to deploy, minimal risk\n\n\u00d8Limited Information\n\nAdvantages\n\n\u00d8Its simplicity.\n\n\u00d8These honeypots tend to be easier to deploy and maintain, with minimal risk.\n\n\u00d8Usually they involve installing software, selecting the operating systems and services you want to emulate and monitor, and letting the honeypot go from there. This plug and play approach makes deploying them very easy for most organizations.\n\n\u00d8The emulated services mitigate risk by containing the attacker's activity, the attacker never has access to an operating system to attack or harm others.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\u00d8They log only limited information and are designed to capture known activity.\n\n\u00d8It's easier for an attacker to detect a low-interaction honeypot, no matter how good the emulation is, skilled attacker can eventually detect their presence.\n\nExamples of low-interaction honeypots include Specter, Honeyd, and KFSensor.\n\nHigh Interaction:High-interaction honeypots are different; they are usually complex solutions as they involve real operating systems and applications. Nothing is emulated; we give attackers the real thing. If you want a Linux honeypot running an FTP server, you build a real Linux system running a real FTP server.\n\n\u00d8Simulates all aspects of the OS: real systems\n\n\u00d8Can be compromised completely, higher risk\n\n\u00d8More Information\n\n\u00d8Honey-net\n\nAdvantages\n\n\u00d8Extensive amounts of information can be captured. By giving attackers real systems to interact with, you can learn the full extent of their behavior, everything from new rootkits to international IRC sessions.\n\n\u00d8They make no assumptions on how an attacker will behave. Instead, they provide an open environment that captures all activity. This allows high-interaction solutions to learn behavior we would not expect.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\u00d8It increases the risk of the honeypot as attackers can use these real operating system to attack non-honeypot systems.\n\nAs result, additional technologies have to be implement that prevent the attacker from harming other non-honeypot systems\n\nDifference between high level interaction and low level interaction\n\nLow-interaction\n\nSolution emulates operating systems and services.\n\n\u00d8 Easy to install and deploy. Usually requires simply installing and configuring software on a computer.\n\n\u00d8 Minimal risk, as the emulated services control what attackers can and cannot do.\n\n\u00d8Can capture far more information, including new tools, communications, or attacker keystrokes.\n\n\u00d8Can be complex to install or deploy (commercial versions tend to be much simpler).\n\n\u00d8Increased risk, as attackers are provided real operating systems to interact with\n\n2). Physical vs Virtual Honeypots\n\n\u00d8A \"Physical Honeypot\" is a real machine on the network with its own IP address.\n\n\u2022Real machines\n\n\u2022Own IP Addresses\n\n\u2022Often high-interactive\n\n\u00d8A \"Virtual Honeypot\" is simulated by another machine that responds to network traffic sent to the virtual honeypot\n\n\u2022Simulated by other machines that:\n\n\u2013 Respond to the traffic sent to the honeypots\n\n\u2013 May simulate a lot of (different) virtual honeypots at the same time.\n\nA software program that is designed to appear to be a real functioning network but is actually a decoy built specifically to be probed and attacked by malicious users. In contrast to a honeypot, which is typically a hardware device that lures users into its trap, a virtual honeypot uses software to emulate a network.\n\nPhysical honeypots are often high-interaction, so allowing the system to be compromised completely, they are expensive to install and maintain. For large address spaces, it is impractical or impossible to deploy a physical honeypot for each IP address. In that case, we need to deploy virtual honeypots.\n\n3). Production vs Research honeypot\n\nProduction honeypots are systems that help mitigate risk in your organization or environment. They provide specific value to securing your systems and networks. Their job is to take care of the bad guys. How do they accomplish this? To answer that question, we are going to break down security into three categories and then review how honeypots can or cannot add value to each one of them. The three categories are as:\n\nPrevention:\n\nIn terms of security, prevention means keeping the bad guys out. If you were to secure your house, prevention would be similar to placing deadbolt locks on your doors, locking your windows, and perhaps installing a chainlink fence around your yard. You are doing everything possible to keep out the threat. The security community uses a variety of tools to prevent unauthorized activity. Examples include firewalls that control what traffic can enter or leave a network or authentication, such as strong passwords, digital certificates, or two-factor authentication that requires individuals or resources to properly identify themselves. Based on this authentication, one can determine who is authorized to access resources. Mechanisms such as encryption prevent attackers from reading or accessing critical information, such as passwords or confidential documents.\n\nWhat role do honeypots play here? How do honeypots keep out the bad guys?\n\nHoneypots adds little value to prevention, since they do not deter the enemy. In fact, if incorrectly implemented, a honeypot may introduce risk, providing an attacker a window into an organization. The deception concept is used to have attackers' waste time and resources in attacking honeypots, as opposed to attacking production systems. The deterrence concept is that if attackers know there are honeypots in an organization, they may be scared off as they do not want to be detected or they do not want to waste their time or resources attacking the honeypots.\n\nBoth concepts are psychological weapons used to confuse a human attacker but most attacks are usually performed by automated tools, such as auto-rooters or worms so deception or deterrence will not be able to prevent these attacks because there is no conscious individual to deter or deceive.\n\nBoth concepts fail to prevent the most common of attacks: targets of opportunity. The attacker use automated tools that hack into systems for them. These attackers do not spend time analyzing the systems they target. They merely take a shotgun approach, hitting as many computers as possible and seeing what they get into.\n\nHowever, the time and resources involved in deploying honeypots for preventing attacks, especially prevention based on deception or deterrence is time better spent on security best practices. As long as you have vulnerable systems, you will be hacked. No honeypot can prevent that.\n\nDetection:\n\nThe second tier of security is detection, the act of detecting and alerting unauthorized activity. If you were to secure your house, detection would be the installation of burglar alarms and motion detectors. These alarms go off when someone breaks in. In case the window was left open or the lock on the front door was picked, we want to detect the burglar if they get into our house. Within the world of information security, we have the same challenge. Sooner or later, prevention will fail, and the attacker will get in. There are a variety of reasons why this failure can happen: A firewall rule base may be misconfigured, an employee uses an easy-to-guess password, and a new vulnerability is discovered in an application. There are numerous methods for penetrating an organization. Prevention can only mitigate risk; it will never eliminate it.\n\nWithin the security community, Network Intrusion Detection Systems, are designed to monitor networks and detect any malicious activity. However, they do not keep out the bad guys, but they alert us if someone is trying to get in and if they are successful.\n\nHow do honeypots help detect unauthorized or suspicious activity? While honeypots add limited value to prevention, they add extensive value to detection. For many organizations, detection is extremely difficult. Three common challenges of detection are :\n\nvFalse positives are when systems falsely alert suspicious or malicious activity. What a system thought was an attack or exploit attempt was actually valid production traffic.\n\nvFalse negatives are the exact opposite: They are when an organization fails to detect an attack.\n\nvThe third challenge is Data aggregation, centrally collecting all the data used for detection and then corroborating that data into valuable information.\n\nA single false positive is not a problem. The problem occurs when these false alerts happen hundreds or even thousands of times a day. System administrators may receive so many alerts in one day that they cannot respond to all of them and hence start ignoring these false positive alerts as they come in day after day. Network Intrusion Detection Systems are very familar with false positives. The only solution to false positives is to modify the system to not alert about valid, production traffic. This is an extremely time-consuming process, requiring highly skilled individuals who understand network traffic, system logs, and application activity.\n\nA false negative is when a system fails to detect a valid attack. The risk is that a successful attack may occur, but the systems fail to detect and alert to the activity. NIDS not only face the challenge of false positives but also have problems with false negatives.\n\nThe third challenge to detection is data aggregation. Modern technology is extremely effective at capturing extensive amounts of data. NIDS, system logs, application logs\u2014all of these resources are very good at capturing and generating gigabytes of data. The challenge becomes how to aggregate all this data so it has value in detecting and confirming an attack.\n\nDue to their simplicity, honeypots effectively address the three challenges of detection: false positives, false negatives, and data aggregation. Most honeypots have no production traffic, so there is little activity to generate false positives.\n\nHoneypots address false negatives because they are not easily defeated by new exploits. In fact, one of their primary benefits is they can detect a new attack by virtue of system activity, not signatures. It works on the concept that anything sent its way is suspect.\n\nThe simplicity of honeypots also addresses the third issue: data aggregation. Honeypots address this issue by creating very little data. There is no valid production traffic to be logged, collected, or aggregated. Honeypots generate only several megabytes of data a day, most of which is of high value. This makes it extremely easy to diagnose useful information from honeypots.\n\nResponse\n\nOnce we detect a successful attack, we need the ability to respond. When securing our house, we want to be sure someone can protect us in case of a break-in. Often house burglar alarms are wired to monitoring stations or the local police department. When an alarm goes off, the proper authorities are alerted and can quickly react, protecting your house. The same logic applies to securing your organization. Honeypots add value to the response aspect of security.\n\nWhen an attacker breaks into a system, their actions leave evidence, evidence that can be used to determine how the attacker got in, what they did once they gained control of the system, and who were they. It is this evidence that is critical to capture. Without it, organizations cannot effectively respond to the incident.\n\nHoneypots can help address these challenges to reaction capability. Remember, a honeypot has no production activity, so this helps the problem of data pollution. When a honeypot is compromised, the only real activity on the system is the activity of the attacker, helping to maintain its integrity. If we look at our train station analogy, imagine a crime at a train station where there are no people or trains coming or going. Evidence such as fingerprints or hair samples are far more likely to remain intact. The same case is true for honeypots. Honeypots can also easily be taken offline for further analysis. Since honeypots provide no production services, organizations can easily take them down for analysis without impacting business activity.\n\nResearch Honeypots are complex to deploy and maintain, capture extensive information and are used primarily by research, military or government organization. They can be used for the following:\n\n\u00d8To capture automated threats, such as worms or auto-rooters. By quickly capturing these weapons and analyzing their malicious payload, organizations can better react to and neutralize the threat.\n\n\u00d8As an early warning mechanism, predicting when future attacks will happen. This works by deploying multiple honeypots in different locations and organizations. The data collected from these research honeypots can then be used for statistical modeling, predicting future attacks. Attacks can then be identified and stopped before they happen.\n\n\u00d8To capture unknown tools or techniques\n\n\u00d8To better understand attackers' motives and organization. By capturing their activity after they break into a system, such as communications among each other, we can better understand who our threat is and why they operate.\n\n\u00d8To gain information on advanced blackhats\n\nAdvantages of Honeypot\n\nHoneypots are a tremendously simply concept, which gives them some very powerful strengths.\n\n\u00d8Small data sets of high value: Honeypots collect small amounts of information. Instead of logging a one GB of data a day, they can log only one MB of data a day. Instead of generating 10,000 alerts a day, they can generate only 10 alerts a day. Remember, honeypots only capture bad activity; any interaction with a honeypot is most likely unauthorized or malicious activity. As such, honeypots reduce 'noise' by collectin only small data sets, but information of high value, as it is only the bad guys. This means its much easier (and cheaper) to analyze the data a honeypot collects and derive value from it.\n\n\u00d8New tools and tactics: Honeypots are designed to capture anything thrown at them, including tools or tactics never seen before.\n\n\u00d8Minimal resources: Honeypots require minimal resources, they only capture bad activity. This means an old Pentium computer with 128MB of RAM can easily handle an entire class B network sitting off an OC-12 network.\n\n\u00d8Encryption or IPv6: Unlike most security technologies (such as IDS systems) honeypots work fine in encrypted or IPv6 environments. It does not matter what the bad guys throw at a honeypot, the honeypot will detect and capture it.\n\n\u00d8Information: Honeypots can collect in-depth information that few, if any other technologies can match.\n\n\u00d8Simplicty: Finally, honeypots are conceptually very simple. There are no fancy algorithms to develop, state tables to maintain, or signatures to update. The simpler a technology, the less likely there will be mistakes or misconfigurations.\n\nDisadvantages of Honeypot\n\nLike any technology, honeypots also have their weaknesses. It is because of this they do not replace any current technology, but work with existing technologies.\n\n\u00d8Limited view: Honeypots can only track and capture activity that directly interacts with them. Honeypots will not capture attacks against other systems, unless the attacker or threat interacts with the honeypots also.\n\n\u00d8Risk: All security technologies have risk. Firewalls have risk of being penetrated, encryption has the risk of being broken, IDS sensors have the risk of failing to detect attacks. Honeypots are no different, they have risk also. Specifically, honeypots have the risk of being taken over by the bad guy and being used to harm other systems. These risk various for different honeypots. Depending on the type of honeypot, it can have no more risk then an IDS sensor, while some honeypots have a great deal of risk.\n\nby Niels Provos, A virtual honey pot application, which allows us to create thousands of IP addresses with virtual machines and corresponding network services. It is open source software released under GNU General Public License.\n\n\u2022It is able to simulate big network on a single host.\n\n\u2022It provides simple functionality.\n\n\u2022It gives an attacker to fa\u00e7ade to attack\n\nHoneyd\n\nHoneyd is a low-interaction honeypot. Developed\n\nHow Honeyd Works\n\nHoneyd works on the concept of monitoring unused IP space. Anytime it sees a connection attempt to an unused IP, it intercepts the connection and then interacts with the attacker, pretending to be the victim. By default, Honeyd detects and logs any connection to any UDP or TCP port. In addition, you can configure emulated services to monitor specific ports, such as an emulated FTP server monitoring TCP port 21. When an attacker connects to the emulated service, not only does the honeypot detect and log the activity, but it captures all of the attacker's interaction with the emulated service. In the case of the emulated FTP server, we can potentially capture the attacker's login and password, the commands they issue, and perhaps even learn what they are looking for or their identity. It all depends on the level of emulation by the honeypot. Most emulated\n\nservices work the same way.\n\nKnow Your Enemy:\nHoneynets\n\nHoneynet\n\nTradationally information security has been primarily defensive. Firewalls, Intrusion detection system, encryption; all of these mechanism are used defensively to protect one's resource. The strategy is to defend one's organization as best as possible, detect any failures in the defense, and then react to those failures. The problem with this approach is it purely defensive, the enemy has the initiative. Honeypots attempts to change that. The primary purpose of honeypot is to gather information on threats. This information has defferent value for different organization.\n\nEg.\n\n\u00b7Academic research institution may use honeypot to gather data for research, such as worm activity.\n\n\u00b7Security organization may use honeypot to capture and analyze malware for anti-virus.\n\n\u00b7Government organization use them to learn more about who is targetting them and why???\n\nHoneynets are a prime example of high-interaction honeypot. Honeynets are not a product; they are not a software solution that you install on a computer. Instead, Honeyents are an architecture, an entire network of computers designed to attacked. The idea is to have an architecture that creates a highly controlled network, one where all activity is controlled and captured. Within this network we place our intended victims, real computers running real applications. The bad guys find, attack, and break into these systems on their own initiative. When they do, they do not realize they are within a Honeynet. All of their activity, from encrypted sessions to emails and files uploads, are captured without them knowing it. This is done by inserting kernel modules on the victim systems that capture all of the attacker's actions. At the same time, the Honeynet controls the attacker's activity. Honeynets do this using a Honeywall gateway. This gateway allows inbound traffic to the victim systems, but controls the outbound traffic using intrusion prevention technologies. This gives the attacker the flexibility to interact with the victim systems, but prevents the attacker from harming other non-Honeynet computers.\n\nHoneynet Architecture\n\nHoneynets are nothing more than an architecture. To succesfully deploy a honeynet; the honeynet architecture should be correctly deployed. The key to the honeynet architecture is what we call a \"honeywall\". This is a gateway device that seperates your honeypots from the rest of the world. Any traffic going to or from the honeypots must go through the honeywall. This gateway is traditionally a layer 2 bridging device, meaning the device should be invisible to anyone interacting with the honeypots. Below we see a diagram of this architecture. The Honeywall has 3 interfaces. The first 2\n\nThere are several key requirements that a honeywall must implement; Data Control, Data Capture, Data Analysis, Data Collection. Data Control defines how activity is contained with the honeynet without an attacker knowing it. Its purpose is to minimize risk. Data Capture is capturing all of the attacker's activity without the attacker knowing it. Data Analysis is the ability to analyze this data. Data Collection is the ability to collect data from multiple honeynets to a single source. Of all these requirements, Data Control is the more important. Data Control always takes priority as its role is to mitigate risk. We describe each in more detail below.\n\nvData Control is the containment of activity, it is what mitigates risk. By risk, we mean there is always the potential of an attacker or malicious code using a honeynet to attack or harm non-honeynet systems, or abusing the honeynet in some un-expected way. We want to make every effort possible to ensure that once an attacker is within our honeynet or a system is compromised, they cannot accidentally or purposefully harm other non-honeynet systems. The challenge is implementing data control while minimizing the attacker's or malcious's code chance of detecting it. This is more challenging then it seems. First, we have to allow the attackers some degree of freedom to act. The more activity we allow the attackers to perform, the more we can potentially learn about them. However, the more freedom you allow an attacker, the more risk there is they will circumvent Data Control and harm other non-honeynet systems. The balance of how much freedom to give the attacker vs. how much you restrict their activity is a decision every organization has to make themselves.\n\nvData Capture is the monitoring and logging of all of the threat's activities within the honeynet. It is this captured data that is then analyzed to learn the tools, tactics, and motives of attackers. The challenge is to capture as much data as possible without the threat detecting the process. As with Data Control, one of the primary lessons learned for Data Capture has been the use of layers. It is critical to use multiple mechanisms for capturing activity. Not only does the combination of layers help piece together all of the attacker's actions, but it prevents having a single point of failure. The more layers of information that are captured, at both the network and host level, the more that can be learned. To minimize the ability of attackers to detect our capture mechanisms, there are two ways: First, make as few modifications to the honeypots as possible. The more modifications you make, the greater the chance of detection. Second it is best that captured data not be stored locally on the honeypots themselves. Not only could this data be detected by attackers, but it could also be modified or deleted. As such, captured data must be logged and stored on a seperate, secured system.\n\nvData Analysis is the third requirement. Remember, the entire purpose of a honeynet is information. A honeynet is worthless if you have no ability to convert the data it collect to information, you must have some ability to analyze the data. Different organizations have different needs, and as such will have different data analysis requirements.\n\nvData Collection applies only to organizations that have multiple honeynets in distributed environments. Most organizations will have only one single honeynet, what we call a standalone deployment. As such they do not need to worry about Data Collection. However, organizations that have multiple honeynets logically or physically distributed around the world have to collect all of the captured data and store it in a central location. This way the captured data can be combined, exponentially increasing its value. The Data Collection requirement provides the secure means of centrally collecting all of the captured information from distributed honeynets.\n\nImplementing all of these requirements is extremely difficult, complex, and time consuming. In the past it took a great deal of time and effort to deploy such an architecture. However, today the Honeynet Project has developed a rapid and simple way for an organization to deploy such functionality, its call the Honeywall CDROM. The purpose of this bootable CDROM is to make it simple to rapidly build and deploy a honeywall, the critical component to honeynet architecture. You simply install the Honeywall CDROM into a computer with multiple NICs, and it automates the build process of a honeywall, implementing all of the requirements we just discussed above.\n\nAdvantages of Honeynet\n\n\u2022High Data Value\n\n\u00d8Small Data\n\n\u2022Low Resource Cost\n\n\u00d8Weak or Retired system\n\n\u2022Simple Concept, Flexible Implementation\n\n\u2022Return on Investment\n\n\u00d8Proof of Effectiveness\n\n\u2022Catch new attacks\n\nDisadvantages of honeynet\n\n\u2022In reference to risk, there are four general areas we will cover;\n\nvHarm: when a honey net is used to attack or or harm other, non-honey net systems.\n\nEg. An attacker may break into a honeynet, and then launch an outbound attack never seen before, successfully harming or compromising its intended victim.\n\nvDetection: Once the true identity of a honey net has been identified, its value is dramatically reduced. Attacker can ignore or bypass the honeynet, eliminating its capability for capturing information.\n\nvDisabling: Attackers may want to not only detect a honey net's identity, but disable its Data Control or Data Capture capabilities, potentially without the honeynet administrator knowing that functionality has been disabled (feed the honeypot with bogus activity, making administrator think that data capture is still functioning and recording activity when it is not.)\n\nEg. Attackers using a honeypot to upload then distribute illegal material. Remember, this individual broke into your system on their own initiative. If detected, this illegal activity would be attributed to you by way of it being on your system. You may then have to prove that it was in fact not you who was responsible for this activity."}

This has sparked questions about how safe the internet communications network is.\n\nSabotage has been ruled out by telecoms experts but the question about what damaged the cables has still not been answered, the International Herald Tribune (IHT) reports.\n\nAn early theory that the cables may have been cut by a ship passing by were quickly dismissed, and wear and tear has also been ruled out due to the relatively new cables.\n\nEven if it looks like it wasn't sabotage this time, \"what if it is tomorrow?\" Parihar asked. He pointed to the fact that internet and phone network cables are owned by private firms, and no one from a governmental or military level is protecting them.\n\nCommunications in the Middle East and India were worst hit by the cut cables, with Europe and the US also experiencing slower connection speeds.\n\nAlan Mauldin, research director with TeleGeography Research, called for cable routes to be diversified.

{"text":"Major types of Hacking\n\nHacking is basically a programming procedure through which a hacker can change any desired activity within the computer program and modify the software or hardware of one's OperatingSystem. There are actually many different hacking techniques available and each hacking attempt or procedure happens for different purposes.\n\nThe word hacker basically means a cyber attacker who assault on thecomputer's or network system security and manipulates the system accordingto their will. Hacking can be performed in several different platforms like in a personal computer, a website, emails, gadgets, wireless connection, personal accounts and even in mobile phones. Hackers' basically use different types of hacking software and programming algorithms to access and hackinto different kinds of platforms. So, here are few types of hacking that you'd like to know about :\n\nBlack Hat : This is actually one of the famous among all the different types of hacking. Black hat hacking is usually done to steal others' confidential information and break into protected systems.\n\nLegal Hacking or White Hat : This hacking is actually intentionally done to check for the vulanerability in one's system.\n\nGrey Hat : This is actually the combination of the both the above mentioned hacking. It is done using legal access to steal and modify unauthorized data.\n\nBlue Hat : This hacking is intentionally done by providing authority to a third party to check for bugs in your own system.\n\nScript Kiddie : These are normal very new to the scene, amateur hackers who use others' ideas and software for hacking.\n\nHacktivism : These are actually people who want to spread their beliefs and ideas in the form of message via the hacked system to other normal users.\n\nPhreaker : These hackers are actually limited to only Telecom hacking who actually play tricks with the telephone and make free ISD or STD calls.\n\nComputer Security Hacker : Hackers who know technical speciality of computer security and networking. They normally use fragmented packets to attack the firewall or ISP.\n\nNeophyte : Neophyte are actually the beginners in the hacking world, almost very new to the internet fundamentals.\n\nAcademic Hacker : These are persons who are actually monitoring and doing research about different types of hacking.\n\nHobby Hacker : These are actually normal users who are keen to unlock latest updates and applications. Like hacking done as a hobby like jail breaking done on Apple iPhones, modifying software\/ hardware etc.\n\nElite: The word \"Elite\" is actually stated to hackers who are expert on what they are doing."}

Chinese cyber warfare specialists.\n\nAccordingly, it is possible that the CIA had some influence, whether by intention or not.\n\nSince Iran is BFF with China, I placed them #4 for this reason.

Supposedly, the intruders burned out a pump by utilizing access to stolen credentials that gave them access to there SCADA software.\n\nIts widely known that critical infrastructure in America is severely insecure. There's been a call from many security professionals over the past decade to tighten security on these systems, and protect our infrastructure. With highly sophisticated malware being created to attack SCADA equipment, like Stuxnet and Duqu, its only a matter of time before these hacks start taking place more frequently.\n\nIts seems like the hackers were only \"testing the water\", sorry about the pun, with what they could do with their access. What if they wanted to do something more malicious to these systems besides breaking them? The water supply would reach thousands if not millions of people. What if they hit the power grid, and turned off power to parts of the country? These things, as unbelievable as they may seem, are what we're facing now.\n\nThe government is downplaying what happened here in Illinois, but they need to start securing their systems before innocent people die. This isn't a trojan thats going to steal your banking credentials. These hacks have the capability to stop a town and or state, and potentially harm the citizens living in them."}

In short, I'm the guy posting all the stories to this web-site.\n\nPart of my job is to search through articles from the Associated Press and other news organizations to see what would be relevant to Polk County readers. Football, politics, taxes and of course Wikileaks seem to come up a lot.\n\nLet's talk about Wikileaks.\n\nOne story that seems to keep coming up is that of a collective group of young, would-be freedom fighters from around the globe called Anonymous.\n\nRight now this group encourages people to download software onto their computers that adds them to a botnet in order to launch attacks on the web-sites of businesses that speak out against or cutoff support to Wikileaks.\n\nA botnet is a network of computers controlled by a single individual used to commit cyber-crimes like hacking encrypted data with raw computing power, or set up Denial of Service, DoS, attacks on web-sites where all the computers try to login to a targeted site in order to bog down its servers and shut it down, thereby denying its use to others.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, Anonymous represents the first time people have willingly allowed their computers to become part of a botnet.\n\nComputers are usually forcefully added to botnets unknown to the user because of some worm or other malicious code accidentally being downloaded along with an email or attachment.\n\nMembers of Anonymous claim that their attacks on companies such as Master Card or Visa aren't actually intended to harm infrastructures or even the businesses themselves in any way. Rather, they claim they just want to make a statement in favor of Wikileaks and against what they see as censorship.\n\nAs a journalist I can underestimate the sentiment. I hate censorship, even of stuff I don't agree with. But as a longtime tech enthusiast, I have to denounce each and every one of them as misguided fools.\n\nEveryone who has volunteered to be a part of this by downloading the software has surrendered control of his or her computer to a complete stranger.\n\nThese people claim they just want to support Julian Assange and Wikileaks. OK fine.\n\nHere's the problem, there is nothing stopping the person or persons in charge of Anonymous from using this gift-wrapped tool to commit crimes ranging from identity theft (including of the people within the botnet) to real attacks to critical sites.\n\nThere isn't any reason to believe they will simply give up this botnet after their point about Wikileaks has been made either.\n\nWhatever your stance is on Wikileaks, the people downloading this software are committing a crime. The people controlling this software are committing a crime (with the potential for much greater ones to come).\n\nTo sum it up: just like you wouldn't hand the keys of your car to some stranger that says he's going to use it as a getaway car for a bank robbery, you shouldn't give these people control of your PC."}

{"text":"Wharton Aerospace & Defense Report\n\nA dogfight over software is intensifying as the Pentagon reaffirmed that it will not share with partner countries the sensitive code that controls Lockheed Martin's F-35 radar-evading jet fighter, according to an article published by Reuters.\n\nBritain, which funded about $2 billion of the F-35, is among eight countries that co-financed the system. Nonetheless, no country will receive the source code or the vital electronics that control everything from weapons integration to radar to flight dynamics, according to the article.\n\nThe jet, known as the Joint Strike Fighter, can switch between air-to-ground and air-to-air missions in mid-flight, thanks to some eight million lines of code. The United States will provide a way for countries to upgrade the software as necessary without revealing the source code, Jon Schreiber, the head of the program's international affairs, told Reuters. \"Nobody is happy with it completely, but everybody's satisfied and understands,\" he said.\n\nIsrael, which is interested in buying the fighter, has proposed technology transfer as part of a possible purchase of seven F-35s. But that is unlikely, says Eric K. Clemons, a professor of operations and information management at Wharton. If F-35 software is shipped in its source form, other countries might try to reverse engineer and replicate the capabilities of the F-35 in far more detail than would be possible from observations of the plane in flight. Clemons says they could even try to jam or hack an \"enemy\" F-35. \"While [jamming or hacking it] is unlikely, the first two are near certainties,\" he said. \"Not only will the U.S., but also the UK, have a stronger defense if the software for the F-35 remains unavailable.\"\n\nWithholding the source code also protects hardware vendors from parties that clone the hardware system. For example, hardware vendors selling specific systems to China frequently provide only object code and not source code, which ensures that software must be upgraded or replaced regularly.\n\n\"This is done to prevent cloning,\" says Clemons, adding that if a buyer illegally recreates an entire system by reproducing parts, the software shuts down. \"The buyer needs to purchase an appropriate number of licenses, not merely the licenses for the number of hardware units legally purchases but also for the illegal clones.\""}

{"text":"Researchers studying the passwords exposed by the Christmas-day attack on the security firm Stratfor Global Intelligence say that many of the passwords have turned out to be \"simple and easy to decode.\"\n\nThat assessment comes from Utah Valley University's Kevin Young, area IT director and an adjunct professor who teaches information security. Using 120 computers, researchers at the university are decoding the encrypted passwords, which were revealed by a group purporting to be the AntiSec branch of Anonymous.\n\nThe story comes from PCWorld's Jeremy Kirk, who goes on to describe the weaknesses Young has found thusfar in short, simple passwords and in the MD5 hashing algorithm Stratfor employed to secure them:\n\nRather than store passwords in clear text, which is considered dangerous, Stratfor stored a cryptographic representation of victims' passwords called an MD5 hash, generally considered a wise security practice. Young set up the 120 computers in order to decode the MD5 password hashes released by the hackers.\n\nWith modest computing power and password cracking programs, many of those MD5 hashes can be decoded into their original password. The simpler and shorter the password, the faster it can be decoded.\n\nWhile MD5 is still a widely used cryptographic hash function, it's not perfect. Design flaws were found as early as 1996, and US-CERT has since said that the function \"should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.\" Most U.S. government applications now require the SHA-2 family of hash functions.\n\nOf course, as Young pointed out to Kirk, what makes the imperfect hashing scenario particularly worrisome is that the computing power employed by the university pales in comparison to what a nation state can throw at a decryption target.\n\nAccording to the LA Times, Anonymous late last month released two batches of account information on 860,000 Stratfor subscribers.\n\nThose subscribers include many officials who are central to the country's financial system, holders of intellectual property, and\/or instrumental to the United States's national defense.\n\nGiven that Stratfor analyzes national and international affairs, it counts among its clientele hundreds of U.S. intelligence, law enforcement and military officials, including the U.S. State Department; international banks such as Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase; and tech companies such as IBM and Microsoft.\n\nAnonymous revealed email addresses, names and credit card numbers belonging to some 75,000 customers, including former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.\n\nAs Kirk points out, the credit card data is of ephemeral value to criminals. It's the email addresses and cracked passwords that could enable malicious actors to identify some of Stratfor's subscribers and to potentially impersonate them in cyberspace.\n\nYoung told Kirk that he's decoded more than 160,000 Stratfor passwords, with many of the weak passwords belonging to those in organizations such as the U.S. Marine Corps, where the creation of a safe password should be well-understood and well-implemented.\n\nTime for a reminder on how to create a safe password. In a nutshell:\n\nUse a minimum of eight or nine characters.\n\nMix upper- and lower-case letters.\n\nUse numbers and\/or punctuation.\n\nNever use the same password twice.\n\nYou can Frankenstein yourself a delightfully ungainly beast this way. An example: One of my previous passwords is Tb=0tS2!\n\nHow did I ever remember it? That nonsense string contains the first letters of a sentence in which I've swapped the first letter of each word for the entire word, thus foiling brute-force dictionary decryption.\n\nThere's more to it than that, of course. Sophos's Graham Cluley outlines the technique in this video.\n\n\"Stratfor stored a cryptographic representation of victims' passwords called an MD5 hash, generally considered a wise security practice.\"\n\nThat does not sound right.\n\nWe cracked 111,429 of the STRATFOR's MD5 hashes under 40 seconds with a large password dictionary, and many more in minutes after that using incremental cracking mode with John the Ripper. We stopped at 200k passwords. So, yea, they were really weak.\n\nThere's some misunderstanding in this article. The first is the belief something hashed with MD5 was actually decoded, and that security was compromised because of that particular algorithm. As far as I know, it's almost impossible to decode something hashed with MD5, as it's simply not reversible.\nHowever, it is possible to keep generating values until there's a match with a given value, or to find two inputs that return the same hash, which is the 'collision attack' you were referring to.\n\nThe actual method for cracking Stratfor's passwords was to keep hashing dictionary words, variations and possibilities, until there's a match with an MD5 entry in the password database. This same method is effective against MD5, SHA and SHA2, so changing the algorithm does nothing to improve security if weak passwords are still used.\n\nFor passwords that aren't horribly weak (nothing is going to help a password of \"Password123\"), SHA1 and SHA2 do provide advantages over MD5 for three reasons:\n1. MD5 produces a 128-bit digest. SHA1 = 160-bit. SHA2 = 224 to 512-bit. Longer digest = more possible digest values = lower chance of a collision.\n2. There are known weaknesses in MD5 that significantly decrease the number of calculations needed in order to find a collision.\n3. MD5 is computationally easier than SHA1, which in turn is easier than SHA2. This means with the same amount of processing power, you can grind through many more possible MD5 values than SHA1\/SHA2.  has a nice table showing relative real-world computation speeds.\n\nMartin Bos (@PureHate_) announced he had recovered passwords for 92.22% of the Stratfor accounts back on Jan 3rd. I'd put money on him using oclHashcat-lite and at least one Radeon HD 5970. @hashcat reported hitting a record rate of 9.95B MD5 hashes\/sec using that card on Jan 4th.\n\nUsing 120 computers to break only 160,000 passwords?!???! I used one machine that doesn't have the most modern gpu's to gather just over 300,000 total before I stopped. I used my own dictionaries, then brute forced the entire 1-7 password length space using the upper \/ lower alphanumeric character set. This was with only 700 million hashes per second, newer ati hardware can exceed 5 billion hashes per second per gpu. Even my laptop with a mobile nvidia card can exceed 85M hps. They need a new IT director even in his example Tb=0tS2! is only 8 characters long if his hash was leaked it would only take an attacker with a few current gen gpu's a day or two at max to break this. One hash cracking group is already known to have completed over 92% of the entire leaked data set and that was as of 3 days ago.\n\nI too, thought he was an idiot at first so I clarified it with the researcher. The 120 machines were creating 8,9, and 10 char sequential wordlists - until the researcher exhausted his 50TB allotment.\nHe fed both generated and existing wordlists into both JTR and oclHashCat (for speed comparison purposes). I have no idea how many he's since cracked.\nHis research was more about the quality, entropy, and complexity (and the lack thereof) than the quantity.\n\nIf you want to secure your data I would suggest keeping it offline and not on a networked PC. I keep my info on an encrypted USB stick, and it's only accessable during the times I need it. Much harder to get the data that is not there all the time.\n\nIt's amazing how this group seems to get around, and not anyone has anything to trace. Most of the Companies targeted are large, who think they have security under control by paying a guy thousands a year. While the $8\/hr employee has insight to get around network security, and gives the hacker a free ride in. On top of the fact the IT Admin probably had no intentions of checking logs, or going about doing anything other than email to the subscribers to change their passwords because of the security breech. I bet he is still working there and got nothing more than a slap on the wrist. The Security Breech means they where not doing the job, and your paying these people for what?\n\nI get plenty of false security breeches and end up shutting people out of my network because it was suspicious activity, even for legit users.\n\nReally you can only be anonymous for so long before someone traces the steps back.\n\nAlso as I exited I thought of something else. All the security questions that websites use for password recovery can be figured out by knowing someone, and every site uses the same basic questions. I can get a lot of information right off facebook. (What highschool did you go to. Favorite food. Mothers Madien name. Favorite Hobby, pets name, etc). I bet I can get 8\/10 friends passwords in less than 30 mins if they where all on the same site, using password recovery and quick guesses.\n\nI usually choose the ones that have an ever occuring change, and require me to know when I created the account to know what I liked or was doing then. Favorite Hobby could be reading today, be rock climbing tomorrow, and building snowmen on Saturday. It makes it harder for even me to remember my passwords, but knowing I created the account on 05\/06\/2003 and I know exactly what I was doing and what I was thinking at the time.\n\nDon't store password not even on a flash disk that can be turned to network disk, don't type password a key logger can send a copy of it somewhere, instead use a password generator to fill that field every time you login.

{"text":"This week the PBS website was hacked with a funny message, a fake news story about Tu Pac being still alive, and the revelation of a bunch of usernames and passwords. Apparently this was in retaliation to PBS's wikileaks documentary, which the hackers disagreed with.\n\nThose are the facts here. So should these hackers be caught, what is the crime? It's clearly illegal, but is the punishment closer to a federal offense (creating fake news could be a serious problem) or closer to holding an illegal protest (which is a small fine and a night in jail). No real harm was done here, no permanent damage and while revealing usernames and passwords is annoying; the PBS login info doesn't contain anything like credit card info.\n\nI see this kind of hacking closer to graffiti and public protests than I do \"real crime.\" It's hard to compare this to something like robbery, such as the PSN hack last month which stole thousands of credit card numbers and caused millions in damages. However, it should be noted that it's a very small leap to go from a funny news posting to, if they had left the site alone, and posted a \"real\" news story that caused people to actually panic. Orson Well's War of the Worlds caused that kind of panic and was redone by a group in South America - only this time the result was even more pronounced, with people committing suicide to save themselves from the alien invasion. This was followed by a major legal battle to hold the communications company liable for their deaths (Third degree murder in this case).\n\nWhere do you see the line being drawn? Was the attack on PBS a peaceful way to protest their coverage (or miscoverage, depending on who you believe) of the WikiLeaks story? Could there be a better way to draw attention to the dissenters that would have been less damaging? Who is liable for the breach of security? Should PBS be held accountable for any damages that may occur or should the hackers?\n\nThe laws around the internet are just being formed still. A lot of you who are not old enough to vote yet will be very involved with the creation of these laws: We should all pay very close attention to internet security, as it will massively be impacting our lives over the next century and likely beyond.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on web based hacks?

Your passwords don't really protect you, but don't worry: Amaranth Games doesn't keep any of your credit card info. No fooling."}

Hackers\n\nIt may seem like it now but in the near future once everyone begins to realize how dependent the world is on technology, they will also find out how powerful hackers truly are. Code is basically another language so to non-programmers everything looks like something from another planet. But to the actual programmers a few clicks and edits here and there and the entire program could become something totally different. The thing about hackers is they don't always need to change the code of a program to get what they want, they could just create a program from scratch that does the dirty work for them.\n\nFor example, there was a 17 year old boy named Pearce Delphin who made a worm that allowed hackers to send Twitter users to Japanese porn sites just \"to see if it could be done\". It all started when Delphin tweeted some 'mouseover' JavaScript which brings up a pop-up window when the cursor is placed over the text.

{"text":"For example, in May a mannequin company in Brooklyn, N.Y., lost $1.2 million in just a few hours. Verizon (VZ) analyzed hundreds of data breaches in 2010 and found that 63 percent of them happened at companies that had 100 or fewer employees.\n\nThis isn't entirely new. I spoke with Kevin Haley, a director with Symantec Security Response, earlier this year. He cited company research showing that only 13 percent of 1,900 SMBs the security software maker had surveyed felt completely protected against computer threats. Related Symantec studies also have showed that 40 percent of targeted online attacks had gone after smaller businesses.\n\nCriminal hackers, like bank robber Willie Sutton, not only want to go where the money is -- they also want to be sure they can get at it. Small and midsize businesses are perfect prey. Not only do they tend to lack the resources to fully secure their computer systems, but they also tend to have significant amounts of money.\n\nIf things weren't tough enough for SMBs, they're getting worse. According to a report from computer security company McAfee, a unit of Intel (INTC), and online banking security vendor Guardian Analytics, hackers are using fraud automation to increase the power and speed of their attacks. Tools also abound on hacker sites to help people illegally tap into company information networks.\n\nThe solution? There may not be one, and for the same reasons that large companies remain vulnerable. Computer security is expensive. To many executives, it's a black hole for spending. Even big companies with significant IT staffs have difficulty keeping up with all the changes, updates, modifications, and upgrades necessary to keep up with the world of criminal hacking.\n\nSo the challenge for smaller companies is daunting. The best bet may be for SMBs to shore up their systems just enough to encourage criminals look for easier pickings. It's like the old story about being with a group of people attacked by a bear: You don't have to run faster than the bear, just faster than most of the other people you're with outlook for small businesses in regards to IT security certainly is daunting. Small business owners tend to shy away from investing in proven IT solutions for one of two reasons: 1) they can't afford enterprise-level solutions; and 2) they don't understand the depth and risks of cyber crime threats. I think you make a great point in acknowledging that small businesses, especially, operate under the \"it can't happen to me\" mentality. In-house personnel wear so many different hats that adequate attention to the security of their network infrastructure is often overlooked. It will be increasingly important for security vendors to create the need and inform SMBs--to not overlook the little guys.

Access issues occur because Google and other search engines track websites that contain malware and bots, and remove them from the search engine.\n\nIn order to prevent hacking, the report said users should first ensure they are working with a virtual server hosting provider that focuses heavily on providing a secure solution. Not all web hosts are equal in this regard, and security should be a priority for webmasters. The report also said administrators should be purposeful about their creation and distribution of passwords, making sure their hosting solution is difficult to access through password theft.\n\nHackers frequently use keylogging programs that can monitor every keyboard stroke and identify passwords to gain access to a user's web hosting solution, the Web Hosting Geeks report. The report said passwords should be complex and change often to prevent keylogging from being effective."}
{"text":"Cybersecurity has been getting a lot of attention in recent years after a number of corporations and government websites have undergone security breaches. In fact, Congress is even weighing the idea of cybersecurity legislation in an effort to prevent against cyber warfare.\n\nJerry Brito, however, who is the Director of the Technology Policy Program at George Mason University, believes that the hype is overblown. He has studied the area extensively but told us that, while there is a very real threat in cybersecurity, the concerns that the government is suggesting are exaggerated.\n\nAs he explained, some government officials have equated the current threats to Pearl Harbor or September 11, 2001, which he believes is misleading based on the evidence. According to him, the cyber threats that would have a catastrophic impact like 9\/11 did are few and far between. Although the others, namely distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and cyber espionage, are harmful, Brito said they do not lead to mass casualties.\n\nFor this reason, he told us that legislation that would require companies to secure their networks based on a government standard is not needed. He said companies are aware of the threats that exist and are capable of protecting themselves.\n\nBrito did point out that he would like to see the barriers broken down that would allow companies and the federal government to share information with one another in a way that would maintain consumer privacy protections."}
{"text":"Many recent cyber attacks could have been avoided if businesses were more focused on their security efforts, but users seem not to learn from their mistakes, according to Richard Mogull research director for Gartner.\n\n\"Patches were available to protect systems against the Code Red virus, but had generally not been deployed,\" Mogull said.\n\nWorse, the Nimda virus exploited exactly the same weakness a few months later and was still able to cause havoc around the world. Combined losses from the two incidents are estimated at running into billions of dollars, largely due to user indifference, according to Mogull.\n\nThe five top vulnerabilities to cyberattacks include: lack of risk management integration; security not integrated into projects; poor governance and culture; weak security of suppliers and partners; and no benchmarking on spending and value of security projects.\n\nTo counter these vulnerabilities, users should take steps including: increasing the enterprise's overall security posture; developing an internal response plan and aggressively monitor internet activity on all systems, especially firewall and intrusion detection logs; evaluating established security plans in light of recent events, and update as needed; and form a cyber-incident response team or contracting with an external provider to evaluate systems.\n\nAround 90 percent of cyber attacks will continue to exploit known security flaws for which a patch is available or a preventive measure known until 2005, according to Gartner.\n\nDuring that time, 20 percent of enterprises will experience a serious internet security incident - defined as one which is more than a virus attack. Of companies suffering incidents, the cleanup costs of the incident will exceed the prevention costs by 50 percent"}
{"text":"2013\/01\/16\n\nThousands of Internet users' systems all over the world are hacked every day. In the past few years, there has been a substantial rise in hacker activity from overseas. This makes strong cyber security a prerequisite to connecting your devices to the Internet. As more cyberattacks originate from international locations, businesses must make sure that their antivirus protection and other security paradigms are strong enough to handle the increased threat. Keep the following things in mind about this wave of international computer hacking.\n\nIt Can Be Huge in Scope\n\nAccording to a 2012 Verizon investigation, 174 million records were compromised from hundreds of separate companies. Almost all of these companies were discovered to have had shortcomings in their own cyber-security measures. While exact estimates on this sort of activity are obviously hard to come by, Interpol and other organizations have released numbers that peg the approximate damage to businesses in the tens of billions of dollars annually. In most cases, someone at the organization brings a virus or other malware into the system because they have either not been trained properly or security is not at an adequate level. This virus then acts as a door that lets hackers into the system \u2014 where they can wreak havoc and steal data.\n\nNo One Is Immune\n\nAs demonstrated by a slew of major hacks of some of the largest online companies, such as Yahoo! and LinkedIn, there is no organization too large to suffer from cyber-threats. However, large businesses are not always the targets, and smaller businesses have just as much to fear. For one thing, their expertise in security and antivirus measures is not likely to be as high or their budget for establishing proper digital security measures as expansive. Consequently, sometimes smaller businesses decide to cut corners, but this is never a good solution. The businesses that do this fail to grasp that even if they are fairly small and insignificant targets, all it takes is one serious breach to have major consequences. The results can range from monetary theft, legal liability, reputation damage or physical damage to the computer systems themselves.\n\nWhere It Comes From\n\nAccording to USA Today, China takes the lead in the origination of most of today's cyber infractions, but it is certainly not the only country from which these sophisticated hacks arise. As the general public becomes more technologically savvy, with better and more frequent access to the digital realm, cybercrime will only continue to rise. Thus, security measures must evolve to counteract this.\n\nHow to Protect Yourself\n\nGiven this rise in threats to the security of your digital network, how should your business respond? The first step is to take it seriously. Make an honest appraisal of your security protocols, and if you are vulnerable, you should immediately begin working on a plan to address the most glaring flaws. In most cases, this begins with a thorough review of your antivirus software. Is it installed on all the devices that connect to your network? Have the installations and virus definitions been kept up-to-date? If they have, you are significantly less vulnerable to international hacking, as most of these threats are automated in nature and rely on targets not having security measures.\n\nPerform an audit of your computer security immediately if you want to remain safe from the rising threat of international hackers eager to damage your website and company. Don't forget to also include an anti-malware and anti-spyware solution alongside your antivirus software for the best results.\n\nMarie Gannett has been blogging about computer security issues for several years. She uses Trend Micro Security Software to keep her system safe from threats."}

{"text":"It's hard to even begin to summarize coverage on Wikileaks-related stuff today. But if you read one thing, read Marc Thiessen's fresh item at the Washington Post. It's not the fact that he's vigorously opposed to Wikileaks that's interesting, but rather his understanding of the technology at the heart of this entire saga:\n\nSome say attacking WikiLeaks would be fruitless. Really? In the past year, the Iranian nuclear system has been crippled by a computer worm called \"Stuxnet,\" which has attacked Iran's industrial systems and the personal computers of Iranian nuclear scientists. To this day, no one has traced the origin of the worm. Imagine the impact on WikiLeaks's ability to distribute additional classified information if its systems were suddenly and mysteriously infected by a worm that would fry the computer of anyone who downloaded the documents. WikiLeaks would probably have very few future visitors to its Web site.\n\nIt all gives me this vision of Thiessen dreaming about single-handedly stopping Wikileaks by typing \"OVERRIDE PASSWORD\" into Julian Assange's laptop, then hitting the delete button after a stern British female voice declares \"ACCESS GRANTED.\" Then there is a tense moment as a glowing neon blue progress bar slowly deletes Wikileaks, but will it finish before Julian returns from the virtual reality cyber conference with George Soros where they are laughing about having just gotten an oblivious Julian Sands thrown in jail?\n\nMore at Boing Boing\n\nJeff Goldblum's skull.exe can ruin any computer, just like those aliens that were using OSX.\n\nBrendon J. Wilson\n\nAlright, so maybe he's mildly confused about the exact mechanism this might be achieved, but the vitriol loaded on him here is uncalled for.\n\nThere are a variety of completely realistic and feasible ways you could achieve the goal he outlines, or at least come sufficiently close to make a lot of government people very happy. A drive-by-download was identified above as one way, but that would require compromising WikiLeak's own servers \u2013 not impossible, especially if you consider that the complexity of Stuxnet indicates it was likely a state-sanctioned attack (4 zero-day exploits used in that attack).\n\nOne only has to look at the challenges the banking industry faces with attacks on their online customer portals for an idea of other ways an attack might be perpetrated. Spear-phishing, man-in-the-browser attacks, poisoned local DNS settings, and even good ol' social engineering attacks would all be good ways to either render users unable to visit WikiLeaks or even install software capable of monitoring and severely punishing those who attempt to download WikiLeaks docs.\n\nI'm not suggesting this would be an all-encompassing way to achieve the goal. However, when you consider that millions of people's machines are parts of illicit botnets without their knowledge, you can't completely disregard the possibility that there exist some means to achieve a large part of his stated goal by infecting a large number of users' machines in a fashion that rendered them incapable of browsing, downloading, or storing Wikileaks documents.\n\nHe may be somewhat ill-informed for not knowing exactly how it might be achieved, but I expect BoingBoing readers to at least show some of their usual imagination and recognize he's not completely off target.\n\nbjacques\n\nThat's it! Throw vitriol at Julian's monitor! I saw Superman take out a PC by putting his fist through the monitor.\n\nAlternatively, take Wikileaks to Internet Court and file a writ of cybernetic estoppel. Damn, I wish I could remember the rest of that quote.\n\nMark\n\nHe's gonna hack the Gibson so he can back trace you.\n\nGraham Anderson\n\nSurely the voice of the computer would be Majel Roddenberry?\n\nMrJM\n\nDon't you people understand?\n\nThe Internet is not something that you just dump something on.\n\nIt's not a big truck.\n\nbrielle\n\nI see someone's been watching reruns of 24 and CSI\u2026\n\nI stopped watching 24 after getting tired of hearing such classic phrases like \"He's using static NAT mapping in the global Internet routing tables to hack the Internet!\"\n\nSonOfSamSeaborn\n\n24 had me screaming at the bad IT a few times, but at least they researched existing, current terminology before raping it out of existence.\n\nI had, however, forgotten the time all the green Matrix symbols on the screen went red and the immediate conclusion was \"looks like someone's tryin' to hack the Internet\".\n\nAnonymous\n\nA virus would get detected by all of the infallible anti-virus programs everyone is running. We should detonate nuclear devices above every major city in the world so the EMP would destroy any Wikileaks viewing device!\n\nigpajo\n\nI was thinking today that there's no way to stop or delete the stuff that's already out there, but how hard would it be for someone to create something that corrupts that encrypted \"nuclear option\" file that has been downloaded thousands of times. You know the Gov'ment's got people trying to crack that thing. Could they fake a release of keycode in an effort to trick the folks who want to open that thing into running it instead. But instead of opening the file, it destroys it.\nI have no idea what if what I'm talking about is possible or not, am on the fence as to whether it would be a moral thing or not to release some fake key, just curious to know if something like that might be possible.\nProbably wouldn't be worth the effort because the first person to try it would spread the word and it would become ineffective almost immediately.\n\nThis rubbish was being propagated by NPR this morning, quoting some guy said to be at the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nAmandaraqs\n\nQuestion one: Who on the planet hasn't ALREADY gotten the insurance file? (And for the more paranoid among us, who hasn't already copied it to a half dozen flash drives?)\n\nSo even if a worm were released, how would it affect those who already have the file encased in carbonite and hidden in a safe deposit box?\n\nQuestion two: What he's advocating is illegal. The Post accepts Mastercard & Visa for subscriptions. Why have the credit card companies not yanked the Post's ability to process credit card transactions for subscriptions?\n\nllamatron\n\nJeff Goldblum has the necessary skills.

But, I couldn't really tell bc I couldn't really understand what he was saying. Maybe I get the concept, but its his execution that has me confused\u2026OK, the concept's a little fuzzy too.\n\nSomething like,\n\"There are a series of tubes and all we have to do is find Mr. Assange's and shit in them\"?\n\nXenu\n\nSo many problems with this idea \u2014 different operating systems, browsers, etc. Stuxnet just dealt with one platform and targeted one piece of software.\n\nMichael Smith\n\nSo many problems with this idea \u2014 different operating systems, browsers, etc. Stuxnet just dealt with one platform and targeted one piece of software.\n\nThe other problem is called Julian.

They are from such a linear-authoritarian-frequentist perspective they can't understand that this cannot be stopped. They don't understand that there already freely available and easy to use tools like TOR and Freenet which make it impossible to censor information from people who seriously seek it.\n\nIts also sad that we have an age where the olds in the MSM don't understand the internet at all. Its such a ludicrous kind of ignorance today. Its the equivalent of not knowing how a telephone works or how the post office works.\n\nbhtooefr\n\nThere actually is a way for them to make this much, much harder to spread the leaks.\n\nShut down the Internet.

He was great in Warlock.\n\nJonathan\n\nSour grapes? (in addition to general idiocy)\n\nThe Washington Post wasn't offered access to the State Department cables, said Marcus Brauchli, the newspaper's top editor. Brauchli said The Post contacted the Guardian to explore a cooperative arrangement before the documents' public release, \"but they declined to share [documents] with us.\" Representatives for the Guardian could not be reached for comment.\n\nIt's been a while since I saw the Lone Gunmen pilot, but I seem to remember the bad guys tracing where the Gunmen were by standing in a corridor with walls made of server terminals and then (very slowly) transferring USERINFO.TXT (or some such piffle, it was definitely a text file) into their own dastardly hands.\n\nOf course, just like with real-life plain text, when the connection was severed the file was lost.\n\nCeronomus\n\nThe Lone Gunman pilot, where they race to stop a US Government plot to fly a jetliner into the World Trade Center so as to force a worldwide war on terror.\n\nCreepy ehh?\n\nOf course, what is amazing about this story is the whole, fry people's computers part. Let's just say that this WERE possible. Then it would still be easier to have zombied computers log into Wikileaks and fry massive numbers of innocent machines.\n\nEven in a fantasy world this is a bad idea.\n\nspocko\n\nI prefer the pilot from \"Seven Days\" where the plane loaded with explosives flies into the White House. Then our hero travels back in time seven days and fixes the problem.\n\nI often wondered about what happened in the universe where the hero started. They had a world where the attacks succeeded. Wait, that's OUR universe!!!\n\nI often wondered if we had the ability to travel back in time and fix something and they only had the ability to stop one of the planes which would they do. The one that was targeted to the White House or the ones at the Pentagon and the two at the twin towers.\n\nA very widespread worm that contained copies of very unique portions of key documents (it would be a rather large one, but smaller than a youtube video) could continuously check new files to see if they contain matching portions, and if they do, do something nasty (or simply delete them? maybe replace the whole file with \"STOP SNITCHING\"). It's not completely impossible, though for a worm to seek out and infect only systems that already have copies of such documents is. An easier way to go about this is just to make a fake mirror of the cablegate documents and stick something in there that after a delay (long enough for the compromised copy to potentially be mirrored by someone else) does something nasty.\n\n'Frying' the machine isn't practical, and I don't know enough about this politician to know whether he knows that (and isn't using it literally) or has been advised by the same guy who told Kennedy that the internet was not a big big truck, but doing nasty things is quite practical (especially with the windows monoculture).\n\nSamSam\n\nWell, to play devil's advocate, the CIA could decide to write some viruses and seed them on torrent called \"Wikileaks cablegate\" or whatever it's called, and use their hundreds of computers to keep it well-peered and near the top. And every time they get too many downvotes or people catch on and say \"the NEW wikileaks torrent is called 'Assange Rulez!'\" they simply update their torrents.\n\nPlay that game enough and surely it would put a pretty quick stop to people sharing the files through torrents. No?\n\nAbleBakerCharlie\n\nWouldn't work-at least against a cautious opponent. All the big documents dumps come along with a half dozen different hashes from various functions- hashes that are well-posted on the 700+ mirrors running at this point. Internally of course, WikiLeaks is using some of the best put-together security and crypto paranoid nerds can devise- I doubt the NSA does better.\n\nSamSam\n\n\u2026oh, also the CIA's torrent virus would need to say in big letters \"YOU HAVE BEEN BACKTRACED TO THE CYBER POLICE! CONSEQUENCES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!\" if they really want to scare the downloaders.\n\njonw\n\nHas anyone considered bringing in the cyber police?\n\nkjh\n\nI type the magical password \"PATRIOT ACT\" and I have control of the banks \u2026.\n\nOh wait, it's true.\n\nAnonymous\n\nWell, doesn't this just add to the day's irony overload\u2026\n\nThe concept of a computer \"worm\" was introduced and receives its name from John Brunner's 1975 novel \"The Shockwave Rider\" in which a self-replicating program is deployed to expose government secrets to everyone on the network.\n\nvictorvodka\n\nif Thiessen's idea is so brilliant, why can't it be used to take out enemies most of us would agree are worse than wikileaks. how about a computer virus that infects the old operating systems on AK-47 assault rifles, and turn it against the Taliban and Osama B. Laden? How about a computer virus that magically attaches to child pornography that makes your computer into a thermonuclear device that explodes and not only takes out the pedophile, but all the people not ratting him out (or showing up on his front porch as an angry mob) in the neighborhood?\n\nAnonymous\n\nWow! that's such a powerful virus that it caused the Washington Post app to vanish from my Ipad. It's called the life is too short to listen to idiots like Marc Thiessen virus.\n\nChan Lee Meng\n\nThiessen's understanding of technology is poor, and possibly based on movie cliches.\n\nBut the \"virus\" he envisions already exists in the form of \"drive-by downloads\". OS and browser security holes allow hackers to install spyware, virus or other kind of malware when users visit a website.\n\nOf course, for that to work on Wikileaks, the hackers would need to compromise its servers and install a malware payload. I'm pretty sure plans are afoot to do just that. Then again, this is a threat which every major website faces.\n\nMalware won't \"fry\" your PC, but it can still delete all your data. Make sure you apply those security patches and keep your AV updated!\n\nColHapablap\n\nTrue, while this is a stupid idea, it is at least technically possible. The same thing happened recently with the popular ProFTPD source code, which was replaced with a compromised version including a backdoor. If they could hack the Wikileaks servers (wherever they may be\u2026), they could replace the cables with infected files that exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader, Windows, Linux, etc. to just brick a person's system. Again, this idea is neither good nor practical, but it's at least feasible, (probably) unbeknownst to him.\n\nmdh\n\nthat Assange dun messed up.\n\nseyo\n\ngive the well established FACT that the internets is as series of tubes, it is totally plausible that wikileaks' servers could be infected with a worm that would fry peoples' computers, and I mean, fried to a crisp! and you're damn straight, no one would want to go to their site anymore in that event. I don't know what you all are getting on this guy about. he clearly knows what he's talking about.\n\nAnonymous\n\nisn't that the guy who said that guantanamo inmates have no right to a lawyer because they are not charged with a crime but held as enemy combattants?\n\nfrom his couple of minutes on the daily show he looks to me like somebody who concentrates on getting his point through, not necessarily on understanding a situation.\n\n.~.\n\nsloverlord\n\nsingle-handedly stopping Wikileaks by typing \"OVERRIDE PASSWORD\"\n\nWhy go to all that trouble? The password is always swordfish.\n\nstrandedlad\n\nExcept when it's the name of someone in a photo sitting right by the computer.\n\nSomeone send him a delete system32 batch file as an attachment already and see if he opens it.\n\nAnonymous\n\nThe hackergroup that released the wikileaks files also the people attacking wikileaks servers and probably uploaded some fake files to the wikileak server too with virus injected to image\/video etc. and could be done in video too so youtube probably there next goal..\n\nFacebook has been under attack and will get problems when they attack there too i personally downloaded there bad ass wikileaks files in my stupidness and now my computer is dead i mean total dead tried resetting bios, lowlevel formatting, 3 different harddrives etc. etc. nothing helps just restart everytime it tries to write to disc.\n\nSo enjoy your youtube and facebook fun as long it last.\n\nTEKNA2007\n\nLet me know when WikiLeaks is responsible for a number of deaths even approaching the number of just 10-year-olds \u2014 little boys and girls \u2014 killed in the Middle East by U.S. and coalition forces during the adventures of the last ten years.\n\nI'd love to see a reporter have the balls to say something like this to P.J. Crowley: \"We've seen from the cables, over and over, in case after case, that what the State Department is saying publicly is very different from the truth you recognize internally. So why should we believe what you're saying? Why should we think you aren't lying right here, right now?\" The only problem is that a reporter who asks real questions eventually doesn't get asked back. Which is why we need WikiLeaks to get to the real bottom of things and do the real reporting. Because they don't give a shit. You get to the truth when you take the self-interest out of it.\n\nbardfinn\n\nThat name sounds so familiar.\n\nOh, yeah, here we go: \"Marc A.

But in the cyber realm, we've never had the courage to call\nit what it is.\n\nThese guys are not Robin Hood. There are many things the COULD do... like exposing the drug cartels in Mexico that murder their own people by the\ndozens every day. Then there are places like Tibet, where the Chinese have all but so diluted the population in the same way Hitler tried to in Poland\nand the Balkans, that Tibetans are now almost a minority.\n\nWhere are these heroes? Hacking banks and businesses.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, I had my ID stolen, my bank account emptied... I lost my car and almost my home. Six years later, the hacker had not been\nidentified except they lived somewhere in Eastern Europe.\n\nYou want heroes like this? You can have them. I hope they are all locked away someday.\n\nYep. Maybe they have a reclusive supplier of ohday every now and then to keep them going.\n\nBottom line for \"Anonymous\" -- none of their actions have caused any meaningful change.\n\nTheir last \"OpLastResort\" -- a complete farce. No redacted docs, no encryption keys. Nada. Nothing. Except blah blah blah. Maybe someone can point\nto one instance of Anon releasing any damning docs to make any change happen? I don't know of it.\n\nProbably a psy op. If not, then just some script kids getting lucky with some random machines after nmapping some"}
{"text":"Security quotes of the week\n\n[Posted February 6, 2013 by jake]\n\nI continue to be amazed that elected officials can read constant articles\nabout hacking, and yet readily accept the assurances that there will be no\nproblems with internet voting. If the SBE [State Board of Elections] is so\ngood at stopping attacks,\nperhaps they should supplement their paltry budget by providing security\nfor banks, Federal government agencies like DOD [Departement of Defense],\nand the nation's leading\nnewspapers!\n\nThe Internet's design isn't fixed by natural laws. Its history is a\nfortuitous accident: an initial lack of commercial interests, governmental\nbenign neglect, military requirements for survivability and resilience, and\nthe natural inclination of computer engineers to build open systems that\nwork simply and easily. This mix of forces that created yesterday's\nInternet will not be trusted to create tomorrow's. Battles over the future\nof the Internet are going on right now: in legislatures around the world,\nin international organizations like the International Telecommunications\nUnion and the World Trade Organization, and in Internet standards\nbodies. The Internet is what we make it, and is constantly being recreated\nby organizations, companies, and countries with specific interests and\nagendas. Either we fight for a seat at the table, or the future of the\nInternet becomes something that is done to us.\n\nTechnTheGood luck getting Joe Public to figure out and handle a public key :) Especially when any software he uses will now be a huge spyware target.\n\nAnd of course, this is in addition to the requirement that all code be correct and open and securely installed ...\n\n> I also have no doubt that the government will never, ever, be able to accomplish this task.\n\nI think that, even if you had a private board of cryptographers, security researchers and programmers, with infinity money and a love of democracy, you'd still be unable to produce a system the public could use.\n\n> Alternately, you could allow multiple votes and only count the most recent one, which is easy to do if everybody has a unique encryption key.\n\n\"most recent\" what does that mean? You've just moved a problem in security into one of atomicity and global timekeeping. I think Einstein would have some thoughts on how plausible this approach would be.\n\nThe obvious question is \"hash chains of what?\" I think you are pretty aware of one major challenge which is simplicity in that you earlier said:\n\n> TheSo lets replace \"time YYY\" with \"most recent publicized hash base.\" It needs to be something public otherwise Fox News would have a field day. Pay a bunch of people to vote for Obama and submit that, and then wait until after the results are announced to produce a few thousand new votes properly signed with the government public key, and chained against the individuals previous vote in the register that are for Romney. THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED!!!! VOTERS CHANGING TO ROMNEY DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY!!!!!\n\nSo the government manages a clock\/checkpoint which takes in all votes V_i arriving at time T, computes and publicizes a hash H_{T+1}=H(H_{T},V_1,...,V_n), and each vote includes as part of its signature H_{t} for some publicized t. If the vote has a stale Hash as the base to its signature I should reject it and notify the voter to resubmit.\n\nThere is still a synchronization point, but at least people will know about a failed vote and can resubmit. The problem here is that its split one vote counting problem into a few thousand vote counting problems. Every Joe who submits his vote at 11:59pm and sees it rejected is going to think he was targeted in his vote denial and not that his web connection was a bit slow.\n\nThere is also no simple way to verify that H_T was properly computed from the incoming votes and previous hash values. Independent observers will see votes arrive in a different order than the official hashing agent, and will compute different hashes as a result. Trying to reconcile that is going to be a mess and cause people to lose confidence in the system. My Server saw Joe's vote arrive at 11:01pm, but your server claimed it didn't arrive until 12:15am. Clearly you have a bug in your server's queue so I question every vote you tally or refuse to tally beginning at 11pm.\n\nI'll back up a bit and challenge a more fundamental assumption: > You'd still get improved count efficiency and consistent audit trails.\n\nCount efficiency. Who says that is a problem? The vote is in November the but politicians don't begin serving until January. That leaves plenty of time to count and recount and recount again, and yet again. The only times that the outcome has been in doubt is when there is some disagreement about what constitutes a proper vote or a proper voter. ie hanging chads or provisional ballots. There are still \"hanging chads\" with electronic voting where the touchscreen gets miscalibrated or the machine crashes, and provisional ballots are entirely unaffected by electronic systems.\n\nA judge isn't going to care that he can order up a spreadsheet that lists the winner and loser under a bunch of different potential rulings (ie we count the votes from Machine 23875 that failed in district 12, but not from machine 12123 in district 8 that was miscalibrated). In many ways the plausible existence of such a spreadsheet makes things worse for the judge. Its much easier to defend a ruling that says \"count the hanging chads as yes\" when you don't know for sure what the outcome will be.\n\nConsistent Audit Trails. What makes a bunch of computer records a substantially better audit trail than a big heavy stack of papers in boxes that have to be physically moved around and physically manipulated to introduce fraud. In what way do we currently fail to have a consistent audit trail?\n\nI'll take the contrarian position and argue that secrecy is bad for elections. It grants politicians a monopoly on corruption and denies it to Joe Public.\n\nThere seem to be two arguments for secrecy one is to prevent a \"Boss Tweed\" system. I don't see how that would be so much worse than what we currently have. We have a Boss Tweed system where big corporations make donations to politicians who use that money to run ads and convince people they will help them and then do nothing of the kind because they know what side their bread is buttered on.\n\nIf a big corporation could instead just buy the votes of the poor in mass, the result might still be the same but at least the poor are getting some benefit from their vote and the corruption will be a lot more obvious. I see that as a win.\n\nThe other \"secrecy is a requirement\" argument comes from authoritarian dictatorships, but those systems don't have a legitimate vote counting process to begin with. Secrecy allows those dictators to claim that the results are correct and prevents independent agencies from demonstrating that they are fradulent. The UN can say \"lots of boxes which we suspect were for the opposition were loaded into a truck and disappeared so we decertified the election\" but they can't say that they were in fact for the opposition.\n\nIf everyone voted publicly in those countries then the dictator might be forced to choose between stepping aside and recognizing the correct count, or mass slaughter on a regular basis of those who publicly try to subvert his authority.\n\n> I'm sure that the UVF and the Provos would both have loved to have a public roster of who voted which way in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.\n\nAnd would that have lead to a meaningful difference in the outcome or a substantially greater loss of life? It was already a violent period so would it make much of a difference if the violence was better targeted?\n\nI don't know that I've seen anyone address that question directly. Everyone assumes that privacy is a requirement, and that makes the process of creating a secure, reliable, and understandable electronic voting system essentially impossible.\n\nI'm not in favor of electronic voting in general because I don't think paper voting is that bad, but if on insists on exploring the idea you might as well explore a more substantive change in the way we vote and challenge all the assumptions to make sure you have the correct system requirements.\n\n> TechnI'd suggest you examine how Debian handles voting. I'm not extremely familiar with how it works, but AFAIK it provides (a) and (b), but fails (c) (you have to be part of the Debian's Web of Trust to have your signature accepted) and arguably simplicity (because they use Condorcet's method). I think the Project Secretary is the weak link, because someone has to decrypt the actual votes and count them, so there is a possible leak there. But it's OK because everybody trusts the Secretary :)\n\nHow does the current, paper-based, non-internet system hold up to these requirements?\n\n> But you need to have (a) a public record (everyone can see what they voted),\n\nNot possible, you do not get a copy of your ballot\n\n> (b) privacy (nobody can see what anyone else voted for),\n\nMore or less guaranteed that public members will not have access to your vote\n\n> (c) accessibility (nobody needs special ID or keys or anything).\n\nIn most countries that I have been in, you do need ID (in some countries like India you need a \"special\" ID).\n\nAlso, in most countries with paper ballots, ballots are numbered, and the counterfoil has your name on it. So although the person counting the votes does not know which is who, in principle (and during allegations of fraud) a court can match each person to a ballot.\n\n> And you need a simple enough system that people will trust you when you tell them that these points are satisfied.\n\nYes. We do not need a foolproof system, just one that is good enough.\n\nThere _will_ be election fraud. We can hope that most will be detected, and punished. That is all that a good system requires, I think.\n\nHaving a public record of the vote is extremely dangerous, since it means that you can prove to other people how you voted.\n\nLet's rephrase that. It means that other people can demand you prove to them how you voted, and punish you if you didn't vote the way they wanted you to.\n\nHavingThis sort of thing is why a lot of countries make it a criminal offence to take photographs inside the voting booth.\n\n> Having a public record of the vote is extremely dangerous, since it means that you can prove to other people how you voted.\n\nOn the other hand, having no public record means that the vote-counters can change your vote and you'd be none the wiser.\n\n> HavingI'd bet money there's some combination of asymmetric crypto and hash tricks that would let you:\n\n1. Vote as many times as you want, choosing which vote is the \"real\" one.\n2. Publicize the entire voting record so that it's possible for anyone to sum all real votes.\n3. Despite (2), nobody can tell which votes are real, even their own, nor can anyone tell how many times somebody voted.\n\nThen if the algorithm and voting record were both publicized, you'd be assured that your vote was correctly counted (because you trust the algorithm, not because you can read the record).\n\nWith only these three points, maybe the government could drop votes from the record selectively. (Drop vote, recount. Didn't help me? Put it back, drop the next one, recount...).\n\nBut this could be solved if you could also \"vote\" a signature of others votes. You'd encrypt this signature with some secret. Then, say, your local watchdog group could sign the votes of you and all of your friends. If your votes go missing or the signature goes missing, the watchdog will notice and publicize the secret needed to verify this. Otherwise, the watchdog does nothing and nobody even knows what was signed.\n\nYou could even be your own watchdog, though if a lone guy is saying \"my signature is bad, they're tampering!\" people would likely assume he just did the signature wrong and ignore him. But if the ACLU were to say this, that would be a big deal. And since nobody could match the signature to the watchdog until their secret was published (after the election), any tampering would therefore run a risk of being noticed.\n\nYes, there are indeed such crypto tricks. Unfortunately, they fall foul of another requirement of voting systems: that they must be understandable by the common voter. If only Ron Rivest and his fellow crypto deities can understand said system and be satisfied that it is secure, then the thing is useless, be it ever so wonderful.\n\nVery Complex systems. ie most people won't check, and it would be reasonably easy to predict those who might check.\n\nIn a country where 50% of the people don't vote and don't care because they recognize it doesn't make a difference who they vote for this means that:\na) You can fraudulently insert votes from individuals who didn't vote and expect them not to check and verify that there vote was not recorded.\nb) [Potentially] Change votes of some voters who match certain criteria (unemployed, not connected to a politically active group, low education) and reasonably expect that they will not attempt to verify their vote matches what they claim to have voted for.\nc) If anyone does step forward brush them aside as a crackpot.\n\nThere is also a strong incentive for a reverse attack on the system from the losing side.\na) If you know you will lose cast the wrong vote (ie vote for the winner or somehow spoil your vote).\nb) Complete the protocol for the correct vote to try and introduce an inconsistency in the tabulation.\nc) Complain that the election is rigged. Most people won't understand the arguments one way or the other and come down on the side of their party in believing that either the voter screwed up (if they favor the winner) or that the election is rigged (if they favor the loser).\n\nSecure electronic voting from a polling booth is theoretically a solved problem. The keywords to search upon are \"end to end verifiable voting\". Like all good crypto protocols, these at first appear to do the impossible. They do not depend on trusting the voting machines, the counting process the people or anything else in the middle. Thus they don't require open source to work. They do publish every vote so voters can verify their vote has been counted, but they do so in a way that preserves anonymity and prevents voters from selling their vote.\n\nAt lease one state in Australia (Victoria) is implementing it now - this was covered in a talk at LCA 2013. They are using the Pr\u00eat \u00e0 Voter scheme, which sadly they omitted to mention in their talk. Possibly not the best detail to omit at an LCA conference. Instead they talked about what is I guess their most pressing problem - creating an interface for a voter who is possibly blind, or deaf, or can't write - maybe because they have Parkinson's disease.\n\nOthers have said this, but I'll re-phrase it slightly: Any robust voting system must ensure voters can't reliably sell their vote.\n\nI don't know of any internet based voting system that can do this and preserve the other features we want in a voting system, like anonymity and verifiability, despite heavy research into the area spanning decades. Ergo I unlike you I very much doubt it can be made to work.\n\n> Any robust voting system must ensure voters can't reliably sell their vote.\n\nWhy not? What is so bad about that? I voted for a third party and got nothing for it. Seems better to sell the vote for the highest price and then use the proceeds either for my own benefit of the benefit of the party I support."}

{"text":"Although the technological advancements have made life easier for us, they've also pushed the privacy to the danger zone. While online, you are at a great risk of being hacked and your privacy is at stake. Today! We've come up with some good tips that will not only help you in reducing further hack attacks on your system, but will also reduce the vulnerability of your system. Here are Top 10 Tips To Avoid Hack Attacks.\n\n10. Have A Unique Password For Everything:\n\nIf you have accounts at more than one social networking websites or sites like MSN, then don't use the same password for every account. It is highly important for the people who are running online businesses especially, the bloggers. This is because if your password, which is the same for every account you hold, is hacked then you're going to lose everything in a flash; from your business to the whole confidential or private data.\n\n9. Keep 'Remember Me' Option, Unchecked:\n\nWhile logging in to sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Msn etc, make sure that the 'Remember Me' and 'Save Password' boxes are unchecked. This precaution should especially be taken when you are using a public computer such as an internet cafe's computer or a system at your college or university. The box, if remained checked, saves your login details and passwords to the system you are using. So another precaution is to delete cookies before leaving the system. This option is available in the browser as can be seen in the following screen shots.\n\n8. Don't Stick To The Same Password:\n\nOnce you set a password, just don't stick to it for a long time. Keep changing your password frequently. This provides your account and data with further security and leaves you at a lesser chance of being hacked.\n\n7. Never Fill In The Fake Login Screens:\n\nPhishing' is a very common and basic thing that hackers practice. Hackers create duplicates login screens and if you login to any such FAKE MSN, Facebook or any other screen, you are actually handing them over your email and password. Be certain that if you are already logged in to any place such as Facebook, Twitter, Digg, StumbleUpon etc, you will never be asked for logging in again. So if you see any such login windows, just ignore them; they are Hackers.\n\n6. Don't Spoon-feed The Hackers:\n\nYour password policy should be of high standard. Keeping your name as the password or having a password like '12345\u2032 is a very bad idea. It takes less than a minute for hackers to break such passwords and having all your data. Try using an alphanumeric password that contains various symbols as well. Having a password like '*T%^w1i$t3te@r&', is recommended and is quite safe.\n\n5. Use Firewall:\n\nIf you are using a genuine Windows, then it surely has a windows firewall. All you have to do is to turn it on and it'll work without your notice. It is a gate between your PC and the outer online world; it stops anything, that can be harmful, to enter your system.\n\n4. Avoid Opening Spam Emails:\n\nNever open any spam email, i.e. emails from the sources you don't trust and emails you don't need. Hackers usually post infected links in such emails and even opening such emails can provide them a gateway to enter your system.\n\n3. Visit Only The Trusted Websites:\n\nAny good quality and paid antivirus keeps your system secure, while you're online. It only allows access to the trusted websites by warning you, every time you try to visit an un-trusted domain. The hackers are mostly deployed with porn websites so avoiding access to such morally degraded websites can reduce your risk of being hacked to a reasonable extent.\n\n2. Use Macintosh OS:\n\nIf you are a Windows user and are fed up of being hacked repeatedly, then all you have to do is to switch to Macintosh OS immediately. Macintosh happens to be the only operating system that is safe from hack attacks. So using it provides you with a better security of data and, obviously, the system.\n\n1. Use Anti-Malware Programs:\n\nMalware is, basically, a virus that is deployed by the hackers themselves. It can't transfer data from your system like spywares do. It attacks the functionality of your system by halting the programs\/software applications and\/or making them malfunction. This directly affects the efficiency of the computer system.\n\nLast but not least, it is better to keep a laptop or a handy tablet with you all the time. Public computer are mostly infected with key-loggers and once you login, your password is gone for sure. So, better use your PC\/laptop\/tablet or wait for the time you get home.\n\nHey!

{"text":"Free NIST Software Tool Boosts Detection of Software Bugs\n\nResearchers at the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST) have released an updated version of a computer system testing\ntool that can cut software development costs by more efficiently finding flaws.\n\nCatching\nsoftware \"bugs\" is traditionally difficult and time-consuming. About 50 percent of software development\nbudgets go to testing, yet flaws in software still cost the U.S. economy $59.5 billion\nannually. In efforts to address this issue, NIST designed the Advanced\nCombinatorial Testing System (ACTS), a freely available software tool.\n\nFewer software flaws mean enhanced security for personal,\ngovernment and corporate systems. Hackers often take advantage of software flaws\nto introduce malware including viruses and botnets to disrupt or take control\nof computer systems. Once inside a computer, attackers can access personal\ninformation or valuable company data.\n\nThe NIST Combinatorial Testing for Software is based on\nresearch by NIST and others and\ngenerates a plan for testing combinations of two to six variables that can\ninteract and cause errors. While studying software crashes of medical\ndevice and Web browsers, researchers determined that between 70 and 95 percent\nof software failures are triggered by only two variables interacting, and\npractically 100 percent of software failures are triggered by no more than six.\nIn one project, NIST could test all six-way combinations with only 522 tests\ninstead of 17 billion, and find nearly 100 percent of the flaws.\n\nSince the first version was released in 2008, it has been\ndownloaded by 465 times by industry, academia, government and individuals.\n\nPresident Obama has declared March 4-10, 2012 as National Consumer Protection Week, building on a coordinated effort that encourages consumers nationwide to take full advantage of their consumer rights and make better-informed decisions.

Again?\" Responding to a question about NIST's role in supporting manufacturing, Gallagher pointed out that the agency's mission goes back more than 110 years. Then, and now, that mission has been to ensure that U.S. industries have the infrastructure of measurements, standards, and technology they need to be competitive in global markets, particularly manufacturing-based industries. That mission is even more important today, when so much manufacturing is tied to advanced technology, and our research and development\u2014our ability to innovate\u2014is deeply embedded in our manufacturing capability.\n\nIn 1940, the United States was officially not involved in\nthe burgeoning conflicts in Europe and Asia.

{"text":"References he made to a security incident involving the online driving test system at the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in particular were believed to have led to his termination. A state spokesman has not commented, citing privacy rules, except to confirm that Maley is no longer employed by the commonwealth. In this interview, Maley gives his side of the events that led to his dismissal.\n\nRobert Maley\n\nWhat exactly happened? They terminated me. I was specifically asked not to talk about anything in Pennsylvania without explicit permission and to have everything that I would say to be completely reviewed before I said it. So yeah, they told me that, and, yup, I was wrong ultimately doing that. As far as the official reason, that's why. It's not because of the PennDOT incident. It was because I did not have permission to speak. Not just at RSA, I wasn't permitted to speak anywhere. I was on vacation when I went there. I went out there on my own time.\n\nWhat prompted you to do that? Pennsylvania is facing a lot of significant challenges with the economy, as are a lot of other states, with budget cuts, training cuts. It just made things very difficult. I don't presume to be the know-all expert about anything, and I need to get myself around the type of experts that they have at these conferences so I can learn what's going on so I can take that information back and share it with the staff.\n\nI was the one that was responsible for information security at Pennsylvania, so being exposed to the caliber of the people that I find at these conferences and the education that I can get [was important].\n\nBut what prompted you to speak about Pennsylvania security matters at RSA knowing that you didn't have the required clearance? Two reasons. The first was to promote the success that the commonwealth of PA has made in the information assurance world, and the second was to share information with my peers -- information I hoped they would find valuable in furthering our common goal of protecting our assets.\n\nSo what happened at PennDOT? There's been a lot of speculation in the press about the PennDOT incident. First, it wasn't a hacking. It was an anomaly. Something happened. It was caught. It was identified. The incident was closed and the vulnerability was closed as well. I would have never spoken in public about any vulnerability that would have exposed the citizens of the commonwealth. That is something I have never done and never would do. I was using [the PennDOT incident] as an example of legacy applications that are still at risk. The whole purpose of using that as an example is that the people at RSA are the ones who are responsible for protecting their citizens, their company. It helps for people to know what is really going on, about how fast things are changing"}

{"text":"April Fool's Day is a traditional holiday for the Internet\u2013perhaps the one holiday that is celebrated more on the internet than anywhere else. The ease with which 'regular' websites can be changed out for prank versions, as well as the various subtle ways in which clever hacks can take place, combine to make a holiday that can be enjoyed by both the prankers and the prankees.\n\nAmongst many websites that offer April Fools Day fare, there are certain standouts that reliably serve clever and interesting pranks year after year. Google is well known for offering several absurd new products and services as pranks, mixed with one new service that is genuine\u2013for instance, GMail was originally offered as a prank.\n\nThinkgeek offers a front page full of somewhat dubious and zany offerings, though, like Google, they usually end up implementing at least one of them\u2013Canned Unicorn Meat and the iPad Arcade Cabinet, for instance.\n\nSlashdot has traditionally had any number of prank stories on their frontpage, along with dubious 'features' and assorted other amusements; just as traditional is the grumbling of the killjoys who decry, every year, the 'stupid' practice of engaging in various shenanigans once a year.\n\nWorth noting as an ancillary to the Internet's celebration is MIT's tradition of elaborate physical hacks\u2013modifying a rotunda to look like R2D2, for instance. This year's appears to be a visit from a certain Doctor.\n\nThe military also will occasionally allow a prank or two to be seen in the public domain; this year's announcement of new headgear for the Army appears to be just such an occasionESR's seminal work on the jargon and culture of the common hacker, The Jargon File, defines a significant chunk of hacker folklore. Quantum Bogodynamics (a play off of the existing field of quantum chromodynamics, which describes quark interactions) is a folk theory deriving from the inconsistent behavior of hardware and software in the presence of those not sufficiently inculcated into the mysteries of How Things Work. Usually these would be suits\u2013that is, upper management of dubious technical ability\u2013but often enough those who work on the front lines of the IT world will notice a significant bogon flux around certain users.\n\nThe bogon is a notional particle that is a charge carrier for entropy, essentially. Where there are significant bogon levels, machines break down in various ways\u2013they refuse to boot properly; software may throw various errors; printers will jam. There are enough anecdotal cases of a simple desk move solving problems with nearby hardware\u2013moving the user away from the machine's proximity stopped the machine from throwing fits\u2013that variations on this hypothesis are widely believed by significant numbers of technical personnel.\n\nThis may be part of the notional reason behind the aura of competence effect; technical personnel are heavy emitters of antibogons (c.f. 'cluons' in the original jargon) and as such can purge a recalcitrant system in short order by being nearby. This also explains why certain formerly technically competent personnel, when promoted to nontechnical managerial positions, lose the ability to perform these feats; being in meetings with various suits surpresses their antibogon production. By analogy with a breeder reactor, these meetings may cause a formerly clueful person to begin to emit bogons much like the other suits involved.\n\nBogon production may be related to emotional intensity, as well; the more upset or angered the bogon producer is at the situation, the more likely it is that some critical component will start to fail. This explains the prevalence of errors in product demonstrations.\n\nAs of yet, there has been no literature regarding bogon shielding, but a 6\u2032 air gap between the bogon producer and any component of the machine under diagnosis or treatment usually appears to do the trick. The effectiveness of sheet lead has not yet been evaluated.\n\nVarious occupations have bits and pieces of folklore associated with their work\u2013gremlins, from last week's FFF, were originally a tale told by pilots and aircraft mechanics before they were fuzzy creatures with a problem with midnight snacks. The computer world is no exception; various technical occupations have their own bits and pieces of folklore that are handed down over time and which fill the same kind of explicative niche for these people as the gremlins did for mechanics.\n\nThe Aura of Competence is an experience common to most support technicians who have worked in the field for any length of time. The support tech will show up to fix a problem that the customer has reported, and the simple act of showing up is \"enough\" to make things run smoothly again.\n\nNumerous \"explanations\" for this effect exist\u2013some of which involve notional particles called \"bogons\" which are charge-carriers for \"bogosity,\" the principle that makes things break down. The highly selective nature of this kind of entropy nearly always strikes certain select users, and always at times when they were \"not doing anything, [they] swear!\"\n\nPresumably, the technician acts much like the moderating medium in a nuclear reactor, then, and inhibits the bogon flux, thus allowing the machine to operate smoothly again.\n\nAnother variation is when a process (registering someone on a website, say, or printing a document) continually fails, and no amount of coaxing by the user will make the process successfully complete. Again, the technician shows up and either performs the \"exact same\" actions, or watches the user do so\u2013and the process succeeds. The user will generally protest that it had only \"just\" started working when the technician showed up.\n\nThis variant is rather like the koan of the LISP machine, in that the process will only work when someone of sufficient understanding is present.\n\nThis effect may be found in other sufficiently technical disciplines, whenever there is equipment whose functioning is beyond the ability of a layman to fully understand. Rationally, the users in all the above cases must not have observed some difference in the machine's setup or the procedure; however, users are not usually very rational and will seek to rationalize that the technician's presence must have had some kind of magic effect. Accordingly, it may be in the technician's professional best interests to play along; users tend to become more than a little resentful if they're informed that the problem is all in their head, and some of these users may write the technician's paycheck.\n\nGremlins first came to the notice of the public from stories of military\n\nWhile most of the modern understanding of Lycanthropy is more a product of Hollywood than of folklore per se, the stories of people who could turn into animals are fairly old in basis. The word itself derives from the Greek, and hearkens back to the days when the mythic cycles told of the Gods descending to the Earth and taking the form of animals for various purposes. Neither were these stories limited to the Greco-Roman mythic cycles; the Norse had their own versions, as did the Chinese, as did every other civilization\u2013the Tempter taking the form of a snake, according to traditional interpretations of the Genesis story, could be seen as another example of these.\n\nGenerally, the animal transformations could be grouped into voluntary and involuntary types; the involuntary ones\u2013the hollywood Werewolf, the transformation of Actaeon into a deer\u2013being the result of some sort of curse or divine disfavor and the voluntary ones typically the result of some form of magic.\n\nThe Hollywood version of the Werewolf, as a myth of modern society, presents some interesting implications. Various films have described the interactions with society that a typical werewolf would have to handle; in many cases, they are depicted as lonely figures that are required to keep apart from society and associate more with their animal brethren than with humans.\n\nIntegrating them into society would not necessarily be too difficult, though. While there would certainly need to be some regulation\u2013rabies vaccinations and licensing, for a start\u2013many of the 'savage' aspects of the lycanthropic transformation could be handled by a good trainer. The lycanthrope is generally depicted along the same lines as particularly vicious dogs are\u2013slavering, biting, etc.\u2013so the techniques used to establish proper canine behavior could well be put to good use, albeit with some slightly greater hazard to the trainer than the norm. Given that the lycanthrope may retain some human understanding, though, the training could well proceed faster than it otherwise would; they'll be more likely to understand the instructions being given than a regular dog would.\n\nAdd to this some therapy for the human side of the equation, in order to counteract the feelings of isolation that would otherwise result, and the situation begins to look even better. With proper canine conditioning and human understanding, the heretofore savage and uncontrollable lycanthrope could well become a valuable member of society.\n\nThere would be significant career opportunities available for a werewolf as well. Wildlife management of all types could benefit from someone able to see from the animal perspective and communicate from the human perspective. Wolf pack management in national parks would benefit\u2013who better to manage the pack than someone who is, at least sometimes, a wolf themselves? Urban areas could benefit, as well\u2013the city of Chicago has a number of coyotes that live inside city limits and act to keep the vermin population down; tracking them could be more easily accomplished by a lycanthrope.\n\nThen, the immunity to normal weaponry would also help; SWAT would very much benefit from lycanthropic members\u2013until criminals began to produce silver bullets, at any rate.\n\nThere's really no need for lycanthropes to hide from modern society any more than any other group, nor any call for modern society to discriminate agaisnt their condition. Their inconveniences can be overcome, and their unique talents used for the betterment and benefit of society and society's interactions with the natural worldAmongst the traditional beliefs of many European peoples is the concept of a domestic helper spirit\u2013one version is known as the Brownie. A Brownie, in exchange for a bit of bread and milk, will watch out for and help the family with which they are associated\u2013this includes cleaning and other similar tasks.\n\nUnfortunately, the use of faery labor in one's household could bring one into conflict with any number of labor laws. First, bread and milk would not count for sufficient wage; federal minimum wage rules place very strict limits on what proportion of a worker's pay can be designated by the employer for the purpose of providing meals and housing. Additionally, traditionally the Brownie has been said to, for instance, warn the family of fire and other hazards by waking them; this watchman function may qualify as overtime work, and demand further compensation.\n\nFurther, Brownies are very short, and may qualify for ADA modifications being required to accomodate them. And then there's the conflict potential for human workers\u2013exploiting faery labor for kitchen and domestic help would necessarily displace any number of maids and other domestics who currently make a living by cleaning houses and the like; if brownie labor became popular and reliable, then these workers would likely be forced to organize and to lobby for greater oversight in the market.\n\nAdditionally, there's the actions of the brownies themselves when they are displeased with their arrangements\u2013they are said to perform 'mischevious' acts (read: criminal mischeif) by breaking plates (vandalism) and driving unwanted people from the house (assault, etc.)\u2013activities which are outside the scope of typically acceptable employer\/employee relationships.\n\nBrownies, were they in today's society, would have great difficulties adjusting\u2013and the people who employ them, typically moreso.\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor breaks a story that's not been news for years\u2013that astrology has little to do with astronomy and a lot more to do with tradition.\n\nThe gist of the article is that, over time, a process called precession\u2013the same process that's responsible for the gradual drift of the pole away from the 'traditional' North Star and toward other regions of the sky\u2013has realigned the zodiac to a path other than the 'original' one. Even further, the 'original' one had little legitimacy, itself being a bit of fudging by the Babylonians who wanted a nice round, symbolic number for their zodiac, and which was passed down accordingly. The author publishes a table of dates and signs, including the 'neglected' 13th sign (Ophiuchus, aka 'The Chariot Driver) though no attempt at revision of traits for persons born during those dates is attempted.\n\nThe western tradition is not the only one that's attempted to chart people's personality and fortune by way of the alignment of the stars; there are traditions in China and India of similar sorts, and of somewhat greater complexity depending upon the specific tradition consulted.\n\nIt's interesting to note that most civilizations have had, at some point, a desire to correlate a person's life circumstances with the positions of the stars and planets at the time of their birth; this appearance of a correlation between birthdate (by whatever measure) and personality is still widely believed despite there being no correlation found in many studies. This seems to be a very early and long-standing form of confirmation bias; no doubt the 'traditional' aspect\u2013astrology in various forms has been verifiably practiced as far into antiquity as Babylon\u2013helps to convince people of its usefulness (for why else would people keep believing it if it didn't work?\u2013this being a funny sort of circular logic).\n\nThat's not to say that astrology has no use; in antiquity, knowing what 'sign' it was was really the only way of reliably keeping track of the calendar and of the planting seasons and the like; to those ancients who first figured out that the stars held repeatable timepieces that related in some way to earthly events, this must have seemed a miraculous and god-given thing\u2013so naturally ascribing other earthly events to the stars would only have made sense.\n\nUnto whose use the pregnant suns are poised,\nWith idiot moons and stars retracting stars?\nCreep thou between \u2014 thy coming's all unnoised.\nHeaven hath her high, as Earth her baser, wars.\nHeir to these tumults, this affright, that fray\n(By Adam's, fathers', own, sin bound alway);\nPeer up, draw out thy horoscope and say\nWhich planet mends thy threadbare fate, or mars. \u2014 Sir John Christie, by way of Rudyard Kipling"}

{"text":"Los Angeles - Hundreds of thousands of computers will simultaneously lose access to the internet on 9 July, unless their owners check for a virus that may have remained hidden for several years, the FBI has warned.\n\nThe so-called \"internet doomsday\" will come when the bureau turns off a server system its investigators installed in November, when they broke up an Estonian crime ring that was running a global internet advertising scam.\n\nSince 2007, the six men had been using a Trojan to seize control of computers from all over the world. Their malware was able to take over PCs and Apple products, though iPhones and iPads were not affected.\n\nThe virus, called DNS Changer, would redirected the web browsers of victims from sites they wanted to visit to ones controlled by the gang. Revenue from adverts tied to those sites earned the criminals an estimated $14m in commission.\n\nThe only noticeable effects of the virus were a slight slowing of internet service, an increase in pop-up adverts, and the anti-virus software having been disabled. By late last year, when the FBI and Estonian authorities shut down the racket, the virus had seized control of about half a million computers.\n\nHowever, had the investigators simply closed down the gang's servers, every computer infected would have been unable to access the internet.\n\n\"If we just pulled the plug on their criminal infrastructure, the victims of this were going to be without internet service,\" Tom Grasso, an FBI supervisory special agent, told Fox News.\n\nAs a result, the FBI created a safety net which would allow infected computers to remain online.\n\nIt replaced the gang's servers with a surrogate server system, and set up a free online \"DNS Checker Page\" which allows people to check if they are victims of the virus, and then remove it from their machine.\n\nThanks to both measures, the number of computers infected has fallen. But a little over 350,000 remain, according to FBI estimates. About 85,000 are in the US, and 20,000 are in the UK.

{"text":"Video: Cyber security students, class of 2012\n\nProfessor Luallen ups the ante with industrial cyber security students, challenges them to understand functionality of industrial devices and networks.\n\n07\/19\/2012\n\nShare\n\nFlash is required!\n\nA new class of cyber security students reflect on their forays into industrial networking applications.\n\nControl Engineering visited DePaul University College of Computing and Digital Media in Chicago again in June to meet a new class of industrial cyber security students. Professor Matt Luallen has been rethinking his strategy for the class, pushing his students to get a better handle on how a device like a PLC fits into an application rather than simply trying to figure out ways to break in.\n\nStudents in the class had a group project as well as an individual assignment, and had to present a report on each. There were four groups, each with four students, that had to create a system to perform one of the following functions: Control a model train, including moving the locomotive and operating turnouts; control a simulated gas pipeline, including running a compressor and maintaining system pressure; design a traffic signal system for an intersection; and control a miniature robotic arm. In all the cases, the students were simply given a PLC along with the necessary support equipment. The assignment asked them to figure out how to make the system perform a prescribed list of functions, including programming the PLC.\n\nThis might not sound like much, but these are students with no industrial background. Starting from scratch figuring out how the I\/O works and how to build a program is nothing to sneeze at. Once they got their respective systems working, they then had to figure out how to break them, or how a hacker might plot an attack. Some of the solutions the students create are better than others. For example, all of the projects required integration of a manual e-stop. The pipeline group included that function as part of the PLC program, which meant that if a hacker could break the program, the e-stop no longer worked. One of the topics of discussion was why that wasn't a good idea and how that kind of problem could be avoided.\n\nThe students speak for themselves in the video. You'll hear things that they learned in their individual and group projects. Keep in mind that these are resourceful IT students, not people with industrial experience. It's amazing what they can find out about the kind of equipment in your plant"}
{"text":"Priyanka's twitter update could be security threat\n\nNot just Priyanka Chopra, but any celebrity or public figure's Twitter updates can jeopardize national security, claims 24 year-old ethical hacker Ankit Fadia\n\nMumbai-based cyber security consultant Ankit Fadia, who claims that his website Hacking Truths was judged as the second best hacking site in the world by the FBI, says social networking sites are the latest threat to India's security. The potency and penetration of social networking in the country has made it possible for anyone to track and connect with film stars, politicians and other public figures who were once beyond reach. Karan Johar, Priyanka Chopra, Aishwarya Rai, Shashi Tharoor and Barack Obama are just a few from a whole bunch of celebrities who update their Twitter status regularly. But \"are they doing it wisely?\" is what Fadia asks.\n\nWhy are you apprehensive about celeb tweeting? If you follow celebs, you'll observe that they disclose information on where they are shooting, what their shooting schedule looks like and the hotel they are put up at. Unintentionally, they are inviting trouble, because troublemakers are hungry for such information.\n\nAny instances? Singer Britney Spears' account on Twitter is hacked almost once every two months. One of the hackers even claimed on her wall, that he's her public relation officer and that Britney is dead, with details about the date and venue of her funeral.\n\nIndian politico Shashi Tharoor's account has been hacked several times too. Even Big B and Aamir Khan's blog were hacked. Once a blog, website, social networking account is hacked, a hacker has full control over it. He can spread rumours, communicate with fellow criminals, and indirectly make you a partner in their crime.\n\nHow would you rate the technical stylishness of terrorists? They are far ahead. When I was asked by the US intelligence to decode some scripts after the 9\/11 attacks, I was stunned to see the kind of technology they used to communicate. The agencies had tracked some emails where a few individuals were frequently exchanging photographs of Canadian rockstar Avril Lavigne. Hidden text messages that aren't visible to the naked eye, were being exchanged through these pictures.\n\nWhat about Mumbai's 26\/11 terror attacks? For 26\/11, they had used highly secured Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) like Skype to communicate with each other. The data on VOIPs' servers is so huge that by the time you track them, the damage has been done and criminals are out of reach. The 26\/11 terrorists had used the \"proxy bouncing\" technique, where in they were sending messages through a Saudi Arabia based server, while they were actually sitting in Pakistan.\n\nWhy is tracking such messages so difficult? They know the loopholes, and how to use them affectively. Suppose three terrorists A, B and C want to communicate with each other, what they do is create a Twitter account and follow each other, thus forming a closed group. So if A posts a message saying \"Plant Bomb at Parliament at 11 am\", just B and C will be able to see the message. And since Twitter is based in the US, Indian authorities wouldn't have control over this exchange of messages.\n\nTracking messages is another problem. I will track a suspicious mail only if it's sent. If A wants to communicate with B, he will type an email and save it as a draft instead of sending it. Now B, whose has A's password will log in to A's account, read the mail in the \"Draft\" folder. Since the mail hasn't been sent, it becomes almost impossible to track it.\n\nHow do spammers and hackers operate in social networking sphere? There are viruses, worms, spyware and malware that spread through social networking websites. One day, you receive a private message from one of your friends (who is already infected) containing a link to a Youtube video. Halfway through the video, it will prompt you to download some video plugin. Since the message comes from your friend, you trust it, but the moment you click it, you get infected. Get rich quick schemes, earn money online scams and various money laundering attacks now come through social networking sites."}

{"text":"When does self-responsibility kick in?\n\nAccording to itnews, Websense has reported that 1,000 sites are using the smartbomb, which can be purchased for as little as US$10.00.\n\nThe worrying thing that caught my attention about the report is that according to the statistics from just one attacker site, over 1,770 PCs were successfully compromised via a vulnerability that was patched back in April 2003!!! I find it amazing that there are still computers out there that are vulnerable to an exploit that was patched three years ago.\n\nThe second most successful exploit for the highlighted attack site was one that targeted createTextRange, which was patched on April 11 - Websense reports that 1,507 PCs were compromised via that vulnerability.\n\nThere is only so much that we, as computer professionals, can do to protect people from themselves. Sooner or later every computer owner has to take responsibility for their own PCs, for their own security, and for their own education.\n\nWe're having an interesting discussion in a security focused mailing list at the moment about reports that Windows Vista's outbound firewall abilities will be disabled by default because the corporate end of town want it that way.\n\nSome of the reasons given for why the decision is ok are, to me at least, staggering - for example:\n\n1. The average user is not going to be interested or will freak out; 2. Stuff may get through anyway; 3. If you force them to learn they'll start using another OS; 4. The public doesn't want to be educated; 5. Computer manufacturers\/ISPs won't like the cost of supporting confused users.\n\nSo.... computer manufacturers\/ISPs won't like having to wear the cost of support calls - big deal. Let's think about cost. How much money do you think is spent fighting, for example, spam? Spam that comes from compromised home computers? How much money has been and continues to be spent by corporations and private citizens paying for the bandwidth absorbed by said spam? How many corporations have had to spend money on various attempts to ward off spam whether it be software or hardware solutions. How many have had to upgrade their hardware to cope with the demand? How much money do you think has been spent is fighting denial of service attacks from compromised home machines? How much money is spent fighting to take down phishing sites on compromised home machines? How much money has been lost to the criminals behind phishing sites? (the last report I read mentioned losses running into the millions).\n\nUsers who are not willing to educate themselves are a risk to themselves and other internet users. Their compromised machines pump out spam; their compromised machines are used for denial of service attacks; their compromised machines are used to host phishing websites.\n\nI am a finite resource; my associates are a finite resource; sooner or later we have to say \"listen, you're harming the community at large, get with it or get out'.\n\nTherefore, if forcing users to 'get educated' ends up with their choosing a different operating system, then I'll show them the way and shut the door behind them. Its one less thing to worry about. If forcing users to learn about and use things like firewalls and patching leads them to choose a different operating system - there's the door.\n\nIf home users are not educated - if they will not take responsibility for their own machines - then spam will not go away, denial of service attacks will not go away, phishing web sites will not go away. That's the reality folks.\n\nI have met Mike Danseglio (the guy who was interviewed for the article) - I attending training sessions that he held back in April 2005 in Singapore and still have his business card on my desk. I remember how we left his sessions thinking \"we're screwed\". I also remember that we wanted to cancel all the other sessions for the rest of the day so that we could continue working with and learning from Mike.\n\nWhen I look at the risk to the internet community at large from compromised machines spewing crap I wonder how the heck people can say that not pushing for user education is ok.\n\nComments\n\nThat was good, Sandi, as far as you went, but why is MS still in denial about the validity of outbound filtering? You and I have both seen forums full of people already using this to protect themselves successfully. You and I know that there are companies out there making big bucks marketing the technology. So why is MS still denying the validity?\n\nCould it possibly be because that capability gives the users a measure of control over the OS that they have never had before and that MS doesn't want them to have? I hope that isn't the reason because I don't like tinfoil and look silly in a hat made of that. Tell me that they are misguided instead.\n\nOk, I do not believe that MS has decided on a stateful firewall for any ulterior motive. That being said, I believe they are wrong to bow to the requirements of their corporate customers. Instead of simply turning it off they could offer custom installations that allow for disabling of various features, but which leaves filtering on by default.\n\nI am remembering many discussions, interviews and online articles read over the years since the Windows Firewall (then known as the Internet Connection Firewall) was first released which has left an overall impression that MS were not aiming to compete with products such as ZoneAlarm, Kerio and Sygate (all of which prompt the user to make a decision about allowing various programmes access btw) but rather wanted to give users protection from events like Blaster and Sasser - of course, the fact that the original firewall was TURNED OFF BY DEFAULT was a bit of a boo-boo, but they fixed that in XPSP2.\n\nMy understanding is that the whole point of the firewall was not to provide a comprehensive solution. I am remembering an awareness of the firewall products that were already out there and popular. My personal opinion is that if MS went head to head with established products they'd like find themselves in court.. again..\n\nNow, how MS' decision to provide basic protection from events like Sasser and Blaster, and not compete with established comprehensive products, transmuted into people believing that they are saying that outbound filtering is not necessary or ineffective, is not something I quite understand.\n\nThe primary reasons in the public space that I am seeing for the no-outbound-filtering opinion is that:\n\n1) users aren't going to understand the messsages or be able to decide what they can or cannot allow (svchost.exe wanting access to the internet is the number one example in such discussions); and\n\n2) if malware is on your machine it is no longer your machine anyway and you are at risk of the firewall being bypassed (the 'why bother because they might be able to get around it' argument).\n\nWRT users not understanding the prompts that may be presented about, for example, svchost.exe wanting to access the internet, I would love to see a company design a firewall alert that says <program> is **trying to use svchost.exe** to access the internet. If the alert window could include the associated icon, details of the target path and pertinent information such as company name and product name from the file's built-in version info, then all the better. If MS decided to introduce a more comprehensive product, that is the path I would like to see them take.\n\nThank you for saying so well what needs to be said. I hope you won't mind if I quote you here and there! ;-)\n\nIf \"they\" switch to other OS's, those will just end up spewing out spam and crap anyway without the generosity of Vlad Mazek and his companies."}

{"text":"mobile-malware\n\nA new security threat: Mobile Malware\n\nTechnology related attacks tend to follow what is popular and gravity toward the platforms and devices that the large group of people are using. While email was once the biggest target of cyber criminals a number of new technologies have emerged, and as a result so has the focus of cybercriminal seeking to spread virus and malware to unsuspecting computer users.\n\nConsidering recent trends, Canadian companies and internet users should expect that mobile devices and technology as well as social media will be the primary source of attacks in the coming years.\n\nMobile malware threats\n\nAs more and more companies make the transition to social media and, more specifically, mobile technology, they need to be aware of the major threats that exist; primarily mobile malware.\n\nMany within the internet industry expect mobile malware to become a serious threat as cyber criminals are developed malware specifically targeted at the mobile industry, especially Android devices, at an extremely high rate. Smartphones and other mobile devices are full of data that is tied to personal and business financial records, passwords and accounts that if cracked, could be a source of value for cybercriminals.\n\nThere are two main reasons for mobile malware attacks. They are profit from infection, where the malware industry attempts to profit from the infected devices, and cost of infection, where they are concerned with how easy it is to distribute the malware. The end result being that each one of these approaches will force users to dip into their wallet for protection or repair.\n\nThe real danger lies in the fact that so many professionals have integrated work related networks to their personal mobile devices. Therefore, malware can impact users both personally and professionally if they are targeted.\n\nTherefore companies need to take security measures and set specific guidelines related to the syncing of company resources to get a good handle on a security measure to protect them against a potential mobile malware threat.\n\nMobile features that are at risk\n\nMobile device users are at risk in a number of different ways and mobile malware attacks are commonly focusing on these avenues to attack your mobile device:\n\nThere are a number of things that mobile users and companies can do to protect the\n.mselves from a mobile malware attack. Here are some of the most common steps:\n\n* Be smart with WI-FI: Be careful with your WI-FI use. Try and avoid send and receiving important information or messages over unfamiliar networks. IF you do, you will be open to having information intercepted.\n* Back up your device: One thing that always seems to get pushed to the end of the \"to do\" list is backup. However, if you get infected with malware, there is a good chance you could lose your contracts, so backup on a regular basis to protect yourself.\n* Use mobile anti-virus protection: Yes, this does exist. Many carriers are now including it with their devices to help protect the devices just as a user would protect their computer from potential threats.\n* Don't save important files: One way to prevent cybercriminals from stealing important information is to not store it on your mobile device at all.\n\nThe truth is that these threats are not going to go away any time soon. Therefore, mobile device users and companies need to be proactive and protect themselves from treats before they become a victim.\n\nMobile malware will test Android and iPhone A closed application market is not the best way to guard against mobile security threats.

{"text":"Newsletter Sign-up\n\nAn antiquated term that once was buried in the dusty pages of old law dictionaries becomes relevant again.\n\nBy JOSEPH D. JEAN, counsel in Dickstein Shapiro's Insurance Coverage Practice; SCOTT GODES, counsel in the practice and co-head of the firm's Cyber Security Insurance Coverage Initiative; and RACHEL WRIGHTSON, an associate with the practice in the firm's New York office\n\nAs computer technology rapidly advances, legislatures often cannot enact laws quickly enough to respond to new cybersecurity risks. Enterprising lawyers, however, have turned to old legal doctrines for relief. The doctrine of \"trespass to chattels,\" for example, is an antiquated term that once was buried in the dusty pages of old law dictionaries. But lawyers who handle cybersecurity issues, including allegations of spam, viruses, worms, unauthorized access, and more, have revived the doctrine as a means of redress. For companies facing potential liabilities based on such allegations, the availability of insurance coverage is critical to navigate the nuances of the ever-changing landscape.\n\nWhat is \"trespass to chattels\"? It is an old legal doctrine that protects against harm to property other than a parcel of land or other \"real property.\" Generally, trespass to chattel punishes one who substantially interferes with the use of another's personal property, or chattel. Since the 1990s, lawyers and courts have recognized this antiquated doctrine in the context of cybersecurity, network, and computer-related claims. Courts that imported this doctrine into the digital world reason that computers, networks, and proprietary servers constitute property, the interference with which can support a trespass claim.\n\nThe doctrine of trespass to chattels gained wide recognition during the anti-spam wars in the 1990s, when companies such as America Online, CompuServe, and others used the doctrine to try to hold companies and individuals liable for damages arising out of alleged spamming activities. But the use of trespass to chattels expanded beyond alleged spammers; class actions were brought against one online services provider alleging that the company's activities and software consisted of a trespass to chattels because they harmed users' computers.\n\nMany states currently recognize the tort, and it has been used with increasing regularity in the cybersecurity area. Companies typically face such claims when claimants allege that companies installed spyware, advertisements, viruses, or other malware onto their computers. The doctrine also has been used to support phishing and spamming claims. Other cases have used the doctrine in support of damages resulting from \"screen scraping\" information from a Web site by means of a search robot. Enterprising plaintiff lawyers may also begin to use the tort to support even more creative class actions against companies. For example, Internet and online service providers might start to face such claims in relation to provision or alleged disruption of Internet access.\n\nCOVERAGE FOR TRESPASS CLAIMS\n\nAlthough designed to cover a wide range of risks that could befall a business, many standard form \"traditional\" insurance policies do not explicitly mention cybersecurity or claims arising out of online activity. But look closely, because coverage can still be available. For example, commercial general liability (CGL) insurance policies, the basic insurance policies bought by thousands of companies every year, provide, in standard form, two basic coverages relevant to this question: coverage for liability arising out of \"property damage\" and coverage for liability arising out of \"personal and advertising injury.\" Both coverages might apply to potential liability for a trespass to chattels claim.\n\nCritically, insurance companies write a \"duty to defend\" into their standard form CGL policies, thereby obligating insurance companies to defend the policyholder against class actions and other claims. The duty to defend extends even to claims that contain allegations that are groundless, false, or fraudulent, and so CGL policies provide extremely valuable protection, even to have meritless claims dismissed, as defense costs always are incurred.\n\nIs trespass to chattel \"property damage\"? The first coverage found in standard-form CGL policies is for damages due to \"property damage,\" with property damage often defined to include physical damage to tangible property or loss of use of tangible property. When a company is sued for allegedly committing a trespass to chattels in the cybersecurity realm, that potential liability may be construed as arising out of property damage under a CGL policy.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the question of whether damage to software and data could be considered physical damage to tangible property, or loss of use of tangible property, was hotly contested in courts around the United States. Some courts held that damage to software and data, as a cybersecurity-based trespass to chattels claim must allege, was physical damage to tangible property.\n\nBut other courts--perhaps unwilling to recognize that when an old tort doctrine was applied to today's facts, insurance should be interpreted to follow the potential liability--held that damage to and loss of use of customers' data and software were not covered under a CGL policy because there was no damage to \"tangible property.\" The latter seemed to ignore that a trespass to chattels claim requires physical damage to tangible property to succeed. Because CGL policies are designed to follow the liability against which they were sold to insure, courts should find that such claims meet the requirements of property damage under CGL policies.\n\nThe insurance industry has since taken steps to change policy language, and certain policy forms now incorporate language addressing whether data, software, and other electronic information are or are not \"tangible property.\"Insurers are likely to argue that such language would preclude coverage for a claim of trespass to chattels based on damage to software and data. Nonetheless, CGL policies may still treat data losses as within property damage.\n\nThe Insurance Services Office, which drafts standard-form CGL policies, created two \"Electronic Data Liability\" endorsements that incorporate language covering loss of electronic data, including loss resulting from an \"electronic incident,\" but they may not be available to policyholders who provide certain types of computer-related products or services. Thus, when facing a claim based upon online or electronic activity, policyholders should carefully review their policy language and applicable state law.\n\nWhat is more, because insurers' obligations to policyholders are generally determined by the facts alleged in a claim--and not merely the labels applied to them--if the facts of the underlying activity constitute a trespass to chattel, then an insurer's defense obligations can be triggered even if the lawsuit at issue does not seek damages specifically for a trespass to chattel claim.\n\nOf course, if a complaint alleges that there is damage to or loss of use of computer hardware, such as a hard drive, server, or other component, in addition to software and data, there should be no question that property damage is alleged for purposes of a CGL policy. If a complaint includes allegations that unquestionably consist of property damage, under many states' laws, the insurance company will be obligated to defend the entire claim, even if there are other claims that the insurance company argues are not covered.\n\nIs trespass to chattel \"personal and advertising injury\"? In addition to coverage for property damage, CGL policies also provide coverage for \"personal and advertising injury,\" which often is defined to include coverage for claims that allege invasion of privacy. Depending upon the facts alleged in a complaint, a company's CGL policy may provide coverage under this section.\n\nFor example, a complaint might assert an electronic encroachment onto private property such as a personal computer, network, or server by way of a virus, spyware, worm, spam, or other electronic interference. If the action allegedly viewed or stole personal data, that could be considered an invasion of privacy, in addition to an electronic trespass to chattels. Some courts have found that the invasion of privacy need not be divulged to a third party for purposes of obtaining coverage, thereby making personal and advertising injury coverage applicable to a trespass to chattels claim. Additionally, even if a complaint asserts only a trespass to chattel claim, the underlying facts might develop to constitute invasion of privacy, and such facts may require the insurance company to provide coverage, notwithstanding a denial of the duty to defend.\n\nLooking beyond \"traditional\" insurance policies, which were originally designed to cover all risks of a business (with a handful of exceptions), policyholders should be aware that insurers continue to introduce new, specialized products for cybersecurity risks. These new policies are typically marketed as including data compromise, cyber liability, network risk, and\/or computer data coverage.\n\nThe Insurance Services Office, which designs and seeks regulatory approval for many insurance policy forms and language, has a standard form called the \"Internet Liability and Network Protection Policy,\" and insurance companies may base their coverages on this basic insuring agreement, or they may provide their own company-worded policy form.\n\nCybersecurity and data breach policies--certain forms of which may be known as network risk, cyberliability, privacy and security, or media liability insurance--are relatively new to the market and are ever-evolving. An experienced broker may be able to advise what coverages are available. Just as significant, an attorney with experience counseling policyholders about insurance coverage may be able to advise on the potential strengths and weaknesses of various available policy terms, including whether proposed terms might cover allegations of trespass to chattels."}

Some common examples of cyber crime include identity theft, financial fraud, web site defacements and cyber bullying. At an organizational level, cyber crime may involve the hacking of customer databases and theft of intellectual property. Many users think they can protect themselves, their accounts, and their PCs with just anti-spyware and anti-virus software. Cyber criminals are becoming more sophisticated and they are targeting consumers as well as public and private organizations. Therefore, addiitonal layers of defense are needed.\n\nAn Example of Cyber Crime\n\nAn example of one type of cyber crime is an \"account takeover.\" This happens when cyber criminals compromise your computer and install malicious software, such as \"keyloggers\" which record the key strokes, passwords, and other private information. This in turn allows them access to programs using your log-in credentials. Once these criminals steal your password, they may be able to breach your online bank account. These criminals can be anywhere in the world and may be able to transfer your money almost immediately.\n\nWhat are the Effects of Cyber Crime?\n\nThe effects of a single, successful cyber attack can have far-reaching implications including financial losses, theft of intellectual property and loss of consumer confidence and trust. The overall monetary impact of cyber crime on society and government is estimated to be billions of dollars a year.\n\nWhat Should We Do?\n\nTraining and awareness are important first steps in mitigating these attacks. All citizens, consumers, and employees should be aware of cyber threats and the actions they can take to protect their own information, as well as the information within their organization.\n\nSo\u2026 What can you do to minimize the risk of becoming a cyber crime victim?\n\nThe Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's National Cyber Security Division invite you to join us for the next session in the National Webcast Initiative Series:\n\nWith the ever increasing cyber criminal activity, it is no longer enough to just detect Advanced Persistent Threats (APT).

It is a day when online retailers offer special deals and discounts to entice shoppers to visit their websites and purchase products from their online stores. More than 122 million people are expected to participate this year. The popularity of this day has also drawn scammers and cyber thieves who want to take advantage of unsuspecting shoppers.\n\nCyber criminals are looking to gain access to customers' personal information and computer information. Once this information is obtained, criminals can steal a persons' identity, make fraudulent purchases with their financial information, take control of a users' computer, and much more. The tips below can assist Cyber Monday participants in making smart decisions whenever making online purchases.\n\nPause before clicking on any links from websites that are not well known to the shopper. If you do see a deal you are interested in, go to that company's website through your Web browser, not from a hyperlink within an email.\n\nDo not download files. No deals will be found in a .zip or .exe attachment. Stores will not make customers download files with additional pricing information.\n\nConsider proactive deal-hunting. There are major aggregate sites that can help shoppers roundup and find deals from other trusted websites.\n\nWhen purchasing a product online, make sure to use a credit card and a site that uses SSL encryption. SSL encryption will be denoted by the URL starting with \"https\".\n\nBe aware, debit cards and electronic money transfer accounts (PayPal) do not offer the same level of consumer protection as credit cards.\n\nThe newest iPhone now has an added line for apps per page.

I remember when I used to buy Sudoku books to take on airplanes. Now, I have three different Sudoku apps on my smartphone instead. Less hassle, and less space in my carry-on bag too.\n\nApps are used to get the news, communicate with friends, check flight times, share photos, get recipes, listen to music, and of course play games. The top 10 grossing apps of all time include seven games. Fruit Ninja and Doodle Jump are of course included. Current average app price is still less than $2, so they are affordable and always at your fingertips. (Apple Store Stats 2012, Impiger Moble)\n\nFor me, the lure of the app is the ability to click and use it instantly. That is also the part that concerns me. It is instant gratification, and I don't even feel like I am spending money.\n\nIt is easy to see how someone may get into trouble with spending too much time and money on apps. But an even more dangerous risk than losing a little too much time or money on apps is losing our identity or other information if we don't use them safely. Apps are here to stay, so we need to educate ourselves on how to use them securely.\n\nLarry W., who attended WC4's Cyber 101 class on November 14, had this to say about his experience on AnnArbor.com:\n\nI took this class yesterday.

It becomes the juicy\/high-value target for the attacker. Single point of failures are not good. Attractive targets are not good.\n\nAny person with access to the CA key can undetectably fake passports. Direct attacks, virus, misplacing the key by accident (the UK government is good at this!) or bribery are just a few ways of getting the CA key.\n\nThe single CA would need to be trusted by all governments. This is not practical as this means that passports would no longer be a national matter.\n\nMultiple CA's would not work either. Any country could use its own CA to create a valid passport of any other country. Read this sentence again: Country A can create a passport data set of Country B and sign it with Country A's CA key. The terminal will validate and display the information as data from Country B.This option also multiplies the number of 'juicy' targets. It makes it also more likely for a CA key to leak.\n\nRevocation lists for certificates only work when a leak\/loss is detected. In most cases it will not be detected.\n\nSo what's the solution? We know that humans are good at Border Control. In the end they protected us well for the last 120 years. We also know that humans are good at pattern matching and image recognition. Humans also do an excellent job 'assessing' the person and not just the passport.

In which case, the computer alerts the security guard whose own eyes may have been momentarily diverted. Or shut.\n\nAn alarm can be raised, for instance, if the computer discerns a vehicle that has been standing still for too long (say, a van in the drop-off lane of an airport terminal) or a person who is loitering while everyone else is in motion. By the same token, it will spot the individual who is moving rapidly while everyone else is shuffling along. It can spot a package that has been left behind and identify which figure in the crowd abandoned it. Or pinpoint the individual who is moving the wrong way down a one-way corridor.\n\nBecause one person's \"abnormal situation\" is another person's \"hot dog vendor attracting a small crowd,\" the computers can be programmed to discern between times of the day and days of the week.\n\nSarah Palin's E-Mail\n\nPeople have been asking me to comment about Sarah Palin's Yahoo e-mail account being hacked. I've already written about the security problems with \"secret questions\" back in 2005:\n\nThe point of all these questions is the same: a backup password. If you forget your password, the secret question can verify your identity so you can choose another password or have the site e-mail your current password to you. It's a great idea from a customer service perspective -- a user is less likely to forget his first pet's name than some random password -- but terrible for security. The answer to the secret question is much easier to guess than a good password, and the information is much more public. (I'll bet the name of my family's first pet is in some database somewhere.) And even worse, everybody seems to use the same series of secret questions.\n\nThe result is the normal security protocol (passwords) falls back to a much less secure protocol (secret questions). And the security of the entire system suffers.\n\nThe Two Classes of Airport Contraband\n\nAirport security found a jar of pasta sauce in my luggage last month. It was a 6-ounce jar, above the limit; the official confiscated it, because allowing it on the airplane with me would have been too dangerous. And to demonstrate how dangerous he really thought that jar was, he blithely tossed it in a nearby bin of similar liquid bottles and sent me on my way.\n\nThere are two classes of contraband at airport security checkpoints: the class that will get you in trouble if you try to bring it on an airplane, and the class that will cheerily be taken away from you if you try to bring it on an airplane. This difference is important: Making security screeners confiscate anything from that second class is a waste of time. All it does is harm innocents; it doesn't stop terrorists at all.\n\nLet me explain. If you're caught at airport security with a bomb or a gun, the screeners aren't just going to take it away from you. They're going to call the police, and you're going to be stuck for a few hours answering a lot of awkward questions. You may be arrested, and you'll almost certainly miss your flight. At best, you're going to have a very unpleasant day.\n\nThis is why articles about how screeners don't catch every -- or even amajority -- of guns and bombs that go through the checkpoints don't bother me. The screeners don't have to be perfect; they just have to be good enough. No terrorist is going to base his plot on getting a gun through airport security if there's a decent chance of getting caught, because the consequences of getting caught are too great.\n\nContrast that with a terrorist plot that requires a 12-ounce bottle of liquid. There's no evidence that the London liquid bombers actually had a workable plot, but assume for the moment they did. If some copycat terrorists try to bring their liquid bomb through airport security and the screeners catch them -- like they caught me with my bottle of pasta sauce -- the terrorists can simply try again. They can try again and again. They can keep trying until they succeed. Because there are no consequences to trying and failing, the screeners have to be 100 percent effective. Even if they slip up one in a hundred times, the plot can succeed.\n\nThe same is true for knitting needles, pocketknives, scissors, corkscrews, cigarette lighters and whatever else the airport screeners are confiscating this week. If there's no consequence to getting caught with it, then confiscating it only hurts innocent people. At best, it mildly annoys the terrorists.\n\nTo fix this, airport security has to make a choice. If something is dangerous, treat it as dangerous and treat anyone who tries to bring it on as potentially dangerous. If it's not dangerous, then stop trying to keep it off airplanes. Trying to have it both ways just distracts the screeners from actually making us safer.\n\nIndia Using Brain Scans to Prove Guilt in Court\n\nThe technologies, generally regarded as promising but unproved, have yet to be widely accepted as evidence -- except in India, where in recent years judges have begun to admit brain scans. But it was only in June, in a murder case in Pune, in Maharashtra State, that a judge explicitly cited a scan as proof that the suspect's brain held \"experiential knowledge\" about the crime that only the killer could possess, sentencing her to life in prison.\n\n[...]\n\nThis latest Indian attempt at getting past criminals -- defenses begins with an electroencephalogram, or EEG, in which electrodes are placed on the head to measure electrical waves. The suspect sits in silence, eyes shut. An investigator reads aloud details of the crime -- as prosecutors see it -- and the resulting brain images are processed using software built in Bangalore.\n\nThe software tries to detect whether, when the crime's details are recited, the brain lights up in specific regions -- the areas that, according to the technology's inventors, show measurable changes when experiences are relived, their smells and sounds summoned back to consciousness. The inventors of the technology claim the system can distinguish between people's memories of events they witnessed and between deeds they committed.\n\nEDITED TO ADD (10\/13): An expert committee said it is unscientific, but their findings weren't accepted.\n\nFriday Squid Blogging: Dissecting a Giant Squid\n\nAmong other dissection highlights, Hochberg pulled out plastic-like pieces, which comprised what could be best described as a backbone, as well as a translucent brownish-yellow piece of the beak, which is made of fingernail-like material. The giant squid's anatomy features a mouth at the top of the head, which means the esophagus travels through the brain. \"So you have to get very small chunks of food,\" said Hochberg, \"or you'll blow your brains out.\" The sharp beaks, then, are used to chomp food into tiny pieces before sending it down the esophagus, through the brain, and into the gut.\n\nTSA Employees Bypassing Airport Screening\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) rolled out the new uniforms and new screening policy at airports nationwide on Sept. 11.\n\nThe new policy says screeners can arrive for work and walk behind security lines without any of their belongings examined or X-rayed.\n\n\"Lunch or a bomb, you can walk right through with it,\" said Mike Boyd, an aviation consultant in Evergreen. \"This is a major security issue.\"\n\nActually, it's not. Screeners have to go in and out of security all the time as they work. Yes, they can smuggle things in and out of the airport. But you have to remember that the airport screeners are trusted insiders for the system: there are a zillion ways they could break airport security.\n\nThe Pentagon's World of Warcraft Movie-Plot Threat\n\nIn a presentation that rivals any of my movie-plot threat contest entries, a Pentagon researcher is worried that terrorists might plot using World of Warcraft:\n\nIn a presentation late last week at the Director of National Intelligence Open Source Conference in Washington, Dr. Dwight Toavs, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National Defense University, gave a bit of a primer on virtual worlds to an audience largely ignorant about what happens in these online spaces. Then he launched into a scenario, to demonstrate how a meatspace plot might be hidden by in-game chatter.\n\nIn it, two World of Warcraft players discuss a raid on the \"White Keep\" inside the \"Stonetalon Mountains.\" The major objective is to set off a \"Dragon Fire spell\" inside, and make off with \"110 Gold and 234 Silver\" in treasure. \"No one will dance there for a hundred years after this spell is cast,\" one player, \"war_monger,\" crows.\n\nExcept, in this case, the White Keep is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \"Dragon Fire\" is an unconventional weapon. And \"110 Gold and 234 Silver\" tells the plotters how to align the game's map with one of Washington, D.C.\n\nI don't know why he thinks that the terrorists will use World of Warcraft and not some other online world. Or Facebook. Or Usenet. Or a chat room. Or e-mail. Or the telephone. I don't even know why the particular form of communication is in any way important.\n\nThe article ends with this nice paragraph:\n\nSteven Aftergood, the Federation of the American Scientists analyst who's been following the intelligence community for years, wonders how realistic these sorts of scenarios are, really. \"This concern is out there. But it has to be viewed in context. It's the job of intelligence agencies to anticipate threats and counter them. With that orientation, they're always going to give more weight to a particular scenario than an objective analysis would allow,\" he tells Danger Room. \"Could terrorists use Second Life? Sure, they can use anything. But is it a significant augmentation? That's not obvious. It's a scenario that an intelligence officer is duty-bound to consider. That's all.\"\n\nMy guess is still that some clever Pentagon researchers have figured out how to play World of Warcraft on the job, and they're not giving that perk up anytime soon.\n\nThe NSA Teams Up with the Chinese Government to Limit Internet AnonymityThis is being sold as a way to go after the bad guys, but it won't help. Here's Steve Bellovin on that issue:\n\nFirst, very few attacks these days use spoofed source addresses; the real IP address already tells you where the attack is coming from. Second, in case of a DDoS attack, there are too many sources; you can't do anything with the information. Third, the machine attacking you is almost certainly someone else's hacked machine and tracking them down (and getting them to clean it up) is itself time-consuming.\n\nTraceBack is most useful in monitoring the activities of large masses of people. But of course, that's why the Chinese and the NSA are so interested in this proposal in the first place.\n\nIt's hard to figure out what the endgame is; the U.N. doesn't have the authority to impose Internet standards on anyone. In any case, this idea is counter to the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\" In the U.S., it's counter to the First Amendment, which has long permitted anonymous speech. On the other hand, basic human and constitutional rights have been jettisoned left and right in the years after 9\/11; why should this be any different?\n\nBut when the Chinese government and the NSA get together to enhance their ability to spy on us all, you have to wonder what's gone wrong with the world.\n\nNSA Snooping on Cell Phone Calls\n\nA recent article in the London Review of Books revealed that a number of private companies now sell off-the-shelf data-mining solutions to government spies interested in analyzing mobile-phone calling records and real-time location information. These companies include ThorpeGlen, VASTech, Kommlabs, and Aqsacom--all of which sell \"passive probing\" data-mining services to governments around the world.\n\nThorpeGlen, a U.K.-based firm, offers intelligence analysts a graphical interface to the company's mobile-phone location and call-record data-mining software. Want to determine a suspect's \"community of interest\"? Easy. Want to learn if a single person is swapping SIM cards or throwing away phones (yet still hanging out in the same physical location)? No problem.\n\nIn a Web demo (PDF) (mirrored here) to potential customers back in May, ThorpeGlen's vice president of global sales showed off the company's tools by mining a dataset of a single week's worth of call data from 50 million users in Indonesia, which it has crunched in order to try and discover small anti-social groups that only call each other.\n\nGPS Spoofing\n\nJon used a desktop computer attached to a GPS satellite simulator to create a fake GPS signal. Portable GPS satellite simulators can fit in the trunk of a car, and are often used for testing. They are available as commercial off-the-shelf products. You can also rent them for less than $1K a week -- peanuts to anyone thinking of hijacking a cargo truck and selling stolen goods.\n\nIn his first experiments, Jon placed his desktop computer and GPS satellite simulator in the cab of his small truck, and powered them off an inverter. The VAT used a second truck as the victim cargo truck. \"With this setup,\" Jon said, \"we were able to spoof the GPS receiver from about 30 feet away. If our equipment could broadcast a stronger signal, or if we had purchased stronger signal amplifiers, we certainly could have spoofed over a greater distance.\"\n\nDuring later experiments, Jon and the VAT were able to easily achieve much greater GPS spoofing ranges. They spoofed GPS signals at ranges over three quarters of a mile. \"The farthest distance we achieved was 4586 feet, at Los Alamos,\" said Jon. \"When you radiate an RF signal, you ideally want line of sight, but in this case we were walking around buildings and near power lines. We really had a lot of obstruction in the way. It surprised us.\" An attacker could drive within a half mile of the victim truck, and still override the truck's GPS signals.\n\nFear of Terrorism Could Cause Psychosomatic Epidemic\n\nUK Ministry of Defense Loses Memory Stick with Military Secrets\n\nThe USB stick, outlining training for 70 soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment, was found on the floor of The Beach in Newquay in May.\n\nTimes, locations and travel and accommodation details for the troops were included in files on the device.\n\nIt's not the first time:\n\nMore than 120 USB memory sticks, some containing secret information, have been lost or stolen from the Ministry of Defence since 2004, it was reported earlier this year.\n\nSome 26 of those disappeared this year == including three which contained information classified as \"secret\", and 19 which were \"restricted\".\n\nI've written about this general problem before: we're storing ever more data in ever smaller devices.\n\nThe point is that it's now amazingly easy to lose an enormous amount of information. Twenty years ago, someone could break into my office and copy every customer file, every piece of correspondence, everything about my professional life. Today, all he has to do is steal my computer. Or my portable backup drive. Or my small stack of DVD backups. Furthermore, he could sneak into my office and copy all this data, and I'd never know it.\n\nChange Your Name and Avoid the TSA Watchlist\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security wrote a letter to Labb&eacuteNew Book: Schneier on Security\n\nI have a new book coming out: Schneier on Security.

Yet the beak is attached to squid flesh that itself is the texture of jello. How precisely does a gelatinous animal safely wield such a razor-sharp weapon? Why doesn't it just sort of, y'know, rip off? It's as if you tried to carve a roast with a knife that doesn't have a handle: It would cut into your fingers as much as the roast.\n\nThe Doghouse: Tornado Plus Encrypted USB Drive\n\nMy first discussion was with a sales guy. I asked about the encryption method. He didn't know. I asked about how the key was protected. Again, no idea. I began to suspect that this was not the person I needed to speak with, and I asked for a \"technical\" person. After a short wait, another sales guy got on the phone. He knew a little more. For example, the encryption method is to XOR the key with the data. Those of you in the security profession know my reaction to this news. For those of you still coming up to speed, XORing a key with data to encrypt sensitive information is bad. Very bad.\n\nEDITED TO ADD (9\/13): In the comment thread, there's a lot of talk about one-time pads. This is something I wrote on the topic in 2002:\n\nSo, let me summarize. One-time pads are useless for all but very specialized applications, primarily historical and non-computer. And almost any system that uses a one-time pad is insecure. It will claim to use a one-time pad, but actually use a two-time pad (oops). Or it will claim to use a one-time pad, but actually use a stream cipher. Or it will use a one-time pad, but won't deal with message re-synchronization and re-transmission attacks. Or it will ignore message authentication, and be susceptible to bit-flipping attacks and the like. Or it will fall prey to keystream reuse attacks. Etc., etc., etc.\n\nCost\/Benefit of Terrorism Security\n\nSandler and his colleagues conducted an analysis of the costs and benefits of five different approaches to combating terrorism. I must warn you that, because of the dearth of information, this study is even more reliant on assumptions than usual. Even so, in three cases the cost of the action so far exceeds the benefits that doubts about the reliability of the estimates recede.\n\nBecause the loss of life is so low, they measure the benefits of successful counter-terrorism measures in terms of loss of gross domestic product avoided. Trouble is, terrorism does little to disrupt economic growth, as even September 11 demonstrated.\n\nUsing the case of the US, Sandler estimates that simply continuing the present measures involves costs exceeding benefits by a factor of at least 10. Adopting additional defensive measures (such as stepping up security at valuable targets) would, at best, entail costs 3.5 times the benefits. Taking more pro-active measures (such as invading Afghanistan) would have costs at least eight times the benefits.\n\nAccording to Sandler, only greater international co-operation, or adopting more sensitive foreign policies to project a more positive image abroad, could produce benefits greater than their (minimal) costs.\n\nWhat's that? You don't care what it costs because no one can put a value on saving a human life? Heard of opportunity cost? Taxpayers' money we waste on excessive counter-terrorism measures is money we can't spend reducing the gap between white and indigenous health -- or, if that doesn't appeal, on buying Olympic medals.\n\nTurning off Fire Hydrants in the Name of Terrorism\n\nHe explains all the district's hydrants, including those in Alexander Ranch, have had their water turned off since just after 9\/11 -- something a trade association spokesman tells us is common practice for rural systems.\n\n\"These hydrants need to be cut off in a way to prevent vandalism or any kind of terrorist activity, including something in the water lines,\" Hodges said.\n\nBut Hodges says fire departments know, or should have known, the water valves can be turned back on with a tool.\n\nOne, fires are much more common than terrorism -- keeping fire hydrants on makes much more sense than turning them off. Two, what sort of terrorism is possible using working fire hydrants? Three, if the water valves can be \"turned back on with a tool,\" how does turning them off prevent fire-hydrant-related terrorism?\n\nMore and more, it seems as if public officials in this country have simply gone insane.\n\nDNA Matching and the Birthday Paradox\n\nIs it possible that the F.B.I. is right about the statistics it cites, and that there could be 122 nine-out-of-13 matches in Arizona's database?\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the answer turns out to be yes. Let's say that the chance of any two individuals matching at any one locus is 7.5 percent. In reality, the frequency of a match varies from locus to locus, but I think 7.5 percent is pretty reasonable. For instance, with a 7.5 percent chance of matching at each locus, the chance that any 2 random people would match at all 13 loci is about 1 in 400 trillion. If you choose exactly 9 loci for 2 random people, the chance that they will match all 9 is 1 in 13 billion. Those are the sorts of numbers the F.B.I. tosses around, I think.\n\nSo under these same assumptions, how many pairs would we expect to find matching on at least 9 of 13 loci in the Arizona database? Remarkably, about 100. If you start with 65,000 people and do a pairwise match of all of them, you are actually making over 2 billion separate comparisons (65,000 * 64,999\/2). And if you aren't just looking for a match on 9 specific loci, but rather on any 9 of 13 loci, then for each of those pairs of people there are over 700 different combinations that are being searched.\n\nSo all told, you end up doing about 1.4 trillion searches! If 1 in 13 billion searches yields a positive match as noted above, this leads to roughly 100 expected matches on 9 of 13 loci in a database the size of Arizona's. (The way I did the calculations, I am allowing for 2 individuals to match on different sets of loci; so to get 100 different pairs of people who match, I need a match rate of slightly higher than 7.5 percent per locus.)\n\nMythbusters Episode on RFID Security Nixed\n\nSeems that the idea waskilledbylawyers under pressure from the credit card industry. Or maybe not; the person who started this rumor has retracted his comments. Or maybe those same lawyers made him retract his comments.\n\nDon't they know that security by gag order never works, except temporarily?\n\nSecret Military Technology\n\nOn 60 Minutes, in an interview with Scott Pelley, reporter Bob Woodward claimed that the U.S. military has a new secret technique that's so revolutionary, it's on par with the tank and the airplane:\n\nWoodward: This is very sensitive and very top secret, but there are secret operational capabilities that have been developed by the military to locate, target, and kill leaders of al Qaeda in Iraq, insurgent leaders, renegade militia leaders, that is one of the true breakthroughs.\n\nPelley: What are we talking about here? Some kind of surveillance, some kind of targeted way of taking out just the people that you're looking for, the leadership of the enemy?\n\n[...]\n\nWoodward: It is the stuff of which military novels are written.\n\nPelley: Do you mean to say that this special capability is such an advance in military technique and technology that it reminds you of the advent of the tank and the airplane?\n\nI'm going to make a wager about what I think Woodward is talking about, and I'll be curious to see what Danger Room readers have to say. I believe he is talking about the much ballyhooed (in defense geek circles) \"Tagging, Tracking and Locating\" program; here's a briefing on it from Special Operations Command. These are newfangled technologies designed to track people from long distances, without the targeted people realizing they are being tracked. That can theoretically include thermal signatures, or some sort of \"taggant\" placed on a person. Think Will Smith in Enemy of the State. Well, not so many cameras, maybe.Gait Analysis from Satellite\n\nBy analysing the movements of human shadows in aerial and satellite footage, JPL engineer Adrian Stoica says it should be possible to identify people from the way they walk -- a technique called gait analysis, whose power lies in the fact that a person's walking style is very hard to disguise.\n\nVideo taken from above shows only people's heads and shoulders, which makes measuring the characteristic length and rhythm of a person's stride impossible. That's not true of shadows, though, Stoica told a security conference in Edinburgh, UK, last month. Shadows, he says, provide enough gait data to deduce a positive ID. To prove it, he has written software that recognises human movement in aerial and satellite video footage. It isolates moving shadows and uses data on the time of day and the camera angle to correct shadows if they are elongated or foreshortened. Regular gait analysis is then applied to identify people. In tests on footage shot from the sixth floor of a building, Stoica says his software was indeed able to extract useful gait data.\n\nThe article goes on to say that using satellite images would be harder, but that the basic idea is the same.\n\nOf course, this is less useful for finding individuals and more useful for tracking a population as it moves about its day. But some individuals will have more distinctive gaits than others, and will be easier to track. Soon we may all need to walk with rocks in our shoes.\n\nIdentity FarmingCall it \"identity farming.\" You invent a handful of infants. You apply for Social Security numbers for them. Eventually, you open bank accounts for them, file tax returns for them, register them to vote, and apply for credit cards in their name. And now, 25 years later, you have a handful of identities ready and waiting for some real people to step into them.\n\nThere are some complications, of course. Maybe you need people to sign their name as parents -- or, at least, mothers. Maybe you need to doctors to fill out birth certificates. Maybe you need to fill out paperwork certifying that you're home-schooling these children. You'll certainly want to exercise their financial identity: depositing money into their bank accounts and withdrawing it from ATMs, using their credit cards and paying the bills, and so on. And you'll need to establish some sort of addresses for them, even if it is just a mail drop.\n\nYou won't be able to get driver's licenses or photo IDs in their name. That isn't critical, though; in the U.S., more than 20 million adult citizens don't have photo IDs. But other than that, I can't think of any reason why identity farming wouldn't work.\n\nHere's the real question: Do you actually have to show up for any part of your life?\n\nAgain, I made this all up. I have no evidence that anyone is actually doing this. It's not something a criminal organization is likely to do; twenty-five years is too distant a payoff horizon. The same logic holds true for terrorist organizations; it's not worth it. It might have been worth it to the KGB -- although perhaps harder to justify after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 -- and might be an attractive option for existing intelligence adversaries like China.\n\nImmortals could also use this trick to self-perpetuate themselves, inventing their own children and gradually assuming their identity, then killing their parents off. They could even show up for their own driver's license photos, wearing a beard as the father and blue spiked hair as the son. I'm told this is a common idea in Highlander fan fiction.\n\nThe point isn't to create another movie plot threat, but to point out the central role that data has taken on in our lives. Previously, I've said that we all have a data shadow that follows us around, and that more and more institutions interact with our data shadows instead of with us. We only intersect with our data shadows once in a while -- when we apply for a driver's license or passport, for example -- and those interactions are authenticated by older, less-secure interactions. The rest of the world assumes that our photo IDs glue us to our data shadows, ignoring the rather flimsy connection between us and our plastic cards. (And, no, REAL-ID won't help.)\n\nIt seems to me that our data shadows are becoming increasingly distinct from us, almost with a life of their own. What's important now is our shadows; we're secondary. And as our society relies more and more on these shadows, we might even become unnecessary.\n\nBT, Phorm, and Me\n\nOver the past year I have gotten many requests, both public and private, to comment on the BT and Phorm incident.\n\nI was not involved with BT and Phorm, then or now. Everything I know about Phorm and BT's relationship with Phorm came from the same news articles you read. I have not gotten involved as an employee of BT. But anything I say is -- by definition -- said by a BT executive. That's not good.\n\nSo I'm sorry that I can't write about Phorm. But -- honestly -- lots of others have been giving their views on the issue.\n\nFriday Squid Blogging: Colossal Squid was a Lethargic Blob\n\n\"We are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre. As she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob, carrying many thousands of eggs,\" he says.\n\n\"Her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt. I can't imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed, and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine.\n\n\"It's likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs, living on dead fish, while her mate was off hunting.\"\n\nContest: Cory Doctorow's Cipher Wheel Rings\n\nCory Doctorow wanted a secret decoder wedding ring, and he asked me to help design it. I wanted something more than the standard secret decoder ring, so this is what I asked for: \"I want each wheel to be the alphabet, with each letter having either a dot above, a dot below, or no dot at all. The first wheel should have alternating above, none, below. The second wheel should be the repeating sequence of above, above, none, none, below, below. The third wheel should be the repeating sequence of above, above, above, none, none, none, below, below, below.\" (I know it sounds confusing, but here's a chart.)\n\nSo that's what he asked for, and that's what he got. And now it's time to create some cryptographic applications for the rings. Cory and I are holding an open contest for the cleverest application.\n\nI don't think we can invent any encryption algorithms that will survive computer analysis -- there's just not enough entropy in the system -- but we can come up with some clever pencil-and-paper ciphers that will serve them well if they're ever stuck back in time. And there are certainly other cryptographic uses for the rings.\n\nHere's a way to use the rings as a password mnemonic: First, choose a two-letter key. Align the three wheels according to the key. For example, if the key is \"EB\" for eBay, align the three wheels AEB. Take the common password \"PASSWORD\" and encrypt it. For each letter, find it on the top wheel. Count one letter to the left if there is a dot over the letter, and one letter to the right if there is a dot under it. Take that new letter and look at the letter below it (in the middle wheel). Count two letters to the left if there is a dot over it, and two letters to the right if there is a dot under it. Take that new letter (in the middle wheel), and look at the letter below it (in the lower wheel). Count three letters to the left if there is a dot over it, and three letters to the right if there is a dot under it. That's your encrypted letter. Do that with every letter to get your password.\n\n\"PASSWORD\" and the key \"EB\" becomes \"NXPPVVOF.\"\n\nIt's not very good; can anyone see why? (Ignore for now whether or not publishing this on a blog makes it no longer secure.)\n\nHow can I do that better? What else can we do with the rings? Can we incorporate other elements -- a deck of playing cards as in Solitaire, different-sized coins to make the system more secure?\n\nUsing Shredded Checks as Packaging Material\n\nPrivacy Policies: Perception vs. Reality\n\nNew paper: \"What Californians Understand About Privacy Online,\" by Chris Jay Hoofnagle and Jennifer King. From the abstract:\n\nA gulf exists between California consumers' understanding of online rules and common business practices. For instance, Californians who shop online believe that privacy policies prohibit third-party information sharing. A majority of Californians believes that privacy policies create the right to require a website to delete personal information upon request, a general right to sue for damages, a right to be informed of security breaches, a right to assistance if identity theft occurs, and a right to access and correct data.\n\nThese findings show that California consumers overvalue the mere fact that a website has a privacy policy, and assume that websites carrying the label have strong, default rules to protect personal data. In a way, consumers interpret \"privacy policy\" as a quality seal that denotes adherence to some set of standards. Website operators have little incentive to correct this misperception, thus limiting the ability of the market to produce outcomes consistent with consumers' expectations. Drawing upon earlier work, we conclude that because the term \"privacy policy\" has taken on a specific meaning in the minds of consumers, its use should be limited to contexts where businesses provide a set of protections that meet consumers' expectations.\n\nMovie-Plot Threats in the Guardian\n\nWe spend far more effort defending our countries against specific movie-plot threats, rather than the real, broad threats. In the US during the months after the 9\/11 attacks, we feared terrorists with scuba gear, terrorists with crop dusters and terrorists contaminating our milk supply. Both the UK and the US fear terrorists with small bottles of liquid. Our imaginations run wild with vivid specific threats. Before long, we're envisioning an entire movie plot, without Bruce Willis saving the day. And we're scared.\n\nIt's not just terrorism; it's any rare risk in the news. The big fear in Canada right now, following a particularly gruesome incident, is random decapitations on intercity buses. In the US, fears of school shootings are much greater than the actual risks. In the UK, it's child predators. And people all over the world mistakenly fear flying more than driving. But the very definition of news is something that hardly ever happens. If an incident is in the news, we shouldn't worry about it. It's when something is so common that its no longer news - car crashes, domestic violence - that we should worry. But that's not the way people think.\n\nPsychologically, this makes sense. We are a species of storytellers. We have good imaginations and we respond more emotionally to stories than to data. We also judge the probability of something by how easy it is to imagine, so stories that are in the news feel more probable - and ominous - than stories that are not. As a result, we overreact to the rare risks we hear stories about, and fear specific plots more than general threats.\n\nThe problem with building security around specific targets and tactics is that its only effective if we happen to guess the plot correctly. If we spend billions defending the Underground and terrorists bomb a school instead, we've wasted our money. If we focus on the World Cup and terrorists attack Wimbledon, we've wasted our money.\n\nIt's this fetish-like focus on tactics that results in the security follies at airports. We ban guns and knives, and terrorists use box-cutters. We take away box-cutters and corkscrews, so they put explosives in their shoes. We screen shoes, so they use liquids. We take away liquids, and they're going to do something else. Or they'll ignore airplanes entirely and attack a school, church, theatre, stadium, shopping mall, airport terminal outside the security area, or any of the other places where people pack together tightly.\n\nThese are stupid games, so let's stop playing. Some high-profile targets deserve special attention and some tactics are worse than others. Airplanes are particularly important targets because they are national symbols and because a small bomb can kill everyone aboard. Seats of government are also symbolic, and therefore attractive, targets. But targets and tactics are interchangeable.\n\nThe following three things are true about terrorism. One, the number of potential terrorist targets is infinite. Two, the odds of the terrorists going after any one target is zero. And three, the cost to the terrorist of switching targets is zero.\n\nWe need to defend against the broad threat of terrorism, not against specific movie plots. Security is most effective when it doesn't require us to guess. We need to focus resources on intelligence and investigation: identifying terrorists, cutting off their funding and stopping them regardless of what their plans are. We need to focus resources on emergency response: lessening the impact of a terrorist attack, regardless of what it is. And we need to face the geopolitical consequences of our foreign policy.\n\nIn 2006, UK police arrested the liquid bombers not through diligent airport security, but through intelligence and investigation. It didn't matter what the bombers' target was. It didn't matter what their tactic was. They would have been arrested regardless. That's smart security. Now we confiscate liquids at airports, just in case another group happens to attack the exact same target in exactly the same way. That's just illogical.\n\nDiaries Written in Code\n\nSucking Data off of Cell Phones\n\nThere is a new electronic capture device that has been developed primarily for law enforcement, surveillance, and intelligence operations that is also available to the public. It is called the Cellular Seizure Investigation Stick, or CSI Stick as a clever acronym. It is manufactured by a company called Paraben, and is a self-contained module about the size of a BIC lighter. It plugs directly into most Motorola and Samsung cell phones to capture all data that they contain. More phones will be added to the list, including many from Nokia, RIM, LG and others, in the next generation, to be released shortly.\n\nSoftware to Facilitate Retail Tax Fraud\n\nThanks to a software program called a zapper, even technologically illiterate restaurant and store owners can siphon cash from computer cash registers and cheat tax officials.\n\n[...]\n\nZappers alter the electronic sales records in a cash register. To satisfy tax collectors, the tally of food orders, for example, must match the register's final cash total. To hide the removal of cash from the till, a crooked business owner has to erase the record of food orders equal to the amount of cash taken; otherwise, the imbalance is obvious to any auditor.\n\n[...]\n\nThe more sophisticated zappers are easy to use, according to several experts. A dialogue box, which shows the day's tally, pops up on the register's screen.\n\nIn a second dialogue box, the thief chooses to take a dollar amount or percentage of the till. The program then calculates which orders to erase to get close to the amount of cash the person wants to remove. Then it suggests how much cash to take, and it erases the entries from the books and a corresponding amount in orders, so the register balances.\n\nSecurity ROI\n\nReturn on investment, or ROI, is a big deal in business. Any business venture needs to demonstrate a positive return on investment, and a good one at that, in order to be viable.\n\nIt's become a bigdeal in IT security, too. Many corporate customers are demanding ROI models to demonstrate that a particular security investment pays off. And in response, vendors are providing ROI models that demonstrate how their particular security solution provides the best return on investment.\n\nBefore I get into the details, there's one point I have to make. \"ROI\" as used in a security context is inaccurate. Security is not an investment that provides a return, like a new factory or a financial instrument. It's an expense that, hopefully, pays for itself in cost savings. Security is about loss prevention, not about earnings. The term just doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nBut as anyone who has lived through a company's vicious end-of-year budget-slashing exercises knows, when you're trying to make your numbers, cutting costs is the same as increasing revenues. So while security can't produce ROI, loss prevention most certainly affects a company's bottom line.\n\nAnd a company should implement only security countermeasures that affect its bottom line positively. It shouldn't spend more on a security problem than the problem is worth. Conversely, it shouldn't ignore problems that are costing it money when there are cheaper mitigation alternatives. A smart company needs to approach security as it would any other business decision: costs versus benefits.\n\nThe classic methodology is called annualized loss expectancy (ALE), and it's straightforward. Calculate the cost of a security incident in both tangibles like time and money, and intangibles like reputation and competitive advantage. Multiply that by the chance the incident will occur in a year. That tells you how much you should spend to mitigate the risk. So, for example, if your store has a 10 percent chance of getting robbed and the cost of being robbed is $10,000, then you should spend $1,000 a year on security. Spend more than that, and you're wasting money. Spend less than that, and you're also wasting money.\n\nOf course, that $1,000 has to reduce the chance of being robbed to zero in order to be cost-effective. If a security measure cuts the chance of robbery by 40 percent -- to 6 percent a year -- then you should spend no more than $400 on it. If another security measure reduces it by 80 percent, it's worth $800. And if two security measures both reduce the chance of being robbed by 50 percent and one costs $300 and the other $700, the first one is worth it and the second isn't.\n\nThe Data Imperative\n\nThe key to making this work is good data; the term of art is \"actuarial tail.\" If you're doing an ALE analysis of a security camera at a convenience store, you need to know the crime rate in the store's neighborhood and maybe have some idea of how much cameras improve the odds of convincing criminals to rob another store instead. You need to know how much a robbery costs: in merchandise, in time and annoyance, in lost sales due to spooked patrons, in employee morale. You need to know how much not having the cameras costs in terms of employee morale; maybe you're having trouble hiring salespeople to work the night shift. With all that data, you can figure out if the cost of the camera is cheaper than the loss of revenue if you close the store at night -- assuming that the closed store won't get robbed as well. And then you can decide whether to install one.\n\nCybersecurity is considerably harder, because there just isn't enough good data. There aren't good crime rates for cyberspace, and we have a lot less data about how individual security countermeasures -- or specific configurations of countermeasures -- mitigate those risks. We don't even have data on incident costs.\n\nOne problem is that the threat moves too quickly. The characteristics of the things we're trying to prevent change so quickly that we can't accumulate data fast enough. By the time we get some data, there's a new threat model for which we don't have enough data. So we can't create ALE models.\n\nBut there's another problem, and it's that the math quickly falls apart when it comes to rare and expensive events. Imagine you calculate the cost -- reputational costs, loss of customers, etc. -- of having your company's name in the newspaper after an embarrassing cybersecurity event to be $20 million. Also assume that the odds are 1 in 10,000 of that happening in any one year. ALE says you should spend no more than $2,000 mitigating that risk.\n\nSo far, so good. But maybe your CFO thinks an incident would cost only $10 million. You can't argue, since we're just estimating. But he just cut your security budget in half. A vendor trying to sell you a product finds a Web analysis claiming that the odds of this happening are actually 1 in 1,000. Accept this new number, and suddenly a product costing 10 times as much is still a good investment.\n\nIt gets worse when you deal with even more rare and expensive events. Imagine you're in charge of terrorism mitigation at a chlorine plant. What's the cost to your company, in money and reputation, of a large and very deadly explosion? $100 million? $1 billion? $10 billion? And the odds: 1 in a hundred thousand, 1 in a million, 1 in 10 million? Depending on how you answer those two questions -- and any answer is really just a guess -- you can justify spending anywhere from $10 to $100,000 annually to mitigate that risk.\n\nOr take another example: airport security. Assume that all the new airport security measures increase the waiting time at airports by -- and I'm making this up -- 30 minutes per passenger. There were 760 million passenger boardings in the United States in 2007. This means that the extra waiting time at airports has cost us a collective 43,000 years of extra waiting time. Assume a 70-year life expectancy, and the increased waiting time has \"killed\" 620 people per year -- 930 if you calculate the numbers based on 16 hours of awake time per day. So the question is: If we did away with increased airport security, would the result be more people dead from terrorism or fewer?\n\nCaveat Emptor\n\nThis kind of thing is why most ROI models you get from security vendors are nonsense. Of course their model demonstrates that their product or service makes financial sense: They've jiggered the numbers so that they do.\n\nThis doesn't mean that ALE is useless, but it does mean you should 1) mistrust any analyses that come from people with an agenda and 2) use any results as a general guideline only. So when you get an ROI model from your vendor, take its framework and plug in your own numbers. Don't even show the vendor your improvements; it won't consider any changes that make its product or service less cost-effective to be an \"improvement.\" And use those results as a general guide, along with risk management and compliance analyses, when you're deciding what security products and services to buy.\n\nMy LA Times Op Ed on Photo ID Checks at Airport\n\nNo-fly lists and photo IDs are supposed to help protect the flying public from terrorists. Except that they don't work.\n\nBy Bruce Schneier\n\nAugust 28, 2008\n\nThe TSA is tightening its photo ID rules at airport security. Previously, people with expired IDs or who claimed to have lost their IDs were subjected to secondary screening. Then the Transportation Security Administration realized that meant someone on the government's no-fly list -- the list that is supposed to keep our planes safe from terrorists -- could just fly with no ID.\n\nNow, people without ID must also answer personal questions from their credit history to ascertain their identity. The TSA will keep records of who those ID-less people are, too, in case they're trying to probe the system.\n\nThis may seem like an improvement, except that the photo ID requirement is a joke. Anyone on the no-fly list can easily fly whenever he wants. Even worse, the whole concept of matching passenger names against a list of bad guys has negligible security value.\n\nHow to fly, even if you are on the no-fly list: Buy a ticket in some innocent person's name. At home, before your flight, check in online and print out your boarding pass. Then, save that web page as a PDF and use Adobe Acrobat to change the name on the boarding pass to your own. Print it again. At the airport, use the fake boarding pass and your valid ID to get through security. At the gate, use the real boarding pass in the fake name to board your flight.\n\nThe problem is that it is unverified passenger names that get checked against the no-fly list. At security checkpoints, the TSA just matches IDs to whatever is printed on the boarding passes. The airline checks boarding passes against tickets when people board the plane. But because no one checks ticketed names against IDs, the security breaks down.\n\nThis vulnerability isn't new. It isn't even subtle. I wrote about it in 2003, and again in 2006. I asked Kip Hawley, who runs the TSA, about it in 2007. Today, any terrorist smart enough to Google \"print your own boarding pass\" can bypass the no-fly list.\n\nThis gaping security hole would bother me more if the very idea of a no-fly list weren't so ineffective. The system is based on the faulty notion that the feds have this master list of terrorists, and all we have to do is keep the people on the list off the planes.\n\nThat's just not true. The no-fly list -- a list of people so dangerous they are not allowed to fly yet so innocent we can't arrest them -- and the less dangerous \"watch list\" contain a combined 1 million names representing the identities and aliases of an estimated 400,000 people. There aren't that many terrorists out there; if there were, we would be feeling their effects.\n\nAlmost all of the people stopped by the no-fly list are false positives. It catches innocents such as Ted Kennedy, whose name is similar to someone's on the list, and Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens), who was on the list but no one knew why.\n\nThe no-fly list is a Kafkaesque nightmare for the thousands of innocent Americans who are harassed and detained every time they fly. Put on the list by unidentified government officials, they can't get off. They can't challenge the TSA about their status or prove their innocence. (The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decided this month that no-fly passengers can sue the FBI, but that strategy hasn't been tried yet.)\n\nBut even if these lists were complete and accurate, they wouldn't work. Timothy McVeigh, the Unabomber, the D.C. snipers, the London subway bombers and most of the 9\/11 terrorists weren't on any list before they committed their terrorist acts. And if a terrorist wants to know if he's on a list, the TSA has approved a convenient, $100 service that allows him to figure it out: the Clear program, which issues IDs to \"trusted travelers\" to speed them through security lines. Just apply for a Clear card; if you get one, you're not on the list.\n\nIn the end, the photo ID requirement is based on the myth that we can somehow correlate identity with intent. We can't. And instead of wasting money trying, we would be far safer as a nation if we invested in intelligence, investigation and emergency response -- security measures that aren't based on a guess about a terrorist target or tactic.\n\nThat's the TSA: Not doing the right things. Not even doing right the things it does."}

{"text":"Security\n\nResearchers Call Google Hackers 'Amateurs'\n\nA new report says the attack on the search giant's network was far less sophisticated than it has claimed.\n\nWhen Google declared in January that it had been the subject of a \"highly sophisticated and targeted attack\" on its network, cybersecurity researchers were quick to connect the incident to a wave of stealthy and innovative cyberspies striking companies around the world. But follow Google's hackers down their rabbit hole, as one group of cybersecurity researchers says it has done, and a portrait of those digital intruders emerges that conflicts with their \"superhacker\" image.\n\nAccording to a report that researchers at the cybersecurity firm Damballa plan to release Tuesday, the China-based \"Aurora\" hackers who targeted Google\n(\nGOOG -\nnews\n-\npeople\n) were both more varied in their tactics and far less advanced than early analyses depicted. The Atlanta-based firm links the attacks to a group of \"botnets\"--collections of computers compromised with hidden software--that used techniques it described as \"old school\" and \"amateur.\"\n\nArticle Controls\n\n\"A great play is being made about how sophisticated these attacks were,\" says Damballa's vice president of research Gunter Ollman. \"But tracing back the attacks shows that they were not sophisticated, and that the attackers behind them have a history of running multiple botnets with a variety of tools and techniques,\" many of which, he says, were far more rudimentary than Google or the cybersecurity industry has portrayed.\n\nDamballa says it traced the Aurora botnet to command and control computers in 22 countries, including China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Taiwan. By analyzing the structure and activities of the botnet based on information pulled from those command servers, it found that the botnet used a technique known as \"dynamic domain name system command and control,\" an older, more easily detected method of communication among hijacked computers that it says is rarely used by professional botnet operators today.\n\nOllman adds that the malicious software that infected Google's network, a Trojan known as Hydraq, contained code that was at least five years old and lacked the \"armor\" that typically obfuscates malicious software's purpose and prevents it from being removed.\n\nThose claims are already raising controversy in the cybersecurity community, which has taken the Google China hackings as a rallying cry against a new wave of skilled cyberspies that it has labeled the \"the advanced persistent threat.\" Beyond the Google incident, cyberspies have recently gained access to major oil companies, according to a report in the Christian Science Monitor. And they've also hacked more than 100 agencies, schools, think tanks and contractors, including Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics\n(\nGD -\nnews\n-\npeople\n), which do business with the Pentagon (See story, \"Dozens of Defense Contractors, Agencies Hacked.\")\n\nThe cybersecurity firm McAfee\n(\nMFE -\nnews\n-\npeople\n), for instance, which performed an initial analysis of the Google hack, wrote in an email to Forbes that it stands by its initial conclusion that Operation Aurora was \"one of the most impactful and sophisticated cyberattacks in history.\" McAfee adds that \"the goal of the attackers was not to create a botnet but to compromise key systems of interest to gain access to valuable resources.\"\n\nDamballa's report also threatens to undercut Google, given the search giant's claims about the hackers' high level of skill. The company's threat to stop censoring its Chinese search engine and even close its Beijing office in response to the incident also imply that the attacks were state-sponsored, but Damballa's researchers say this is unlikely based on the skill level of the intruders.\n\nResponding to the report, Google spokesperson Jay Nancarrow told Forbes he wouldn't comment on Google's ongoing investigation of the attacks, but that the company stands by its original statement. He added that Damballa has \"no firsthand knowledge of the investigation.\""}
{"text":"About\n\nFollowing\n\nHow you read matters as much as what you read. That's because nothing is written in a vacuum. Every news story or blog post has a perspective behind it, a perspective that shapes what you are told and how that information is conveyed. This is not, necessarily, a bad thing. Having a perspective doesn't mean being sensationalistic, or deceitful, or spreading propaganda. It can mean those things, but it doesn't have to. In fact, I'm fairly certain that it's impossible to tell any story without some kind of perspective. When you relate facts, even in your personal life, you make choices about what details you will emphasize, what emotions you'll convey, who you will speak to\u2014and all of those decisions are based on your personal perspective. How we tell a story depends on what we think is important.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes, perspective can be misleading. That's why it's important to be aware that perspective exists. If you look at what you're reading, you can see the decisions the author made, you can get an idea of what perspective they were trying to convey, and you will know whether that perspective is likely to distort the facts.\n\nEmily Willingham is a scientist who blogs about science for the general public. Over at Double X Science, she's come up with a handy, six-step guide for reading science news stories. These rules are a great tool for peeking behind the curtain, and learning to think about the perspective behind what you read. In the post, she explains why each of these rules is important, and then applies them to a recent news story about chemical exposure and autism.\n\nThe problem with this type of presentation is that you don't need cyberwarfare to do take down the electricity to New York City and get away with it. All you need is some household tools, imagination, and some knowledge of what the network looks like (gained by an effort at mapping the connections). Since 99.9999% of the recruits available to most violent groups don't have cyber skills and the impact of a cyber attack and a physical attack are the same, which method do you think will be used? The facts back this up. 99.99% of the intentional system disruption events that have occurred over the last decade have been caused through physical attack and not by cyber attack.\n\nSo, in other words, the tens billions we are going to spend on cybersecurity is mostly a waste of time\/money. It's not only a waste of money, it's yet another example of how the US national security system is not producing real, tangible security for the people it expects to pay for it. The real solution to network vulnerability? Decentralized production. The tech is available. If the billions spent on cyber were spent on growing local production by building resilient communities, it wouldn't only make us safer it would likely ignite an economic Renaissance."}

More than 277,000 computers worldwide may lose their Internet service on Monday (today!) due to some malicious international hackers who ran an online advertising scam over a year ago to take over computers.\n\nThe malware that infects these computers redirects data traveling to and from an affected PC, then routes traffic through rogue computer servers controlled by the hackers. The criminals are then able to steer victims to certain websites and steal personal and financial information. Seriously, I always wonder how these hackers pull off such diabolical schemes!\n\nThe scam initially threatened more than 570,000 machines, but the FBI got wind of the plan over a year ago. Agents realized that if they turned off the malicious servers being used to control the computers, all the victims would lose their Internet service. So your machine may still be infected \u2013 it's estimated that more than 64,000 of the computers that remain at risk are in the US.\n\nPeople with infected computers probably don't even know it, but they'll have a problem when the rogue servers are finally taken down in a few days. The temporary system will be shut down at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Monday, July 9, causing people with infected computers to lose their ability to go online.\n\nDon't worry, though: there is a way to tell if your computer is infected. You can visit the FBI-approved website  where you will find links to services that will run a quick check on your PC, as well as guidelines to manually carry out a deeper malware inspection. Keep in mind, malware is difficult to detect and often slows down the time it takes for websites to load.\n\nIt's also important to always have an updated, working antivirus protection program on your PC and to educate yourself about how to use the scanning and cleanup tools that come with these antivirus products. These programs aren't perfect, but they'll go a long way towards protecting your device.\n\nInternet service providers have plans to try to help keep victims online. If you do lose Internet service on Monday as a result, you will have to contact your Internet service provider for help reconnecting to the Internet. Don't forget to request guidance on how to delete the malware, or criminals will continue to control your machine!"}

{"text":"Today, we are more interconnected than ever before. Not only do we use the Internet to stay connected, informed and engaged, but also we rely on it for all of our day-to-day needs. We rely heavily on the Internet for everything from submitting taxes, to applying for student loans, to following traffic signals, to even powering our homes.\n\nAcknowledging the importance of cyber security, President Obama designated October as National Cyber Security Awareness Month to engage and educate public and private sector partners to raise awareness about cyber security and improve the resiliency of the nation in the event of a cyber incident.\n\nGovernment and corporate leaders overwhelmingly identify cyber security and associated trust issues as one of their top IT concerns. Use of network-based technologies such as mobility, collaboration and virtualization are increasing, as are related threats. Securing business infrastructure and data relies on solutions and secure systems from \"trusted\" vendors, a relationship founded on the reputation of the vendor, its people, its processes and its technology.\n\nCisco is dedicated to protecting organizations from threats including malicious modification or substitution of technology, misuse of intellectual property, supply chain disruption and counterfeit products. As the most trustworthy vendor in the world, Cisco delivers architectures built on secure software and hardware that is backed by a highly secure supply chain. By providing trustworthy and assured network platforms, Cisco enables government organizations and enterprises to confidently secure their business infrastructure, data and information from attacks.\n\nWe are currently in Cybersecurity month here in the United States, which is to say that our country is trying to raise our awareness in regard to our virtual protection.\n\nSo, Cyber Security? What is security for cyberspace\u2026? It's difficult at times to think of an imaginary border that protects networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. Unauthorized access\u2026 so hacking? Yes, but more devious with results that could even lead to injury or death of our population.\n\nImagine what would happen if, all of a sudden, one of our major cyber systems were \"hacked\"\u2026 What does that mean for us? Think. Just about our whole existence revolves around cyberspace. That's right, systems operate virtually to be able to manage simple things like pay roll all the way to complex things like flight plans, take-off and landing. Cyberspace is where your Facebook lives, Twitter, personal email accounts, and all of your personal finance information. Has your account ever been hacked by a friend posting a funny blurb on your account? Or has your identity been stolen by a hacker? With technology becoming an extension of ourselves, it's just important to protect ourselves. Let's not create an episode of J.J.

Here are a few tips all Internet users can do to practice cyber security during National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM) and throughout the year:\n\nAs government agencies, schools, hospitals and organizations everywhere transition to mobile workforces the need to rethink cyber defense strategies becomes critical. Rates of cybercrimes, like hackings, virus infiltrations and digital breaches, continue to rise and networks need protection in order to keep data\u2014and people\u2014safe. In fact, President Obama outlined the importance of cyber security in his Wall Street Journal op-ed this summer.\n\nIn addition, The National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) declared October National Cyber Security Awareness Month, so on October 25th , we invite you to join us as government experts, industry specialists and leading analysts gather for a cybersecurity town hall event, \"Defending Cyber Borders\u2014Beyond the Virtual Maginot Line.\" Take part in the discussion as guests like Forrester analyst Rich Holland and Sans Institute Fellow Rob Lee, discuss innovative cyber security strategies and technologies and teach you to build effective, cost-conscious approaches to protecting your networks.\n\nRegister today for the virtual event. If you can't make the date but are serious about cyber security, stay tuned for an on-demand version of the discussion.\n\nWe all know that the virtualization and cloud megatrend is a game changer for data centers, leading to profound shifts in everything from IT services and business models to architectures. Business benefits include reduced capital investments, new revenue growth opportunities, and the greater efficiency, agility and scalability demanded by globalization.\n\nEnterprises have held back from making the transition to virtual and cloud environments primarily because of the inherent security risks and concerns.\n\nTargeted attacks and security breaches are getting more sophisticated. The Verizon Security Threat Report for 2011 showed that 3.8 million records were stolen in 2010, and 94% of this data came from servers (an increase of 18%).\n\nAs security concerns are the primary barrier to making this transition from virtualized data center to cloud, we must rethink how security fits in to these new architectures and develop new security tools to ensure the secure transfer of information.\n\nFor enterprises to confidently seize the business benefits offered by data center virtualization and the cloud, security must be seen as the art of the possible, not as a hindrance.\n\nWatch below as I explore the challenges and leading practices for securing virtualized environments today, and into the future.\n\nSecurity events, such as vulnerabilities and threats, that are detected globally continue to grow and evolve in scale, impact, diversity, and complexity. Compounded with this is the other side of the coin, the unreported or undetected events waiting in the wings, hovering below the radar in a stealthy state. With all of the security technologies at our disposal, are they sufficient enough to provide effective protection? Well, it is certainly a good start when applied correctly. At a summary level, Cisco's Security Intelligence Operations (SIO) approach to this challenge was covered in the Network World feature article, \"Inside Cisco Security Intelligence Operations.\" However, one of the core human elements, which I will introduce, that deserves closer attention is the role of security analyst.

When the forensic investigator arrives, what does his workflow look like?\n\nThe most important first step is to do a careful analysis of the situation and use your common sense and experience to make an educated decision about the actions to take.\n\nEven in such an apparently simple scenario, there are multiple possible variations such as type of incident or crime, corporate environment, operating systems and hardware environment which will determine your course of action. It is important to gather as much information as possible about what happened before you start making any move. So the first step typically is to perform a quick interview of anyone who can provide that information and a review of the crime scene environment.\n\nAfter that, going down to the technical procedures, the first thing you will do is acquire the volatile evidence first, i.e. that evidence that may disappear or change quickly with your actions such as the information stored in memory, the network connections, running processes, etc. This may or not be easy (or at all possible) depending on the degree of access to the computer. Fortunately for us, the latest advances in forensic research have provided useful techniques that have opened new possibilities for the investigator, such as acquisition of memory through the Firewire port, acquisition of \"cold\" memory (Cold Boot Attack), advanced analysis of the memory and others.\n\nThen you would do an acquisition of physical storage such as hard drives, USB drives, memory cards and removable disks.

For example, crops in planting corn take at least 10 hours to mature.\n\nBut changing the clock time on a phone or tablet fools the game into instantly ripening crops. Some of the affected games attempt to detect such shenanigans but by changing the time by small increments or disconnecting devices CyFi managed to circumvent these counter-measures.\n\nCyFi has informed affected vendors of her findings but is withholding most of their names, giving them time to develop a fix.\n\nThe 10-year-old presented her findings last weekend in Las Vegas at the very first DefCon Kids, the new pint-sized campaign conference to DefCon. \u00ae\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nRE: RE: Yes, it is.\n\nYeah, it kinda is.\n\n1) The game is not working as intended. It was intended to, after a set amount of real time, set the crops to be at the next level of growth. They didn't have access to real time, so they used system time, which will be close enough. When you change the system time you are changing how it is intended to function. If they wanted you to be able to fast forward time, they probably would have given you a fast forward button.\n\n2) Cars are not built with hard-coded rules that would deny them from going 71mph, in almost all cases. However, if they were, but you found out that it only prevented you from going above 70 in the top gear (which makes sense, nobody could possibly go above 70 in a lower gear!), but you then realized you could drop it down a gear, rev the engine (much too hard, admittedly, for a low gear) for a second, and then pop it back into the top gear and be clear of the prevention scheme... now that's hacking! Breaking a rule outside the system by hitting a button or stepping on a peddle isn't hacking, but finding a way to bypass a lock that prevents you from hitting the button or stepping on the peddle could be.\n\n3) Your penis wasn't designed to be unable to receive blowjobs (I'd hope, but you had better clean off anyways just in case).\n\n4) Because the system has to trust input from the system time, and there's no technical way to avoid this, any hack involving changing the system time isn't really a hack? No! That just means that the system time is an easy attack vector that is hard to defend against!\n\n5) While it might not be clever for you to change the system time, a child who is but 10 coming up with it is rather clever for her or his age.\n\nWhy should we be admonishing this child as not \"really hacking\" the system. Encourage it is a great starting point and a simple example of game-breaking, hacking, and lateral thinking, so that we can continue to encourage this child to develop these skills into the future, so that when they are 20 they are able to understand the hundreds of different ways to protect, penetrate, or game a computer system to get a desired effect outside of the standard procedural bounds.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nYes, setting the clock forward to gain an advantage in online gaming is a (simple) hack. If you can make the program behave in an unintended way, you are hacking it. It is hacking as is setting the clock backward to fool \"trial\" software into a \"forever trial\" status, for example.

The system relies on third parties to issue so-called certificates that prove that a Web site is legitimate when making an \" connection.\n\nThe problem, however, is that the list of certificate issuers has ballooned over the years to approximately 650 organizations, which may not always follow the strictest security procedures. And each one has a copy of the Web's master keys.\n\n\"There is this problem that exists today where there are a very large number of certificate authorities that are trusted by everyone and everything,\" says Peter Eckersley, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who has compiled a list of them.\n\nThis has resulted in a bizarre situation in which companies like Etisalat, a wireless carrier in the United Arab Emirates that implanted spyware on customers' BlackBerry devices, possess the master keys that can be used to impersonate any Web site on the Internet, even the U.S. Treasury, BankofAmerica.com, and Google.com.

At the time, the focus was on securing the connections, not on securing the certificate authorities themselves--or limiting their numbers.\n\n\"It was the '90s,\" says security researcher Dan Kaminsky, who discovered a serious Domain Name System flaw in 2008. \"We didn't realize how this system would grow.\" Today, there are now about 1,500 master keys, or signing certificates, trusted by Internet Explorer and\nFirefox.\n\nThe vulnerability of today's authentication infrastructure came to light after Comodo, a Jersey City, N.J.-based firm that issues SSL certificates, alerted Web browser makers that an unnamed European partner had its systems compromised. The attack originated from an Iranian Internet Protocol address, according to Comodo Chief Executive Melih Abdulhayoglu, who told CNET that the skill and sophistication suggested a government was behind the intrusion.\n\nSpoofing those Web sites would allow the Iranian government to use what's known as a man-in-the-middle attack to impersonate the legitimate sites and grab passwords, read e-mail messages, and monitor any other activities its citizens performed, even if Web browsers show that the connections were securely protected with SSL encryption.\n\nIf Comodo is correct about the attack originating from Iran, it wouldn't be the first government in the region to have taken similar steps. Late last year, the Tunisian government undertook an ambitious scheme to steal an entire country's worth of Gmail, Yahoo, and Facebook passwords. It used malicious JavaScript code to siphon off unencrypted log-in credentials, which allowed government agents to infiltrate or delete protest-related discussions.\n\nComodo's revelation throws into sharp relief the list of flaws inherent in the current system. There is no automated process to revoke fraudulent certificates. There is no public list of certificates that companies like Comodo have issued, or even which of its resellers or partners have been given a duplicate set of the master keys. There are no mechanisms to prevent fraudulent certificates for Yahoo Mail or Gmail from being issued by compromised companies, or repressive regimes bent on surveillance; Tunisia even has its own certificate-issuing government agency.\n\n\"These organizations act as cornerstones of security and trust on the Internet, but it seems like they're not doing basic due diligence that other organizations are expect to do, like the banks,\" says Mike Zusman, managing consultant at Web app security firm Intrepidus Group. \"I'm not sure what we need to do but I think it's time we start addressing the issue of trust and issues of certificate authorities potentially not living up to standards that they should be.\"\n\nOver the last few years, a handful of papers and demonstrations at hacker conferences have focused more attention on the topic. But the Comodo intrusion, which appears to be the first public evidence of an actual attack on the way the Web handles authentication, could be a catalyst for rethinking the way to handle security.\n\nTwo years ago, for instance, Zusman was able to get a certificate from Thawte, a VeriSign subsidiary, for \"login.live.com\" just based on an e-mail address he created on the Hotmail domain. Even though it was revoked, it still worked in a Web browser during a demonstration at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas. Comodo, too, has previously been shown to have lax security standards among its resellers as far back as December 2008.\n\n\"Remember, the only reason Iran has to go to the lengths they've gone to to get certificates is because they don't have a (certificate issuer) of their own... most countries can just generate their own,\" says Moxie Marlinspike, chief technology officer of mobile app developer Whisper Systems, who has discovered serious problems with Web authentication before. One problem, he says, is that companies that issue certificates have a strong economic incentive to make it as easy as possible to obtain them.\n\nAnother worrisome aspect is that browser makers don't always have a good way to revoke fraudulent certificates. A discussion thread at Mozilla.org, makers of the Firefox browser, shows that after being alerted by Comodo, they had no process to revoke the faux certificates. Mozilla developers ended up having to write new code and test a patch, which took a few days and, even after its release, meant that only users who downloaded new versions of Firefox benefit.\n\nGoogle's Chrome, on the other hand, uses a transparent update system for desktop versions but not necessarily mobile ones. Microsoft said yesterday that \"an update is available for all supported versions of Windows to help address this issue.\"\n\nRoss Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge's computer laboratory, offered an anecdote in this paper (PDF): \"I asked a panelist from the Mozilla Foundation why, when I updated Firefox the previous day, it had put back a certificate I'd previously deleted, from an organisation associated with the Turkish military and intelligence services. The Firefox spokesman said that I couldn't remove certificates--I had to leave them in but edit them to remove their capabilities - while an outraged Turkish delegate claimed that the body in question was merely a 'research organisation.'\"\n\nJacob Appelbaum, a Tor Project developer who is a subject of a legal spat with the Justice Department over his work with WikiLeaks, says Mozilla should have warned of the vulnerability immediately and shipped Firefox 4 with a way to detect and revoke bad certificates turned on by default. (The technique is called Online Certificate Status Protocol, or OSCP).\n\n\"Mozilla's not taking their responsibility to the Internet seriously,\" said Appelbaum, who wrote an independent analysis of the situation. \"A Web browser isn't a toy. It's being used as a tool to overthrow governments...At the end of the day, they did not put their users first.\"\n\nSome long-term technical fixes have been proposed, with names like DANE, HASTLS, CAA (Comodo's Philip Hallam-Baker is a co-author), and Monkeysphere. The technology known as Domain Name System Security Extensions, or DNSSEC, can help. The Electronic Frontier Foundation's Eckersley, who runs the groups SSL Observatory that tracks SSL certificates, hints that he'll soon offer another proposal about how to reinforce the Web's cryptographic architecture.\n\n\"We do in fact need a way not to trust everyone,\" Eckersley says. \"We have 1,500 master certificates for the Web running around. That's 1,500 places that could be hacked and all of a sudden you have to scramble to dream up a solution"}

{"text":"Bandits in the BrowsersMon, 2004-04-12\n\nReprinted from The Triangle Technical Journal\n\nJust when you think that Web surfing is safe, think again. According to a report from the Computer Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), browser-based security attacks are on the rise and are anticipated to be \"the next significant security threat to IT operations.\" A browser-based security attack is defined as malicious code contained within a Web page (or HTML email) that appears harmless. The attacker uses the browser and user systems to sabotage or disrupt computer functionality.\n\nTo quantify the impact of such havoc on today's technology, consider the following:\n\nThe number of reported viruses or worms attacking Windows systems was nearly 4500 during the first half of 2004 \u2013 a 450 percent increase over the same period in 2003. Though worms rarely attack via Web browsers, viruses are often borne via email and attack weaknesses in the Web page rendering systems used by HTML email clients and browsers alike.\n\nOver 70 percent of all email in July 2004 was spam \u2013 and 60 percent of all spam sent originates from computers infected with worms or viruses.\n\nNearly 2,000 new phishing scams were reported in July 2004.\n\nPhishing is the act of sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft. The email directs the user to visit a bogus but very legitimate looking Web site where they are asked to update personal information, such as passwords and credit card, social security, and bank account numbers \u2013 information that the legitimate business already has. Bugs in the browser or email client make it possible for the \"phisher\" to hide their true URL from the end user.\n\nInstallations of spyware and adware are exploding \u2013 over 14 million instances were reported in March 2004, up from less than 2 million in August 2003.\n\nSpyware is any software that covertly gathers user information through the user's Internet connection without his knowledge. Spyware has the ability to monitor keystrokes, scan files on the hard drive, snoop other applications, install other spyware programs, read cookies, change the default home page on the Web browser, and gather information about passwords, credit card information, and email addresses \u2013 all the while consistently relaying this information back to the spyware author.\n\nAdware is a form of spyware that collects information about the user in order to display advertisements in the Web browser based on the information it collects from the user's browsing patterns.\n\nAs you can see, the Internet is not as friendly as it once was thought to be. Today, it is populated with criminals who have moved from the simple deviltry of erasing hard drives to that of the criminal activity of identity theft. And they're not acting alone \u2013 finding that banding together to leverage each other skills is proving more profitable. Recently through an ordinary Google search, the Secret Service found and subsequently shut down ShadowCrew, an online shopping bazaar where criminals would buy and sell credit card numbers and identity documents. In total, there were approximately 4,000 criminals participating on the ShadowCrew site with predictions of estimated thefts valuing $1 billion if the site had not been shut down.\n\nSo how do you fight back? First, you need to clean up your computer, then you need to maintain that protection.\nTo clean up your computer, perform the following:\n\nUse an anti-virus software application to scan your computer for viruses, worms, and trojans. Scanning your computer can take from 15 minutes to an hour, depending on your system. Keep your antivirus software current! New variants are discovered \"in the wild\" at the rate of several a day, and all it takes is for one of them to defeat your outdated antivirus patterns.\n\nIn dealing with adware and spyware, the first step is to perform an online scan to detect any resident adware or spyware. A scan can be done through  Once detected, adware and spyware can be removed through any of the following programs: Ad-Aware, Microsoft's AntiSpyware, and Spybot Search and Destroy. Once you have installed a program, plan to get updates and run it regularly. To minimize attacks of adware and spyware, it is also a good idea to block pop-up windows.\n\nDownload and apply all browser and Windows patches. If you're using IE, you can download Microsoft patches by going to Tools-Windows Update in your browser window. Check for browser patches regularly, and check for system security updates at least once a week. It is an important security practice to use an up-to-date browser, install all the latest browser patches, and keep your computer's operating system patched and up-to-date.\n\nConsider installing and using a different browser. Because IE accounts for more than 95 percent of the browser market, and because it is sadly very insecure, most cyberbandits target it more heavily than other browsers. An alternative available to IE that is worth investigating is the Mozilla Foundation's Firefox.\n\nIf it is not possible to switch from IE, then you should set its security level to High. Since setting the level to High may cause some websites to work improperly, you can add sites that you know are safe to use to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work properly even with the High security setting.\n\nAdd a firewall to your Internet connection. A firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to and from a private network. It can implemented in both hardware and software, or a combination of both. When you connect to a website or send\/receive email, the traffic will pass through the firewall, which examines each request and message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria.\n\nAnd after you've \"cleaned house,\" it's imperative to maintain this protection.\n\nApply all available operating system patches. Windows can be configured to download updates automatically. It is imperative to keep your system as up to date as possible.\n\nBack up your data regularly. If your computer is infected to the point that you need to reinstall all of your software, a backup can be the lifesaver for your data.\n\nBe suspicious! Don't give your trust (and potentially your identity, bank account number, and ultimately, your moola) away! If you frequent websites that request your email address to send you announcements and special offers, then expect to receive lots of attention. Be suspicious of any email requesting personal information. Expect that some downloaded file from websites are infected with viruses. Assume that every email attachment from an unknown source is infected. And use the tools recommended to keep your computer protected.\n\nAs we all know, the issue of information security is dependent on the actions that we, as users, take. If we don't do everything within our power to protect our information, we are the biggest part of the problem. Therefore, it is ultimately our responsibility to take advantage of the tools and processes available to identify and clean up problems and establish a level of security required to protect our data."}
{"text":"Computer Crime (cybercrime, e-crime) refers to criminal activity that involves the use of a computer and the internet. These can be traditional criminal offenses committed with the use of a computer and newer crimes that originated with the advent of computers and networks. These crimes cover a very large and diverse range of offenses.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) divides computer crime into three general categories: 1) The crime of obtaining computer hardware, peripherals, and software illegally; 2) Crimes that actually target a computer network or device directly (Computer hacking; viruses; worms; Trojan horses; logic bombs; malware; sniffers; bots, spyware, etc.); and 3) Crimes committed through the use of computer networks or devices (Cyberspace Crime), although the crime committed does not target the actual computer or the network (Fraud and identity theft: phishing and pharming scams; corporate espionage; embezzlement; copyright infringement with software, music and movie piracy; cyber terrorism; child pornography trafficking, and more).\n\nThere are more than 40 federal statutes that govern the prosecution of computer-related crimes, as well as various state statutes.\n\nComputer Crime Law - US\n\nIn response to concerns that emerging technologies such as digital and wireless communications were making it increasingly difficult for law enforcement agencies to execute authorized surveillance, Congress enacted CALEA on October 25, 1994. CALEA was intended to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct electronic surveillance by requiring that telecommunications carriers and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment modify and design their equipment, facilities, and services to ensure that they have the necessary surveillance capabilities.\n\nPresentation of a summary chart of recently prosecuted computer cases. Many cases have been prosecuted under the computer crime statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71030. This listing is a representative sample; it is not exhaustive. Click on the name of the case to read a press release about the case.\n\nThe Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) is responsible for implementing the Department's national strategies in combating computer and intellectual property crimes worldwide. The Computer Crime Initiative is a comprehensive program designed to combat electronic penetrations, data thefts, and cyberattacks on critical information systems. CCIPS prevents, investigates, and prosecutes computer crimes by working with other government agencies, the private sector, academic institutions, and foreign counterparts.\n\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was enacted in 1998. The basic\npurpose of the DMCA is to amend Title 17 of the United States Code and to\nimplement the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty\nand Performances and Phonograms Treaty, which were designed to update\nworld copyright laws to deal with the new technology.\n\nIn addition to laws specifically tailored to deal with computer crimes, traditional\nlaws can also be used to prosecute crimes involving computers. For example\nthe Economic Espionage Act (EEA) was passed in 1996 and was created in\norder to put a stop to trade secret misappropriation.\n\nPassed in 1986, Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was an\namendment to the federal wiretap law, the Act made it illegal to intercept stored\nor transmitted electronic communication without authorization.\n\nThe FBI's cyber mission is four-fold: first and foremost, to stop those behind the most serious computer intrusions and the spread of malicious code; second, to identify and thwart online sexual predators who use the Internet to meet and exploit children and to produce, possess, or share child pornography; third, to counteract operations that target U.S. intellectual property, endangering our national security and competitiveness; and fourth, to dismantle national and transnational organized criminal enterprises engaging in Internet fraud. Pursuant to the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace signed by the President, the Department of Justice and the FBI lead the national effort to investigate and prosecute cybercrime.\n\nSection 1030(a)(1) makes it illegal to access a computer without authorization or\nin excess of one's authorization and obtain information about national defense,\nforeign relations, or restricted data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 19549,\nwhich covers all data concerning design, manufacture or utilization of atomic\nweapons and production of nuclear material. It is worth noting that section\n1030(a)(1) requires proof that the individual knowingly accessed the computer\nwithout authority or in excess of authorization for the purpose of obtaining\nclassified or protected information. Section 1030(a)(1) criminalizes the use of a\ncomputer to gain access to the information, not the unauthorized possession of it\nor its transmission.\n\nFOISA attempts to tackle the\nproblem of criminals registering online domains under false identification, it\nincludes a provision that would increase jail times for people who provide false\ncontact information to a domain name registrar and then use that domain to\ncommit copyright and trademark infringement crimes.\n\nTo establish broadband policy and direct the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a proceeding and public broadband summits to assess competition, consumer protection, and consumer choice issues relating to broadband Internet access services, and for other purposes.\n\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, first enacted in 1984 and revised in 1994, makes it certain activities designed to access a \"federal interest computer\" illegal. These activities may range from knowingly accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access to the transmission of a harmful component of a program, information, code, or command. A federal interest computer includes a computer used by a financial institution, used by the United States Government, or one of two or more computers used in committing the offense, not all of which are located in the same State. The Legal Institute provides Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which encompasses the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nComputer Related Crimes Law\n\nCA's Global Security Advisor is the place to check for current information on global threats that is researched and published via a network of rapid response centers around the world delivering:\nComprehensive validated virus, spyware and vulnerability databases\nClean-up utilities, detection signatures files and remediation instructions\nValuable documentation on implementing complete threat protection and security management solutions.\n\nDespite The law makes no exception for business-to-business email. That means all email \u2013 for example, a message to former customers announcing a new product line \u2013 must comply with the law.\n\nComputer piracy is reproduction, distribution and use of software without permission of the owner of copyright.\nKinds of illegal software use that can be qualified as copyright violation:\n- selling of computer facilities with illegally installed software;\n- replication and distribution of software copies on information carriers without permission of the copyright owner;\n- illegal distribution of software through communication networks (Internet, e-mail, etc.);\n- illegal use of software by the user.\n\nThe news said that another person had their identity stolen. It happened again. You might even know of someone that had it happen to them. We often hear of percentages - and they are surprisingly high.\nEnforcement is taking place, but we have to wonder if computer hacking laws are really having any effect against cyber hacking. This article will show what is being done against cyber crime.\n\nIn a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, an attacker attempts to prevent legitimate users from accessing information or services. By targeting your computer and its network connection, or the computers and network of the sites you are trying to use, an attacker may be able to prevent you from accessing email, web sites, online accounts (banking, etc.), or other services that rely on the affected computer.\nThe most common and obvious type of DoS attack occurs when an attacker \"floods\" a network with information. When you type a URL for a particular web site into your browser, you are sending a request to that site's computer server to view the page. The server can only process a certain number of requests at once, so if an attacker overloads the server with requests, it can't process your request. This is a \"denial of service\" because you can't access that site.\n\nEmail hoaxes spread misinformation, waste bandwidth, and lessen the effectiveness of email as a communication medium. Hoax-Slayer helps stop the continued circulation of these hoaxes by publishing information about them. Hoax-Slayer allows Internet users to check the veracity of a large number of common email hoaxes. Information about new hoaxes is added on a regular basis.\n\nOur mission is to give consumers the information they need to avoid becoming victims of telemarketing and Internet fraud and to help them get their complaints to law enforcement agencies quickly and easily.\n\nComputer Crime Law - International\n\nThe tremendous growth in the use of information technology and Internet has brought us great convenience. However, it also creates a great potential for abuse by criminals. With the cross-border, open-platform, highly-interconnected nature of this virtual dimension, the impacts of cyber crimes are far-reaching, and would require integral effort from all parties involved in order to effectively combat cyber crimes.\n\nOrganizations Related to Computer Crime Law\n\nAs agreed by the AHTCC Board of Management, the four core functions of the AHTCC included:\n1. Policy advocacy;\n2. Strategic intelligence support;\n3. Crime prevention and education; and\n4. Capability development.\nIn June 2007, the AHTCC Board of Management agreed that the AHTCC would transfer from being a nationally-governed centre to becoming a dedicated AFP portfolio, retaining its national focus. The transfer became effective 1 October 2007, and a new High Tech Crime Operations (HTCO) portfolio was officially launched on 1 March 2008.\n\nThe Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit public policy organization dedicated to promoting the democratic potential of today's open, decentralized global Internet. Our mission is to conceptualize, develop, and implement public policies that will keep the Internet open, innovative and free.\n\nThe CERT\u00ae Program is part of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), a federally funded research and development center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Following the Morris worm incident, which brought 10 percent of internet systems to a halt in November 1988, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) charged the SEI with setting up a center to coordinate communication among experts during security emergencies and to help prevent future incidents. This center was named the CERT Coordination Center (CERT\/CC).FIRST is the premier organization and recognized global leader in incident response. Membership in FIRST enables incident response teams to more effectively respond to security incidents reactive as well as proactive.\nFIRST brings together a variety of computer security incident response teams from government, commercial, and educational organizations. FIRST aims to foster cooperation and coordination in incident prevention, to stimulate rapid reaction to incidents, and to promote information sharing among members and the community at large.\n\nOn May 10-11, 2004, Attorney General John Ashcroft and Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge met in Washington, DC with the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs from the G8 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and with the European Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs. There were four primary topics of discussion: prevention of terrorism and serious criminal acts; border and transportation security; combating cybercrime and enhancing cyber-investigations; and fighting foreign official corruption and recovering stolen national assets.\n\nThe High Technology Crime Investigation Association (HTCIA) is designed to encourage, promote, aid and effect the voluntary interchange of data, information, experience, ideas and knowledge about methods, processes, and techniques relating to investigations and security in advanced technologies among its membership.\n\nThe Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is a partnership between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C),\nand the Bureau of Justice Assistance\n(BJA).\nIC3's mission is and international level, IC3 provides a central referral\nmechanism for complaints involving Internet related crimes\n\nThe Internet offers a global marketplace for consumers and businesses. But crooks also recognize the potentials of cyberspace. The same scams that have been conducted by mail and phone can now be found on the World Wide Web and in email, and new cyberscams are emerging. It's sometimes hard to tell the difference between reputable online sellers and criminals who use the Internet to rob people. You can protect yourself by learning how to recognize the danger signs of fraud. If you are a victim or attempted victim of Internet fraud, it's important to report the scam quickly so that law enforcement agencies can shut the fraudulent operations down.\n\nInterpol has actively been involved for a number of years in combating Information Technology Crime. Rather than 're-inventing the wheel', the Interpol General Secretariat has harnessed the expertise of its members in the field of Information Technology Crime (ITC) through the vehicle of a 'working party' or a group of experts. In this instance, the working party consists of the heads or experienced members of national computer crime units. These working parties have been designed to reflect regional expertise and exist in Europe, Asia, America and in Africa. All working parties are in different stages of development. It should be noted that the work done by the working parties is not Interpol's only contribution to combating ITC, but it certainly represents the most noteworthy contribution to date.\n\nPublications Related to Computer Crime Law\n\nThe advent of the computer did not create a new crime, any more than than development of the automobile created a new form of larceny. As with the automobile, the criminal use of computer technology has increased the vulnerability of the community, and to the extent that the definition of crimes and the enactment of prohibitions is directed to the protection of the community, computer technology is a legitimate area of penal concern.\n\nArticles on HG.org Related to Computer Crime Law\n\nInternet solicitation of children and teens has been a persistent problem following the immense popularity of the Internet as a means of information and communication. The state of Florida has put in place adequate laws to deal with this problem firmly and reduce the risk of Internet surfers becoming victims of such online solicitation.\n\nWhile the Internet, email, smartphones, and the widespread usage of social media sites have improved our lives in many ways, they have also unfortunately become the breeding grounds for new types of crimeEmployers are becoming increasingly concerned about knowing whether applicants have criminal records. Part of this concern stems from large jury verdicts that have been rendered against employers for negligently hiring people with criminal histories who subsequently caused harm to others while on the jobIt may surprise you to learn that the majority of crimes committed inside of casinos do not involve the gambling itself. Instead, the 10 casinos in Pennsylvania reported that accounts of theft of wallets and purses for this year far outweighed the crimes of passing counterfeit money and forgery. Part of the reason for this shift in the type of crimes committed involves the modernization of gambling machines.\n\nA little over a year ago, Naperville Illinois resident Travis Edwards was convicted of computer fraud, computer tampering and cyberstalking related to his ex-girlfriend, who was attending Northern Illinois University.\n\nIn a decision filed on April 10, 2012, the Ninth Circuit in United States of America v. Nosal, No. 10-10038 (9th Cir. 2012), put itself squarely in conflict with the Fifth, Eleventh and Seventh Circuits."}
{"text":"Posted\nby\nkdawsonon Friday November 28, 2008 @11:21AM from the my-agent.btz-will-call-you dept.\n\nkillmofasta notes an LA Times story on a severe and widespread attack on US military computers that may have originated in Russia. Turns out the military's recent ban on flash drives was a precursor to this attack, which was significant enough that the President and the Defense Secretary were briefed on it. \"The 'malware' strike, thought to be from inside Russia, hit combat zone computers and the US Central Command overseeing Iraq and Afghanistan. The attack underscores concerns about computer warfare. 'This one was significant; this one got our attention,' said one defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity when discussing internal assessments. Although officials are withholding many details, the attack underscores the increasing danger and potential significance of computer warfare, which defense experts say could one day be used by combatants to undermine even a militarily superior adversary. ... [A defense official said] 'We have taken a number of corrective measures, but I would be overstating it if I said we were through this.'\"\n\nSupreme Commander\/General Eisenhower warned us to be wary of the military-industrial complex's desire to create wars just to keep themselves in business, and we already caught them in a recent lie (WMDs in Iraq that never existed). How do we know this \"computer war\" happened and is not just another made-up story to try to get trillions more dollars & keep the military-industrial companies employed?\n\nHow do we know that it's not retaliation for an attack on Russian computers that originated from US military networks?\n\nWhen we start hearing news stories about computer attacks from Latvia, Peru, or some small country in the far east perhaps they can be believed. Right now the news is all about attacks from people that the current administration would like to demonize. That makes the believability of these reports a little less than zero IMO. It sounds like pure propaganda at this point. If it is real, it's probably part of a cat\/mouse game that we've been playing with them all along. Anyone who has been in the US military knows that we play war games all the time with Russia. Look up news on the USS Augusta, search for news about submarines a week before and after, you'll see that it hit a Russian sub in a bad game of chicken. Why would computer networks be any different? I bet there are teams of IT people that set up honey pot networks just for this kind of war game. It would be stupid to believe otherwise.\n\nwell the simplest solution is to look at non US news sources. frequently the BBC posts stories about US military hours before american news outlets do. Pull your head out of your arse, and look at some else's news for a while. France while a some what ally will publish news that American news outlets won't as they are considered \"sensitive\" or not news worthy(read latest actress scandal is more important).\n\n*sigh* this is just so stupid it's hard to decide where to begin, but I'll try :\n\nWhen you see an American article, in English, you always see \"AP\", \"AFP\" under it. There is a third agency, but it's name escapes me for now.\n\nAP stands for associated press, which is not American AFP stands for \"agence france-presse\" which is french.\n\nThey cooperate with one another, hardly ever making double coverage, so in practice an article with AP under it might have come from AFP. They both translate those articles in over 30 languages, and give their clients, like cnn, the right to copy them verbatim.\n\nSo 1\/3rd (in theory, in practice more) of all the news you see has been collected by French reporters, or at least reporters paid by french people.\n\nYou will find nearly all news duplicated across the atlantic in practice. Everybody agrees having a singular entity collect all news is a terrible idea. Everybody also agrees that it's cheaper, so it wasn't a contest at all.\n\nAlso keep in mind that e.g. during the Israel-Lebanon (or rather Israel vs Lebanese terrorists that Lebanon couldn't (and can't) deal with, who are therefore in massive violation of just about every international treaty by their existence alone), AFP hired a Hezbollah \"kolonel\" to collect news for them (he had very good access to the battlefield, you see, and he didn't tell AFP about his position). This is then passed of as \"impartial\" information.\n\nAP stands for associated press, which is not American AFP stands for \"agence france-presse\" which is french....\n\nSo 1\/3rd (in theory, in practice more) of all the news you see has been collected by French reporters, or at least reporters paid by french people.\n\nDo you really believe that this is true? For a start, the world's largest broadcasting news gathering organisation is the BBC, which is British. Secondly, I was under the impression that U.S. news broadcasters mostly ignore international issues an\n\na few years back when the american Sub hit a japanese fishing trawler, I heard about it from the BBC 3 hours earlier than CNN, FOX, or NBC began to air what happened.\n\nthe AP had it but it wasn't news worthy for hours afterwards. I didn't say other news sources wouldn't be biased as well, but if you want to know what is happening in the USA try an external news source first.\n\nAnother point the hotel shooting in India. the USA news sources are focusing 90% of their coverage on the 3 americans inside, more or e\n\nHow do we know that it's not retaliation for an attack on Russian computers that originated from US military networks?\n\nI'm not sure it matters. Whether US military computers were choosing to load and execute foreign code as a result of a foreign first strike, or a foreign counter-attack, we still have the situation that US military computers are loading and executing untrusted code, and apparently unsandboxed, so that it ended up mattering.\n\nI don't care why it happened at the political level; I care about why it's happening at the computer or operator level. People using \"important\" computers shouldn't be doing that, nor should their computers be making it easy for them to do that.\n\nNo matter why the military computers were attacked, the fact that the attack worked proves incompetence.\n\nYes lets forget about the Russia's recent aggression into Georgia\nLets also pretend Russia isn't going to finish building Irans first nuclear plant in 2009\nLets not acknowledge that Medvedev just signed a nuclear deal with Venezuela\nLets forget all the recent _obvious_ Russian aggression against the United States and just skip to the part where you make up facts out of thin air about the US attacking Russian computers. Then lets take this big steamy pile of B.s. and mod it plus 5 cause its anti-american and\n\nWell, since your handle is 'Pros_n_Cons' perhaps we should revisit the news:\n\nGeorgia started the strife with Russia - not the other way around. Russia has been trying to get in on Iranian nuclear power to sell them stuff for a long time. The politics of the middle east is complex enough that no slashdot post will explain it all. Russia still needs warm water ports. Iran is a strategically valid place for them. Russia actually offered to help settle the sabre rattling over nuclear power in Iran by assisting wi\n\nI work for these people, and frankly I don't trust them. I'd personally be happy to give up my job in order to bring the Congressional budget into the black & reduce taxpayer burdens, but I know many of my colleagues would not. They want to keep their jobs regardless of cost (or lies).\n\nI don't trust any upper-level manager in any industry, but especially not in DoD contracting, and I certainly don't trust DoD civilians to be honest or competent.\nThis is taking place during the transition between Administrations, so someone at the DoD hierarchy wants to make a show about how they are \"protecting America\" when everyone in the commercial sector dealt with the agent.btz trojan quietly months ago.\n\nEasy to keep the military systems safe, don't plug them into the internet...that way people all the way from Russia wont be able to hack them if there is no access....it would only be something from within, and this we already have a budget for, not need more money for it as a separate expenditure\n\nwhile i don't doubt that electronic warfare is being actively developed by other nations (i'm sure the U.S. armed forces aren't the only military interested in, or actively developing, electronic warfare tactics), i wouldn't put it past the MIC to exaggerate the risk of electronic attacks in order to manipulate the public. it certainly wouldn't be the first time the public was mislead about our nation's defense in order to funnel tax dollars into unnecessary defense projects. and now with war logistics being an more lucrative than ever through the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program [corpwatch.org] (LOGCAP) and its cost-plus award-fee contracts, even more more private sector companies have a vested interest in seeing a renewed Cold-War-type international tension and corresponding military spending.\n\nit's just too bad Americans never heeded Eisenhower's farewell address [wikisource.org]. of course, if more people working in the defense industry were truly patriotic, they'd all be as morally enlightened as you, and the MIC wouldn't exist.\n\nThe whole point of the inspections was to make positively sure that Saddam didn't have any. I'm assuming you agree that's better than thinking he probably-maybe-not-sure doesn't then finding out that you're wrong, in the form of a big fireball over some city?\n\nAnswer this, if he didn't have any and wasn't in the process of making any, why was he so keen to get rid of the inspectors?\n\nEverybody who says he didn't have WMD (on the basis of what we know now) is just a Monday morning quarterback. Hindsight is al\n\nBullshit. Those of us outside the feverish and patriotic US Propaganda machine could see that machine heavily at work.\n\nYes it was entirely plausible that Saddam had WMD, so yes it was expedient to send in inspectors. When said inspectors turned up absolutely nothing, that wasn't the answer America wanted to hear, since \"Something had to be done about 911!\".\n\nThat is the result of the disfunctional and undemocratic security council where the USA has a vetoe. Don't confuse security council resolutions for something representing world opinion. It is the general assembly that is democratic and representative, the security council is a private club.\n\nThere are so many mainstream sources around UNSCOM and the IAEA that have come forward since the Iraq war that the truth is no longer in question. It goes like this:\n\nFirstly, the Iraqi military and economy had been smashed by the first gulf war and subsequent sanctions.\n\nSecondly, Hussein and the rest weren't stupid and clearly knew the US government, public and media were all baying for war.\n\nThirdly, the UNSCOM inspections were very thorough and even well funded and equipped (largely by the US taxpayer) and had a great deal of success in pressurizing the Iraqi regime into getting rid of what it had left, which in any case wasn't much because it was all so old. Dozens of Iraqi army officers defected through Syria or Jordan and confirmed the story.\n\nBecause of all this, successive administrations tried and failed to find a pretext to war. Parent is entirely correct - it's the defense industry wanting cash and the government finding any excuse to pump tax dollars to their well-to-do pals. It's good for the economy, according to the politicians.\n\nWhat helped most of all to tip the balance in favour of war was when someone or other (probably the CIA) forged a now infamous document purporting to show the sale of yellow-cake uranium by Niger to Iraq. It was by all accounts a hilariously bad forgery and contained many, many obvious errors that clearly showed it could not be genuine. However, the White House released it to the media as genuine, who immediately, without checking it, presented it as causus belli to the trusting public. By the time the IAEA's Mohammed El Baradei announced a couple of days later that it was utterly false, it was too late. Not that the same, supposedly liberal media made a big deal of that.\n\nThat, my friend, is how rich, powerful people can manipulate the public into doing whatever they see as necessary, even when it calls for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of normal, working class people on all sides.\n\nThese are professional liars, folks! This is a part of the Military disinformation effort - so publicly trumpeted right here on Slashdot - not so long ago.\n\nIf there had been any such REAL significance to this 'attack', do you think that it would be published and publicly acknowledged? There are very minor cold-war-era incidents and slip-ups that are still highly-classified, and never acknowledged.\n\nI suppose this to be a non-event of ordinary malware, that is being used to: 1) Shape public opinion and generate suspicion 2) Justify restrictions on the Internet access\/speech of military personnel 3) Profit!\n\nThe US military is not stupid, and does take systems security very seriously. What would look like ultra-paranoid behavior to a civilian may well be fully justified in the military world.\n\nThe reason is simple: any breach, leak, or DoS can result in somebody being killed, operations foiled, or even wars lost.\n\nSecurity people have to guard against known threats and techniques, which are very challenging, plus unknown ones that nobody has even thought to consider. Being able to trust the technology that they ar\n\nI bet the infection is having trouble spreading because every time it tries to install it crashes out with the error \"Please exit the following programs: US Government Trojan before attempting to install Russian Government Trojan.\"But surely there are just evil dudes and dragons beyond our borders jealous about our freedoms (ignore DRM, unwarranted phone snooping, etc for this argument)? I know for sure that there are ice dragons and Igloo dwellers to the north. To the east there is meant to be an old continent, but I am yet to be convinced of its existence.;)\n\nYea we have it tough in America (DRM, IP rights, a well publicized illegal actions by the government). I much rather live in a country that will kill you if you say something unpatriotic loud enough, or just reported it.\n\nYes, there are countries worse than us, much worse. But, there are also countries better than us. I find it odd that we went from claiming \"We're the bastion to freedom\" to claiming \"We're not as bad as random Muslim theocracies, and some African anarchies, and perhaps China!\". We should be striving to be the most free country in the world again, and not just mediocre.\n\nAs for all of our other metrics, we're failing. Sure, we're better than Congo, but who isn't (besides the Congo)? Its like murdering som\n\nIt would be equally silly to ignore the fact that China, Russia and certain other countries have well-funded technical and military intelligence collection programs that have been running for many decades, and explicitly target the United States.\n\nYou're absolutely right and I completely agree - I'm not saying that this wasn't sponsored by or carried out by a foreign nation, but that we should not conclude that this is the case. It is very likely that this attack was from a foreign nation, and if it wasn't, there will be others.\n\nIn this case one should also remember that the US has similar programs that explicitly target Russia and China. And so, perhaps, it would make sense to better protect one's own networks than to blame the Russians and the Chinese for every security breach. Even if they are responsible. Especially if they are responsible. This way the Pentagon may only appear vulnerable, as opposed to vulnerable AND incompetent.\n\nNot only headline is misleading, RTFA clearly states that source of the malware is not identified. And this wasnt targeted attack I assume, some stupid fuck just ran piece of malware on secure computer and it spreaded. Of course to make things big and get money on \"cyberdefense\" there should be some country to blame.\n\nI'm not sure how things work in Russia (if the state owns the networks or not) but wouldn't it be the ISP or bandwidth provider ignoring this?\n\nI know, I know, ISPs can't (and shouldn't) be held responsible for this sort of thing, but just jumping at the Russian government because technically the copper(or fiber, or whatever) exists in Russian territory is a little bit silly IMHO.\n\nReally the only way that we could hold a foreign government responsible for the actions of their citizens on the Internet would be to expect government oversight on all the packets floating around on the networks that exist within their territories. I highly doubt that there are many people on slashdot that would advocate that. Really, the Internet needs to exist separately from real-world governments. I know that some are in favor of having no regulatory body of any kind on the networks, but I think things are starting to get out of hand. A government that exists for the internet only is starting to make sense, especially since people who have studied traditional, physical-world-based law have generally don't know head from ass when it comes to computer networks.\n\nThe global ramifications of this stance are more nuanced than that. It would be a sign of good faith if the Russian government were to prosecute the parties responsible for an attack on a foreign military body. Conversely, it is a sign of complacence if they do not.\n\nBasically, the problems that the network can create are too many and too serious for the governments of the world to ignore. This doesn't mean 'Net Neutrality is impossible, but it means security reforms is going to have to happen sooner\n\nI love the way these things are always spun as if they are significant military attacks coordinate by the foreign government or their agents. Is there any evidence that it isn't just a few bored teenagers who happen to live in Russia and think it would be fun to try and hack the US DOD?\n\nThe Russian Empire was doing a lot of really bad stuff way before the USSR was even thought of. Of course, the British Empire, the Japanese Empire, the French Empire etc. all imposed by force their rule of law.\n\nI don't really understand what you mean by that so I don't feel terribly informed. Could you elaborate a bit? What happened in Georgia was a gong show all around, but that aside, I would consider the South Ossetian separatists to at least be Russian backed (i.e. their agents). So I'm not sure how that demonstrates 'a few bored teenagers who happen to live in Russia' are effectively the same as the Russian government or their agents.\n\nAnd what do you thing has happened in Georgia? To tell the long story short -- Russia has stopped a Georgian assault on its citizens (most people in South Osetia have Russian citizenship) and made Georgia return to negotiations with South Osetia.\n\nThe propaganda machine is working very well though. Next you'll tell that the Russians have violated Germany's sovereignty in 1945 and made their democratic elected leader commit suicide.\n\nIt probably is some windows worm or something written by a script-kiddie. But to admit that would be to embarrassing, so they make it out to be a big deal.\n\nIt is exactly this vain \"cover-my-ass\" attitude that makes situations escalate, sometimes up to the point of war. I understand that a bunch of old farts in DoD feel a strong need to justify (or increase) their Cyberwarfare budgets but pointing fingers at an allied country (relations with which are not always easy) in public over a non-issue like this is, imho, going way too far.\n\nNetwork security by isolation of the critical parts is possible and this whole \"cyberwarfare\"-bullshit is just driving tears into the eyes of anyone who knows a bit about the subject. Yes, an attacker could overload and DoS less important\/perimeter networks and yes an attacker may able to overtake various individual machines or department networks, e.g. by sneaking trojans onto employee's computers, phishing etc.\n\nIf any of that worries you in a national-security kind of way then do your fucking homework and implement appropiate security layers and airgaps already! A flash trojan is a non-issue because a critical system won't run flash. In fact, a critical system won't even interface with a system that could be taken over in such a way.\n\nTo be fair, it's not like when the US reports these attacks to China\/Russia they do anything about them to suggest you might be right though.\n\nIt's the same with the whole Litvinenko thing here in the UK, we know where the Polonium came from (a Russian lab) we even pretty much know Lugovoi did it but as they wont help whatsoever to put him to trial and have instead put him into their parliament in a position of power it's kind of hard to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nMaybe if they actually helped bring these perpetrators to justice we could give them the benefit of the doubt as you suggest, but when they instead protect the almost certainly guilt with no real trial or investigation then it only adds to the idea that the governments of these nations themselves are in fact responsible.\n\nIf a bunch of Canadians crossed the US border and attacked the US and then made it back to Canada safely and the Canadian government did nothing about it or even went as far as giving these people places in government as per the Luogovoi\/Litvinenko affair then yeah I think most people would still say the Canadian government deserves a lot of the blame.\n\nDon't get me wrong however, I do feel these \"cyber attacks\" are a little overstated, I hate to say it but it's becoming so common when I read about them I can't help but think \"Who cares, stop moaning and either return the favour or learn from it and stop it happening again\". As is pointed out here on Slashdot often though, they don't seem to learn from their mistakes and instead simply repeat them over and over. I'm not sure what the US government is trying to achieve with these cries? Trying to make us hate Russia\/China? Don't worry their human rights record means a lot of us already do. Trying to get sympathy? Well what for? You're the military, you're the ones who are meant to be dealing with it and so on.\n\nOr in other words, to put it simply- they're all just as bad as each other.\n\nIt doesn't take propaganda to show you that Russia's run by a bunch of corrupt jerks. Their premier is making a big deal about being a big macho tough guy, like shooting tigers [guardian.co.uk] and playing at being USSR version II, invading Georgia,\n(funny how people around here are all \"US imperialism in Iraq! evil! bad!\" and won't say a thing about \"Russian imperialism in Georgia!\"), sending big boats down to Cuba to show off, et cetera. Blah. Whatever. Saber-rattli\n\n>funny how people around here are all \"US imperialism in Iraq! evil! bad!\" and won't say a thing about \"Russian imperialism in Georgia!\" Because Russia didn't capture the whole country looking for non-existent WMD's and didn't hang Georgia's president?:) Besides, Russian troops have already left Georgia.\n\nCome on, at least pretend you did some research on the topic instead of repeating what the Big Media has conveniently provided to you. Georgian government wanted to strike down the separatism in self-decl\n\nExacketilly - Russia is not our enemy. Russia is an ally and has been an ally for hundreds of years. Sure, there has been the ocational minor disagreement, but in times of war Russia, UK, France and USA always stick together.\nI know that is contrary to what CNN and others would like it to be, but the facts are otherwise.\n\nI work with the USAF in a very official capacity in IT and got wind of the flash media ban a while back.\n\nI've been asked to keep quiet about this, but since it isn't classified, and nobody takes slashdot seriously, take this for what it is worth:\n\nWe stopped using all flash media on all networks because we can no longer be confident that they do not come from the factory with payloads attached. I've seen entire boxes of flash media from the \"amnesty boxes\" set up inside USAF buildings sent off to NSA and FBI for investigation.\n\nThere are some who think that manufacturers have been infiltrated with the sole purpose of loading malware onto drives. And it isn't that it's specifically an attack on US Gov. computers - it's just that Gov. networks tend to be pretty incestuous, and flash drives are often moved back and forth between multiple computers daily by most users due to the flakiness of CAC (common access card) infrastructure.\n\nWhat's the point of putting malware if it won't be run? Or did I miss something, and \"autorun\" actually works on UMS devices in Windows?\n\nYes, it does. But, it's relatively easy to disable.\n\nUse a Microsoft \"PowerToys\" application to simply disable all drives: Tweak UI [wikipedia.org]. It's only available for XP, at least from Microsoft. There is reportedly a version for Vista from a third-party developer.\n\nWell, yeah. The problem is that flash drives are commonly used to bridge air gaps. The air gaps are there to isolate networks and and force manual transfer of data, but if the manual transfer method cannot be trusted then then something needs to be done about it.\nBanning flash drives may help, but it still leaves CDROMs and DVDs as a medium to bridge air gaps, so banning flash drives is just a temporary knee-jerk reaction really.\nThe only long term solution is to stop using Mickey Mouse operating system\n\nThe bad thing about this was that all major malware\/virus software has had protection against it since June.\nSo what had to of happened is some office with a high ranking official was not keeping their protection software up to date or disabled it, both against existing regulations.\nThey then ran into problem and it spread across their network and they spread the alarm. At that point it got high enough that you got the new requirements.\n\nThe federal government is finally starting to see the fruits of its trifecta of asinine spending policies:\n\n1) Lowest bidder (God forbid we get the best value for the tax dollar, not the cheapest). 2) Standard pay rates that don't take into serious consideration the skills and experience of employees. God forbid we adopt private sector pay policies because that might make us look like we're discriminating if some employees get paid a lot less than others. 3) The fact that it often takes an act of Congress to fire a federal employee.\n\nLike most Northern Virginia-based software engineers, I've worked a federal contract here and there. I've been exposed to incompetence from federal employees that would not be tolerated by almost any corporation. My company actually brought a formal business case for why our government program manager was wrong and her decisions would be a disastrous waste of tax payer money to her bosses. We **pleaded* with them to override her and let our senior engineer do the architecture since she had no idea how to do it.\n\nGuess what? They told us to shut up and get back in line.\n\nThere's this myth that the outsourcing of government has ruined the federal government. That's bullshit. Government contractors are often the only people who actually get shit done! We're the ones who actually do much of the heavy lifting because the civil service for so long was allowed to deteriorate into a combination of an affirmative action program and a welfare program for stupid white men.\n\nThere are real pockets of genuine competence and intelligence in the federal government, but unfortunately, they're so isolated by the prevailing culture and leadership that it would take a real Leviathan-wrangler at least 2 presidential terms to get any meaningful culling done.\n\nStandard pay rates that don't take into serious consideration the skills and experience of employees. God forbid we adopt private sector pay policies because that might make us look like we're discriminating if some employees get paid a lot less than others.\n\nPrivate sector pay policies? As someone who works in the private sector, I can pretty much guarantee that private sector companies also use standard pay grades. Why is it that everybody thinks that private sector is a bastion of efficiency. I've wor\n\nThe US Military does not always choose the lowest bidder. The military is, in effect, a huge welfare program. Many times, we choose the vendor that provides the best social benefit. For instance, the GSA program gives additional weight to women-owned or minority-owned businesses.\n\nAs for pay, the military takes teenagers off the street and puts them in charge of some of the most complex systems in the world. When IBM hires a 19yo high-school grad and put him in charge of corporate email servers, then US m\n\nThey don't use a lot of Windows on internal systems in the DoD. As I'm to understand, they run a lot more Linux and Solaris. In the interests of national security, though, all these systems are too close to make a big difference security-wise.\n\nThey may have different levels of attackability for circumstances relating to casual attacks and casual computer use (this is where we say \"is the default linux installation in X version of linux more or less secure than the default windows installation in Y version of windows?) But when these systems have proper internal security policies set up, it doesn't make a huge difference-- when they are well configured, they're functionally the same.\n\nDoD systems are generally set up so that one is connected to the internal network and one to the external network-- when you want to move a file, you simply use a flash drive. The chances are very good that these are running different operating systems, anyway.\n\nFor a coordinated and advanced attack on our DoD network infrastructure it has less to do with what operating systems we are running, which is really just a question of usability and administration time, but moreso broader questions of security policy-- such as where do you get your flash drives?\n\nIn short, if one OS was the issue here, this attack couldn't have gotten anywhere. An OS really doesn't mean much when you compare it to the overall security model for the network infrastructure, especially with the physical network restrictions used by the DoD.\n\nThe biggest difference for the operating systems for their purposes would be more on features like TPM-enabled drive encryption, etc-- things that would make it more difficult to hack a stolen laptop-- stuff like that.\n\n\"may have originated in Russia\" is not the same as \"originated with the Russian government,\" of course.\n\nMy guess, the attacks are an attempt to turn the vast power of military computer systems into one giant spam-bot.\n\nAnd, also, just think of all the new Nigerian scam letters that they could pull off with military connections... the \"your son was wounded in Iraq and is being airlifted to a hospital in Germany, please send $10,000 to pay for a private room for him\" scam will be much more powerful if it issues from a military computer (and, for that matter, much more convincing if the scammer knows the actual name, rank, and next-of-kin of the 'son').\n\nIf thse attacks are successful, they will replace the old practice of dropping leaflets on enemy soldiers... Now when the modern soldier opens his e-mail, he will be greeted with \"Feeling ashamed of your small willy, we can help\" etc etc\n\nSo, the other day, i thought that my girlfriend would like the present i gave her... God was i wrong...\n\nNow they think that the attack comes from Russia... That means they're not sure about it at all, they just got a hunch that the attack is from the Russians, they don't say they got proof or anything, they just say they think it's from there...\n\nJust because the relations with the Russians aren't that good doesn't automatically mean they'll attack you in Irak...\n\nReading the article, which has almost no details, I think the LA Times is trying to make news out of nothing. The \"senior military leaders\" are basically like \"senior business executives\" who probably have no clue about any actual \"attacks\". They are just trying to hype up anything they can to increase their budgets.\n\nThe actual details they are dealing with is the same as any organization that uses computers and employs people.\n\n\"That is the odd thing... you never hear about the huge attacks on the Chinese, Russian, North Korean, etc.\"\n\nNot hearing is not the same as not happening. They may and probably DO not talk about those incidents. We live in a free-er society, and this stuff comes out because our press is marginally functional. That is, when it's not being willingly led by the nose by the current 'cause'. And slamming the current administration is always good business for our press.\n\n...experts have not pinpointed the source or motive of the attack and could not say whether the destructive program was created by an individual hacker or whether the Russian government may have had some involvement.\n\nClassic propoganda. Shame on Julian Barnes of the LA Times and the unnamed senior military leaders.\n\nI would have expected that on a military level, all\nsoftware and operating systems used should be compiled\nfrom source, the source checked and risky features locked\ndown. That would exclude proprietary operating systems\nlike windows and mac OX and even prepackaged open source\nsystems. Its probably not cheaper but cases like this should\nbe wake up calls.\n\n\"And almost as stupidly simple as banning soldiers from e-mailing and blogging on the public internet that, ummm, their families are on and, ummm, OK, maybe we need publicly accessible DoD computers.\"\n\nPublicly accessible terminals or kiosks that don't contain any pertinent information what-so-ever, and also don't allow flashdrives (since they could, conceivably, contain sensitive information), could be set up in a DMZ to allow personnel to communicate with the \"outside world\" without security concerns. Sort\n\nI think that, right now, no one is really sure what to do. I don't think that it is a cause for war (traditionally speaking), but it is a violation of sovereignty. I'm not sure what we can do about it at this point aside from defense and counter-offense.\n\nOn a classified system, the entire computer, and anything that touches it (be it media, monitor, printer, or network) is also classified. There can be no instance of one window being classified and the other not: they are both classified at the same level regardless of content.\n\nYou can have an unclassified system running right next to a classified one, but they cannot interact with each other at all."}

{"text":"Steam forums back online after security breach\n\nSteam's forums are back online after a November 6 attack potentially exposed users' private information stored in the company's database.\n\nThe news was confirmed on the forums, and if you have any questions about what to do next, the thread on the matter is very thorough.\n\nOn November 10, Valve boss Gabe Newell confirmed the news that user details and credit card information \"may have been compromised\" after the defacement of the forums and its user database.\n\n\"I am truly sorry this happened and I apologize for the inconvenience,\" Newell said in a statement at the time. \"Our Steam forums were defaced on the evening of Sunday, November 6. We began investigating and found that the intrusion goes beyond the Steam forums.\n\n\"We do not have evidence that encrypted credit card numbers or personally identifying information were taken by the intruders, or that the protection on credit card numbers or passwords was cracked. We are still investigating.\n\n\"We don't have evidence of credit card misuse at this time. Nonetheless you should watch your credit card activity and statements closely.\"\n\nSteam forum users are required to go through a password reset process now that the system is back online, but Newell has also urged general Steam users to re-secure their accounts \u2013 especially if you use the same password.\n\n\"We do not have evidence that encrypted credit card numbers or personally identifying information were taken by the intruders, or that the protection on credit card numbers or passwords was cracked. We are still investigating,\" Newell wrote. \"We don't have evidence of credit card misuse at this time. Nonetheless you should watch your credit card activity and statements closely.\"\n\nAlso, he said only a few forum accounts have been known to be compromised, but NO STEAM ACCOUNTS:@8, i'm not butt hurt because it's just a forum (where i don't sit) and there is still no evidence \"that encrypted credit card numbers or personally identifying information were taken by the intruders\". (c)\n\nbut still, blocking my card is the best solution here for the future if there will be confirmation.\n\n\"Our Steam forums were defaced on the evening of Sunday, November 6. We began investigating and found that the intrusion goes beyond the Steam forums.\n\n\"We learned that intruders obtained access to a Steam database in addition to the forums.\"\n\nI hope this group dont intend to be the new lulzsec, then again i really dont recall ever hearing about lulzsec being brought to justice, just some news about one member getting arrested followed by rumours that it was the wrong guy. So Why not?\n\nMaybe more means should be put towards actually catching these hackers then protecting systems against them, lets face it, they'll always find a way in, maybe the fear of actually being caught might make them think twice about doing it in the first place.\n\nYeah, well. At least if Steam goes down, which it didn't, we would still be able to surf the web, etc. It's stupid that if PSN or XBL goes down, you're pretty much SOL for anything online, gaming or not.\n\n@21\nYeah but theres clearly an issue to when it comes to tracking hackers down, if bank robbers got away with their crimes as easily as hackers did, there wouldnt be any banks left. I mean, i dont really follow these things, but by the looks of it hacking into a company and stealing info is practically a perfect crime, makes me wonder what other type of serious illegal stuff goes down on the internet, right under law enforcements noses without them being able to do anything about it.\n\nSome of you are total tits \u2013 really. This isnt about PC v Console! Both have had their fair share of issues and no matter how safe you make something, a determined hacker will get in some how \u2013 nothing is totally fool proof.\n\nGabe is merely stating that as of now, there is no evidence of credit card details being hacked but to be safe, check!\n\nThere's clearly a group of arse-holes out there who are set on just screwing over anything to do with the games industry by hacking official websites and networks.\n\nAnd if they are caught, they should be FORCED to play on the Gizmondo!\n\n1. At least Gabe and Valve are being completely honest and saying everything they know so far and rather swiftly.\n2. If they did gain any Steam account passwords Steam Guard (if you have it activated) should keep you safe.\n3. Geki, fuck you troll.\n\nI don't understand y everyone always shit their pants when something like happens. Don't ur credit cards have any damn protection?? If anyone tries to use my credit card outside of where I usually use it, it gets blocked. And these shitbird hackers don't even do it for the money most of the time, they just wanna troll the world like a buncha little douche bags.\n\nThis makes me wonder why Steam Guard isn't fully implemented yet. I'm not talking about the email you get when trying to sign in from a new PC, i'm talking about the integration with the 2nd generation i7 CPU's. Why haven't it been done yet? It is tech that has been used for a long time, so it is not like they have to invent the wheel.\n\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, but the preventitive effect only goes so far. It means that most of the cowards stay out of it, and the rest are that more determined.\n\nWhen people talk about ramping up efforts on a special sort of crime, they're usually running for office, and the measures they implement do little to keep anyone safe. They just hand society a little more vengeance.\n\nThe best way to avoid this sort of thing is always going to be a network that sees these things coming. I'm seriously disappointed that Steam wasn't more secure.\n\n@30\nNo more swiftly then others. When did this happen? Last Sunday? Still took them 5 days to say that CC details may have been taken, and they left the service open for business in between time. Not exactly taking every precaution there, are they.\n\n@43\nSure it can. They know the hackers got access to the DB, but they don't know which, if any tables were taken from the DB, so therefore, they had access to everything, but Valve doesn't know what was taken from it. Sorta like, your in a store, you have access to everything, you steal something, the owner of the store know you took something, but he doesn't know what exactly.\n\nThe password and creditcard information is encrypted, so yes, you can have acces to that database and copy the info. But no, that does not mean you can actually read any of that information.\nThat's why you encrypt things."}

{"text":"Are Your Keystrokes Being Recorded?\n\nThe increasing use of keyloggers on our cyber front is a concern worth addressing before significant damages can occur. Plain and simple, keylogger software and hardware track the succession of keys struck on a keyboard. Ultimately, this information is recorded to monitor computer activity when the owner is not the only user. This can be accomplished without the knowledge of said user, as the captured data is stored inconspicuously within the computer's hard drive where only the installer of the keylogging device would be aware.\n\nOn its face, the collection of confidential information (without consent) can be viewed negatively, but there are cases where keylogger use is more acceptable. For instance, it may be important for businesses to monitor keywords that could reveal potentially harmful information to their financial wellbeing, if delivered to the wrong hands. Additionally, parents often feel a duty to monitor their children's online activities with the purpose of maintaining their safety. These cases are just a few of the ways keylogging devices can be used in a more or less appropriate manner. Yet even in these circumstances there lies a fine line between preventative monitoring and blatant intrusion of personal information.\n\nBasic keylogger hardware can be directly installed on the keyboard cable and attaches to the input often found at the rear of the CPU. However, this hardware exists in many forms and is even employed in attempts to acquire financial information from ATM machine users. Keyboard overlays, which are often utilized in ATM skimming operations, provide another example of keylogging hardware. In these cyber schemes, overlays are placed directly on top of the actual PIN console and are created to resemble an authentic keypad. Another device is used to record the physical debit\/ATM card info and with that information the fraudster can compromise your financial security.\n\nAlthough legal, both software and hardware created with the purpose of recording keystrokes are available to the general public and thus, corrupt operators. Exploitation of keylogging programs is commonly perpetrated through use of the internet and victimized email accounts.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the data acquired through use of keylogger software is most readily installed and stored on the monitored CPU. However, experienced cyber fraudsters can infect foreign computers with spyware designed to obtain keystroke logs. Remote access software can be developed in the form of a Trojan (horse), which is a malicious program that allows a hacker access to a target computer system. The cyber fraudster will then be able to access your keystrokes (and much more) once this seemingly benign software is downloaded onto the objective unit.\n\nKeep in mind that remote access software is not only characteristic of malicious attacks, but is indeed available with the purchase of select keylogging programs that are legal. It should also be noted that there are other advanced forms of keyloggers available that employ acoustic, optical, and electromagnetic technologies to obtain data. However, these types are not used in great frequency as of this date.\n\nThe mere existence of keyloggers has created another cyber-related issue regarding our moral responsibility. Most are under the general understanding that infecting foreign computers with keyloggers is not acceptable. But where should we stand on installing keylogger devices and software in our own or business computers? If the user is aware that his\/her keystrokes are being logged many would agree that this use is acceptable. However this is not always the case. Nevertheless, it is ultimately up to you to decide how to utilize information obtained through keystroke logging."}
{"text":"7527 article, we take a forward-looking approach to the issue of active defense in cyberspace. Active defense typically occurs in the following way: the victim of a cyber attack detects an intrusion, identifies the source of the attack, and sends the data back at the attacker with the goal of interrupting the attack, thereby mitigating the harm to the victim's system. Building on our earlier work that active defense is socially optimal when accurate technology exists and civil litigation, criminal prosecution, and purely defensive strategies would be ineffective or impractical, we now discuss the domestic and international law implications of permitting active defense and offer recommendations for who should be responsible for active defense and under what circumstances. We recommend further improvement of the current technology available for active defense in order to ensure that any cyber counterstrikes have a strong chance of hitting the attacker. We stress the importance of any active defense regime being compatible with notions of self-defense under international humanitarian law and domestic law, though we reject the common conclusion that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act could be read broadly to prohibit any sort of activity on the Internet that might cause harm to another computer owned and operated by a private citizen. We also discuss the implications of permitting active defense by private firms and conclude that there may be too many potential harms to permit private firms to engage in active defense in the absence of controlling government oversight. However, the need for a more centralized response to cyber attacks raises the question of whether a government entity should be responsible for conducting cyber counterstrikes, and if so, what legal considerations would arise in the event of government-controlled active defense. Additionally, we examine the sort of controls that might be put in place to ensure the protection of oblivious third parties whose compromised computers might be inadvertently harmed by a cyberattack victim's choice to employ active defense."}

{"text":"Attackers behind espionage software that infected Iranian computers targeted hard-to-exploit weaknesses in a cryptographic algorithm, a feat that allowed them to counterfeit a Microsoft digital credential, a member of the company's security team said.\n\nDetails of the \"cryptographic collision attack,\" which came in a blog post published Monday afternoon, are the latest testament to the skill and sophistication that went into engineering the Flame malware. While theoretical, collision exploits in real-world attacks are virtually unheard of. As a 2008 attack on the MD5 cryptographic algorithm demonstrated, collision attacks require huge amounts of computing power, even when exploiting decades-old hashing functions. To pull it off, researchers had to wield the power of 200 PlayStation 3 gaming consoles.\n\nCryptographic algorithms are used to transform words, documents, or computer files into ciphertext that can never be converted back to their original form. These hash functions are used to digitally sign e-mails, ensure documents haven't been tampered with, and verify that software and software updates available online originated with a particular person or group. The integrity of the entire system relies on each unique piece of plaintext generating a unique string of ciphertext. The ability for someone to find a collision, in which two different plaintext sources generate the same ciphertext, completely undermines the system, since it relies on the plaintext remaining secret and unique."}

Still waiting for word from Sony.\n\nUpdate #2: Shane Bettenhausen has stated emphatically that the hack threat is a lie. He's told everybody to go buy Papo & Yo rather than be worried.\n\nUpdate #3: Official word from Sony: \"We've confirmed that the recent claim that PlayStation Network was illegally hacked and that customer passwords and email addresses were accessed is completely false.\"]\n\nUh oh. It would seem that Anonymous is not quite done with Sony yet, announcing today that the PlayStation Network has yet again been infiltrated and its ten million accounts are at risk. The group boasts of a 50GB database of usernames and passwords.\n\nWhether real or not, incidents like this usually indicate a good time to update your details just to be as careful as you can. Folks are claiming the announcement (or rather, the hack being announced) is fake. Best to be safe than sorry, of course.\n\nAt the moment, the official PSN site says it's down for maintenance when attempting to log in.\n\nLike every other site on the planet, we've contacted Sony for more details. With a lot of the company at gamescom, who knows how long it'll take to get a response? We'll keep you in the loop regardless!\n\nWhen I read the title, I unwittingly blurted \"Oh my god...\" in a Togos. Why the hell would anyone get off to this? I guarantee there will be \"HAHAHA, serves Sony right for *stupid reason*\" comments in this post, too.\n\nI thought it was pretty much a given by now that nobody trusts Sony with any important information anyway.\n\nWell, it's Anonymous. 'They' can claim anything, because there is no 'they'. I mean, 'Anonymous' is anywhere between 1 and 6.9 billion people, all of whom are entirely anonymous. Anybody can claim they have done absolutely anything under the name 'Anonymous'.\n\nSo, they probably have hacked PSN. And they probably haven't. Someone or someones, who has(have) decided to call themselves Anonymous, has almost certainly, at some point, nicked a load of info off PSN. But there is no 'group' that's done it, nor can 'Anonymous' do anything with any infomation they have obtained. That would imply organistation, a hierarchy and claiming responsibility, none of which is compatible with anonymity.\n\n@djnealb & Andreas Neuhalfen\nThey're anonymous. There can't be any reason or organisation behind anything they do. If there was then they couldn't be anonymous. A complete lack of rationale and responsibility is inherent in the movement.\n\nUgh. Ya know, part of what's good about the Anon ideal is that they're an unregulated group of random individuals on the internet. There's no structure, there's no order, there's no leaders, there's on agenda. They do what they do. And when it comes to grey hat stuff like tracking down pedophiles who post on 4Chan and shutting down the NYPD in retaliation for police brutality, it's fucking awesome and I'm glad groups like that exist out there.\n\nWhen they go around attacking Sony for removing half assed Linux support from their console in order to make sure they can actually afford to continue supporting that console in the future, it's fucking childish and stupid. All so they can rally around Geohot, some kid on the internet who wasn't hugged enough as a child and spends his days fucking with other people's money because he hasn't nothing better to do with his life.\n\nGlad this is a fake, anyway. Hopefully we can all go back to watching Sony's showing at Gamescom and do what all real gamers should be doing: ENJOYING FUCKING VIDEO GAMES.\n\nEh, either way, change your passwords often and be smart about what you pick.

{"text":"Monday, November 2, 2009\nat\n3:39 PM ET\n\nPosted by Eric Davis, Head of Anti-Malvertising\n\nLast week I joined several industry experts to speak at a cyber security panel on Capitol Hill organized by Congresswoman Yvette Clarke and sponsored by the Committee on Homeland Security. The conversation focused on things everyday Internet users can do to help protect their computers and stay safe online. Given that we just wrapped up our observation of National Cyber Security Awareness Month, I thought I'd share some of the key recommendations from the panel:\n\nWhat are the most important things we all need to do to protect our computers and mobile devices? You should have the same expectations when using the Internet as you would when exploring a city: you don't give your credit card to the person selling watches on the street just because you recognize the brand, you don't let your kids wander around by themselves and you don't give personal information unless you know who's getting it. If an offer is \"urgent\" or seems too good to be true, take a step back and research the offer. Add a password to your mobile phone, and browse cautiously on open WiFi networks as you would when using a computer.\n\nWhat are the most common misconceptions about cyber security? Many dangerous websites are not designed to be dangerous. In fact, most of the sites that serve malware (malicious software) are innocent sites that have been compromised in one way or another. Your computer isn't necessarily safe just because you're avoiding sites that contain adult content or pirated software. Use reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs, and keep your computer operating system and applications updated with the latest software versions.\n\nHow do I know if my computer or network has been compromised? First, disconnect it from the Internet. Take note of any slowness, and if you're not sure how to proceed, get someone with technical expertise to check your network logs for high traffic appearing during times when you're not using the computer. When in doubt, contact a computer support expert.\n\nAs President Obama recently stated, cyber security is a shared responsibility. At Google, we recognize how important awareness and education are because many online security threats can only be avoided if we work together.\n\nWe spent the month of October exploring cyber security and talking about how to use Google products in a more secure manner. If you haven't seen them already, take a look at the posts we've released over the last month:"}
{"text":"ZeuS Trojan Botnet Learns a New Trick: Peer-to-Peer\n\nIn what seems to be the next evolution of malware, the Zeusbot\/SpyEye Trojan network has been discovered in the wild that doesn't rely on a centralized command-and-control server\u2014instead, the new variants use a peer-to-peer architecture to get the job done.\n\nAccording an article in The Register, security researchers at Symantec have dissected the new code and discovered that the virus makers have sought to jettison the weakness of requiring a home-base for something that BitTorrent users have known for a long time: being decentralized makes it harder to shut you down.\n\nNow cybercrooks have built functionality into Zeusbot\/SpyEye that allows instructions to be distributed via P2P techniques as well, eliminating the need for C&C servers. Compromised systems are now capable of downloading commands, configuration files, and executables from other bots, a write-up by security researchers at Symantec explains.\n\n\"Previously, every compromised computer was a peer in the botnet and the configuration file (containing the URL of the C&C server) was distributed from one peer to another,\" Symantec researcher Andrea Lelli explains. \"This way, even if the C&C server was taken down, the botnet was still able to contact other peers to receive configuration files with URLs of new C&C servers.\"\n\nResearchers also discovered that instead of forming long-lastingTCPdirect connections, the malware is working harder on flying under the radar by sending out packets that it doesn't expect replies to with UDP. This makes the malware just a little bit harder to track and allows it to piggyback signals that pretend to be part of regular operations (such as DNS and other quick-burst communication.)\n\nThe peer-to-peer aspect appears to be exchanged via HTTP using an open source minimal Web server called nGinx. This allows the bots to discover and contact each other as if they were Web servers. Once again, meaning that the communication between the bots could be disguised better as usual computer use (since most users use the Web a great deal.)\n\nAlso, the nGinx server permits each bot in the entire net to handle and respond to HTTP requests and as a result any given bot in botnet can handle command-and-control messages. Web servers in botnets aren't very new; in fact, the Waledac\/Kelihos botnet uses Web servers to communicate\u2014the same botnet obliterated by a Microsoft operation in late 2011.\n\nLittle information was released by the write-up about how the command-and-control has been decentralized. It would make sense that the virus maker would key the botnet to their commands in some fashion and would designate a single bot for a short time as command-and-control in order to tell the botnet what to do and could turn that functionality on and off via contact.\n\nZeuS and such are often used as Trojans to spy on users as they use their computers and collect sensitive information such as passwords, banking information, etc. and now that information can be carefully doled out through the botnet between different bots. This both makes it harder to kill the entire botnet\u2014whereas before only one C&C server needed to go down\u2014and it makes it harder to find the criminals using the net because they could connect to any given bot in the network and have them siphon their ill-gotten goods to any particular node for exfiltration.\n\nAs a botnet source that used to sell time for thousands of dollars a whack, ZeuS probably just made itself even more valuable.\n\nAlthough, as previously noted, the code for this net has been leaked publicly, which means anyone with the know-how can tinker with it and set a new one up"}

When Internet access is essentially free and\nUnix is free and phone calls are essentially free and pennies on the\nminute, not dollars on the minute, why do you need to steal a phone call\nwhen it's free? Why do you need to break into a university to read man\n(manual) pages on Unix when you can download free security guides\nonline?\nYou had to work so hard to learn something, and once you learned it you\nfelt like it was yours. You made it yours by discovering it and figuring\nit out and sharing it with your friends. But now it's basically just\nhanded to you on a Google search page so that motivation is just\ndifferent now. Now it's not a question of figuring out how the SS7 phone\nswitching network works. You can download 50 documents that tell you how\nit works. It's more about now the information is basically free what do\nyou do with the information? How do you use it? Before it was about the\nquest for information; just getting your hands on the information was a\nvictory.\nAs soon as people started making money on the Net...during the dot-com\nboom, that's when you could see the impact. Everybody needed somebody\nwith Internet skills. And at that time it was hackers and early\nadopters. So all the early adopters could go out and get paid for their\nhobbies. That changed the nature of it too. It became a job as opposed\nto a hobby. When the criminals finally caught on that there was some\nreal money with low risk and potential high reward...once nation states\nand organized crime groups got involved, that was the end of the age of\ninnocence. It happened really quickly; 10 years or so. It used to be\nthat you could probably defend against the bored college student and a\ncouple of his buddies and you could do some defensive maneuvers and\nwatch your log and know when somebody is poking around (your network)\nand have a pretty good handle on things.\nBut the amount of noise and the amount of scanning and the amount of\nresources that people can put against you now, its kind of...(laughs) I\nused to always say that large governments, military, and an EDS or a\nMicrosoft, they've got the in-house talent to defend themselves and the\nbudget to do it if they have to. But the SMBs, the small and medium\nbusinesses, they don't have the talent or the budget or the experience,\nso those poor companies are at a disadvantage in this kind of world...\nThe technology hasn't matured to where you just plug it in and it works.\nYou still need a certain amount of high-end talent if you want to be\nsecure. So we're not at the point where you buy a car and you've got the\nair bag. We're not there yet. Every year the bar keeps getting raised\nand it's a little bit harder to break in. But that just means that the\nbetter-funded organized crime groups and governments could potentially\nbe the last ones left standing. And when the attacks get so\nsophisticated and so subtle your average sec guy is not going to\nnecessarily have the computer skills to protect against it.\n[...]\n________________________________________\nDid a friend send you this?

{"text":"Computer Keyboard Hacking\n\nOct 22, 2008 by John Messina\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Swiss researchers from the Security and Cryptography Laboratory have demonstrated different ways of eavesdropping on wired keyboards from at least 11 different models. The keyboards range from the latest ones to the ones used in 2001. Test show that all these keyboards were vulnerable to at least four of their attacks.\n\nThe researchers found that most modern keyboards generate electromagnetic emanations that can be used to decipher the keystrokes remotely. They used some basic instruments to \"sniff\" these electromagnetic emissions, which eventually helped them to decipher the keystrokes typed.\n\nBy using a wireless aerial, keystrokes were sniffed from a computer located a meter away. Once the data is sniffed, it is converted into decipherable text with software developed by Vuagnoux.\n\nAnother test revealed that keystrokes, from a computer in an adjacent room 20 to 30 feet away, could be deciphered by using a larger antenna.\n\nIt has been conclude that wired computer keyboards, sold in stores, generate compromising emanations that make it not safe to transmit sensitive information.\n\nElectromagnetic eavesdropping dates back to as early as the mid 1980s, if not earlier. But Researchers say many of today\u00b4s keyboards have been adapted to prevent those attacks from working. Current research now shows that even these keyboards are vulnerable to electromagnetic sniffing.\n\nIt can be seen that such attacks would be limited due to electromagnetic interference from other electrical devices. The other thing that makes the attack unfeasible is the amount of sophisticated equipment required. Given all the fuss and expense, why not just use a more conventional method.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nIt seems like the ordinary is no longer acceptable when it comes to the ordinary things we attach to our computers these days.

{"text":"The level of cybersecurity in the U.K. is so shallow it presents clear risk to national security -- and could take as long as 20 years to fix. That's the warning from a new study by the U.K. national spending watchdog The National Audit Office (NAO).\n\nThreats to cybersecurity are both \"persistent\" and \"continually evolving,\" says the study, with the annual cost of cyber crime to the U.K. currently estimated to be between \u00a327 billion and \u00a342 billion ($18 billion and $28 billion). As a result, \"Business, government and the public must therefore be constantly alert to the level of risk if they are to succeed in detecting and resisting the threat of cyber attack.\" One report quoted in the study said the U.K. suffered 44 million cyber attacks in 2011 alone.\n\nReports\n\nThe report praised the government's decision two years ago to commit an extra \u00a3650 million ($1.01 billion) to beef up cyber defenses, with the money going mainly to the military and security agencies. However, that might only be the start of a longer journey to fuller security. The extra funding is scheduled to run out in 2015. To put the amount spent on security into context, the study says the U.K.'s Internet economy is over \u00a3120 billion ($187 billion).\n\nThe money is part of an initiative called the U.K.'s Cyber Security Strategy, which has detailed the risks of the U.K.'s growing reliance on cyberspace and lists a group as diverse as criminals, terrorists, foreign intelligence services, foreign militaries and politically motivated \"hacktivists\" as potential enemies who might choose to attack the nation via the Web or other electronic means.\n\nSo far the money has been put to effective use, says the study, citing the creation of the U.K. equivalent to the FBI, the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA), which has clawed back more than 2.3 million items of compromised financial account holder card payment details in the U.K. and internationally since 2011. This prevented potential economic loss of over \u00a3500 million ($778 million). In the last 12 months alone the British public has come forward to report over 46,000 reports of cyber crime, amounting to \u00a3292 million ($455 million) in attempted fraud, it said.\n\nThe challenge, say the report's authors, is the next stage -- of where the country needs to commit resources going forward. It identifies six action items that need funding: encourage the computer industry to protect and promote itself and U.K. companies; address the nation's current and future ICT and cybersecurity skills gap; increase awareness so that people are not the weakest link; tackle cyber crime and enforce the law; get government to be more agile and joined-up; and demonstrate value for money.\n\nBut a bigger issue that could hobble the entire program is lack of homegrown IT security nous. The number of IT and cybersecurity professionals in the U.K. has not increased in line with the growth of the Internet, the report states, quoting experts that it could take \"up to 20 years to address the skills gap.\" Interestingly, that doesn't mean just more Brit white hat hackers; a number of skills need to be amplified, it believes. \"The skills the U.K. needs to design and implement cybersecurity policy are not only technical, there is also a need for psychologists; law enforcers; corporate strategists and risk managers. Other professionals such as lawyers and accountants also need to understand cybersecurity in order to assess, manage and mitigate the business risk of cyber threats,\" says the study.\n\nIt also might mean some education at the consumer level. The study says up to 21% of U.K. Internet users do not think they have sufficient skills to protect their personal data, although the country's semi-secret communications defense body, GCHQ, has estimated that 80% of cyber attacks could be prevented through simple computer and network \"hygiene,\" such as using strong passwords. Unfortunately, in 2012 the top three passwords in the U.K. were \"password,\" \"123456\" and \"12345678.\""}

The purpose of using a dating site is presumably to form new relationships, and to that end you might be tempted to give away a little more information than you otherwise would - especially if you were talking to a piece of software designed to wheedle personal details from you.\n\nCyberLover could prove to be the vanguard of a new form of malware.

It is a place where hackers and IT professionals meet to learn about computing security.\n\nHacking has been in the news lately with groups like Lulzsec and Anonymous attacking and taking down major websites in an effort to stop what they call \"corruption.\"\n\nNot all hackers are out to destroy. Christopher Payne is one of the founders of GRRCON. His goal is to get like-minded people together to learn something he calls \"ethical\" hacking.\n\nEthical hacking is a concept where you test systems for vulnerabilities,\" Payne explains, \"and you find problems before people with unethical intentions do.\"\n\nThere is good money being a hacker that looks for holes in security. Payne says, \"Companies all over the world will hire hackers to break into their system and tell them how they did it so they can fix it.\"\n\nPayne says there is a stereotype of computer hackers, \"If you ask the average person it is probably some overweight nerd in his mother's basement beating on his computer till 3 a.m.\" Payne explains, \"that's kind of accurate.\n\nThere is a reason why some hackers don't see the light of day, and that is because to find loopholes requires a lot of time searching and testing. It can be tedious work.\n\nThe conference isn't just dedicated to computer hacking. There is also a section dedicated to lock picking, an activity that hackers have embraced.

{"text":"NetworkedBlogs\n\nFORGET pickpockets or thieves. The biggest threat to your smartphone now is kidnappers cyber \"kidnappers\" that is, with their Ransomware.\n\nAs the name suggests, ransomware is a malware (malicious software) that will keep your phone or computer a prisoner until you pay a ransom. Only when the specified amount of money is paid will you be able to \"free\" your device and access data or information.\n\nAlthough it is not new ransomware is said to originate from Russia in 2005 and has been attacking many computers worldwide since the Symantec Corp Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR) Volume 18 revealed that ransomware is emerging as the malware of choice because of its high profitability for attackers.\n\nLuckily, says Symantec Malaysia's senior technical consultant David Rajoo, to his knowledge, no cases have been reported here yet.\n\n\"However, as the worldwide web has no boundaries and with increasing broadband penetration and as more users are accessing the Internet, Malaysia is certainly exposed to the Ransomware threats,\" he says.\n\nInfected machines display messages which demand payment in order to restore functionality. \u2013 David Rajoo\n\nRajoo points out that awareness is key to combat ransomware threat.\n\nAs the report highlights, attackers are using deceptive links and poisoned websites to infect unsuspecting users with malicious software and lock their machines.\n\n\"The attackers, many of them cybercriminal organisations, then hold users' machines for ransom. Infected machines display messages which demand payment in order to restore functionality,\" he tells.\n\nRecent attacks have also displayed images that impersonate law enforcement.\n\nConsumers on the Android platform are most vulnerable to ransomware and mobile threats, says the report.\n\nLast year, mobile malware increased by 58%, and 32% of all mobile threats attempted to steal information, such as e-mail addresses and phone numbers.\n\nAlthough Android has fewer vulnerabilities, its threats are higher than any other mobile operating system. Its open platform and the multiple distribution methods available to distribute malicious apps make it the go-to platform for attackers, adds the report.\n\nWith malware growing sophisticated every day, Rajoo adds, a mix of intelligence-based technologies can provide optimal security to stop new and unknown malware.\n\nTo avoid getting infected, ensure the device's software and anti-virus definitions are up to date, and avoid suspicious sites, Rajoo advises.\n\n\"We also advise users to use more than antivirus for protection. We recommend using advanced reputation security which provides layered defence. Use more than just Antivirus use a full functionality solution which includes heuristics, reputation-based, behaviour-based and other technologies,\" he says, stressing that a key strategy is to fend off threats before they infiltrate your computer system.\n\nSymantec Malaysia's Systems Engineering director Nigel Tan agrees that stopping the threat at the gate is important as cyber criminals continue to devise new ways to steal information from organisations of all sizes.\n\nStaying ahead of attacks\n\n\"The sophistication of attacks coupled with today's information technology complexities require organisations in Malaysia and globally to remain proactive and use \"defence in depth\" security measures to stay ahead of attacks,\" he added.\n\nAccording to the annual ISTR which analyses the year in global threat activity, Malaysia was ranked 35th on its global Internet security threat profile in 2012.\n\nAs it highlights, there was a 42% surge last year in targeted attacks globally compared with the prior year.\n\nThese targeted cyberespionage attacks, designed to steal intellectual property, are increasingly hitting the manufacturing sector as well as small businesses, which are the target of 31% of these attacks.\n\nSmall businesses are attractive targets themselves and a way in to ultimately reach larger companies via \"watering hole\" techniques.\n\nIn a watering hole attack scenario, attackers compromise a carefully selected website by inserting an exploit resulting in malware infection. Through the compromised website, the attackers will target victims who visit the compromised site and take advantage of their software vulnerabilities to drop malware that will allow them to access sensitive data and take control of the vulnerable system.\n\nAs Symantec alerts, 61% of malicious websites are actually legitimate websites that have been compromised and infected with malicious code.\n\nBusiness, technology and shopping websites were among the top five types of websites hosting infections. The shift of focus from government websites indicates an increase in attacks targeting the supply chain cybercriminals find these contractors and subcontractors susceptible to attacks and they are often in possession of valuable intellectual property.\n\nThe attack uses the security weaknesses in the supply chain specifically the small businesses to gain access into larger and more secured companies, adds Symantec.\n\nCase in point is that those in sales became the most commonly targeted victims last year.\n\nAnother growing source of infections on websites is malvertisements this is when criminals buy advertising space on legitimate websites and use it to hide their attack code.\n\nTan urges organisations to continue to take proactive initiatives to secure and manage critical information from a variety of security risks, especially targeted attacks in the manufacturing and small business sectors, mobile malware, and phishing threats cultureVish Iyer: 'There is no advantage in having 20 or 30 years of experience unless you are \u2026very merit-driven and work-driven'.\n\n\"For an insurance company, it could mean enabling an agent to get quotations and conduct transactions on his or her mobile.\" For an airline, pilots no longer carry huge bags with heavy operating manuals. \"We put that on an iPad,\" he adds.\n\nFew would believe the president for Asia Pacific at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has neither training in IT nor a background in engineering. He learns by doing.\n\nBorn and raised in Kolkata around the time when India's first computer arrived, Iyer graduated from St Xavier's College, one of the city's best-known educational institutions with a major in taxation and economics.\n\nNow the head of the largest service provider in the Asia-Pacific region based in Singapore, he manages 10,000 employees in 13 countries including Australia, Japan, China and South Korea.\n\nThe 45-year-old Indian company, whose clients include Microsoft and ING Group, is the provider of IT services and business solutions, with a turnover exceeding $12 billion and market capitalization of $45 billion on the Bombay Stock Exchange.\n\nIt is part of the Tata group, India's largest conglomerate in seven sectors including communications, engineering and energy, with a revenue of more than $100 billion in the fiscal year 2011-12.\n\nAs a certified accountant, Iyer moved on from the financial field to other areas including human resources, marketing, strategy, mergers and acquisition. \"I have been a chief financial officer many times,\" he tells China Daily Asia Weekly at the TCS Hong Kong office.\n\nBut that didn't stop him from venturing into new fields after three and a half decades. Midway through his career, he moved into a new-born industry in India.\n\nHis rationale is: \"What matters is how you put your basic training to use and how you quickly learn from the surroundings. You can do anything as long as you have a will to do it, and you are determined to work hard enough.\"\n\nHe spent a decade at IBM, where he was director of corporate development. IT has since become his longest stint.\n\nHe has witnessed the birth of the industry along with the ups and downs. \"The IT industry is very fascinating. Every two to three years are completely different. In that sense, everybody got to continuously learn,\" he says.\n\nIn the IT world, experience doesn't necessarily give you an edge over the younger generation. Two-thirds of the company's workforce has about three years of experience and the average age of a TCS employee is just 28.\n\n\"There is no advantage (in) having 20 or 30 years of experience unless you are \u2026 very merit-driven and work-driven,\" Iyer says.\n\n\"This is the industry across the world (where) everything looks the same. There is no different standard in the US or Japan. Once you are inside IT, it is the same. It talks the same language and (has the same) quality level.\"\n\nThe capability to locate young talent matters for the industry. To Iyer, the Chinese mainland not only has a staggering domestic market but also vast trained manpower resources.\n\nTCS is among the first Indian companies to enter the Chinese mainland as the first wholly-owned foreign enterprise. The IT consultancy commenced its operations in Shanghai in 2002, then established a development center in Hangzhou in Zhejiang province in October of the same year. Its banking products are used by Bank of China in more than 40 provinces.\n\nIyer sees the potential to substantially increase China's TCS workforce from its current number of 3,000 people, as the company's sales growth in China outpaces that in the Americas. TCS now has relations with 20 colleges in China.\n\n\"Our business is all about people,\" he says. \"At the end of the day, we need to find out where are these talents available for serving our customers. China is very important from that point of view \u2014 as a pool of talent. It's equally important for the size of the economy, too.\"\n\n\"We are very bullish about China,\" he said in a previous interview. \"Its full potential has not yet been harnessed \u2026 We're looking to leverage its position as an innovation center and a hub for the Northeast Asia region.\"\n\nTCS has started to provide a ground-breaking cloud-based service that enables smaller banks and credit unions to establish their own Internet, mobile and ATM facilities by paying a monthly fee. \"A village bank need not have an IT department, but the same technology that empowers a (central bank) is now available to small and medium enterprises.\"\n\nThe TCS pioneer project has found a home in the world's second largest economy. iCity or the Intelligent City, utilizes smart technologies and collective intelligence to improve a city's livability and sustainability.\n\nThese cities will be built on cloud infrastructure that makes them easy to run. Every citizen will own a personalized information page for health records and blood pressure measurements and even get health alerts and doctors' advice.\n\nImagine buildings that glean energy from the sun and rain, reducing energy consumption, and embedded software in cars and traffic poles that automatically monitor local traffic. At the same time, healthcare and consumer services are dispensed to citizens at home, saving time, cost and valuable resources.\n\nAn iCity project in southern China's port city of Guangzhou is slated for a soft launch later this year. More blueprints are on majors' drawing boards in first- and second-tier Chinese cities, including Tianjin, Ningbo and Chengdu.\n\n\"The Indian IT industry over the last 20 years has done exceedingly well,\" Iyer says. \"Works of best quality are from this industry. There (has been) a lot of proud achievements \u2014 so it's an exciting place to be in.\"\n\nBut when asked about the most exciting moment in his life, the president's answer has surprisingly nothing to do with his career. \"The day when my daughter was born, and when I was holding her in my hands,\" he says, with a gentle smile.\n\n\"Lots of people talk about work-life balance. I think each person has to find that balance himself \u2026 Family influence is a strong support for the profession I pursue, so there are no conflicts or contradiction.\"\n\nLooking back, Iyer has been with his two children \u2014 his 23-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son \u2014 through every important step of their life. \"I (accompany) them through every exam, drop them off and pick them up after classes, and consult their teachers for college admissions. As long as you enjoy it, you'll find time for doing it,\" he adds.\n\nTechnology has been the savior for this family man with a hectic business schedule with long hours of frequent travel.\n\n\"I am on the road 50 or 60 percent of the time. Each month, I am outside my hometown for 20 days,\" he says. \"My children have grown up with me spending a lot of time at work. But this is a world of Facebook, email and Skype. That's what we do now,\" he says.\n\nWhat makes his day? Iyer answers professionally without a second of hesitation: \"To satisfy a customer in a meeting.\"\n\nThen comes the personal bit: \"Followed by a relaxing dinner with my wife.\"\n\nBy jennifer@chinadailyhk.com\n\nVish Iyer President of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Asia Pacific\n\nCareer Milestones: 2010: Becomes president of TCS Asia Pacific 2008: Serves as CFO of global business operations at TCS 2006: Takes up post as head of corporate strategy at TCS 1996: Becomes director of corporate development at IBM Global Services 1991: Joins Tata Elxsi as executive vice-president\n\nQUICK TAKES: Hobbies:\nPlaying golf.

Malaysia now has 30 billionaires, just three more from the 27 on the list last year.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported last year that Malaysia's millionaires almost doubled over the previous 18 months.\n\nCiting a report by international financial firm Credit Suisse Group, it said Malaysia added 19,000 new millionaires since early 2010, bringing the total to 39,000 as of October.\n\nThe WSJ report attributed the rise to the weakening US dollar and careful spending.\n\nDr Yeah said those who invested their money wisely had benefited the most.\n\n\"In a free market and capitalist economy like Malaysia, people who have capital can generate millions,\" he said, noting that many in the upper-income bracket had accumulated wealth past the million-ringgit mark.\n\nPersonal financial consultant Carol Yip said the rising cost of living had lessened the feeling of being rich.\n\n\"Today, even a small apartment can cost half a million,\" she said.\n\nShe said careful spending was not a factor for the increase in the numbers of millionaires.\n\n\"If we are spending less, we won't be seeing so many luxury cars on the road,\" she said.\n\nShe said the rise in millionaires was also due to property prices which have shot up exponentially, adding that the definition should not include the value of the house that one was living in.\n\n\"If you still have a million in hand after you convert the value of your other properties, investments and have paid of all your debts, then you are a millionaire,\" she added.\n\nFinancial adviser Fred Wong said making a million was not a problem these days as long as people were willing to work hard but being self-employed and investing wisely was the better route to riches.\n\nPETALING JAYA: Ganesh Kumar Bangah made his first million at the age of 23.\n\nThe secret, he said, was as simple as knowing what people needed and delivering it to them.\n\n\"I knew what I was good at, which was IT. I used that to come up with something of value to the world.\n\n\"I also worked hard and persevered until I reached the goals I had set for myself,\" said Ganesh, now 33 and the CEO of MOL Global Bhd, a company worth over RM1bil.\n\nYoung and rich: Ganesh (left) and Yap made their first million at the age of 23 and 26 respectively.\n\nHe said that even when he was only 15, he had been using his skills to make money, like repairing his teachers' computers for a fee.\n\nAt the age of 20, he started his own company, which made him a millionaire in three years.\n\n\"Be focused and set new goals for yourself to keep climbing higher. Real wealth is the satisfaction you get when you overcome a new challenge that brings rewards. Financial wealth should just be a by-product.\"\n\nFeng shui master and multi-millionaire Joey Yap said learning to make good use of time was a key ingredient to achieving financial success.\n\n\"In business, time is money, so make sure you use your time to acquire things of good value. Find out what your strengths are, work on your weaknesses and hone your talents,\" said Yap, 35, who made his first million at age 26 by selling his first feng shui home study course.\n\nHowever, having RM1mil does not necessarily make people feel rich, especially for those raising children in the city.\n\nCarol Leong, 57, a mother of three, said it costs more than the amount for an average family to live in the city and raise a child to adulthood.\n\n\"There are medical bills, tuition fees, various expenses and their education to pay for. For our family, it has definitely come up to more than RM1mil per child,\" she said.\n\nLeong, a lawyer, said she and her businessman husband had placed their money in various investments, which in the long run had helped pay for tertiary education overseas for their three children.\n\n\"I would advise young parents living in the city and who are just starting a family to invest to secure some income for the future,\" she added thatA high-rated Firefox extension with more than 7 million downloads secretly collects data about every website the open-source browser visits and combines it with uniquely traceable information tied to the user, an independent security researcher said.\n\nThe undisclosed behavior of the Ant Video Downloader and Player add-on takes place even when the Firefox private browsing mode is turned on or when users are availing themselves of anonymity services such as Tor. The add-on carries a rating of four out of five possible stars and gets an average of almost 7,000 downloads per day, according to official Mozilla statistics.\n\nThe revelations raise new questions about the safety of extensions offered on Mozilla's website. A spokeswoman for the open-source developer said the media player, like all public extensions not designated experimental, was vetted to make sure it meets a list of criteria. Chief among them is that add-ons \"must make it very clear to users what [privacy and security] risks they might encounter, and what they can do to protect themselves.\"\n\n\"We've looked into the Ant Video Player and found that it does send information about websites users visit in order to power its ranking feature displayed for each website, and also includes a unique identifier in this communication,\" the spokeswoman wrote in an email. \"While this does not violate our policies, we do require it to be disclosed in the privacy policy and the add-on's description. We have contacted the developer and asked them to correct this.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the add-on is available for download on Mozilla's site with no warning.\n\nMessages left through a submission form on Ant.com, where a stand-alone version of the software is hosted, weren't returned. Attempts to reach the developers through other channels weren't successful.\n\nThe stealth tracking came to the attention of Simon Newton while he was diagnosing problems with a web application he was in the middle of developing. When he fired up a packet sniffer, he discovered that information about every single HTTP request his PC made was being sent to a server at rpc.ant.com, which used an IP address owned by the Reality Check Network Corp. The data included the external website or internal server being accessed, the time, the browser details, and several persistent browser cookies that contained a Universally Unique Identifier.\n\nNewton quickly linked the behavior to the the Ant Video add-on installed on the PC. He said packets captured during a recent visit to El Reg looked like this:\n\nInterestingly, the unique identifier of Newton's PC didn't change even after he removed the add-on and reinstalled it. The only way he was able purge the tracking ID was to completely revert Firefox to its original settings and then reinstall the Ant Video extension.\n\n\",\" he wrote in a blog post published on May 10.Newton said he tried contacting the add-on's developers to find out if the snoop behavior is the result of a bug, but so far no one has responded to a personal message or his blog post.\n\nThe larger lesson here is that just because a Firefox add-on has been subjected to Mozilla's official vetting process there is no guarantee it doesn't do things that many users consider to be invasions of their privacy. With at least 5,000 add-ons hosted on its site, it wouldn't be shocking to find out that Ant Video isn't the only extension that comes with a few nasty surprises. \u00ae\n\nUpdate\n\nAs of late Thursday night California time, the Ant Video Downloader was no longer available on Mozilla's site.\n\n\"The page or file you requested wasn't found on our site,\" the page where the add-on had been located read. \"It's possible that you clicked a link that's out of date, or typed in the address incorrectly.\"\n\nThe IT gender pay gap is getting worse, according to results from the 2009 silicon.com Skills Survey.\n\nMore than a third (35 per cent) of female IT workers responding to this year's survey said they were on the bottom rung of the tech pay ladder, earning less than \u00a325k, compared to just under a third of women (32 per cent) last year. And only 14 per cent of male IT workers are in the lowest pay bracket this year, down from 20 per cent in 2008.\n\nA slightly larger proportion of women than men also take home the second lowest pay packet, of between \u00a325,001 to \u00a340k: 27.5 per cent of women versus 25.5 per cent of men. However when it comes to earnings of more than \u00a340,001, men consistently dominate \u2013 and in the highest pay brackets the proportion of men to women is more than double.\n\nImage credit: Natasha Lomas\/silicon.com\n\nNearly a quarter (23 per cent) of male respondents reported earning \u00a340,001 to \u00a355k this year, compared to less than a fifth (17.5 per cent) of female respondents; while 17 per cent of male respondents reported earning \u00a355,001 to \u00a370k, versus just 12.5 per cent of women. In the top two earnings brackets there is a significant hike in the proportion of men versus women: 15 per cent of male respondents reported earning \u00a370,001 to \u00a3110k this year, compared to just five per cent of women; while 5.5 per cent of men claimed to pocket \u00a3110,001+, only 2.5 per cent of women did.\n\nWhen it comes to bonuses, while a larger proportion of female techies reported getting a bonus this year than male techies (42.5 per cent of women versus 35 per cent of men) \u2013 a change on last year when the sexes were equally likely to get extra cash \u2013 men tended to take home bigger bonuses than women.\n\nThe majority of female bonuses this year fall in the less-than-\u00a35k category: 65 per cent of female respondents, versus 47 per cent of men.\n\nFor bigger bonuses men were the clear winners: no female IT workers responding to the survey reported receiving a bonus of more than \u00a320,001, yet 10 per cent of male respondents took home the biggest bucks \u2013 including one per cent that reported getting a bonus of more than \u00a3100k. And while 43 per cent of men reported a bonus of between \u00a35,001 and \u00a320k, only 35 per cent of women did so.\n\nIn April this year the government published the Equality Bill which includes measures to strengthen the law on pay equality in the public sector. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, women still earn on average 22 per cent less per hour than men \u2013 a marginal improvement on last year when the gap stood at 22.5 per cent.\n\nComments\n\n1. anonymous\n\nStatistics. All this proves is that the women spend more time filling in questionaires whilst the men ignore them as they are not very interested. I constantly see more and more females being promoted up the ladder to balance out but a lot are promoted above thier ability and then make a mess of things making it more difficult for women to shine in the future. Promotions should be on talent alone and no other reason and stats like these should be complied properly.\n\n2. anonymous\n\nWhile I don't necessarily agree with the previous poster, these stats prove nothing. We don't know the ages of the respondents, how many women choose to leave the profession early to do other things (leaving perhaps more in junior posts), or even if it was a statistically fair sample.\n\nFor example we have few female techies but several female ex techies in senior positions\n\nSo a good start a debate, but there is nothing here that can be relied upon to provide any real information.\n\n3. blogger123\n\nMost statistics are made up.\n\n4. NLondon\n\nLatest figures from the Office for National Statistics show women still earn on average 22 per cent less per hour than men.\n\nDespite Gartner projecting a 5.3 percent increase in IT spending in 2010 over 2009, and IT vendors reporting rosy earnings, venture capitalists have been moving away from investing as much in enterprise IT in the past several years. As The Wall Street Journal reports, IT represented 53 percent of VC deals in 2001 but it has plummeted to 33 percent in 2009.\n\nIt's not as if those VCs are holding their money. They're actively investing in health care, green tech, and other sectors\u2026\n\n\u2026like mobile.\n\nThe irony with mobile is that while it's siphoning away VC dollars from IT, it may actually be fueling enterprise IT spending. Mary Meeker suggests that with the mobile Web we're entering the fifth major technology cycle, eclipsing the desktop Internet era, an era of personal computers driven by enterprise IT.\n\nBut mobile is very much a heavy hitter in enterprise IT, even if it didn't start there.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, enterprise IT is rapidly co-opting mobile. It has to: employees are demanding that IT support their device preferences.\n\nHence, while companies may have been relatively quick to adopt the BlackBerry (\"Hey, I can keep my employees working 24\/7, constantly tethered to e-mail!\"), even the \"toy\" iPhone has won over the enterprise, and employees are already inventing arguments why the iPad should be next.\n\nWhy? It's the apps.\n\nE-mail was the initial killer app for mobile, but we've moved well beyond that. From Foursquare to mobile search to Facebook Mobile, the enterprise is increasingly running through consumer-esque applications that connect employees to business partners, fellow employees, and vendors of essential services.\n\nEven traditional IT increasingly will run on consumer-driven mobile technology. MeeGo, the amalgamation of Intel's Moblin and Nokia's Maemo mobile Linux initiatives, is making its way onto enterprise-friendly laptops. The same holds true for Google Android.\n\nIn other words, even as VCs shift their investments to mobile, their money is likely helping to drive enterprise IT. It's not a direct investment, to be sure, but no less effective. Enterprise IT is alive and well. It just looks more mobile now, and less tied to the desktop.\n\n(Credit: Dow Jones VentureSource)"}

If the botnet operators do find them, the IP addresses often are blacklisted quickly by reputation systems and are then useless for the attackers. Now, in one effort to get around these systems, some attackers are taking advantage of the lack of IPv4 space by either purchasing or renting blocks of IP space with good reputations that have been built up over the course of several years. A number of legitimate trading and auction sites appeared as the IPv4 space became scarcer, and the attackers have gotten involved as well, getting their hands on known good IP blocks and using them for C&C or hosting malware.\"\n\nI call BS. Hackers don't rent or buy IP addresses for botnets. The bots run on machines each of which has an IP address already. And when they do need IP addresses, they steal them: find an address assignment not currently routed on the Internet and forge papers they present to the ISP claiming to be the actual registrant.\n\nThere are a number of protections in place at ARIN and the other Internet Registries which do a reasonably good job preventing hackers from taking actual \"ownership\" of blocks of IP addresses.\n\nWhile there is such a thing as a \"legitimate trading and auction sites,\" there are also a lot of snake oil salesman out there right now claiming legitimacy. Here's a hint: the legitimate ones don't cater to the hacker crowd because they know perfectly well they can't effect a registry transfer without meeting the registry's criteria for \"legitimate need.\"\n\nIt should be justifiable homicide to shoot and kill spammers, phishers, malware authors, and those asshats attempting dictionary attacks against a bunch of pop3 accounts looking for a new spam vector. Any nation that does not enact such a law should be labeled a rogue threat to humanity and be nuked until there is nothing left to nuke.\n\nShouldn't we instead be referring to \"botnet operators\" or some such? I'm not making the \"hacker\" versus \"cracker\" argument, since language and words are dynamic - but even if we just use hackers in the pejorative sense, we're talking about a much larger group than just the subset who run botnets."}

{"text":"The stunning growth of Internet usage in some countries is also raising concerns about privacy. The qualities that make computer networks such powerful tools for improving efficiency and living standards also give them extraordinary power to collect, store, or distribute medical data, financial data, and other personal or biographical information. Many individuals and consumer groups are calling for new privacy safeguards for the Internet and other computer networks.\n\nPersonal information that may be of interest to businesses or people with malevolent aims is generated whenever people surf the Internet. Companies, for example, are able to learn a great deal about Web surfers who visit their websites. Using tracking devices known as \"cookies,\" companies are able to track purchases and gather personal data. They can use this information to target their marketing efforts at individual consumers or groups of consumers.\n\nWhile some may welcome increased attention to their consumer needs, others may consider it an invasion of their privacy. There is also growing concern about what on-line and conventional stores do with the purchasing or personal data they collect during transactions. Under pressure from consumers, some stores have recently begun to develop privacy policies, but consumer groups say many of these policies fall short.\n\nFinally, patients and consumer advocates want to set rules for the sharing of personal medical data. In each of these areas, it will be difficult to strike a balance between protecting privacy and ensuring a flow of information and data that can enhance quality of life.\n\nThe same Internet-based tools that can improve education, health, and governance can also cause considerable damage when used for purposes of theft or fraud. Companies and individual computer users are being increasingly affected by computer viruses and schemes to steal data or computer identities. Companies are spending enormous amounts of time and money to protect their networks and their data. Recent polls suggest that two thirds of American companies have experienced some form of \"cyber-disruption.\"\n\nResources that could be directed toward improving Internet capacity are being used to thwart cyber criminals. According to an article published in the Financial Times, the average annual cost per company of these disruptions exceeds two million dollars. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has estimated annual losses to industry in the $10-15 billion range. Recent data forecasts that worldwide spending on security will hit $86 billion in 2016 as a result of increased concern over cyber crime from China, which has been made a priority by the Obama administration (Infosecurity, 2012). Internet or computer service disruptions have become a major problem not only for companies, but for governments, associations, international institutions, and private citizens around the world."}
{"text":"Security threats soar in 2005\n\nNearly 16,000 new viruses, worms and Trojans have appeared in 2005, but criminals are moving their focus to niche targeted groups with specially customised malware to steal data and cash.\n\nThe huge increase in the number of malware programs stems from the activities of criminal gangs intent on using trojans, worms and viruses to make a profit, according to a new report from anti-virus software firm Sophos, entitled the Security Threat Management Report 2005.\n\nThese gangs have been focusing their efforts on a smaller number of victims, who are targeted with customised malware, so that the creators of the virus can evade the attentions of anti-virus software vendors and security providers.\n\n\"Internet criminals may be turning their back on large scale attacks not only because they do not wish to draw attention to their efforts, but also because they cannot practically handle the amount of stolen data they might receive if they infected hundreds of thousands of computers in one day,\" the report noted.\n\nA report published in November 2005 by Financial Insights, an IDC company, estimated that global financial institutions lost USD400 million in 2004 due to phishing schemes. Phishing is a system whereby scammers send an email, purporting to be from their financial institution, which induces them to reveal their online banking details.\n\nInstead of going for the large financial institutions, cyber criminals are now engaging in what has been dubbed \"puddle phishing\", where they target a smaller financial institution that may only have a few branches.\n\nAnother phishing phenomenon is the \"spear phishing\" practice, where attackers will target employees in a specific company in an attempt to gain passwords and usernames to access confidential data.\n\nBecause these attacks are so targeted, the most dangerous viruses are unlikely to be included among the top-10 most common viruses, which anti-virus vendors issue to raise security awareness among internet users.\n\nWhile all of the top ten threats are Windows-based worms, the number of Trojan horses written during 2005 outweighs worms by a ratio of two-to-one.\n\nIn 2005, the Zafi-D virus has topped the Sophos list as the most prevalent virus on the internet. The most prevalent virus in 2004, Netsky-P, has dropped to second place this year. Sober-Z - which was only unleashed in November 2005 - has already climbed to third place as it continues to disrupt and clog networks worldwide.\n\nThe other viruses in the top 10 were Sober-N, Zafi-B, Mytob-BE, Mytob-AS, Netsky-D, Mytob-GH, Mytob-EP."}
{"text":"Just what is cyberterrorism?\nThe word cyber relates to the culture of computers, information technology and virtual reality. Terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. Cyberterrorism may therefore be defined as the use of computer technology, as a tool and a vehicle to intimidate and pressurize\nothers.\n\nConsider for a moment the extent to which we have become dependant on computers. In almost any business these days, whether large or small, work is disrupted if the computer system crashes. But computers not only help us run our businesses, they control communications as a whole, such as financial services on a global scale. Without computers, aviation could no longer function and power sources would be paralysed. Essential information and records are stored on computer systems throughout the world. Where would the fight against crime be without computer technology? Computers have become crucial for survival. Take them away and we all take a massive step backwards.\n\nHowever, computers are vulnerable and have their weaknesses, so just how susceptible are we to a deliberate attack?\n\nThe fact is that we are surrounded by the resources to launch a cyber attack. A computer connected to the Internet is all it takes, plus of course, one necessary and essential ingredient - know-how!\n\nIn 1996, realising the dangers of cyberterrorism, President Clinton created the Commission of Critical Infrastructure Protection in order to introduce safeguards. With heightened awareness, various government organizations throughout the world have introduced protective measures with adequate firewalls, more stringent login procedures and password controls including encryption. Groups have been formed to search out and deal with any cyber attacks. Government organizations make regular attempts to gain control of systems to pinpoint any weaknesses. These days, highly sensitive, classified information is often stored on computers with no external connection.\n\nExperts consider that terrorists would prefer to cause damage by blowing something apart, than quietly finding out how to hack into and manipulate a computer system. Terrorists want to make an impact and create headlines for their cause. However, manipulating a computer system itself is one thing, accessing and destroying or changing critical data is another. Because of the World Wide Web and despite considerable expenditure in recent years, data access by persons wanting to cause harm remains a valid threat. Most hacker attacks do not disable a system but corrupt it, making it carry out wrong tasks whilst appearing to function quite normally. For example: corrupting an airline's reservation system data would wreak havoc. Changing pharmacy data on medication could cause numerous deaths.\n\nHowever, whilst such data appears to be at serious risk, the actual risk to mankind is probably less critical. The awareness of the need for computer protection has spread not only to computer specialists throughout the world but also to individual users. Behind every computer is a human being and although the element of human error exists, so does the element of human intervention. Intervention in the sense of prevention - of vigilance, discovery and evasive action."}

These changes have the potential to affect nearly every person's life in hitherto unimagined ways. The weapons themselves are like nothing the world has seen.

Faced with such a puzzle, do we continue to believe in the system of meritocracy or do we conversely find an element of laughable exaggeration in meritocratic claims? I will argue here that some cheering, satirical and system-undermining laughter is much called for in view of the depressing circumstances in which women so often continue to find themselves today, and against the backdrop of the common assumption that gender equality has already been achieved.\n\nBiography Fiona Jenkins is a philosopher in the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University, and Convenor of the ANU Gender Institute.

This Gathering resulted from a partnership between Cranlana and the newly formed WA Committee for Alumni in order to develop some Alumni functions in WA in order to allow everyone to continue their 'Cranlana journey'.\n\nIt was great opportunity for everyone to again discuss and debate the question of human nature, our motivators, inhibitors and the challenges or opportunities for making a 'good society'. The article certainly prompted some significant debate about what constitutes corrupt behaviour and how readily do people participate in such, or indeed become corrupt themselves. There were many references to politics and business, 'group think' and the harm done by not addressing injustices or inappropriate behaviour. Discussion also centred about the role of friends and family in developing ethical people and therefore ethical communities. Thanks to brilliant facilitator, Nicky Cusworth, and generous host, Jan Stewart, from Lotterywest.\n\nThe WA Committee for Alumni will be hosting four events during 2013, with Cranlana providing the readings and question prompts for the facilitator, as well as coordinating the invitations and RSVPs.

{"text":"Beware of malware networks in search engines: report\n\nThe network of components that comprise the prominent \"malnet\" known as Shnakule.\n\nA new security report warns of malware networks (\"malnets\") lurking within Google and other search engines, driving unsuspecting Web surfers to sites where they might share their personal or financial information to unintended parties.\n\nThe Blue Coat Systems 2012 Security Report details the online threats that snared victims in 2011 \u2014 and will probably continue to do so this year. At the top of the list of vulnerable places online are search engines, where Blue Coat's research found was still the main way people access any kind of information on the Internet.\n\nWebPulse Collaborative Defense\/Blue Coat\n\nMalnets exploit search engine, email, social networks to lure users.\n\nThe report makes these central points:\n\nIt's clear from this data that cybercriminals are increasingly using the path of least resistance to create entry points into malnets. The two most popular entry points are Search Engines\/Portals and Email. To exploit these as entry points, cybercriminals need only use them as they're intended to be used by anyone ...\n\nWhat is known as search engine optimization by businesses is called search engine poisoning when used the same way by cybercriminals. To exploit search engines, cybercriminals need only ensure that their sites rank high in the search results page by providing relevant content. They can exploit the very algorithms that search engines rely on to deliver meaningful results to users to ensure that their malicious results are delivered as well.\n\nAnd, while not every part of a malnet is malicious, the red dots in the first image above show a preponderance of malicious components such as exploit servers or malware payloads found in search engine attacks coordinated through the largest malnet, Shnakule. According to this research, it dominated malicious activity on the Internet in 2011. Within its bag of tricks for the average consumer, Blue Coat found fake anti-virus programs, pornography, gambling, \"malvertising\" and work-at-home scams.\n\nCavka, with a focus on scams, was another malnet prominent in North America.\n\nWhile search engines are vulnerable on a daily basis, they are protected, to some extent from malware that thrives on the traffic from headline makers. In 2011, the events that were likely to snag victims through emails and social networks were the Japan tsunami and earthquake, Prince William's royal wedding, and the deaths of Osama bin Laden, Steve Jobs and Amy Winehouse.\n\nInterestingly, attacks that use search engines as the primary entry point typically do not target these big news events. Rather, they target a variety of search terms to cast a wide net. Potential victims searching for news about the current big event are often shielded from malicious results by the sheer volume of legitimate sites with actual content.\n\nThe report warns of these 2012 events as potential magnets for malware to tap into: presidential elections, the release of the new iPhone and iPad, the summer Olympics in London and the \"End of the World\" on Dec. 21."}

{"text":"From my experience, most online competitions are offense based, meaning, your team is trying to capture flags instead of defending.\n\nThanks for the link. That sheds a lot of light into what it is.\n\nIn computer security, Capture the Flag (CTF) is a computer security wargame. Each team is given a machine (or small network) to defend on an isolated network. Teams are scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine and on their success in attacking other team's machines. Depending on the nature of the particular CTF game, teams may either be attempting to take an opponent's flag from their machine or teams may be attempting to plant their own flag on their opponent's machine. CTF was popularized by the hacker conference DEF CON. Currently, the DEF CON CTF competitions are run by Diutinus Defense Technologies Corp. Contests are generally executed in a hotel ballroom or meeting room. A typical contest will have an area for each team playing, arranged around a central area reserved for the contest administrators. Projectors will display a scoreboard on the wall, which will be intermittently interrupted by witty or humorous video clips. Music is usually provided by a PA system during the contest. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world. Reverse-engineering, network sniffing, protocol analysis, system administration, programming, and cryptanalysis are all skills which have been required by prior CTF contests at DEF CON. CTF games often touch on many other aspects of information security, such as physical security, regulatory compliance, and software licensing. Successful teams generally have extensive industry experience and are capable of addressing these issues, even when raised by surprise in the middle of the contest. An international, academic CTF was created by University of California, Santa Barbara in 2004. There have been six iCTF exercises since then, one per year. The 2009 edition occurred on December 4, 2009 and involved 56 teams\u2014up from 39 in the previous year\u2014from across the world, making it the largest live security competition ever performed.\n\nYes and no. yes i havent run into the CTF's.

{"text":"TeamSHATTER and other industry resources have deemed that 2011 is the Year of the Data Breach. October was National Cyber Security Awareness Month and recent data breaches had many talking about security vigilance and data protection.\n\nThe Climate\n\nA study done by Verizon, the US Secret Service and the Dutch High Tech Crime Unit offered some important information regarding data breaches:\n\n92% of data breaches studied were from external agents.\n\n50% used some form of hacking, while 49% incorporated malware.\n\n83% of victims were targets of opportunity.\n\n92% of all attacks were classified as \"not highly difficult.\"\n\n76% of all data was compromised from servers.\n\n86% were discovered by a third party.\n\n96% of breaches were avoidable through simple or intermediate controls.\n\n89% of victims subject to PCI DSS had not achieved compliance.\n\nAlthough there are significant data breaches each and every year, experts point out that data breaches really came into their own in 2011. The trend in previous years was a single, large data breach, for instance credit card data theft from Heartland Payment Systems, or the TJX breach. This year, we witnessed numerous substantial data breaches.\n\nPrivacy Rights Clearinghouse & Data Breaches\n\nAccording to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, over 30 million records were stolen or lost as of October 25, 2011. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse has been tracking data breaches since 2005 and has published a Chronology of Data Breaches. This includes only breached records that contain information that could be deemed useful to identity thieves, for instance Social Security Numbers (SSNs), financial account numbers, driver's license numbers, etc.\n\nIn 2011 alone, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse has tracked 382 breaches, involving 23.2 million sensitive records. It's likely that the number of breached records is much higher, as not all breaches are reported and it's often difficult to determine the actual extent of a data breach before it unfolds.\n\nTop Ten of 2011\n\nAccording to the website Security Dark Reading, the top ten largest data breaches in 2011 are as follows:\n\nComodo (March 15, 2011) \u2013 After an Iranian attacker stole the username and password belonging to a Comodo-trusted partner, he used the credentials to register nine SSL certificates for seven high-profile domains (i.e. Google, Skype and Yahoo, amongst others).\n\nRSA (March 17, 2011) \u2013 Attackers infected an employee at RSA with the Poison Ivy Trojan by exploiting a Flash vulnerability in an Excel spreadsheet. This was carried out through a phishing attack disguised as an email with recruitment information. Through the compromised beachhead in the RSA network, the attackers proceeded to gather information on the SecurID authentication tokens widely used as a two-factor authentication mechanism.\n\nEpsilon (March 30, 2011) \u2013 Attackers got into an email server at Epsilon, a major marketing firm. Over 100 companies depended on this service, including Best Buy, Chase Disney Destinations and Target. Attackers stole customers' names and email addresses, which resulted in worries that advanced phishing attacks would soon result.\n\nAutomattic & WordPress (April 14, 2011) \u2013 Attackers were able to hack a number of servers run by Automattic, the company responsible for maintenance and augmentation of WordPress code. With root-level access, the attackers stole the WordPress source code, the majority of which is open source, but some is proprietary. It's suspected that partner code was also accessed.\n\nSony PlayStation Network (April 17, 2011) \u2013 Sony claimed that a PlayStation hacker (identified as part of the Anonymous movement) and the LulzSec group broke into a host of Sony properties (i.e. PlayStation Network, Qriosity and Sony Online Entertainment). The attack took down the Playstation Netowkr for over a month, affecting around 75 million owners, costing the company an estimated $171 million. Other US game companies, such as Sega and Bethesda Softworks, were also affected.\n\nCitibank (May 2011) \u2013 Hackers stole names, account numbers and contact information from Citibank. The attack took advantage of the poor design of the financial company's website. Hackers accessed customers' accounts by logging into a customer's credit card account and changing the account number in the URL. Attackers gained access to about 360,000 customers' information.\n\nCyWorld (July 28, 2011) \u2013 Hackers access the names, phone numbers and email addresses of about 35 million users from the servers of CyWorld, a social and virtual-world website. The company targeted Chinese hackers for the data breach.\n\nTRICARE (September 13, 2011) \u2013 TRICARE Management Activity is the US military's healthcare provider. In September, it announced that its contractor, SAIC, had lost back-up tapes which contained information on 4.9 million patients. The companies did not disclose if the information was encrypted or unencrypted, nor did they mention the format of the information that was breached.\n\nFacebook (November 1, 2011) \u2013 University of British Columbia researchers sent out over 5,000 Facebook users friend request over eight weeks. With 102 fake accounts, the researchers set out friend requests, which once accepted, were used to connect with even more individuals. The researchers then gathered 250 GB from 3,000 profiles of friend-only data from the accounts. According to their research, about 80 percent of Facebook users could be compromised with a social network.\n\nValve Software's Steam (November 6, 2011) \u2013 Cyber-vandals were responsible for defacing Valve's forum for its Steam game download service. The attackers accessed the database which stored account information on Steam's 35 million users. As of December 2011, the company has not determined the amount of data taken.\n\nSummary\n\nGiven the number of significant data breaches of high-profile companies, 2011 has been deemed the Year of the Data Breach. This article takes a look at the top ten data breaches which occurred this year, affecting organizations such as Facebook, TRICARE, Citibank, and Sony. The article also provides data breach statistics from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.\n\nCCSK Exam Preparation\n\nIn preparation for the Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK), a security professional should be comfortable with topics related to this post, including:"}
{"text":"LOL at people applauding antisec...\n\nAnonymous does this only when they find targets that have known vurnerabilities. They aren't real hackers, and they aren't your friends.

{"text":"Odds are you've heard about the Firesheep hysteria by now. If you still aren't sure what to do about it, here's a short guide to help keep your Internet experience safe.\n\nOne dangerous aspect of Firesheep is that it affects popular websites such as Facebook and Twitter, according to CS50 professor David J. Malan '99. The reason for such widespread susceptibility is that many websites do not use protocols for security over the internet (also known as SSL) and are thus not very secure.\n\nAlthough Malan said that online e-mail services may be at risk, Gmail\u2014a favorite of students\u2014in fact uses SSL and should not be affected. However, Malan noted that Gmail is not necessarily infallible, since some accounts are used to access other web services.\n\nMalan's biggest piece of advice is to use a virtual private network (VPN) client, which allows a user to access a network securely. Harvard students can access the FAS VPN server by going to vpn.fas.harvard.edu. Note: you must enter your username as [username]@fas.harvard.edu.\n\nIn addition to the VPN server, there are free Firefox plugins to boost browsing security, such as HTTPS Everywhere and Force-TLS. These programs attempt to change a website's Hypertext Transfer Protocol from HTTP to the more secure HTTPS. Unfortunately, these add-ons may not be entirely effective. \"They only work if the website supports SSL, as it is more expensive for them to run SSL,\" Malan said.\n\nIn short, here are some tips:\n\n1. Look for sites that use HTTPS. These are more secure and most reliable.\n\n2. For secure network access, use VPN.\n\n3. Keep in mind that your e-mail may not be secure.\n\n4. Try downloading HTTPS Everywhere and Force-TLS.\n\n5. Although tempting, try to avoid accessing vulnerable sites like Facebook during a big lecture class (and on public Wi-Fi in general).\n\nThe most important thing to do is to be smart about surfing the web and not to take security on the Internet for granted. \"Odds are if you can see someone across the room, they could be snooping on you,\" Malan said, while stressing the uncertainty of how things will play out with Firesheep. \"Things are going to be a little unsafe for a while,\" he said."}
{"text":"The first six months of 2012 saw continued increases of malicious infection activity and an intensified danger of email-based attacks as cybercriminals increasingly employed throw-away domains to infiltrate enterprise networks, according to a FireEye report.\n\nResearch shows that over 95 percent of companies are compromised by advanced malware and most are not aware of the attack.\n\nKey findings include:\n\nExplosive growth of advanced malware infections \u2013 Advanced malware that evades signature-based detection increased nearly 400 percent since 2011, to an average of 643 successful infections per week per company.\n\nIntensified danger of email-based attacks \u2013 56 percent growth in email-based attacks in 2Q 2012 versus 1Q 2012. Malicious links were more widely used than malicious attachments in the last two months of the second quarter of 2012.\n\nIncreased use of dynamic, throw-away domains \u2013 An increase in dynamic links that were used five times or less. Originating from large-volume email-based attacks, links that were seen just once grew from 38 percent in the second half of 2011 to 46 percent in the first half of 2012.\n\nPatterns of attack vary substantially by industry \u2013 Patterns of attack were radically different between the financial services, energy\/utilities, healthcare, and technology industries. But one constant remains \u2013 industries with significant intellectual property or customer and financial data remain the primary targets as attacks increase.\n\n\"The results of this report make it even more clear that reactive signature-based defences cannot prevent evasive strains of malware from making their way into the enterprise,\" said Ashar Aziz, FireEye founder and CEO. \"Attackers continue to remain a step ahead of traditional defences, so organisations must rethink their IT security architecture and implement appropriate security measures to prevent advanced cyber attacks such as zero-day attacks and advanced persistent threats (APTs).\"\n\nAs cybercriminals develop and invest in advanced malware, enterprises must reinforce their traditional defences with a new layer of dynamic security that is able to detect unknown threats in real-time, thwarting malware communications back to command and control servers and blocking data exfiltration.\n\nThis extra layer of defence needs to be designed specifically to fight the unknown and zero-day tactics common in targeted attacks and APTs"}

{"text":"Hacked to Death: A Brief History of Tech's Most Two-Sided Term\n\nShare this:\n\nThe word hacker has been everywhere recently, splashed across the front page for weeks as the \"Phone Hacking\" scandal at News of the World engulfed Rupert Murdoch and his media empire. There is a sensational mystique to the term that makes it irresistible to journalists. But typing the default password \"1111\" into the voicemail box of a murdered girl is not hacking. Neither is bribing the police for the phone numbers of celebrities and crime victims. Unless we're ready to call smashing the window on my Honda Civic \"car hacking,\" nothing in the News. Corp scandal fits the bill.\n\"If it had been me, I would have broken into the phone company system, so I could have had direct access to the messages of all their customers,\" said Kevin Mitnick, who was for several years the most wanted computer criminal in America, after hacking into the voicemail computers at Pacific Bell. \"What News Corp. did, guess pin codes, spoofing voicemails, that is amateur script kiddie stuff.\"\n\nMr. Mitnick, who now works as a security consultant and is publishing his first book in August, said he's disappointed to see what passes for hacking these days. \"I can remember writing a program in high school that was supposed to calculate 100 digits of the Fibonacci Sequence. It did that, but of course, it also stole passwords from my professor and classmates. But I didn't get in trouble for that, I got an A, because my teacher recognized it was smart. That's what hacking is supposed to be about, not crime, but innovation and creativity.\"\n\nIn the 1950s, on the campus of The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a great \"hack\" meant a practical joke; covering the campus dome in tin foil, for example. Among the nerdy members of the Model Railroad Club, a hack came to mean a feat of technical skill, a particularly sweet switching station or miniature drawbridge. As these young geeks moved from laying track to working with computers, training massive IBM mainframes to make music and play chess, they took this attitude and vernacular with them.\n\nRuining it for the rest of us\n\nThe word hacker began to mutate, like a quartet of teen turtles, during the late 1980s and early 1990s. What had been a compliment among programmers and engineers became a byword for cyber-crime. Hollywood played a big role: films like WarGames and the eponymous Hackers made the word synonymous with mischief and mayhem.\n\nThe laws that sprung up to combat the rising tide of cyber-crime followed suit. \"Hacking is breaking into computer systems, frequently with intentions to alter or modify existing settings,\" according to the National Conference of State Legislators. \"Sometimes malicious in nature, these break-ins may cause damage or disruption to computer systems or networks.\"\n\nA Google Trends chart of the period between 2004 and today shows the prevalence of hacking in the press isn't just anecdotal, news coverage of hacking over the last three years has grown by leaps and bounds. Some of this coverage has been about real hacking. The attacks that penetrated Google's systems in China and caused the search giant to pull it business out of the country. The infiltrators who stole sensitive data from hundreds of thousands of Sony customers. And the hack-tavism by Anonymous and Lulzsec that defaced websites of major governments and corporations.\n\nvia Google Trends\n\nBut just as often hackers have been convenient boogeymen. For example it turned out to be Rep. Anthony Weiner, not a hacker, who posted a photo of the congressman's package to Twitter. When Pfc. Bradley Manning was arrested for passing classified military documents to Wikileaks, publications like Wired and CNN speculated Pfc. Manning had learned the dark arts from MIT students he partied with at a hack spaces in Boston. The banal truth was that an angry young man with access to information downloaded sensitive files and burned them to a CD. Writing Lady Gaga on the disc was a nice bit of misdirection, but hacking it was not.\n\nThe sad reality is that cyber-crime is on the rise. And in fact News Corp has engaged in computer hacking. As The New York Times recently pointed out, the company paid $29.5 million back in 2009 to settle charges that it hacked into the computer system of New Jersey based company called Floorgraphics and stole information for a smear campaign that cost the the small advertising company several major clients. There were no 9\/11 victims involved, no celebrities or young murder victims, and so the story went largely untold. Hell, the head of U.S. cyber-security, Randy Vickers, resigned on Monday in the aftermath of hacking assaults on the Senate, FBI and CIA websites. Yet only the only major publications to carry the story so far have been foreign outlets, Reuters and The Guardian.\n\nHackers are like Jedi, wielding mysterious powers that enable them to peer into the private lives of normal folks. Just as there are Jedis on the light and dark side, so hackers are divided into white and black hat, a porous boundary which contributes to confusion around the term. Before he built computers, Steve Jobs and his partner Woz built blue bloxes that helped phone phreakers hack their way to free long distance calls. And the most widely known and admired young entrepreneur of this generation, Mark Zuckerberg, has dark hacking in his DNA. He didn't ask for permission when he took the names and faces of his classmates and put them together into Facemash, an early experiment at Harvard that nearly got him expelled.\n\nBut when Zuckerberg sat down earlier this year with Leslie Stahl for a 60 minutes interview, he tried to explain to her that Facebook was strictly white hat. \"The graffiti is largely gone,\" Stahl said to Zuckerberg, during her tour Facebook's fancy new offices, \"except for one word, you just can't miss. I see hack everywhere. Hack! It has a negative connotation, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"When we say hacker, there is this whole definition that engineers have for themselves, it's very much a compliment,\" said Zuckerberg. \"To hack means to build something very quickly. In one night you can sit down and churn out a lot of code and at the end you have a product. Hackathons are these things where all of the Facebook engineer get together and stay up all night building things, and I do too, usually I code alongside everyone.\"\n\nZuckerberg's comment highlights an interesting divide. \"The word now has two branches, the one used among computer progammers and the one used in the media,\" said author Stevy Levy, whose 1984 book Hackers, first introduced the term to the mainstream.\" On one hand it means \"to create\"; on the other \"to steal.\"\n\n\"There was a time when hacker had lost almost all of it positive connotation,\" said Mr. Levy, who wrote in the update to the 2005 edition of his book that he considered dropping the word altogether. \"But the community seems to have really reclaimed it for themselves, and that has spread, to the point where people talk about hacking healthcare or hacking education, and they mean working to make it better.\"\n\nComments\n\n\"But typing the default password \"1111\" into the voicemail box of a murdered girl is not hacking.\" \u2014 I understand this to be precisely the definition of hacking. A \"hack\" was originally (and still is) a journalist who turned out copy of low quality; a \"hacker\" was a person who would attempt to gain access to computer systems by guessing passwords, manually or otherwise.\n\nThe original \"hack\" was actually someone who makes furniture with an axe, as in \"hack together\" or make something work without much sophistication. Using a phonebook to balance a crooked table is an oft-cited example of the prototypical hack.\n\nOver time, clever hacks began to be appreciated by amateur engineers, as distinguished from ugly hacks. So, perhaps, balancing a crooked table with varying thicknesses of nylon on each leg, allowing it to now slide across the floor without marring the floor would be considered an elegant or clever hack as opposed to simply cutting off the legs until they weren't crooked anymore.\n\nSo while a case can be made that guessing passwords to someone's voicemail box is a way of \"hacking together\" a way of getting in, it certainly isn't elegant and in fact requires all the brainpower and morality of a juvenile gang member half-braindead from too much coke, and therefore is certainly the lowliest of hacks if it even qualifies as a hack.\n\nIf Kevin Mitnick were to truly hack into people's voicemails, he would probably do so in a way that was nearly impossible to detect, wouldn't interfere with a police investigation (unless that was his motive), and would give him further access into interesting parts of the system, because a true hacker is a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system. This acquiring of knowledge is very distinct from the messy destruction most \"hackers\" who make headlines cause.\n\nThe second half of the hacker ethic is \"commit no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\" Most people who are part of the hacking community respect this.\n\nIt does not always have a positive meaning within programming (doing something quickly rather than thinking it through). 'Hacking something together' rather than designing it properly. Providing a 'hack' rather than a proper fix. Zuckerberg might be happy to get something demonstrated quickly, but over time some of those hacks might just come back to bite him in the ass.\n\nThere is an argument for designing versus hacking, but if you're a programmer you'll agree that the best code is written out of inspiration, regardless of whether it was designed first or not. In other words, you can design an elegant system, but you can't actually design elegant code; moreso you should meditate on the design and allow that flash of insight to come to you that solves all problems simultaneously with maximum efficiency. That's the sign of an elegant hack and is why the word has its positive, revered meaning.\n\nPeople are so fucking dumb. Most people confuse the terms \"cracker\" and \"hacker\". Lulzsec is a group of \"crackers\". Read the Hacker manifesto and you will see they are the opposite of the connotation. People who finds flaws in things to see how they work and can improve them\u2026\n\nmoney pools in the accounts of boomers who have little technical skill. a younger generation desires those resources. so they will abuse the term to create a phantom enemy so that they may play the white knight protecting your online business. but don't we all sort of suspect that this is what has been all about the whole time? kids with skills creating demand for their own market. you plugged an ex criminal in this post and his coming book. Its all business. so away with your lofty venture into semantics as if this was art.\n\nIt's unfortunate that despite your knowledge of how journalists ruin the word \"hacker,\" you still use that word to describe criminals in this article. Journalists would do everyone a favor if they said \"criminal\" or \"thief\" when they meant criminal or thief, and \"hacker\" when they meant someone who exhibited one of the definitions of hacker: \n\nRemember, hacker is supposed to be an honorific. If they are honorable but also a criminal, then you can say \"malicious hacker\" to distinguish properly.\n\nI disagree. As many of you have noted, cracker has been offered up as an alternative, but that word never got traction with the mainstream media. I could switch to using cracker all the time as some kind of linguistic statement, but I think that would be futile.\n\nI also don't think there is no such thing as a criminal hacker. A hacker in my opinion \u2013 and I don't claim to have the ultimate definition, just a few weeks of research \u2013 is someone who applies technical and creative skill to a project.\n\nAt MIT this first meant a good practical joke, then a good model railroad builder, then a good programmer. The common valence these days is for CS folks, but plenty of the members of NYC resistor think of themselves as hackers, despite working in other fields.\n\nSo I would say hacker is a word I will use, but be careful to qualify. And I will fight against those who use it carelessly, to refer to criminals who fail the Model Railroad Club test \u2013 no technical or creative skill.\n\nThere were a lot of other things that I wanted in the piece that ended up on the cutting room floor, but hopefully this discussion can continue on Twitter, Google+ and in the comments.\n\nSeveral years ago, in a similar article, the author suggested the term \"cracker\" for criminal hackers. A \"hacker\" is really anyone who hacks things together\u2013i.e., whips it up from whatever comes to hand\u2013and is not restricted to the realm of digital technology. Like the fellow who uses baling wire to repair his outboard motor\u2013that sort of thing. Computer hackers were people who had enough programming knowledge to create or alter subroutines on the fly. They were the original IT people. It's sad that the press couldn't come up with their own term for criminal computer activity, but etymological dictionaries are replete with examples of this sort of usurpation.\n\nThank goodness for this article, the incorrect use of the word hacking is my biggest pet peeve, and i normally don't have pet peeves. I totally agree with all that you have said and I am pretty sure i agree with your point of view."}

{"text":"Is Your PC a Hacker Tool? How to Test Security\n\nTHE CUTTING EDGE: FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGY | PC FOCUS\n\nI don't know who was responsible for last week's attacks on Yahoo, EBay, E-Trade and other popular Web sites, but there is a remote possibility that I could have been an unwitting accomplice. That's because I have a cable modem, which connects the PCs in my house to the Internet 24 hours a day. People with digital subscriber lines and businesses with high-speed dedicated lines could be in the same boat.\n\nOne possible explanation for the attacks is that an individual or a group of people used software to automatically plant malicious software on other people's computers, which, in turn, bombarded those sites with millions of bytes of information per second. Because my machines are on all the time, this could happen while I am sleeping.\n\nBeing a potential unwitting cohort in crime is bad enough, but what's more scary is that when you're connected to the Internet, there is also the risk that someone might be able to access data on your computer or know more about you than you care to disclose.\n\nUsers who dial into the Internet with standard modems aren't likely to pass on a hacker's instructions, but their privacy could still be jeopardized.\n\nTo find out if you're vulnerable, visit the Shields Up Web page at  Run by Steve Gibson, head of Gibson Research Corp., the site tests your machine to see if your privacy or data security is at risk.\n\nI tested my Windows PCs on Gibson's page and, until I installed some security software, they were \"wide open.\"\n\nTo begin with, Gibson's Web page greeted me by name, which it inferred from information on my machine. So much for anonymity. If his Web site can figure out my name, so can any other site whose operator is determined to find out who is visiting. Next it told me that my printer, my hard drive and my floppy drive were accessible via the Internet.\n\nI'm a bit of a cynic so I called Gibson to see just how much information he could really extract from my machine. I gave him my Internet protocol (IP) address and permission to hack and, less than a minute later, he told me what directories I have on my hard drive, the names of some of my files and then planted a text file on my hard drive. What's even scarier, he taught me how to do the same using some simple commands with software that's already on all Windows computers. In this case, I disclosed my IP address, but there are plenty of ways for hackers to get that information without your permission.\n\nMinutes later, I was spying on a system myself. I couldn't get into just any machine but I was able to penetrate a friend's system after he gave me his IP address and permission. Once in, I was able to plant files, read the content of his files and copy them to my own PC. I'm not going to tell you how to do it, but--trust me--it's very easy. Fortunately, there are also easy ways to keep your machine from being invaded.\n\nOne method is to install software that creates a \"firewall\" around your machine. Symantec, which makes the popular Norton Utilities and Norton Anti-Virus software, publishes Norton Internet Security. This $59.95 program shields your PC from invaders by blocking unauthorized attempts to get into your system. After I installed it, Gibson's Shields Up Web page was unable to determine my name or anything else about me and neither his Web site nor the tricks he taught me were able to penetrate the program's defenses. In other words, it protected my privacy and the security of my files. The program also scans for viruses and can also be used to block advertising and protect your kids from sexually explicit and other inappropriate Web sites.\n\nBlack Ice from Network Ice ( is another product aimed at keeping hackers out of your computer. This $39.95 program, which works on Windows 95 and 98, scans all traffic between your PC and the Internet and blocks intruders. Both of these programs also have alert features that tell you if someone is trying to get in and they keep a log so you can find out if anyone tried to break in while you were away from your PC.\n\nNorton Internet Security alerts you in \"real time\" so you can detect a potential intrusion as it happens. A small icon near the bottom of your screen flashes when it detects a potential problem. Zone Labs' ZoneAlarm 2.0, which you can download for free at  offers similar protection.\n\nI'm running Black Ice on one machine and Norton Internet Security on another and, on several occasions during the last 48 hours, someone has \"probed\" each of my PCs. A probe doesn't mean that someone was peering into my files or planting a program on my hard drive, but it does mean that an effort was made to identify my machine and possibly to look for security holes. The scary thing about this is that users might not even know this is going on. It's possible for a hacker to plant software on your machine that can later be triggered to violate your privacy or use your machine as an unwitting \"zombie\" to attack other machines."}

{"text":"Let's face it many of us have had at least one account hacked at one time or another perhaps on Twitter, Facebook, e-mail, a website, or even worse, a financial account.\n\nMany of us have software to protect our precious information, but somehow the hackers keep getting in, what to do?\n\nThere are plenty of suggestions and advice on the Internet, but who to turn to?\n\nIn a published article last fall, PCMag.com suggests its top three security suite choices for the New Year: Norton Internet Security (2013), Norton 360 Version 6.0 and Webroot SecureAnywhere Complete.\n\nThis brings us to this week's question,\n\n\"Have You Ever Been Hacked?\"\n\nTell us what your experience was like and how you protect your information from being exposed in the comments below.\n\nyes, yes, I have....my email was hacked a while ago...by spambots i think....no major damage...just a ton of random emails sent to my address book...\"want to buy some vacation property\" type things... :\/\n\nSoftware solutions (such as anti-virus & firewalls) will not prevent users from being hacked or otherwise tricked into being taken advantage of. A minority of most hacks today are because software is not regularly patched or up-to-date. The majority of most \"hacks\" are social engineering techniques that trick users into executing malicious code (malware designed to bypass anti-virus filters) on their computers or providing their login credentials to a spoofed website created to mirror a web site users regularly visit.\n\nIf we're talking about software, I believe the most effective way users can limit their exposure to having their various accounts taken over is by avoiding password reuse and choosing complex passphrases instead. Even better, they may rely on password managers to remember these complex passwords\/passphrases for them.\n\nSoftware such as 1Password, KeePass or LastPass will not completely prevent users from being victims to frequent hack attempts but will provide them with a secure place to store passwords to commonly accessed websites thereby reducing their need to memorize complex passwords or using a single easy-to-guess password across multiple sites.\n\nSoftware aside, the best defense against becoming a victim of hackers is educating yourself on avoiding such events.\n\nTo expand upon Aaron's comments...The internet is not a safe place and any computer user should be skeptical when surfing the internet. Safe use includes:\n\n1. Keep all you software up-to-date.\n2. Maintain and keep an anti-virus program running at all times.\n3. Keep a firewall enabled.\n4. Never click a link included in an email from your bank or financial institution. Instead, enter the known URL into your browser.\n5. Check the URL in the address bar to make sure you're actually at the desired website.\n6. Make sure your wireless devices - phone, iTouch, etc - have anti-virus software.\n7. Limit your banking and financial transactions on your phone as the anti-virus isn't as good.\n8. Download free software at your own risk. Free software may contain key-loggers or other software to gather your confidential information.\n9. Go to unknown websites at your own risk. Skillfully designed websites may exploit known weaknesses in your software. By simply visiting a bad site, you may get infected or hacked.\n10. Use a system to create passwords for your various online accounts. Use something that makes sense to you but that will be different for every site. For instance...Create a system that uses a \"prefix\", \"middle\" and \"suffix\". The prefix could be special characters. The middle could be a set of 4 or 5 characters. The suffix could be part of the website name. For instance, Wells Fargo could be &^19klWF while Bank of America could be &^19klBOA\n\nYes, my emails were hacked about a year ago.

{"text":"Actually, human language is a great example that shows this is not true. You are able to utter sentences that have never been uttered before by combining language constructs recursively. This, as MIT cognitive scientist Steven Pinker illustrates in his book \"The Language Instinct\", is most likely thanks to specialized structures in your brain that arise almost entirely from your genes and that grant you an instinctive ability to understand and create language.\n\nThe idea that everything is repeated and mimicked comes from behaviorism, which, even though it greatly contributed to make psychology what it is today, should be taken with a grain of salt in light of more recent discoveries.\n\nThe cams that were on that spreadsheet are a completely different matter. These cameras plug directly into your internet connection and stream what they see to clients that can authenticate properly with the camera's software.\n\nIt's not a question of activating the camera or exploiting the software. The software was doing what it was designed to do: stream what the camera sees to clients connected to the camera's server. The problem is the cameras allowed people to view the stream without authenticating, which actually might have been by design. Maybe the company thought some users would prefer not having to authenticate, and left the option in for them to choose. If so, it's the users' fault for not using authentication on their security camera.\n\nWebcams don't work like that. At all. To turn your webcam on remotely and watch you, a \"hacker\" would have to basically write a virus that bypasses the strong protections that come with modern operating systems and modern antivirii, which is far from simple, and then find a way to deploy the virus to your computer.\n\nChances are, if you haven't stripped your computer down of all of its defenses, you're completely fine.\n\nThis isn't CSI. No lab geek can just type stuff really quickly into a console window and remotely take control of your computer to watch you through your webcam. If anyone takes control of your computer, it's not because of their skills, it's because you did something\n\nAlso, as me135 said, noone wants to watch you fap. If someone goes through all of that trouble to get a malicious program on your computer, it's to steal your credit card info and take your money. Not to watch you. There are much simpler ways to do that.\n\nIMO, both unilingual anglophones and francophones should just stop complaining about service at uOttawa until they can provide some reliable, not anecdotal, evidence that one side is significantly favored. Without that kind of evidence, it often boils down to confirmation bias. Honestly, uOttawa is one of the few places where people in both languages can get service in both languages, and we should be very happy about that.\n\nNot that I particularly agree with what is said in that video. There's clearly a touch of sensationalism here. But I saw a thread earlier on here that dealt with this issue, so here's an article the Sun wrote on it.\n\nIn both of the cases I mentioned, the victims were swimmers and they were very confident nothing could go wrong. They were fine in the end, though one of them was driven to the hospital just in case, but that's beside the point.\n\nwe're talking about a 25 here, not a 50+\n\nWell you did mention a 50. That's what these guys were doing, without prior practice.\n\nAbout 95% of the people on your team will be qualified to be lifeguards\n\nOk, fine, you won't drown, but if it does happen that you need help because you tried going too far, the experience still won't be pleasant.\n\nI'm not fear-mongering, I'm telling two stories I've witnessed and saying that yes, training in apnea can really help you, but be careful when you do it and don't push your limits too quickly, to avoid an accident.\n\nIn what sense is it your will to desire ice cream if it's just a comes interaction between your neuro- and gastrophysiology that you have no say in?\n\nWell, under the definition I was using earlier, this \"will\" is the neural state that leads me to go get some ice cream.\n\nOur conscious \"choice\" may be to pick between chocolate and vanilla but studies show that this decision is made for us by our neural architecture sometimes tens of seconds before we \"decide\" ourselves.\n\nEarlier in this discussion, we determined that the question comes down to what we call \"the self\". If, as you suggested earlier, it is the actual conscious experience, then no, it isn't making the decision. Under my definition, I am indeed making the decision. Parts of my brain are aware of it, others (such as conscience) only become so a few moments later."}
{"text":"Many international terrorist groups now actively use computers and the Internet to communicate, and several may develop or acquire the necessary technical skills to direct a co-ordinated attack against computers in the United States. A cyberattack intended to harm the U.S. economy would likely target computers that operate the civilian critical infrastructure and government agencies. However, there is disagreement among some observers about whether a co-ordinated cyberattack against the U.S. critical infrastructure could be extremely harmful, or even whether computers operating the civilian critical infrastructure actually offer an effective target for furthering terrorists' goals. While there is no published evidence that terrorist organizations are currently planning a co-ordinated attack against computers, computer system vulnerabilities persist world-wide, and initiators of the random cyberattacks that plague computers on the Internet remain largely unknown. Reports from security organisations show that random attacks are now increasingly implemented through use of automated tools, called 'bots', that direct large numbers of compromised computers to launch attacks through the Internet as swarms. The growing trend toward the use of more automated attack tools has also overwhelmed some of the current methodologies used for tracking Internet cyberattacks. This book provides background information for three types of attacks against computers (cyberattack, physical attack, and electromagnetic attack), and discusses related vulnerabilities for each type of attack.The book also describes the possible effects of a co-ordinated cyberattack, or computer network attack (CNA), against U.S. infrastructure computers, along with possible technical capabilities of international terrorists. Issues for Congress may include how could trends in cyberattacks be measured more effectively; what is appropriate guidance for DOD use of cyberweapons; should cybersecurity be combined with, or remain separate from, the physical security organization within DHS; how can commercial vendors be encouraged to improve the security of their products; and what are options to encourage U.S. citizens to follow better cybersecurity practices. Appendices to this book describe computer viruses, spyware, and 'bot networks', and how malicious programs are used to enable cybercrime and cyberespionage. Also, similarities are drawn between planning tactics currently used by computer hackers and those used by terrorists groups for conventional attacks."}

{"text":"Built by Mike Tassey and Richard Perkins, the Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform (otherwise known as the WASP) is a flying drone that has a 6-foot wingspan, a 6-foot length and weighs in at 14 pounds. The small form factor of the unmanned aerial vehicle allows it to drop under radar and is often mistaken for a large bird. It was built from an Army target drone and converted to run on electric batteries rather than gasoline. It can also be loaded with GPS information and fly a predetermined course without need for an operator. Taking off and landing have to be done manually with the help of a mounted HD camera. However, the most interesting aspect of the drone is that it can crack Wi-Fi networks and GSM networks as well as collect the data from them.\n\nIt can accomplish this feat with a Linux computer on-board that's no bigger than a deck of cards. The computer accesses 32GB of storage to house all that stolen data. It uses a variety of networking hacking tools including the BackTrack toolset as well as a 340 million word dictionary to guess passwords. In order to access cell phone data, the WASP impersonates AT&T and T-Mobile cell phone towers and fools phones into connecting to one of the eleven antenna on-board. The drone can then record conversations to the storage card and avoids dropping the call due to the 4G T-mobile card routing communications through VOIP.\n\nAmazingly, this was accomplished without breaking a single FCC regulation. The drone relies on the frequency band used for Ham radios to operate. Not wanting to get into legal trouble with AT&T and T-Mobile, they tested the technology in isolated areas to avoid recording phone conversations other than their own. The duo play to discuss how to build the WASP at the DEFCON 19 hacking conference.\n\nOur world today is filled with unmanned systems, and they seem to become more and more popular, while manned systems are on the decline. Everything from ATM machines to drone planes, we see more and more about unmanned machines running tasks that human are not required to do.\n\nWe have surveillance cameras along the borders, and even self checkouts at grocery stores. Banking can occur 24 hours day without the need of a human bank teller. There are robots being used to make portions of cars, and even robots being used to pull orders for big box retailers who need to keep up with the speed of the internet.\n\nOnce thing is certain, we will be relying more and more on technology to handle tasks that humans used to do.\n\nGoogle rolls out the new year with a update to its toolbar Page Rank. Googlebot which is Googles information collector is probably one of the hardest working unmanned systems in the World. Crawling the web all day and night looking for new information and checking in on old information along with tons of other functions it performs everyday. At last check via Googles webmaster blog Google uses more than 200 different types of algorithms to determine Page Rank and search engine results position or SERPs.\n\nAs far unmanned systems go Googlebot is probably one of the most profitable unmanned systems to date, able to crawl the web collecting information and than sort it out and placing ads next to the content makes Google millions of dollars in revenue each week. This will be the last unmanned system we feature this year but stay tuned next year because we a have a lot more great articles, pictures and videos on the way!\n\nSome digital vending machines are hitting air ports and convenience stores in South Korea soon and I imagine will one day arrive in the United States.

We have become so dependent on rule-based systems (both technological and social\/legislative) that we have effectively ceased to be able to think flexibly and holistically. As a result we race behind the bad guys fixing a cascade of symptoms, unable to recognise, let alone address, the fundamental disease.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, software development is not such an overwhelmingly complex activity that it's impossible to create error-free code. You just have to pay attention, really understand what you're doing, and, most importantly, actually care about what you're delivering. It seems the majority of developers\/programmers don't , don't and don't - not because they use abstracted high-level development tools but because they rely on such tools to absolve them from taking the personal responsibility for getting it right. It's an attitude problem before all, and is no different from the almost universal desire of our student population to get the degree without having to make the effort required to actually learn the subject.\n\nWe need people in charge of our security (and that includes not only \"security specialists\" but also application and service designers, programmers, testers, deployers, service managers and users) who actively seek to bear the requisite responsibility for fulfilling that task . Such people will make sure of their own accord that they are sufficiently competent to do so. Absent that attitude, no training programme will help."}

{"text":"Cyber crime remains the leading business risk for organisations of all sizes.\n\nAccording to Symantec's 2011 State of Security survey, this is the second year in a row that cyber security has ranked higher than traditional crime, natural disasters and terrorism. Of the 3,300 C-level professionals from 36 countries surveyed, the majority of respondents suffered damages as a result of cyber attacks, yet more reported a decline in the number and frequency of attacks compared to 2010.\n\nDespite there being a drop in the number of respondents who saw attacks in the past 12 months, with 71 per cent reporting attacks in comparison to 75 per cent in 2010, 92 per cent of companies saw losses from cyber attacks in 2011, down from 100 per cent last year.\n\nCyber security was named as somewhat or significantly more important than 12 months ago according to 41 per cent of respondents while in contrast, only 15 per cent think it is somewhat or significantly less important.\n\nGreg Day, EMEA security CTO and director of strategy at Symantec told SC Magazine that while 71 per cent of businesses reporting attacks is high, the biggest cost is downtime.\n\nAnother statistic was that according to their own assessment, 52 per cent of the respondents said they are doing somewhat or extremely well in addressing routine security measures, while 51 per cent reported that they are doing somewhat or extremely well in responding to security attacks or breaches.\n\nDay said: \"This shows that most are dealing better with attacks, but the growth area is targeted attacks. They get into the chinks in the armour and my belief is that businesses realise that they need to change tactics with the way that they cope with attacks.\"\n\nAsked if the advanced persistent threat (APT) is a rising concern within organisations, Day said it was, but it was important to know the difference between an APT and a targeted attack.\n\n\"No matter how much security you add, there will always be a way in. Even if you are not a global company, more organisations are seeing attacks and with so many tools and techniques available, it is becoming so easy,\" he said.\n\nThe survey further found that 29 per cent of companies experience attacks on a regular basis, while 21 per cent said that the frequency of attacks is increasing with the top attack vectors being malicious code, social engineering and external malicious attacks.\n\nSean Doherty, vice president and chief technology officer of enterprise security at Symantec, said: \"There's no question that attackers are using more insidious, sophisticated and silent methods to steal data and wreak havoc. Organisations today have more to lose than ever before and need to keep adopting the security innovations and best practices that the industry is delivering to stay protected"}
{"text":"The House of Representatives is set to vote on landmark cybersecurity legislation to protect the nation's computer systems. This may be Congress's best hope for a significant, bipartisan achievement in 2012 \u2014 and it is certainly necessary if we are to achieve the true potential of the internet and an empowered digital society.\n\nOur associations and the companies we represent have been at the forefront of critical policy discussions that have fostered the internet's growth into the world's most important economic and social platform. We are proud to be part of a U.S. technology industry that is leading the world in innovation and advancing our nation's economic competitiveness.\n\nAs such, we are particularly concerned with doing everything we can to secure the Internet against a rising tide of cybersecurity threats that pose serious harm to citizens, businesses, and government institutions. FBI Director, Robert Mueller, recently warned that very soon the \"cyber threat will pose the number-one threat to our country.\"\n\nEvery day, more than one million adults are the victims of cybercrime \u2014 that's more than 800 every minute. From 2009 to 2010 alone, the volume of internet based intrusions per day increased by 93 percent. More than two thirds of online adults (69 percent) have been a victim of cybercrime in their lifetimes. Ninety five percent of the data from cyber intrusions is personal information such as Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, addresses and the like.\n\nMany of these attacks are sophisticated and the tactics are constantly evolving. To defend against them, we must be equally sophisticated and nimble in our response. Every year, our industry invests billions of dollars in research and development to improve our cybersecurity capabilities. At the same time, our partnerships with federal, state and local governments get stronger. But there is always room for improvement.\n\nThat's why we support the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, sponsored in the House by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.). It gives the federal government an important new ability to share information about cyber threats with America's businesses, and it gives businesses permission to voluntarily share with government and each other so they can take steps to defend themselves. It's a reasonable and essential measure that will help create better collective risk mitigation by putting tangible threat information in front of public and private-sector IT professionals who can act on it to protect our national and economic security.\n\nSome have raised legitimate concerns about the privacy and civil liberties implications of companies sharing their data with government. We understand those concerns and take them seriously. We are encouraged that after consulting with leading stakeholders, Rep. Rogers and Rep. Ruppersberger have proposed amending their bill to tighten key definitions and procedures in recognition of the country's dual interests in bolstering cybersecurity and protecting privacy.\n\nIn addition to the Rogers-Ruppersberger bill, we urge the House to pass several other measures that will improve the country's cybersecurity posture: Rep. Darrell Issa's (R-Calif.) Federal Information Security Amendments will provide stronger oversight of the security of federal computer systems. The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, sponsored by Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), will better coordinate federal research into cybersecurity. Finally, we support a bill from Rep. Ralph Hall (R-Texas) that will reauthorize research and development of important new computing technology called the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program.\n\nThe technology sector will not support an overly prescriptive approach toward cybersecurity innovation, because it would be counterproductive, nor will we support an approach that undermines citizens' rights. We believe the best defense against cyber threats is rapid, adaptive technological innovation. The measures up for consideration this week provide a good, commonsense framework to help government and private-sector organizations move as quickly as the hackers and criminals who are out to do us all harm.\n\nIf Congress passes these bills, the winners will be the millions of ordinary American citizens who rely on the safety and security of the Internet every day.\n\nHolleyman is President and CEO of the Business Software Alliance. Osborne is President and CEO of TechAmerica. Ramsey is President and CEO of TechNet."}
{"text":"ENISA: Awareness on Cyber Security in the Maritime Sector Is Non-Existent\n\nA report from the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) highlights the fact that security is not taken as seriously as it should be in the maritime sector.\n\nThe figures show that 52% of the goods traffic in 2010 was made by sea, which means that this sector of the industry is highly important both to society and to global economy.\n\nWhat many don't know is that most activities related to water transport rely on state-of-the-art computational and communications systems, which means that they're just as exposed to hacking operations as nuclear plants and other components of national infrastructures.\n\nThis is why ENISA has come forward to propose a set of measures that should be applied worldwide, but primarily in the European Union, based on the high risks that exist due to the potential vulnerabilities that may lie in the current Information Communication and Technology (ICT) systems.\n\nThe agency recommends that member states develop and implement awareness raising campaigns that target the maritime sector. It's their belief that all the actors involved, including shipping companies and port authorities, should offer training to their employees to make them aware that threats exist.\n\n\"Security by design for all critical maritime ICT components\" is also recommended since the challenges to secure existing systems may be too high for anyone to properly handle.\n\n\"As current maritime regulations and policies consider only the physical aspects of security and safety, it is recommended that policy makers add cyber security aspects to them,\" reads the report.\n\nThe best practice for securing this specific sector would be to align and harmonize international and European policies, especially when it comes to cybersecurity, since the fragmentation of the current maritime context makes it difficult to deploy protection measures.\n\nInformation exchange between the stakeholders, statistics on cybersecurity, coordination and cooperation between those involved (port authorities, shipping companies and even CERTs) are also among the advices given by ENISA regarding the maritime sector's security."}

{"text":"Tuesday is traditionally the day of the big RSA keynotes. Art Coviello always kicks these off. I don't know what he said because I missed it but I am reliably informed that he said some stuff about the cloud. Good for him.\n\nI was more interested in the next two keynotes from Microsoft and Symantec. First up, Scott Charney, CVP for Microsoft Trustworthy Computing Group. He said some good things and some challenging ones.\n\nHe said that people have struggled to understand the threat. True. He also said that we need to start innovating about prevention and mitigating. Also true.\n\nHe suggested that perhaps we adopt a healthcare model (presumably not the NHS) in that we beat disease by educating people about lifestyle risks, but there are limitations to this approach. Smoking causes cancer, a good reason to quit, but education can only do so much in the online world. People are aware of the risks in using the web but by and large they tend to be absent-minded when it comes to updating AV or simply challenged by the process. So why make it hard, Charney asked. Why aren't we cleaning machines before they access the internet?\n\nThe answer is that no one can be bothered. As long as ISPs can get away with dirty pipes, by putting the responsibility onto their customers - then the internet will remain a threat.\n\nHe moved on to the cloud and posed some serious questions. Who, for example is going to do forensics in the cloud? Who will monitor the activities of state agencies when they go looking for personal data in the cloud? This was something I have not thought about before. Technology, he said, has enabled state agencies to access personal data with greater speed with the potential to ignore due process.\n\nWith their data scattered across different clouds and different hosts, how can the private citizen be assured that their details are not abused? Those of us living in the UK where certain agencies have developed an almost Stasi-like thirst for citizen data the onset of an uncontrolled and unregulated cloud ecosystem is worrying. Governments monitor their populations in the name of crime prevention or anti-terror - but increasingly they do it because they can. Technology is making it easier for a surveillance society to cross borders and invade our privacy. As Charney said, IT should not dictate social policy. So, a Microsoft keynote that wasn't just about Microsoft.\n\nSymantec CEO Enrique Salem took the stage after Charney and quickly warmed to his theme of the information economy, which he said would emerge during this decade. Some might argue that we are already there.\n\nThis was a much more confident performance than last year. Clearly Salem is warming to his task at the head of the world's largest software company. While much of what he said wasn't new, it was convincing.\n\nThe video spot featuring Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff actually provided the best soundbites. These included: 'Why isn't all enterprise software like Facebook?' and 'When are we going to let go of the past and invent the future?' He urged us to be aware of the Facebook imperative.\n\nSalem's pitch summed up the theme at this year's conference. It's actually less about security, more about the overwhelming ubiquity of the mobile imperative. The merging of everything, everywhere.\n\nThe cloud, mobile and social media are all inextricably linked and the relationship between all three relies on trust and those that can address security, privacy and compliance will be the big winners, he said.\n\nBoth Charney and Salem believe that in this new world trust is paramount. They are both right but can they build it?"}

{"text":"Computer scientist looks for bad guys in cyberspace\n\nFeb 11, 2013\n\nSandia National Laboratories computer science researcher Jeremy Wendt concentrates on working on a program to find potential targets of nefarious emails. Credit: Randy Montoya\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014The weakest link in many computer networks is a gullible human. With that in mind, Sandia National Laboratories computer science researcher Jeremy Wendt wants to figure out how to recognize potential targets of nefarious emails and put them on their guard.\n\nHis goal is to reduce the number of visitors that cyberanalysts have to check as possible bad guys among the tens of thousands who search Sandia websites each day.\n\nUltimately, he wants to be able to spot spear phishing. Phishing is sending an email to thousands of addresses in hopes a few will follow a link and, for example, fall for a scam offering millions of dollars to help a Nigerian prince wire money out of his country. Spear phishing, on the other hand, targets specific email addresses that have something the sender wants.\n\nWendt has developed algorithms that separate robotic web crawlers from people using browsers. He believes his work will improve security because it allows analysts to look at groups separately.\n\nEven if an outsider gets into a Sandia machine that doesn't have much information, that access makes it easier to get into another machine that may have something, Wendt said.\n\n\"Spear phishing is scary because as long as you have people using computers, they might be fooled into opening something they shouldn't,\" he said.\n\nIdentifying malicious intent\n\nSandia cybersecurity's Roger Suppona said the ability to identify the possible intent to send malicious content might enable security experts to raise awareness in a potential target. \"More importantly, we might be able to provide specifics that would be far more helpful in elevating awareness than would a generic admonition to be suspicious of incoming email or other messages,\" he said.\n\nWendt, in the final stretch of a two-year Early Career Laboratory Directed Research and Development grant, presented his work at a Sandia poster session.\n\nWendt has looked into behaviors of web crawlers vs. browsers to see if that matches how computers identify themselves when asking for a webpage. Browsers generally say they can interpret a particular version of HTML\u2014HyperText Markup Language, the main language for displaying webpages\u2014and often give browser and operating system information. Crawlers identify themselves by program name and version number. A small number Wendt labels \"nulls\" offer no identification, perhaps because the programmer omitted that information, perhaps because someone wants to hide.\n\nWhat Wendt is looking for is a computer that doesn't identify itself or said it's one thing but behaves like another and trolls websites in which the average visitor shows little interest.\n\nGoing to an Internet site creates a log of the search. Sandia traffic is about evenly divided between web crawlers and browsers. Crawlers tend to go all over; browsers concentrate on one place, such as jobs.\n\nCrawlers, also known as bots, are automated and follow links like Google or Bing do. \"When we get crawled by a Google bot, we aren't being crawled by one visitor, we're being crawled by several hundreds or thousands of different IP addresses,\" Wendt said. An IP or Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to devices on a computer network, identifying the machine and its location.\n\nDistinguishing bots and browsers\n\nSince Wendt wants to distinguish bots from browsers without having to trust they're who they say they are, he looked for ways to measure behavior.\n\nThe first measurement deals with the fact bots try to index a website. When you type in search words, the crawler looks for pages associated with those words, disregarding how they're arranged on a page. That means a bot pulls down HTML files far more often.\n\nWendt first looked at HTML downloads. Bots should have a high percentage. Browsers pull down smaller percentages.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the nulls pulled down nothing but HTML\u2014typical bot behavior.\n\nA single measurement wasn't enough, so Wendt devised a second based on another marker of bot behavior: politeness.\n\nBots could suck down webpages from a server so fast it would shut down the server to anyone else, he said. That might prompt the site administrator to block them.\n\nSo bots take turns. \"They say, 'Hey, give me a page,' then they may crawl a thousand other sites taking one page from each,\" Wendt said. \"Or they might just sit there spinning their wheels for a second, waiting, and then they'll say, 'Hey, give me another page.'\"\n\nSome behavior is 'bursty'\n\nBrowsers go after only one page but want all images, code, and layout files for it instantly. \"I call that a burst,\" he said. \"A browser is bursty; a crawler is not bursty.\" Bursts equal a certain number of visits within a certain number of seconds.\n\nNinety percent of declared bots had no bursts and none had a high burst ratio. Sixty percent of nulls also had no bursts, lending credence to Wendt's identification of them as bots.\n\nBut 40 percent showed some bursty behavior, making them hard to separate from browsers. However, normal browser behavior also falls within set parameters. When Wendt combined both metrics, most nulls fell outside those parameters.\n\nThat left browsers who behaved like bots. \"Now, are all these people lying to me? No. There could be reasons somebody would fall into this category and still be a browser,\" he said. \"But it distinctly increases suspicions.\"\n\nHe also looked at IP addresses. Unlike physical addresses, IP addresses can change. Say you plug your laptop into the Internet at a coffee shop, which assigns you an IP address. After you leave, someone else shows up and gets the same IP address. So an IP address alone doesn't necessarily distinguish users.\n\nThere's another identifier: a particular browser on a particular operating system, which leads to what's called a user agent string. There are thousands of distinct strings.\n\nIP addresses and user agent strings can collide, but Wendt said odds are dramatically lower that two people will collide on the same IP address and user agent string within a short period such as a day. That tells him they're probably different people.\n\nNow he needs to bridge the gap between splitting groups and identifying targets of ill-intentioned emails. He has submitted proposals to further his research after the current funding ends this spring.\n\n\"The problem is significant,\" he said. \"Humans are one of the best avenues for entering a secure network.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nComputer scientists in India have developed a two-pronged algorithm that can detect the presence of a botnet on a computer network and block its malicious activities before it causes too much harm. The team ...\n\nWeb site policy makers who use robots.txt files as gatekeepers to specify what is open and what is off limits to Web crawlers have a bias that favors Google over other search engines, say Penn State researchers whose study ...\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014How unsafe are mobile browsers? Unsafe enough that even cyber-security experts are unable to detect when their smartphone browsers have landed on potentially dangerous websites, according to areAs someone that has pored over accesslogs daily since 1997 this is obvious. I wrote a daemon that runs as root and accepts piped weblog output and automatically bans suspicious ip addresses with iptables, and distributes the knowledge via mysql replication to other servers to defend themselves. Length of ban is proportional to number of times banned, or any other combination of rules, and I have collected over a million hacked ip addresses and spams from zombies and proxies. One day it might be useful to someone.\n\nAgent strings can't be trusted at all, and behaviour can be synthesized, especially if attacker reads this!\n\nFor email, best way of avoiding spear phishing is to prominently display the source ip address and resolved address. Even an idiot can tell that it isn't from paypal if it came from Vietnam, however cleverly crafted the mail. Outlook and mobile phone mail apps do not show this basic info unless the user jumps through hoops to find it. SPF & DKIM should be enforced too"}
{"text":"Wednesday, May 9, 2012\n\nWhat Motivates the Mind Of a Hacker?\n\nIdentity theft, I sort of get, the money, the credit. Bullying, I sort of get too, feel better about yourself by making another person feel worse. Even the anonymous comments on my blog that are meant to get me upset, I sort of get, because they are aimed at me. But hacking? I do not get this at all. MACs are unlikely to get computer viruses because 5% of the population uses MAC, the other 95% uses windows...so hackers do not want to waste their hacking time on just 5%. What could have invaded the essence of a hacker so much that they would want to take revenge on a whole society of unknown human beings? What could have been so unfair that masses of blameless people have to suffer payback? If I would someday like to write I think I have to come a little bit closer to understanding this nature. But I am not close right now. I feel sad for the anonymous hackers of the world, living their lives in cowardly desperation.\n\nI have many times wondered the exact same thing. Maybe the need for power over a large group of people...maybe just teenagers with nothing better to do. These people need a goal in their lives. Do you have a Mac? Did someone hack it????\n\nthe satisfaction someone gets by hurting someone else is not ok in any way shape or form, no one is perfect i may have been a bully while a small child. but you grow and you learn you can't blame kids for being kids not one kid is 100% perfect. But adults??? come on?? grow up and get a life and please find another hobby, hacking, identity theft and bullying others while hiding behind a computer screen is one of the lowest things someone can do. ;-(\n\nWell said; I don't get it either but there are a lot of things I don't get-domestic violence, animal abuse, the slaughtering of innocent baby animals; the list could go on and on. I think those that get off at the expense of others need to find something to do. Have a great day tomorrow. Noreen\n\nI don't get it either.My blog was hacked a week ago.Actually it was shabbyblogs.com but I was using one of there backgrounds.Thank goodness a fellow blogger told me she could not get on my blog.I took it off ASAP.I just don't get it.The good news is I had to redo my blog and I actually like it better now. Anne\n\nI think- just my opinion- that it's a thrill thing. It takes a level of skill and the more they hack the more they want to because they want the thrill of getting better at it, to gain a rep even. They tend not to think about the people they might hurt because the victims faceless- it's rather a cowardly crime if you ask me.\n\nHackers are just people who try to bully others for some reasons. They're too cowardly (as you said) to man up and say what is really bothering them so they just rather ruin a reputation. Sad and pathetic.\n\nThe mind of a hacker is just a mind of a computer genius that feels slighted and usually doesn't have control in his\/her life so they try and control the uncontrollable. It all breaks down to this. Hurt people hurt people, anyway they can. They need prayer like all of us hurt people do.\n\nUh oh, this is a real sore subject with me...I have wondered what motivates them too and the conclusion I have to come to is they just love making people miserable which makes them miserable people too. In my humble opinion, I think that they are dangerous and can have far reaching affects on us. So....this christian grandmother would like to 'beat them up'...then, of course I'd have to pray for forgiveness and for their healing. xo\n\nSome hackers are just lonely introverted souls who like the idea that they can disrupt the world...beat the system...demonstrate their 'superiority'. I believe that many of them look at hacking as a game or a challenge...beating the odds and the 'system'. They frequently don't relate well to real people. I think that most of them are just 'gaming' an inanimate 'thing', and they don't relate their actions to anyone or any group in particular. Of course, there are those who just want to stick it to the government or big business. Like much of society, the hacker society is a complex group with many reasons driving them to do what they do. Just my opinion... Take Care, Big Daddy Dave\n\nYou hit it dead center. I have heard it said that hackers hack because they can! They are the ultimate computer geek who has no concept of or concern for the trouble they cause. They're too busy saying \"I did it!\" or \"How cool I am to be able to do this big thing.\" It is a game! A game for idiots!!\n\nI don't get it either. How does this become some kind of a \"RUSH\" or adrenaline fix for them. Or so I have read. Who knows what triggers this ridiculous entertainment for them. Do they know its illegal? Oh, maybe thats it? The thrill of thinking they can get away with something and not get caught.\n\nI often wonder that same thing. Why in the world would they waste their time to anonymously hurt strangers? If they are smart enough to know how to hack, you would think they could do something so much better with those smarts!\n\nAmen- I think that hackers are desperately solitary people that have no control over most of their life so they are going to take whatever control they can in as public a way as they can...it is their only \"claim to fame\" and, even then, cannot be acknowledged by them. Sad...really sad...xo Diana\n\nI don't understand either - but then there are so many things I don't understand - never have. I was raised with a father who was a police officer, and coupled with my Christian upbringing, have always had a very healthy respect for the law and what was right, so try as I might, I cannot get inside the head of people who hack, or steal identities, or whatever...\n\nI think it's the power, the challenge, the fact that they CAN. But I don't understand the why of it - why they get such enjoyment out of such a mindless pursuit, when they could do so many things that are worthwhile with their minds. It's sad, really...\n\n\"I feel sad for the anonymous hackers of the world, living their lives in cowardly desperation.\" What a great line! And actually, I think you do get hackers. They are desperate for attention, but cowardly about it.\n\nThose anonymous comments are usually spam or say some very upsetting things and for the few people that leave those comments I now have to approve every comment now. I don't get it either. The hacking problems? These people that hack into computers and develop the viruses must be smart. Why aren't they using their talents for good? Arrggh....\n\nYou are so right! I don't understand hackers at all. It has never made sense to me why you would want to do such a weird thing to someone you've never met...and you don't really get anything out of it.\n\nyeah. it is just sad. Those are geeks who do things just because they can. They get the euphoric becasue they have done what is previously deemed not possible or because it challenges them to break into a security. it's all about ego.\n\nIt's all too familiar, a friend of mine faced identity theft and I was almost scammed once myself. It was called the Ammyy Scam, I made sure to write in detail what happened just to help out the next person, I've had a lot of hits due to this fraud :  :) Danica\n\nI have been getting strange e-mails that say Amazon.com LLT received my cancellation and they have cancelled what looks like a book order. I did not order anything. I did a good search asking a question and discovered that a Canadian pharmacy is doing this as a scam. I have a bounce system that tells the sender that their message could not go through because the receiver is unknown. Hopefully they will stop soon. I have NO trouble with my comments on my blog. I receive notice each time I have a comment and then I publish it if it is OK. There is NO need for captchas those difficult to read words.\n\nSomeone got the number of one of my cards, had to have been off the computer. I only order flowers with this card never take it in my purse. Shread all papers from my crdet cards. They bought airline tickets before Christmas. They tried to buy some more after Christmas but they were refused. When I got my bill I saw the charges and called. I paid none of them and they gave me a new number. I think they are sad people."}

If not, why not?\n\nThe US called McKinnon \"the world's most dangerous hacker\" after he penetrated almost 100 US military systems from his bedroom in North London, \"crashing the US Army's Washington network of 2,000 computers for 24 hours,\" as Times Online once described it.\n\nHe lost his House of Lords appeal against the extradition last month, but appealed to the European court of human rights, which granted the extension.\n\nMcKinnon said he'd surfed into the American military computers because he was looking for evidence of a UFO cover-up.\n\nBut he wasn't caught because of sterling work by American security experts.\n\nHe'd left his real email address.\n\n\"Mr McKinnon who was born in Glasgow but lives in London, faces up to 70 years in prison if found guilty in the US of breaking into military computers,\" says the BBC, adding:\n\n\"His lawyer Karen Todner said he still denies causing damage, which the US authorities put at $800,000 dollars (\u00a3532,500), but signed a statement offering to plead guilty to a different charge under the Misuse of Computers Act in a bid to remain in the UK.\" Stay tuned.\n\nWould you like to comment and discuss this posting?

{"text":"I would never do this. I am just a person who loves learning and knowledge. How would one do something like this?\n\n-SpectraL\n\n02-10-2009, 04:24 PM\n\nThe \"organizing criminal activity\" concern always comes into play in situations such as these, yet the pursuit of knowledge should never be left in the dust either.\n\nOne thing about cyber-crime you should know is that the mission should be a noble or profitable one, not just some lame desire to bother someone on the Internet. It should have a purpose, and harassing people on the Internet is not something real cyber-criminals generally subscribe to. \"The pursuit of knowledge\" is rarely tied to such fruitless excursions.\n\nBut IF there was in fact a good reason for such an endeavor, the first step one would usually take is to get behind a series of buffers... we're talking chained proxies, encrypted code and advanced social engineering. If one simply goes out willy-nilly and starts trying to inject a drive-by auto-downloader\/firewall-killer into the blog-owner's file system, that mad adventurer would soon be trying to log into his\/her ISP only to come up with a dead DSL light. Preparation is the first step to a successful mission. Once as fully prepared as possible (although those in this field can never be truly and completely prepared), only then one can begin to formulate the entry point. The getting in is usually easier than one would imagine, but it's the getting out undetected that becomes the difficult part. From what I've read in your opening post here, it does not sound like it to me that you have your horses painted yet, so it would hardly be of any use to proceed with the pursuit of the kind of knowledge you are looking for at this point in time."}
{"text":"Since the introduction of social networking to the internet, teenagers, college students, baby boomers and even senior citizens have signed up. Unfortunately for all of them, cyber criminals have as well.\n\nA recent study by Panda Security documented the protective standards of social networking and found 33 percent of small- and medium-sized businesses reported a malware infection through social networking for business use. The impact has worsened as well, as 35 percent of those businesses suffered a financial loss while trying to recover from a social media-based malware attack. The study, which investigated 315 SMBs in the United States, found the financial loss for more than one-third of businesses affected by malware exceeded $5,000. Because of the benefits of social networking for business purposes, the increased use puts more enterprise networks at risk for malicious software.\n\n\"Social media is now ubiquitous among SMBs because of its many obvious business benefits, yet these tools don't come without serious risks,\" said Sean-Paul Correll, threat researcher at Panda Security.\n\nHowever, businesses have the resources to reduce the threat of social networking more easily than consumers can. Companies like Clutter Free PC ( and Ascentive, LLC, have been providing tools to businesses for over ten years. Sadly, many consumers are still unaware that they need the same protection.\n\n\"In Panda's first annual Social Media Risk Index, we set out to uncover the top SMB concerns about social media and draw a correlation to actual incidence of malware infection, privacy violations and hard financial losses,\" Correll added. \"While a relatively high number of SMBs have been infected by malware from social sites, we were pleased to see that the majority of companies already have formal governance and education programs in place. These types of policies combined with up-to-date network security solutions are required to minimize risk and ultimately prevent loss.\"\n\nFor consumers, the threats of social networking still loom. Although Facebook has become popular among businesses, the leader in social networking is also the leader in malware threats, at 71.6 percent, and privacy violations, at 73.2 percent. The popular online video website YouTube was the second most dangerous social networking site, but was far behind Facebook with 41.2 percent of all social networking malware. Twitter showed a significant threat for privacy violations, following Facebook with a risk for 51 percent of all information leaks.\n\nMalware and privacy threats have consistently increased as social networking has blossomed into its current state. However, internet users have still been drawn to social media, as Facebook currently touts more than 500 million registered users and Twitter has exceeded 200 million registrations. Even foursquare, a relatively young social networking site based in which users can share their favorite locations, has recently reached 3 million users.\n\nA quick review of Clutter Free PC Stories shows us that internet users are still drawn to social media sites, despite the recent spike in security and privacy risk. Security experts advise them to install protective anti-malware software that could make for an enjoyable social networking experience without the risk of their computers contracting a virus.

{"text":"About the project\n\nThe Internet plays a positive role in our lives and societies, but the Internet is also used for illegal purposes. It is used for many forms of cybercrime, including attacks on critical infrastructures. The Internet is also used for terrorist purposes. The prevention of illegal activities, also when committed with help of the Internet, is of common interest to governments, security authorities, the Internet sector and Internet users.\n\nPublic private cooperation\n\nTerrorist use of the Internet has been researched in the past, and attempts have been made to include the use of Internet in the fight against terrorism. None of these attempts, however, were based on a systematic dialogue with the private sector. Such government-only initiatives run the risk of resulting in legislation which is technically unfeasible, unworkable or insufficiently supported by end users.\n\nThe Internet is largely in private sector hands, and it is likewise there that most Internet expertise is concentrated. Law enforcement agencies and intelligence services posses most knowledge about terrorist activities. Public-private cooperation is therefore a logical approach in understanding terrorist use of the Internet, and it was an important rationale behind the initiation of Clean IT.\n\nThe Clean IT project comprises a process by which public and private sector parties engage in an open and constructive dialogue. In this dialogue, Internet related solutions that can improve the prevention of terrorist threats society faces are explored. The project team facilitates the dialogue. The project was started in June 2011 and will end in March 2013.\n\nDefinition\n\nThere are many views on terrorism and the ways in which terrorists make use of the Internet. A lot of research have been done and there are many publications on the matter. The Clean IT project started off, therefore, defining what participants understood by the term terrorism.\n\nJihadism, right-wing radicalism and separatist movements such as those in Northern Ireland and Spain can all be categorized as terrorism. As the greatest current threats on a European level come from the jihadist movement Al Qa\u00efda, this movement has received most attention in the Clean IT project. Other forms of terrorism are not excluded, though a strict demarcation between the kinds would likely be of little relevance to the project outcomes.\n\nTerrorist use of the Internet\n\nThe phenomenon of the use of Internet for terrorist purposes is not the medium as such. Terrorists use the Internet on a daily basis. From a technical perspective, terrorist use of the Internet is not substantially different from regular, legal use of the Internet. Terrorists use the same popular, easy to use Internet services as other users do, and they also use tools to conceal their identity and activities. Terrorists use the Internet mainly as a resource. Terrorist activities on the Internet can be found in the easy-accessible part of Internet where social media is used, and many forms of user-generated content is exchanged. This is also the place where violent propaganda material is spread, and the process of finding new recruits for terrorist acts and radicalization begins. On the Internet, ideological websites can be found that often contain illegal material (nevertheless the illegality of content may depend on how the material is presented and its context). These ideological websites often glorify and encourage violence, and are used to distribute training manuals and other information on how to commit terrorist acts. In addition, the Internet is used to plan and organize deadly attacks.\n\nProject objectives\n\nThe objectives of the Clean IT project are as follows:\n\na) To start a constructive public-private dialogue about terrorist use of the Internet.\n\nBecause the Internet is a collective good, the ambition is to have an equal representation of public and private interests. It is vital, moreover, that all participants in the dialogue share the same perception of what is understood to be terrorist use of the Internet. The Clean IT meetings were set up to accommodate both these aims.\n\nb) To draft a set of \"general principles\" that are supported by both public and private parties.\n\nThe project does not aim to find results in a legislative form. The \"general principles\" will have the status of a code of conduct, as encouraged for example by the European Commission in article 16 of the E-commerce guideline. The general principles must be supported by the parties involved and provide direction on how to deal with terrorist use of the Internet.\n\nc) To identify \"best practices\" which, after possible modification, could in the opinion of the Clean IT participants contribute to asuccessful reduction of the impact of terrorist use of the Internet.\n\nThe actual implementation of any of the best practices is not a project objective. This is up to each party to consider voluntarily and upon its own responsibility. Any future implementation of best practices must comply with the general principles. The most basic one is: \"Any action taken to reduce the terrorist use of the Internet must comply with national and European laws and regulation, and respect fundamental rights and freedoms, including access to the Internet, freedoms of assembly and expression, privacy and data protection\".\n\nThe Clean IT working method\n\nClean IT scheduled 6 meetings (in Amsterdam,Madrid,Brussels,Berlin,Utrecht,Vienna) and a final presentation. Discussions from each meeting are processed into a draft document. Each meeting results in a new version of the draft document, which is published on the Clean IT website and open for consultation to the public. The procedure followed entails five steps of drafting:\n\n4. New version of the document drafted and checked with all participants (by project team)\n\n5. Publication of new version of the draft document (open consultation).\n\nAnd after each meeting this cycle begins again. Steps 2 and 3 are carried out in a Clean IT meeting, which takes place once every 2 to 3 months. In the end, the draft document will be the definitive end product of the project, containing both the general principles as well as the best practices.\n\nThe meeting participants are invited personally and selected with a balanced representation in mind of: Law enforcement agencies, policy makers, non-governmental organizations, academics, Internet industry, technological industry and end users. The Clean IT project team will respect the situation where participants do not want to make their attendance public. A list of participants agreeing to publication of their (company) name can be found on our Partners and Participants page."}
{"text":"Wireless Security\n\nWith new and dangerous malware infecting our computers every day, there's now a potent argument for cyber security measures that use data and insight gleamed from past infections to help prevent new ones.\n\nReutersA lawsuit filed against Symantec Corp claims that the software maker seeks to persuade consumers to buy its products by scaring them with misleading information about the health of their computers.\n\nWhile new research highlights the potential use of smartphones as spying devices by intrepid code breakers, the technique of using accelerometers to keep track of keystrokes doesn't look that feasible in the real world.\n\nProductivity gains don't always coincide with employee preferences, but that's the case with increasing demands from workers to use their own personal devices at work.

{"text":"I just wish that the majority of 'hackers' were 'Intelligent students of Science', unfortunately the large majority are idiot 'script kiddies' utilizing the work of a small group of professional hackers, it is the script kiddies that provide the cover for professional hackers, purely down to the shear number of them , same as in chess a good player sacrifices the pawns.\n\nTake a professional safe cracker, maybe it would take him years to train up someone with absolutely no knowledge in safes, and ultimately their learning would be limited by their own ability.\n\nThe difference with the internet is that it takes absolutely no skill what soever because computer programs don't work in the same way as existing knowledge systems do. As long as you have half a brain and are able to download a script or program and then run it, it is the executing program that encompasses the knowledge of the original programmer rather than the moron pressing the start button, and therein lies the danger.\n\nWe are at a stage where 24\/7\/365 'bot' programs are continually patrolling network systems, and doing so completely unaided by humans. Within 15-20 minutes of any device being connected to the network, the programs start examining the interfaces for exploits, if an exploit is found the results are compiled into reports and then forwarded to human decision makers.\n\nUltimately the issue is 'traffic volume', the more traffic there is on the network , the harder they are to detect, when they are detected most are dealt with fairly quickly.\n\nSomeone said, there is no good or evil. Only perception makes it so. Though this wouldnt really fit into the overall social scheme of things, I think this brings to the fore the heart and soul of Hacking or Cracking. While, stealing\/robbing\/violating\/hurting\/killing people and destroying assets could easily be classified as evil by most, using a technical skill and hard gained knowledge to compete against and eventually defeat a system which tries to keep out the ignorant sounds more like a fun and challenge activity. Hackers are intelligent students of a science and just because they will termed being on the evil side of things, does not stop them from seeking satisfaction from their skills. The more skilled they are the more they are confident of their invincibilty. For them the entire thing is a game where they are competing with the individuals who designed and who mantain the security systems. And who knows, they might be the same people too! And yeah, no one became a skilled hacker because they had evil intentions to start with. People lie, cheat and steal when they realise they have become competent and powerful. Isnt it true for all walks of life and not just the internet?\n\nI remember when customer, inventory, and sales databases were standalone, and not accessible remotely, except by dial-in (the Internet hadn't been invented yet, at least not in the form we know it).\n\nI like to keep my most important information on computers that just don't connect to the Internet. Though that's not practical where you have to share information on a real-time basis over a wide area, it does solve a lot of problems.\n\nYes I agree that we have to take security very seriously. I heard that with the popularity of iphone, google have been hacking our privacy such that when we access our bank accounts it catches our passwords. That is so freaking scary. So does that mean that we cannot log in to banks or other important websites via 3G networks?\n\nI was in a law office the other day getting some contracts signed, tried to get network access to the internet, but the network was locked down tight....\n\nThat is until i went into the conference room and in a cupboard was a wireless router , with a strip of paper on top, giving all the Admin and user access settings.\n\nPrior to that I was watching a bank being fitted out, a small branch single floor. Now to save money on cables and infrastructure they had installed a wireless router in the secure area then used that to link the individual cashier terminals to the main computer.\n\nI made a mental note NEVER to use that particular bank.\n\nWith ineptitude at this level, you really do not need to be much of a hacker to gain access to sensitive computer systems.\n\nBut again we come back to the way people are, that they seem to think because they own a computer of a mobile phone that somehow they became computer experts, enabled to 'root' the systems and install all manner of unverified software, we see it now with the apple Iphone.\n\nIt's funny you brought up IBM. I remember taking a tour of an IBM wafer fab in 2000 and was surprised to learn then that they were using a WiFi network. That was about the time when the first WEP code was cracked (I did not diagnose the security wall at the plant) and so many users and businesses that had WiFi left them unlocked. I imagine IBM sure has learned a lot about security practices since then.\n\n\"Maybe Internet as biggest public and shared contents worldwide repository could have common guidelines on its government.\n\nUnited Nations Commission on Science andTechnology for Development (CSTD) has created past December 6th a working group on improvements to the Internet Governance Forum (IGF).\n\nCould this help on it or it is only a dream?\"\n\nPersonally I would say we need less bureaucrats sticking their noses in everything, on the whole the internet has done just fine without continual interference from the UN.\n\nThe one issue I do see with the Internet, is that for the fist time mankind is putting its reliance in technology that cannot be reliably archived in the centuries to come.\n\nThat is to say you can go digging in Egypt or Greece and find reliable remnants of a civilizations past learning we are now getting past that stage, at some time in the future if there was an 'event' that seriously impacted the infrastructure resulting in its destruction, then mankind would truly be set back further than the dark ages.\n\nNone of the learning or technology would be available. (remember 1 dead battery in your mobile phone ,brings your whole communication network crashing down), this will be the issue that dictates our future.\n\nOpenness adds value to the internet, both for service providers and users. An example of a middle ground between heavy restrictions and complete access is a gated community model.\n\nSocial networks like Facebook are a good example of this on the application layer: if you have credentials, you're in. Applying this principle to the network layer, so that a server only recognizes certain IP address, could thwart most denial-of-service attacks guidance"}

{"text":"from the it-is-possible dept\n\nYou may recall the story that got a lot of press earlier this month about the bank robber who, rather creatively used Craigslist to enlist a bunch of unwitting conspirators. He put up a day labor job ad, telling anyone interested to show up at a particular corner (in front of a bank) dressed in a very specific manner (blue shirt, safety goggles, dayglo work vest) where they would find out what work they were expected to do. Instead, the guy robbed the bank dressed in the same manner, and left police confused as they saw a bunch of folks who met the description of the bank robber.\n\nHowever, it appears that the guy has now been caught, as police used some good old fashioned detective work to figure out his identity -- relying on witness clues and DNA evidence. While the method of his getaway seems intriguing, what may be even more worthy of note is that the guy posted the original Craigslist ad using an open WiFi, believing that would help him avoid getting caught. Over the past few years, we've heard time and time again law enforcement officials complain and fret about open WiFi being a criminals' best friend, because it meant a criminal could do whatever they want and never get caught. Yet, as we've seen time and time and time again, such criminals can often be tracked down via other means.\n\nYes, it's true that an open WiFi network makes it more difficult to track down the criminal, but we don't live in a world where criminals are expected to leave a calling card everywhere they go either. Instead, we expect police to do a variety of detective work. A guy who walks into a bank with a ski mask isn't identifiable by his face, but the police look at other clues. In the same way, a criminal who uses open WiFi isn't identifiable via his IP address, but police look at other clues.

I think it took a week to make sure that we had, at least what we thought was enough information that was credible at the time before we made any announcements.\"\n\nHirai went on to say that hacking activities like the one his company endured threaten the very fabric of our society. He also said that Sony has not identified the person or persons that breached PlayStation Network. The company continues to work closely with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies around the world.\n\n\"Therefore it requires individuals and companies to be very vigilant, which goes without saying, and we need help from various government, various enforcement agencies and legislation in certain instances as well.\"\n\nAnyone notice that the help being sought doesn't even have anything to do with actual security?\n\nWhat can government, third-party agencies and law do to protect you when you don't even know how to secure your own network?\n\nWell, at this point it IS a Microsoft or Sony issue -- because Sony's proven woefully incompetent at securing its network and MS hasn't (lately).

He's just a Suit making Suit-type comments that are ignorant and self-serving, nothing new.\n\nHacking is too general a term for him to say it is bad for society. look at booze. if abused, yes bad for society but in moderation, it is quite beneficial. hacking is the same thing, look at Lulzsec who hacked Nintendo non-maliciously and then told them how to fix it. like that old hacking movie Sneakers, there are good hackers and bad hackers - intention and context matter! Sony hates them all I guess, even the Robert Redford ones.\n\nSuch a blanket statement begs for a revision to something more specific. Certain types of hacking most certainly could disrupt the internet and the lives of the people & institutions of which it is an integral part. Imagine a world where your personal information was absolutely unsafe (I am not arguing that it ever was totally safe now) or where web content could never be trusted as being untouched by the hands of hackers. It would be like the entire internet was the PSN.\n\nOf course, the hacker defenders will come out and continue to try and equate Hackers with Robin Hood. It is still unfortunate how so many of these people seem unable or unwilling to accept that there really are hackers with less-than-altruistic motives.\n\nIt is still unfortunate how so many of these people seem unable or unwilling to accept that there really are hackers with less-than-altruistic motives.\n\nI don't know of anyone saying the people breaking into networks and stealing consumers' information are altruists.

There are plenty of folks who would happily refer to themselves as hackers but who are ethical and who do not condone computer attacks. They resent the current use of the term \"hacker\" and their argument isn't that there are no bad people out there -- it's that those people aren't hackers, they're crackers"}

{"text":"As worms like Conficker steal headlines and get picked up by mainstream media, do you see organizations getting smarter and protecting their networks?\n\nWhat we see first of all is that the cyber criminals are getting better at protecting their botnets. That's a logical development which is providing new challenges for the security community. However I'm not that sure that legitimate businesses are learning at the same pace. A lot of the Conficker epidemic could have been prevented if ISPs had taken better care to protect the consumer networks.\n\nAlso the current economic situation is not helping, with businesses trying to cut costs. However in that regard I think that most businesses will have reconsidered any security budget cut after getting hit by Conficker. Overall it may have improved things a bit in the bigger companies, but not so much in the smaller. I think it's regular business. Businesses getting hit with malware will try to improve, businesses not hit will think they are doing alright. For businesses it doesn't matter if a threat is called Conficker or Agent, they simply don't want to get infected.\n\nWhere do you see the current security threats your products are guarding against in 5 years from now? What kind of evolution do you expect?\n\nThat is actually extremely hard to predict. To make an accurate statement about it you need to factor in a lot of different things. Where will the internet be by then? Will there be involvement and responsiveness from law enforcement and if so, how much? And so on.\n\nIn any case the threats will go where the money is. In five years mobile banking will be very standard and therefore we will see a lot of malware for mobile devices.

Overall a lot will depend on how well law enforcement will be able to track down cyber criminals all across the"}

{"text":"Hacking Authority:\nTeens Negotiating Acceptable Use in School Computing\nAbstract\nIn the context of growing global reliance on networked computers, the\nnegative impact of malicious computer\nhacking, or cracking, is increasing in speed and magnitude. While\ncorporations can allocate significant resources to\nnetwork security, government agencies, schools, and not-for-profit\norganizations struggle to protect sensitive\ninformation from malicious attacks. Noting that preventive\nethics-based education of young computer-users is\nlargely absent from the discourse of network security strategy, the\nauthor argues that the dearth of ethics-based\ncomputing curriculum, policies, and procedures causes schools to\ninadvertently function as training grounds for\nyoung crackers. Tight public education budgets and inadequate\ntechnical training for school staff members lead\neducators to implement policies, procedures, and pedagogical methods\nthat teach computer-proficient students the\nvalue and practice of ethical computing. The article describes\nresults of an ethnographic study of the ways in which\nstaff at a public high school attempted, using various strategies, to\ninvest students in protecting network security on\ncampus.\nGrowing global reliance on networked computers has increased the\nimpact of malicious network hacking, or\ncracking. While government agencies and corporations have focused\nsubstantial organizational resources and\nrhetoric on legalization and implementation of heightened\nsurveillance of networks, pursuit and prosecution of\ncriminals, and recovery of data, the dearth of preventative policy\nand program development indicates an overlooked\nbut crucial component of a national strategy to prevent and reduce\ncracking. In this article I develop the argument\nthat policy makers must address the need for ethical computing\nstrategies and policies at the K-12 level designed to\nacculturate young computer hackers away from cracking and toward\nethical computing. Using the case of New\nTechnology High School, a U.S. Department of Education Demonstration\nSite public school in Napa, California,\nthis article describes a three-year long participant observer\nethnographic study of the successes and failures\nassociated with the school's attempt to socialize its hacker students\nto act as ethical and invested citizens in a\nnetworked environment.\nThe Cost of Network Attacks\nCrimes committed using computers include those that are unique to\ncomputers and those that criminals have\nadapted for perpetration over international computer networks. A\nlarge portion of computer crime can be understood\nas new iterations of crimes that predate personal computers and the\nInternet. Fraud, piracy, identity theft, credit card\ntheft, insider trading, and child pornography distribution are\nexamples of pre-PC era crimes that are now frequently\nperpetrated via computer networks. Certain features of the Internet,\nincluding instant communication, relative\nanonymity, and international scope, have enabled criminals to commit\ncrimes more easily and with greater gain.\nAcquiring money and goods with little effort is the primary goal of\nsuch crimes (Goslar, 2000).\nThe second category of computer crime includes crimes unique to\nnetworked computer environments. These\ncrimes include denial-of-service attacks, data destruction, Trojan\nattacks, password theft, slave platforming, graffiti,\nemail-borne viruses, firewall attacks, and syn-flood attacks. Rather\nthan financial gain, what typically motivates the\nindividuals who commit such crimes is thrill-seeking; learning new\ntricks; seeking the opportunity to show off\nskills; becoming part of an exclusive community; taunting authority;\nand enacting David vs. Goliath scenarios\n(Goslar, 2000). Because these intrusions are often little more than\npranks, they exist in contrast to the blatantly\ncriminal \"hard-core\" computer crimes mentioned earlier.\nIn some cases the pranks are labeled \"hacktivism,\" such as\npolitically-motivated graffiti on corporate web\nsites that challenges the ideology of the company. For example, in\nSeptember 2000 a hacktivist defaced the OPEC\nweb with commentary including the statement, \"I think I speak for\neveryone out there \u2026 when I say you guys need\nto get your collective asses in gear with the price of crude\" (as\nquoted in Knight, 2000). In another case, a selfdescribed\ntagger nicknamed \"Nemesystm\" tagged sites such as the U.S. Navy\nPatrol Squadron's with his lyrical\npoetry (Lemos, 2000b). Scholar and cyber-liberties activist Doug\nRushkoff reports experiencing guilty pleasure\nwhen they hear of hacktivist attacks, reveling in the subversive,\nanti-hegemonic flavor of the pranks, viewing them\nas fleeting reminders of the fact that the Internet was originally\ndeveloped with public funds and therefore rightfully\nbelongs to all citizens (Rushkoff, 2000).\nThe tolerance of ideological hacking is expected to wane as more\ncitizens go on-line more frequently and are\nconsequently affected by network slow-downs and site unavailability\ncaused by hacktivists and others. Civil\nlibertarians and privacy advocates, who cherish the remaining open,\nfree-wheeling \"new frontier\" remnants of the\nInternet, have argued that increased publicity of attacks will result\nin tighter government regulation and increased\nsurveillance of citizens' Internet activities in the name of national\nsecurity (United Press International, 2000). In\nfact, in September, 2000 European and U.S. officials were finalizing\nthe world's first international cybercrime\ntreaty, which would require countries to allow police and government\nagencies significant leeway in search and\nseizure of computers and networks, despite strenuous objections from\nprivacy advocates (Gruenwald, 2000).\nHackers fear that unless the hacker\/hacktivist community moves\naggressively toward self-regulation,\nincluding the reining-in of \"script kiddies\" (young, unskilled\ncrackers) and those who write tools for them, corporate\nand public pressure to crack down on hackers will result in a\nwitch-hunt. Old-guard hackers and network security\nadministrators who work toward responsible network use, so-called\n\"white hat\" hackers, have admonished those\n\"black hat\" hackers who disclose security holes to the public and\neven create and distribute tools to allow script\nkiddies to exploit the holes (Lemos, 2000c). Until self-regulation is\nvisibly effective in deterring network attacks,\nbusinesses and government agencies will continue to advocate\nincreased restrictions.\nE-commerce businesses and government agencies have reacted to\ndestructive computer network attacks by\ncalling for and attempting to implement tighter security measures and\nmore serious punishments for criminal attacks\nagainst computer networks. Business leaders fear the lower profits\nthat could result because of loss of consumer\nconfidence in e-commerce and computer network security in general\n(Robinson, 2000). This fear appears to be wellfounded,\naccording to a recent poll commissioned by the Information Technology\nAssociation of America which\nfound that four out of five respondents doubted the U.S. government's\nability to keep computers secure (Reuters,\n2000a). According to the head of the National Security Agency Lt.\nGen. Michael Hayden, even non-malicious\nhacker break-ins cause great damage to public confidence, forcing the\nNSA to redouble efforts to protect ecommerce\nas well as military networks (Reuters, 2000b). The threat to\ne-commerce is well-publicized in part\nbecause businesses and commercial networks are the most common\ntargets of both hacktivists and crackers\n(Rushkoff, 2000). In addition, companies are increasingly willing to\nattach large dollar figures to their prevention\nand recovery efforts, knowing that such publicity will bolster the\nargument for legalizing more surveillance and\ntighter restrictions on Internet use. Loss of productivity caused by\ncracking has thus far resulted in billions of\ndollars' worth of damage worldwide (Biagi, 2000), with a predicted\ncost of $1.6 trillion for the year 2000 (Goslar,\n2000).\nThe private sector and government agencies have focused\norganizational resources on improved network\nsurveillance, better recovery of data, vigorous prosecution, and\nharsher punishment. Corporations are able to\nallocate significant resources to network security. American\ncompanies spent $4.2 billion in 1999 for security\nsoftware alone, with a predicted increase to $7.4 billion by 2002\n(Koerner & Glasser, 2000). Despite the large\nmonetary investment in security software, such software catches only\nattacks by unskilled crackers. The recent highprofile\nattacks wrought by script kiddies who used unsophisticated,\noff-the-shelf attack programs are examples of\nthe type of attack that security software is designed to detect\n(Taylor, 2000a). Highly-skilled security administrators\nare necessary to detect and trace more sophisticated attacks, and\neven so most high-level attacks go unsolved (Koch,\n2000).\nWorkers with network security skills are in critically short supply,\ntypically leaving the military and other\nfederal agencies, where they received training, for more lucrative\nprivate sector positions (Bajaj, 2000). Even though\nnetwork security workers' average annual salary increased 11.47% from\nthe previous year (Fujii, 2000), the\ndisparity between federal and private salary scales for security\nadministrators is striking: entry level workers with\nthe government earn at most $30,000 per year, compared to the $90,000\nto $120,000 earned in the private sector\n(United Press International, 2000). The increasing demand in the\nprivate sector for skilled security experts forces\ngovernment agencies, schools, and other not-for-profit organizations\nto compete in vain with the escalating salaries\nand stock option packages that private sector companies offer to\nskilled security administrators (Bajaj, 2000).\nThe inability of the government to compete for workers is\nunfortunate, since arguably the national defenserelated\nnetworks are the United States' resource most in need of protection.\nGovernment agencies are concerned\nabout network attacks due to the possibility of unauthorized access\nto and manipulation of secret government\ninformation systems, including military systems. The current\nrethinking of the very parameters of national security\nis in part due to the threat of computer sabotage (Matthews, 2000).\nHowever, the inability to compete with\ncorporations for workers has lead to serious gaps in the government's\nnetwork security. A recent congressional\ninvestigation of federal agencies' readiness to repel network\ninfiltration netted an overall grade of D-, indicating the\nhigh level of vulnerability throughout government networks (House\nSubcommittee on Government Management,\nInformation, and Technology, 2000). Growing concern about network\nvulnerability lead President Clinton to\npropose a plan to spend $2 billion to protect national\ninfrastructure-related computer networks (United Press\nInternational, 2000).\nAmong the efforts to combat malicious attacks are an increasing\nnumber of \"counterhacking\" education\ncourses available. While higher education has been slow to catch on\nto the need for high-level network security\ntraining (Bajaj, 2000), private companies such as EDS, Foundstone,\nand Ernst & Young have begun to offer courses\nwith names like \"Extreme Hacking\" which train corporate employees to\nhack into their own networks in order to\nbetter protect them. However, hackers such as Emmanuel Goldstein,\neditor of the hacker publication 2600, assert,\n\"corporations can't teach hacking\" (Taylor, 2000b). According to\nGoldstein, \"[hacking] has to be in you\" (Taylor,\n2000b), implying that even when corporations attempt to teach\ntechnical skills, employees will still lack the innate\nsensibility necessary to think like a hacker. This observation\nsuggests that if white hat hackers, civil libertarians,\nbusiness leaders, and government agencies believe in the importance\nof acculturating computer-proficient\nindividuals toward responsible computing, such acculturation must\nbegin early. K-12 educational institutions\nprovide an opportunity for such acculturation to occur.\nSchools as Hacker Training Grounds\nSince Jeffersonian times, the public school has functioned as the\nprimary means of educating U.S. citizens to\nlive and work in participatory democracy (Botstein, 1997). While the\novert curriculum (defined as the easily\nobservable portions of the curriculum such as course offerings,\nsyllabi, and assignments) plays a major role in\nstudents' academic education, the covert curriculum (school policies\nand procedures, social activities, etc.) is crucial\nin acculturating students to understand and learn to function within\nthe social and economic hierarchies outside\nschool walls (McAllister & McAllister, 1998). As networked,\nInternet-connected personal computers become\ncommon in public schools, computer-related covert curriculum becomes\nan important yet understudied factor in the\neducational programs of U.S. youth.\nHackers, crackers, hacktivists, and script kiddies typically first\nlearn and hone their computer skills at school,\nwhere they usually have access to multiple networked computers with\nlittle security software blocking their\nexperimentation. School is also often where they first encounter a\ncommunity of like-minded peers. Whether\nstudents' curiosity and passion is directed toward white hat ethical\ncomputing or toward black hat cracking depends\nupon the school environment, including computer-related curriculum,\npolicies, and procedures. Understanding the\nimpact of pedagogical models employed by schools on the ethics\neducation and acculturation of young hackers is\nvital to maintaining a balance between network security and the\nprotection of citizens' Internet civil liberties.\nThe constructivist theory of pedagogy, developed and championed by\nscholars including Dewey (1897),\nBruner (1966), Piaget (1972), and Papert and Harel (1993), is a\ntheory in which students are conceptualized as active\ncreators of their own ideas and meaning, rather than as empty vessels\nto be filled with knowledge by the professor.\nLearning can only take place when students relate new information to\ncognitive structures that exist in their minds.\nAn emphasis on integrating theory with practice via learning by doing\nreplaces rote memorization of facts because it\nis through actively working with material, with peers or alone, that\nstudents solidify their understanding on a deep\ncognitive level.\nConstructivists who advocate educational technology believe in freely\nusing flexible productivity tools such\nas programming, word processing, spreadsheet, database, art, and\nanimation software to enable teachers and students\nto tailor their computer use to their particular needs. The goal for\ntoday's constructivists is to move away from\nlecture-based instruction and multiple-choice testing, and instead\nengage students in \"project-based learning\" where\nstudents are more closely connected to \"real world\" concerns as they\nwork independently and in teams to define\nproblems, figure out what tools and resources they need to find and\nanalyze pertinent information (beyond the\ntextbook and the teacher), and come up with feasible solutions. The\nskills of these \"free range students\" (Conte,\n1995) closely match what corporations say they desire in employees\n(team work, problem-solving, etc.). Among the\nskills the students are learning is how to use computer technology\nresponsibly with minimal or no supervision.\nBecause schools have stepped up use of Internet-connected computers,\nthe issue of protecting network\nsecurity as well as preventing student access to inappropriate\non-line material has been an increasingly pressing\nconcern for school staff. Most schools, lacking trained network\nsecurity staff, opt for Internet content management\n(ICM) measures, such as off-the-shelf filtering software and proxy\nservers, as a stopgap measure. A May 1999\nreport by Quality Education Data estimated that usage of ICM software\nin K-12 schools would increase to 71.5% in\nthe 1999-2000 school year over the 52.5% of U.S. school districts\nthat used ICM in the 1998-1999 school year\n(Burt, 2000). As noted earlier, such software catches only the\nsimplest of network intrusions and abuses while\nfailing to detect or deter more sophisticated attacks.\nOften school staff members lack even the most basic understanding of\ntypes of hacks, leaving them unable to\ndiscriminate between harmless, potentially harmful, and malicious\ncomputing. One high school student was\nreprimanded by school officials for malicious hacking when he\nreported a security hole he found in the school's\npassword system. Another teenager, who thought his classroom\ncomputer's Netscape settings were configured\nincorrectly, was reported for hacking by a student aide when he was\nsimply looking at the browser settings (Lemos,\n2000a). Incidents like these can lead student hackers to feel a sense\nof disillusionment and distrust of school officials\nwhen their efforts to help are unheeded or even punished.\nICM use teaches hacker and non-hacker students, in a covert way, that\nthey cannot be trusted to use\ncomputers responsibly. Furthermore, it teaches students that school\nstaff member do not deem students capable of\nlearning to use computers responsibly. Not only does the use of ICMs\ncontradict the goals of constructivist\npedagogy, but such measures also represent an irresistible challenge\nfor hacker students who view network\nrestrictions imposed by school officials as an opportunity to\ndemonstrate their hacking prowess to their peer group\nwhile simultaneously subverting institutional authority. Public\nschools that are unprepared to handle network\nsecurity have few workable options for addressing the need to control\nthe actions of hacker students. The following\nsection of the article describes a school at which school staff\nmembers gave up trying to control hacker students,\ninstead opting to harness and channel their passion and talent toward\nhelping the school as white hat hackers.\nThe Study Site\nNew Technology High School (NTHS) in Napa, California, opened its\ndoors to 220 juniors and seniors in the\nfall of 1996. It was a public magnet school that featured\nproject-based, integrated curriculum; constant access to\nnetworked, Internet-connected computers; and a school culture and\nphysical environment modeled upon that of a\nhigh tech start-up business. I conducted participant observation data\nfrom 1996 \u2013 1999 while serving as the\nMultimedia Instructor at the school. Sites of investigation included\nschool databases, email exchanges, classroom\nobservations, student-staff meeting observations, staff meeting\nobservations, and personal interviews with students\nand staff (Van Buren, 1999).\nNTHS students were required to meet Napa Valley Unified School\nDistrict (NVUSD) graduation\nrequirements, including reading District-approved novels and\ntextbooks, in addition to NTHS-specific requirements\nin subjects that NTHS staff members deemed beneficial for college and\ncareer success in the Information Age, such\nas computer applications and new media design. Proficiency in word\nprocessing, spreadsheet, database, and\npresentation software served as a foundation for other courses at the\nschool; similarly, interactive multimedia design\nskill was crucial during students' careers at NTHS because many\nteachers required students to create interactive\nmultimedia presentations. Students could either take all their\nclasses at NTHS or spend part of their day at the other\nhigh schools or the local college taking courses not offered at NTHS\nsuch as marching band, chorus, and sports.\nStudents were required to complete at least four college classes and\ncomplete work experience\/internship hours in\norder to graduate. Curriculum is academically rigorous; students\nreported they work much harder at NTHS than they\ndid at their previous high schools (New Technology High School, 1997).\nTo attend NTHS students needed a 2.0 GPA or higher and must have\npassed Algebra I. The moderate GPA\nrequirement indicated the desire of NTHS staff to attract a broad\nrange of students, from Advanced Placement\nstudents to those who had failed to thrive in traditional schools.\nQualified students were required to attend an\ninformational meeting about the school with their parents or\nguardians. Students who did not meet the entrance\nrequirements may enter an appeals process and gain admission after\nwriting an essay and participating in a 30-\nminute panel interview with a committee of adults. In 1997-98, the\nNTHS student body was more ethnically diverse\nthan at Napa's comprehensive high schools, with NTHS reporting 40%\nstudents of color vs. 36% and 24% at the\nother schools (California Department of Education, 1997). Sixty-three\npercent of NTHS students were male, a\npercentage disproportionate to the population at large.\nThe cultural environment of NTHS was that of a super-democratic\ninstitution where students were\nencouraged and empowered to speak, rabble-rouse, and cooperatively\nshape decisions including disciplinary\npolicies. School planners hoped that a tremendously open environment,\nincluding the interior architecture of the\nbuilding and the structure of the information network, would\nencourage students to feel enfranchised within the\nschool's structure. The atmosphere at NTHS was one of openness,\nvigorous discussion, freedom of mobility,\nresponsibility to others, and high visibility at all times. Students\nat NTHS were actively socialized to make wellreasoned\ndemands of the school staff and other students, with the expectation\nthat institutional changes would occur\nbased on their demands.\nStudents and staff were recruited based on overt use of the high-tech\nbusiness metaphor. Because the school\nsought \"to prepare students to excel in an information-based,\ntechnologically advanced society\" (New Technology\nHigh School, 1996) the school used high-tech business models whenever\nappropriate to form policy and make\ndecisions. Rather than implement a multitude of restrictive policies,\nstaff members kept rules to a minimum while\nemphasizing education about appropriate technology use and\nresponsibility to the organization. Students were\nsystematically invited to participate in policy discussions and\ndecision-making and were expected to behave as\nresponsible adults. The school did not use bells to prompt students\nto go to class; instead students were expected to\nbe responsible for their own timeliness. Students did not have to\nraise their hands to ask permission to get a drink of\nwater or go to the bathroom\u2014they could come and go as they needed\nunless they abused the privilege.\nComputer use at NTHS fit precisely within the constructivist model of\ntechnology implementation. The\nschool's open and unrestricted model of computer use was a major\nfeature of the attempt to implement a \"high tech\nbusiness model\" at the school. Planners distinguished the NTHS high\ntech business model as one in which workers\nwere trusted to get their work done and act responsibly on-line. In\nsuch open, trusting high-tech start up\nenvironments, use of Internet filters and other computer restrictions\nwould destroy the corporate culture of openness,\ncamaraderie, creativity, and innovation. Pedagogy focused on teaching\nstudents that they were in control of their\ncomputers and could manipulate the hardware and software in order to\nachieve academic goals. Computer hardware\nand software products were high-quality, ample, and kept up-to-date\nby the school's sponsors. Students and staff had\naccess to about 250 networked Pentium-chip PCs which meant that\nstudents always had access to a computer when\nrequired. The software used was business-grade software since a\nprimary goal at the school was to prepare students\nfor the workplace. Students had unfiltered access to email and the\nWorld Wide Web (WWW) and used their\ncomputers for research, database discussion, document retrieval, and\ncreation of school-related essays, journals,\nresearch papers, and multimedia projects. Not all use of NTHS\ncomputers is academic, however. Some students\nformed a Games Club and met outside of instructional time to play\nstaff-approved computer games. During breaks\nand after class students could use the computers for email and WWW\nbrowsing as long as their use complied with\nthe District's Appropriate Use agreement.\nTeachers used computers to post course information and assignments in\ndatabases and on the WWW, email\nstudents their grades and comments on school work, record and\ncalculate grades in grading software, perform\nresearch for curriculum development, and develop and deliver class\npresentations and lectures. Students and staff\nused the computer network to arrange meetings and check schedules,\nshare important school-wide announcements,\nand collaborate on projects by circulating files. According to\nconstructivist ideals for technology use, NTHS\nexemplified a best practices model in the way that students learn to\nresponsibly control and access computer\ntechnology.\nThe Computer Network Structure\nAs long as the trend of incorporating computer technology into school\ncurricula continues, the U.S. public\neducation system will increasingly be forced to grapple with the\nfollowing issues faced at NTHS during the study.\nThe description and analysis of the impact of computer use on the\ncovert curriculum revealed that, first, substantial\nstaff and student time was diverted from academic curriculum and\ninstruction because of student misuse and abuse\nof the computers and computer network. Second, the disciplinary\nsystem held different lessons for less-computer\nproficient students than it did for highly-computer proficient\nstudents, creating separate classes of students within\nthe high-tech school environment. Third, although technology abuse as\na type of school crime is laughable to most\nofficials from traditional schools, at NTHS it constituted a constant\nstruggle against high-tech abuse that, as noted\nearlier, American law enforcement officials believe constitutes a\nthreat to the stability of the U.S. economy and\nsecurity.\nMaintaining the stability and functionality of the NTHS computer\nnetwork for instructional use demanded\nthat control of network functions was restricted, albeit minimally.\nAccidental or purposeful changes in the network\ncould have resulted in network crashes, disrupted and lost\ninstructional time, and extra hours of work for teachers\nand the network manager. Even with software-based restrictions,\nteachers and other staff members had to visually\nmonitor student use of computer technology and educate students about\nappropriate use, adding to the already-full\nworkloads of staff. NTHS staff members dealt with diversions from\nacademics common to all schools due to typical\nschool activities (assemblies, rallies) and traditional disciplinary\nactivities (referrals for smoking, 'defiance'), and\nother miscellaneous problems such as forgotten textbooks or school\nsupplies. These traditional school diversions\ncombined with the unique technology-related diversions at NTHS\nresulted in an increase in personnel time required\nto run the school and loss of instructional time for students.\nContrary to the myth that computers are labor-saving\ndevices that save educational dollars, at NTHS the computers added to\npersonnel costs. The minimal software-based\ncontrol of the network and individual computers that the school chose\nto implement, as described below, helped only\na small extent to lessen staff workload.\nStudent access to the school network was restricted by individual\npasswords, administered by the school's\nnetwork manager. No passwords, student or staff, were secret from\nher. Students had two passwords: one for\nlogging on to the network, and another for accessing their Lotus\nNotes accounts. They could log on to any computer\nin the building and access their individual \"My Documents\" folders\nhoused on a school server and their Lotus Notes\nfiles housed on a different server, giving them a high degree of\nfreedom and flexibility in moving about the building\nthroughout the day. Thanks to the World Wide Web, students and staff\ncould also access their Lotus Notes email\nfrom outside the school by entering their usernames and passwords at\nthe school's web site.\nUsing the C-drives of individual workstations for saving files was\ndiscouraged (but not prohibited) since the\nC-drives were accessible to other students, making files vulnerable\nto alteration or erasure. In addition to their own\npassword-protected folders on the school servers, students had read\nand write access to other partitioned sections of\nschool servers, such as the Students on Server3 section (where\nteachers and some administrative staff maintained\nfolders) and the WebServer on Server3 (where students posted their\nweb page folders for the school web site).\nStudents could use those publicly-accessible servers to view, post,\nand copy files for staff and each other, but\nstudents could not alter or delete files once they were posted in\nthese public areas of the network.\nWhen the school first opened, staff members were very na\u010fve about the\npossible mischief and damage\nstudents could cause when they had unrestricted access to the\ncomputers and network. Computer-related discipline\nproblems were simply outside the consciousness of staff members. Our\ninitial expectation was that we would face\ntraditional disciplinary issues that public schools faced; we never\nconsidered the possibility that students would\nabuse the privilege of their access to high technology. Exacerbating\nthe problem of unpreparedness was that staff\nlacked training in network security. For example, when the school\nopened students had DOS access, but the network\nmanager soon encountered problems maintaining the functionality of\nthe network and individual computers because\nof students who tampered with system settings.\nNTHS staff members acknowledged that due to limited time, resources,\nand expertise we could not hope to\ncompletely control the school's computer network, especially since\nsome NTHS students possessed far superior\ncomputer skills than all NTHS staff put together. As a result the\nstaff tried to enfranchise all students in the process\nof building effective computer technology policy. Working from the\ndesire to build a \"culture of trust\" with\nstudents, staff members began by trusting students to use the network\nresponsibly and educating them about how to\nuse the network responsibly.\nEventually the staff realized that despite the effort to build a\nculture of trust, the school would have been\nnegligent if staff members did not monitor student computer use at\nall. Staff members attempted to minimize the\nneed for monitoring by preventive education. All students and their\nparents or guardians read and signed the\nschool's \"Appropriate Use Policy\" which detailed the school's\ncomputer policies and procedures. Staff members\nrepeatedly reminded students that the whole world was watching the\nschool's progress, and students should conduct\nthemselves as if the world was looking over their shoulders. Students\nhad been invited twice in the first three years\nof the school's operation (1996-1999) to help develop the school\ntechnology policy. Known and potential hacker\nstudents were repeatedly invited to serve as network consultants and\ntroubleshooters, performing such white hattype\ntasks as helping to plug network security holes and assist in the\nformulation of network policy and procedures.\nTeachers and staff members actively socialized students to view the\ntechnology resources as privileges they enjoyed\nrather than resources to which they were entitled. We frequently\nreminded students that the computers and networks\nwere owned by the school district, and that school facilities were\nfor educational use only.\nThe monitoring at NTHS was minimal. Teachers looked at students'\ncomputer monitors in the course of\nwalking around to help students, watching for signs of inappropriate\nactivities. The network manager installed a\nprogram on each computer that tracked installation of applications by\ncomparing what was installed on the machine\nat last start-up to what was installed on the machine at the current\nstart-up. When new applications were noted the\nmanager was able, as her busy schedule allowed, to look at the log-on\nrecords and see who was last logged on to that\nparticular computer, indicating who installed the software without\npermission. Students were aware that staff could\nread their email and track web site visitation, as well as read\npostings on the various discussion databases that the\nschool offered.\nEven the minimal network restrictions in place at NTHS have incensed\nthe school's more computer-proficient\nstudents. Accustomed to having complete control over their home\ncomputers (and in some cases, home computer\nnetworks), such students arrive at NTHS expecting to have similar\ncontrol over school computers. This caused\ncomputer-proficient students to complain bitterly, eventually driving\nthem underground to constantly and\nsurreptitiously test the network for holes in security. However,\nstudents were also aware that the staff was so busy\nwith curriculum development, teaching, research, staff development\nand training, student tutoring, discipline,\nparent-student conferences, staff meetings, grading, preparing for\nconference presentations, and other duties that we\nrarely had time to monitor student use of the network. The times that\nI caught students misusing or abusing the\ncomputer network were entirely by accident and in person (for\nexample, I happened to walk by a student's\nworkstation and see the \"download file\" window open on the monitor,\nor see an email with obscene language),\nrather than because of systematic electronic monitoring.\nNon-Proficient Students\nThe less-computer proficient students appeared for the most part to\nfollow the appropriate use guidelines\nestablished through the \"culture of trust\" campaign. Although they\noccasionally misused email, the Web, and\ndatabases by engaging in social\/recreational use during class time,\nand were punished accordingly, they did not\nattempt to penetrate or bypass network security blocks or damage the\nsystem. Low-level abuse of the network was\neasily discovered and traced by school staff, leading non-proficient\nstudents to fear being caught. As a result, nonproficient\nstudents learned to fear monitoring and punishment.\nThe definition of appropriate use of email, discussion databases, and\nsoftware of various kinds involved\nrefraining from activities that will damage the school's culture,\nreputation, or network. Students were not allowed to\ncreate sexist, racist, homophobic, obscene, or otherwise harassing\nmessages using words, images, or sounds.\nStudents were not to send large files over email in order to avoid\noverloading and crashing the email system.\nStudents were not to use the network recreationally during\ninstructional time, i.e. sending social email or social\ndatabase postings during class time, unless they have finished their\nassignments. These limitations were in keeping\nwith the \"business model,\" since similar limitations were in place in\nvarious businesses to avoid lost productivity\nand harassment lawsuits. Knowing that students more readily accepted\nlimitations if the limitations are framed in\nterms of \"business standards,\" teachers periodically discussed recent\ncases in which a worker was fired for viewing\npornography at work, or for sending harassing email from an\nemployer's computer network. That the limitations on\ncomputer use also kept NTHS within the California Educational Code\nguidelines pertaining to the maintenance of an\nappropriate educational environment was rarely discussed with students.\nControlling appropriate use of student email proved difficult. The\nexistence of email groups in the school\nemail address database allowed standard messages to reach large\ngroups of people quickly and easily. These groups\ninclude \"Staff,\" \"Junior Students,\" \"Senior Students,\" and\n\"Students.\" Teachers were able to make email address\ngroups for their classes. For example, I could send email to my\nstudents, period by period, regarding assignments\nand multimedia contests. Students quickly realized the power of being\nable to send a message to a large group of\npeople. On the second day the school was open in 1996, which was the\nfirst day that students' email accounts were\nfunctional, a student sent an all-student email containing a picture\nof a skull-and-crossbones with the message\n\"Death to all students.\" Because no staff members were on the\n\"Student\" email group, we did not know of the\nmessage until recipients complained to us about the message as a\ndeath threat. The sender of the email, who claimed\nthat the message was a joke, was immediately called into the school\ndirector's office and sent back to his previous\nhigh school. After this incident staff members were included in all\nofficial student group email address lists, and\nstudents were required to secure and note staff member permission\nwhen sending all-student email (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Example of Permissible All-Student Email, 1999\nFROM: Amanda (5\/27\/99)\nTO: Students\nSUBJECT: Raffle\nAttention Students!

Come home soon.\nYour Hot Latin Lover,\nFidel\nThis policy did not address what was possible due to the\nproliferation of web sites that offered anonymous\nemail accounts. Sites such as hushmail.com, china.com, and\nlatinmail.com allowed anyone to establish an email\naccount under a name of their choice. For students and others who\nwished to send anonymous email to people\nwithin the school, such sites offered the power to communicate\nwithout responsibility for the message. In May, 1999\nthe school suffered a rash of anonymous all-student emails (Figure\n2), mostly innocuous in nature with one that was\nboth threatening and vulgar. Two of the messages contained large\nquantities of text that when sent to every student\nin the school could clog the email server to the extent that the\nserver might crash. One email was sent by someone\nwho managed to create a fake school email account\n(\"[log in to unmask]\"). This and one other email\ncontain bogus dates, indicating that the sender deliberately changed\nthe date and time on the sending computer to\nmake the prank more elaborate. The existence of numerous web sites\nthat offered anonymous email meant that even\nif NTHS moved to block mail from a specific email account or even a\nspecific provider, a student bent on sending\nanonymous emails could simply switch account providers over and over again.\nDespite the relatively benign nature of these anonymous messages,\nthey nonetheless sent a sobering message\nto the school, particularly to school staff. The senders wished to\nremind us of the school's vulnerability. The emails\nannounced the power these people possess to subvert school rules with\nimpunity, as well the potential damage these\npeople could cause if they so desired. It was tempting to view these\nemail pranks as mere high school foolishness,\nbut there were unmistakable parallels between the NTHS incidents and\nother incidents of hacker tampering at the\ncorporate and governmental levels.\nIn response to the anonymous emails an NTHS teacher who also served\nas the school web site manager sent\nout an all-student email hoping to send the strong message that the\noffender(s) were jeopardizing the openness of the\nschool's information system:\nThe recent flood of outside e-mail is a good example of the problems\nof having an open\nnetwork. Although some students use outside e-mail accounts\nappropriately (to send\nthemselves assignments from home, etc.) a few students who misuse our\nweb access could\nforce us to tighten the network. It would take very little effort to\nput our access of the web\nthrough a proxy server which would limit access to sites the staff\npre-selects, or to remove the\ne-mail option for Lotus, or to use only the electronic library and\nremove all WWW access.\nThe rest of the nation is watching us to see if an open network can\nwork at a public school. As\nin any government structure or institution, unless each of us acts\nresponsibly and encourages\nothers to do the same, it will be much easier to remove liberties.\nThis summer, the staff will be making those decisions as we update\nour system for next year.!\nThe behavior of you and your peers during these last few weeks will\nbe fresh in our minds.! If\nyou agree with the staff that an open network is what we want, then\nplease use our network in\na professional manor [sic].\nIf you have any thoughts on the matter, please e-mail them to the\nTech Management Team (P.\nCurtis, personal communication, May 28, 1999).\nOne attempt at systematic electronic monitoring was quickly\nabandoned. In Fall 1998 a highly computerproficient\nstudent approached school staff with an idea for an electronic method\nof monitoring web site use on\ncampus. He proposed installing what is called a \"Unix box,\" which\nwould allow the constant and complete\nrecording of every web site visited by everyone in the building. The\nschool director and network manager agreed to\nlet him install the Unix box, and within the first 30 minutes of\ntracking, people in the building visited dozens of\nobviously inappropriate sex-related web sites. By noting the\ncomputers from which the sites were accessed and the\ntime of access, the network manager could then determine who was\nlogged on to the computers at the time of\naccess. Quickly the record of inappropriate site visitation became so\nstaggering that the school director removed the\nUnix box because he did not have time to discipline all the\ntransgressors. The director also noted that the Unix box,\nlike filtering software, contradicted his desire to build a \"culture\nof trust\" with students at the school. In this instance\nthe school chose to ignore the problem rather than reallocate time\nand resources to deal with the problem.\nHackers\nIn contrast to the activities and lessons learned by non-computer\nproficient students, hacker students, who\nclearly knew how to use computer technology much better than staff,\nscoffed at the school's policies and procedures\nand knew that they could move in and out of the school network and\nengage in other inappropriate computer activity\nwithout being detected.\nA group of three such students, all boys, agreed to be interviewed\nfor the study regarding what they knew was\npossible in the way of infiltrating the school's computer network and\nindividual computers. These boys expressed\ntheir views about hacking. For these boys the goal was to determine\nwhat security holes existed and what damage\nthey could do, but did not do, to the network. An additional thrill\nin the case of hacking the school system was the\nsecret knowledge of their technological superiority to the adult\nstaff members at NTHS. I approached them as\ninformants, carefully characterizing what I wanted to know as\nactivities they knew were possible, not necessarily\nactivities in which they themselves had engaged. Some of these\nstudents had already helped the school director plug\nsecurity holes in the school's network. Nevertheless, because the\nconversation could lead to disciplinary action by\nschool staff I protected their identities in order to understand the\nextent and nature of actual and potential computer\nsystem abuse at NTHS. What follows is a description of actual and\npotential transgressive computer activity at the\nschool gleaned from a personal interview with students.\nWhen asked to describe activities that students could engage in at\nschool that could potentially damage the\nschool computer system, the students' responses filled three\nhand-written pages of notes. Activities could be placed\ninto two categories: nuisance-producing activities and\nmaliciously-damaging activities. The activities could create\nphysical damage to computer hardware; software-based damage to\nindividual computers; and software-based\ndamage to the computer network as a whole. The cost of overcoming\nsuch damage ranged from the expenditure of\nsmall amounts of staff and instructional time and money to\nexpenditure of large amounts of staff and instructional\ntime and money. In the case of data loss the risk involved\nirreparable loss of student and staff privacy if confidential\ngrade, personnel, and address information is accessed.\nTheft of software and hardware was the first activity the students\nmentioned. Students can steal software\napplications by taking the actual disk or CD on which the licensed\nsoftware was delivered. They could also copy\nsoftware from school computers or download illegal copies of software\nposted at \"warez\" sites on the Internet.\nDownloading from the Internet at NTHS was appealing because the\nschool's high-speed Internet connection allowed\nstudents to gather more software in a shorter amount of time than\nthey would be able to gather at home on slower\nInternet connections. If students installed the software on NTHS\nmachines the school is liable for software license\nviolation. Students can also copy the software to Zip disks or\nCD-ROMs at school to take home and install on other\ncomputers or distribute freely to others. The school made no attempt\nto track the extent of software theft but did try\nto minimize unauthorized installation of software on school machines\nthrough education, the executable application\ndetection program described earlier, and walk-around monitoring by teachers.\nMinor nuisance-causing network activities were the equivalent of\nmischievous student pranks. Students could\nchange the network log-on screen information in subtle ways (for\nexample instead of the required domain name\nNAPA_NTHS, a prankster typed NTHS_NAPA or some other variation). When\nthe next student attempted to log on\nto the network he or she got an error message and usually could not\nfigure out what the problem was, requiring\nteacher assistance which in turn delayed instruction for the entire\nclass. Pranksters also typed vulgar words into logon\nwindows for the next student to read before logging on, the\nequivalent of on-screen graffiti.\nPranksters wrote and installed tiny computer programs that created a\nnuisance but did not damage anything.\nRather these programs waste instructional time as students and staff\nwork to figure out the problem. For example,\none student-created program automatically logged students off the\nnetwork as soon as they logged on, in effect\nshutting them out of the network until the program was disabled.\nStudents wrote programs in Lotus Notes which\nwere executed by clicking on an on-screen button. They sent the\nbuttons in email to other students with the simple\nmessage \"click me.\" When recipients clicked the button, hundreds of\nemail messages were automatically sent out,\nsometimes with offensive messages that appeared to be sent by the\nhapless button-clickers. The dilemma for the\nbutton-clickers then became whether to take the blame for the email\nspam they inadvertently sent out or to turn in\nthe senders of the \"click me\" buttons.\nOther abuses of the NTHS network were more sinister. Occasionally the\nschool was \"nuked,\" causing the\ncomputers to get \"bluescreened.\" This meant that someone ran a\nprogram called Win Nuke on the school computers,\ncausing the machines to lose their network connectivity, lose any\nunsaved data, and require restarting. Win Nuke did\nnot cause permanent damage, but it did delay instruction, cause\nstudents and staff to lose data, and serve as a\nreminder of the school's vulnerability to technological terrorism.\nA more malicious program called Back Orifice (a name parodying the\nMicrosoft Back Office software)\nplagued the school in Fall 1998. Back Orifice was surreptitiously\ninstalled on several NTHS machines, enabling\nremote control of the infected computers. The implications of Back\nOrifice installation were quite grave. For\nexample, the program allowed the installer to remotely control the\ncomputer desktop, restart the computer, display\npop-up messages to the user, read files including temporary files\ncontaining password information, record\nkeystrokes, send email from the user's account, and capture screen\nshots of the user's monitor. If a video camera\nwas installed on the user's computer, Back Orifice allowed the remote\ninstaller to control the camera and take video\nshots of the user surreptitiously. The ability of Back Orifice\ninstallers to access and maliciously use confidential\ninformation in a school setting was very serious cause for concern.\nThe students I interviewed revealed that the entire school network\nhad been open to hackers. Everything \u2013\nincluding the school web server, student and staff servers,\nindividual student and staff network accounts, email\naccounts, and individual hard drives \u2013 was accessible to motivated\nhackers from both on- and off-campus. The\nimplications of this unauthorized access on the privacy of students\nand staff were profound. Because the network\nmanager had saved a text document in her files containing all NTHS\npasswords, finding the school passwords was\nas easy as opening a text document. Student records, staff\ndiscussions on the database, staff email regarding student\ngrades and behavior, and student grade databases were accessible.\nReading these files, editing them, and sending\nemail in another person's name was possible. This had been the case\nfrom Fall 1996 \u2013 Fall 1998, until the school\nmoved its Internet connection from a commercial service provider to\nthe NVUSD wide area network. The students I\ninterviewed maintained that despite the move to the NVUSD network\nthey could still, with a great deal of work,\ngain access to the entire NTHS network because of security holes.\nI questioned my interviewees about how to solve the problem of\nnetwork security in poorly-funded public\ninstitutions, and they could not come up with any suggestions. They\nbelieved that there would always be security\nholes in computer systems that leave information vulnerable to\nattack. However, they maintained that overall NTHS\nhackers were non-malicious, and offered the fact that nothing serious\nhad happened to the school networks as\nevidence of their peer groups' beneficent nature.\nConsequences\nWhen misuse and abuse of the network occurred, offenders who were\ncaught were punished by having their\nnetwork privileges removed for a period of time, in essence an\nin-house suspension from the system. Students who\nare \"off the system\" receive their assignments via printout and turn\ntheir work in by writing by hand or using\ncomputers at the city\/county library, Napa Valley College, or at\nhome. In some classes, such as in the multimedia\nclass which required the use of expensive computer animation software\ngenerally not available anywhere else,\nproject deadlines are extended until the student is back on the\nsystem. After the initial expulsion from NTHS (the\nemail death threat situation discussed earlier), the political\ndifficulty of sending NTHS students back to the other\nNapa high schools prevented even those students who repeatedly abused\nthe network from being sent back to their\nprevious high schools. On only three occasions did the school\ndirector successfully convinced repeat network\nabusers and their parents that returning to the previous school\noffered the best solution for timely and trouble-free\ncompletion of high school requirements. In these cases, the return to\nthe previous school was entirely voluntary, thus\navoiding giving the other school principals grounds for complaints\nabout \"dumping\" of problem students.\nOver the course the study, I noted that it was typically a small\nportion of the less computer-proficient students\nwho made mistakes when misusing the computer system and are\nconsequently caught and punished. The school's\nAppropriate Use Policy and attendant disciplinary system functioned\nas a strong deterrent against malicious\nbehavior on the part of less computer-proficient students,\nsocializing them to accept limitations on the uses of\ncomputer technology in public settings. Highly\ntechnologically-skilled students, on the other hand, remained\nunconvinced of the school's ability or desire to follow through with\ntechnology-related discipline. The hacker\nstudents I interviewed found the school's disciplinary policy on\nsystem abuse laughable, saying it served no\ndeterrent function whatsoever. Because word of the Unix box incident\nquickly spread among them, in which school\nadministration chose to ignore the conduct, hackers learned that the\nschool staff would not or could not work\nseriously to enforce appropriate network use. These students felt\nquite secure in their ability to hack into the school\nsystem without being traced or punished. Because these hacker\nstudents possessed technology skills far superior to\nstaff skills, in reality the hackers truly were beyond policing by\nstaff. The striking resemblance between NTHS\ncomputer crime and computer crime in the larger society indicates\nthat NTHS hackers were using their time and\naccess to high-speed technology at school to further develop their\nhacking skills. For these students the covert\ncurriculum was one in which their sense of superiority over the\nadult, non-technological world was reinforced.\nThe problem of network security holes is not specific to NTHS or any\nother school. Rather, security breaches\nare a hazard faced by all public and private institutions that use\nInternet-connected computer technology. Ensuring\nnetwork security requires the expensive time and expertise of\nhighly-skilled computer professionals, a luxury which\nschools and other public institutions can rarely afford. In the case\nof public institutions, which are supposed to\ninspire trust in the citizenry and represent stability in the face of\nsocietal changes, the vulnerability of confidential\nand sensitive information becomes a public safety issue. In a K-12\nsetting the particular vulnerability of minors\nescalated the need to protect their confidential information from\nunauthorized access.\nThe contributions of this analysis are significant to the degree that\ncomputer technology is blended into\nAmerican high school classrooms. Tremendous staff and student time is\nchanneled from academic curriculum and\ninstruction because of student misuse and abuse of the computers and\ncomputer network, requiring more, not less,\npersonnel time. This finding refutes the myth that computers are\nlabor saving devices that will replace teachers and\nother school staff. The computer technology policies and procedures\nat NTHS, in the context of the overall strategy\nof constructivist pedagogy, contributed a great deal to the covert\ncurriculum and the development of the educational\nculture of the school. The strategies employed by staff members to\nenfranchise hacker students can be seen as\npartially successful in that some students apparently hacked the\nnetwork, but did so largely without malicious intent\nand without serious harm. Some hacker students were successfully\nrecruited as white hat hackers who helped to\ntroubleshoot and secure the integrity of the network.\nConclusion\nSocietal unease about computer network security has the potential to\nthreaten cyber-liberties currently\nenjoyed by Internet users around the globe. Corporations and\ngovernments may see no alternative to restrictive laws\nunless Internet users, cyber-liberties activists, and hacktivists\nwork together to create a culture in which responsible\nhacking is rewarded and destructive hacking is discouraged. Groups\nconcerned about developing an overall\ncomputing culture which maintains a balance between cyber-liberties\nand cyber-responsibility should work with\neducators to develop and implement ethics-based computing curriculum\nfor K-12 schools. Further study of\npedagogical models that foster student self-responsibility and\nethical computing habits is necessary to develop a\nrange of best-practices models from which educators can work.\nBibliography\nBajaj, V.

In four verticals dedicated to consumers, businesses, teachers and volunteers, the portal lays out a variety of information and spotlights events tied to the month of awareness. Particular attention is given to identity protection and mobile data security tips.\n\nThe portal allows users to post events as part of NCSAM and encourages individual involvement, beginning with a September 20 Twitter chat called STOP.THINK.CONNECT. Visitors can tune in to share ideas and learn easy ways to get involved during the month of October.\n\nAdditionally, several major events have been scheduled to coincide with the annual initiative. At the Online Trust Forum 2012 in San Jose, California, which takes place October 1-3, a series of speakers, panel discussions and workshops will discuss emerging issues and offer advice. Following the event, the Online Trust Alliance will offer three full-day security workshops.\n\nOther prominent events include the SOeC Cybersecurity Symposium and Awards conference in San Diego on October 11 and 12, as well as the Cyber Maryland Conference, taking place October 16-17 in Baltimore. The latter event also includes the Maryland Cyber Challenge and Competition, a cybersecurity battle between competing students and professionals.\n\nAs the focus of security shifts to more mobile and cloud computing, consumers and business professionals will have to adapt to new threats with novel tactics. This year's NCSAM approaches data protection with a collaborative mindset, organizing its efforts around the theme of \"Our Shared Responsibility.\"\n\nThe NCSA is a public-private non-profit partnership that works to promote digital safety. The organization's efforts are just one part of increased public sector engagement with cyber security. The Obama administration is currently in the process of drafting an executive order on cyber security, with a particular focus on protecting critical infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Homeland Security recently announced plans to launch its own website geared toward cyber security education and career training. That website, expected to arrive in December, will provide information on security scholarships and training, as well as offering industry news."}

{"text":"How Hackers Attack\n\nDespite the many products and services on the market designed to protect computers from getting hacked, many businesses\u2014small firms in particular\u2014are still suffering at the hands of cyberthieves.\n\nJust ask Lloyd Keilson, the co-founder of Lifestyle Forms & Displays Inc., a mannequin maker and importer that had $1.2 million wiped out of its bank account in just hours through online transactions in May. His story was described in a Wall Street Journal article Thursday.\n\nRelated Article\n\nMr. Keilson isn't entirely sure, though experts in Web security say that cyberthieves likely covertly installed a virus on one of his company's computers.\n\nThe firm's computers run on the Windows 7 operating system and the company uses an internal firewall to connect to the Internet, Mr. Keilson says.\n\nIts computers are Dell Inc. machines that his staff installed with antivirus software called Neatsuite purchased from Trend Micro Inc., a Japan-based security company, he adds.\n\nMichael Sweeny, a spokesman for Trend Micro, says Neatsuite is an older product.\n\nExperts say that it's possible that after one of Mr. Keilson's staffers tried to log onto the website for the company's bank, a virus may have redirected him or her to a fake page that looked identical to the bank's site.\n\nIf the employee typed in a username and temporary password provided by a secure-ID token, the virus might have sent that information to a thief who could have quickly logged into the bank's real website to make money transfers before the temporary password changed.\n\nPasswords created by tokens tend to be valid for about two minutes, say Web security experts. It's important to note that Mr. Keilson isn't able to confirm that this is what happened.\n\nWhy did the company's bank allow money to be transferred out of its account?\n\nIn this kind of scenario, banks commonly aren't aware anything is wrong because they're seeing someone log onto their websites with the correct information. Cyberthieves often transfer stolen funds to account created with stolen identification to avoid detection.\n\nHow do viruses get onto computers that have anti-virus software?\n\nComputer users often download viruses onto the machines inadvertently by clicking on a website, advertisement or email attachment embedded with malicious content. Mr. Keilson says he isn't aware that any of his employees did this.\n\nThough anti-virus software is designed to recognize such material, it doesn't always work because hackers are regularly refining their tricks.\n\n\"You have to continually evolve your technology approach to security to stay up with the latest threats,\" says Lawrence Pingree, an analyst at technology research firm Gartner Inc. \"What worked yesterday might not work today.\"\n\nDoes it matter what Web browser or operating system you use?\n\nSome Web browsers and operating systems have a reputation for doing a better job of preventing viruses from infecting computers than others.\n\n\"We see far more infections on Windows than we do Macs, Unix and Linux,\" says Wade Baker, author of the Verizon 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report, a study based on cybercrime investigations conducted by Verizon's team, which is comprised of data-breach reports from Verizon and various law-enforcement groups around the globe, including the U.S. Secret Service and the Australian Federal Police.\n\nMr. Baker says there's long been a debate over which Web browsers are the safest but that all browsers \u2013 including popular ones like Safari and Firefox -- are susceptible to viruses when users recklessly click on Web ads, email attachments and other online content.\n\nSo what can I do to keep hackers at bay?\n\nBe cautious when downloading any material from the Web and opening email attachments. If you don't trust the source, don't open it.\n\nAlso, contact your bank and find out what Web-related protections it offers businesses and what it's liable for in the event of a cyberattack on your firm's account.

{"text":"For almost two decades, military analysts have worried that foreign powers might use computer networks to inflict harm on the United States.

At moments of particular tension between hostile states, computer network attacks have been launched against national infrastructure, causing large-scale disruptions. It happened in Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and South Korea in 2011. Meanwhile, large and important American companies, including Google, Lockheed Martin, and RSA, have fallen victim to highly sophisticated, multi-stage attacks.

So-called \"advanced persistent threats\"\u2014from highly skilled attackers with deep knowledge of the target\u2014are a major headache for American companies.\n\nSo far, the United States government has responded with earnest but vague calls to strengthen international norms of good behavior in the cyber realm.

{"text":"Hacking the mind: why your brain might be the next target\n\nAs neural controllers grow in popularity, so will hackers attempts to create malicious code to potentially corrupt, control and infiltrate our brains. So, what are the experts doing about it?\n\nIt's a quiet, sunny day in 2015: you've just strapped your neural mind transmitter to your head and connected to an e-ink display, ready to connect with your personal cloud computer.\n\nYou control the screen with instructions from the brain, without the need for hands or additional peripherals - this is the essence of a neural-powered computer.\n\nBut suddenly you freeze, unable to focus on the data. The brain is 'stuck'. Everything feels locked and you're helpless to resist the infiltration into your brain. Within seconds, your body is now placed under the control of a neural hacker.\n\nThis is the emerging hacking threat that some scientists and security experts are already beginning to ponder - even before the technology takes off in the mainstream.\n\nThe concern extends from the notion that if we create devices with the ability to control our electronic world, devices without the need for limbs or movements, might we be leaving ourselves susceptible to hackers, eager to cipher our brainwaves for outright control?\n\nAccording to a Wired report, we might closer to the reality of these 'neural hacker' attacks than we realise.\n\nWorse still, may be the creation of neural malware by hackers. Our brains have the potential to become digital breeding grounds for brain-targeting trojans; computer viruses with the ability to stay dormant in much the same way that the biological variant would work, but with more chilling security implications, when the exploits are finally switched on.\n\nIn a scene reminiscent of the mind operated, plug-in game controllers shown in David Cronenberg's eXistenZ, 'brain attacks' may emerge in the years to come; the next big unsecured area of computing. There's already a number of children's toys on the market that harness our brain waves, giving 21st century kids the first chance to become used to such technology.\n\nA scene from eXistenZ, where users connect to an organic game pod\n\nHowever, if we start to use our brains as giant hard drives, how secure will our thoughts really be?\n\nThe neural hacking concept is due to become a reality, if the rapid growth of neural machines and neural learning devices in the market is anything to go by. Emotiv is one company at the forefront of this growing industry, particularly in games.\n\nThere are now neural computing devices designed for games, simulators and more importantly, for the disabled. Neural networks seem to have unlimited applications - but at what cost to the wearer? There may come a time when security firms offer regular anti-virus products alongside specialised neural network versions, as a second precaution to peoples concerns.\n\nChief among these concerns is how these neural machines will run off wireless signals and the degree of simplicity to which hackers will be able to infiltrate mind controlled devices using automatic bots and scripts designed to search for these machines over the networks.\n\nAdditionally, the military has reportedly invested in neural technologies.

{"text":"Post navigation\n\nOutsiders! Insiders! Let's call the whole thing off.\n\nI have no idea whether outsiders or insiders are responsible for more losses, and while the topic is somewhat interesting, it seems to me to be something of a marketing-generated distraction.\nI've worked in environments where I am absolutely certain that insiders were the predominant threat, in environments where they probably were, and in environments where they probably were not. In no case would I have been able to conclude this from criminal prosecution data, which is what one report relies on to support it's conclusions.\nMy point is that regardless of what the aggregate \"threat landscape\" looks like, there is no substitute for knowing your own environment, and for proper threat modeling and countermeasures.\n[The image is part of a screenshot from infosecdaily.net, circa February 22, 2005]\n\nNot only are insiders more likely to be identified, but they're also more likely to be prosecuted. I agree: let's call the whole thing off. A successful attack will often look *just* like an insider one, at least at the beginning. And whether you're more vulnerable to external attacks depends a lot on how well you're managing the standard system vulnerabilities. Insider attacks tend to be more creative and varied, in my experience.\n\nHave you read the Insider by Dan Verton? He cites the figure of $250 BILLION a year (2004 figures) by the US attorney general as the cost of insider attacks in the US alone. With that much loss you would think that prosecutions would be in the news every day.\nMaybe the perpetrators of MAJOR insider attacks are prosecuted, by I would guess that the dearth of internal controls inside the network means that the enterprise has very little real knowledge of actual losses as they are probably hidden losses.\n\nRather than attempt to quantify the \"threat\" I like to think\/talk\/write about the \"risk\". Given that there are both inside and outside threats, it is harder to defend the inside than the perimeter so therefore the risk is usually higher on the inside. The primary reason for this is that defending against insiders involves changes to business procesess and those are hard to accomplish.\n\nThinking about the second half of the screen shot above, it is interesting to think about the converse of the statement.\nIT designed to keep confidential data inside the network, using deny-by-default, user-centric information-focused security, would actually prevent intrusion from the outside.\n\nIn fiance, insiders are by far and away the biggest threat to finance; to a much lesser extent in other industries. The amount of money stolen by outsiders is trivial, that by insiders is massive. Prosecutions are rare, and there are some areas where prosecutors seem to bend over backwards to avoid prosections.\nOne fraud I monitored peripherally I estimated at around $700bn over its lifetime, I might be out by an order of magnitude, but not two. Fines stalled somewhere before $2bn, and within a year of the prosecutions starting up, the word on the street said that \"business was back to normal\"; leading perps who were caught every way you can possibly imagine paid fines, and walked. Generally, in profit. Only secondary parties went to jail, IIRC, being those who facilitated, not instigated."}
{"text":"US produces cyber plan, says threat rising\n\nWarning that US companies are the target of intensive cyber espionage campaigns, President Barack Obama's top security officials say they are struggling to defend the nation from attacks on its most crucial private computer networks and called on Congress to pass legislation that would close regulatory gaps.\n\nThe executive order, which Obama signed on Tuesday, relies heavily on participation from US industry in creating new voluntary standards for protecting information. The order also expands the government's effort to share threat data with companies.\n\nBut politicians and cyber experts say that Obama's directive is missing what US businesses need most: legal protection so they don't get sued if they acknowledge they've been hacked or share that data with competitors. That can only come from Congress, which hasn't been able to agree on how to protect businesses and consumers alike.\n\n\"The government is often unaware of malicious activity targeting our critical infrastructure,\" said General Keith Alexander, head of the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command.\n\n\"These blind spots prevent us from being in a position of helping critical infrastructure defend itself and it prevents us from knowing when we need to defend the nation,\" Alexander told industry and government officials at the Commerce Department.\n\nIn Obama's speech on Tuesday, heHe added, \"Now, Congress must act as well by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.\"\n\nObama's executive order has been months in the making and is the product of often-difficult negotiations with private sector companies that oppose any increased government regulation.\n\nWhile largely symbolic, the plan leaves several practical questions unanswered: Should a business be required to tell the government if it has been hacked and US interests are at stake? Can a person sue her bank or water treatment facility if those companies don't take reasonable steps to protect her? If a private company's systems are breached, should the government swoop in to stop the attacks - and pick up the tab?\n\nUnder the president's new order, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has a year to finalise a package of voluntary standards and procedures that will help companies address their cybersecurity risks. The package must include flexible, performance-based and cost-effective steps that critical infrastructure companies can take to identify the risks to their networks and systems and ways they can manage those risks.\n\nThere also must be incentives the government can use to encourage companies to meet the standards, and the Pentagon will have four months to recommend whether cybersecurity standards should be considered when the department makes contracting decisions.\n\nThe order also calls for agencies to review their existing regulations to determine whether the rules adequately address cybersecurity risks"}

One way that has been reported recently, has been this: a hacker designs for good virus, loads it on a pen drive, and silk screens the company logo on the face of the drive. He then leaves it somewhere conspicuous, on the company's premises, as in the parking lot or an ATM. The hacker hopes that a company employee will discover it, plug it into his company laptop to find out who it belongs to, and by doing this, will activate a virus inside that will steal all the company passwords stored on the laptop. It will then phone home, with its cache of stolen passwords. Most firewalls and other defenses do not count on having a company employee personally bring something in like this.\n\nThe Google attacks in China were a twist on the traditional phishing tactic. They were called spear-phishing attacks. They send counterfeit e-mails to people, taking the trouble to design the e-mails with official-looking emblems and stationery, but they aim for a specific person in the organization, and they mention a well-known friend in the from-address section too. It is all about getting past an employee, and having him invite the virus inside by his own actions. They don't just need anti virus software anymore. They need anti-gullibility behavioral training for their employees.\n\nCell phones are not such targets for now with hackers so far, because there are so many models and so many different operating systems. But with a very popular model like the iPhone, things could start happening, that would turn the smart phone into a surveillance device that records pictures and audio. They can even tap into an iPhone, to learn exactly where the owner is, with GPS.\n\nIn a high-tech world, low-tech is often the way infiltrations take place these days.Often, we are just looking at hoof prints and thinking exotic zebras, when we should be thinking donkeys. We need to think low-tech once again today.\n\nEveryone's experienced it: you visit a webpage and a flashing banner on top that looks like a Windows dialog box informs you (falsely) that a virus has been discovered on your system and it invites you to click on it to help you disinfect. When you press on it though you are taken to a website that will in all probability download a computer virus to infect your heretofore clean system. They have a name for it now: it is called Scareware \u2013 probably because it achieves its ends through scaring people into playing into the hands of the exploiters. What the manipulators have in mind, could be anything from trying to sell you useless software, right down to obtaining your cooperation for installing malware on your computer. Published statistics say that this is quite a popular way these days in which to attack computers or make an easy buck; there has been a fourfold increase in programs of this kind that float about on the Internet in the past year alone \u2013 there are about 10,000 of these now abroad. They also use the term Scareware for legitimate security programs like antivirus software too that try to put up a show of doing a good job by constantly alerting the user to every little unremarkable thing in an alarmist way. A similar-sounding but unrelated term is Ransomware \u2013 a virus that holds your system to ransom threatening to erase everything unless you pay up.\n\nMany webmasters are engaged with WordPress to establish their business by taking advantage of using the blogging software. Although there are number of benefits to be realized by using WordPress, some entrepreneurs are facing serious issues like security vulnerability. In order to make sure its users have the most secure platform available WordPress has released a new version 2.8.2 security patch.\n\nThis new version will help webmasters to get rid of an XSS vulnerability that was identified by a site admin. The XSS vulnerability will allow hackers to access the admin page by inserting certain code in a form. The previous version of WordPress 2.8.1 was released just two weeks ago.\n\nAnyone running WordPress 2.8 or 2.8.1 can upgradeto this latest version right away. The latest major version is faster than ever. Don't delay! WordPress 2.8.2 is available for download here. Development on 2.9 is already underway, with a bunch of feature list. Hope the WordPress team will release it soon.\n\nMozilla released Firefox 3.5 on 30th June 2009, and claimed that it contains more improved features than the previous version, supporting new web technologies, improving performance and ease of use. On July 9, Firefox user \"zbyte\" submitted an error report to Mozilla's bug tracking system. According to the report, the browser crashes when text is typed into an input box in the site apport.ru instead of fetching the search result.\n\nIt is found that the security flaw lies in the Firefox's Just-In-Time (JIT) Javascript compiler. Due to the vulnerability, the JIT compiler could become corrupt when a user lands on a tainted web page and paves way for an attacker to insert a malicious code on the user's computer.\n\nInitially, Firefox advised its users to turn off Javascript or use Noscript add-on. Another simple solution was to set \"javascript.options.jit.content\" to false in the configuration page which can be opened by typing about:config in the address bar.\n\nFinally, Mozilla has come up with a permanent solution by releasing a new version of Firefox 3.5.1 which fixes the critical security vulnerability. Just upgrade your browser to the newer version to safeguard it from Javascript vulnerability. Don't forget to enable your Javascript after updating your browser to the 3.5.1 version. Another issue that was making Firefox take a long time to load some Windows systems was fixed in the new version.\n\nFacebook, the most successful social network today, allows its adherents to create very different groups. However Facebook has to protect its system and that's why some rules have to be respected.\n\nIt seems to be evident that a group like \"Rogue Facebook Apps Early Warning Group\" appears as a dangerous threat, even more when one knows that they spread unsafe information. But nevertheless, appearances could be misleading. Actually this group was created to warn its members about attacks happening on the social network and the risky information was divulged by mistake. But the Facebook team disabled the account of the group's administrator. This decision appears like an unfair punishment.\n\nThe red line between knowing to attack and to protect isn't often easy to determine. In fact the real stake of \"protecting Facebook\" is not really to care for the application, but to protect the personal information and data of its numerous members who trust it and its security. We know that Facebook is not just a network of private life but also a job network. Therefore the dangers and stakes are greater.\n\nSo is it really a shame to form a group which can help adherents to be sure of their privacy and confidentiality? Having to opt between the network system's survival and our own information, the choice should be quick!\n\nScansafe, the largest global provider of Web Security-as-a-Service, reported that a stealthy malware called Gumblar targets users of Internet Explorer and forcibly redirects Google search page results to compromised pages. It also steals FTP details of victims and creates a backdoor on the system. It is named for the domain gumblar.cn involved in the attacks.\n\n\"The stolen FTP credentials are then used to further compromise any Websites owned or operated by the victim,\" Mary Landesman, senior security researcher at ScanSafe, told eWEEK. \"As a result, there is exponential growth of these compromises\u2014as more victims are infected by encountering a compromised site, the number of compromised sites also increases and thus more visitors are exposed.\"\n\nLandesman told SCMagazineUS.com, \"Gumblar attacks have jumped nearly 188 percent over the first week of May.\" The report also says that more than 1,500 Websites including Tennis.com, Variety.com and Coldwellbanker.com have been attacked in the first week of May.\n\nThe goal of the malware is to siphon dollars from Google's highly profitable advertising franchises, by replacing links in the Google's search results page with those of the attacker's choice.\n\nThe attacker has made exploit code unique for every website, so it has become hard to identify a compromised site until it is surfed. Actually, the malware embeds malicious Javascript deep into a website's source code that exploits the bug in a visitor's Adobe Flash and Reader programs and makes the victim join a botnet that manipulates their Google search results. So users are advised to make sure their patches from Adobe Systems are up-to-date.\n\nA Google spokesman told SCMagazineUS.com that some compromised sites associated with this exploit may include a warning, saying \"this site may harm your computer\" associated with their search results listing.\n\nUK's Get Safe Online campaign conducted a study on cybercrime and revealed the following result: to an internet fraudster, an identity is worth \u00a380 and in 2008 the victim rate is raised to 23% compared to 15% in 2007.\n\nIt has become a must for every online user to be aware of cyber crimes and the safety measures to be adopted get rid of them. Here we have listed some of the common threats that are faced by most online users with solutions to avoid them.\n\nThe main focus of an internet fraudster is to find out personal details of online users, and use those details to gain access to bank accounts, run up bills, create false documents such as passports or birth certificates and carry out benefit fraud.\n\nGenerally, hackers send email messages in the name of a legitimate organization such as a bank, demanding the user to update their personal details for security. Remember, that a bank will not ask you to reveal your personal details on email. So don't pay heed to such emails.\n\nMany hi-tech criminals attract people by sending emails on current affairs or other attractive subjects with an attachment. The attachment could be a booby trap with a malicious program through which they can collect users' personal details. Install an anti-virus program in your system and update it daily before opening your mail box to get rid of such viruses.\n\nSometimes, when you open a website, a popup window will appear and say that 'you have just won a million dollars' or 'your computer is affected by a virus'. The message will ask you to click on the window which you should never do. If you click on the message, you will be taken to a website and asked to download a software likely spyware. Simply don't respond to such popup windows. It is better to enable a plug-in to block unwanted popup windows.\n\nInstall a trusted anti-spyware program to safeguard your computer from spyware. As Microsoft's Windows lacks security, security firms advice online users using Microsoft software to update it as soon as security fixes are available. Online users are advised to use non-Microsoft programs for web browsing."}
{"text":"While targets are spread around the world, the focus appears to be embassies, government agencies, military and energy organisations in Eastern Europe, former USSR countries, and Central Asia. No attacks were made on UK authorities, however Kaspersky admitted its research was limited to its own network of users, so there are likely more victims than its report shows.\n\nSuch information could be traded in the underground and sold to the highest bidder, which can be of course, anywhere\n\nThe attacks are still on-going, and started at least as far back as 2007, allowing for hundreds of terabytes of data to be collected.\n\nIt was unclear who the attackers are, but Kaspersky said they appeared to be of Russian-speaking origin, based on pieces of evidence found in the code. \"Notably, one of the commands in the Trojan dropper switches the codepage of an infected machine to 1251 before installation,\" the company said. \"This is required to address files and directories that contain Cyrillic characters in their names.\"\n\nHowever, that could have been planted in the code to make it look like Russians were behind the attacks, Kaspersky claims.\n\nThe security firm said there was no evidence that the attacks were state-sponsored. \"The information stolen by the attackers is obviously of the highest level and includes geopolitical data which can be used by nation states,\" the report said. \"Such information could be traded in the underground and sold to the highest bidder, which can be of course, anywhere.\"\n\nThe attacks are highly targeted, and \"carefully tuned to the specifics of the victims,\" Kaspersky said, marking a change from the \"highly automated\" Flame campaign.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe Trojan's malicious code was delivered via an email attachment, making use of known flaws in Excel, Word and PDFs.\n\nThe code sets up communication with the command and control servers, and receives additional \"spy modules\", which it uses to infect connected smartphones and steal data.\n\n\"After initial infection, the malware won't propagate by itself - typically, the attackers would gather information about the network for a few days, identify key systems and then deploy modules which can compromise other computers in the network, for instance by using the MS08-067 exploit,\" the report said.\n\nSome of the data harvesting is on-going - such as grabbing data from a phone every time it's connected, or recording all keystrokes - while others are one-off tasks, such as extracting passwords, browser history and account information.\n\nWhen it finds the information it's looking for, the system packs up the data and encrypts it before transferring it back to the C&C servers. Kaspersky found more than 60 domains for the C&C servers, with many named to look like Windows or Microsoft update systems.\n\nThe Red October attack also builds a backup into the computer, allowing the attackers to regain access if C&C servers are shut down."}
{"text":"Schneier on Security\n\nFebruary 21, 2013\n\nMore on Chinese Cyberattacks\n\nWow, isthisacrazymediafrenzy. We should know better. These attacks happen all the time, and just because the media is reporting about them with greater frequency doesn't mean that they're happening with greater frequency.\n\nHype aside, the Mandiant report on the hackers is very good, especially the part where the Chinese hackers outted themselves through poor opsec: they logged into Facebook from their work computers.\n\nBut this is not cyberwar. This is not war of any kind. This is espionage, and the difference is important. Calling it war just feeds our fears and fuels the cyberwararmsrace.\n\nIn a private e-mail, Gary McGraw made an important point about attribution that matters a lot in this debate.\n\nBecause espionage unfolds over months or years in realtime, we can triangulate the origin of an exfiltration attack with some certainty. During the fog of a real cyber war attack, which is more likely to happen in milliseconds, the kind of forensic work that Mandiant did would not be possible. (In fact, we might just well be \"Gandalfed\" and pin the attack on the wrong enemy.)\n\nSadly, policymakers seem to think we have completely solved the attribution problem. We have not. This article published in Computerworld does an adequate job of stating my position.\n\nThose of us who work on security engineering and software security can help educate policymakers and others so that we don't end up pursuing the folly of active defense.\n\nI agree.\n\n. I don't see any good coming of this.\n\nFunny that RobertT was mentioning Datong (it's in the report) recently on this blog[1]. I'm reading the report now. It's been interesting so far. I like how they're attributing the attacks to Unit 61398. That kind of methodical attribution is much better than \"the Chinese are coming! the Chinese are coming! there was an IP!\"\n\nThe overall aim here wasn't to 'take down' an enemy. It was about economic gain through corporate espionage. It's also questionable whether there's even an enemy here, assuming the Chinese government were behind this - the business partnerships and displomatic relationships are still quite healthy between the US and China.\n\n@TMG64 No Bruce is right. This is espionage not war. Now it can be argued that it is espionage in prelude to a war, but no destructive acts have been committed yet. The media and politicians are too apt to use the word war when describing things that are more properly defined as struggles. I.e the drug war or a war on obesity or illiteracy or whatever. Those are struggles not wars.\n\n\"Gandalfed:\" cool word to indicate that you attack the wrong enemy, or attribute the attack to the wrong group.\nI agree with the post that we have not solved the attribution problem. I continue to argue that during the long millisecond where the attack is active, there is no need to attribute. There is simply a need to make the attack stop. Find out where the attack originates after you halt the attack with an appropriate use of force. That use of force does not necessarily mean hacking back or other arguably illegal acts, it could mean sending cease and desist letters, or filing suit.\n\nTake a look at orlandodoctrine.com, at our use of force continuum. We've been discussing this for a while, and we would appreciate your thoughts.\n\nSchneier, much like the McAfee reports on Aurora, the actual evidence upon which they base their conclusions is not directly available to us, and thus we can't criticize or reproduce their actual results, or identify the veracity of the evidence (due for example to poor or second-hand collection technique.)\n\nCorroboration, triangulation, and actual evidence including binaries that we can strip apart ourselves is the only way to know the truth. Right now, the report is a presentation of results balanced on hidden evidence.\n\nThe fact that the public is swallowing this so completely IMO directly follows from the quality of the typesetting as much as the contents themselves.\n\nThe Mandiant report was excellent. This is the kind of work I like reading on. I'll ignore the stuff most people talk about in reports like this, as someone will talk about them. ;) Here are a few things that jumped out at me.\n\n\"This is not a PDF file. It looks like the filename has a PDF extension but the filename actually includes 119 spaces after .pdf followed by .exe - the real extension. APT1 even went to the trouble of turning the executable's icon to an adobe symbol to complete the ruse.\"\n\nVery nice work by the attackers. Of course, one suggested defense is sandboxing or blocking file execution. Smart as they were, that basic defense would have stopped that attack. An advanced version might ask for permission for the \"executable\" to do certain things, with user going \"wth, this isn't an executable?!\"\n\nAPT1 Hacker Profile uglygorilla\n\nZhang Zhaozhong's works \"Network Warfare\" and \"Winning the Information War\" might make interesting reading for both hackers and strategists trying to understand the opponents.\n\nConclusion (p60)\n\nThey conclude with sharp wit. They give China a way out, then smash it with Occam's Razor.\n\n@ Bruce Schneier Re Computerworld Article\n\nI agree it should be considered espionage rather than war. These attackers infiltrated systems worldwide. They blended in. They impersonated people. They stole key information. They presumably use that information to compete in commercial and military matters. This is more Cold War than bloody war. It's spies vs people with assets not expecting spies. Bombs don't solve this problem.\n\nThat said, I think an active attack against the Unit is an interesting option. We know the attackers use Windows on their internal machines. We know many of their local IP's. They also use plenty of COTS hardware and software. We can get a hold of this by buying it in the open market or using clandestine forces to acquire it. From there, the government could use a third party not too reliant on China to try to infiltrate their networks. They can map them out, try to find evidence of stolen data on client machines, maybe try to physically tap lines going to building, etc. Their options will be monitoring, exfiltration of important data, disruption, digital sabotage, and physical sabotage. We must assume all data chinese have stolen is theirs to keep. Additionally, any active attacks will only delay the inevitable and might cause retaliation that leads to unacceptable damage to national assets.\n\n\".\"\n\nI'm sure the media frenzy was created for that purpose. How else can those actions be justified?\n\nThe media is running with a story that suits their needs. The military is exaggerating the war analogy. Cyber___ is sexier than computer___, we have to live with that. The attacks appear to have been documented as true. If our government can't agree on a budget to avoid the cliff then I wonder if it can manage the risk to our networks.\n\n@Mark - OK, what term would you like them to use? What is it about the word 'cyber' that bothers you? The word was used for many years in different contexts but no one seemed to mind. I don't understand how attaching the 'cyber' to anything makes it scarier than it actually is. How about 'electro' or 'inter' or ... maybe the media should use some kind of euphemism like 'bad thing'.\n\nI'm a bit mixed on it myself. The main reason people oppose it is because it's predominately used in ignorant ways by media or to promote a cyberwar agenda. That makes it a nice warning signal that BS is coming in a news piece.\n\nOn the other side, cyber has a long history before cyberwar. It's a word that sounds pretty cool. Cyberspace was one of hackers' nicknames for the Internet early on. You could say the word has some history. I think it's become like the word hacker: started meaning something awesome and neutral, but media slanted it into bad usage.\n\nHi,\nIam doing research in this field for some time at the university and we have written a paper about this which should end some endless discussion with some plausible logical arguments. The term war in this context misleads and in a lot of more cases the term cyberwar is not useful esp. if we have no attribution. The word war and the legal usage of it includes three logical requirements:\n\n(1) It is conceptually impossible to be in a state of war without there being someone with whom one is at war. (Binary Condition\/Two-place-Condition)\n\n(2) It is conceptually impossible to be in a state of war with oneself.\n(Non-Reflexivity-Condition)\n\n(3) It is conceptually necessary that two conflicting parties are epistemically\ndistinct in a stage of war. (Epistemic Distinction-Condition)\n\n[Iam writing at the moment a formalization of this requirements, so you could disproof most of these hypercyberfoopeople with some nice formalism :P ]\n\nSo if you accept this you cannot use the term in this context without attribution! If you want to sacrifice these concepts you will end in a bad situation.\nFrom our paper on this topic:\"And there are some protagonist in the debate hold the opinion that there is no and there will be no 'cyberwar' in the sense of international law for classificatory reasons. They argue that we should not talk about 'cyberwar' unless there is a phenomenon that deserves such a classification, for example, when a sovereign state declares war (only) in cyberspace ('fifth domain'). They suggest that all current phenomena should only be treated as special cases of different types of conflict and should be labelled accordingly. Although we partially agree on their point, we think that this is only the second best way to acknowledge what is really at stake here. The impossibility of non-attribution make things even worse, because it causes a conceptual and not merely a classificatory problem. By providing a different approach and new line of reasoning, we draw the conclusion that under the condition of non-attribution we\ncannot talk about 'cyberwar' given our conceptual practice and usage of 'war'.\"\nIf you want to read the paper A Non-Attribution-Dilemma and its Impact on Legal Regulation of Cyberwar\nMichael Niekamp and Florian Grunert\n\nOne overlooked aspect of the Mandiant report is that Mandiant had hacked into the hackers computers. Look at their video: Mandiant had detailed screen captures showing everything some of the hackers were doing. This is great work, and they were wise (and very brave) to include so much detail to make their points irrefutable. Until now, I had dismissed comments that the Chinese govt was involved as wild speculation.\n\nTaiwan isn't part of China. Taiwan has its own (democratically elected) government, passports, currency, exchange rates, military, languages, writing system, international calling code, and ccTLD. Taiwan broke away from China in 1949, 64 years ago, when the communists took over. Anything else is just political posturing.\n\nIt is cyber-espionage, but done at such a massive scale that it will have a strongly negative effect on the U.S. economy in the long-run. You could consider this a type of economic war that removes the competitive advantage from U.S. businesses and drives more production of products to Chinese businesses. So yes, the U.S. government should be doing whatever it can to limit the amount of theft of IP, business plans, contract negotiations, etc., that are occurring against U.S. businesses, particularly from China.\n\nBut this is not cyberwar. This is not war of any kind. This is espionage, and the difference is important. Calling it war just feeds our fears and fuels the cyberwar arms race.\n\nBut this is the way the Pentagon want things.\n\nIt's possibly slipped past many people but the Pentagon have a new medal comming out \"The Distinquished Warfare Medal\" for Cyber-warriors. And guess what they are placing it above the Purple Heart in order of merit.\n\nSo as far as the US top brass are concerned it appears the most senior of medals will nolonger be for conspicuous bravery and physical courage in the face of the enemy but for the collateral damage done against the enemy (and presumably their civillians)...\n\nWhilst the brass are currently talking about drone pilots, the wording means that all cyber-warriors are eligible which includes those involved with the likes of Stuxnet etc...\n\nThere's a story that's been going around since the 80's that when the US government discovered the Soviet government trying to steal computer control designs the US deliberately allowed the Soviets to steal some bad designs. Which resulted in a severe malfunction in gas line controls and an explosion.\n\nI wonder if the PRC is vetting the stuff it's stealing for disinformation?\n\nIt would appear PhD student and research assistant Wesley McGrew at Mississippi State University will be using the code recovered from attacks over the past few years to run a reverse engineering class.\n\nHe will be teaching\/training 14 engineering and computer science students the ins and outs of how to analyze the malicious software.\n\nWhich is actually no bad thing, for other good and proper reasons. As I've been known to comment in the past CS students rarely get taught the equivalent of \"testing techniques\" that most engineering students get taught. The value such training will add to their abilities will provide a life long benifit and put them well ahead of other CS graduates in the market place.\n\nHowever a health warning on the article it's self it does make a couple of factually incorect statments such as,\n\nNo two files have the same MD5 hash unless they are exactly the same, which makes it a good way to identify files.\n\nWhilst MD5 does make a good way to identify identical files, it is known that it is possible for two non identical files to have the same MD5 hash [1]\n\nThe article is also superficial in that whilst it goes into MD5 usage it does not sufficiently follow up on it.\n\nSo to fill in a bit ;-)\n\nIt is interesting to note about the use of the MD5 hashes showing up that the identical malware is being used repeatedly. That is these attacks in effect look like \"script kiddie\" attacks, but are they?\n\nIf the attack code was actually being produced by those carrying out the attacks then it would be relativly trivial for them to change the file in a myriad of different ways such that the MD5 hashes would not match but still have identical functionality. It is not as though polymorphing malware is an unknown concept [2].\n\nSo why have they not morphed the code?\n\nWhilst McGrew indirectly gives one possability for this,\n\nAttackers are less likely to use their more advanced malware against a target if a simpler one suffices, since it could be detected and blocked in the future.\n\nIt misses out on the fact that generaly morphing your code reduces your detectability whilst still using the functionaly equivalent maleware. Thus would get around many AV products repeatedly with what is minimal effort on behalf of tthe attackers.\n\nSo why are the attackers not doing it?\n\nIs it because the traditional AV products are so deficient that there is no reason to both? or is there another reason?\n\nWhilst it is known that much AV software fails to detect upto 30% of known malware there are various types of detector that work in different ways. Essentialy you can do the more traditional \"Black list\" approach or the less often seen \"white list\" aproach.\n\nThus there are other possability that needs to be considered over and above the basic detectability \"black list\" avoidance. White listing of executables takes the opposite aproach to black listing and various organisations like Bit9 offer such systems, which in effect are secondary code signing services.\n\nBit9 has recently admitted to the fact that it has been attacked [3] a while ago and this resulted in the copying of atleast one code signing key. Further that the copy of the key has also been used to illicitly sign code (which I assume was malicious in some way) which hass turned up on atleast three of it's customers systems.\n\nThis shows how easy it is to not understand the motives of an attacker based only on a limited view point of analysing what has been used to attack you. That is you don't know if thay are A, script kiddies, B, using the same malware because it surfices, or C, Use the same code to get past other defences you may not be aware of.\n\nSo how do you improve upon this information to get a better understanding of an attackers operational motives that give rise to the seen MO?\n\nWell it means resorting to the tools of espionage, be they old \"boots on the ground\" to more modern methods. The problem with either method is entrapment of those using the tools and thus reveiling \"Methods and Sources\".\n\nAs others have noted the company investigating went after the supposed attackers and infiltrated their systems. There are three problems with this, firstly it's not lawful, secondly it provides the attackers with propaganda for reprisals and further activities, thirdly it shows information about your methods.\n\nIt is the third option we need to be wary of because if the attackers systems are vulnerable it is more than likely that nearly everybodies systems are vulnerable.\n\nAnd this gives us a fourth possability which is ineffect a reverse \"Honey net\" where the enemy deliberatly uses systems that are \"standard\" and by using detectable attacks invite retaliation and thus get to see how the defenders go about it and what exploits etc they use...\n\nSo on balance I find defenders going into the attackers systems to be an unwise thing to do. Not only because it's illegal but more importantly that it is actually more likely to give more to the attackers than it will to the defenders...\n\n[1] This is because MD5 is in effect a compression function that is the equivalent of a one way function. Thus a little thought shows that if you have a file bigger than the MD5 hash size it will hash to the same value as a file smaller or equal to the hash size. That is MD5 like any hash produces a number out that is within a fixed range, thus if you have more data than that range going into the hash function then it will map down non uniquely to a number in that range.\n\n[2] Polmorhic code comes in various forms, some polymorhic virus code contains the morphing engine some don't. One type uses encryption to morph which although simple has a downside in that the decryption code remains the same in the head of the virus and this can be dettected by looking for the byte pattern at a given offset from the code start point.\n\n@Nick P\n\"On the other side, cyber has a long history before cyberwar. It's a word that sounds pretty cool. Cyberspace was one of hackers' nicknames for the Internet early on. You could say the word has some history. I think it's become like the word hacker: started meaning something awesome and neutral, but media slanted it into bad usage.\"\n\nOne the KEWL words start getting used by the uncool kidz and noobz, then they aren't kewl any more.\n\nAll you needed to say there, is that MD5 like any digest function, maps an infinite number of unique possible files\/messages onto one of a finite number of hash values. Collisions are obviously possible, just unlikely to happen by accident (and still rather difficult to cause on purpose).\n\n\"(1) It is conceptually impossible to be in a state of war without there being someone with whom one is at war. (Binary Condition\/Two-place-Condition)\"\n\nDepends if we define war as a conflict between two or more recognized parties. Here's a hypothetical situation. Let's say some insurgent group wants to get at assets with a major country. They've begun attacking the country, trying various tactics to get the assets. The country doesn't know their names, location, or even motive. It hasn't caught one yet. The country might then take defensive measures to protect assets it sees at risk. It might prepare to take strong action against any identified insurgents. However, it has no solid clue who the opponent is. We're already in a situation where one side is definitely at war with SOMEONE and the other side is at war for practical purposes, but has no identifiable opponent. Substitute these tactics for those that are deniable, maybe resembling faults, and now you have a war that's real but looks imaginary to outsiders. It stretches the definition quite a bit.\n\nIf it sounds too hypothetical, I should note there are parallels to this in cyberwar. We often fight little skirmishes with unknown opponents\/goals. Certain attacks might look like innocent activity. The evidence that the intrusion is taking place might be a computer crashing, a spike of network traffic or some other thing that can happen in a benign network. Their goal is usually access to confidential data, subversion of machines for their purposes, or sabotage. From the defenders point, though, they're are at war with cybercrooks in general but... who specifically? what progress is being made? Harder questions to answer...\n\n\"(2) It is conceptually impossible to be in a state of war with oneself.\n(Non-Reflexivity-Condition)\"\n\nThis one is easier to counter. It assumes there is a such thing as \"oneself\" in the sense it's one thing with one goal or set of beliefs. It's well known that people fight with themselves over many competiting motivations, wants, etc. Certain neuroscience shows the brain's pieces themselves compete with each other, our action emerging from it. Certain self-loathing people are at war with themselves. Strong pessimists are mentally at war with themselves, subverting every good thing they attempt. Throw in multiple personality disorder, certain schizophrenic conditions, etc. People with mental disorders, for instance, can act as if possessed or coinhabited with a malicious being that fights against their thoughts, perceptions and actions. These kinds of things supported primitive beliefs in \"demonic possession.\" Seeing this, it's hard to say war is an internal self vs external entity situation.\n\nNote that you can apply these same concepts to groups. There's isn't a US government, for instance. There's actually a collection of individuals, local governments, federal bodies, agencies, special interest groups and so on that collectively form the activity we call the United States government. The US government can both be at war and not at war. The US government often wars with itself. The incorporated aspects make some of these organizations people by law, but they're inherently like multiple personality disorder. (I know it's called DID, but i use MPD b\/c most people understand that term.) These issues are worth considering in your work because governments and corporations are key players in these things. So much that economists, psychologists and other academics try to make black\/white or precise with these types of organizations is actually more probabilistic\/fuzzy.\n\n\"So if you accept this you cannot use the term in this context without attribution! \"\n\nSince (a) Premise 1 can be stretched so far it looks thin and (b) Premise 2 is broken in numerous relevant contexts, so I cannot accept the conclusion that attribution is required.\n\nAttribution is sometimes not required at all, it's often useful, and sometimes it's necessary to make the best decision.\n\nDecent view. I've often said I learned about everything I need to know about people in high school. Sure, colleges, industries and certain groups dress up their social activities a bit. However, I find that underneath most of the motivations, tactics, personality types, etc. are either the same as or similar to what I encountered in high school. Our parents wanted us to focus on the classwork for our future. I think we would have been better off if we were pushed to master understanding the people in it. I certainly benefited from the effort I put into that.\n\nWhat is the old saying? It went along the lines that all kinds of things change, but people are always people.\n\nRe Clive comment\n\n\"@ Pigeonhole Principle,\n\nAll you needed to say there...\n\nWhat and break the habit of a life time ;-)\"\n\nLOL. Yes, Clive will probably keep the long winded, technical posts so people can identify the author in the event he forgets to type his name. ;)\n\n@NickP\nI think the referenced post made it very clear that I don't know what I'm talking about.\n\nBTW: this is a very dangerous subject to know too much about, so I'm very happy to maintain my ignorance.\n\nI'd just say one last thing: 12 story buildings are very useful for attacking with high gain antennas and wifi. the emergence of Ultrabooks with no Ethernet port, means that open wifi\/Ethernet bridge ports are appearing in even the most secure buildings, luckily the guys with the power to ignore the rules sit in the corner window offices.\n\n@CliveR\n\"And this gives us a fourth possability which is ineffect a reverse \"Honey net\" \"\n\n\"Reverse Honey nets\" What sneaky little so'n'so's, surely the US has passed a law against this sort of behavior, it's down right anti-social.\n\nI wonder if we would be reading this story if the attack had been traced to some hut in western Pakistan, maybe just a side note about a successful drone attack....so what makes China different? why do they think they can get away with ignoring the US's will?\n\nYes it is, there are places in London where WiFi just does not work due to the simple fact that the density of AP's exceeds any kind of usability.\n\nIf however you find yourself in London one day and fancy a visit to the Greenwich Observatory to visit the Meridian line (as many tourists do) glance across to the HSBC building and all those others surounding it and think hmm \"target rich environment\"...\n\nAs I know from experiance there are one heck of a lot of insecure networks etc over there, and some traffic would count as insider dealing....\n\nBut that's just the start of the possibilities, unfortunatly I lost my ignorance a long time ago and whilst clocks might become old and jaded with time they still tend not to go backwards :-(\n\nDude, you're doing a bit of disservice to the US here. Yeah, it may not be war in the traditional sense, but it is going to be 'death by a thousand cuts'. The major difference between normal 'economic espionage' and what we are seeing from China in this Mandiant report, is that these thefts appear to have the backing of the entire Chinese government, which ultimately controls the Chinese economy. This would be the equivalent of the NSA stealing information from BMW, and then giving that information to Ford or GM for economic benefit ... which is ridiculous. Now, perhaps shady characters in the automotive industry are engaging in such economic espionage against their competitors, but unlike what we see here, they do not have the backing of their government for this activity. In China, the government controls the banks, manufacturing, distribution, service, etc etc etc. Their plan in this regard is long-term, and they will win. Saying these attacks happen on the time and are the normal course of countries relationships with each other is BS. There is no way our US intel community is providing economically beneficial information to US companies. But that is what we see China doing here by targeting businesses across all sectors of the economy. You have an issue with the word 'war', fine. But don't downplay it. It's a game of Chess, and we are losing.\n\n.\n\nThe New York Times just has its panties in a bunch because they were attacked directly. They were happy to watch, and -- if they really had to -- report on, attacks on other targets for years ... but when it was their own assets, it became personal. That's why we see a media frenzy.\n\nI agree, we should expect better behavior from our news sources. They should have been reporting on Chinese attacks all along with the same consistency since, as Bruce said, the consistency and character of attacks hasn't changed.\n\nPerhaps that's just the way it is. It reminds me of the high-profile American journalist who admitted that, after another journalist had been killed by an Iraqi IED, it made the war \"real\" for them ... thus also admitting that seeing hundreds of American soldiers killed by such IED's didn't bring near the emotional connection.\n\nOr try Google: they weren't happy with their relationship with China, but they tried what they could. Then they caught China attacking their own assets (Gmail), and enough was enough. So they moved to Hong Kong.\n\n\".\"\n\nLet's be fair, here. This isn't an investigation of some normal business or agency with full LEO power. Mandiant was investigating an organization dedicated to covert operations without trying to subvert them, infiltrate them, or do other illegal activity. Most covert activities go untracked in entirety. Their designed to prevent attribution by LEO's with full power. Mandiant had a fraction of LEO capability, yet presented plenty of good evidence of the identity of APT attackers.\n\nI give them props for both great research and presenting it in a way even lay people can appreciate. Maybe errors will be found. Maybe their conclusion will turn out wrong. However, as far as covert organizations go, they have more information than you'd typically expect.\n\n@Nick P\nLet's take the Symantec reports on Stuxnet as a baseline. Symantec was\/is in the same position with regard to Stuxnet as Mandiant is with regard to APT1, and just as Kaspersky was\/is in the same position with regard to Red October.\nI read the three reports with great interest and certainly give credit to the Mandiant report for being an excellent introduction to hacking methodology for say a University course in hacking from the Law Enforcement and risk minimization perspective. Ditto the other two studies, which in some respects are just a little too technical to be good introductions.\nHowever, and here is my first point, of the three studies, only Mandiant's conveyed to me an air of commercial self-promotion. Maybe the other two reports were just as self-promotional but did it with a lighter hand but to me they seemed far more objectively scientific (\"Just the facts, Ma'am.\").\nSecond, Mandiant is making some very strong flat allegations that a series of hacks are the direct responsibility of Unit 61398 of the Chinese PLA. That's a pretty serious allegation with potential international repercussions. But what struck me was that the evidence was thinner than I expected. After all the mission of Unit 61398 is consistent with a defensive cyber mission and photographs of their headquarters carry as much weight for attribution of APT1 to them as photographs of Fort Meade carry for attribution of Stuxnet to the NSA.\n\nIt might have something to do with the $100 billion or so in US Treasuries that China buys each year or the $1 trillion in US debt that China holds or the hundred billion or so in foreign direct investment that China gets.\n\nMichael: The overall aim here wasn't to 'take down' an enemy. It was about economic gain through corporate espionage.\n\nI don't think this is the primary aim at all.... Ask yourself this, what possible economic gain could the Chinese government get by hacking the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, or the Washington Post. For that matter, what commercially useful information does the Chinese government get by hacking Facebook, Google, Twitter, or Apple?\n\nAnswer: None at all.... The only company that I've listed that has any commercially useful information is Apple and maybe Google, and if the PLA wants that, they can get it from Apple's Chinese suppliers.\n\nIt's not mainly a commercial spying operation, its a domestic security operation. The NYT does not have any technology information that the Chinese government would be interested in. Names of dissidents and confidential sources however......\n\nAlso, even without getting any information, the Ministry of State Security has done something useful. There is no chance now that any dissident in China is going to talk to the NYT.\n\nHong Kong is part of China, and it's an example of why the difference between the Chinese military and the civilian spying agencies is important.\n\nUnder Chinese law, the Chinese military has full power to conduct military operations in Hong Kong (they have a garrison and there a tall office in Admiralty).\n\nThe Chinese police and spying agencies don't. So if you have information that is of interest to the Chinese police (i.e. the names of dissidents) you can move your servers to Hong Kong and be safe. If you have information that is of interest to the Chinese military (plans for a high performance fighter or invasion plans), you have no safety at all of you move to HK, since the PLA has full national defense powers in HK.\n\n> You could consider this a type of economic war that removes the competitive advantage from U.S. businesses and drives more production of products to Chinese businesses.\n\nNo you can't.\n\nThe trouble is that this assumes that the world is separated nicely into US businesses and Chinese businesses when outside of a few industries it isn't. A lot of businesses headquartered in the US are in joint ventures and cross-licensing agreements with Chinese businesses, and US businesses often depend on China for profits. Conversely, you have Chinese businesses that are depend on the United States.\n\nThe other thing is that some industries are heavily \"networked\" in which any sort of production takes place across twenty or thirty countries.\n\nThe Chinese government owns a small portion of Apple, Coca-Cola, Morgan-Stanley, and Citibank.\n\n> . Until now, I had dismissed comments that the Chinese govt was involved as wild speculation.\n\nThat some agency of the Chinese government is hacking US computers is rather well known knowledge among anyone that has anything to do with China. Any group that has anything minimally to do with China has be the target of attempted hacking, and it's gone on for so long, that \"it's not news.\"\n\nThe fact that China does engage in both overt and covert methods for getting US technology is also *not news*. In fact, most high technology companies in the United States are heavily in the business of selling said technology to China.\n\nThe only reason it made it in the NYT is that they discovered that they were hacked. The only real question is \"which part of the Chinese government is doing the hacking and why?\" and I think that the NYT massively dropped the ball on this one because they aren't thinking clearly.\n\nOne point here is that misattributing attacks to the PLA is a bit dangerous. If you have low-grade information that is of interest to the Ministry of State Security, then you'll be able to get by with low-grade security. The MSS hackers will check if you've left your doors unlocked and if not, they'll move to another target. If you have high-grade information that the PLA really does care about, then you shouldn't have any machines connected to the internet at all\n\nI agree, we should expect better behavior from our news sources. They should have been reporting on Chinese attacks all along with the same consistency...\n\nPlease remember it's not just the Chinese but ALL capable nations...\n\nIt realy annoys me that it' \"China this\" and \"China that\" while everyone else gets a free pass in the Politicos and Journo's eyes, and it's extreamly damaging.\n\nOther major offenders are Russia and Israel (and most other Western Nations plus a whole heap more). We know they \"are at it\" atleast as much as China is supposed to be.\n\nThe fact that it's not reported has two serious consiquences,\n\n1, It blinds Sysadmins and their seniors all the way up into walnut corridor and above.\n\n2, It encorages lack of proper investigation.\n\nOf the two the second is currently the most worrying, because you have people who should know better talking about \"Cyber-War\" in one breath and \"Going Kinnetic\" in the next breath.\n\nWhilst I am by no means saying China is not cracking peoples security and systems I'm definatly saying they are but one of many, and ignoring\/hiding this fact is going to hurt us big time at some point unless we are very careful.\n\nIt's one of the reasons I'm very oposed to the idea of \"military and Quasi-military\" organizations being even remotly involved with Cyper-policing. The Military for all their worth in their respective roles have certain limitations and are unlikely to be impartial with respect to their other objectives for various reasons.\n\nAs has been pointed out on this blog a number of times in the past, the fact that the US Press and Journalists keeps banging on about China not only gives other countries a pass, it activly encorages them to use China as a smoke screen for their activities.\n\nThis would be the equivalent of the NSA stealing information from BMW, and then giving that information to Ford or GM for economic benefit ... which is ridiculous.\n\nSorry to burst your bubble but various national Intel organisations have been stealing \"commercialy sensitive\" information and handing it on to their own \"trusted\" rivals. It's a big fat part of what is covered by \"Economic National Security\"\n\nTthe head of the French bureau upset the apple cart years ago when being interviewd by a well known US news network and gave a very candid answer that R&D was expensive compared to spying.\n\nThe Russias are well known to have used spying on US commodity traders phones to manipulate the world grain price when their crops had failed thus saving billions of dollars.\n\nThe US once bugged a Japanese diplomatic plane when involved with a trade mission for purely economic data for negotiations.\n\nThe US are known to have spied on various other major defence electronics companies and supplied the intel to TRW.\n\nIt sometimes goes wrong, as seen once at the Paris Air Show where the Russian \"Koncordski\" rip off of the Franco-British Concorde crashed, it appears that a French fighter surveillance plane might have \"jet washed\" it and caused it to crash.\n\nWhen I used to work for a military communications equipment manufacture we used to discover strange interference happening when ever we were running trials for large National Contracts that the French were also bidding for. We tracked it down and found a group of technicians putting out jamming signals. The local police rounded them up but had to let them go because they had French CD passports.\n\nAs for Israel, per head of population they perform more theft of commercialy sensitive information than the Chinese do, and much of it mysteriously turns up in little start up companies who (unsurprisingly) have a Director or two who are Ex IDF \/ Mossad.\n\nWhen I used to work for an electronic lock company that was a major player in the Hotel industry, we got a slightly odd request from what was supposadly a part of IBM. I was suspicious and did some background checking. It turned out IBM had no such office etc. Further checking showed it was a front organisation. One of our employees was Jewish and he concluded after a further investigation that of the three or four people fronting the supposed IBM organisation they were all practicing Jews even though they spoke with accents from other nations. He demonstrated this in the office when we had a couple of them in, he deliberatly set up one of them with a glass of water that could easily be knocked over, and then at an appropriate time called out a warning softly in Hebrew, and the person fell into the trap... Further checking through other contacts showed that the supposed IBM company had been operating as a \"Technology Front\" for \"hotel security\" products. Basicaly Mossad needs such intel for carrying out various activities such as kidnaping and assasination.\n\nAnd yes even the UK Government has been caught out in the economic espionage game on more than one occassion. Basicaly the idea was \"Intel swaps\" a company that had trade links with \"certain nations of interest\" would get a discrete visit at director level asking if the companies sales reps going over to these nations could produce \"background information\" about what they saw. In return the company would get discrete information about forign competitors and various contracts that they would be considered \"prefered bidders\" on. Unfortunatly the cosy relationship went wrong with one company when the lose cannon that was UK Customs and Excise decided to prosecute them for what was in effect arms trading. It all went horribly wrong and quite a bit of info about these cosy relationships came out.\n\nIt is also well known that the NSA used to supply \"Special Advice\" to a Swiss Crypto company, we assume to put \"technical backdoors\" in the products they sold to various \"nations of interest\".\n\nExamination of US mechanical field cipher equipment showed it had issues in that some keys were strong whilst others weak. Further information sugests this was known to those who supplied US troops with their KeyMat. It has been suggested that any nation copying such devices (and quite a few did or purchased them through untill the 1970's) would be very likely to use the keys randomly thus use the weak with the strong and giving the likes of the NSA a nice little entry into the countries \"secret communications\".\n\nPut simply \"there is no moral high ground\" in espionage everyone spys on every one else when they can. The biggest constraint on such activities being financial and other resources. The number one country on supplying these resources in the past is the US to it's favourd agency that Never Say Anything...\n\nLikewis so was @stvs comment on being attacked from Taiwan AKA Republic of China (ROC) and famous for ripping of technology in the later part of the last century. For it was they who put \"China\" in the expression \"Chinese knock off\".\n\nI wonder if we would be reading this story if the attack had been traced to some hut in western Pakistan, maybe just a side note about a successful drone attack..\n\nAs it was tucked away beneath your other comment.\n\nYou actually raise an interesting point, both China and Pakistan are Nuclear States, so are assumed to sit politicaly on the same \"Top Table\".\n\nHowever China is not land locked and has proven long range rocket capability Pakistan however is land locked and does not have proven long range rocket capability....\n\nTherefor like any Super Power China can \"project power\" out to other super powers from subsea and space, whilst Pakistan cannot. Thus it could be said that as far as the US are concerned the top table has tiers and Packistan is on a lower one than China...\n\nWhich raises the question of how the US are going to treat North Korea, from now on... Now it would appear from the events of the past three months that N.Korea has rockets of \"Space launch capability\" for \"appropriate sized payloads\", and if commentators are to be believed a uranium based nuclear device that is under the appropriate sized payload. Thus could in theory drop one on Washington if they so wished... Likewise we also know that North Korea is not land locked and does have it's own submarine capabilities...\n\nHmm all of which is probably making a lot of people somewhat nervous as it means North Korea is within a hairs bredth or two of meeting one of the requirments for being a Super Power...\n\nAnother posted stated this.\n\"This would be the equivalent of the NSA stealing information from BMW, and then giving that information to Ford or GM for economic benefit ... which is ridiculous.\" Your examples of numerous other countries do not demonstrate what the US does. The US is different, according to Woolsey  Most of your examples of the NSA, without more details, could fall under their mission of gathering intelligence on foreign governments. Regarding Japan, there is a world of difference between spying on diplomatic trade negotiations and stealing trade secrets. You shouldn't equate the two.\n\nLikewis so was @stvs comment on being attacked from Taiwan AKA Republic of China (ROC)\n\nYes, a tongue-in-cheek comment, but I also expected that Mandiant's report would outline the geographic extent of APT1's C2s. Unsurprisingly, .tw represents one of the countries with the most servers outside .cn, only behind .us and .kr (Figure 23).\n\nAlso glaringly obvious from the report: APT1 is all about pwning Windows and Microsoft Exchange Server. Search in vain for keyword \"bsd\" \"unix\" \"linux\" \"os x\", or even \"apple\" in the context of privilege escalation tools, rather than decoy FQDNs. Just one example of Windows pwnage from Table 6:\n\nBoth events are economic espionage, but from the economic competition view, any analysis that doesn't delve into the types of economic espionage is superficial.\n\nFrom a privacy or civil libertarian perspective, very few people will be involved in trade negotiations at a high level, but almost anyone could work at private company developing something of commercial value.\n\nI'm not a military nomenclature expert, but I'm not sure one can clearly state this is not a \"war.\" It seems clear that there is primarily only information gathering at this point. However, in regard to the Chinese's use of that information, they are 100% acting on it. Not to do direct harm to people\/ infrastructure, like shutting off power and water systems, but they are using the information to do damage economically. Their government is stealing our IP, and giving it to Chinese private companies and SOEs. So there is serious harm done and this makes the current situation different in at least scale\/ impact than years past; in terms of the use of information from economic espionage. The PRC did not have the capability until relatively recently to act on the economic espionage that they have been gathering. Plus, as others have said, this is just a precursor to what is coming (with actual attacks on infrastructure).\n\nAlthough I'm not a military expert, I am a bit of a China expert. And anyone who knows the Chinese, knows that they will continue to escalate the situation until we stop them dead in their tracks. That is a fact, whether one likes it or not. I don't like \"vague\" exec orders or getting into a cyber arms race either, but the US certainly needs to do something more \"drastic\" in response to the situation. I think the developed world should put strong sanctions or threaten to pull the PRC out of the WTO. If people think it's too late to isolate China economically, as pressure to stop their cybercrimes, then we have already lost the real \"war\" that has yet to begin.\n\nIn follow-up to my last message: I suppose that if, like many wars that are based on a fight over resources, this is not much different in terms of definition. I would say that war has yet to be declared, but we are very close to it. A cyber arms race would be no different in escalating to declaration than a traditional arms race. So I understand your position. But what do we do? -It's the Chinese we're talking about here.\n\nThis is not like a traditional war where shots get fired and a declaration of war is made. There will be massive amounts of economic carnage before then (there probably already has been). The slight plausibility that China's denials are true give them an out to justify what they are doing. They are not going to stop, until someone stops them. When the US & allies try stopping them, through sanctions, etc. China will point the finger and retaliate, and the escalation to war starts. I might argue that our government knows the Chinese mindset as well as I do, and that they have already decided that a cyber arms race is the best approach. At least then we have a chance to defend our infrastructure.\n\nI don't see a good ending here. If you didn't know, there is never a win-win situation with the Chinese. They believe they can only win if you lose. \uf04c"}

The collector should be confident about the security of the system used for storage and analysis of the copied evidence. Only after this step, is it beneficial to unplug or shut down the affected system. If the affected system is saving logs on a remote server, copy them as well, they are less likely to be compromised by the attack. In Linux, programs could still be running even after their files have been deleted. You can search for such programs with the command: file \/proc\/[0-9]*\/exe|grep \"(deleted)\" .

In addition, a common centre will also increase collaboration between all the countries and allow them to share information. Information sharing has become one of the key weapons against cybercrime.\n\nOf the five functions listed, I believe the last one on outreach is going to be the most significant. Information sharing between government agencies may happen to an extent, but we all need to share information including the private sector. And, although this is something that many countries in Europe including the UK have tried to put in place, a central unit in Europe that works closely with the private sector to understand the threat landscape and share data is definitely a big step in the right direction."}

As many of us spend a considerable amount of time online, being aware of these threats can help safeguard valuable data.\n\nStolen, Spoofed Certificates\n\nOne major issue the article focuses on is stole or faked certificates. Certificates are utilized by websites that you log into, like your bank, that prove the site can be trusted. In 2011 the faking of these was a popular strategy employed by cyber-criminals and it is thought to be a continuing problem in 2012.\n\nA Common Security Mechanism in Trouble?\n\nThe use of certificates as a security mechanism is the most common method used currently. If the trustworthiness of these are put into question then that will spell trouble for all computer users including large companies who are accountable for protecting confidential data.\n\nAnother common security challenge is what is referred to as \"Hacktivism\". Cyber-criminals look at this as activism through hacking, hence the name. Organizations like Anonymous and LulzSec target large companies that they believe are guilty of wrongdoing. They also target companies to show the susceptibility and weakness of them. Technology Review believes that groups like these will continue \"hacktivism\" for a long time.\n\nHome Automation\n\nIn 2012 another security risk is the growing popularity of home automation.

But these days your traditional zombie has a rival \u2013 not exactly a clone, but a modern version with equally nasty habits.\n\nWhere the original zombie was said to be typically a reanimated corpse or a human being controlled by someone else by use of magic, today's computer version is controlled by cyber criminals who are usually after your bank, social network or webmail credentials.\n\nTraditional zombies originated in the West African spiritual belief system of voodoo, and became a popular device in modern horror fiction, largely because of the successful 1968 film Night of the Living Dead.\n\nFour decades later, we are still fighting zombies. The computer variety connects to the Internet after an innocent user's PC has being compromised by a hacker, computer virus or malicious software called a trojan. Usually, a compromised machine is one of many in a botnet, which will be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction.\n\nMost zombie-infected computer owners are unaware that their system is being used in this way. This lack of awareness is why such computers are compared to traditional zombies.\n\nThe modern zombies have been growing in strength and power over recent times. The bad news for their victims is that today's industrialised hackers are demystifying two zombie myths: (1) zombies are uncoordinated, and (2) zombies are slow.\n\nWith just a few clicks, a hacker can issue command and controls (C&Cs) to waken a group of zombies. This group then becomes part of the attacker's 'botnet' \u2013 a cyber-army under his\/her control. The attacker then issues different C&Cs to the botnet to perform the required cyber-attack.\n\nA major goal of these botnets is to probe Web application vulnerabilities and extract valuable data, such as:\n\nSocial network credentials to hijack a victim's profile and scrape their friend list and send out spam.\n\nWebmail account credentials to gain personal information on the individual for spear-phishing.\n\nThe bottom line is, beware of zombies because today's sophisticated hackers can conduct fully muscular attack campaigns, using a corporate 'dashboard' detailing attack movements and advancements, within an hour!\n\nHow do you fight a computer zombie? Avoid being the next victim, use common sense. If a link seems too good, don't click.

{"text":"In the online struggle for network security, Kansas State University cybersecurity experts are adding an ally to the security force: the computer network itself.\n\nScott DeLoach, professor of computing and information sciences, and Xinming \"Simon\" Ou, associate professor of computing and information sciences, are researching the feasibility of building a computer network that could protect itself against online attackers by automatically changing its setup and configuration.\n\nDeLoach and Ou were recently awarded a five-year grant of more than $1 million from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research to fund the study \"Understanding and quantifying the impact of moving target defenses on computer networks.\" The study, which began in April, will be the first to document whether this type of adaptive cybersecurity, called moving-target defense, can be effective. If it can work, researchers will determine if the benefits of creating a moving-target defense system outweigh the overhead and resources needed to build it.\n\nHelping Ou and DeLoach in their investigation and research are Kansas State University students Rui Zhuang and Su Zhang, both doctoral candidates in computing and information sciences from China, and Alexandru Bardas, doctoral student in computing and information sciences from Romania.\n\nAs the study progresses the computer scientists will develop a set of analytical models to determine the effectiveness of a moving-target defense system. They will also create a proof-of-concept system as a way to experiment with the idea in a concrete setting.\n\n\"It's important to investigate any scientific evidence that shows that this approach does work so it can be fully researched and developed,\" DeLoach said. He started collaborating with Ou to apply intelligent adaptive techniques to cybersecurity several years ago after a conversation at a university open house.\n\nThe term moving-target defense -- a subarea of adaptive security in the cybersecurity field -- was first coined around 2008, although similar concepts have been proposed and studied since the early 2000s. The idea behind moving-target defense in the context of computer networks is to create a computer network that is no longer static in its configuration. Instead, as a way to thwart cyber attackers, the network automatically and periodically randomizes its configuration through various methods -- such as changing the addresses of software applications on the network; switching between instances of the applications; and changing the location of critical system data.\n\nOu and DeLoach said the key is to make the network appear to an attacker that it is changing chaotically while to an authorized user the system operates normally.\n\n\"If you have a Web server, pretty much anybody in the world can figure out where you are and what software you're running,\" DeLoach said. \"If they know that, they can figure out what vulnerabilities you have. In a typical scenario, attackers scan your system and find out everything they can about your server configuration and what security holes it has. Then they select the best time for them to attack and exploit those security holes in order to do the most damage. This could change that.\"\n\nCreating a computer network that could automatically detect and defend itself against cyber attacks would substantially increase the security of online data for universities, government departments, corporations and businesses -- all of which have been the targets of large-scale cyber attacks."}
{"text":"Posted\nby\nSoulskillon Friday August 03, 2012 @02:17PM from the 72%-of-statistics-are-made-up dept.\n\nwiredmikey sends this excerpt from SecurityWeek:\n\"A recent article on ProPublica dissected two commonly quoted figures about cybersecurity: $1 trillion in losses due to cybercrime itself and $388 million in IP losses for American companies. Both figures have been scrutinized and challenged by many, and viewed as typical security vendor FUD. ... The $1 trillion figure is attributed to anti-virus vendor McAfee, while the $388 million in IP losses number belongs to Symantec's Norton division. According to ProPublica, 'The report was not actually researched by Norton employees; it was outsourced to a market research firm, StrategyOne, which is owned by the public relations giant Edelman.' The problem with both of these figures \u2014 $1 trillion and $388 million \u2014 is, as Microsoft researchers pointed out earlier this year in a report fittingly titled 'Sex, Lies, and Cybercrime,' they are studded with outliers. In one example they cite that a single individual who claims $50,000 losses, in an N = 1000 person survey, is enough to extrapolate a $10 billion loss over the population. In another, one unverified claim of $7,500 in phishing losses translates into $1.5 billion over the population. The Microsoft researchers concluded: 'Are we really producing cyber-crime estimates where 75% of the estimate comes from the unverified self-reported answers of one or two people? Unfortunately, it appears so. Can any faith whatever be placed in the surveys we have? No, it appears not.'\"\n\nObviously, the $1 trillion figure is made up. The real figure is more likely in the tens of millions, maybe a little higher, but probably even less than that. The thing is, and the reason people can get away with citing a number that ridiculous, is because it is so large. People simply have no concept of scale that large. You can't hold a number that large in your head, not insofar as it applies to something real. As a pure number, sure, but not as a number of something. The human brain can comprehend tens, even thousands: but trillions are simply too large for the mind to hold, which means that as a talking point, a couple billion is about the same as a trillion for your average human: it basically just ends up meaning \"a really really really lot.\"\n\nIf you approach rebuking the number as \"well what should the number really be\", you aren't countering the key point behind those figures, which is simply to express a massive quantity. If you respond by saying the number should really be in the millions, people will usually scoff at you (\"no way McAfee could have been that wrong\") or at best simply take the average of the two numbers, which still yields a massive number in their head. The point of such studies isn't to be scientific: it's to be rhetorical. So ultimately, to the people citing that number, it doesn't matter in the slightest if it is true, or how it was a arrived at. All it matters is they have a really big number to cite that they can say is \"scientific\" or \"proof that we need to take action.\"\n\nIf the losses are really only in the millions, how is there a market for zero-day exploits of ~$50k each? To engage in your average criminal activity, you need at least a 10:1 payout for something low-risk logically. If the packaged exploit is half the cost of executing the scam, your average zero-day should gross $1MM. Isn't it easier to skim $100k from a brokerage account than mine bit coins?\n\nOf course, your average criminal isn't too good at math, but it hardly seems that difficult to cast a big enough\n\nObviously, the $1 trillion figure is made up. The real figure is more likely in the tens of millions, maybe a little higher, but probably even less than that.\n\nWait a minute now. The derivatives market by itself, is close to $800Trillion. That's \"trillion\" with a \"T\" and represents a sum that equals many times more than the GDP of the entire world.\n\nThe manipulation of Libor and stealing by simply timing the rate changes could easily have represented $1Trillion in crime.\n\nAdd to that the investment banks using their position to do high-frequency trading, in effect \"peeking\" at their customer transactions to jump in front (yes, that's a crime) and all the rest of the straight up fraud and theft that is being perpetrated by the big banks thanks to their proximity to the Federal Reserve and we've left $1Trillion in cybercrime about five miles back.\n\nYou make the mistake of thinking that \"cybercrime\" can only be Balkan hackers or credit card scammers - small time fraudsters. The real cybercrime is being perpetrated by our financial elite on a scale that makes them absolutely untouchable - out of the reach of any government. Hell, the medicare fraud by the company owned by the governor of Florida, Rick Scott, caused them to pay a fine of a billion dollars, which means the amount they stole using their computer medicare billing system is well over that amount. That's certainly cyber-crime.\n\nThen look at the $27trillion being held illegally off-shore by American citizens to evade taxes (also a crime and also made possible thanks to computers) and the figure of what could be called \"cybercrime\" adds up to more than the total GDP of the United States and Japan combined. To give you an idea of the impunity with which this illegal (as in crime) activity is engaged, one of the people who almost certainly took advantage of the 2009 amnesty by which these tax cheats could repatriate their money to the US without facing criminal prosecution is now running for president.\n\nIf you just take the cases of cybercrime that the biggest banks have already settled with the Justice Department, you get way over $1trillion.\n\nIt's silly to think that the $1 trillion figure is \"made up\". Just look at the deal that's being cut in regard to the massive amount of mortgage fraud. The amounts there are what, 700, 800 million dollars?\n\nOf course, the lawyers tell their clients, when settling for pennies on the dollar, to \"admit no wrongdoing\" but to pay up anyway because they committed the crimes\n\nI can't even remember what comes after \"trillion\". Is it \"quadrillion\"? Well the derivatives market, that shadow market that is tied to absolutely nothing real - not equities, not bonds, stocks, nothing but money in the hands of a tiny number of people, nothing that adds a goddamn thing to society, and we're bumping right up against that quadrill\n\nYou are quite wrong. The discrete quantities the human brain can quickly recognize are much smaller than that.\n\nThink of people in a room; you enter a room and you see 3 people. You don't have to think for a second, you know it's 3 people, instantly. The same with 4. Perhaps 5. After 6 people, you might not realize, but, as you count them, you'll probably be counting in groups of 3 or 4. Everything above 6 or 7 you only estimate (e.g.: \"there were *about* 15 people in that room\"), unless you actually take tim\n\nThrow that one guy out as a strange \"outlier\" and the number is zero. That is more believeable.\n\nLies, damn lies and statistics. Grarbage in garbage out.\n\nIf it was only one person out of a full one thousand sample then the sample size is way to small to be statistically significant. Whoever did the statistical analysis should be fired. With that low a report rate you don't know it is 1\/1e6 or 1\/1e9 and you just got unlucky in the sample.\n\nYou're part of the problem. Lies and fraud should not be tolerated, regardless of whether it's someone's \"job\". It's wrong, and causes damage to society by misleading people and ultimately tricking them into parting with their money.\n\nIt is not only cyber-crime estimates that are coming from one or two self-reported unverified people. All the economy related numbers are made up, reverse engineered, adjusted to fit the narrative of the political power.\n\n1 Trillion USD losses to cyber-crime? So taking the 15 Trillion GDP figure at face value (which you must not make mistake of doing), it means that over 6% of the GDP is lost due to all this 'cyber-crime'. 6%. The entire USA agriculture sector is 4% of the reported GDP.\n\nWell, in this case, it is basically Microsoft defending itself against the FUD from Norton, because the only reason you should need Norton is if Microsoft Windows sucks. So Microsoft will attempt to minimize the reported cybercrime numbers because it reflects poorly on them.\n\nI'm not saying Microsoft is wrong in their analysis here, in fact I think they are correct, but you cannot say that Microsoft is \"helping\" anybody but themselves by exposing the FUD. I highly doubt that they would help expose any FUD a\n\nSomething like, $1 trillion with a 90% confidence interval of [$1000, $2 trillion] would have been completely honest:-)\n(this is the kind of confidence interval you would get using the bootstrap method on the kind of data they describe, i.e. data with one huge outlier).\n\nIf they are including spyware\/virus in their \"cybercrime\" definition, the numbers make sense.\n\nConsider this:\n\nI've got a customer who had two of their machines taken out by viruses. At a billable rate of $180\/hour, it took approximately 10-12 hours to try the cleaning solutions (which of course did not work) and then reformat and reinstall Windows and the five-million updates to updates to updates. So that's just two occurrences in one week costing the client $4,000.00 for actions due in large part to whoever\n\n... sheesh, they could have found a guy on Craigslist that would have immediately jumped to the \"gotta reinstall windows\" solution for $40 a pop.\n\n\"Just the annual cost for this one company alone could justify extrapolating the seemingly over-inflated costs of cybercrime.\"\n\nNo, your overinflated $180\/hr billing rate is as much to blame for this one as does milking the client for money. Seriously, as someone that does AV cleanup as part of my security duties for a large global company I gotta call bullshit on yo\n\n... enough to show me just how bad you are at your job. Your industry average of $250\/hr is complete bs; a number pulled out of your ass to justify raping this company due to their own ignorance. I understand, it's your cash cow and you will do anything to protect your interests, but right now you look like a used car salesman from the 80's; lying to the customer just to make a buck.\n\n... no matter what you say, or how you try to justify it, you're still giving it to them with no Vaseline or even so much as a reach around or peck on the cheek. The only reason you're still in business is because you found a sucker of a company and are milking them to make your BMW payments.\n\nOne can get an H1B Indian consultant to stand up an SAP BobJ instance on SUSE 10 for around $160\/hr right now and he\/she will sit in your office to do the job, you can get them for that much to do a wide range of things\n\nI do agree, that his rate seems to be a bit inflated, especially if he has an ongoing relationship with his client.\n\nBut \"Robert Half\"?

Or will the Temp have to Google his way out of your predicament?

They have been buying onesy\/twosy machines since slooooooowly transitioning from Wyse serial terminals into the PC world.\n\nMost of the people who commented on this portion of the main post should really sit down and watch Glengarry, Glenn Ross: \"Never open your mouth when you don't know the shot\".

We do NOT deal with the biggest banks, mostly regional and local banks.

{"text":"share this story\n\nRemember what your mother used to tell you about not speaking to strangers? Well in this technology-enhanced aged this sentiment also applies to your social media accounts.\n\nSocial media networks might just be an online forum to keep in touch with your friends and family but to enterprising cyber criminals they are a potentially huge opportunity. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter have boomed over the past couple of years, boasting millions of users all of whom are constantly updating their personal information, which is highly valuable for today's cyber criminal. The more information hackers are able to get a hold of, the easier it will be to develop an attack and the greater the return will be.\n\nThe mechanics of a social media related attack are simple: cyber criminals hone in on their targets and gather as much information as they can by befriending them, subsequently enabling access to their profile. Once the initial contact is made, hackers will launch their attack in the form of a malware laced attachment or link that has been developed with the victim in mind - increasing credibility and the likelihood of that individual clicking on the link. Once the link is opened the attacker will launch a quiet attack, accessing the victim's device along with all their personal information.\n\nBy following a few simple rules and tips, when interacting on social networks, individuals will be able to diminish the probability of a potentially devastating attack.\n\nTop tips include:\n\n\u2022 Do not accept invitations from people you don't know even if the requestor is friends with someone in your network.\n\u2022 Take full advantage of the privacy settings most social networks offer and ensure information you post can only be seen by those you have accepted into your network. Be cognizant of the information that you post on your social media accounts.\n\u2022 Be suspicious and cautious about information that is sent from people you don't know, especially if it contains more personal information than you would have shared with them.\n\u2022 Avoid leaving clues to security questions you may have established on other more sensitive sites such as online banking - for example, the city of your birth, your mother's maiden name.\n\u2022 Bring a healthy dose of suspicion to any online interaction, looking out for something that may be odd - report any suspicious behavior, as you would in the real world.\n\nThese simple precautions are the first step towards making social networks a safer environment for yourself and the rest of your network."}

{"text":"'Computer nerd' UFO hunter wins extradition battle\n\nGary McKinnon (Reuters)\n\nA British computer hacker's decade-long struggle to avoid trial in the US over alleged breaches of military and NASA networks ended in success Tuesday, as the UK government ruled he was unfit to face charges there.\n\nHome Secretary Theresa May said she had blocked the US request to extradite Gary McKinnon after medical experts concluded he was seriously depressed and that there was \"a high risk of him ending his life\".\n\nThe 46-year-old unemployed computer administrator, who has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, was accused of one of the largest ever breaches of\n\nmilitary networks, carried out soon after the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.\n\n\"He couldn't speak, he cried, then we hugged, then we cried again,\" his mother Janis Sharp said, describing the moment she and McKinnon learned of his reprieve.\n\nBritish prosecutors will now decide if he should face charges in the UK.\n\nWHAT DID THE HACKER CLAIM?\n\nMcKinnon insists that he was scouring sensitive US US\".\n\nHe had offered to plead guilty to a hacking charge in Britain in order to avoid extradition. Prosecutors turned him down, insisting the US was the correct venue for a trial.\n\nWHAT WAS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S CASE?\n\nUS officials said McKinnon's hacking shut down the US Army district responsible for protecting Washington, DC, and caused about US$900,000 worth of damage. He was also accused of clearing logs from computers at Naval Weapons Station Earle in northern New Jersey, which tracks the location and battle-readiness of US Navy ships.\n\nAt the time of McKinnon's indictment, prosecutor Paul McNulty said he had pulled off \"the biggest hack of military computers ever, at least ever detected\".\n\nProsecutors rejected the hacker's claim to have been hunting for signs of UFOs, pointing to a note McKinnon left on an Army computer, in which he derided US foreign policy as \"akin to government-sponsored terrorism\".\n\nMcKinnon was caught in 2002 when investigators traced software used in the attacks to his girlfriend's email account.\n\nWHAT DID MCKINNON'S DEFENDERS SAY?\n\nSupporters of McKinnon had insisted that he was unfit to be extradited to the US, because he has suffered with depression and is a suicide risk. They had argued that McKinnon was an eccentric but harmless man who had no malicious intent. \"Gary is a classic computer nerd,\" his lawyer Karen Todner told BBC radio Tuesday.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron - who had championed McKinnon's case since before taking power - raised the issue repeatedly with US President Barack Obama, most recently during talks in March. \"It was an incredibly brave decision to stand up to another nation,\" McKinnon's mother Janis Sharp told reporters.\n\nLawmaker David Burrowes, who represents McKinnon's London neighbourhood, said May should be credited with \"saving my constituent Gary McKinnon's life\". Burrowes had threatened to quit his junior government post if the extradition was approved.\n\nWHAT IS THE IMPACT OF HIS CASE?\n\nIn light of the McKinnon case, the UK government said it would seek major changes to rules governing extradition between Britain and the US.\n\nLawyers have complained that under \"fast track\" extradition procedures introduced after the September 11 attacks, the US is not required to offer substantial proof of an allegation when seeking to extradite a suspect from Britain.\n\nMay said she will seek to grant British courts new powers to refuse US extradition requests. If the alleged crime involved took place mainly in the UK, a court could decide that a prosecution should take place in Britain, rather than the US.\n\nNigel.

When I explain the conferences and activities such as penetration testing and lock picking to those outside of the security community, I get a similar responses such as \"isn't that illegal?\" When I try to explain that it depends on intent, it only confuses them more.\n\nI have experience working with law enforcement and one topic that comes up often is the fine line between \"cop and criminal\". This makes sense, as the good detective needs to think like a criminal to catch a criminal, this rings particularly true in computer security. When I tried to explain what a gray hat hacker is to my father who is a big Clint Eastwood fan, I said they 're a bit like Dirty Harry ( some more so than others), only armed with \"the most powerful security tools in the world\" instead of a magnum . The methods may be unorthodox and on the fringe, but the intentions are for the most part good, get the bad guy and keep the world safe.\n\nUsually when there is a large scale hack in the news the grey hat is more interested in the \"how\" than the \"why\". There is a respect for the \"black hat's\" technical abilities, while still keeping a wary eye and not turning their back on them. Some grey hats have had run ins with the law, not due to purposely being malicious, but because curiosity got the best of them. A good example of this is Joe \"Kingpin\" Grand who presented at ToorCamp this summer, who while young had some legal trouble due to his \"technical curiosity\", turned around and has become a prolific inventor, hardware hacker and has testified before the Senate regarding homeland computer security.\n\nWhen looking at those in the security field who spend countless hours scouring applications and servers for holes, it is important to not judge based on their act of exposing vulnerabilities, but their intentions for doing so. In many respects the security community holds ethics very high, more so than many other industries and I am amazed at how much effort and pride researchers put into their work.

And like almost any other neighborhood, it can be dangerous. In the real world most of us intuitively know the do's and don'ts of staying reasonably safe: don't take candy from a stranger, don't flash loads of cash, etc. We know this from experience and from what our parents have taught us.\n\nUnfortunately, in the brave new world of the Internet, things are not as straightforward. The underlying reason why this is the case is that our perception of what is happening inside our computers is very limited. For example, if somebody was trying to steal your wallet, you would be able to see it and feel it. If, on the other hand, a hacker is stealing credit card information from your computer, you may find out about this months later.\n\nSo how do you minimize your chances of being a victim of computer crime? One of the best things to start with, is to realize that some online behaviors are much more risky than others. For example, using file sharing software, such as Morpheus or LimeWire virtually guarantees a spyware infection, unless your computer is equipped with industrial-strength security software that is properly configured and up to date."}
{"text":"Cyber Security Challenge 2011: the government and business puts faith in young cyber-warriors\n\nThe explosion in internet use, and the almost complete reliance on computer systems to run and record our daily lives, has opened up endless opportunities for thieves, spies and vandals to exploit the platform. The government recognised the potential threats to the nation's critical national infrastructure and therefore commissioned the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. The review made the threats from cyberspace a \"tier one\" priority, because Downing Street considered them a genuine threat to national security. Though much maligned at the time, this review is now regarded slightly more positively and is seen as the tipping point in the fight back against hackers, organised crime and terrorism. Over the course of the last 18 months the Office of Cyber Security & Information Assurance (OCSIA) has been looking at new ways to fight this global threat and protect the UK's critical national infrastructure.\n\nThe OCSIA has determined that one of the most effective ways of shoring up cyber defences is by recruiting an army of computer specialists to defend the systems from being attacked; the so-called youthful cyber-warriors. So the OCSIA came up with the concept of the Cyber Security Challenge in 2011. The Challenge looks to encourage the public, particularly young teenagers to enter competitions to develop ways to promote cyber security. Cyber Security Challenge UK is a series of national competitions aiming to find talented people who can promote cyber security. The challenge is backed by leading industry players including HP, Sophos, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, RSA and Symantec.\n\n'Can you talk security' is the latest competition in the Challenge, and is supported by both BT and Get Safe Online. The aim of the competition is to test the competitors' ability to communicate good security practice to others. It is hoped that the greater publicity this will bring to the issue will increase attention of the risks posed to small and medium-sized businesses by cyber threats, and will encourage all parties to take simple yet practical steps to protect themselves in the future.\n\nCybercrime costs UK businesses billions of pounds a year, with a recent Cabinet Office survey estimating the annual cost at around \u00a327 billion. Cyber Security Challenge UK says industry experts believe huge savings could be made across all sectors of the UK by improving awareness of basic good security practice. Cyber Security Challenge UK says the competition aims to tackle \"a critical and costly unawareness amongst UK small business owners and office workers about their vulnerability to cybercrime\". The competition also hopes to identify \"a new generation of creative communicators\" who can move into cyber security, where their skills are in high demand.\n\n\"It only needs one brilliant idea to resonate with people across the country to make a huge difference to their own security and the UK's as a whole.\"\n\nThe winning submission will be announced at BT Tower in London in November this year. Winners will then have the opportunity to work with a team of digital professionals and marketing experts who will launch the campaign nationwide."}

The project's developers are excited, but doubters say it's not going to fly.\n\nA group of computer enthusiasts have begun working on creating a satellite network that could be used to thwart censorship on the Internet.\n\nCalled the \"Hackerspace Global Grid\" (HGG), the network could provide a way for activists to access the Net when a repressive regime suppresses access within its borders.\n\nThe network would be based on a number of low orbiting \"cube\" satellites that would be networked in a way similar to the Internet. If one satellite were to be disabled, for example, its functions could be rerouted to others in the network.\n\nVarious amateur and educational organizations -- HAM radio operators, for example -- have found ways to get their cube satellites in orbit, and the hacker grid hopes to use those methods, as well as others, to get its spacecraft in low orbit too, according to Nick Farr, a hacker and accountant who is working on the project.\n\nCube Sat Explosion\n\n\"What we're seeing right now is a big explosion in people launching cube sats,\" Farr told TechNewsWorld.\n\nThose satellites are small, have a near-earth orbit and have a small communication window with base stations on the ground.\n\nTo get a cube sat in the sky, amateur satellite launchers typically piggyback their bird on a bigger payload, Farr explained. Oftentimes launchers have more rocket than they need for their payload because of security, safety or some other reason. \"So they'll have room for lots of smaller payloads that they can detach in near earth orbit,\" Farr said.\n\nThe HGG is now at its infancy stage. One of the first problems it has to solve is how to track the low orbiting satellites from the ground.\n\nHigh orbiting satellites, like those used for telecommunications and geographic positioning, have a fixed position in the sky. That makes them easy to find from the ground.\n\nThe position of low orbiting satellites is more variable. What's more, they're moving fast, so the window for finding one and maintaining a connection to it is short.\n\nCellphone Net in Space\n\nWhat the HGG is doing now is establishing a network of base stations around the world. Those stations won't be limited to tracking satellites, according to Armin Bauer, one of the lead hackers on the project.\n\n\"The first goal is to have the stations being able to track various things, for example airplanes, satellites, weather information,\" he told TechNewsWorld. \"For various science fields, a large distributed sensor array is a good way to measure data.\"\n\nOnce the stations in the grid reach a certain critical mass, it would be possible for a network of low-orbiting satellites to be used much the way a cellular network operates. In a cellular network, calls are handed off to towers as a phone moves. With HGG, a communication link would be handed off from station to station as the satellite moves.\n\n\"We plan to have quite a lot of those stations distributed over the planet's whole surface, thus the grid can be used with these satellites since a satellite will always be in radio range of a ground station,\" Bauer explained.\n\nSidestepping Censors\n\nOnce the network is up and running, anyone could tap into it and reach the Internet from anywhere. \"The whole point of it is to connect back to the global network to a place that's not as censored,\" Farr observed. So a person in China, for example, could link to the HGG and connect to the Internet through Germany or Japan and sidestep the domestic restrictions on their access.\n\n\"What they're doing is really cool and has a lot of interesting goals,\" Josh King, technology lead with the New America Foundation, told TechNewsWorld.\n\nThe foundation's Open Technology Initiative supports efforts to set up communication networks on the neighborhood, community and municipal level.\n\n\"They're creating a satellite network to connect people all over the world,\" King noted. \"An endpoint of one of those satellite links might be an individual or a community network. Our project is building those community networks.\"\n\nLame Scheme\n\nCreating a new satellite network is an ambitious project -- too ambitious in some people's minds.\n\n\"Satellite connections are expensive and slow,\" Tor Project development director Karen Reilly told TechNewsWorld. \"It will take a lot of work to make this a more viable option.\"\n\nThe Tor Project offers free software that allows people to communicate anonymously on the Internet.\n\n\"This is the lamest scheme I have ever seen,\" Richard Stiennon, chief research analyst with IT-Harvest, told TechNewsWorld.\n\n\"The guys proposing this spouted off way before they put any thought into it,\" he said. \"Give them points for dreaming big, but this project is going to need big dollars.\"\n\nA satellite the size of Sputnik could contain enough equipment to allow text over IP communications along the lines of Twitter, he acknowledged. \"But the cost would be over (US)$20 million to launch just one, and you would need almost 100 of them to give good coverage,\" he said."}

But they continued to go on about the \"video\". This is to prime the people to be on board to support what's coming, which is absolute takeover. This is High Treason. The UN is evil, and they should not have control of anything in this country or in the world. Do your homework because we are running out of time on many levels. It began with Rockefeller bill S773. The libtards in the Senate passed it right thru, but thank God, the house didn't. Rockefeller is the UN is the Illuminati, is Monsanto, and much more.

{"text":"Tag Archives: cyber attacks\n\nIn today's modern web world, a denial-of service (DoS) attack can take down an entire website in a matter of minutes. According to a report by security and network management vendors Prolexic and Arbor Networks, these types of attacks are on the rise, and were recently one of the key forms of attacks in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's investigation on America's water and energy utilities constant cyber-espionage. Whether a governmental organization or business, these types of attacks need to be on everyone's radar.\n\nWhile DoS attacks themselves are nothing new, new techniques and technologies in DoS attacks can be more aggressive than their predecessors and require a different kind of approach to network security. This blog will explain what's different about these new attacks, how best to approach them and identify measures that are no longer successful in combating them.\n\nA quick history of DoS\/DDoS\/AppDoS\nThe goal of any Denial of Service attack is simply to overwhelm a service to the point where it no longer works. This is typically done via brute force methods mixed with varying degrees of cleverness.\n\nA \"classic\" example of a DoS attack is SYN flooding which attacks a (web) server directly by starting a conversation at the TCP layer, but never finishing it. The attack was effective because there were relatively few resources on servers for partially-open connections. Solutions initially focused on protecting web servers with a proxy server (or security appliance) in front of the real server. These proxies would validate remote clients by ensuring that the TCP 3-way handshake completed into a full connection. The \"real\" solution came with server OS fixes to reinforce the weaknesses exploited by the DoS.\n\nThe next major advance in DoS technology was Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), in which large numbers of attackers simultaneously targeted a single service. The coordinated nature of the attack comes from botnets, which are composed of PCs infected by a worm, Trojan, or virus designed to make the PC an unwitting attacker. The infected PCs typically monitor a location on the Internet, looking for orders to attack. The real game changer in DDoS is that the large numbers of attackers can simply use brute force to overwhelm the network resources around a server. Placing a proxy or firewall in front of a server is an ineffective defense if the WAN link itself is flooded. Defense here usually requires either coordinating with the WAN provider to block addresses upstream, or moving the service to a hosting provider with enough bandwidth to simply absorb a DDoS.\n\nIn an interesting twist, self-proclaimed \"hacktivist\" groups like \"Anonymous\" have evangelized DDoS as a method of protest. Rather than using botnets of infected PCs, these groups are providing \"opt-in\" tools \u2013 although some versions of these tools provide no later method to opt back out or even uninstall.\n\nThe latest approach in DoS is following the trends of attackers in moving up the stack to applications. Application Denial of Service (AppDoS) uses vulnerabilities in specific server applications to create high-impact DoS with very low attack bandwidth. Whereas DDoS relied almost purely on brute force to overwhelm infrastructure, AppDoS shows a return to the cleverness of the original DoS. What makes AppDoS so effective is that application-specific vulnerabilities use layer 7 attacks. While these attacks will not work on every server, they use the regular behavior of lower-layer protocols like TCP, which makes them harder to detect. A true AppDoS attack on a web server would even use a well-formed HTTP request. Attacks of this kind include Slowloris, which only works against Apache.\n\nThe author of the Slowloris tool has provided some excellent points of comparison about why it's a new generation attack tool. Compared, to first generation DoS, \"This is NOT a TCP DoS, because it is actually making a full TCP connection, not a partial one; however it is making partial HTTP requests. It's the equivalent of a SYN flood but over HTTP.\" Also, compared to brute force DDoS methods, \"Slowloris is also NOT a GET request flooder. Slowloris requires only a few hundred requests at long term and regular intervals, as opposed to tens of thousands on an ongoing basis.\"\n\nThe new approach to DoS attacks versus the old\nAs stated before, today's DDoS attacks aren't just against servers, but also against the network infrastructure. A firewall can only protect what's behind it, so if it's on-premise, it can't prevent the WAN links from being flooded. Instead, to properly respond to a DDoS attack, network administrators need to coordinate with their WAN carrier to try and block the traffic upstream. There is a category of service provider offering \"clean pipe\" hosting with automatic DDoS squelching, but it's often more cost effective to simply move externally-visible servers to a host with enough bandwidth to absorb DDoS attacks invisibly.\n\nSecondly, the attack is going to come from a large number of IP addresses. These attackers will likely be a mix of botnets and self-proclaimed hacktivists. With an influx of this size, it is virtually impossible to add entries by hand for each node you are trying to block. In response you may want to try and filter aggregated blocks of addresses, but remember that the nature of botnets implies that the addresses will be widely dispersed rather than clustered together\u2014so a lot of legitimate traffic could potentially be blocked as well. Rate limiting may be useful for brute-force DDoS, identifying each attacker by its aggressive connection rate, and automatically blocking. However, AppDoS attacks can evade rate limits by using high-impact, low-bandwidth techniques.\n\nFinally, the speed at which the attack commences \u2013 sometimes referred to as the \"thundering herd\" effect \u2013 doesn't leave much time to react and counter the problem. A coordinated DDoS, leveraging botnets and other always-on attackers, can hit without any advance warning. If you don't have a tested plan to respond to DoS attacks, you're going to have to invent one on the fly while simultaneously reporting your status every 15 minutes to the CIO.\n\nHow to Combat this New Approach:\nDespite attempts of new tools to avoid automated blocking, there are usually key indicators which uniquely identify packets as belonging to the attack. Analysis by the University of Twente on the LOIC DDoS tool found the techniques to be surprisingly simple from a protocol perspective, featuring high repetition of a similar URL pattern, and absolutely no lower-layer obfuscation like IP spoofing. If you have a packet capture infrastructure in place, the attack packets will be easy to find, as they'll constitute the majority of your capture. With this in mind, you'll need to find a signature or behavior which is common to the attack traffic, but not on your normal traffic. In some cases your packet analyzer has visualization or an expert analysis tool to identify a useful characteristic for you. A very useful example of this kind of fingerprint analysis is the SpiderLabs analysis of LOIC, including packet dump and Snort rules.\n\nThe key here is to turn the attack's strength into its weakness. Highly automated attacks will be fairly homogenous, so an attack fingerprint can quickly be developed and deployed, and the attack impact halted. The strength of DDoS comes from central coordination of large numbers of already-deployed attack engines. While these engines have dynamic target settings, they have fixed methods of attack. Identifying and blocking those attack methods greatly reduces the attack impact. This is true even of tools which are designed to provide increased detection avoidance via mixed attack method and increased randomization. After the HOIC tool was released as a detection-resistant alternative to LOIC, SpiderLabs analysis of HOIC showed that it has certain hard-coded aspects which still allow for detection and blocking. Fixing those mistakes might be easy for the attack tool authors, but the difficulties of distribution of black-hat software make upgrade releases problematic. Anyone who has done PC support knows the pain of large-scale application version management. Imagine performing version upgrades without benefit of an official trusted source of the software.\n\nAs an additional step in combating DoS attacks, once you have a fingerprint identified, you can also use it to determine if any of the hosts in your own network are sending similar traffic, causing someone else the same pain you're feeling. If you have a network traffic recorder, use your packet analyzer dashboard to examine the historical traffic to and from that host. Even without a fingerprint, you can get started by looking at suspicious traffic. Command and Control of botnets has historically happened via IRC, so look for traffic to port 6667 and surrounding ports (e.g. 6660-6669). Any outbound traffic to a non-standard port is worth investigating to identify the C&C, report it per your CERT process, and block traffic from your network to prevent future botnet activity.\n\nIn the end, no security system on the market is foolproof, but as cyber crimes get more sophisticated, businesses must be able to recognize and constantly adapt to new security threats. In order to ensure that you are completely prepared in the event of a DoS attack, there must also be a security \"insurance policy\" in place\u2014often in the form of a network recorder. The ability to quickly suspend this new level of DoS attacks is tantamount to protecting your reputation, your data, and your business a whole. Hopefully this blog serves as a reminder that if you don't have a DoS mitigation plan already, now is a good time to create one before it's too late.What would the holidays be without the inevitable email phishing campaigns, cyber attacks, and data breaches? This year's recipients included Apple, Telstra, an Australia-based telecommunications and information services company, and Stratfor Global Intelligence, an Austin, TX-based security group, among others. And when it comes to responding to breaches, time is of the essence.\n\n\"'Every minute you take to figure this out, you could be losing more e-mails and more credit data,' Kevin Mandia of Mandiant recently said to the NY Times. The goal is to determine quickly the \"fingerprint\" of the intrusion and its scope: 'How did the guy break in? What did he take? When did he break in? And, how do I stop this?'\"\n\nIn fact, your cyber security solution needs to address these five key questions:\n\nWho was the intruder?\n\nHow did the intruder penetrate security?\n\nWhat damage has been done?\n\nDid anything get left behind?\n\nDid you capture sufficient information to effectively analyze and reproduce the attack?\n\nQuestion 5 is the gotcha for most solutions. While Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) raise an alarm, they fail to provide network engineers with the details they need to quickly locate and correct the source of an attack. Augmenting these systems with a network recorder enables post-event analysis that exposes the attacker, the method, and the damage.\n\nThe following video shows why you should employ data recorders in line with your IDS\/IPS systems.\n\nJoin us February 15, 2012 at 8:30AM PST, for a free live seminar, \"Cyber Security \u2013 IDS\/IPS is not Enough,\" to learn how with Network Forensics and Network Recording you can characterize not only the breach, but also assess the damage, ensure no further compromise, and comply with corporate and legal requirements for reporting."}

{"text":"PlaceRaider. The name sounds like a gamer tag someone would use on Xbox. It isn't a gamer tag, however. (Well it might be but not in the context of this article.) PlaceRaider is the name of a new malware developed by Robert Templeman from the US Naval Surface Warfare Center in conjunction with a few people from Indiana University. And damn is it scary. So scary, in fact, that it is being described as \"malware designed to steal your life\".\n\nCategorized in a new class as \"visual malware\", PlaceRaider infects smartphones in the form of a malicious app. Once installed, PlaceRaider runs in the background and continually secretly takes photos using the camera on smartphones. (PlaceRaider mutes phones so as to not make a shutter sound when photos are snapped.) These photos are then sent to a remote server which filters the photos to remove dark or blurry images (such as photos taken when a phone is in a pocket) and creates a 3D model out of the remaining ones. Since this 3D model is made from photos taken from a smartphone (i.e. photos of the target person's surroundings), the model potentially contains sensitive and personal information \u2014 such as credit card numbers, computer activity, etc. This information is stolen by analyzing the 3D model.\n\nCurrently PlaceRaider has been developed to work on Android[2] 2.3. However, seeing as the malware doesn't exploit any specific Android vulnerability but rather tricks users into installing the app, Templeman sees no issues with it being ported to other platforms such as iOS[3] or Windows Phone[4]:\n\nWe implemented on Android for practical reasons, but we expect such malware to generalize to other platforms such as iOS and Windows Phone.\n\nTempleman also mentions that while he and his team designed PlaceRaider to take photos, it is possible to do the same thing with videos.\n\nSince this was developed by a research arm of the US Navy, there isn't too much to worry about seeing PlaceRaider appear in-the-wild. While I'm sure the Navy will use this technology for warfare and intelligence gathering purposes, I highly doubt they would release it on the general public. However, if Templeman and friends can develop something like this, it isn't hard to imagine that someone else can, too \u2014 someone else that may release the malware in-the-wild for devious purposes.\n\nThis is yet another reason to be careful about what you install on your smartphone because, after all, it may be small but it is a full-blown computer."}

{"text":"Posted\nby\ntimothyon Thursday March 21, 2013 @05:26PM from the do-nations-have-the-right-to-kill? dept.\n\nNerval's Lobster writes \"Cyber-attacks are much in the news lately, thanks to some well-publicized hacks and rising concerns over malware. Many of these attacks are likely backed in some way by governments anxious to seize intellectual property, or simply probe other nations' IT infrastructure. But do nations actually have a right to fire off a bomb or a clip of ammunition at cyber-attackers, especially if a rival government is backing the latter as part of a larger hostile action? Should a military hacker, bored and exhausted from twelve-hour days of building malware, be regarded in the same way as a soldier with a rifle? Back in 2009, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (which also exists under the lengthy acronym NATO CCD COE) commissioned a panel of experts to produce a report on the legal underpinnings of cyber-warfare. NATO CCD COE isn't funded by NATO, and nor is it a part of that organization's command-and-control structure\u2014but those experts did issue a nonbinding report (known as \"The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\") exploring the ramifications of cyber-attacks, and what targeted nations can do in response. It's an interesting read, and the experts do suggest that, under circumstances, a nation under cyber-attack can respond to the cyber-attackers with \"kinetic force,\" so long as that force is proportional. Do you agree?\"\n\nI think the old saying \"If you play with fire, you might get burnt...\" applies here. Do I think it is right, yes and no at the same time. Just because the hacker is sitting in an office typing on a keyboard doesn't mean he\/she isn't inflicting real world harm on others in another part of the world. At the same time, I think it would likely be a huge escalation to go from something being hacked to dropping a bomb - but that's not to say that dumb things don't happen - especially when politicians are involved.\n\nI think anyone who is doing harm to another country, whether it is with a rifle and boots, or with a keyboard and an internet connection is fair game.\n\nThe biggest threats to our freedom, safety, and economic well being come from our own governments, not foreign ones. When we start using proportional force against internal threats, we can start talking about what proportional force against external threats is.\n\nIOW, I'm a lot more scared of Goldman Sachs than I am scared of China.\n\nShould a factory worker manufacturing weapons and munitions be targeted? In war historically they have been. I think the main problem now is that we don't have distinct times of war and peace, we have a messy in-between all the time.\n\nIt makes a huge difference whether somebody is armed or using a computer. So, what's next, we bomb Chinese factories because their goods harm Americans? Because that's about as rational as what you're suggesting.\n\nTaking human life needs to be done thoughtfully, doing it because you can is something that states are supposed to aspire not to do. And really, they shouldn't be taking life over this sort of thing.\n\nIt does need tio be considered carefully, but a cyberwarfare hacker and facility are every bit as much a legitimate target of war as a central headquarters, signals intelligence installation or codebreakers. However, if a shooting war hasn't (yet) broken out, it is also just as much an escalation as bombing any other military target would be.\n\nCyber attacks falls under espionage. Nations have been killing spies for thousands of years. There is always a risk when killings spys of killing a civilion. They generally don't use bombs to do it though.\n\nthey don't have the right to just kill random dudes around the world without a trial. where the fuck did you get that idea? obama? bush?\n\nmaybe, maybe if they first define that they're in a war with the said enemy country and then start bombing them or invade them and kill the said hacker in battle(just shooting them in cold blood and not taking them as POW would still not be right).\n\neven then it's debatable if they have the right for it. doesn't mean that some countries wouldn't do shit like that without declaring war though. it just doesn't make it right.\n\nwhere the fuck did you guys learn your ethics for war? from fucking terrorists? what's next, saying it's ok to use mustard gas on suspected hooligans since shop keepers have a right to defend their porch? gunning down someone who stole your wifi is ok?\n\nI've been saying that war is too civil, too precise, and not horrific enough. War has become tolerable with attacks that kill exactly who you want with little collateral damage (usually). If war was more horrible people would do more to prevent it. Reminds me of the Star Trek episode \"A Taste of Armageddon\" which is a great episode (\n\nBuildings suspected to harboring haxors should be napalmed (just kidding...we should counter-hack them).\n\nAnd shouldn't drone pilots from and within the USA be just as much a target for targeted killing by the \"other side\" even while they are located in the USA geographical boundaries? So if the cyberwarfare hacker is still a legitimate target while not actively engaged in the \"war activity\", couldn't a USA drone pilot be legitimately targeted while walking into a grocery store to buy groceries for her\/his family and herself\/himself? There's a lot to think about when we decide to expand the boundaries of what we are allowed to do while still claiming \"nya-nya-nya, you can't do that to us while we can do that to you\", mostly because of the assymetry of our tactical abilities. . Overreaching on moral boundaries because of our tactical abilities could be our downfall when we no longer have the tactical advantage. We no longer have the moral advantage (considering the things that have already been done in \"our\" name, since it is our USA and our armed forces and our \"special forces\" that have carried out extra-ordinary rendition, torture in Abu Ghraim, extra-judicial kidnappings and extra-judicial extra-warfare executions\/assassinations) but it makes to sense to keep digging ourselves deeper when we could actually be a beacon of sensibility to the world. Oh, wait, that's not really our goal, is it, regardless of whether the Republicans or Democrats are leading in the Executive or in the Legislative branches of our government.\n\nA draft is not going to push the burden of war on to the wealthy. Just like when there was a draft before, the wealthy will just fit in the \"exceptions\" category. Whether that is because they can afford college, or they can have one of their cronies arrange for their kid to get a states side posting.\n\nYou are morally opposed to bombing, that's cool, I can respect that seriously.\n\nHowever if we bomb a janitor trying to feed his family and taking the only job he can find at a bullet manufacturing plant and kill him, then what makes him so diametrically more involved in war than someone writing software to guide missiles, or someone who writes software to melt down an enemy nuclear rector or worse.\n\nRules of war are a zany thing, especially since one side (the underdogs) usually ignores them completely and figures they probably won't be alive to see the aftermath of that decision, or they will be a totalitarian regime, and won't have to face the music.\n\nHow much water is behind the hoover dam which software controls? How much mass is in a tomahawk missile that runs on software? How much mass; is in a bunker buster, that is guided by GPS which is also run on military software?\n\nWithout software no modern military would be able to mount a campaign.\n\nI know man, I don't want to get killed either, but just saying the guy that holds a joystick flying a drone bombing people isn't really that much better than someone shooting bullets other than he has air conditioning and a chair.\n\nAre you suggesting this as a serious possibility, or trying to illustrate (via ludicrousness) how unworkable such tactics would be unless we convert the Internet into something *totally* different to what it is today?\n\nIf the former, I'd like to point out that such tactics would be unworkable unless we converted the Internet into something totally different to what it is today.:-)\n\nIn all seriousness, there's no way that you'll *ever* be able to isolate any country on the Internet today from any other country- no matter how hard you try. Unless you totally isolate that country from *every* other one, and seal all holes, it'll still be possible to get through by indirect means.\n\n\"Secure Club\"? Works well, provided there are absolutely *no* holes whatsoever in the outside of this massive infrastructure, and everyone is happy to go along with your plans exactly as you want them. Which is to say, it's not going to work in reality.\n\nIn fact, it's clear that even if the US decided it wanted to cut itself off entirely from *every* other country- while retaining approximately the same level of infrastructure within the US- it would be ludicrously difficult and unlikely to work.\n\nJust start assassinating enemy leaders as the basic response to attacks and there will be a lot more peace in the world. Imagine if every time N Korea created an incident, their leader got shot\/bombed. Or if the UK killed off the leadership of Argentina when the Falklands were invaded.\n\nProportional response is a good thing. But why direct it at cannon fodder and not at the people in charge? If you come under attack by state sponsored hackers, then kill off their heads of state. You'll get a much more satisfactory result with fewer casualties.\n\nThat's not a fair accusation because you are examining those actions through the lens of modern warfare where precision munitions are a reliable and effective tool.

{"text":"The internet can be a confusing place and that provides opportunity for criminals and criminal behaviour. High profile cases of criminal behaviour tend to be those that involve large sums of money or threaten national security. There are however dangers for everyday users of the internet that are often lower down the priority agenda for regulators, legislators and the police.\n\nThe Government has been working to address the issue of cyber crime and published its Cyber Security Strategy at the end of last year, while we were taking evidence on this inquiry. We welcome the broad sweep of the strategy but it remains, in essence, focussed at too high a level to address the key concerns of everyday internet users.\n\nThe overwhelming message from those who gave evidence to us was that there is a need for computer users to be better informed. Those using the internet need to be aware of the potential risk and have a trusted source of authoritative advice and up to date information about malware and internet scams. Too often advice and information for the internet are too technical or difficult for most computer users to properly understand and effectively act upon. There is also the problem that there are so many messages from a variety of sources that it is easy to become overwhelmed and difficult to know who to trust....\n\nOne key element that the Government can address is that of providing a way for consumers to recognise those computer programmes that enhance rather than undermine online security. We have recommended that the Government seek to develop a kite mark, or similar solution, that software publishers can be awarded if they prove their product meets security standards. However, we recognise such schemes can militate against smaller companies and ask the Government to investigate how it might remove some of the financial disincentives for smaller companies wanting to promote the security of their products"}
{"text":"MCPc Blog\n\nIn 2006, Melanie Rieback, a researcher at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands wrote an article entitled \"Is Your Cat Infected with a Computer Virus?\" The article noted the increasing adoption of implanted RFID tags for tracking pets and questioned whether those tags were susceptible to computer viruses.\n\nThe larger implication of the article was that if implantable devices could be contaminated, a risk was created for humans as well as animals.\n\nRFID Tags Explained\n\nRFID tags are tiny microchips combined in a package with an antenna. The tags have the ability to send out signals to a wireless network, which can be used to determine the tag's location or perform more sophisticated applications such as transferring records.\n\nMajor Security Concerns\n\nDr. Rieback posited the question of whether, during a transfer of information, a virus could be introduced on the tag; and, if such a virus was introduced, could it then be transferred to other parts of a network?\n\nAt the time the article was published, the IT security community dismissed the possibility. The consensus was that because of the read-only capability of most RFID devices, viruses would have no way to replicate.\n\nHowever, RFID technology capabilities have grown dramatically in the last four years. Read\/write devices are now common. Unlike read-only tags \u2014 which only contain the information put on them when they were manufactured \u2014 read\/write tags can be overwritten. This means that information can be sent to, and recovered from, these tags. In short, the early argument against Dr. Reiback's theory is now defunct.\n\nDr. Gasson programmed an RFID chip to open doors and to activate his cell phone. He then implanted this chip into his arm. The result: using the chip, he could activate door-entry systems and wake his cell phone just by walking within range.\n\nFor the next part of his experiment, Dr. Gasson sent a virus to the tag. When the tag was used to enter his lab, its virus was passed on to the network that controlled the door-entry system. From there, it was passed to the tags of Dr. Gasson's colleagues who used the entry network. This proved, according to Gasson, that the human body could be the carrier of contamination that could infect a computer network.\n\nIT Security Community Reaction\n\nThe IT security community largely condemned Dr. Gasson's methodology and his conclusions. The human-computer virus connection, they said, was an alarmist grab for personal publicity.\n\nIn his defense, Gasson told the Sydney Morning Herald he was \"exploring from a multi-disciplinary perspective the potential and risks of implanted devices,\" and that the research \"used vulnerability in the technology to allow an engineered computer virus to propagate via an implant.\"\n\nThis intentional attempt to spread a virus to a device inside the human body invites the question of whether a virus could maliciously be spread to implanted medical devices.\n\nMany pacemakers, for example, wirelessly communicate with computers in a doctor's office. This allows the doctor to easily collect information and keep track of what's going on with his or her patients. Could a life-threatening virus use this connection to spread to these devices?\n\nMedical Device Viruses at the VA\n\nA recent article in InformationWeek reported that the Department of Veterans Affairs has taken 122 medical devices offline in the last fourteen months because of malware contamination. Diverse equipment \u2014 including MRIs, CT scanners, EKG machines and audiology diagnostic machines \u2014 were included. The total represents a small percentage of the VA's 50,000 medical devices, but the threat is seen as significant.\n\n\"The major challenge with securing medical devices is that, because their operation must be certified, the application of operating system patches and malware protection updates is tightly restricted,\" said Roger Baker, assistant secretary for information and technology at the Department of Veterans Affairs. \"This inherent vulnerability can increase the potential for cyber attacks on the VA trusted network by creating risk to patient safety.\"\n\nIn the InformationWeek article, Baker expressed his concern: \"These infections have the potential to greatly affect the world-class patient care that is expected by our customers. In addition to compromising data and the system, these incidents are also extremely costly to the VA in terms of time and money spent cleansing infected medical devices.\"\n\nThe VA, like many healthcare organizations, has a strict policy on the application of operating system patches, malware protection updates and the re-certification of compromised equipment. Therefore, it typically takes several months before a medical device infected with a virus can be cleared for reuse.\n\nImplications to IT Professionals\n\nSo, could your cat get a computer virus? Probably not.\n\nDr. Gasson did not, in the end, have a computer virus. He was merely carrying a device that had a virus. The fact that the device was embedded under his skin is actually immaterial, as he could have achieved the same effect by carrying an infected smartphone.\n\nIt's more important to focus on the device: there was nothing in the tag to keep it from acquiring and spreading malware. Though in most cases, viruses can't get past an individual device due to firewall protection, a device itself that isn't secured poses a potential risk.\n\nFor example, the inability of a pacemaker to associate with a hospital network would be of small consolation if that pacemaker resided in your chest and was being controlled by someone with malicious intent. It is important that those responsible for security in healthcare organizations be aware of these potential access points for attacks from unexpected sources, and provide security for every intelligent device.\n\nBill Cannon is Vice President of Business Development at MCPc, and an IT industry veteran with expertise in networking and telecommunications technology.

{"text":"Beware the ransomware scam\n\nScam alert! Many Canadians are falling for a new costly Internet scam. Find out more -- and how to protect your computer.\n\nCanadians around the country have been reporting being locked out of their computers at a high rate lately, says the Canadian Anti Fraud Centre and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Technological Crime Branch.\n\nIt primarily happens after users have received a pop-up message saying their computer has been associated with illegal music downloading or child pornography.\n\nThe warning messages look official and claim to come from Canadian government agencies like the RCMP, and advise the user to pay $100 via Ukash \u2013 a payment service provider \u2013 in order to have their computer unlocked.\n\nThese messages, known as ransomware, are scams created with the intent of scaring the user into responding quickly and sending the money.\n\nThe Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre advises that if you receive one of these messages, you need to be aware of the following points:\n\n1) The ransomware is an attempt to defraud you.\n\n2) Sending money will not fix your computer \u2013 it will remain locked. DO NOT SEND MONEY.\n\n3) Neither the RCMP nor any other Canadian government agency would hijack computers in order to obtain money. The ransomware presence is hard evidence that your computer has been infected by malicious software (malware) that must be dealt with.\n\n4) The recommended way to re-gain access to your computer is to seek the help of a computer technician who can remove the malware.\n\n5) To protect against cyber attacks, you must regularly update your software. You should have up-to-date anti-virus, spyware and firewall protection.\n\nCyber crime has seen an increase lately in Canada, with the country now being considered the main center for this kind of activity.\n\nThe website CMIT Solutions offers helpful advice when dealing with this kind of malware. They note that it's important to be aware of scareware designed to trick you into thinking you've done something wrong. A basic rule of thumb: anytime money is part of the equation you should be suspicious and contact your computer tech.\n\nExperts say malware falls into two different categories: malice and greed.\n\nRansomware falls squarely into the greed category and, unlike the malice types, these perpetrators are in it for the cash potential rather than an interest in hurting people.\n\nThis scam is a form of data hijacking, as it doesn't destroy your data like a virus but instead locks you out of it and threatens you with a ransom fee. Usually it will give you just a few hours to pay the fee before it claims to delete all your data.\n\nIf you come across this scam, do not try to fix it yourself as this is known to cause even more problems with your computer. Instead contact your computer guy and get him to remove the malware as soon as possible.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself?

{"text":"George \"Geohot\" Hotz, the hacker who publicly released details on an exploit that circumvents PS3 security protections and enables system owners to run unauthorized code, has stated that he is not involved in the recent compromise of Sony's PlayStation Network.\n\nEarlier in the week, Sony revealed that an illegal intrusion into its network had compromised its database of user account information.\n\nIn a blog post, Hotz noted that he has nothing to do with the intrusions, and he \"would prefer to not have the FBI knocking on my door.\" Hotz said he was \"one of the good guys... I used to play games online on PC, I hated cheaters then and I hate them now.\"\n\nHe also launched an attack on Sony executives, saying, \"Let's not fault the Sony engineers for this, the same way I do not fault the engineers who designed the BMG rootkit.\"\n\n\"The fault lies with the executives who declared a war on hackers, laughed at the idea of people penetrating the fortress that once was Sony, whined incessantly about piracy, and kept hiring more lawyers when they really needed to hire good security experts.\"\n\nAt the start of the month, the hack group Anonymous announced its intention to attack Sony websites in retaliation for the company's legal actions against PlayStation 3 hackers, as a result of Sony's lawsuits with Hotz and hacker Alexander \"Graf_Chokolo\" Egorenkov.\n\nThe group noted, \"In light of this assault on both rights and free expression, Anonymous, the notoriously handsome rulers of the internet, would like to inform you that you have only been 'renting' your web domains. Having trodden upon Anonymous' rights, you must now be trodden on.\"\n\nHowever, in light of the recent intrusion, the hacker collective denied any involvement with the current outage. Sony's latest updates have not named Anonymous specifically as the group behind the attacks on PlayStation Network.\n\nWhen people will understand they have no right over companies' intellectual properties, no matter how much they disagree with those companies' policies?\n\nThis is all GeoHot's fault. Don't try to shift the blame to someone that actually produces something millions of people were willing to pay for\/use. People like GeoHot are the real looters, liars and moochers in this whole thing. I wish the press and that moronic US senator would realize that for once and for all.\n\n\"Oh when will people realize big business has them totally #$%^@# and they should just shut up like good little slaves and deal with it\".\n\nYour mindset destroys nations. You're already quicker to blame a single fellow citizen for one of the biggest security flubs in history then a corporation with one of the most extensive track records of not giving a crap about it's customers around.\n\nAnd despite not having any real clues as to the perpetrators, you've declared him guilty of all related matters. It could have been the Russian mob for all we know, and have no connection to him whatsoever. That's not even \"guilty until proven innocent\", that's \"just guilty because I don't like you\".\n\nNo, it's YOUR mindset that destroy nations by shifting the blame from the perpretator to the victim.\n\nThere's no dancing around the issue. Someone hacked Sony. Someone stole the information. If this isn't countered no company has any incentive to produce and sell services.\n\nYou're not a slave to companies unless you want to. No one pointed a gun and forced millions of people to use PSN. No one pointed a gun and prevented anyone from leaving the PS3 and PSN behind once features such as OtherOS were removed. Even if you see it as a stripped service or product, it doesn't give you the right to steal from them. End of story. Deal with it.\n\nYou completely ignore the fact that consumers have rights and Sony violated them, but your attitude makes it quite plain that you think IP law trumps consumer rights. David Campbell is correct, your line of thinking is dangerous to the basic freedoms of everyone and you're passing out blame without the slightest amount of evidence to support it. You can't just blame GeoHot for every malady that ails Sony from now on because you don't like what he did.\n\nTrue, 77 million users had enough confidence in SONY's security measures. It looks like this confidence had no base. SONY didn't prevent the data, users handed them over, thinking it was secure, from being stolen. There's no dancing around THAT issue.\n\nThere was a security breach, other companies obviously managed to avoid so far. I didn't heard, that Microsoft's or Amazon's servers have been hacked and sensitive data of customers was stolen, that's a first for SONY.\n\nAnd besides, it's completely unaccaptable to wait a whole week, before informing the people, that it is possible, that their credit card informations are stolen.\n\nI believe XBox live was hacked back in March 2007, and if you search Amazon and Hacked...there are quite a few articles and stories that come out about personal information\/accounts being hacked over a stretch of time.\n\nNo companies are safe from this..and are probably being attacked everyday...I would like to see how many of the 77 Million will have issues after this initial hit blows over.\n\nI didn't said, these networks couldn't be hacked (even if the rumours of XBox Live being hacked have never been proven), I said, that the theft of sensitive information during a hack was a first for SONY. Hacked accounts are in 99.9% users fault.\n\nWell that would be fine and dandy as long as Sony was willing to refund me my purchase price of my PS3 when they removed the Other OS.\n\n\"Stopping\" being a customer and switching to Xbox or PC only for my entertainment needs means I am at a loss of my current purchases.\n\nContinuing to use their system and receiving updates means I am out a loss of a feature that came with my system.\n\nNot updating the system to retain the Other OS functionality removes the ability to play online, and games that require a certain firmware level.\n\nSo no matter which way you slice it, Sony \"cost\" the customer something. People purchased the console and were customers who played by Sony's rules, but then they changed the rules after the fact. That is the issue at hand.\n\nNow, I am not complaining that they \"owe\" anybody anything but they can't say anybody owes them accepting their changes and not hack their system (just like jailbreaking an iPhone is NOT illegal). Of course I don't support any piracy or hacking their network either, but there is more to the picture than Sony is acknowledging.\n\nHackers said about two months ago that PSN stored customers data into plain text or XML files. I agree with GeoHot: Sony should have hired security experts, not waste time with a lawsuit that ended up making them look bad and solved nothing. The PS3 was born with PS2 backwards compatibility and OtherOS capabilities: both are gone now, they screwed their paying customers and now they are being punished for it.\n\nYou can't possibly put the blame on GeoHot. If PSN is something that millions of people use and pay for then Sony should be smart enough to build a secure environment. Data theft, especially personal data of the people that use your service is never under any circumstances acceptable.\n\nSony should be dragged through the streets for this. And with the way they have handled the \"hackers\" they have brought this upon themselves.\n\nSony has a responsibility. But let me put it like this. If you leave your possessions unguarded on the street you shouldn't be surprised if they're taken away. But it's still robbery and it's the government's duty to investigate it and punish the robbers.\n\nYou have a point but this isn't me putting my information on the internet just because. If thats the case, then I am at fault. But if I give my information to a third party with the notion that information will remain secure, and am compromised then it is the fault of the third party.\n\nYour example would be more relevant if it was...If I give my money to a bank with the notion that it is secure there, and the bank puts my money out on the curb in a plastic bag...I AM NOT at fault, the bank is.\n\nI would be at fault if the bank had a really bad reputation, which Sony now has and will have to do a lot to repair that.\n\nYou're ignoring the fact that it was Sony who left the door unlocked, not the consumer. When you accept and store data from your customers, you have a huge responsibility to keep it in a safe place. Sony failed at this, and they are paying a high price for it.\n\nYour bank example is actually better than mine indeed. But keeping this analogy, the point I'm making is that it seems everyone is pointing at the bank while the robbers are running away and spending the money, so to speak.\n\nAlso, I don't agree it is your 'fault' if the bank has 'a bad reputation'. It isn't a matter of fault but of recklessness. Both are quite different. No matter how bad the reputation the bank had, it's still the law's and the governmnent's concern to see to it that your money is returned (if possible) to the bank and then to you. The bank should also be investigated, of course, and maybe even be fined and punished due to breach of banking regulations or whatever - but just because it's the bigger fish it doesn't mean the case is not about someone stealing what isn't his or hers.\n\nAnd GeoHot is the guy who pointed at the plastic bag and said 'look, the bank left all this money on the curb.' He's got way more responsability in this than the customer unaware of the bank's reputation.\n\nPlease, keep attempting to blame this all on Hotz. I'm laughing so hard right now.\n\n\"And GeoHot is the guy who pointed at the plastic bag and said 'look, the bank left all this money on the curb.' \"\n\nDubious as the analogy is, lets use it for lulz. How was Hotz saying this? He said it loud and in the open and the 'bank employees' response was \"shut up man! you can't speak about our practices\" as opposed to, you know focusing on picking the bag up off the street.\n\n@Tom - Indeed, you are right. But if someone offers to keep your stuff in their house, they're responsible if it gets stolen. Not entirely responsible, but responsible.\n\nFabio likens creating a PSN account and purchasing content to setting it out on the street for anyone to take, and that is a view that is wrong, because it ignores the important responsibility Sony has to protect you and your data.\n\nIf i give my stuff to s friend under the understanding that he'd take care of it and then he leaves it on the middle of the street unguarded you bet your ass that i'd be blaming him...\n\nAlso, the only reason why i wouldn't be critical of a woman that i had warned not to walk in Rape Alley dressed like a hooker that was raped is because i'd feel sorry for her as a person with feelings (well that and the fact that some idiots would interpret that as saying rape is ok instead of me questioning her disregard for clear warnings)... Sony, as a corporation, only has a bottom line.\n\nI agree with Alessandro. While I don't support stealing information or hacking in general, Sony has really had it coming for a long time. And they really should have spent less time posturing and more time reviewing standard security practices. Now they have been made fools of publicly, and angered many of their customers. The confidence in them will be the hardest thing to recover.\n\nWhat you both fail to understand is that since Sony is already paying for their recklessness, the point is that there's a crime to be solved and it wasn't commited by Sony - to the contrary, it is the victim of the crime.\n\nAt the end of the day, what you or anyone else thinks of them doesn't matter. What matters is the crime to be solved and prevented.\n\nMost probably that happens because the victim #onoesitsacorporationandcorporationsareEVIL!\n\nI DO simpathyze with the idea that we shouldn't simply watch companies do everything they want and fail to respond. But the key is HOW we respond. Once we resort to crimes such as theft (and MASSIVE theft in this case), we're doing worse than most things companies do - and the fact that we're \"the little guys\" isn't an excuse.\n\nWhy are you blaming consumers for this? The people who perpetrated this crime are not representatives for everyone using PSN or consumers at large, nor have they released any information about why they did what they did. You're applying your own rationale to their actions, and you're making too many assumptions about what happened here.\n\nyoure very right timothy. even non-gamers and people that dont own sony products get that they deserved this. nothing more to say about that. motorstorm will blast onto our screens in 1080p on launch day, right? buhahaha.\n\nActually, Sony IS RESPONSIBLE. They guaranteed that our data would be secure. As soon as our personal information is transmitted to their servers, they have a legal responsibility to protect it, especially if it's sensitive.\n\nSony clearly did not take adequate measures to protect our data.\n\nWho cares about the hackers? Sure, go and prosecute them. That's fine. But, realize that in order for an intrusion to happen, there has to be an exploitable hole within a security network first, one that is there for a reason -- not enough oversight, incorrect testing, lack of experienced developers, etc.\n\nComparing this to rape, car theft, etc. is stupid. Stop trying to apply analogies. This is a well known technological phenomenon that has occurred outside of games for decades.\n\nIf you really want an analogy, it goes this way:\n\nIf you leave your credit card on the street, someone can find it. Will they use it for good or evil? Who knows.\n\nIf you put your credit card in your wallet, you're less inclined to have it stolen. Sure, you might lose it somewhere, or someone might pick your pocket; but, it's a bit more protected.\n\nIf you place your credit card in a safe and only use it when you absolutely need to, well, it's far less likely to be stolen.\n\nIf you only digitally utilize your credit card with expiring temporary numbers that are \"correct fit\" for each transaction, you can never have your card stolen, since it doesn't physically exist. That's pretty damn protected.\n\nI don't think anyone is saying that Sony has no responsibility at all.\n\nThe point is that Sony's security failures still don't give anyone the right to steal from them, and this side of the case should be investigated and dealt with too. End of story.\n\nIf you don't care about the hackers, it's your problem. I do. I don't want services that I find to be useful to compromise usability because some people think they have a right to things that are not theirs just because they don't like the service or it isn't foolproof. I'm not doing anything wrong. Sony may have been reckless with the data but it didn't stole anything from me or forced me to use their services. The only side in this that robbed anything from anyone were the hackers. Therefore they're the top priority in any society that cares about protecting people's properties. Dance around this however you want.\n\nThe point in publishing his remarks is that they are included in his denial of involvement with the attacks. Just as there was a point in publishing anonymous' denial of involvement. Just as there was a point in publishing Sony's speculations on what was and wasn't taken and when services will be up. It's information related to the central event \"PSN Hack\". This is how reporting\/blogging works.\n\nIf there is evidence that Sony was negligent in the way they secured or stored this information then I think it's totally fair to blame them for their negligence. I think people are jumping to conclusions here since there doesn't seem to be any evidence that that's actually the case, but maybe in the future we'll find out that it was.\n\nBut the idea that Sony *deserved* for this to happen is petty and childish, and ignores the fact that the primary victims here are Sony's *customers*, the people that Sony's loudest critics claim they're trying to protect.\n\nThe fact that this data was stolen at all and the downtime that ensued is proof enough that Sony was negligent.\n\nDid they deserve it? Of course not and Sony's customers certainly didn't deserve it. Keep in mind, that a hacker, once inside the system, could take the data and a) slink away quietly or b) destroy everything on the way out. What kind of a hacker(s) do you think we are dealing with?\n\nThis isn't a house. This isn't Chernobyl. This isn't friggin' Disney Land.\n\nThis is a data facility or collection of data facilities exposed to one of the most wild and hostile environments human-kind has created: the internet. Private, extremely sensitive data was housed on these machines.\n\nThat is the reality of it.\n\nThe additional reality is that a hacker or collection of hackers managed to bypass this \"secure center\" and the various systems Sony had engineered and retrieve critical information.\n\nThat is the reality of it. No analogies needed. Draw your conclusions from there.\n\nSony doesn't want to be dragged over the nails in court by doing an \"internal\" investigation that may or may not destroy evidence and\/or produce whatever results best help their stock price. This makes them appear much more confident in their security, by saying \"We'll let another, independent company assess the incident and our security\" because they believe it will show they had adequate security and the hackers couldn't have been stopped by reasonable industry standard measures alone.\n\nOf course, there's still a conflict of interest when a company pays another to \"review\" its security, just like when a company pays a credit rating firm to \"rate\" their credit.\n\nCrime is not a condition of nature - as you imply it is. An act of crime isn't like the weather or something - like a snowstorm - which is what you seem to be depicting it as. It is a choice made by people.\n\nTo look at it through those engineers eyes and utterly miss the moral culpability dimension is very very scary.\n\nThat's not at all what he said. He said there were security issues, that Sony had been made aware there were security issues, and that Sony should have spent money on security experts instead of lawyers. That's it, man.\n\nBasically Sony's acting like a company who is trying to protect their products.\n\nWhat anyone does in their personal time is fine as long as you don't distribute information which could make it easier for other people to break the system. Because of the attention Geohot has, the way Sony dealt with this case seems heavy handed (it may have, it may not have been but who am I to judge).\n\nBecause of the way the case has been handled, hackers like the ones in anonymous feel that there is a large injustice as one of their own has been treated thus. During the fuss over hacking the network, other hackers now know the network can be broken down(whether the protection was massive steel gate but someone found a small leak, or whether as some say the door was open doesn't matter as all hackers know that ANY system can be hacked with enough resources).\n\nEither way these hackers stole the PSN's information which was not all encrypted\/hashed.\n\nSo Sony is responsible for the delay (maybe they thought it was a bug but either way) which made them look like they were not organised to deal with such breaches in security. This caused lots of anger among the customers, further anger was created by not being transparent about the problem.\n\nAt the end of the day, all we know is some hackers stole this data which is due to all the hacking activity around the system. Sony has been a target of these groups as they seemed to make Geohot a scapegoat, but if they did all this within the confines of the law, then it is the laws fault for being so heavy handed.\n\nIf Sony were to allow people to keep hacking the system without fear of being prosecuted, people would lose faith in the security of the system, and all sorts of hackers would take pleasure in taking people's details.\n\nAlternatively if Sony allows hackers to install games developed to be sold on the system without any monetary costs, then people who read this magazine and all people in gaming would decide there is no reason to develop for this system if it is not possible to make money(or god forbid \"break even\").\n\nThe pirates reasoning for stealing games is because the demo does not give them enough of taste of the game, they want to try half the pie not just one spoon to make up their mind. This mentality would drive many games companies to ruin as there have been some reports which show that many players often do not finish the game.\n\nThe other excuse for stealing games is because the cost of games are so high, the problem is many of these pirates believe that all games cost nothing to produce. Even with an existing library of content and game engines, people who need to make a living are needed to put them together, often these libraries and game engines cost money often enough to put them into debt, so future games will have to make use of these resources until the company goes into the next cycle. Gamers expect new content and new libraries with each new iteration, due to cost this just may not be possible without making the game cost more. This may not be the best way to make games but this is the way some games are made, as with any industry the money and time are in limited supply.\n\nThere is always the option of just waiting for the game to get cheaper, prices of games are too volatile, and consumers expect the price of games to be high on release. So they have become used to the price dropping significantly.\n\nEven really cheap games like \"World of Goo\" which was released without drm was widely pirated. Some pirates believe all games should be free, as they do not produce a physical product but a virtual product that we could have imagined in a dream (same goes for films). This unfortunately is the mentality of the pirates who believes there is no value in non-physical products. They believe the time and energy spent products producing data has no intrinsic value only the physical product which they cannot procure without over the net (for now, until the 3D printer).\n\nPirates in unsupported countries often cite that they cannot play the game in their own country, due to DRM or server lag, etc. This maybe the only reason where I would agree with these pirates, software being held down by DRM\/network requirements often halt the gaming culture being spread to these other countries who desire to play the games. This is an unfortunate problem, and I can see that some companies just cannot support so many countries, games themselves if left with weaker DRM will be hacked and distributed more quicker, so larger companies are loath to produce such a product.\n\nPirates of course use the excuse of insufficient resouces taken up by drm, this is a problem that occurs all the time, how can drm work if it works part of the time. And it has been proven that drm-less software get more pirated than software which is drm regardless of the price.\n\nSome developers are happy that their product has been pirated as it gives them more status and publicity. There are some pirates who have a threshold of their value of a product who will buy it afterwards if they believe the value is of such greatness, these pirates at least contribute something, but usually only to the large games companies who make higher quality games, thus causing the game studios of the rich, getting richer and the poor ones getting poorer. Of course we feel dissatisfied when we paid money for a game which isn't very fun, but would you expect a refund for a well cooked but lack-luster meal that has been half eaten at a reasonable price? some of us i'm sure would have the courage and rudeness to do such a thing, but had we done it we'd feel guilty.\n\nThere is so much content on the internet about every game these days from video, demos, reviews faqs, forums that if you do your homework right you won't get burnt but that's the same with anything people buy, if they fear of spending money on a new product which may be faulty(looking at you apple), then don't buy it straight away, i'm sure there's many other games that could be played in the mean time.\n\nGod, i've gone off on one of my long rants again, hope I deterred you from pirating so much or going against the majority of pirates and hackers they spawn. If not, then you can keep your own counsel or tell me here\n\nI only pirate games I've already owned, such as Age Of Empires II. Bought it, lost the disc I've already told my player base that if for some reason my game cannot be played on the next gen consoles, I'll make it free.\n\n@ Fabio Macedo thank you for fighting the good fight and having the patience to\n\ndeal with the so much of the BS people are saying on this thread.\n\nBeing a student developer we have this conversation all the time at the Guildhall (SMU) and I've never met a professor or guest speaker who was or is the industry that thinks Piracy or IP theft is correct or just. ed(this is anecdotal but they are thoughts of industry vets)\n\nBottom line if you don't agree with Sony Business strategy don't buy Sony products. Why is it correct to attack Sony info structure that ruins consumer enjoyment and takes dollars away from developers.\n\nPeople think Piracy helps by Punishing publishers but ultimately dev's feel it the worst because their the entity that is unstable the most unstable Activsion, EA, MS, Sony there gonna be alright.\n\nYou can not blame the consumer. Because: what happens when I review the security system for the day care center and the day care center doesn't actually have security cameras but has plastic cameras instead? I am left with the idea that they actually have security when in fact they don't. Yes, the hackers should be sued by sony. Yes, Sony should be sued on multiple levels by their customers for not securing their information in the way they say they are.\n\nAccording to Sony's online privacy statement:\n\n\"Personal information is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible to authorized employees. In addition, Sony Online Services use industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number.\"\n\nThis was not the case. Sony stored personal information in a format that was not encrypted and it was hackable.\n\nMy own analogy:\n\nSony was foolish for taunting the hacker community (Don't poke a sleeping tiger)\n\nHotz was foolish for pointing it out (Don't put on a sausage necklace when someone is poking a tiger).\n\nThe Hackers are foolish since they will eventually get caught for doing stupid things (As a tiger, you should know that the man with a stick has a bunch of men behind him with large weapons.)\n\nTo everyone claiming that Sony, if it is the victim of a crime, shouldn't be protected because it's so big and rich I say this...\n\nIf you have a law you must enforce it in all cases. Rich or poor, whether you like it or not.\n\nIf you decide you'll only enforce it when \"you feel like it\", that is a slippery slope. If we can't steal, except in the case of big multinational companies, then soon someone will steal from a smaller company. Then a smaller one. Finally they will be stealing from individuals.\n\nBecause the precedent has been set.\n\nThe rape comment is really just a way of saying that Hotz is blaming the victim. Like a thug who says, \"If they didn't want me to steal their car, they shouldn't have left it unlocked\", thus totally evading their own responsibility in committing a crime.\n\nHotz doesn't deserve to be directly blamed for it either unless there is some evidence to prove he is.\n\nAnonymous hackers have pulled off a crime and hopefully they will be brought to the surface to face judgment whether or not they used Geohotz written techniques.\n\nSony is not a bank. Sony should not have stored credit card information if it could not properly secure it like the majority of banks can. If there is evidence of damage that can harm the consumer now or in the future you can expect Sony to be sued.\n\nHacker(s) some are thieves or employed by seedy people. Some are hobbyist and do it to see what they can achieve. Hacker(s) can be and are employed by many security firms to prevent such events as the current one that happened to Sony.\n\nThe problem is how the story has played out...\n\nIf Sony removed \"other OS\" because it foresaw an event happening just like this then they knew it was coming. The suit Sony brought upon Geohotz might just suggest that they saw this coming and tried to find a person to blame. Instead of issuing a consumer alert that this could happen they went for the suit. Neither the suit nor the security panned out in the end.\n\nI'm a Sony PS3 consumer. My information may have been compromised. Two institutions are at fault here. One that has hacker(s) that can pull this sort of thing off, and the other that foresaw the security threat and did not warn consumers before hand to remove sensitive information. Both should be held accountable to the full extent of the law.\n\nOnce again this is BIG and to try to make it something other than that is to be blind. This is going to change how online business is done between business and consumers. Do not try to place meaningless analogies around the situation to make a counterproductive point. Take what you see and piece it together to get the picture of what is happening. This is an ordinary crime that may have extraordinary measures.\n\nI'm not trying to insult those that did in this post, it's just always strange comparing something to something completely random.\n\nIf I Stick my genitals in the light socket, the attacker is to blame.\n\nwait...........what?\n\nSeriously though, this was bound to happen sooner or later to some major company working with credit card information. I'm assuming Microsoft, and Amazon, and others are breathing a massive sigh of relief it wasn't them, and are now taking far better measure to protect their users information.\n\nIn the end this means better security for everyone buying things on-line in the future. Because no company wants to be the next Sony after this.\n\nLike someone said previously XBox Live, Amazon and many other networks\/companies (even FBI and CIA) have been hacked before so stop making PSN sound so bad. The only big difference between PSN and other networks being hacked is that Sony turned off PSN to prevent further hacks, \"no one knows\" if other networks arent being hacked everyday and the network owners dont make it public.\n\nOn the other hand, I agree that Sony communication skills are not the best!\n\nAlso, I haven't read anyway that users information has been downloaded, I only know that someone had access to it...\n\neverything gets hacked, but what makes Sony different is that those hacks usually uncover a lot of security issues that are even for not security experts mind raping or shortly: \"How could they do that????\"\n\nI think the CCC's presentation, that showed how the xbox was hacked, showed their hard fight at every stage of the security system to find a workaround to run linux, while on Sony's side, once the first wall of obscurity fall, it uncovered a clearly wrong\/flawed implementation at it's fundamental stage.\n\nstoring private data of million of costumers in plain readable way is bad, no matter if it was stolen or no.\n\nI think it's clear for everyone, that nobody here says that those hackers are any good or better than sony, but those security holes on sony's side could be just as good uncovered by some random system failures or if they sale old HW and someone does an unformat or... and everybody would read plain text credit card informations of million of ppl.\n\nso, Hotz has a good point, they should really spend more money on engineers.\n\nJust out of curiosity, I wonder why we don't ever hear about the 'victims' of a security breach (like Sony in this case) being sued by the banks\/credit card issuers?\n\nIt seems to me that the card issuers are the ones that have to reissue millions and millions of credit cards on their dime and deal with write-offs from the resulting fraud-- and it seems like they wouldn't like that.\n\nEven small businesses have to show that their credit card processing software\/systems meet security standards (even if supplied by a 3rd party) in order to be allowed to process payments... It would makes sense (to me) that VISA\/Mastercard should have a minimum standard for security for institutions that *store* the data too."}

{"text":"The importance of Security for every Internet User\n\nThis past week, I presented at a large cybersecurity conference in Monterrey, Mexico. The conference wasand attended by many leading companies based in Latin America. Mexico is a gateway to Latin America from the United States and is important in a large number of ways to the cybersecurity of both the region and the global Internet community. Monterrey is a city that is home to a large number of multinational corporations and Mexico City, the country's capital, is also one of the world's largest cities. Both of these facts highlight the critical importance of Mexico to cybersecurity.\n\nOne issue raised during the conference is worth special attention. Some of the attendees expressed uncertainty about how the individual Internet user can contribute to cybersecurity. The view seemed to be that government and corporations have greater power to secure infrastructure, so the individual has only a minor role in cybersecurity. I believe this is a misguided view. This is much like saying that because the government maintains the roadways, that we can ignore the safety of cars on the roads. This is clearly illogical, yet the same view is sometimes applied to cyberspace. Individual Internet users may actually be increasing in importance to cybersecurity.\n\nFor years, Cybercriminals have harnessed the collective power of unsecured computers to operate \"botnets\" --groups of remotely controlled computers. These botnets are used to launch \"denial of service\" attacks against governments and companies. Such attacks can paralyze a business by blocking online communication channels. Botnets may also be used to send vast amounts of spam, some of which may even contain phishing attacks designed to infect new computers. Looking closer at the corporate environment, cybersecurity is only as strong as the weakest link. Some recent threats against industrial machines are believed to have been introduced by individuals who ignored good security practices and infected the systems.\n\nThe individual Internet user needs to follow good security practices not only for their own protection, but because of the critically important contribution that each individual makes to the security of the entire Internet eco-system. A lack of security at the individual level risks an entire government or corporate network. An individual infected device can also be used as part of a botnet to harm other individual users. For these reasons, the individual Internet user remains critically important to maintaining a safe Internet for everyone."}

{"text":"Air Force\n\nDigital threats detected by digital warriors\n\nSenior Airman Michael Washburn 355th Fighter Wing Public Affairs\n\nAs Senior Airman Ryan Brock, 355th Communications Squadron information assurance technician, sits at his desk, the glow of the computer screen illuminates on his face. He's looking for perpetrators of the digital kind. Those who unknowingly put D-M's computer network systems at risk.\n\nMost Airmen clearly know the Air Force Instruction not to plug in anything to a government computer that is not authorized. For others though, the AFI is a little murky. Network security goes sour when Airmen start plugging their personal equipment into government computers. Small things like hard drives and thumb drives can cause large headaches.\n\n\"If someone were to take an external hard drive home and plug it in to their computer which doesn't have proper virus definitions, when they plug it back into our network, our computers will have what the individual had,\" Brock said. \"This could be potentially anything including a trojan, a worm or it could be spybots that were placed there by the Russian government.\"\n\nIf an individual needs to get a hard drive for their office, they can't just go to the store and buy one. They need to go to their information assurance officer and let them know they need one. They can have one purchased using their unit's funds. The hard drive needs to have a 355th CS certification letter on it with the date, drive name, device serial number and approval number. It also needs to have the information assurance approval signature. Only then would it become an authorized hard drive.\n\nAlong with computer equipment, cell phones are also posing a problem.\n\n\"Most phones can basically act as a hard drive and they're usually always connected to the internet,\" Brock said. \"So, if someone plugs their phone into a computer, they just bypassed all the firewall security we have in place by introducing a straight internet source into the computer. That can be devastating from a network security standpoint.\"\n\nBrock states that people tend not to think about risks associated with phones.\n\n\"People don't have the same mindset when they're surfing the net on their phone like when they're on the computer,\" Brock said. \"On a computer, they're mindful of risks, but on a phone they don't think about it. It's really easy to get things introduced that way.\"\n\nJust as police officers keep crime at bay, Brock is primed to lay down the electronic law on those who put our system at risk.\n\n\"We have a script on our computers that will detect if anyone has anything plugged into the USB ports of their computer,\" Brock said. \"We're not looking for authorized items; we want to find unauthorized items.\"\n\n\"An email gets sent off to the communication squadron commander, the individual's supervisor and IAO,\" Brock said. \"I let them know who the violator was and what happened. The user will have their account disabled, and won't be able to unlock it until after they've completed the information assurance computer based training course. They have to come into the communication squadron building and retake it on a stand-alone computer. After that, they have to meet with the commander along with the individual's supervisor to explain what they did and why.\"\n\nThe idea is to discourage other individuals in that Airman's office from doing the same thing.\n\n\"Even if they're rushing, it's still going to be at least a day of down time,\" Brock said. \"We're not doing this to be mean. We're doing this because it's a serious problem that has shut down the system in the past. It may be embarrassing and frustrating, but it gets the point across.\"\n\nThe advice Brock gives is the same information they brief during rightstart.\n\n\"The thing we brief is to remember that every time someone is logged in, they are responsible for anything that happens on that system,\" Brock said. \"People need to know what's plugged into their computer. Don't plug in anything that isn't authorized, period"}

{"text":"Posted\nby\ntimothyon Sunday April 08, 2012 @07:59PM from the those-damn-corporations dept.\n\nAn anonymous reader writes \"The Utah Department of Health has been hacked. 181,604 Medicaid and CHIP recipients have had their personal information stolen. 25,096 had their Social Security numbers (SSNs) compromised. The agency is cooperating with law enforcement in a criminal investigation. The hackers, who are believed to be located in Eastern Europe, breached the server in question on March 30, 2012.\"\n\nYou should not hack in to systems you don't have permission to access. It is illegal, for the same reason it is illegal to break in to a house you don't have permission to access. It doesn't matter if you are capable of doing it, you shouldn't do it. Thus if you do, expect to be held criminally accountable.\n\nThis idea of blame the victims don't blame the criminals that so many on Slashdot have is stupid. Fine, I'll be ok with that so long as you are ok with it applying to the real world. You are ok with me being legally allowed to break in to your house, so long as I am able.\n\nThing is, I'd be very able. Your physical security is shit, as is everyone's. Individuals never bother with good security. You'll have a regular lock that is vulnerable to bumping, ice picking, and so on. That aside a shotgun with door breaching rounds will take it off the hinges no problem since you have no reinforcement on them. Your walls are probably made of drywall, wood framing and stucco, so a Sawzall can easily take care of that.\n\nYou don't choose to spend the time money or effort to secure your house further... Nor should you have to. Yet you think that if people don't have perfect computer security, well someone should be allowed in.\n\nAlso this is funny because show me this perfect security. Kernel.org was hacked, gnu.org was hacked, GitHub was hacked, BIND was hacked, and so on. So it isn't like just being open source and all that makes you immune. It seems that security holes happen, and that is just life.\n\nI wish the media will focus on how idiotic Heal Insurance companies are, especially in their IT usage. I work for a hospital and previously I worked for a start-up that did cutting edge medical technology. And let me tell you the insurance companies IT is just pure insane and stupid.\n\nThe government pushed a new electronic Bill form called 5010 which is an upgrade of 4010. These billforms are sent via EDI (Kinda of a Star Deliminator with a Tilda line feed, a throw back to old punch card technology) the difference between 4010 and 5010 are for the most part minor, and these changes were due January 1st. We are now in April. Now most of the insurance companies are compliment but there are other who are not, their test environment and production are very different and the test will allow different rules then production. So when a Hospital goes live after testing and getting clean tests they get rejection after rejection because they are not sending the right rules to the insurance company. Then they stick to the lie (The electronic format has the same data as the paper form) this is a Lie and absolute Lie! You call them on the lie and they will flat out deny you. Until you send the data and they reject you claims because there is data that isn't on the paper form, and some filds are on the paper from you Cannot fill in the electronic. Their checking system is insane. If they don't need that field you better not send it or your claim will get rejected.\n\nNow lets go over the transmission to the insurance companies... Method one. The old BBS. Yes thats right the old dial up BBS is still active. when writing scripts to automate connecting to the companies I see those old DOS base BBS's of the olden days, most of them have upgraded to allow ZMODEM transfer. Now the more modern one use Secure FTP. Secure FTP (not to be confused with sftp) as in you data channel is encrypted but not always your command channel. Or worse there are these VPN groups that many insurance companies get on where after you connect to the VPN then you normally FTP to the site... (where a rogue billing company can monitor the ports and see what goes on, because they happen to be in the VPN network)\n\nEveryone worries about HIPAA violations from the Health Care organization. For the most part now health care organizations have fare more modern and secure systems then the Insurance companies do. And if there are going to be a hack it will be in the insurance companies.\n\nNow you are going to say. This hack was with medicaid not a private insurance company. Well Medicare and Medicaid are operated by each state, and a lot of states in essence sold them off to an Insurance companies to do all the work. Because of the big numbers these companies often do it at a discount. However they will also cut corners to give more service to their higher paying premium customers. The reason why Medicaid and Medicare have the lowest percentage for administration costs, is because they are operated so lightly and push the work to the health care organization to do all the administration. Then they will pass the costs to their customers. And it make is that much more expensive because you have a bunch of smaller organization doing advanced administration who cannot do it as optimally as a larger company who can scale the administration costs.\n\nThese hacks and all hacks that steal information but no money, etc would be made pointless if the banking system and credit bureaus, had better validation requirements!!! But instead they want to defraud their customers and by selling credit and identity protection.\n\nActually, insurance companies want the uploads to fail. If they don't fail, then they actually have to pay money on a claim. They'd rather not do that, it goes against the bottom line.\n\nWhy anybody would wanna steal Medicaid ids is beyond me. To qualify for Medicaid you have to be poor. No way you'll be able to identity theft up a Gold Card with that info. If they weren't so broke they couldn't pay attention, they couldn't get Medicaid."}

{"text":"In an effort to protect the broader internet from the carelessness of a few, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), among others, is proposing a much broader adoption of something I've been encouraging for years \u2013 encouraging ISPs to take a greater role in protecting the Internet from the mistakes or carelessness of their own customers.\n\nThe idea is that ISPs would use a variety of tools to detect PCs that are infected with dangerous malware like bots, warn the owners of those computers about the infection, and help them clear it up. If the owner fails to clear up the infection, or becomes a repeat offender, the ultimate sanction could deny them access to the internet until they clear up their act.\n\nIt sounds draconian, and the FCC is not yet going that far. But it's already beginning to happen and may even be a good idea. As one commentator put it, when bad guys manage to infected thousands of personal computers and get them to work together, they have in effect a highly dangerous cyber weapon capable of causing significant damage to other computers and networks.\n\nIf you're not protecting your computer, it can easily be infected by all kinds of malware \u2013 malware that's becoming increasingly sophisticated. When criminals are able to infect enough computers to create a botnet, or network of bot-infected computers, they can then use that network to attack web sites, hide porn, and share stolen identities. Essentially use your personal computer to run their criminal enterprise.\n\nWhich is why the Federal Communications Commission is working even harder to encourage more IPSs to get tough on careless users. And some are paying attention. A couple of years ago Comcast announced the launch of Constant Guard, a free protection service for its customers that now includes bot detection \u2013 although so far it doesn't go as far as blocking Internet access for infected users.\n\nBut now the FCC wants all IPS to take part in this fight. In a recent speech, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski commented that \"ISPs can play a significant role in the battle against botnets. They can increase customer awareness so that users can look for signs that their computers are being used as bots, detect infections in customers' computers, notifying customers when their computers have become infected, and offer remediation support.\"\n\nHe added that ISPs can and must do this in a way that does not compromise consumers' privacy and that if other ISPs employed similar best practices, it could significantly reduce the botnet threat.\n\nAnd while he didn't go as far as suggesting more draconian measures if consumer education doesn't work, many security experts, including myself, believe sanctions against the worst and deliberate offenders are only a matter of time.\n\nThe best way we can all avoid moving in such an extreme direction is to take greater responsibility for protecting our own little corner of cyberspace. Guard your computers well \u2013 it's actually quite easy and you have no excuse not to.\n\nThe easiest options are to use multiple layers of malware-protecting software and most of this is now free. Keep your computer constantly patched and updated \u2013 this is also free and automated so you have to do little. And make sure you update your browser. The latest browsers have lots of great security tools built in that can offer solid defense against most of the threats that want to take over your computer.\n\nI've had the honor of being a member of the FCC's Cyber Security Working Group and I know how dedicated the FCC is to making the Internet safer for everyone. But they can't do it alone, and they shouldn't have to. Don't force your ISP to get tough with you. Protect your own corner of cyberspace and we all win.\n\nIn today's post, Intersections' Consumer Security Adviser Neal O'Farrell shares the results of a recent study on social network safety and security. Bottom line? People are becoming less \"social\" on social networks. Read on!\n\nWe've been monitoring and writing about the issues surrounding social networking safety and security for many years. During that time, we've been very concerned that no-one was really getting the Facebook safety and security message. We're glad we were wrong, because according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center's Internet Project & American Life, users of social networking sites (or SNS) are becoming more careful and acting more cautiously.\n\nAccording to Pew \"Social network users are becoming more active in pruning and managing their accounts. Women and younger users tend to unfriend more than others.\" About two-thirds of internet users now use some kind of social networking site, Facebook and Twitter being the most popular.\n\nOf these users:\n\n\u2022 63% of them have deleted people from their \"friends\" lists, up from 56% in 2009.\n\n\u2022 44% have deleted comments made by others on their profile.\n\n\u2022 37% have removed their names from photos that were tagged to identify them.\n\n\u2022 67% of women who maintain a profile say they have deleted people from their network, compared with 58% of men. Likewise, young adults are more active \"unfrienders\" when compared with older users.\n\n\u2022 A majority of social network site users \u2013 58% \u2013 restrict access to their profiles and women are significantly more likely to choose private settings.\n\n\u2022 More than half of social networking site users (58%) say their main profile is set to private so that only friends can see it.\n\n\u2022 19% set their profile to partially private so that friends of friends can view it.\n\nUnfortunately, some people just don't get the security message. At least one in every five social networking user says their main profile is set to be completely public. Women who use SNS are more likely than men to set the highest restrictions (67% vs. 48%).\n\nThe personal security situation could be even better, and safer, if users didn't have so many problems figuring out how to master their privacy settings. Half of SNS users say they have some difficulty in managing privacy controls. Those with the most education report the most trouble. In all, 48% of social media users report some level of difficulty in managing the privacy controls on their profile, while 49% say that it is \"not difficult at all.\"\n\nRegrets? Seems like some social networking users have had a few. According to the study:\n\n\u2022 About one in every ten social networking users have posted content they regret.\n\n\u2022 Young adults are also more prone to say they regret some of their social media postings; 15% of profile owners ages 18-29 say they have posted content they later regret, compared with just 5% of profile owners ages 50 and older.\n\nAlthough it's barely a month into 2012, there is a lot going on with security and privacy on the world's most popular social networking site \u2013 Facebook. Intersections' Consumer Security Adviser, Neal O'Farrell is here today to give us an update on several new Facebook security issues.\n\n2012 has already been an interesting year for Facebook security, with the emergence of some dangerous new scams and the unmasking of one of Facebook's most notorious cyber gangs.\n\nIn case you never heard of Koobface, it's a piece of malware that first emerged in 2008 and quickly infected millions of users. Users were tricked into downloading the malware by clicking on infected links on Facebook pages with messages like \"Lol, is this you in this video?\" These users were then enlisted into a giant international bot network of hijacked computers, at one point numbering close to one million computers, which in turn were used to engage in a variety of criminal activities that including pedaling fake anti-virus software.\n\nThe Koobface gang, as they became known, were able to generate millions of dollars in criminal gains, and all the while working out in the open, in plain sight, in the Russian city of St Petersburg. Until January 16th, when the New York Times and other outlets identified the five members of the gang and posted their photos across the world.\n\nApparently that did the trick, because Facebook just reported that they had finally wiped all traces of Koobface from Facebook, and that the command and control servers used to manage this massive criminal network appear to have gone silent.\n\nBut if everyone knows who these criminal are, and have known for some time, why were they not arrested? In a statement from Russian authorities, the answer is simple \u2013 no-one ever bothered to ask them to investigate or arrest them. While that's probably not the case, and Russian authorities have probably known about and tolerated the gang for years, it reminds us once again why so many of the world's most notorious hacking gangs work unimpeded from behind the Russian border.\n\nBut that might have been the only good news on the security front for Facebook. Just last week we talked about a dangerous new worm called Ramnit, which had apparently been merged with the highly dangerous Zeus banking Trojan and stealing Facebook passwords in the expectation (probably correct) that many Facebook users use the same password on other sites. Like their online banking.\n\nAnd that was followed by a Facebook ransomware attack, where Facebook users received messages claiming that as a result of some unusual activity their Faceook account had been suspended and they would have to pay a fee of around $30 in order to unlock it.\n\nThere are some important lessons to be learned here:\n\n\u2022 Probably the only way to defeat all these Facebook threats that keep emerging is for everyone to stop using Facebook. Criminals are only targeting Facebook because it's easy to pick the pockets of such large crowds.\n\n\u2022 It's like playing whack-a-mole with criminals. As soon as one gang or piece of malware has been neutralized, another takes its place. And often the replacement has learned from its predecessors, adapted itself, and become even more potent.\n\n\u2022 It's still down to users. Facebook is doing all it can (I assume) to counter all these threats. But if you really do love Facebook, you can help \u2013 by being more cautious, vigilant, and cynical when it comes to any unusual messages you receive. And of course, a strong and well-protected password would be greatly appreciated too.\n\nIntersections' Consumer Security Adviser Neal O'Farrell provides his comments and analysis of the recent privacy settlement between Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). A must read!\n\nAs a result of numerous complaints from a number of privacy advocates and organizations, the FTC finally launched its own investigation into Facebook's privacy claims and failings. According to the FTC's own statement, which announced the settlement on November 29th 2011, Facebook allegedly made many promises that it did not keep:\n\n\u2022 In December 2009, Facebook changed its website so certain information that users may have designated as private \u2013 such as their Friends List \u2013 was made public. They didn't warn users that this change was coming, or get their approval in advance.\n\n\u2022 Facebook represented that third-party apps that users' installed would have access only to user information that they needed to operate. In fact, the apps could access nearly all of users' personal data \u2013 data the apps didn't need.\n\n\u2022 Facebook told users they could restrict sharing of data to limited audiences \u2013 for example with \"Friends Only.\" In fact, selecting \"Friends Only\" did not prevent their information from being shared with third-party applications their friends used.\n\n\u2022 Facebook had a \"Verified Apps\" program & claimed it certified the security of participating apps. It didn't.\n\n\u2022 Facebook promised users that it would not share their personal information with advertisers. It did.\n\n\u2022 Facebook claimed that when users deactivated or deleted their accounts, their photos and videos would be inaccessible. But Facebook allowed access to the content, even after users had deactivated or deleted their accounts.\n\n\u2022 Facebook claimed that it complied with the U.S.- EU Safe Harbor Framework that governs data transfer between the U.S. and the European Union. It didn't.\n\nSpeaking about the issue on his Facebook page the very same day, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg insisted that \"Overall, I think we have a good history of providing transparency and control over who can see your information. That said, I'm the first to admit that we've made a bunch of mistakes.\"\n\nAt the same time he announced the appointment of two privacy officers \u2013 reminds me of Sony's announcement that after more than half a century in business it finally decided it would be a good idea to hire a head of security, only after hackers stole nearly 100 million user accounts. Better late than never, I suppose.\n\nThe settlement requires that Facebook can no longer conduct business as usual when it comes to privacy, cannot make any further deceptive privacy claims, and must get users' approval before it changes the way it shares their data.\n\nSpecifically, under the proposed settlement, Facebook is:\n\n\u2022 barred from making misrepresentations about the privacy or security of consumers' personal information;\n\n\u2022 required to prevent anyone from accessing a user's material more than 30 days after the user has deleted his or her account;\n\n\u2022 required to establish and maintain a comprehensive privacy program designed to address privacy risks associated with the development and management of new and existing products and services, and to protect the privacy and confidentiality of consumers' information; and\n\n\u2022It doesn't look like Facebook has to pay any fines or suffered any other punishments. It's simply on privacy probation for at least the next 20 years password"}

{"text":"Anonymous hacks Boston Police, publishes officer details\n\nAnonymous has hacked the servers of the Boston Police and other police-related sites, releasing the information late Friday in response to what they call unprovoked mass arrests and brutality experienced by Occupy Boston protesters on October 11.\n\nThe hacktivist group made public the passwords and usernames of 1,000 of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, as well as the names, addresses and social security numbers of 1,000 Birmingham, Alabama officers. The International Association of Chief of Police website was also targeted, and the group also released a client list and financials of the Matrix Group, a DC-based web design firm with law enforcement customers.\n\nSome of the sites hacked had homepages defaced and were replaced with an anti-police rap video. They claimed to have taken down 40 police-related websites, including the International Association of Chief of Police website that remained unreachable for the majority of the weekend.\n\n\"Let this be a warning to BPD and police everywhere: future acts of aggression against our movements will be met with a vengeance,\" the group said in a statement posted over at Pastebin.\n\nOn Friday evening, BPD addressed the situation: \"It has come to the attention of the Boston Police Department that various websites used by members of the BPD, including the website belonging to the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association have been hacked into and possibly compromised. In light of this information, the Boston Police Department is requiring all department personnel to secure their login information by resetting their passwords on the BPD network.\"\n\n\"I will confirm that it has happened, and there is an active federal and local investigation into it,\" said Thomas Nee, President of the BPPA when speaking with the Boston Herald yesterday.\n\nOccupy Boston members have stated that they did not ask Anonymous to do the hacking, but refused to publicly criticize the hacker collective saying they feared their own emails would be hacked.\n\nLast month the Austrian branch of Anonymous published the information of 25,000 police officers in protest of a proposed change to the law that would see telecommunications companies forced to save details of all telephone and internet traffic for a minimum of 6 months, and provide them to police when requested.\n\nUser Comments: 26\n\nAh yes, so they yet again base an attack on their tunnel-vision viewpoint of what they have perceived as a wrongdoing... Yet even the supposed \"victims\" of the wrongdoing won't condone their actions, which target and victimize an entire population of people (all police officers in this case) in an attempt at some type of misguided retribution. Sounds awfully familiar, rather like the ramblings and justifications that radical terrorists use for their actionsJust because Anonymous calls something police brutality doesn't mean I'm going to take their word for it. From what I've read, the Occupy Boston arrests were due to protestors stepping on certain property which they were repeatedly warned not to do, and did not have permission to do. They were trespassing. They disobeyed the law. Anonymous clearly supports these Occupy * movements. Anonymous is defending those who were arrested for disobeying the law. Anonymous subsequently disobeyed the law in 'defending' them.\n\nI abide by the law, Anonymous does not. Anonymous defends the breaking of the law through breaking the law. Anonymous labelled the arrests as \"police brutality\", however I've not found any evidence to support that outside of their word for it. They lied to you and sold you their BS. CongratulationsSo you're saying that Anon needs to lower themselves in order to make their point?\n\nI'd bet if you were an officer for the BPD, you'd have a very different view.\n\nThis kinda reminds me of when the kids at \/b\/ would find someone, like the lady putting the cat in the trash can, or whatever, and find their info and publish it so that they get some justice...except in this case, they published the information of everyone on the block that the cat lady lived on, you know, cause they live on the same block as her.\n\nI mean, why take the time to identify which officers were involved in any acts of brutality. Lets just target everyone who works for the department. Who cares, they're all guilty cause they wear a badge. Not as if the cops actually do anything for the public, they all just beat suspects, and abuse their authority. They never actually bring any thugs, killers, rapists, etc to justice. And of course, cue some punk kids commenting, cause some cop chased them off from trespassing, or doing something else illegal, so of course all cops are evil assholesReally? Oh right, you mean because they don't serve their own self-righteous agenda, don't feel the ends justify the means (however potentially destructive they are), don't care who gets hurt by their actions, and don't categorically apply bold strokes when blaming an entire facet of society for whatever their perceived injustices are? You should understand that I wasn't comparing the severity of the results, but the mentality and motivations of misguided actions.\n\nIf Anonymous had specifically targeted the police officers involved in the transgressions that they are protesting, and only exposed the personal information for those few, then I would have respect for them. Instead, they blanket attack an entire group for what they perceive as the sins of a few against their cause. That, my friend, is the cyber equivalent of walking a suicide bomber into a populated area and lighting a fuse, with zero regard for whether those in the blast zone are innocent or guilty. There is nothing idiotic about the comparison - either way they don't care about the collateral damage, as long as they can hurt someone and take credit for it to further their cause. The mentality is scarily similar between the 2 groups.\n\nI agree, yes going against Anon wont equal death or physical harm but it wont be pleasant either.\n\nI will say Anon have knowingly broken the law to enforce their own sense of justice, to a point where they have people scared to publicly criticize them for fear of repercussions, granted repercussions in this instance does not equal death like certain terrorist groups, but fear none the less. They also to appear to welcome and encourage this fear as well. Not to mention they went after the entire BPD, not individuals, most of which i assume were undeserving but guilty by associationAnonymous has always been an anarchist group. One of their key inspirations is Alan Moore's \"V for Vendetta\". The character V is a symbol for anarchist ideology and does whatever he must to bring down the totalitarian government.\n\nI don't know where the hacktivist label comes from but it really doesn't make much sense.\n\nAnonymous doesn't have \"branches\" or central leadership of any kind. When a member (or spectator in disguise) says he's the mouthpiece, he's not. That's either co-opted disinformation or someone outside describing their view of the insideI kindof disagree with both of you guys. I would say that are doing what they believe to be right. Meaning that, people shouldn't be herded like sheep by a federal or state force doing what they believe is right. Also, they quoted one person and I seem to believe it may be a biased statement, if it is even a statement at all and not a ramble from the editor. Police are good when they stop bad guys, but they are bad and overstepping when they start to punish us against the constitution. Federal government is the same way in that regard. They want you to be mindless and patriotic, calling anything against the US is unpatriotic and whatnot. However it would seem that if you look at it logically. It would almost be the opposite. I don't agree that rich people should have higher taxes like they do. (Im not rich by any means). But I also believe that poor people shouldnt be carried like they are today. I believe the government shouldnt have to pay for half the stuff it does today. I also believe that some paychecks need to be cut off in the White house and H.O.R. as well as benefits. Anyone else think they would give themselves a raise if they had the opportunity?\n\nAnyway, there are alot of things that need to change. But it seems like none cares, it's ok though. Keep watching your reality TV shows and just stay silent, you won't even notice your rights going into the garbage until it's too late.\n\nNobody here compared Anon to a \"murderous suicide civilian bombing terrorist.\" Yes, they have been called a terrorist, but a terrorist doesn't just kill people. Perhaps you should open the dictionary. Terrorism does not always involve death.\n\nAnd to those cheering them on...REALLY?! You see nothing wrong with posting names, addresses, and social security numbers of everyone in the department, even if they weren't involved? And did you even take the time to see WHY people get arrested at these protests? Of course not. I'm predicting Anon to hack the Houston PD again because of the arrests that were made yesterday. But Anon will ignore the reason why they were arrested, which is because the protesters were blocking the entrance of a bank, preventing people from going in and coming out. This is disruption of business, trespassing (as the bank owner asked them to move from the entrance and they didn't) and also a violation of safety codes. But hey, morons like you and Anon would never take the time to look these things upI have a friend who is a police officer (not in Boston) that had his information leaked a few months ago. It is not a joke. He and his family received death threats, he had to change all his phone numbers and online accounts, and they are hoping to move to a new address soon.\n\nIt is one thing to raise awareness of an incidence (the alleged police brutality), it is another to violate the privacy of thousands of individuals, especially when those individuals will likely become targets for all sorts of threats, spam, further hacking, and even violence."}
{"text":"Capitol College Hosts Events for National Cybersecurity Awareness Month\n\nLAUREL, MD (September 26, 2011) \u2013 October is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, and Capitol College is celebrating by hosting numerous events at the Laurel campus. Held every October since 2001, National Cybersecurity Awareness Month is a public awareness campaign that encourages everyone to protect their computers and the nation's critical cyber infrastructure.\n\nThe first event will bring Maryland MESA high school students to campus for a demonstration of Capitol's Cyber Battle Lab (CBL) on Friday Oct. 7. The CBL focuses on experiential learning, as students simulate, analyze and defeat cyber attacks. The lab is also helping the state of Maryland reach its vision of being \"cyber Maryland.\"\n\n\"Here, at Capitol College, the celebration of Cybersecurity Month takes on added significance,\" Dr. Vic Maconachy, vice president for academic affairs, said. \"We celebrate the expansion of our cybersecurity curriculum to the doctoral level of study. We celebrate the wonderful Cyber Battle Lab, which our state has helped us build. We celebrate the introduction of cybersecurity topics and labs into many of the various curricula we offer. Most of all, we use this time to rededicate ourselves to doing our part in securing our nation's critical information infrastructures.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Oct. 13, the \"Cyber Battle Lab Showcase\" event will highlight the advances made in the CBL throughout its first year.

{"text":"We always hear about \"hacking\" (or cracking) banks, websites or the like. Nothing really \"important\" like centrals, or even satellites (like TV channels). Those we only see in movies - but are they possible?\nCould one crack a TV satellite, or something like that? Or is it really impossible\/too secure?\n\nIf it is possible though, what skills would be needed to do it? I'm sure it doesn't take just nmap and SQL injections to enter that kind of network, does it?\n\nI heard those kind of infrastructures relied on SCADA systems and needed special programming to be exploited: what programming languages would be needed then?\n\nI honestly have no idea what you are asking. You go from TV's to SCADA. You need to be more specific. \u2013 RookApr 26 '12 at 20:01\n\n@Rook I'm just giving several examples. I know TV networks have little to do with SCADA but they're both a very difficult target, no? I'd just like to know if cracking into those kinds of networks (be they SCADA, satellites or whatever) is possible, and if yes, with which techniques\/languages. \u2013 John MorganApr 26 '12 at 20:05\n\n3 Answers\n\nWhat about RSA? They SHOULD be one of the most secure Digital Fortresses on the planet, but hackers got in with an email. Same with the US Dept. of Energy.\n\nSometimes attacking something directly is just too costly or time consuming. As Sun Tzu says, \"Victory is more important than winning battles.\"\n\nIf you want to show superiority in skill over your target, then you have to be more skilled. Critical systems as you mention raise the bar on being able to defeat them, so a simple SQL Injection may or may not be successful (but that's why we do penetration testing: so see where the bar is set).\n\nIf you want to be victorious, then you need to transcend your target to see a wider battlefield. Then, a simple email can open all doors.\n\nThere's the famous story of a pen tester who got root access to a company's core server simply by bribing the sysadmin for half his promised reward... \u2013 tdammersApr 27 '12 at 8:32\n\nAnd the pen testers who littered the company parking lot with flash drives that contained rootkits, and the whole 'password for a candybar' story. Perhaps to answer the OP better, it's not the systems that can be easy to crack, even if they are \"important\", it's the people running those systems that have shown to be vulnerable. \u2013 schroederApr 27 '12 at 14:01\n\nI recall an old joke that went something like this: the only secure system is one that is inaccessible to anyone.\n\nWith that said, any system is subject to some level of compromise. If a target system is connected to a larger network, that increases the threat surface. There are some systems that require physical access (i.e. no network connectivity). Even those systems are subject to mission impossible-style physical access attempts.\n\nNo single programming language will help you learn or exploit complex systems, SCADA or otherwise. If you're really interested in learning, learn all you can about everything - from programming languages to operating systems to networking protocols to cpu\/memory architecture. It's a high barrier to entry.\n\nThis is very vague. Is it possible? Most definitely, yes if proper precautions aren't met or if privileged users can be socially engineered or forced into giving up authentication details.\n\nIs it easy? It shouldn't be. Nmap\/SQL injections would only work if the controlling device is internet connected to a public web interface, which they shouldn't be. At a minimum you should have to go through say a VPN before getting to something that controls critical resources. (Not to say VPNs don't have zero day vulnerabilities; or users don't reuse passwords\/leave keys lying around).\n\nGranted if its a satelite that receives commands via radio, you could possibly build your own antenna, send bogus commands, etc. But likely commands are encrypted, kept secure, and use timestamps\/nonces\/sequence numbers in the encrypted message (no replay attacks)."}

{"text":"Shocker: Sony hacked again, over a million accounts compromised\n\nIt's time for another installment in the never-ending saga of Sony's security blunders. Hackers have reportedly infiltrated the company's movie site, accessing the sensitive information of more than a million accounts. The group, known as LulzSec, claims to have breached SonyPictures.com and swiped users' passwords, email and home addresses, dates of birth, along with any information submitted as part of Sony's data opt-ins.\n\nDetailing the attack on PasteBin, LulzSec said it penetrated the company's infrastructure with a rudimentary SQL injection. Described as \"one of the most primitive and common vulnerabilities,\" the group said it accessed everything with a single injection. In a truly embarrassing discovery, LulzSec reports that none of the user information was encrypted. In other words, Sony stored more than million user passwords in plaintext.\n\n\"Why do you put such faith in a company that allows itself to become open to these simple attacks?\" the group said. \"This is disgraceful and insecure: they were asking for it.\" LulzSec has published the stolen data on The Pirate Bay. Besides tons of sensitive user information, the group included some 20,000 Sony music coupons, 67,000 \"music codes,\" as well as the layout of Sony's database in case you want to pillage it yourself.\n\nThis breach follows a string of recent misfortunes. Sony was forced to disable its PSN and Qriocity services for more than a month after a massive security breach that affected tens of millions of users. That fiasco is projected to cost the company some $171 million and constributes to a massive $3.1 billion loss for its fiscal year 2010. Sony has faced several other attacks in recent months, which are becoming too numerous to list.\n\nUser Comments: 61\n\nI just want to comment, didn't feel like reading all of 'em but here it goes,\n\nIf you hack,\n\nDo it to break into the system and prove that you can. They will know that you did. Hell send them an email with all the user information and what not. But posting it onto a torrent site and what not? Seriously? LulzSec you are a disgrace as true hackers. DO NOT post sensitive information like that ANYWHERE. Now you have the law unfortunately that's going to toss you into jail and have you give crying blowjobs to Mister Bubba.\n\nlol when it rains it pours. People been saying forever sony screws people over they had it coming. . Well so does the government, and countless other companies. Hackers need to grow a pair and hack someone of a challenge, sony is to easy.\n\nI must disagree with your statement. This is not only justified but needed, I'm not against Sony or anything like that but as a user I feel this empower us, meaning more secure companies and more secure data. Up until now who could say this has not happened before maybe at smaller scales and people were proffiting out of this and we could have never ever guessed about it.\n\nThis could bring more laws to protect our data and information and I'm all for it\n\nI agree with your last sentence especially - Its frankly unacceptable to keep information regarding customers of a private, or sell-able nature, unencrypted.\n\nIf you hold such information, you should expect the worse case scenario, and therefore be prepared for it. It really makes you wonder if Sony has learnt anything from the previous hacks that left their whole system wide-open.\n\nIf a company stores our information, it should be encrypted, end of story.\n\n>>If you see a car parked somewhere with the keys on the door and you just take it, whose fault it is it was stolen? The dumbarse who left the keys on the car door, the dude who just took it, both?\n\nI'm sick of arguments like this. That and the 'breaking into a house' thing.\n\nIt's more like this:\n\nYou are having dinner with your husband\/wife at a fancy hotel. You let the valet park your sports car for you, with the reasonable understanding that they will take care of it for you. Instead, they park it in the street, unlocked and with the keys in the ignition. All because they were too busy that night.\n\n-OR-\n\nYou leave important documents in a safety deposit box at a reputable bank. Except they routinely left the safe unlocked, the codes written on a post-it note below the keypad and their security cameras were faulty. You would be much more forgiving if they had a full-scale robbery, with people shot and the safe broken into by force.\n\nIf it's your information and your valuables, then the extent to which you secure the car\/house\/whatever is up to you. If it someone else's information and valuables then do your darndest.\n\nThat said, I don't condone the actions of the hackers. But if a company is going to ask for and keep your personal information, they should be required by law to look after it properly. That said, you can't defend against every contingency. But seriously, SQL injection??\n\nWTF, Sony! What kind of messed up company solicits your personal information and leaves it completely vulnerable to an SQL injection? Are you for real??? So angry. God I hate you, Sony.\n\nAnd is there even really a question as to whose fault this is? What is with you people? Let me tell you, if a bank uses bubble gum to secure the money I deposited there, I WILL NOT BE BLAMING THE BURGLAR WHEN IT GETS ROBBED.\n\nUsing your argument in front of a judge will still result in the thief going to jail. The valet may end up with egg on their face and may lose some business but little would happen to them. While if I was a victim in your statement, I would be upset with the valet, but I would be really pissed at the thief.\n\nIn the end just because someone comes across a car on the street with the keys in the ignition and the motor running and windows down, does not excuse the theif from taking \"WHAT IS NOT HIS\/HERS\".\n\nLets take your example a step further. Lets say you left you checkbook on the car seat when the valet parked it. Now instead of the theif stealing the car they take the checkbook and because they thought it was funny and a great way to teach the owner a lesson, posted blank checks all over town for anyone to come by and pick up and use. A few people go out and get fake ID's and cash checks all over the state. Ruining the owners credit, draining their bank account and causing al manor of hardship to you and your family.\n\nWhy does a person or group decide they are the ones to pass judgement on others and are more than willing to commit crimes to deliver this judgement....how is this justice?\n\nAll you hacker supporters seem to think that they are doing a service to the great unwashed masses. They are not! They are little more than vandles at best and identity thieves at worst.\n\nWhat I feel is honestly sad in this is a hacker use to be a person\/group that would find security holes and expose them, SO THEY WOULD GET IT FIXED.\n\nHard to believe that Sony has been caught with their pants down yet again. Protecting customer confidential information is clearly not as important to them as protecting their precious intellectual property."}
{"text":"Legislation to Protect Against Cyber Attacks is Stuck in Congress; Israel Calls for Swift Passage\n\nHauppauge, NY\u2014 Today, Congressman Steve Israel (D-Huntington) joined local tech companies to call for legislation to better protect Long Island businesses and reduce our risk of a cyberattack. Technicians demonstrated how easy it is to hack into a computer and retrieve sensitive information, even with the latest anti-virus software.\n\nRep. Israel said, \"Failing to protect ourselves from cyber espionage or cyber attack is to leave our intellectual property vulnerable to theft. We know that a successful widespread and potent attack could plunge us into blackouts, devastate commerce, disrupt communications, paralyze transportation, and more. Congress must get past its partisan gridlock before our nation is truly in danger and pass legislation that would allow government agencies to share information quickly with businesses.\"\n\nPaul Trapani, CEO of Fuoco Tech, a local IT support firm, said, \"I applaud Congressman Israel's efforts to make the general public more aware of cyber security issues. A lot of people that are not in the security or computer industry are unaware of how easy it is for a cybercriminal to gain access to sensitive information. While networks and computers have gained a certain measure of security, the growing pervasiveness of wireless networks, that are often unsecured, has created potential for more attacks and security compromises. In our industry we are well aware that the moment a computer is connected to the internet it starts being scanned for vulnerabilities.\"\n\nPeter Goldsmith, President of LISnet, a network for Long Island software and technology firms, said, \"The world has been made smaller through technology, with exciting changes happening almost daily. But technology has an enemy with people trying to create problems, so the need for Cyber Security is vital at all levels, from your home to our country.\"\n\nJust last week, General Keith Alexander, the top U.S. military official in charge of protecting the United States from cyberattacks, reported a 17-fold increase in attacks against our infrastructure between 2009 and 2011. And, on a \"preparedness scale\" of one to 10, he assigned a level of only three. And our electricity grids, water supplies, computer and cell-phone networks and other infrastructure are increasingly coming under attack.\n\nThe House passed the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) in April 2012 to ensure a better response to cyberattacks by providing sensible information sharing between businesses and government. The Senate yesterday failed to end a filibuster on their Cybersecurity Act of 2012 delaying action on the measure."}

Hey, he gave the lion a heart, or something like that, didn't he? Or, the tin man? Whatever - go see the Wizard of Aus.\n\nThe privileged group of more than 300 companies under CERT Australia's wing is expanding, but it does not plan to offer the secretive information more broadly.\n\nThis is corporate welfare at its finest: make the people pay to give a competitive advantage to particular companies.\n\nWhen will this primitive targets-based, public-private-partnership experiment born somewhere in the '80s finally collapse? When will parties and their representation in government reflect the people again? Whether left or right, authoritarian or socially liberal, your view is no longer represented unless you've paid for it.\n\nit makes sense that corporations take these risks, profit, then they are absorbed. the point is, corporations are never going away, because they do make sense for many reasons in terms of the most efficient way to do things. however, they are like beasts of burden: you must harness them and put them to use, or they run roughshod over your society. like GE, which paid no taxes to the USA, where the corporation is corrupting our system of government to stand above the people:\n\nadditionally, we are making progress. the labor movement a hundred years ago made a huge step forward (that yes, we are backsliding on now)... after the civil war, corporations had a larger military than the federal govt, to suppress labor. blackwater is a hiccup in comparison:\n\n2 steps forward, 1 step back. this struggle is going on for centuries. but please do not forget we ARE making progress against the corruption of the people's will by monied interests. it is very difficult, and takes time and much effort. today, they have an entire corporate propaganda machine, fox news, that incenses the poor and middle class to actually fight against their own interests, like affordable healthcare. it is absurd, but realfox news, that incenses the poor and middle class to actually fight against their own interests\n\nYou don't understand these people.\n\nOK, an analogy of sorts: I don't shoplift. It's against my interest to not shoplift. Why then, do I not shoplift? I have this feeling that taking stuff from other people is wrong. Yes, I know, I'm being stupid and I should just do what is in my best interest. I also get really pissed off when other people shoplift, even if I'm not the shopkeeper and even if I don't see it happen. Perhaps you feel differently?\n\nIf I choose to buy insurance, I'm choosing to gamble. I may \"win\" by getting expensive care provided to me, or \"lose\" by staying healthy and getting nothing.\n\nIf I'm forced to buy insurance (private or government) then I'm being forced to gamble. My choice has been taken from me. Maybe I want to gamble, and maybe I don't, but taking away the choice is not OK.\n\nI don't feel right taking your choice from you. Please don't take mine from me.\n\nif you are young and healthy and have no health insurance, but you break your arm, we do not inquire as to your bank account before treating you. we treat you. then, being poor, as most young people are, you avoid the bill, or declare bankruptcy. what a nice society\n\nthis is the way it has been for decades: the state and feds constantly reimbursing hospitals for unpaid bills so thehospitals don't go under. in other words, we already have universal healthcare, that you already pay for, i\n\nThere is that problem, yes. It is reasonable for the government to cover the cost of treating everybody who is unable to shop around for low prices and think about payment. The free market is broken if you have a bullet in your heart; there is no time to compare prices or decide if medical care is not worthwhile.\n\nFor a broken arm, there is no reason you should get treatment without payment. It's not immediately life threatening, it doesn't impair your ability to phone doctors, and you can wait.\n\nI'm far from a free market fundamentalist. I recognize that there are times when a free market is impossible, I'm paranoid about the instability that leads to monopoly and too-big-to-let-fail situations, and I strongly support taxing externalities like pollution.

So here's a question, what do you mean when you say this? Do you mean make sure the network the air-conditioner is on is physically isolated from the Internet? Or do you just mean \"isolated\" via some router magic or other. I say this knowing that the situation on the ground is that there is hardly a network in any system that is physically isolated. Prett\n\nI integrate, deploy, and maintain a SCADA system for a large water and waste-water utility.\n\nHere are some facts on the ground:\n\n1. Yes, the software is out of date, and it is poorly reviewed. The reason is that the market is small, the deployment costs are huge, and it is difficult to differentiate the bad from the worse. The effort required to swap out SCADA or control system software make similar office operations look trivial.\n\n2. Yes, the flaws are hard to fix. We design these things for safety, and reliability, first. We have an ethical duty to turn the CIA model upside down to become the AIC model. Security is often an afterthought. In any case, most of you probably do not realize that security for an industrial process is very different from security for an office. In an office, if the computer stops, the whole office process stops and that's it. Nothing more happens. In an industrial process, the physics and chemistry of the process will continue to do something whether your control system is online or not. In other words, unlike in an office,3. Industrial processes can't \"just shut down\" on a whim. To patch a control system you need to get to a place where the process can be safely shut down, and the new process can be safely validated to prove that it does everything that is expected of it. Getting this much time and attention from people takes significant down time. With the lean operations that most places run, that kind of downtime may not be available for an entire SEASON.\n\n4. Because of this, revealing software flaws is often a dangerous proposition. By the time we can safely patch something in an industrial control system, there may be tool kits for script kiddies.\n\n5. Due to safety concerns, almost nobody will seriously consider an effort to spray patches to the field. Again, this is not the office. The penalty for getting things wrong could be deadly. Automated patching without careful testing on each stage of the process can be a firing offense in some companies.\n\nI believe that the theory that the Australian CERT is using is that by keeping some flaws quiet, they reduce the chance that others may develop script kiddie development kits. I honestly do not know whether this can work, but I give them credit for trying. It will be interesting to see what metrics they use to prove this effort is effective.\n\nFinally, please stop with the \"industrial software is crap\" nonsense. We engineers know that all too well; but there are no better alternatives. Would you like to see us go back to the days when everything was run with pneumatic controls or analog computers? I'll bet you wouldn't appreciate the prices you'd pay. If you like electricity and running water, find ways to write better software.\n\nI write SCADA software for one of the top 5 players (anonymous for obvious reasons). I resent your implication that the software is poorly written. I have worked for many different software companies, and the standard at this one is the highest of any of them. It must be; SCADA software is designed to run for many months at a time, flawlessly. SCADA software is infinitely configurable, and often includes a scripting language, which means that it cannot be statically verified (unlike a lift control system fo\n\nThe truth is that the software industry marches forward at a much faster pace than we can deploy. Today's ultra reliable souped up cool stuff becomes yesterday's \"what the hell were they thinking?\" stupidity very quickly. In truth, it's not just about the code YOU write, it's the code that OTHERS write. They're making assumptions about your work and you're making assumptions about their work. Those assumptions are often wrong.\n\nFrom my perspective as an end user, I often can not see the dividing line between you and your component software companies. I often can not tell whether you're using VxWorks, an embedded version of BSD, or some small company's custom RTOS. So whatever you do to improve your code may be irrelevant if the host OS crashes. From where I sit, the end result is the same.\n\nThat said, stability in most embedded OSs is usually pretty good. But the issue here is not stability. The issue is whether the software can stand up to even a mild attack. I once saw someone attack a SIL rated PLC with a LAND attack (names of guilty parties redacted to protect industry). The PLC curled up and crashed.\n\nI would like to be able to say better things, but I have seen otherwise. Sorry...\n\nWe have an ethical duty to turn the CIA model upside down to become the AIC model.\n\nThe CIA Triad itself isn't inherently weighted to value one principle over another.\nYou make the differentiation between the office process and industrial by saying:\n\nYes, the flaws are hard to fix. We design these things for safety, and reliability, first.... In an office, if the computer stops, the whole office process stops and that's it.... In an industrial process, the physics and chemistry of the process will continue to do something whether your control system is online or not.... If you crash a control system, the process keeps doing something, even if it is something that nobody would ever want.\n\nI'm assuming you're saying that safety and reliability is more important than security? How can you possibly treat a known and reproducible attack vector as anything less than a safety and reliability issue? I just don't understand this logic, security issues should be treated just\n\n> I integrate, deploy, and maintain a SCADA system for a large water and waste-water utility.\n\nWhat development platform do you use?\n\n>I don't even understand this bit or else you're just talking techno waffle and I've worked in ths industry for\n\nFirst of all, this is called honeypotting but without the benefit of actually having complete control over the monitoring, logging and the PCs to be compromised... oh wait... maybe they do. I wonder if the rest of Australia is okay with their government withholding information and using them as \"bait\" while at the same time not being particularly capable of a wide-spread law enforcement activity?\n\nWhat a bunch of lunatics thinking they are so omnipotent in their \"secret\" knowledge they can outsmart everyone by being so secretive. The only real benefit to this that I can see is that (presuming they are able to be as secretive as they claim, a big if) the obvious inevitable downsides to this strategy will not be obvious to the public because they are secret. Basically, by taking the whole world off their bench and pretending to be able to do the work of the wider public in secret they will inevitablely"}

Said customer has a bunch of Solaris boxes, which are used as file servers, running Samba. Obviously, in such a setup you would want to have a single source of login credentials, the Active Directory (with UNIX support added) being a good choice. winbind, a part of Samba, does just that. Now with the existing W2k3 infrastructure, all is fine with the old 3.0 version of Samba. However, Server 2008 moved to NTLMv2, which Samba 3.0 doesn't understand. One could turn off NTLMv2, but this is equivalent to an open invitation to pwn all the boxes, so moving forward to a newer Samba is without alternative.<\/p>\n<p>Ok, so I got myself the latest stable Samba source (3.5.6 at time of writing), spent a day or so installing a gazillion of packages on Solaris to have a working compilation environment, sweared a bit into the general direction of Heimdal, but ended up with a compiled samba. Another day of swearing, removing Solaris-packaged pam_winbind and nss_winbind libraries and replacing them with the freshly-compiled ones, and I was able to join the AD domain. Yay.<\/p>\n<p>Just that it didn't work.<\/p>\nI double-checked nsswitch.conf, smb.conf, krb5.conf, pam.conf etc., but found no mistake. According to the documentation, all was well.

Ok, it keeps forgetting I joined the domain once a day, but other than that, I was able to make it work.<\/p>\n<p>Barely.<\/>\n<p>I could authenticate and access the smb shares. However, samba would pull a uid out of thin air, instead of using the one stored in AD (which, by the way, does so in a standard-compliant way, using the schema from rfc2307). Ok, more document reading, and I found there was a idmap plugin for AD, which was supposed to do the right thing. I followed the documentation, and lo and behold, domain user login stopped working for good.\n<p>Imagine a day of trying to make sense of the Samba logs and frantic googling here.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I found a clue in the samba.org <a href=\" There's a section there talking about the use of AD for idmap.

Unsuccessfully, as you might have guessed. The initial problem was that the build process didn't bother to compile and install the idmap ad module. That was easy to do manually. However, upon loading this module, Samba would complain about:<blockquote>Error trying to resolve symbol 'init_samba_module' in \/usr\/local\/samba\/lib\/idmap\/ad.so: ld.so.1: winbindd: fatal: init_samba_module: can't find symbol<\/blockquote>Rats.<\/p>\n<p>Next step: I grep for this symbol in the source. Imagine my surprise to find out that this symbol is referenced exactly twice in the entire source code, both calls to dlsym(), related to loading the module. In the 30 or so modules however, not a single trace of this symbol can be found! I considered some black magic generating the symbol on the fly, but inspection of the .so with power tools (\"string\") confirmed the symbol is just missing.<\/p>\n<p>Ok, so how did it work on Ubuntu, then?<\/p>\n<p>Back to that box, and checking ad.so there. To my mild surprise, I found the symbol in the .so file, unlike on Solaris. Ok, <code>apt-get source samba<\/code>. And guess what, it downloaded an extensive patch (a whopping 136806 lines), which among other things contains code to add a <code>#define idmap_ad_init init_samba_module<\/code> line to confdefs.h. And that makes it work.<\/p>\n<p>FFFFUUUUUUUU!!!<\/p>\n<p>To sum it up, Samba documentation has been outdated in important parts, and the code base is in such a sorry state that it doesn't even properly build a single plugin, and all this must have been going on for years now. This implies a lot about the QA that's going on in the Samba project. My guess is somebody forgot to turn off the light at samba.org and tell us it doesn't exist anymore.<\/p>Wed, 27 Oct 2010 14:24:34 GMT pointer exploit mitigation in Mozilla of the classic vulnerability patterns in software is use-after-free, i.e., some pointer is accessed by the program even after the memory it points to has been returned to the memory management system. If an attacker can control the memory layout of the region pointed to, by getting the system to allocate some other object there, she gets into the position where control over program flow, and thus code execution, is feasible.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\" people<\/a> have recognized this as an issue, and developed a mitigation strategy:\n<blockquote>\n\"Our approach is to prevent the first phase of the attack by making it impossible to overwrite fields of deallocated objects with values of the wrong type. We do this by ensuring that whenever the memory used by a deallocated frame object is reallocated to a new object, the new object must always be exactly the same type as the old object and at exactly the same address. Thus whenever code writes a value to a field of the new object, the value must be valid for the type T the program expects when it access that location through a pointer to the new object *or* the old object. Thus, dangling-frame-pointer attacks cannot get started.\"\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/p>\n<p>This approach indeed makes it harder for an attacker to do something about a use-after-free situation. Now of course this pattern, together with its cousin, the double free, only appears in software that uses manual memory management. It would be entirely possible to use the <a href=\" conservative garbage collector<\/a> for automatic memory management in Mozilla, and there wouldn't be any use-after-free oder double-free problems to worry about.\n<\/p>\n<p>I might be getting old and cynical here, but I fail to understand how people can be proud of such a kludgy workaround when real, solid solutions are available. Using a GC would also help against Mozilla's still present memory leaks...<\/p>Sun, 17 Oct 2010 10:50:40 GMT"}
{"text":"Cyber attacks can be costly to prevent\n\nAs wars and espionage increasingly move from the real to the virtual world, the EU is planning to force European companies to invest more in cyber security, but the cost of building electronic defences may be high\n\nToday's most sophisticated terrorist attacks and attempts to disrupt an enemy's critical infrastructure rely more on digital means rather than traditional real world equipment and personnel. A hacker in a garage can be more disruptive and can create more panic than a dynamite-belted kamikaze exploding in a market during shopping hours. The western world has been on both sides of the cyber-attack scenario. First, it has been a victim. A well-known example was the 2007 cyber-attack on Estonia's electronic infrastructure, which commentators believe was carried out by Russian agents. Following the relocation of a Soviet-era war memorial in April 2007, Estonian authorities faced riots and protests led by the sizeable Russian community that live in the country. The civil disobedience was followed by large-scale 'distributed denial of service' attacks on several strategic websites including the country's banks, government ministries and public services.\n\nFor a while Estonia experienced an internet black-out. For a country which prides itself on being one of the most digitised in the world, the cyber-attack was an unexpected sign of vulnerability. Panic spread in the streets of Tallinn, the picturesque capital of the Baltic state, as people were denied access to their online bank accounts. The attack pushed the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to intensify their efforts against electronic attacks. Cyber security rapidly became a hot topic in meetings at the highest levels. The annual NATO Summit in Bucharest, in April 2008, reserved a significant part of its agenda to cyber defence. New dedicated bodies were established and Tallinn became the seat of the NATO cyber defence centre.\n\nA few years later, the west showed that cyber warfare is not only a matter of defence but also of attack. It is widely believed that Israeli and American cyber experts created Stuxnet, a malicious software virus considered to be one of the most sophisticated cyber weapons ever used. It is understood that the computer worm was able to seriously damage Iran's nuclear infrastructure, setting Teheran's plans to run a nuclear programme back by several years. A recent spin-off from Stuxnet is Duqu. Pundits call it 'the mother of all Trojans'. Although information about Duqu is still opaque and contradictory, the virus seems to be the most advanced programme for the purpose of stealing sensitive information. It could even be used for attacks against industrial control systems.\n\nIn this context, it is increasingly clear that cyber wars \"are not anymore relegated to technical people, but have become a mainstream topic,\" as cyber adviser to Hillary Clinton Chris Painter put it during a conference in Brussels last week - hosted by the Security and Defence Agenda think-tank. The subject increases in importance as the virtual dangers grow. \"So far, cyber threats have come mainly from organised crime but we have to be aware that there will be an increased use of espionage on the internet,\" European Network and Information Security Agency executive director Udo Helmbrecht had previously acknowledged.\n\nIf security has to be improved, the private sector will have a crucial role to play as it owns 90 per cent of critical infrastructure in the EU - according to data provided by Europol, the law enforcement agency. \"But the industry does not always do enough to protect security,\" said a European Commission official, who specialises in cyber security issues. A key tool to increase the private sector involvement, and investment, in security is to make it compulsory to disclose breaches. To avoid the consequences on reputation of such disclosures, companies are likely to fight against this - goes the argument.\n\nWe know that EU rules already envisage an obligation to report security breaches for the telecoms and internet sectors. In January, Brussels proposed to tighten the existing legislation; obliging electronic communication services to report any data and security breaches within a strict deadline. The move was pushed by the consumers' protection champion Viviane Reding, who is in charge of justice at the commission. As the proposal is going through the long legislative process in Brussels, industry is lobbying hard to soften its stance and to avoid having to carry the extra costs of beefing up security.\n\nThe bad news for industry does not end with that proposal. In fact, Reding's plan attracted the attention of some of her colleagues in the commission. Neelie Kroes, in charge of information society issues, is studying the idea of extending reporting obligations to other sectors beyond telecoms. \"The European Commission will propose by the end of the third quarter of 2012, a new obligation for security breach notifications for the energy, transport, banking and financial sectors,\" said a Kroes' aide at the SDA conference. And the private sector will clearly have to cooperate if Europe wants to equip itself with cyber walls, which are thick enough to shield it from more sophisticated and disruptive attacks. The security bill is likely to be expensive. But it will certainly be lower than the costs of restoring disrupted infrastructure post-attack."}
{"text":"When it comes to countries, there are no friends. There are enemies and there are non-enemies. That is about as good as it gets. Despite strong ties between the U.S. with the U.K. and Israel just to pick a few names, that has not stopped espionage on all three countries against each other.\n\nI read a thriller novel which was rather action based, but had an interesting premise. At an American station in Antarctica an alien vessel is discovered locked in the ice. A crack American Marine squad is the closest and is rushed to protect the base.\n\nUnfortunately the French have their own South Polar base and they send in their own team. The U.S. team must rescue the base from the French occupation. But before the dust even settles they find out that the best British assault commander is on the way to take the base for the U.K. More mayhem ensues.\n\nThe point being that when it comes to a situation where there is a chance to significantly alter the balance of power in the world, their ARE no friends between countries.\n\nCyber warfare hasn't really been defined yet. It obviously is an \"attack\" against another nation. But to me, it is kind of the opposite of espionage. Espionage being illegal gathering of information against other countries. Cyber attacks are an illegal destruction of information against other nations.\n\nThe gathering and\/or destruction of information valuable to nations has been going on for as long as there have been nations. From that perspective it is not warfare in any traditional sense.\n\nCyber attacks are an illegal destruction of information against other nations.\n\nIt is much more than that if you include my hacking the drones by imitating the GPS network example I just gave. That would be a real military attack. The government uses encrypted GPS signals in military drone, of course, but that is simply a problem of cracking the codes used. The same method may have been used to bring down a US drone in Iran in 2011 which was the point of the exercise.\n\nThere will be other ways in which Cyber technology could be turned against an opponent by an aggressor. We just haven't thought of them here yet, but I'm sure many people are busy working on them right now, being paid large sums of money from the tax revenues raised from you and me.\n\nIt looks like Cyber warefare is now just part and parcel of being a nation state.\nIran have been subjected to attacks by the US-Israel and are looking to take themselves off-line, into a national intranet in an attempt to stop the attacks.\n\nOnce you start deploying these weapons and legitimizing their use, sooner or later someone is going turn that back on you. Unlike nuclear weapons, any country in the world can get involved in cyber warfare, at relatively low cost. You can bet that a lot of countries are looking into that right now. With the US as the target.\n\nIran is a small fish. Unleashing these weapons against them might bring immediate results but down the line the blowback for the US might be far worse. The rumoured Chinese attack may just have been a test or a shot across the bows, but China currently has no motive to bring down the US economy. Other countries may see things differently.\n\nI have a friend who is employed in evaluating the computer vulnerabilities of large corporations. As part of his job he would break into the clients system using his PC in his office. He never failed to get in. He would use the same attack methods that are common knowledge in the cyber-community and exploit known vulnerabilities. Most large corporations can't keep all of their thousands of computers up to date with security patches and he only needs to find one that isn't protected.\n\nMy favorite story from him was one where a IT director was boasting that his system was airtight. My friend got into the system in less than 15 minutes and in the initial meeting handed him a one page synopsis of his personal bank information, social security status, medical history, job history...\n\nHe has encountered eastern European gang attacks on his clients servers, he has analyzed drug gang communications that have better encryption than most countries.\n\nHe also worked pro bono with law enforcement and got information that led to arrests of child pornographers in Europe and the US.\n\nHe said the only computer system he couldn't eventually get into was the one not connected to the web."}

(AP)\n\nThe attacks that knocked South Korean banks and\nmedia outlets offline this week appear to be the latest examples of\ninternational \"cyberwar.\" But among the many ways that digital\nwarfare differs from conventional combat: There's often no good way of knowing\nwho's behind an attack.\n\nSouth Korean authorities said Thursday that the attack,\nwhich shut down scores of cash machines and hampered business, had been traced\nto an \"Internet Protocol\" address in China. But that doesn't mean the\nattack was launched from there. The general assumption in South Korea is that\nthe attack originated in North Korea.\n\n\"IP\" addresses are, roughly speaking, the phone\nnumbers of the Internet. Each connected computer has a number that identifies\nit uniquely on the network, so the Chinese IP address implies that a computer\nin China was involved in the attack.\n\nHowever, that computer could have been controlled from\nelsewhere, either because someone bought access to it, or because it's been\ninfected with malicious software. To determine the location from which it's\nbeing controlled, investigators would need access to that computer, or to the\nrecords of the company hosting the computer. That's unlikely to be forthcoming\nfrom a Chinese company.\n\n\"China is obviously a popular place to hide\nthings,\" said Dan Holden, director of security research at Arbor Networks'\nSecurity Engineering & Response Team. Chinese authorities are difficult to\nwork with and there's a language barrier, he said.\n\nIn addition, China is believed to be conducting its own\ncampaign of cyber-espionage, which means that attacks launched from there are\noften simply attributed to the Chinese government, even if it isn't responsible\nfor the aggression, Holden said.\n\n\"If you are any nation state or even any attacker right\nnow, why wouldn't you hide in China right now?\" Holden asked rhetorically.\n\nApart from tracing the path an attack takes through the\nInternet, there's another way to figure out who's behind it: analysis of the\nsoftware involved. Malicious software, or \"malware,\" can provide\nclues to its creator. Some of those are obvious, like comments inserted into\nthe written code. However, such comments can be easily faked to lead\ninvestigators astray. More subtle analysis can be fruitful, according to\nChristopher Novak, managing principal of the global investigative response team\nat Verizon Communications Inc.\n\n\"In many cases, the malware that you see on the\ncomputer is very similar to a cold or an illness that a person gets ... The\nstrain of the cold that I have and the strain of the cold that you have may be\nslightly different, but when we look at the DNA and makeup and see they're 99.9\npercent the same, there's a pretty good chance one of us transmitted it to the\nother,\" Novak said. \"When we analyze malware codes, we see the\nelements that are copied and reused, certain programming styles.\"\n\nSuch analysis can yield important clues, but rarely\nrock-solid attribution. The U.S. Department of Defense has said that a cyberattack\ncan merit a violent response, but first you have to know who to target.\n\n\"Digital attribution is extremely difficult and if you\nwant to do it, it takes some serious effort,\" Holden"}

{"text":"Communications corporate and AndA recent report from security firm Panda Labs found that in the last three months alone it has detected more than five million new types of malware. That works out to an average of one new type of Trojan, virus, and other malicious program discovered every 1.5 seconds.\n\nBecause of the way most anti-virus programs work, once a virus is discovered the anti-virus companies have to rush to write a piece of code or signature that must then be downloaded as quickly as possible by billions of users around the world in order to keep that particular piece of malware out.\n\nThat means that many of these viruses can easily make their way on to unprotected computers before the programmers have time to push out the updates. And with many anti-virus companies struggling to grow their profits, it could mean that as malware grows in volume and sophistication, anti-virus companies may have to spend less on updating their software.\n\nAnd if you don't believe in such perfect storms, take a close look at the identity theft wars. As identity theft continues to grow, and become more sophisticated, cash strapped police departments no longer have the resources to investigate these crimes. Which only encourages and emboldens more thieves.\n\nThe Panda Labs report seems to support this notion. The most powerful and dangerous type of malware, and the type most favored by organized crime for its ability to steal passwords and break into bank accounts, is the Trojan. And according to Panda three out of every 4 new types of malware discovered in the last three months was a Trojan.\n\nWhich probably explains why Trojans were responsible for the majority (63%) of infections in the last three months. Trojans are very efficient bank robbers, and the payoff can be enormous. Two cybercrooks from the Ukraine were just sent to prison in the United Kingdom after they were convicted of using exactly this type of malware to steal more than $4 million from bank accounts in just six months.\n\nOn a related note, the Panda Labs report also found that the countries with the worst infection rates were China, Taiwan, and Russia. In China, for example, it's believed that more than half of all PCs are infected by malware.\n\nAnd traditional attacks like phishing are not going away. Within days of a warning by the American Bankers Association of an unexplained spike in phishing attacks, security researchers had identified a new type of phishing attack that looks like it comes from a well-known bank and offering recipients $35 to complete an online survey.\n\nAccording to security firm Sophos, the email asked for so much highly confidential information it should be a warning sign. According to Sophos, the email questionnaire asked for:\n\nAnd an increasingly common way to spread phishing emails and infect users with this kind of malware is trusty old spam. The irony is that much of the spam in circulation today comes from the computers of innocent users. Spammers use botnets to infect unprotected computers and use them to relay spam to other users. And unfortunately, it appears that the United States still holds the top spot when it comes to relaying spam.\n\nThe bottom line? The easiest way to lose a battle is to just walk off the battlefield. As many companies and industries struggle just to survive, they're cutting back on security. According to this year's annual Global Information Security Survey, conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, nearly 10,000 executives around the world were asked about their plans to make security a priority. Sadly just 11% said that they planned to make data protection a top priority.\n\nCyber-crooks are taking full advantage. Not only are they developing even more sophisticated malware, they're deliberately overloading businesses and consumers with so many attacks, something has to give moment"}
{"text":"The person from Alabama allegedly is a member of Anonymous, a computer hacking group that took responsibility for a 2010 breach of PayPal in protest of the company's decision to not deliver funds to WikiLeaks.\n\nCyber crimes are becoming more and more common in our state and throughout the country. Because just about every company, bank, government entity and many people are connected to networks of computers, they are all susceptible to hacking. While this type of crime relates to federal laws that prohibit tampering with a company's computer systems, there are state laws in Alabama that relate to other types of cyber crimes.\n\nIdentity theft, credit card schemes, bank fraud, Ponzi schemes and other white collar crimes happen every day. And those defendants require an aggressive Birmingham Criminal Defense Lawyer who will stand up for them as the pressure of law enforcement, prosecutors and the state bear down.\n\nPayPal is a service that allows people to send and receive money to pay bills and make purchases. WikiLeaks is a web site that gets information about the government and private businesses and publishes it for all to see.\n\nIt famously released military documents, videos and other information to the entire world in recent years. PayPal last fall stopped allowing donations through its web site to WikiLeaks after the web site published classified cables from the U.S. Department of State. WikiLeaks said PayPal's actions \"tried to economically strangle WikiLeaks.\"\n\nIn response, the Anonymous group allegedly mounted denial of service attacks against PayPal's. These attacks are attempts to render computers unavailable to users through a variety of means, including saturating the target computers or networks with external communications requests, thereby denying service to legitimate users.\n\nFourteen people in Alabama and eight other states and the District of Columbia were arrested in connection with the attack. The suspects range in age from 20 to 42.\n\nIf you've been able to follow all the computer jargon, you can see how complex these cases can be. Prosecutors must have quite a bit of proof to show that a suspect committed these types of crimes. And proving that can be difficult. Without properly documented proof, the charges may be unprovable.\n\nMore common than these types of prosecutions are financially based crimes, such as credit card fraud and other forms of theft in Alabama. Most internet-based fraud crimes are charged in federal court because the alleged crimes cross state lines. And federal authorities not only have more resources and time to dedicate to crimes than local law enforcement, but they also have steep penalties.\n\nIf you are being investigated or are charged with a computer-related crime, don't speak with investigators. A statement can be used against you. Consult with an experienced Birmingham Criminal Defense Lawyer first."}

{"text":"taken the red pill that is a complete understanding of computer science.\n\nThe Black Hat organization gathers industry professionals for events that focus on technical security, and hosts meetings around the world. A recent event in Las Vegas brought out a few folks from iSec Partners, who demonstrated that they could unlock and start a Subaru Outback using their Android phone. By setting up their own GSM network, the pair from iSec grabbed authentication passwords by way of text messages. This gained them entry to the vehicle, and also allowed them to fire up the engine.\n\nThis security issue isn't a flaw related solely to the Outback either, as the duo from iSec explained how they could gain control over any device that is accessible via similar networks. Excuse us while we go wrap everything we own in tinfoil, including our heads.\n\nHold on a second. They set up their own gsm network and 'waited' until the owner sent a text message to the vehicle.. they didn't hack the car they hacked the phone by making it think it was on a legitimate network.\n\nThis is like blaming SMTP because you set up a fake wifi access point matching a real one and the user checked their email.\n\nThis isn't a story about hacking cars it's a story about using $10k GSM network equipment and allowing roaming, then waiting for text messages.\n\nNice. Don't you love how the media always spins the story, so that the ignorant public buy into it, even though the media, like AutoBlog, have no clue what they are talking about? But see, you get it. There is hope. What you describe is a MIM, or Man in the Middle attack. By the *hackers* setting up their own GSM network, it allowed the system in the vehicle to connect to the *hackers* GSM network, allowing them to intercept anything and everything. This is how just about all phishing scams through email work.\n\nIt's a joke of a story, and now those that don't have a clue about technology will be in fear.\n\nI like keyless entry because if you are juggling grocery bags and **** you can just open your door. Once you are seated in your car however I think that inserting a key in the ignition is not a hard step to take.\n\nHmm, I can't see how this would work unless the vehicle has some sort of aftermarket alarm\/remote start system with a cell phone integration piece. i.e. smartstart. Or an onstar type factory system. Subaru in particular doesn't offer an onstar like service nor smart key\/ push button start in the US. There's nothing in the new outback, software or hardware, that'll start the vehicle without turning the key in the ignition or adding a remote start to simulate the turning of the key.\n\n...and people call me old fashioned because I won't buy a new car without a key.\n\nthe key makes a positive mechanical connection. a push button start (or stop) is dependent on a computer hearing the request and processing it. if it doesn't hear the request (or chooses to ignore it), you're screwed.\n\nif you've ever heard the chilling tape of the CHP officer who died with his family in a Lexus in a 100+MPH fiery crash, it was evident that he was pushing the start\/stop button repeatedly, to no avail.\n\nIn a modern car the key is not any less electronic or more mechanical, it's just telling the computer to fire up the car and the keys themselves are chipped and coded to prevent people from just cutting a key-no chip, no starting up. Nothing is purely mechanical anymore and it's for the better. You should probably read your manual though to know how to turn off your car.\n\nI was going to vote you up but you lost me once you mentioned the Lexus incident. The officer was continuously pressing the start\/stop button but never bothered to press and hold it down till the engine shut off. Lexus and other automakers do this to unsure a rogue slip doesnt cause you to accidentally shut the car off while driving. Just had to mention that.\n\nThat's not necessarily true. My friend's 335i still lets you drive when the keys aren't in the car. It just doesn't allow you to start it. I think the security implementations are different for every manufacturer."}

{"text":"The malware, which is turning out to be a family of malware, has a specific purpose, to disable Industrial Control Systems. The latest variant appears to be focused on enabling access to systems that support ICS for the purpose of information gathering. The short lifespan of the malware probably means that there is a specific target, it monitors for 36 days and then removes itself. It takes a lot of time and resources to develop tools like this, so it points to a nation state as the likely author.\n\nIt's been over a year since the original Stuxnet was discovered and the author still hasn't been identified publicly. We may discover other variants over time, but never find out who is responsible.\n\nDuqu and Stuxnet have specific goals and have a lot of time and development effort behind them. It's not easy to defend against a determined attacker with unlimited resources. Defense in depth is a relative easy way to try and defend against these types of threats. You may not be able to stop them, but with a mix of tools you could be alerted to odd behavior before too much information was leaked. For example, using a web proxy allows control over what websites users can access. A firewall and IPS can block attacks in real time based on blacklists and signatures. Two factor authentication is more difficult to compromise than passwords alone. Once public, malware like Duqu will be in all the major antivirus signature databases. Using all of these elements together increases the likelihood of catching malicious activity quickly.\n\nAdditionally, there are several companies that sell data feeds that provide real-time lists of known bad hosts and domains. These lists can be used to compare to active network connections through a firewall or proxy server and alert analysts and system administrators to potential data exfiltration. A common example is known botnet Command and Control servers, corporate hosts should never contact these bonnet CC's so any connection would be suspect. ScoutVision solves part of this by allowing users to take multiple data feeds, combine them, and quickly identify what impact those threats might have. It helps provide visibility into a variety of large data sets, that would normally require manual analysis."}

{"text":"Experts see nation-state behind sophisticated computer virus attack\n\nByIAN ALLEN| intelNews.org |\nComputer forensics specialists are split as to the purpose and initial target of a sophisticated computer virus that infected computers used in the Iranian government's nuclear energy program. The virus, named Stuxnet, was discovered in Iran in June by a Belarusian computer security firm doing business in the Islamic Republic. It has since infected at least 100,000 computer systems in countries such as Brazil, India, Russia and the United States. But the primary target of the virus appears to have been the Iranian nuclear energy program, specifically computers located at the Islamic Republic's nuclear reactor facility in Bushehr and the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz. Several commentators, including Wired magazine, dispute the existence of any evidence pointing to a clear target inside Iran. But Israeli media maintain that computers at Natanz were the primary target of Stuxnet, and that subsequent infections at computer labs at Bushehr were in fact an unintended side effect. Putting aside differences regarding the primary target of the virus, most experts agree that the complexity and sophistication of Stuxnet's code point to the sort of programming resources that would normally be available only to \"a well-resourced nation-state\". Israel's Ha'aretz daily identifies Unit 8200 of the Israeli Military Intelligence, or the Mossad, as chief suspects behind Stuxnet. The latter appears specifically designed to sabotage sensitive hardware components found specifically in centrifuges. In the summer of 2009, the Reuters news agency revealed the existence of a covert Israeli cyberwarfare scheme directed against the Iranian nuclear energy program"}
{"text":"A Flashback trojan that affected over 600,000 OS X machines with relative ease, earlier this month, exposed gaping holes in the OS X software architecture and got industry experts discussing how competent Apple is at dealing with the threat of malware, on its end. Eugene Kaspersky, CEO and co-founder of security company Kaspersky Lab, believes that Apple is \"10 years behind Microsoft in terms of security,\" and the ease with which scores of OS X machines could be compromised by malware in the recent times formed the basis of his assertion.\n\n\",\" Kaspersky commented. Increase in malware and cybercrime against OS X machines, according to him are \"just a question of time and market share. Cyber criminals have now recognised that Mac is an interesting area. Now we have more, it's not just Flashback or Flashfake. Welcome to Microsoft's world, Mac. It's full of malware.\"\n\nFollowing this article, which was written a few weeks ago, some more news have come in regarding this\n\nWeeks after security mogul Eugene Kaspersky opined that Apple is \"10 years behind Microsoft on security,\" Kaspersky Lab revealed that it is collaborating with Apple to investigate security concerns (read: vulnerabilities) of its operating systems, and improve its security. Kaspersky Lab CTO Nikolai Grebennikov in an interview with Computing.co.uk was quoted saying \"Apple recently invited us to improve its security.\"\n\nKaspersky Lab maintains that Apple's software is extremely vulnerable, going as far as to claim that Apple doesn't pay enough attention to security. \"Our first investigations show Apple doesn't pay enough attention to security. For example, Oracle closed a vulnerability in Java, which was a target for a major botnet several months ago,\" said Grebennikov. Apple's decision to handle updates of Java runtime environment for OS X by itself, breaking away from Oracle's update cycle, particularly drew flack from Grebennikov. \"Apple blocked Oracle from updating Java on Mac OS, and they perform all the udpates themselves. They only released the patch a few weeks ago \u2013 two or three months after the Oracle patch. That's far too long,\" he said. Kaspersky isn't too optimistic about the infinitely more popular iOS platform, either. \"Our experience tells us that in the near future, perhaps in a year or so, we will see the first malware targeting iOS,\" it commented.\n\nThis post has been edited by nobody813: May 15 2012, 08:57 AM\n\n--------------------\n\n\"If the forums were just Opy talking about World of Tanks, I'd... okay, maybe not.\" - hawkeyeI always take these reports with a grain of salt. These people are only interested in one thing, pushing their product. They also claim Android has malware. Unless you personally ok it to install, there's no way for malware to do anything.Interestingly only talking about malware. The as-predicted mac viruses have yet to materialise.\n\nUm. What?\n\nThe Flashback trojan is the main focus of the articles? It's a virus?\n\nYou also seem to be suggesting that viruses are still rife on PCs and malware isn't pretty much the only game in town now.\n\nAs pointed out, software that asks you to give it administration access in order to install, isn't a virus. A virus installs itself, and can transmit to further machines. Malware is much more prevalent, however on windows there are still a lot of systems using out of date browsers with out of date default settings, that can be exploited to create a self-installing malware on your computer. Which to my mind satisfies criteria A. Suffice to say, it's more of an issue than on Apple.\n\nBut in either case, how is Apple 10 years behind? Windows does a lot of tricks to move libraries around in memory, which is nice, but mainly done because hacking windows memory addresses was just too easy in a way it's not been since mac was on classic OS. Apple doesn't do that, but then they are moving a long way into sandboxing, faster than windows. Unfortunately, along with any security changes, there are issues.\n\nIf you focus only on security, you compromise on features. Forcing full sandboxing, makes it hard to link up applications.\n\nUltimately, the end user needs to take responsability. They need to know what they are doing when they type in the admin password. You can't code an OS to stop a moron doing moronic things. Not while being user friendly, and not scaring away the tech savvy.\n\nApple are moving towards signing packages, and giving the OS options to not allow any installs apart from app store apps, and signed apps. It's entirely benign and security related (and not mandatory) but it doesn't stop the haters hating.\n\nEven then, there's heaps of \"not quite malware, but not really legit\" things like mackeeper, or kaspersky, where they'll sign okay (because they'll pay apple, and it's not a virus) but the net result is a subscription costing you $$ per annum while doing not much. Likewise, facebook app on iOS is what I would consider malware. Only problem is, if your friends install it, it effects you too.\n\nMalware might be the new virus, but the new malware isn't made by hackers. It's made by entrepreneurs.\n\nQUOTE (fliptopia @ Sep 3 2012, 06:58 AM)Absolutely.\n\n+1 to this as well.\n\nThe computer was desgined to get work done and to most people a computer, be it a PC or a Mac, is just a tool to help them at work. The IT department is there to hold their hand. The same goes for home users. In their case as long as the antivirus says \"Your computer is protected\" they believe that everything is all good. Those that run Mac just think they are safe.\n\nThere is a reason why forums are overfowing with threads like: \"I have an antivirus, it's updated, how did i get a virus? I thought <insert AV software name here> was good....?\"\n\nPersonally i just feel that so many people forget that it's their passion for computing that makes it easy.

They are relatively rare, unseen events, that make the news only when something goes horribly wrong.\n\nFalse positives, or the act of marking legitimate content as being malicious, are an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of rapid response security technologies. They are relatively rare, unseen events, that make the news only when something goes horribly wrong.\nSecurity filters in both the real world and in the electronic world all work on pretty much the same principles. The computer security filters look for the presence of a set of \"features\", such as a set of binary strings or the libraries used by a given program, while real world security filters look for weapons in carry-on bags or other suspicious activities.\n\nBoth types of systems have error rates that are defined, measured, and hopefully reduced. Type I errors, or false positives, are mistakes where something is marked malicious when it is really clean, while Type II errors, or false negatives, are mistakes where malicious content is marked legitimate. Type I errors consists of legitimate mail going to your spam folder or travelers being told they can't fly due to their name being on a secret list. Type II errors consists of viruses that infect machines that are already running anti-virus and guys who smuggle shoe-bombs onto airliners.\n\nAcceptable numbers for false positive and false negative errors depend on the relative cost of an error and when the last error occurred. As a society we tolerate relatively high false positive error rates as long as false negative errors are zero for the screening of potential terrorists, while we don't tolerate false negative errors at all for desktop anti-virus, as it would affect legitimate software.\n\nAs errors fade into memory, our risk tolerance changes. Today, we are far less tolerance of false positives in anti-virus systems, as not too many people remember the days of when the Michelangelo virus would nuke a chunk of the hard drive on a given day. American citizens are also less tolerant of false positives when it comes to finding terrorists, as the current political climate has clearly shown.\n\nAll of you are aware that Google had a brief false positive issue on Saturday morning that was rapidly remedied. Their technology is important for providing the average user with a first-line filter for removing web-borne threats. I hope that people will continue to trust it, even with their small increase in false positive rate.\n\nRE: The psychological impact of false positives\n\nWell, if your car alarms goes off randomly, do you get rid of the alarm? Not\nreally, there are too many benefits. I think, in my view, the principle is\nthe same. People are used to \"false positives\", yes a certain amount of\ncompliance from the security control crying wolf will, for most people, make\nthem more complacent, as the \"feeling part of the brain\" might decided not\nallow the \"thinking\" part of the brain the effort or interest.\n\nTypo in Definitions - NOT\n\nHere's the actual quote.

{"text":"September 12, 2012\n\nThere are two classic books describing hackers active in the 1980s who did have incredible talent. Talents that made them dangerous enough to be considered criminal threats.\n\nCuckoo is arguably the first case of hacking that was a clearly malicious crime circa 1986, and certainly the first known case of computer hacking as international espionage. I read this when it was originally published in 1989, and it's still a gripping investigative story. Cliff Stoll is a visionary writer who saw how trust in computers and the emerging Internet could be vulnerable to real, actual, honest-to-God criminals.\n\nI'm not sure Kevin Mitnick did anything all that illegal, but there's no denying that he was the world's first high profile computer criminal.\n\nThe whole story is told in minute detail by Kevin himself in Ghost in the Wires. There was a sanitized version of Kevin's story presented in Wizzywig comix but this is the original directly from the source, and it's well worth reading. I could barely put it down. Kevin has been fully reformed for many years now; he wrote several books documenting his techniques and now consults with companies to help improve their computer security.\n\nThese two books cover the genesis of all computer crime as we know it. Of course it's a much bigger problem now than it was in 1985, if for no other reason than there are far more computers far more interconnected with each other today than anyone could have possibly imagined in those early days. But what's really surprising is how little has changed in the techniques of computer crime since 1985.\n\nThe best primer of modern \u2013 and by that I mean year 2000 and later \u2013 computer crime is Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime Underground. Modern computer crime is more like the classic sort of crime you've seen in black and white movies: it's mostly about stealing large sums of money. But instead of busting it out of bank vaults Bonnie and Clyde style, it's now done electronically, mostly through ATM and credit card exploits.\n\nWritten by Kevin Poulson, another famous reformed hacker, Kingpin is also a compelling read. I've read it twice now. The passage I found most revealing is this one, written after the protagonist's release from prison in 2002:\n\nOne of Max's former clients in Silicon Valley tried to help by giving Max a $5,000 contract to perform a penetration test on the company's network. The company liked Max and didn't really care if he produced a report, but the hacker took the gig seriously. He bashed at the company's firewalls for months, expecting one of the easy victories to which he'd grown accustomed as a white hat. But he was in for a surprise. The state of corporate security had improved while he was in the joint. He couldn't make a dent in the network of his only client. His 100 percent success record was cracking.\n\nMax pushed harder, only becoming more frustrated over his powerlessness. Finally, he tried something new. Instead of looking for vulnerabilities in the company's hardened servers, he targeted some of the employees individually.\n\nThese \"client side\" attacks are what most people experience of hackers\u2014a spam e-mail arrives in your in-box, with a link to what purports to be an electronic greeting card or a funny picture. The download is actually an executable program, and if you ignore the warning message\n\nAll true; no hacker today would bother with frontal assaults. The chance of success is miniscule. Instead, they target the soft, creamy underbelly of all companies: the users inside. Max, the hacker described in Kingpin, bragged \"I've been confident of my 100 percent [success] rate ever since.\" This is the new face of hacking. Or is it?\n\nOne of the most striking things about Ghost In The Wires is not how skilled a computer hacker Kevin Mitnick is (although he is undeniably great), but how devastatingly effective he is at tricking people into revealing critical information in casual conversations. Over and over again, in hundreds of subtle and clever ways. Whether it's 1985 or 2005, the amount of military-grade security you have on your computer systems matters not at all when someone using those computers clicks on the dancing bunny. Social engineering is the most reliable and evergreen hacking technique ever devised. It will outlive us all. and then reset it to do the damage to my devices.\n\nI heard about this on Twitter when the story was originally developing, and my initial reaction was skepticism that anyone had bothered to brute force anything at all, since brute forcing is for dummies. Guess what it turned out to be. Go ahead, guess!\n\nAfter coming across my [Twitter] account, the hackers did some background research. My Twitter account linked to my personal website, where they found my Gmail address. Guessing that this was also the e-mail address I used for Twitter, Phobia went to Google's account recovery page. He didn't even have to actually attempt a recovery. This was just a recon mission.\n\nBecause I didn't have Google's two-factor authentication turned on, when Phobia entered my Gmail address, he could view the alternate e-mail I had set up for account recovery. Google partially obscures that information, starring out many characters, but there were enough characters available, m\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022n@me.com. Jackpot.\n\nSince he already had the e-mail, all he needed was my billing address and the last four digits of my credit card number to have Apple's tech support issue him the keys to my account.\n\nSo how did he get this vital information? He began with the easy one. He got the billing address by doing a whois search on my personal web domain. If someone doesn't have a domain, you can also look up his or her information on Spokeo, WhitePages, and PeopleSmart.\n\nGetting a credit card number is tricker, but it also relies on taking advantage of a company's back-end systems. \u2026\n\nPhobia, the hacker Mat Honan documents, was a minor who did this for laughs. One of his friends is a 15 year old hacker who goes by the name of Cosmo; he's the one who discovered the Amazon credit card technique described above. And what are teenage hackers up to these days?\n\nXbox gamers know each other by their gamertags. And among young gamers it's a lot cooler to have a simple gamertag like \"Fred\" than, say, \"Fred1988Ohio.\" Before Microsoft beefed up its security, getting a password-reset form on Windows Live (and thus hijacking a gamer tag) required only the name on the account and the last four digits and expiration date of the credit card on file. Derek discovered that the person who owned the \"Cosmo\" gamer tag also had a Netflix account. And that's how he became Cosmo.\n\n\"I called Netflix and it was so easy,\" he chuckles. \"They said, 'What's your name?' and I said, 'Todd [Redacted],' gave them his e-mail, and they said, 'Alright your password is 12345,' and I was signed in. I saw the last four digits of his credit card. That's when I filled out the Windows Live password-reset form, which just required the first name and last name of the credit card holder, the last four digits, and the expiration date.\"\n\nThis method still works. When Wired called Netflix, all we had to provide was the name and e-mail address on the account, and we were given the same password reset.\n\nThe techniques are eerily similar. The only difference between Cosmo and Kevin Mitnick is that they were born in different decades. Computer crime is a whole new world now, but the techniques used today are almost identical to those used in the 1980s. If you want to engage in computer crime, don't waste your time developing ninja level hacking skills, because computers are not the weak point.\n\nPeople areSome people might think that the lesson of Mat Honan's story is give your phone number to Google, so that hackers don't get to learn your other email. Problem is Google(or any other service provider for that matter) shouldn't be displaying any part of your recovery info for any reason.\n\nWhat would you think, if your password reminder question was like this:\nYour favorite dog?\nL*ss**\n\nAnd kudos to Apple and Amazon for using publicly accessible information as part of their id confirmation questions.\n\nI am sorry but I'm failing to see how this was a \"people\" error and not a \"system\" error.\n\nPassword recovery is kind of a paradoxical thing. From a technical point of view it would be easy to say \"this account has password X, do not let anyone in unless he knows X\", but the objective of authentication is not to verify that you know the password, it's to verify that you are who you say you are, and passwords are forgotten and stolen regularly, so they are ultimately something that's defeated by its own objective. Reminds me a bit of DRM, which wants to prevent people from copying things wile letting them access them.\n\nMaybe Google should have a \"disable all password recovery options\" mode for paranoid people who think they can handle that?\n\n@James: \".\"\n\nThe distinction is between how the system functions and prevents intrusion on its own, versus actions that people take that unwittingly give hackers access.\n\nIn this example, the system was designed in a vulnerable way. An attack like that is made possible because a hacker can make a frontline assault on the system instead of calling a customer service person or sending the user an email bomb to open.\n\nI just finished \"Ghost in the Wires\" it was an amazing book. Reading it confirmed that the weakest link in any security system is the people who use it. The fact remains that 100% security will never be the attainable, simply because of the inherent \"trust\" we as humans have for each other.\n\nMaybe the companies need to ask for the second to last 4 digits of a credit card. most companies display the last 4, but if the customer service would ask for the second to last 4, this would not be visible. The back end systems could be set to only display this information to the customer service individuals. Still making it secure for the user. It would be similar to a private key that only the user and company would know.\n\nWe are willing to sacrifice security for convenience to be able to do business over the phone easily. Some of the glaring weaknesses that are common in the US, such as using social security numbers, dates of birth, mother's maiden name, or last four digits of credit card as a form of \"identification\", are rare in other countries where business over the phone is not as common or businesses are more paranoid.\n\nIn Mexico, if you want to do almost anything related to your bank\/utility\/government\/etc. account, you have to go to a branch in person and bring photo ID. Sure, you might fake a photo ID, but that increases the barrier and risk greatly compared to fraud over the phone.\n\n(On the other hand, many people in Mexico are victims of bank fraud that are perpetrated by bank insiders, so things are most definitely not perfect there either!)\n\nSecurity is never perfect and people are the weakest link by the very fact they are people. The same can be said for lots of things. What's the ratio of auto accidents caused by mechanical failure versus driver error? Pretty low I would guess.\n\nYou also have to factor in that there is little value in making it hard for customers to access your services and buy products. How attractive is a store with steel doors and no windows where you have to show ID and answer personal questions?\n\nCuckoo's Egg is one of my favourite books, although I'm not sure I'd describe that hacker as 'incredibly talented', just very persistent.\n\nI think you're missing a big chunk of the picture of the early days by focusing on just the two books mentioned however. I'd recommend this book as a worthy third in the list:  -- I have a print copy, but the full text can be downloaded from that website.\n\nThe book includes the stories of several hackers from Europe, the US and Australia, although it doesn't provide their real names (several can be found on Wikipedia now though).\n\nBTW, I can definitely recommend you *don't* read Tsutomu Shimomura's, \"Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of Kevin Mitnick\". For some reason he felt compelled to detail his eating habits along the way, and it's hugely distracting@Andyj75: credit card companies do not want retailers to display or store any other digits than the last 4, the last 4 digits are considered OK, they're shown on most receipts etc. The PCI requirements have a lot of very strict rules about how all credit card data must be stored or the retailer risks having their merchant accounts closed. Many retailers like Amazon do store the full details but they do have to follow the strict rules which almost certainly would prohibit sharing them for this kind of verification.\n\nThe scary thing about the attach on Mat Honan's accounts was the multiple front attack, they got Amazon, Google and Apple. All three had some set of *almost* reasonable practises but the slight variance between allowed the compromise of one account to lead to the next.\n\nThis isn't a \"people\" problem or a \"system\" problem, it sounds like a process problem. I remember one company claiming that their practises weren't followed but that is a process problem, not a people problem if it's as frequent as it seems.\n\nIt's good to finally have had another blog post after a month, I guess it was the jury duty or something from the look of Twitter? A series of posts about hacking would be interesting.\n\nThe other day I called some company. Phone company maybe. They asked for my secret 4 digit code. I have had the account for at least a decade and don't recall any sort of 4 digit code ever being asked for. So I guessed the last four of my SSN and they said that wasn't it. So they tried asking some more things and decided to help me. They came up with a new 4 digit code that I'm supposed to know somewhere in the last 10 years.\n\nThey decided recently to start asking for it if you call in. But all the old customers, like me, don't know what they are talking about. The customer support folks want to help us so they go around the security rules to convince themselves that the person claiming to be me on the phone is really me.\n\nThe 4 digit code has accomplished nothing.\n\nThis way of doing things just makes it that much easier for the bad guy (or girl to be fair) to social engineer their way into my phone account. (I do hope they pay it if they hack in, though.)\n\nMy bank always does security authentication things through snail mail. I always wondered if that really helped the situation, or if it's just that the crackers don't have the patience to wait that long, so they get bored and move on.\n\nThat day I give some companies. The telephone company may. They. cheap football jerseys\n\nI assumed anyone applying for a job as a programmer had already crossed this chasm. Apparently this is not a reasonable assumption to make. Apparently, FizzBuzz style screening is required to keep interviewers from wasting their time interviewing programmers who can't program. P\u00e1ginas Amarillas\n\nThey free credit reports\n\nI hope one day one of your kids gets told that they shouldn't do something, because they'll probably suck at it. Then you'll get an idea how hard it can be to pull someone out of that hole. NYC Tax Preparation"}

It has some very specific features that target nuclear reactor, specifically centrifuges that spin nuclear material at Iran's enrichment facilities. Viruses like Stuxnet aren't just fabricated in basements by angry, malevolent computer nerds - hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of data, meticulous research, and even knowledge of very classified internal systems all go into the development.\n\nOn top of that, viruses like Stuxnet can be available for anybody to find and toy with - it could be retooled for other malicious purposes.

{"text":"A Canadian tech magazine with the inside scoop. Info on everything from TVs, to digital cameras, cell phones, and MP3 players.\n\nThursday, February 28, 2008\n\nConcert Tickets Allegedly Being Swiped by Hackers\n\nAnyone who has ever tried to get tickets for a highly anticipated concert or sporting event knows that it's next to impossible. You visit TicketMaster only to find out that the tickets are sold out within minutes of being on sale; or that the only ones left are \"obstructed view\". The sad truth is that unless you know someone who knows someone, it's pretty darned difficult to get event tickets at all. But is this because they really, legitimately sell out to regular fans?\n\nMy guess, and the results of a recent CBC investigation, think not. At any event venue, you'll likely find loads of guys screaming at the top of their lungs that they have tickets...albeit at a severely inflated price. You might also hear stories about someone who managed to get tickets online at, once again, severely inflated pricing. How do these people get tickets? And, more important, how do they manage to do so before a real fan even has the chance? CBC's investigation into the issue revealed some very interesting results that led back to a new breed of computer hackers.\n\nAccording to the study, hackers have discovered a way to bypass entering that weird four or five character \"confirmation\" code that proves you're a human person and not a spam program. In doing so, they're able to robotically purchase hundreds and hundreds of tickets before a regular fan can even load the site's homepage! What do they do with all these tickets? Sell them to \"scalpers\" or third-party ticket selling sites, of course, who in turn jack up the pricing, and put parents in debt just to take their kids to see Hannah Montana.\n\nShould mom or dad really have to pay $1,000 for a pair or tickets to a \"tween\" show; or should a die-hard hockey fan have to pay three-times the price of a ticket because he can't get tickets from TicketMaster? There's no question that it's just not fair.\n\nWho should take responsibility for cleaning up this issue in Canada? Should it fall on Ticketmaster, which is argubly the largest ticket seller in the country? Law enforcement? The promoters or event producers?\n\nEven beyond the illegal or \"shady\" resellers, it just doesn't make sense that a major fan can't get a concert ticket, yet a local radio station is giving away tickets every hour on the hour. Isn't the whole point of an event to cater to the tried and true fans, and not the people with the deepest pockets and lucky dialing fingers?\n\nOne could argue that a \"real\" fan would be willing to fork over three-times the price for a ticket anyway. But shouldn't he at least have a fair shot at purchasing the tickets at the regular price first? Absolutely. Hopefully CBC's investigation will shed some well-needed light on this ongoing issue.\n\nAlthough your idea sounds great, I'll bet that these guys have really advanced systems that would allow them to make 10 purchases of 10 tickets each using 10 different credit card numbers faster than one of us could pick up a phone and dial a number to order them.\n\nPerhaps the only way would be to restrict ticket sales to pick-up and purchase in person only. Wouldn't that be funny if we moved backward from automating processes to dealing with a human again for the sake of security!"}

{"text":"There are only 10 kinds of people:\nThose who understand binary\nand those who don't!\n\nPosted 03 November 2003 - 06:18 PM\n\nI wished to revisit this subject in a civilized and direct manner; as I am curious as to the input of individuals on these forums. Dollars... yen... pounds... euros... whatever currency you trade in, hackers cost millions, perhaps even billions, per year. Today's high-tech buisness market relies on the speed with which computers and the internet allow the transfer of data. Perhaps they rely on it too much, as they find out \"WHEN HACKERS ATTACK\" (sorry, couldn't resist ) and they have no way in which to conduct thier buiness. To a corporation as large as Microsoft of McDonalds, or even Amazon or Ebay, a single day on the down can mean several million dollars of lost profits (especially for those that operate solely online)... multiply that by the number of corporations affected, and the results can be tremendous! As a programmer, I speak with \"wanna-be\" hackers on a daily basis... but not a one of them I know would venture to truly cause destruction... As a matter of fact, none have ever mentioned of truly hacking into any system, personal or otherwise. Most hackers are more interested in learning about the systems, wether it be in the hopes of creating a empire of thier own or simply by creating a system for thier own personal enjoyment. Saying that malicious hacking is a product of boredom is like saying that murder is a product of malnutrition. Bad parenting, shady morals, or good, ol' fashioned destructive tendancies are the causes of malicious hacking. There are plenty of other challenges that the PC presents. If you are a board young prodigy, try creating the next hit PC game... or maybe put Microsoft out to pasture with a superior OS or a wonderful and affordable office suite. Sure... these are VERY lofty ambitions... and that's the point, these are much higher and more fulfilling ambitions than hacking into Ebay and changing every other word of text to \"boob.\" Don't want to set your sites so high? You skills could always allow you to make a nice bit of extra cash setting up wireless networks for private individuals and small buisnesses; or spend your day creating groovy flash animations for NewGrounds. Not that ambitious? Well, you probably shouldn't try hacking anyway... but if you still need a deterrant; why don't you just spend all day creating \"nude patches\" for GTA or Tomb Raider? Not that tech saavy? There's ALWAYS porn and message boards... take your pick, I prefer the latter. My point is; there are lots of equally entertaining, accessible, and profitable diversions other than malicious hacking. Destructive hacking is brought on by the same teenage angst that causes vandalism and non-social drug and alchohol abuse... it is a lack of parenting and good social exposure that leaves teens without a proper outlet for thier frustrations. Parents spend too much time worrying about Johnny's grades and NOT enough time worrying about Johnny's emotional state. They never tried to teach Johnny what to do when his girlfriend says \"so long\", what to do when the world throws you a curveball. Parents... TEACH YOUR CHILDREN HOW TO CONSTRUCTIVELY DEAL WITH THIER ANGER AND FRUSTRATION! It will allow your children to live happier, healthier, and more successful lives as well as cause you ALOT less trouble in the long run!\n\n***************************************************\nThe Saxfiend (AKA \"SaxCatz\")\nsaxcatz@hotmail.com\nSaxophonist and Software Engineer (AKA \"Code Jockey\") \"What do you mean IF these walls could talk?\"\n***************************************************\n\nEveryone likes a smouldering and sexy glare from a diminutive scientist.\n\nPosted 03 November 2003 - 08:47 PM\n\nWell, I'd give my opinion again\u2026but I'm pretty sure it's been pretty well documented So I'll just reiterate that I think hackers are scum, who shouldn't be allowed to have a computer, let alone the internet, and leave it at that.\n\nShould they be punished? Yes, next question.\n\nIf you want the full argument\u2026and I do mean 'argument'\u2026then it's all in the other thread.\n\nApparantly, over on Exchristian.Net, they say that I'm \"probably the smartest person\" on UM....that is so cool...\n\nSo the point you're making is that hackers shouldn't waste their brains on topics like computer security but work on motivating projects like for example a word processor or something like excel. Put yourself in the head of the teenager, or remember when you were one, what was the thing that excites all teenagers ? If I remember well, it's being cool, a concept that people generally loose when they grow up. But for teenagers, writing a text processor is not \"cool\", hacking in a computer is cool. Listening to Mozart is not cool, listening to the latest rap hit is cool. So basically teenagers and adult live in two different worlds, conceptions are completely different.\n\nTo the question: should they be punished. Of course yes but in proportion to the consequences of their acts and their age. I can hardly imagine to hold a kid responsible on the same level as an adult because by nature kids are not as reponsible as adults (otherwise we would let them drive cars at 10 ).\n\nIt's always the same question and internet and hackers are just one side of it. For example if a 12 years old kid shots another one with his father gun, who is guilty ? The kid for stealing the gun and using it ? The father for not securing the access to the gun enough ? The society that lets people have guns so easily ?\n\nIn computers it's similar. Who is responsible for the loss of money ? The kid for hacking a server ? The server owner for not taking sufficient measures for protecting its server ? The parents for not monitoring their kid ?\n\nIn both cases, I feel that the kid isn't responsible because he doesn't have the maturity to be responsible. But then who is responsible ?To expand on it it's like a kids killing his brothers and sisters in cold blood then whoever claiming he was misunderstood...He should fry nomatterwhat.\n\nRavens KeepA forum for Classic D&D, AD&D and the upcoming Castles and Crusades.\n\nSoon it's over, all the dwarfs defeated\nThe silence of the caverns stand still\nOrcs took the command of the caves and depths\nThe darklord has reached his will ---Battlelore\n\nFill my mug, I just want to forget\nAll the troubles and fighting\nAnd the ghosts in my head --Battlelore\n\nI'm Simply repeating what I said in the last thread about this subject, here goes, lol.\n\nThe other day a hacker was acquitted because his lawyer claimed a Trojan Virus was placed onto his clients computer by ANOTHER hacker. But even though the law can prove where the hack was preformed from, they cannot prove who was sat at the keyboard at the time, or whether it was in fact caused by another hacker hacking the hackers computer (confusing I know, lol) So this has set a new president. Now hackers have a legal loophole with which to escape punishment for something they have done.\n\nAbout the Trojan Horse: Imagine a hacker sets up a Trojan Horse in your computers and hacks into many places using your computer as a getaway. Now imagine that the FBI traces the attacks back to your computer. Then you'll be happy to find an attorney to defend yourself and explain that it wasn't your fault. See it's not because people are charged that they're guilty, that's why there are courts of law.\n\nAbout kids not being responsible: What I'm saying is that they can't be held responsible on the same level as adults, that is the punishment must be much lighter.\n\nTalking about responsability, if someone with a mental handicap murders someone else, what should be his sentence ? Electric chair or mental hospital ? I would say mental hospital if he's not fully aware of his doings, the punishment only makes if the person understands he did something wrong. And I think it's good that the law generally agrees with that in evolved countries (ok may be perhaps excepted in Texas from what I've heared but well I'm not going to comment on Texas).\n\nEveryone likes a smouldering and sexy glare from a diminutive scientist.\n\nPosted 04 November 2003 - 09:15 AM\n\nIs this the correct time to point out that children are not insane? Nor, for that matter, are they stupid...which is what the opinion that 'they're not responsible', levied by extremely patronising adults, manages very well to imply.\n\nThe kids who are actually out there hacking (most of the ones I've encountered range from 15-19) are quite able to understand the concept of right and wrong, and are also able to understand that people are being hurt as a result of their actions...they simply don't care. What age do you think the people making all these killer viruses are, seven!?\n\nApparantly, over on Exchristian.Net, they say that I'm \"probably the smartest person\" on UM....that is so cool...\n\nAbout kids not being responsible: What I'm saying is that they can't be held responsible on the same level as adults, that is the punishment must be much lighter.\n\nSo, these 'young' kids, who have the ability to bypass complicated multitasking computer software that protects programs from military installations to oil companies and banks (just to name a few). You believe they have the ability and intelligence to get around military encrypted programs, and insert their own, which causes devastation, that these, amazingly gifted young ninos, shouldn't be prosecuted along with adults, when as its stated they are of legal age to be prosecuted? Well I for one am 30 and know my way around almost any computer, but I haven't the ability to comprehended how to bypass complicated programs. I think you not giving these 'children' enough credit for the abilities and intelligence they hold, and have the power to cause alot of trouble, considering almost everything is patched through computers. I wonder if you will feel the same way after one of these precious little 'children' hack into the bank where your money is 'safely' held, and wipes your banking details of the computer. Or puts your address onto a dept collecting agencies computer, and have you furniture removed in front of all your neighbours. Or puts a tag on your car, and the police pull you over for unpaid tickets (which have all been done by hackers). Lets see you smile and pat the wonderful little ninos on the head after you have personally been a victim of them! If they have the intelligence to commit the crime, then they should be treated with the same manner as one would treat any other crime. (Don't get me wrong, this sort of crime is pure adrenaline junkies, that know exactly what they are doing,) not all crime is so black and white as this!\n\nit's funny you ask me this question because I asked it to myself before posting my mail. I would be really pissed off if such a situation happened to me but I would stick to my principles, lighter punishment than for an adult (which doesn't mean no punishment). Being skilled and knowledgeable doesn't mean that you have the maturity to go along with it. I'm saying that about kids and suddenly I realize that it would apply perfectly well to military and their powerful weapons too. But well I guess it's easier for people to focus on a kid than on a powerful institution...\n\nKryso? I applaud your efforts....... However? I think you're beating your head against a wall.\n\nOne of the comments I found interesting in this thread was a reference to \"anti-virus\" Companies....... Those who produce the Software to fight the digusting, never-ending battle against this crud that has invaded the Internet...... would have nothing to produce, if \"hackers\" ceased their dirty work.\n\nAgain you use hacker as a generic term, Say that in 1 million hackers and cracker 5 are stupid enough to get caught, the public starts to get annoyed with computer savvy people, it doesn't matter whether they are good or bad they still get a blasting, The hackers gets pissed off because they spend all of their free time making YOU safe, from the crackers. The hackers are what make your firewalls, your antivirus software, your trojan horse detecters, they fix bugs in your software, so that crackers can't get the handhold, while they are busy making YOU safe, they are getting flamed but millions of user worldwide becuase of crackers who are intent on harming, do they get credit? NO. How about giving the hackers that do a good job in keeping YOU safe a round of applause for their efforts? I'm not saying praise the crackers, but praise hackers that do good, they are like the \"police\" force of the internet, but go relatively unnoticed by normal users. I myself find it frustrating everytime i mention myself as a hacker, to be blasted left right and centre because of something else someone else is doing. Don't hate the many because of a few.

{"text":"RELATED TOPICS\n\nAs businesses continue to move critical operations online, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and range of targets.\n\nIn a 2011 Verisign study, 63 per cent of respondents reported experiencing at least one attack that year, while 51 per cent reported revenue loss as a result of downtime from the attack. Those numbers are undoubtedly higher today as the size, frequency and complexity of DDoS attacks continue to grow.\n\nMitigation against these types of attacks is challenging and generally requires layered solutions across data centers and the cloud in order to manage. The success of these attacks and their ability to damage a company's infrastructure, revenue and reputation is indicative that many IT managers still haven't found the right protection formula to proactively mitigate them.\n\nA DDoS attack occurs when a botnet is used to send an overwhelming amount of bad traffic to an intended target, such as a company's website. Let's use an e-commerce site for example: nearly every e-commerce site has an 'Add to Cart' button. If a DDoS attacker could script a thousand bots (some botnets have over a million bots) to simulate clicking on that 'Add to Cart' button and generate more traffic than the site could handle, legitimate shoppers would have no chance of getting their click in.\n\nThe key to fighting a complex attack like this is being able to differentiate a real shopper from a bot so the website can service one and ignore the other.\n\nWith the ease of access to the internet and prevalence of social media today, unsuspecting computer users are making it easier than ever for malicious actors to target them with malcode. This trend has helped provide the perfect environment for DDoS attacks to grow both in size and complexity. In fact, attacks of 100 Gigabits per second (Gbps) have been recorded.\n\nTo put that into context, the largest recorded DDoS attack was 2Gbps in 2002. Considering that most websites have less than 1Gbps of network bandwidth, even small attacks today can quickly prove devastating.\n\nIn addition it's not just web infrastructure the attackers are targeting, but increasingly the Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure as well. Arbor Networks' 2012 Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report indicated that 41 per cent of respondents experienced DDoS attacks against their DNS infrastructure.\n\nWe've seen this with several recent attacks against financial institutions and others that used new malicious code to attack the DNS sub-system of the victim organisations. This type of attack brought the targets down in two ways; bandwidth exhaustion and by overwhelming processing capacity.\n\nBandwidth exhaustion, a result of continuous querying of the victim DNS by a botnet, caused the network pipes of the target's DNS server to become saturated, resulting in an error message for legitimate users. This was then complicated by a ton of very large DNS packets being sent, thus overwhelming it's transactional capabilities. So, even if the attack didn't saturate the bandwidth, it would saturate the computing resources of the target. Pretty sneaky.\n\nDDoS attacks, while previously a nuisance, are now a fact of life on the web. They aren't going anywhere, so enterprises need to have a battle plan for combating this ever-evolving threat.\n\nIn 2013, we expect to see more enterprises trying to block harmful traffic before it reaches the network or application to eliminate the many risks associated with cyber-attacks, like data breaches and network downtime.\n\nAs the traditional solutions on which many enterprises have relied for this - like over-provisioning bandwidth and firewalls - have proved costly and ineffective, companies will turn to cloud-based DDoS protection and managed DNS services to enable rapid deployment, provide transactional capacity to handle proactive mitigation, and eliminate the need for significant investments in equipment, infrastructure and subject matter expertise.\n\nTaking the cloud approach will help businesses trim operational costs while hardening their defenses to thwart even the largest and most complex attacks. These cloud-based solutions will be critical in the future (they arguably already are). As companies and individuals become more reliant on the internet for critical processes and everyday tasks, downtime, no matter the reason, will not be an option"}
{"text":"According to the blurb on YouTube, the video lets you ride shotgun with a packet of data\u2014one of trillions involved in the trillions of Internet interactions that happen every second to see how the internet worksThis is another video that explains how the Internet works from Ericson, that was around when I was a newbie networker.\n\nSocial networks' role in the growth of the global virtual society has beenwelldocumented. What is not so well documented according to Help Net Security is the role social networks have in spreading malware. The security and privacy mechanisms of social networking firms such as LinkedIn (LNKD), Twitter and Facebook (FB) have proven insufficient to prevent exploitation.\n\nThe article notes that \"To Err is Human,\" and human errors lead to exploitation and manipulation whether the social network is online or offline. Social networks hold a plethora of personal information on the users that form the network. Individual connections between users collectively form a web of connections. To build each link between users an implicit trust is required between the two users and implicitly across the entire network. Any information provided by an individual user through chained connections becomes a part of the full network. When an attacker is able to exploit one user in the social network, they have the potential to be able to push malicious content into the network. The network's connectivity enables the spread of the exploitation. The blog explains that attackers exploit the weakest link in the chain.\n\nThe inability of users to determine the legitimacy of content flowing through the social network aids this exploitation process. Help Net Security says the biggest problem with the online social networks is that they do not have built-in protection against malware. For example, current social networks do not scan the URL's and embedded content coming from third-party servers such as Content Delivery Networks. Therefore, there is no way to authenticate the URL's passed among the user objects in the social networks.\n\nThe infection process begins with the exploitation of human ignorance and followed by spreading of the malware through the trust upon which the network is based.\n\nThe article further explains that to start the exploitation process, an attacker will pick an issue that affects human emotions to evoke a response so the social network user will do something the attacker wishes. Phishing and spam messages about weather calamities, politics and financial transactions are used for starting infections. The author states that since social network exploitation begins by exploiting an individual's ignorance common attack strategies have emerged.\n\nOne of the simplest infection techniques is to put malicious URLs on a user's Facebook message wall. When a user clicks on an illegitimate hyperlink it can result in automatic download of malware through the browser. Some of exploits used are:\n\nBrowser Exploit Packs (BEP) which fingerprint the browser version and other software on the user machine. Based on this information, a suitable malware is served to the user which uses exploits for that particular browser.\n\nDrive-by-Download attacks begin by visiting a malicious page. They exploit vulnerabilities in browsers and plugins. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability causes a shell code to run that in turn downloads the malware into the system.\n\nMalicious advertisements (malvertisements) happen when an attacker injects a malicious link in a users Facebook wall to spread malware. The fake post is linked to a third-party website which has malicious advertisements embedded in it. These advertisements are linked to malicious JavaScripts which executes the malicious content in the browser.\n\nHelp Net Security states that online social networks are not harnessing the power of Safe Browsing API's from Google (GOOG) or similar services to instantiate a verification procedure before posting a URL back to a user profile. Lack of such basic protections is a key factor in making the social networks vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) recently spotted a Facebook attack in the wild that exploited Facebook users trust in a social engineering campaign. The attack tries to trick Facebook users into installing a backdoor Trojan with keylogging capabilities according to the Help Net Securityreport.\n\nMSFT says the Facebook Wall messages varied but they all lead to fake YouTube pages. Once there, the user is urged to download a new version of \"Video Embed ActiveX Object\" to play the video file. Unfortunately, the offered setup.exe file is the Caphaw Trojan.\n\nThe trojan bypasses firewalls, installs a FTP and a proxy server and a keylogger on the affected machine. Microsoft's Mihai Calota says \" \u2026 has built-in remote desktop functionality based on the open source VNC project.\" MSFT says the Facebook attack can be used to steal money, \"We received a report .. that money had been transferred from his bank account \u2026 The keylogging component, coupled with the remote desktop functionality, makes it entirely possible for this to have happened.\"\n\nrb-\n\nThe articles correctly state that security and privacy mechanisms are indispensable for safe online social networking. Built-in security is necessary because attackers exploit the trust, curiosity and ignorance of the social network customers to their own profit. User should demand safe and secure transmission of the information and user's privacy. These should also be a focus of the social networking companies.\n\nTo protect themselves, users should:\n\nHave up to date AV software running on their computers\n\nKeep their browsers and operating systems fully patched\n\nChange the passwords on all their sensitive accounts regularly\n\nWarn friends and Facebook if an account seems to be hacked by using the Facebook \"report\/mark message as spam\" option.\n\nAT&T posted the 1963 short \"Robot\" on the company's ATTTechChannel section on YouTube, addresses the anxiety felt by humans in regard to machines and computers. The article says the film was \"made for an elite seminar given for business owners, on the then-brand-new topic\u2013Data Communications,\" AT&T explains on the YouTube page. And the company continues:\n\n\"The organizers of the seminar, Inpro, actually set the tone for the film in a three-page memo from one of Inpro's principals, Ted Mills, to Henson. Mills outlined the nascent, but growing relationship between man and machine: a relationship not without tension and resentment\u2026.\"\n\nDisplaying his mastery of slapstick, comic timing, and sound effects, Henson uses his humorously menacing star, \"Computer H14,\" to reassure viewers that they need not be alarmed: humans remain in control according to CNet.\n\ndeProviding a seamless transition for users is incredibly important. Yahoo! will continue to manage Delicious over the next couple months as users are able to sign up for new accounts. After the transition period is complete, users' information will be moved over to the new service.\n\n\"As we have said, part of our product strategy involves shifting our investment with off-strategy products to put better focus on our core strengths and fund new innovation, says staff on Yahoo! blog.

The firms resolves 30 billion DNS queries per day and services 15 million requesting IP addresses per day. OpenDNS has released the OpenDNS 2010 Report Web Content Filtering and Phishing, (PDF) which highlights their 2010 findings about web content filtering with data from their global vantage point.\n\nWeb-based content can be filtered by subscribing to services like OpenDNS. These firms categorize the content on the web into broad categories like porn or hate or gambling and allow organizations to block all content that the service providers places in these categories. For more granular control content may also be filtered by blocking specific websites via blacklisting or by allowing specific websites via whitelisting.\n\nBlacklists are typically used when there is no wish to block an entire category in principle, but there is a focus on preventing traffic to specific websites based on a combination of their popularity and content.\n\nWhitelists are typically used when there is a desire to block entire categories, but access to selected websites is granted on an exception basis. These sites represent the most trusted sites in their category.\n\nThe World's Most Blocked Websites - OpenDNS\n\nWhitelisted\n\nBlacklisted\n\nYahoo.com\n\n3.9\n\nPlayboy.com\n\n1.2\n\nSite\n\n%\n\nSite\n\n%\n\nYouTube.com\n\n12.7\n\nFacebook.com\n\n14.2\n\nFacebook.com\n\n12.6\n\nMySpace.com\n\n9.9\n\nGmail.com\n\n9.2\n\nYouTube.com\n\n8.1\n\nGoogle.com\n\n9.0\n\nDoubleclick.net\n\n6.4\n\nTranslate.Google.com\n\n6.3\n\nTwitter.com\n\n2.3\n\nLinkedIn.com\n\n6.0\n\nAd.yieldmanager.com\n\n1.9\n\nMySpace.com\n\n4.7\n\nRedtube.com\n\n1.4\n\nSkype.com\n\n4.6\n\nLimewire.com\n\n1.3\n\nDeviantart.com\n\n4.3\n\nPornhub.com\n\n1.2\n\nThe report says that businesses have specific goals in mind when blocking websites. They need to ensure compliance with HR policies, while also increasing worker productivity by preventing what they consider to be employee cyberslacking. According to the OpenDNS report the business list confirms that businesses are singling out popular sites considered to be of little value in a work setting, especially if they consume a lot of bandwidth. Filtering by Business Users:\n\nThe blacklisted sites suggests a concern with the use of bandwidth by streaming sites and with privacy concerns from advertising networks. We will be exploring the web app Meebo, which lets users get on web 2.0 apps like MSN, Yahoo, AOL\/AIM, MySpace, Facebook and Google Talk by simply using a browser and a popular workaround even when the desktops are locked down.\n\nThe fact that many of the same sites that appear on both the Whitelisted and Blacklisted lists is a sign of how confused the responses are to social networking, All the better reason to have a social media policy in place."}

The worm spreads through email messages with the subject line \"Here you have;\" the body of the message includes a link that appears to lead to a PDF file, but instead leads to a malicious executable file. Once the worm has infected the PC it will try to disable security software and then sends itself to everyone in the infected computer's email contact list.\n\nAccording to various reports, in the past few days a large number of websites created using WordPress have been hacked. . Unconfirmed reports by WPSecurityLock suggest that other PHP-based management systems, such as the Zen Cart eCommerce solution, have also been targeted.\n\nThe hacked web pages appear to have been infected with scripts, which not only install malware on users' systems, but also prevent browsers like Firefox and Google Chrome, which use Google's Safe Browsing API, from issuing an alert when users try to access the page. When Google's search bot encounters such a specially crafted page, the page responds by simply returning harmless code. This camouflage strategy takes advantage of the browser switch normally used by developers to return browser specific code to suit functional variations in different browser, such as Internet Explorer and Firefox.\n\nExperts are currently still puzzled over which hole was actually exploited for the large-scale attack. The only thing that seems certain at this point is that the problem didn't originate in WordPress, because if this was the case considerably more pages would have been infected.

{"text":"11, 2008\n\nApple hackers increasing\n\nHackers have started to pay greater attention to Apple devices as their popularity worldwide has expanded. Security experts claim that hackers have focused efforts towards the Windows platform because Microsoft has controlled more than 90 percent of the global market for years. This ensured hackers would have a wealth of targets to exploit.\n\nCameron Hotchkies, a Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) security analyst, believes Macintosh computers have been gaining market share and in the same process catching the interest of hackers. \"It has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in,\" said the security specialist. Hotchkiesis a part of a team devoted to studying programming holes and crafting \"patches\" to prevent hackers from exploiting weaknesses, specifically on Apple software.\n\nHotchkies noted that this year there was a spike in the number of DefCon attendees carrying Macintosh laptops. DefCon is an annual conference where specialists such as Hotchkies gatherer and hold sessions on weakness in todays electronics. It is also noteworthy that more than a thousand people crammed into his DefCon talk about hacking Apple software, a number far greater than seen in the past.\n\nAnother problem may be that developers who re-craft their software to work on a Mac, may not be capable of building security components as they are not familiar with platform. \"Windows developers take their code and make it work on Apple,\" Hotchkies said. This, in theory, is good for Macs as it brings familiarity to the OS for potential switchers. \"They [windows developers] could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform,\" explained Hotchkies.\n\nIt should be noted that regardless of similar claims over the last 2 years, no attacks have reached Mac OS X consumers. Several proof-of-concept attacks have been displayed, but these typically required users to consent to installation of a 'disguised' virus.\n\nYes, yes, we know Macs aren't exploit-proof, they're just exploit-resistant. Luckily resistance is not futile, especially when IE is still wearing the ActiveX underpants with the \"please exploit me\" label on the waistband.\n\nThere is nothing new here. What is the point of this article? The Mac is growing in popularity and there is a belief that hackers are now focusing on the Mac platform. Wow, I'm surprised I didn't get a CNN Newsflash on this!\n\nSeveral proof-of-concept attacks have been displayed, but these typically required users to consent to installation of a 'disguised' virus.\n\nHow many new Windows 'virus' are out there? From what I've seen, most either get through IE (which require plug-in installation which the user usually has to OK - and apparently do without thinking) or trojans (if it requires installation, its not a 'disguised virus', but a trojan).\n\nNumber of hackers use Macs, but doesn't mean they hack OSX. They typically boot into linux to hack windows. They use OSX for when they are surfing the web, etc. They use windows for games. All done on the same Mac, easily.\n\nLet me know when these so-called \"hackers\" are able to do something to my Mac without physically sitting in front of it with my admin password in hand. Honestly, the FUD is just retarded. Spend more time reporting the truth of the situation and less time spreading FUD.\n\nIs anyone else tired of that lame \"no one attacks Macs because there aren't enough of them.\" People - even .1% of the market is millions of machines. It's hard for me to imagine hackers sitting around saying, \"golly, let's not code a Mac virus, even though we would be incredibly famous for doing it, because it would only run on a small percentage of computers.\"\n\nDoofuses. And these so-called \"computer security experts\" are even bigger doofuses."}
{"text":"Preventing and fighting cybersecurity threats has little to do with having the most advanced technology and everything to do with having a well-trained workforce, according to a panel of IT and homeland security officials who met in Washington this week to discuss the issue.\n\nCybersecurity experts, as well as state and local government representatives, met at the three-day AFCEA Homeland Security Conference in Washington, D.C. to discuss homeland security IT issues.\n\nTo get that workforce, the government must look beyond social stigmas, said panelist Ovie Carroll, director of the Cybercrime Lab for the U.S. Department of Justice. Many of the people who are most knowledgeable about cybersecurity are high school and college dropouts -- two demographics that are often overlooked by the government, he said.\n\nThe best defense strategy for cybersecurity, said Major TJ O'Connor, is to be on the offense and have people who know how to think like a hacker. O'Connor noted that he got one of his first offense lessons during his hours playing the war video game Command and Conquer while at West Point.\n\nCyberattacks could take minutes to cause wide-reaching damage. So to speed up the response time, the role of local law enforcement in fighting cyberattacks needs to be defined, said Lieutenant Colonel Robert Fanelli. Policymakers also need to define what a cybersecurity threat is. They must set quickly guidelines for deciphering between a criminal behavior and an annoying one, he said.\n\n\"Responding effectively to an incident does not leave a lot of time for debating policy,\" Fanelli said. \"What happens if a major incident happens tomorrow night? Are we ready to go?\"\n\nThere are a number of ways to defend against cyber threats \u2013 many of which people not well-versed in computer science may not understand -- but the panelists offered a few key tips for federal, state and local stakeholders to take into account:\n\nHave more than one solution. If officials rely on only one method to prevent and fight threats, they will inevitably lose the cyberwar when that solution is breached.\n\nChange with technology. \"Every two years, what you're teaching today is obsolete,\" said Skip Runyan, who trains cyber warfare operators on the 39th Information Operations Squadron. Because of this, his unit may apply expiration dates to all of their lessons.\n\nDon't assume that newer means safer. O'Connor said there's a misconception that the latest versions of programs such as operating systems will best protect that system's data. This is often untrue, though, and more recent versions of programs may be more susceptible to cyber threats.\n\nUnderstand that one person can have a huge impact. With this in mind, cybersecurity experts must take every possible threat seriously -\u2013 whether it's from an organized hacking group or a 14-year-old boy.\n\nDespite any measures the public sector takes to guard against cyber threats, though, any attack on the private sector can be just as damaging to the public sector and the people it serves. \"What about all the privately-owned networks? How do we get them to care?\" asked Fanelli. One possible answer, he said, is offering incentives \u2013 such as tax breaks -- to companies that safeguard their networks"}

For whatever reason the hacker may have, hacking the government, or even the White House, would be an extremely difficult task, that would bring a lot of bragging rights if accomplished.\n\nWell it appears that someone (or some people) were successful in hacking into the White House network in September. The hack, which appears to have come from Chinese computer servers, breached a system used by the White House Military Office for nuclear commands, according to defense and intelligence officials familiar with the incident.\n\nThe hack was accomplished using a technique called \"spear-phishing\" says Huff Post, in which they target victims who have access to sensitive computer networks by sending personalized emails that appear to come from trusted sources. Once the victims click on the bogus attachment or link, the hackers can install malicious software on the PCs to spy on users and steal data. White House officials said that the attack was on an unclassified network, where no data was removed."}

This has been proven to be wrong.

Malcolm holds a bachelors of arts degree in religious studies from Lewis and Clark College in Oregon.\n\nPrivacy and Indentity Theft - Reaping what we sow\n\nI recently came across an interesting article regarding the increasing problems with thieves targeting schools for identify theft.\n\nThe article mentions an incident where a hacker broke into a database at a school in El Paso, and managed to retrieve 63,000 Social Security numbers (SSNs) of students.\n\nThis is a gold-mine for an identity thief. SSNs can be used to get credit cards, take out loans, and generally \"create\" money for the thief. Furthermore, the SSNs of young people are generally \"clean\", meaning they have no credit history attached, making it far easier to get credit with them. Finally, if the SSNs used are those of very young students, it may be years before that student actually tries to use it to get credit legitimately, and thus years before the identity theft is detected.\n\nThere have even been some experts suggesting that parents sign up their very\nyoung children for the sort of automatic credit check services that the government recommends for adults, to try to catch these sorts of issues early.\n\nMany would shake their heads at this, and wonder why the school in question didn't do a better job of protecting the database that was attacked.\n\nWhile this perspective is certainly legitimate, anyone who has worked in the IT security space for a decent amount of time would tell you that no matter how well protected the system, there is no such thing as perfect security. Bugs creep in, new attacks are developed, systems are misconfigured. A determined attacker can usually find their way in, and good information security practice can only reduce risk, not eliminate it.\n\nReducing risk significantly is usually an expensive proposition, requiring high levels of specialized knowledge, and expensive hardware and software tools that many schools can't afford. Furthermore, there is usually an inverse relationship between how secure a system is, and how functional it is - the more secure, the less capabilities it has, and the harder it is to use for legitimate purposes. IT groups are usually tasked with making things easier for their users, not harder, so security often falls to the bottom of the priority list.\n\nThat all being said, the attacker's job would have been much harder if the El Paso school hadn't been collecting SSNs from students to begin with.\n\nWhy were they? I expect the answer is convenience.\n\nCertainly, as we move towards using information technology in all aspects of our lives, the temptation to gather more data than we might necessarily need to accomplish our goals is ever-present. Data collection and organization is often fantastically easy these days, so why not collect it? It might come\nin handy later.\n\nOn a related note, designers of information systems often make assumptions about what data is or should be available, especially for identification and indexing purposes. SSNs are a prime example \u2013 from the perspective of an software designer who is not well educated on security issues, the use of SSNs seems like a great idea. Everyone has one, it's unique, and after all, it's already widely used. Why not require this data and use it to uniquely identify students?\n\nThe answer to that question, of course, was answered for the folks in El Paso.\n\nIt behooves us to be very, very careful about the data we collect. We need to develop an understanding of the other purposes the data might be used for, and understand, further, that we don't own the data, and are responsible to the real owners, the students, for protecting it when we do collect it.\n\nIn the case of SSNs, if the only reason that a school is using them is to uniquely identify a student, a far better approach would be to assign each student a unique ID number when they enter the school system, completely unrelated to the student's SSN. That number should be unique, random, and contain no \"in-band\" data that could be used to infer the age of the student, their location, or any other personal information about the student.\n\nThis approach dramatically reduces the risk associated with holding that data, rather than exposing the student to risks that should more appropriately be carried solely by the school.\n\nWhile security is often at odds with functionality, there is significant room for improvement at all phases of development \u2013 especially in the design phase, where decisions about what sorts of data will be collected are properly made. Trying to add on adequate security controls after the design is set is a losing proposition, and leads to issues that could have been avoided if more thought had been given to security through the entire development process"}

So the chances are very good that Sony was not in compliance either.\n\n@kunic This is very likely. The reason the network is still down is because the credit card companies won't let them bring it up. If they remove all the payment services from PSN then they can bring back the other functions. It's also why SOE will probably be out longer. They are based on pay-for-play service and could be held hostage by Visa\/Mastercard until they can come to an agreement with Sony.\n\n@aurickle One question aurickle, why is it none of those other companies you mention had their networks taken down for weeks at a time? Could it be that their data breaches were relatively limited in scope?\n\nThe reason Sony is in so much hot water is because their negligence is on a scale yet unseen in a major online business. That's why PSN is not up yet. The Payment Card Industry will not allow Sony to do business on the internet until they finish their review of the incident. No company that has been PCI compliant has had a major data breach. Sony was supposed to be PCI compliant, they were not. Your constant whining about how every other company on the net is unsecure just doesn't hold water.

{"text":"Fighting\nComputer Crime by Combining Federal and State Law\n\nWith the advent of the\ncomputer age, legislatures have been struggling to redefine the law to fit crimes\nperpetrated by computer age criminals. Although copyright law is effective for\ncivil litigation, many computer crimes resemble more traditional offenses such\nas trespass and theft. In 1978, Florida became the first state to pass criminal\nstatutes specifically directed towards computer crime, an act quickly followed\nby all other states.1 However, computer crimes remain an enigma.\nA Lexis search of all jurisdictions reported only thirty-six published opinions\nmentioning computer crimes, and half of those were cases addressing separate\nlegal issues.2 Yet, the government estimates that over $500 million\na year is lost due to specific computer crimes.3 With the advent\nof the internet and the ease of telecommunications many potential computer crimes\nhave moved beyond the jurisdiction of individual states. The Federal Government\nmust now shoulder the burden of enforcement and prevention. Although existing\nfederal statutes enable prosecution of computer crimes, these statutes have\nproven inadequate. This paper examines the weakness in federal legislation used\nfor computer crime, the inadequacies of states to fully enforce computer crimes,\nand suggests a union of state law and federal jurisdiction as a possible solution.\n\nI. The Inadequacy of\nFederal Legislation\n\nThe Computer Fraud and\nAbuse act of 19864 (CFAA) was intended to be the chief weapon for\na federal assault on computer crimes. The statute criminalizes six activities:\n(1) the unauthorized access of a computer to obtain information of national\nsecrecy with an intent to injure the United States; (2) the unauthorized access\nof a computer to obtain protected financial information; (3) the unauthorized\naccess of a computer intended for the exclusive use of the federal government;\n(4) the unauthorized interstate access of a computer system with an intent to\ndefraud; (5) the unauthorized interstate access of computer systems that results\nin at least $1000 aggregate damage; and (6) the fraudulent trafficking in computer\npasswords affecting interstate commerce.5 However, CFAA is rarely\nused and has received little attention from Federal prosecutors.\n\nSince its enactment, there\nhas been one successful prosecution under CFAA. In 1991, the Second Circuit\nupheld the conviction of a college graduate student who released a virus on\nthe internet causing several governmental computer systems to crash.6\nThe court refrained from a broad interpretation of CFAA, and instead limited\ntheir scope to discussing the intent requirement in the statute. Although the\nCircuit Court upheld the conviction, the court's narrow construction has limited\nCFAA for future prosecution.\n\nThe weakness in CFAA results\nfrom Congress' original purpose to narrow the statute to fraud and abuse only\nagainst the federal government. Although the act also criminalizes unauthorized\ninterstate access of computer systems, this section only encompasses cases involving\n\"federal interest computers,\" which are defined specifically in the\nact.7 Congress wanted to allow the states more leeway in enforcing\nstate criminal statutes, but failed to comprehend the exponential increase in\nprivate interstate computer activity. Even if CFAA is construed broadly by another\ncourt, the $1000 minimum damage amount in subsection (5) will force prosecutors\nto estimate the worth of various forms of intellectual property, a problem already\nevident under other criminal statutes. Stealing confidential information, such\nas prospective business plans or personal information, may have incredible subjective\nvalue, but worth little to an uninterested party. Because of its narrow scope,\nprosecutors have avoided CFAA, and instead relied on the more effective, Wire\nFraud Statute and the National Stolen Property Act.\n\nThe Federal Wire Fraud\nStatute proscribes the use of wire communications in interstate or foreign commerce\nto further a scheme to defraud.8 A scheme to defraud is wronging\none in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes, usually through\ndepriving someone something of value by trick, deceit, chicane, or overreaching.9\nWhile the statute has been used for computer crimes, the application is often\na stretch.\n\nOne of the first cases\napplying computer crime to the Wire Fraud Statute was United States v. Seidlitz.10\nIn Seidlitz, the defendant helped prepare software developed for a government\nproject in Maryland. Following his resignation, Seidlitz later downloaded software\nfrom the project by breaking into the government's security system.11\nThe court upheld the government's theory that the defendant had devised a scheme\nto defraud in obtaining the software. According to the court, the scheme was\nbased on Seidlitz defrauding the government's computer--there were no individuals\nbeing defrauded.\n\nIn a more recent case,\nUnited States v. Riggs12, two students broke into a computer\nowned by Bell South Telephone in order to steal emergency services software.\nOne of the students accessed the computer through the phone lines, acquired\nthe software, and then disguised his unauthorized access by using account codes\nof current employees. He then transferred the code through modem to another\nstate where his accomplice edited the code to conceal its origin and published\nthe text in a computer newsletter. Similar to Seidlitz, the government\nproved that the two defendants had devised a scheme to defraud by downloading\ninformation, rather than defrauding individuals.\n\nWire Fraud has also been\nused where the perpetrators never even physically or electronically acquired\nthe property. In United States v. Schreier, the defendant schemed to\nacquire airplane tickets through American Airlines by fraudulently rearranging\nfrequent flyer miles through the airline's computer system. The court held that\nthe Wire Fraud Statute does not require that the defendant actually acquire\nthe property, only if any person actually obtains the property. Furthermore,\nbecause of the fraud, American Airlines now had an economic liability -they\nowed someone a free ticket.13 In this case, the information was merely\ntransferred from one account to another, yet the defendant never actually received\nthe tickets. Schreier seems to follow the same logic of well settled\nlaw that fraudulently obtaining money through electronic transfers is wire fraud.14\nThus, the holding may limit prosecution under wire fraud where property has\nno objective tangible value, but is still valuable to the owner.\n\nEstablishing the concept\nof property for computer code as applied to the Wire Fraud Statute, has raised\nsome serious questions in the courts. Most notably, whether or not the information\nstolen was something of value or was something tangible. When someone steals\nsoftware from a computer system, the thief only acquires a copy, thus they are\nnot depriving the owner of title to the information, only the rights to sole\nownership and possible future profits.15 Both Riggs and Seidlitz\nconcerned information of value, and the defendants had intent to use the information\nfor profit. Consequently, if fraudulently acquiring property has no economic\ngain or loss to the parties, Wire Fraud may be unusable.\n\nThe Supreme Court has yet\nto rule on the applicability of the Wire Fraud Statute to computer crimes, but\nhas addressed the issue of pure intellectual rights in Mail Fraud. In United\nStates v. McNally16, the court held that mail fraud is limited\nto schemes aimed at causing deprivations of money or property. A few months\nlater, the court modified its reasoning in United States v. Carpenter17,\nruling that there is a property interest if the scheme deprives one of \"exclusive\nuse\" to their information. These contrasting opinions predict an unclear future\nfor defining intangible property rights in Wire Fraud. Craig M. Bradley argues\nthat future cases may require an economic gain to the defendant or economic\nloss to the victim.18 Bradley points out that if \"exclusive\nuse\" is the standard, \"exclusive use\" may be violated without\nany clear scheme to defraud. For example, if the defendant in Carpenter\nwere to come home and explain to his family about the article he was going to\nwrite, he would still be depriving his employer of exclusive use over the article.\nHowever, the loss of confidential information is only a deprivation of a property\ninterest if the loss threatens the victim with economic harm.19 Bradley\nargues that to maintain consistency in the law, an economic interest must be\na requirement for fraud.20 The Sixth Circuit agreed with Bradley's\nreasoning. In a subsequent case, the Circuit Court interpreted McNally\nand Carpenter as limiting Mail Fraud to schemes that have as their goal\nthe transfer of something of economic value to the defendant.21\n\nRequiring an economic gain\nor loss in Wire Fraud will limit the statute's application to some computer\ncrimes. If a thief downloaded a personal journal from another computer, the\njournal will probably not have any economic value to the defendant or victim,\nyet the act is still criminal. Downloading a personal journal without consent\nis theft, just as stealing a journal from a desk is theft. However, the actual\njournal has real property value in its pages and binding, while the computer\nversion has none.\n\nAdditionally, the traditional\nnotion of fraud seems to exclude some computer crimes. Congress' original intent\nwith Mail Fraud contemplated wronging one in his property rights by dishonest\nmethods or schemes.22 With common law theft, however, there is no\ndishonesty to another party before acquiring the property-the property is merely\ntaken without consent. Downloading computer information without authorization\nseems to resemble theft more then fraud, while breaking into a computer system\nresembles trespass more than a scheme to defraud. Even though simple trespass\nand theft may fit into Wire Fraud, a court would probably not find a scheme\nto defraud if the defendant in Riggs had only planned the scheme through\nelectronic mail and then physically picked the lock at Bell South to steal certain\ndocuments. In response to maintaining a tighter fit between traditional theft\nand computer theft, federal prosecutors have attempted to use the National Stolen\nProperty Act as a basis for conviction.\n\nThe National Stolen Property\nAct (NSPA) criminalizes interstate transportation of stolen or fraudulently\nobtained property in excess of $1000.23 The Riggs court also\nconvicted the defendants under NSPA. However, the classification of intangible\nproperty is in more jeopardy under NSPA than Mail Fraud. The Supreme Court suggested\nin United States v. Dowling, that NSPA does not apply to the taking of\npurely intangible property.24Riggs distinguished Dowling\non the ground that the Supreme Court never construed the meaning of \"goods,\nwares or merchandise.\" The court noted that NSPA literally applied to theft\nof a tangible medium where intangible property was attached to it, such as a\nchemical formula written on a piece of paper. The court then reasoned that using\na modem to steal the information, rather than taking an actual data disk or\nprintout, should be no different - even though the information was stored inside\na computer rather than on a disk, it was still \"transferable and accessible.\"25\nThe 10th Circuit disagreed with Riggs. In United States v. Brown,\nthe Circuit Court held that stolen computer software did not constitute goods,\nwares, or merchandise as applied under NSPA.26 However, the Brown\ninterpretation allows inequitable results by punishing theft differently depending\non the worth of physical property. For example, if X uses his own diskette to\nsteal a computer file worth $ 1000, and Y steals a diskette worth $ 1 containing\na file worth $ 999. Under Brown, X may be prosecuted under the NSPA for\ntheft of $ 1000 worth of property, while Y may not be prosecuted under the NSPA\nat all. Yet, both acts result in the same economic loss. The battle between\nthe Riggs and Brown view is not over, and further differences\nin interpretation will only lead to a complete abandonment of using NSPA for\ncomputer crimes.\n\nAnother area that both\nNSPA and Wire Fraud fail to cover is the viewing of computer data. If someone\nbreaks into a computer system and then views certain information, such an act\nis still criminal and can be equally effective at obtaining wanted information-\njust as if Riggs had broken into South Bell and looked through file cabinets,\nrather than physically stealing the files. Although crimes of this type may\nfall under other areas, common law trespass would be more effective, since the\nmore obvious criminal act is breaking into the computer system, not defrauding\nthe owner.\n\nThe use of NSPA has been\nmore sparse then Wire Fraud in prosecuting computer crimes, and like Wire Fraud,\nwill continue to challenge federal prosecutors and courts in fighting computer\ncrime. However, the federal government is not alone in fighting computer crime,\nstates have also enacted statutes addressing this new technology. Although state\nlaws attack computer crimes in more practical ways, they carry a heavier burden\nof enforcement.\n\nII. The Inadequacy of\nState Jurisdiction and Resources\n\nState statutes are generally\nmore practical in fitting computer crime with other traditional statutess.Some academics argue that state law is currently adequate to handle computer\ncrime and that further federal legislation is unnecessary.27 In reality,\nstates do not have to enact specific computer crime law - defining property\nrights and other computer lingo may be enough to use existing statutes against\ntheft, destruction of property, and trespass for prosecution.28 However,\nas the internet continues to expand and crimes continue to become more interstate,\nstate legislation will be less effective. Determining proper venue for the crime\nis bound to become an issue. Only one published case has ruled on venue from\ncounty to county in the same state, but none has specifically addressed jurisdiction\nbetween sovereigns.29 Furthermore, contrasting laws between states\npose greater problems. For example, if a casino in Las Vegas decided to run\na roulette wheel through the internet so users could play live - using their\ncredit cards as money, the casino may escape liability. The gambling operation\nis perfectly legal in Nevada, while illegal under Wisconsin law. In Wisconsin\nthe gambler can be prosecuted, because state law only requires that a \"bet\"\nbe made.30 Prosecuting the Las Vegas casino in Wisconsin is another\ndifficulty, yet the casino is clearly criminal by an extension of their gambling\ninto Wisconsin through the internet. Furthermore, Wisconsin officials will be\ninhibited at stamping out casino gambling, since prosecuting every individual\nis more difficult and less effective than prosecuting the source of the gambling.\nCriminal conduct originating out of state carries a greater burden of prosecution\ndue to extra travel, availability of witnesses, and accessibility to information.\nIn an era of budget limitations, state legislatures may be unwilling to cough\nup additional resources for interstate crime, especially if they see interstate\ncomputer crime as a federal issue.\n\nState courts may also be\nineffective. Computer technology is often difficult to understand and it is\nimportant to consider the ramifications for setting precedent in computer law.\nBecause federal judges are sparse and have smaller case loads, they will be\nmore able to envision the national scope of computer crime. A unified law makes\nprosecution more efficient and more likely, thus also increasing deterrence\nfor future computer criminals.\n\nJurisdictional enigmas\nwill continue to haunt prosecution of computer crimes as long as state statutes\nremain diverse. Problems such as difficulty in proving venue and extraditing\ncriminals will only lead to some criminals escaping the law due to inadequate\nresources. The expanding scope of private interstate computer crime clearly\npoints to the federal government as the ultimate enforcer. However, Congress\nfirst needs to learn from the states in enacting proper statutes that attack\ncomputer crimes more traditionally and more vigorously. The next section suggests\na union between these two issues: federal jurisdiction and state law.\n\nIII. Combining State\nand Federal Strengths through Federal Legislation\n\nTo enable more diligent\nprosecution of computer crimes, Congress must rehabilitate federal computer\ncrime law. Current manipulation of Wire Fraud, a narrow vision of CFAA, and\ncontrasting opinions of property value in the National Stolen Property act only\nserve to inhibit the government in successful prosecution of serious crimes.\nFirst, Congress must address all possible crimes that may be committed interstate\nthrough a computer. Although crimes such as theft and trespass are usually considered\nlocal crimes, computer activity elevates these crimes to an interstate level\n- legislation should handle them at an interstate level. To supersede state\ncriminal statutes, federal statutes should address all traditional state crimes\napplicable to computer activity limiting the crimes to computers so as not to\nusurp other areas state jurisdiction.31 Allowing prosecutors to charge\ncrimes more relevant to actual conduct will limit the potential for absurd charging\ndecisions and confusing precedent. Furthermore, federal attention to computer\ncrimes will assure jurisdictional certainty and will relieve states from the\nburdens of complex investigation and extradition of those who may reside in\nother states.\n\nFederal agents are better\nequipped to investigate interstate computer criminals. In addition to the vast\ntechnical resources of the federal government, there are government agents in\nevery state, reducing the overhead cost of investigating interstate crime. If\na crime is committed in Wisconsin by a casino in Las Vegas through the internet,\nfederal agents in Nevada are in a better position to respond more quickly and\nmore effectively than Wisconsin investigators.\n\nFurthermore, to gradate\ncrimes of damage and theft for sentencing requirements, confusing damage assessments\nmust be amended to allow alternatives. Because estimating the actual worth of\nintellectual property is controversial, much time and resources will be spent\non judging the worth of property stolen or damaged. Instead, a sentencing structure\ncould be gradated based on the number of bytes transferred or destroyed in addition\nto monetary thresholds. For example, the threshold for theft of computer property\nat level 1 in the federal guidelines could be $100 or 100 kilobytes, subject\nto the prosecutor's choice.\n\nIn addition to federal\nlegislation, the reporting of computer crime must be encouraged. One method\nmay be federal regulation of computer security requirements and diligent reporting\nof criminal activity to insurance companies. However, regulation may not be\nnecessary. As losses continue to rise because of computer fraud and theft, insurance\ncompanies may demand more security, and reports of crimes from clients in exchange\nfor more coverage and lower rates.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the climate of interstate\ncomputer use continues to change, the law needs to adapt. Current federal statutes,\nsuch as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Wire Fraud, and the National Stolen\nProperty Act, are inadequate to handle what should be more typical state law\ncrimes of trespass and theft. While state statutes remain more practical, their\neffectiveness is limited to state jurisdiction and state resources. Federal\nlegislation encompassing state computer crime statutes will overcome the difficulties\nexisting in current federal legislation, However, with the advent of new technologies\nsuch as artificial intelligence, computer crime legislation is bound to encounter\nnew roadblocks. If current law is unsettled, future law will be disastrous."}

And finally, there is the explanation most often put forward: criminal intent.\n\nWhatever the reason, as long as computers exists there will be hackers - white hats, black hats and grey hats. And because there is no way of predicting which kind of attack ('curiosity' versus 'malicious') will hit your computer first, it is always best to be prepared for the worst.\n\nThe truth is that in hours of a machine being connected to the Internet, somebody will scan it with an automated vulnerability probing tool, looking for ways to get in. It may be somebody who is just curious to see what is on the machine, or a white hat from the other side of the world checking to see if the computer is secure. Of course, in real life you wouldn't want passing strangers stopping to check if your house or car were locked, and, if not, to go inside, look around, go through your possessions and leave a note saying 'Hi, I was here, your door was open, but don't mind me and BTW, fix your lock'. If you wouldn't want someone to do this to your house, you wouldn't want someone doing it to your computer. And there is no excuse for doing it to someone else's computer either.\n\nPremeditated, criminal, hacking is obviously even worse. In the real world, somebody walks by, breaks your lock, gets inside, disables your alarm system, steals something or plants listening devices in your phone or surveillance equipment in your living room. If this happens you call the police, they look around, write a report, and you wait for the thieves to be caught. Unfortunately, this is a rare luxury in the computer world; the culprit may be far, far way, downloading your confidential files while sitting in his personal villa or sunbathing by his huge pool, nicely built with stolen money. Or, in a business environment, many large corporations prefer not to report hacking incidents at all, in order to protect their company image. This means that the criminals remain unpunished.\n\nAnother hacker motivation may be hooliganism, or digital graffiti, which can be summed up as hacking into systems to cause damage. Web site defacement is a very popular form of digital graffiti and there are some hacking groups which focus on this task alone. Just as in the physical, non-cyber world, catching the hooligans is a tedious task which usually doesn't repay the effort or resources expended.\n\nWhatever the reasoning, be it 'to help others', 'security heads-up!', 'hooliganism' or 'criminal intent', hacking is a phenomenon which is deeply rooted in the world of computing and will probably never die. There will always be people immature enough to abuse public resources, self-proclaimed 'Robin Hoods' and criminals hiding in the dark alleys of cyberspace."}

The malicious software is said to be 20 times more powerful than other known cyber warfare programmes, that could only have been made by a state.\n\nKamran Napelian, an Iranian cyber defence official, said that the virus has a special pattern which makes it seem as if it has originated from Israel. \"The virus copies what you enter on your keyboard, it monitors what you see on your computer screen\" , he said.\n\nNapelian also disclosed that Flame had been active for at least six months now and had caused a \"massive\" data loss. He added that Iran has developed software to combat Flame.\n\nOrla Cox, a security analyst at the security firm Symantec, said that Flame was targeting specific individuals, mostly Iran-related. \"The way it has been developed is unlike anything we've seen before.

Scholarships were awarded to the top five national finishers.\n\nMore significant than the performance of the winners is the fact that more than 2,000 students from 169 schools in 32 states and three territories participated, said Julie Peeler, director of the (ISC)2 Foundation.\n\n\"That's a good number of kids who are being exposed to cybersecurity, regardless of whether they go into the profession,\" Peeler said. \"We are at least educating a larger workforce overall to an understanding of cybersecurity issues.\"\n\nIt also means that there are teachers in at least 169 schools who are aware of the importance of educating students on these issues.\n\nThe Cyber Foundation competitions are one part of a broader U.S. Cyber Challenge effort, which also includes summer camps for college, high school and younger students; the Cyber Patriot program run by the Air Force Association; and a number of other scholarship and training programs aimed at developing a future professional cybersecurity workforce. There also are training and competitive opportunities for professionals already in the workplace.\n\nThe top five finishers in the Cyber Foundation competition were:\n\nGavy Aggarwal of Charter School of Wilmington, Del.\n\nRyan Foster of the Polaris Career Center, Ohio.\n\nAndrey Kuklev of Huron High School in Michigan.\n\nJade Mollard of Damascus High School in Maryland.\n\nJeffrey Yuan of Mission San Jose High School in California.\n\nThey were awarded scholarships of $2,500, $1,500, $1,000, $750, and $500 respectively.\n\nU.S. Cyber Challenge, which set a goal in 2009 of identifying and recruiting 10,000 people with the native skills needed for cybersecurity, grew out of the report on Securing Cyberspace for the 44th Presidency, which was produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The report cited professional training and workforce development as a critical challenge in improving cybersecurity, with the demand for cybersecurity professionals expected to grow to 2.5 million new workers by 2015. Participants in the Cyber Challenge include CSIS, the Defense Department's Cyber Crime Center, the Air Force Association, SANS, and a number of universities and aerospace companies.\n\nAlthough there is an immediate need for cybersecurity professionals, the Cyber Challenge program also is working to create long-term supply by identifying students with the required skills in high school and earlier. One of the high school efforts is an online program run by the Cyber Foundation. It includes three class modules on networking, operating systems and system administration. When students have completed the modules they take online quizzes and compete for scholarship awards.\n\nThe state winners and top scoring students per high school are listed on the USCC website."}
{"text":"Postage Machine HackingTrying to Hack Government property Trying to defraud a Government organization Messing with the Postal Police\n\nAll federal pmita prison offenses.\n\nWord to the weary, those machines tend to stamp the unique machine ID as well as the postage paid stamp. They do audit usage. You or the company that owns the machine would be caught eventually.The above is the 'offical' Postal Regulation for an IBI or Information Based Indicia. All this information is contained in the 2-D barcode to the upper left of a piece of metered mail. Look at some of your junk mail and it will be very clear what I mean. It's that box that looks like Lattera's avatar. The column that says barcode are all of the data items in that 2-D barcode that I'm talking about and the Human Readable is what you can decipher when you look at it...date, time, etc.\n\nThe information is digitally signed so that when the Post Office reads the mail it can be fairly certain that it came from a particular licensed meter.\n\nWhat's crazy is that the meter internally communicates with 'itself' using an asymetric key system...public\/private. That is the meter contains a postal security device which is tamper resistant (of course resistance is a relative term) that sends out commands to create and sign the indicia with all the signals being encrypted. Think of it like an HTTPS setup for internal communications or more appropriately like each command being digitally signed. Digital signatures use the public\/private key system so this is closer to what is happening.\n\nThe whole postage meter industry is so wacky. What I mean is that to actually attack the meter directly is incredibly hard but not impossible;however, there are far easier ways to 'hack' a meter. The meter itself and access thereof is fairly easy due to primitive security. If you have physical control of a meter and a system that can interface with it you can do pretty much whatever you want. But not to be too much of a worry wort...printing postage is printing money; stamps are a legal form of tender so if you play games with this stuff the penalties are insanely harsh because of that. I know some smartass is saying to himself, \"Oh then I can use it to buy my groceries?\" Not exactly...unclaimed stamps can and must be refunded by the post office. If you show up with a stamp that is legally yours or if you can 'somehow' prove that that is a stamp of yours the post office refunds the amount on the stamp. Of course it isn't an immediate refund. You can't just show up with a meter label for a hundred bucks and walk away with a c-note.Good experiment...however metered mail expires one day after the date on the indicia date whether you see it or not. Sometimes the date may not be human readable but it is encrypted in the 2-D barcode. It's up to the local postmaster whether or not they accept it. If it is a day or two past the date a lot of the times they take it but they technically shouldn't. Therefore, meter mail is self-postmarkable...is that a word?Just giving you a warning. White hat or not, \"\"hacking\"\" is hacking, and can land you in jail if an over-zealous prosecutor or cop gets on your ass.\n\nAnd just like the chart that PS posted, some of that info is human readable. Just look at some of the mail stamped by that machine at your office, and you will see what the serial number of the machine is.\n\nHonestly, I thought that info to be pretty common knowledge in regards to barcodes and tracking of postage use.Bulk mail is pre-sorted by the mailer, and essentially pre-paid by contract with the USPS. No need to post-mark digitally scannable mail."}

A look at the top news stories of 2010 shows that the incidents that really captured the public's attention were the ones that nobody predicted. Here are a five of the top, unpredicted stories from the past year.\n\n1. Google gets hacked\n\nIn January, Google surprised everyone by admitting that it had been hit with a targeted cyber attack, now known as Aurora. Security insiders know that cleaning up hacked computers is just a cost of doing business today, but nobody predicted that a company like Google would voluntarily come forward and admit that it had been breached.\n\nThe Aurora incident wasn't a simple drive-by download. According to people familiar with the incident, hackers got deep inside Google's IT and were able to get control of critical internal systems. Nobody knows who pulled off the attack, but Google and the US Department of State seem to think that it came from China.\n\nThe Aurora hackers had also targeted at least 30 other major companies and Google's public admission put the cyber-espionage problem squarely on the corporate agenda.\n\n2. A worm targets critical industrial systems\n\nSecurity consultants had been warning about vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure systems for years now, but real-world bad guys have been too busy making money from hacked Windows desktops to pay much attention.\n\nAll of that changed in July 2010, when a little known Belarus company called VirusBlockAda discovered a strange and very sophisticated worm on computers in Iran. The more we learned about Stuxnet, the more incredible it seemed: a piece of malware that was written by people who could master both zero-day Windows vulnerabilities and obscure SCADA programming techniques, that sought out very specific industrial systems and then tried to destroy them.\n\n3.

{"text":"Cyber Warfare\n\nBY: Eric Holdeman | July 4, 2012\n\nOne of the rapidly changing aspects of our modern world is the ways in which we can conduct warfare. Lances and swords changed to guns and cannons, to aircraft and today one of the arrows in the quiver of warfare is cyber attack.\n\nNow nation states and other \"actors\" have the capability to do great harm to systems that we depend on for our daily lives. Listen to this KUOW NPR Radio show on the topic of Cyber Warfare There are rules of war. For instance you are not supposed to shoot at a pilot who has bailed out of an airplane as they are descending to earth via their parachute. But, if it is airborne infantry above you, shoot away! Since their mission will be to kill or capture you when their feet reach the ground. For cyber warfare there aren't any rules--yet...\n\nThe issue of \"attribution\" and who is doing what to who seems to be a thorny problem. How do you retaliate if you can't identify who attacked you? Re-purposing of cyber weapons is something that puts a new twist on picking up the bullets just shot at you and throwing them back at the enemy--whoever that might be. The rules of engagement, what to use, when and how will all have to be thought through. I expect there will be some \"trial and error.\" The error part means someone will probably die because a cyber attack went awry.\n\nWe have all heard about collateral damage from aircraft bombing runs. How will that work with cyber warfare? Will it be OK to attack electrical utilities? Who declares \"cyber wars?\" Life is changing rapidly and our old systems are going to have trouble keeping up with the changes, this includes the ethics of what we can do.\n\nChanging subjects for a moment: For instance in the medical field ethics will be the issue dominating future discussions and decisions. Modern medicine will allow us to do or not do many things we could never do before. The allocation of resources will be hotly debated and the ethics of what we might be able to do \"clone?\" are not done being decided.\n\nThis article was printed from:"}
{"text":"The New Zealand Police force has launched a new virtual evidence tool as they celebrate the 25th anniversary of their e-Crime Lab.\n\nThe Environment for Virtualised Evidence (EVE) application was launched at an event in Wellington today.EVE, created by the New Zealand Police Electronic Crime Group, consists of a combination of off-the-shelf software and custom development.\n\nDelivered through a web interface, EVE allows investigators to examine a seized computer or storage device, using search tools or a virtual representation of the device to keep it forensically safe and not put evidence at risk.\n\nDigital forensic examiners faced with a complex inquiry can spend weeks delving into a computer to find the traces of evidence required for a successful prosecution, Police say.\n\nFurther, with the proliferation of computers and storage devices such as mobile phones and PDAs the number of devices seized outweighs the availability of forensic specialists to analyse them.In New Zealand, detectives typically had to wait four to six months for the results of computer forensic analysis, Police say.\n\nThe tool also allows investigators to use a computer as the suspect would have used it.\n\nThe end result is more evidence being recovered, faster and therefore increased numbers of guilty pleas, saving court time, Police say.\n\nEVE, which cost around $500,000, allows functions normally completed by forensic specialists to be shifted to investigators, who are better placed to know what is relevant to an investigation. EVE is also available across New Zealand over the Police network.\n\nThe virtual element means when a case is loaded into EVE, the analyst can choose to convert a computer exhibit into a virtual copy of that computer, resetting the administrator password in the process.\n\nThe detective can then log onto EVE, start the virtual machine and use the computer and any files or applications it contains, as the suspect may have used it."}
{"text":"Impact of Cybercrime on Businesses\n\nIT security is more important for businesses than ever.\n\nA study that was carried out by the Ponemon Institute has revealed that businesses lacking in IT security could be losing over \u00a3200,000. The study, entitled \"Impact of Cybercrime on Businesses\", surveyed 2,618 C-level IT security and executive personnel with the aim of finding out what everyone has in common. The survey spanned the United States, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Brazil and Germany. It was found that in the latter country, cyber-attacks cost businesses more than anywhere else, with the average cost being around $298,359. The average cost that cyber-attacks will have on companies in the United States is $276,671, if they are successfully carried out.\n\nClearly, companies that do not pay adequate attention to their IT security are at risk. Anyone with a computer should make sure that their data is adequately protected, even if they only use it for leisure activities such as playing on partypoker.com or surfing social networking websites like facebook.com. This is because personal data will always become stored on their computers and it is important to avoid that data being accessed. However, it is even more important for businesses to protect themselves against online crime, and the figures from the Ponemon Institute's survey speak for themselves.\n\nFor those who carry out online crime, the aim is mainly financial gain. This type of fraud is the most common motive for cybercrime, with others being the theft of customer data and the disruption of the operations of a business. As well as adequately protecting their computers and online security, those in the workplace should not forget about their personal mobile devices. This includes tablets and smartphones and many companies are implementing training programs to help their employees remain aware of the risk from cyber-attack.\n\nThere are many ways in which internet users can protect themselves from cyber-attack. Change passwords regularly and ensure that they are complicated words, with numbers and symbols if possible. Always sign out of everything when you are finished, whether it is an e-mail account or a social networking site to minimize the risk of hacking. Run regular virus scans on your computer and make sure that your software is up to date. Never give out your personal information to anyone that you do not trust and be generally smart about internet usage. Hopefully this will go a long way to helping prevent cybercrime in the future."}
{"text":"December 6,\n2008: China and Russia are displaying numerous instances of a new phenomenon; cyber-nationalism.\nThis new disease manifests itself when an event, or government propaganda,\nstirs up nationalistic feelings among many Internet users. There then follows\nmuch chatter on message boards, email, messaging and so on. This quickly\nevolves into the organizing of online vigilantes. Nationalistic hackers proceed\nto do damage to any available target of these nationalistic feelings. Often\nthere isn't a target, as in the case of a natural disaster, where the mobilized\nnet users concentrate on helping out. But when the news event involves another\nnation, or person, there follows hacking attacks, of varying degrees of\nintensity, against the designated \"enemy.\"\n\nThe\ngovernments in Russia and China have both \"guided\" this ire at\napproved targets. But since China is still a tightly (more so than Russia)\ncontrolled police state, there is also the risk of the enraged cyber patriots\nturning on the Communist Party. This has already happened a few times, usually\nin response to government corruption or incompetence. This explains why China\nspends so much on software, hardware and staff to gain some control over who\nuses the Internet inside China. Obviously, the ultimate defense against\nuncontrolled cyber-nationalism against the government, is to pull the plug on\nthe Internet. That's a very short term solution, because so much of the economy\ndepends on the Internet. Moreover, there would be a major backlash over this\ntactic.\n\nAs long as\nChina is a communist police state, with a large and growing (half a billion\nusers in a few years, they will remain vulnerable to a revolution that gets\nstarted, not in the streets, but on the net.\n\nIf you want\nto experience the Internet as users inside China do, go to \nScary stuff."}
{"text":"13 Greatest Hackers in History\n\nIn the hacking industry, guys can either be considered good or bad depending on the activities they participate in. There have been notorious hackers that have developed operating systems that really revolutionized the Internet, and there have been guys on the other end of the spectrum who hack into major companies, trying to make millions of dollars by obtaining information or software. Nonetheless, each of the men on this list are extremely talented and their abilities should be recognized\n\n12. |\n\nJohn Draper\n\nJohn Draper was known as a \"phone phreak\" because of his abilities to hack into phone lines and use pay phones free of charge by using a small plastic whistle. The whistle, when having one hole glued shut, induces a clear 2600 Hz tone, the exact sound telephone systems used to indicate a phone call was completed. This allowed him to conduct free long-distance calls since the phone system thought the call was over due to the tone from the whistle.\n\n11. |\n\nGordon Lyon\n\nGordon Lyon is referred to as \"Fyodor\" (the nickname came from a Russian author named Fyodor Dostoyevsky) on the Internet, and is considered one of the \"good\" hackers in the industry. He doesn't involve him self in crime, and is constantly attempting to enhance online security for the well-being of Internet users all over the world. In 1997, Lyon was responsible for developing the Nmap Security Scanner, which discovers hosts and various services on a given computer network. He also owns his own websites and business, has written several books and articles, and was the President of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.\n\n10. |\n\nRobert Morris\n\nRobert Morris is known as the first hacker to release a worm virus into the digital world, eventually infecting over 6,000 computers owned by the military and various university computers across the country. His intent wasn't to harm any of these machines, but he tried gaining access to them, including federal government systems. After the last of the worm destruction was finished, the estimated worth of all the damage done was as high as $10 million. Luckily for Morris, he got off with just a $10,500 fine and 400 hours of community service.\n\n9. |\n\nTsutomu Shimomura\n\nTo be the best you have to beat the best, and Shimomura did just that. After having his computer hacked by infamous super-hacker Kevin Mitnick, Tsutomu decided to join the FBI in tracking his rival down. He finger-hacked his cellphone and listened in on calls at Capitol Hill while federal agents were overseeing him. Shimomura reportedly used a cellular frequency from an antenna on a laptop that allowed him to almost pinpoint Mitnick's position. Since then, books and movies have been produced from this thrilling story.\n\n8. |\n\nRichard Stallman\n\nRichard Stallman was the mind behind the free operating system named GNU. Millions of people use it today, and it's all because of Stallman and his movement to making operating systems entirely free. He was part of the MIT AI Lab, but quit it when he started focusing on his GNU project so that they couldn't claim any copyrights to the software. Stallman went on to earn eight awards including being elected into the United States National Academy of Engineering.\n\n7. |\n\nDouglas Engelbart\n\nMr. Engelbart is responsible for the computer mouse, computer video teleconferencing, hypermedia, email, the Internet, and windows, all of which are being used today. He had a lab at the Augmentation Research Center at the Stanford Research Institute where he participated in his cyberspace activities. Basically, without Engelbart, there would be no Internet hacking at all, so he could be considered the grandfather of it all.\n\n6. |\n\nAdrian Lamo\n\nAdrian Lamo may have the greatest resume in terms of major corporations that he was able to get information from. He broke into the computer networks of Microsoft, Yahoo!, Citigroup, Bank of America, Cingular, and The New York Times. He used to use Internet connections at local Kinkos or coffee shops to hack into company security systems, and would then inform the business of their security flaws.\n\n5. |\n\nKevin Poulson\n\nKevin Poulson was a well-rounded hacker, but he was known for his extraordinary telephone line hacking skills. He started his journey by reactivating aged Yellow Page escort phone numbers for one of his acquaintances who wanted to run a virtual escort agency. When he did this, as well as hack into the FBI database and federal computers, his name was the focus on NBC's Unsolved Mysteries. When he realized he was wanted, NBC's phone lines went down and were unusable. Coincidence? Poulson also used his amazing talents to hack into the phone lines of radio stations so he could undoubtedly make himself the qualified caller to win the prize, where he won a nice Porsche, as well as other prizes.\n\n4. |\n\nVladimir Levin\n\nVladimir is the stereotypical hacker, as he used his knowledge of the concept to gain access to a list of Citibank user codes and passwords. He used this information to transfer over $3.5 million via wire transferring to his group accounts in several countries. He was eventually caught and sent to prison, while having to repay Citibank over $200,000.\n\n3. |\n\nLinus Torvalds\n\nMuch like Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds developed an open-source operating system that is still in use today. Linus absolutely hated the operating system, MS-DOS, that was being used for Microsoft computers, so he started Linux, sent it to a few other programmers to tinker with and improve, and major companies took notice of its potential. Numerous companies started selling versions of Linux for their own benefit, becoming a huge breakthrough for computers.\n\n2. |\n\nJonathan James\n\nAs a 16-year-old kid, Jonathan James was enjoying the challenge of hacking and participating in activities no other kid his age had ever experienced before. Jonathan went big early, as he hacked into impressively large organizations like NASA and an agency of the Department of the Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency.\n\nFrom the latter, he only received usernames and passwords of some of the members in the organization and read through extremely confidential emails. Then came NASA, where he stole software that controlled the temperature of the physical environment inside the International Space Station. They were forced to power off the entire network because of the hacking done by Jonathan.\n\n1. |\n\nKevin Mitnick\n\nKevin Mitnick is the most well-known hacker to ever live, as well as the most feared because of what he was capable of. Highly touted as \"the most wanted computer criminal in United States history\" and \"the most dangerous hacker in the world,\" Mitnick went from a phone hacker into a full-out hacking menace. He used his cellphone to gain access to computers by touch-tone and voice control. At one point he was able to manipulate the Motorola network. He had to brach four thick layers of cyber security to get in, but e eventually did and had unlimited access to the company's internal network. He was capable of ultimately anything he wanted to get into, but he actually believed it was immoral and unethical, so he slowed down up until the point he got caught."}
{"text":"Mobile Hackers are on the Rise\n\nSmartphones and mobile devices are becoming a tempting target for hackers. And not the good hackers (developers who \"hack\" constructive things like data sets and platforms), but malicious hackers \u2014 the ones who produce malware, steal information and harm your computer. Or, increasingly, your mobile device.\n\nA Mobile Threats Report from the Juniper Networks revealed that the amount of malware created for mobile devices across all operating systems more than doubled in 2011. Most of it was spyware \u2014 the stuff that steals your information. More than 63 percent of the malware found could track a phone's location and collect financial information.\n\nLast August, The New York Times reported that Android is the number one operating system targeted by hackers, mostly because Google does not use a vetting process to monitor new mobile apps. Apple demands that each app in the app store be approved, so it's more secure, though not perfect.\n\nAnd apps aren't the only way hackers can target your mobile device. Dangerous Trojans can be sent via text message. Juniper reported that 36 percent of malware found were Trojans sent via SMS. And ambitious hackers can create QR codes that lead to infected mobile sites.\n\nTo protect yourself, be sure to download apps only if you know they are legitimate, and do your research. Check out these tips from PCWorld to avoid infected apps. Also, be careful to scan only QR codes from a source you trust. And if you're building QR code campaigns, make sure to indicate where the QR code will take a user once they've scanned it."}
{"text":"March 18, 2013 10:05 am\n\nIn your inbox, there might be a there's a prince in Africa who needs your help, a cash award you just won for a contest that you never entered and a Russian woman who wants to meet you. Where do all these spam messages come from? According to the BBC, mostly from the same place:\n\nOf the 42,201 ISPs studied about 50% of all junk mail, phishing attacks and other malicious messages came from just 20 networks, [Giovane Cesar Moreira Moura] found. Many of these networks were concentrated in India, Vietnam and Brazil. On the net's most crime-ridden network \u2013 Spectranet in Nigeria \u2013 62% of all the addresses controlled by that ISP were seen to be sending out spam.\n\nIt's hard to know exactly where many of those emails came from, because people fishing for information with spam often route their traffic through other networks to avoid getting caught. But Moreira Moura, the researcher behind the work, believes that starting to track spam could identify what he calls \"bad neighborhoods\" online. He writes in his dissertation:\n\nThe goal of this dissertation is to investigate Bad Neighborhoods on the Internet. The idea behind the Internet Bad Neighborhood concept is that the probability of a host in behaving badly increases if its neighboring hosts (i.e., hosts within the same subnetwork) also behave badly. This idea, in turn, can be exploited to improve current Internet security solutions, since it provides an indirect approach to predict new sources of attacks (neighboring hosts of malicious ones).\n\nAnd rather than focusing on individual bad neighbors, he says, it's far easier and more accurate to pinpoint neighborhoods. He writes:\n\nAnother finding of this dissertation is that Internet Bad Neighborhoods are much less stealthy than individual hosts, since they are more likely to strike again a target previously attacked. We found that, in a one-week period, nearly 50% of the individual IP addresses attack only once a particular target, while up to 90% of the Bad Neighborhoods attacked more than once. Consequently, this implies that historical data of Bad Neighborhoods attacks can potentially be successfully employed to predict future attacks.\n\nThe next step is to build better tools for computer security experts to be able to see where spam is coming from. If a message comes from a pre-identified bad neighborhood, security experts could build that into their screening process and look at those messages more carefully"}

{"text":"The US government said Wednesday it plans to digitally sign the internet's root zone by the end of the year, a move that would end years of inaction securing the internet's most important asset.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) said it was turning to ICANN, or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, and VeriSign to implement the measure, which is known as DNSSEC. In October, the two organizations submitted separate proposals that offered sharply contrasting visions for putting the complicated framework in place.\n\n\"The parties are working on an interim approach to deployment, by year's end, of a security technology - Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) - at the authoritative root zone (i.e., the address book) of the internet,\" a statement issued by the NTIA read. \"There will be further consultations with the internet technical community as the testing and implementation plans are developed.\"\n\nThe statement left many unanswered questions about the roll-out, most notably the specific roles of the two organizations. It also omitted details about exactly how far the temporary solution would go and when a permanent fix can be expected.\n\nThe answers to such questions are crucial given known vulnerabilities in today's DNS. Last year, researcher Dan Kaminsky of security firm IOActive demonstrated a simple way to plant fraudulent entries in the root zone, which serves as the authoritative document for routing email, web requests, and other internet traffic. The bug had the potential to destroy trust as we know it on the net because it provided a low-cost way for criminals to hijack the websites of banks, government agencies, and similarly sensitive organizations.\n\nBy August, the majority of the world's DNS servers had been updated to resist Kaminsky's DNS cache-poisoning bug, but he warned the move was a temporary band-aid rather than a permanent solution.\n\nDNSSEC is designed to fix that. It affixes a cryptographic seal to results returned from a DNS server to ensure that they haven't been forged. At the heart of the hierarchical DNS is the root zone, which contains the list of servers authorized to provide lookups for each top-level domain such as .com or .gov.\n\nIn its current form, DNSSEC has existed for about a decade but has yet to be implemented, largely due to the complexity and geopolitical tensions surrounding management of the unwieldy technology. Of particular importance is management of the root key because it controls the topmost tier of the hierarchy. Should it ever fall into the wrong hands, the internet could cease to function.\n\nUnder the interim solution, VeriSign will manage the root-signing key and ICANN will manage a separate key-signing key, Paul Levins, vice president of corporate affairs for ICANN told The Register.\n\nUnder last year's proposals, ICANN and VeriSign offered competing arguments why each should manage the root key. (The proposals and public comments responding to them are here.) Representatives from VeriSign didn't return phone calls seeking comment, and an NTIA spokesman declined to confirm ICANN's account.\n\n\"This is big,\" said Bart Forbes, the NTIA spokesman. \"It's not something we do quickly, but we need to socialize whatever decision is made and make sure everyone is on board.\"\n\nHe declined to elaborate on the process the NTIA will use to seek feedback from members of the internet technical community.\n\nICANN is the non-profit group that was established in the late 1990s to oversee the internet's address system. VeriSign operates a wide range of businesses, including management of two of the internet's root-name servers and several businesses that manage digital certificates.\n\nWhile Kaminsky and other experts claim DNSSEC is crucial for securing the internet, not everyone is so sure. Among then is Paul Mockapetris, inventor of DNS. He has long argued that widespread adoption of DNSSEC will be marred by the cost involved and incompatibilities across different systems.\n\n\"To paraphrase Neil Armstrong, this is one giant step for DNSSEC and one small step for the internet,\" said Mockapetris, who is chairman and chief scientist for Nominum, which sells DNS servers to service providers and telecos. \"This will get us on the road to finding out if DNSSEC will work or not, but it's not going to revolutionize things anytime soon. \u00ae\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nBreaking the key?\n\nHow would anyone need to break any key to break DNSSec?\n\nTypical short-sighted gizmo-lovers, believing that the security of a system is this of it's stronger element. Hey, I've got whole-disk encryption, the key is a SuperSecureGaranteedUnbreakable Version 67 hash (4GB) stored on a stick labelled \"enc. key\" that sits on top of the machine. You'd need trillions of trillions years and more energy than is contained in the whole universe to break in. Or 30 seconds. Which is it?\n\nYou can get as strong a key as you want (which, dear AC, means NO MD5). It won't change a thing.\n\nAnyway my point was that DNSSec would probably be broken very fast, if any bad guy really cared (the important part being that no-one is going to even remotely think about it. Because it has strictly no interest for a black hat.). The only people interested will be white hats, for the fame and glory (it means money).\n\nNow deploy DNSSec all you want. It's certainly not going to make the internet any more secure. Hopefully it won't make it any *less* secure. And it certainly has the potential to make it *a lot* less neutral. Actually there's almost no way it's not completely and thoroughly abused and raped. Same as anti-terror laws used to chase fly-tippers and the like.\n\nSame good old method: make up a fantastic (in all the meanings) threat, take \"vigorous\" action resulting in a \"totally legitimate\" landgrab. That's how the US annexed Iraq, that's how anti-paedo laws are used against, well, pretty much anyone including those they are supposed to protect, that's how your council can spy on you and how the plods can steal you camera for no good reason. That's also, closest to the point, how Arkansas got a bunch of oversea-based websites' domain names handed to them...\n\n@Robert Harrison\n\nMD5 has been broken, now that people can create bogus HTTPS certificates which validate using MD5. So web browsers recently had to be updated to not accept MD5 signatures as valid, rendering invalid MD5 based certificates not by then updated. SHA is a family of hash algorithms,  currently going up to SHA512, likely one of the strongest currently known in widespread use. Some earlier SHA versions are now thought to have weaknesses, though probably not yet as readily exploitable as MD5 now is.\n\nWhat having a signed DNSSEC root creating a heirarchical global PKI for the first time will mean is that much more attention will be given to the strength of the algorithms used, resulting incorrespondingly more fame and fortune for whoever publishes successful attacks.\n\nWe will never know that a particular algorithm is secure, we only know when published insecurities exist. What can be said about their security, for algorithms developed within the public domain, is what it would be worth to the person who succeeds in breaking it and publishing a feasible attack, from which we can estimate the amount of talented effort directed towards doing so without published success. (For the paranoid, we don't known what the NSA and GCHQ knows about unpublished weaknesses, but we can still assume their budgets for maintaining the loyalty of those who do know to keep this knowledge secret is finite. We can also assume they can only use their top secret knowledge for attacks of high enough value to them that these justify the risks of leaking this knowledge in the process of using it. )\n\nIn the past attracting this kind of effort has required large prizes on offer to the first successful published attack. But we will need be in no doubt about the fame and fortune that will come to a cryptanalyst who can publish a paper which describes a feasible attack breaking the algorithms used to sign the DNSSEC root.\n\nRoot key security\n\nAccording to AEP Networks (HSM vendor), ICANN's using FIPS140-2 level 4 devices for key storage and signing so the root keys should be as secure as is feasibly possible claiming to be \"a sealed, designed-for-purpose unit with no moving parts. It runs an embedded operating system...\"\n\nSo at least they're not in keys.txt on a Windows XP PC. More like on a physically secure device accessed by multiple security personnel, in a physically secure room, in a physically secure building."}

If you don't think you've been discovered, but you have, then the defenders have some good opportunities.

It's just the government advocating reasonable measure even though I'm sure they knew they'd get pilloried for it. I rarely respect the DHS, but in this case I may make an exception.\n\nNo; real world equivalent; there are a bunch of possible terrorists wandering around the airport carrying things that look like bombs but you don't know if they really are or how they are triggered. Your visiting security experts have identified a few of them but you know there are many more. You quickly work out that the terrorists can go in and out of the building at will completely bypassing the security gate and have been doing so for weeks on end, but you don't know how. You tell the guy in charge of the security thugs at the door not to alert the terrorists until you have time to get back up and hopefully wait for a quieter gap between flight arrivals."}
{"text":"The OPP Anti-Rackets Branch says 'ransomware' has been around since 2006\nbut only surfaced in Canada in late-2011 as well as in Europe and\nAustralia.

The ransomware produces what has been\ncalled a \"Police Trojan\" or \"scareware\" because a notice pops up that\nappears to come from a law enforcement agency, such as the Canadian\nSecurity Intelligence Service and\/or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nThe message is a false accusation of accessing child pornography or\nother file-sharing websites and subsequently tells the consumer that\n$100 needs to be paid via money transfer or credit card to unlock the\ncomputer.

It will also be customized for the recipient.\n\nFor example, \"if you are in the sales department, it will ask for information about products,\" Alperovitch said.\n\nOnce you open the attachment or click on the link, a vulnerability in the system's application such as a word processor or browser will be exploited. Malicious software, known as malware, will then start executing on the machine and open up a communication channel to the hacker to allow them to browse and control the system.\n\nHackers can also use the infected computer \"as a beachhead to get into other machines within that network,\" he said.\n\nAlperovitch said that's how cyber spies were able to hack into Google last year."}

It is somehow a layered threat and hinders the access to the site in following different ways\n\nVulnerable Zoombies Attacks: A DDoS attack directs hundreds or even thousands of compromised \"zombie\" hosts against a single target. These zombies are unintentionally recruited from the millions of unprotected computers accessing the Internet through high-bandwidth or always-on connections. By planting \"sleeper\" codes on these machines, hackers can quickly build a legion of zombies, all waiting for the command to launch a DDoS attack. With enough zombie hosts participating, the volume of an attack can be astounding. DDoS Threats Over the last few years, attackers have refined their methods. As developers make software more reliable and more resilient to DoS, the attack vectors have changed to target hard-to-secure parts of a service.\n\nBandwidth and Traffic Bottlenecks: A server that has a bandwidth of 100 Mbit\/s can easily be attacked by a DoS attack with a machine that has a little more bandwidth than this which will make it loss packets and finally will make it unusable. This creates bottle necks for other site surfers and will make the server itself dormant.\n\nSYN Attacks: SYN (synchronous) stacks are becoming frequent nowadays. This attack can prevent access to your mailbox, WWW and other critical servers. The SYN attack (sometimes referred as SYN flood attack) sends TCP connections requests faster than a machine can process them. The SYN attacker creates a random source address for each packet and sets the SYN flag in each packet. Victim responds to spoofed IP address, then waits for confirmation that never arrives. Victim's connection table fills up waiting for replies. After table fills up, all new connections and legitimate users are ignored. Once attacker stops flooding server, it usually goes back to normal state (SYN floods rarely crash servers).\n\nMaking Applications Flawed: DDoS attacks do not only attack over the network layer but the their inscrutable nature is that they even make the applications malfunctioning.

{"text":"Father Antonio Spadero wrote an article for the Civilta Cattolica that lauds the spirit of hacking. Hackers were vilified in the media during the 1990s. Because of that treatment the word hacker took on a different meaning as it spread into the common vernacular. This popular usage made hacker synonymous with computer criminal. Today, this is changing, and this article stands by the original, correct, and untarnished meaning of the word.\n\nNote here, neither I nor Fr. Spadero are using the term to mean computer crime or internet vandalism or whatever else the plebian media are deciding to use the word hacker for today. I stand by the original definition of hacker and hacking. I even like the neologism, hacktivist.\n\nI must link to this as well, just in case one person hasn't read The Mentor's famous manifesto. It brings a nostalgic tear to my eye just scanning through it again. There's a scene in Hackers where two cops read through this manifesto, which is why it's such a famous piece.\n\nThe Jesuit priest, a literary critic and technology expert, also cited Tom Pittman, a member of California's Homebrew Computer Club, as an example of someone seeking a creative fusion of Christianity and technology.\n\n\"I as a Christian thought I could feel something of the satisfaction that God must have felt when He created the world,\" Pittman wrote of his work. Christian hackers, Spadaro said, viewed their work as \"a form of participation in the 'work' of God in creation.\"- TechWorld\n\nMost importantly, this opens a lot of important theological questions.

{"text":"The internet is abuzz with warnings about the proposed CISPA legislation - HR 3523. As with a lot of legislation, this bill is well intentioned, but not helpful.\n\nThis particular bill is also emblematic of the confusion and ignorance that pervades conversation about internet issues.\n\nThe motivation for this federal legislation is the powerful urge being felt by those who don't understand the internet to have a \"coordinated\" authority tracking and monitoring \"critical infrastructure\" that could in theory be damaged or destroyed by a \"cyber attack\". Some people believe that if there is no federal agency \"regulating\", we are vulnerable.\n\nThe thrust of CISPA is to allow federal agencies to share information about \"cyber threats\". Current law is complex and not entirely clear. CISPA is 16 pages of provisions allowing certain entities to share certain kinds of information with certain other entities under certain circumstances, other laws notwithstanding. (It does not directly threaten anyone's privacy, as some suggest)\n\nIs that clear?\n\nFirst of all, \"cyber attacks\" are not the big mushroom-cloud events that you see in the movies. They take the form of hundreds or thousands of attempts to guess your password, or generating ill-formed requests to a web server, or spewing out \"poisoned\" packets on the internet. There are many forms and types, but they are not at all rare. They are as common as mosquitoes. I have many thousands of these \"attacks\" on my computer servers every week. I have to be careful to monitor my servers to ensure that these \"attacks\" are not successful. That is part of my job, and there is absolutely nothing that the federal government can or should do to fix it.\n\nSecondly, the idea that information sharing and monitoring by federal agencies will prevent the \"next big cyber attack\" is silly. It's much like the idea that the folks at the SEC can prevent the stock market from crashing. No one is that smart. The hackers who launch these attacks are like the mosquitoes. They are everywhere, and constantly probing for weaknesses. We may as well pass a federal law banning shoplifting.\n\nLike shoplifting, \"cyber attacks\" are a fact of life in a world with worldwide anonymous connectivity. Like shoplifting, it is the responsibility of each computer owner, administrator, or manager to take appropriate steps to ensure that important data is secure. There is an entire industry segment devoted to anti-virus and security issues. PC security software is widely available. This is not a crisis, nor even a major problem. It is part of the price we pay for internet freedom.\n\nThere are places in the world where shoplifting is rare. In those places, merchants keep customers in the lobby behind a fence, and if the customers want to see an item, the item is brought from the back room, and shown to the customer. The customer is only permitted to actually touch the item under close supervision.\n\nIn the same way, computers can be put behind a screen, and users permitted access only under tight supervision. This has been tried by certain repressive regimes.\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur said: \"There is no security in this life, only opportunity\". We must stop turning to government to solve every problem - real or imagined, as though we can somehow achieve ultimate security. The internet is not \"broken\", and all the federal \"oversight\" in the world will not \"fix\" it. I, for one, do not want the federal government to even try."}
{"text":"New Members\n\nOver the last decade, I have seen computer hacking evolve from being a competitive sport to becoming a destructive arm of organized crime. The magazine, Wired, recently highlighted several high profile hacking cases where identity theft or impersonation played key roles. Once the domain of the stereotypical \"lone geek,\" more recent security breaches can be attributed to an older generation of international hackers who offer their skills to the highest bidder. These mercenaries no longer target individuals or small organizations. Instead, their prime targets are companies that have the highest potential for loot, with payment processing companies and banks at the top of their hit list.\n\nFor every high profile breach that hits the news, there are several that go undetected. This game of chess between the attackers (black hats) and the security experts (white hats) has been going on for years. The tools both sides use to attack and defend have become much more advanced, but the most common are still SQL injection and DNS redirection. Sometimes the white hats come out on top by removing any holes for the black hats to exploit. In these situations, black hats will use brute force to take down servers by hijacking legitimate users computers.\n\nLike the ever-multiplying Agent Smith in the final Matrix sequel, growing numbers of ordinary computers in an organization can increase the possibility of a successful security breach even in the most secure server environments. These botnets, as they are called, can number in the thousands and the owners of these infected computers are completely unaware of their role in the electronic warfare being waged against their company. Black hats spend weeks or months amassing large botnets by setting up malware traps on high traffic web where hosted content is not adequately protected.\n\nPracticing safe and common sense web surfing is the best way to avoid letting your computer become a zombie drone. Maintaining up to date security software is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, common sense security practices are not so common. For example, using the same password to access both confidential and non-confidential information drastically increases your risk of being hacked. Another common mistake is throwing away your old hard drive when it fails or when upgrading to a new one.\n\nThe last example is a poor security choice for several reasons. When a drive is thrown away or sold, the data can be recovered and read by someone other than the original owner, even on a failed drive. This is an enormous security hole that can come back to haunt you. Many companies eliminate this risk by using industrial shredders to physically destroy unwanted drives.\n\nInstead of destroying these drives, choosing to keep them can provide you with additional backup in case your regimented backup schedule fails in some way while simultaneously increasing data security at a relatively low cost.\n\nWhile regular computer users have a lower threat of being hacked, they are very susceptible to identity theft and there is no easier way for your personal data to be obtained than from your old hard drive purchased on eBay or found in a recycle bin.\n\nAlthough 100%, hack-free security isn't possible, taking just the suggestions mentioned above will greatly reduce both you and your companies risk of very costly and highly damaging security breaches."}

{"text":"Careers in Computer Forensics\n\nFrom corporate theft to murder, computers often play a role in nefarious activity, requiring specialists with a mix of legal and technical expertise to gather evidence stored digitally.\n\n\"If it's a crime, a computer can be a component of it,\" says Mike Finnie, a digital forensics specialist with Computer Forensics Inc.\n\nEven if the computer is not the instrument of the crime, it may contain evidence of illegalities. As PCs, PDAs and other computer-based devices become pervasive in work and personal lives, it's no surprise they often play a role in illegal behavior.\n\nWanted: Legal and Investigative Skills\n\nSpecialists in this field, known as computer forensics, combine technical expertise with investigative skills and in-depth knowledge of the legal system. The field's techniques are used not just by law-enforcement agencies but also in the corporate world for investigations into workplace improprieties as well as potentially illegal behavior.\n\nOpportunities for technology professionals to break into computer forensics have increased, but many organizations still prize specialists with law-enforcement experience that includes work for local or state police, the FBI or the Secret Service. \"Almost invariably, the best forensic examiners are current or former law-enforcement officers, either federal or local,\" says John McElhatton of JMac Enterprises, a firm offering computer forensic services. \"The necessary investigative skills are already in place.\"\n\nTech Crime-Scene Pitfalls\n\nTechnology professionals not trained in computer forensics will almost certainly cause problems in investigations, according to experts in the field. Countless investigations have been stymied by well-intended techies eager to gather evidence yet unaware their efforts may end up altering data, thus foiling the chances for a successful inquiry or prosecution.\n\nEven top-notch network administrators, says McElhatton, may \"step on the potential evidence out of ignorance of forensic and evidence-handling protocols.\"\n\nComputer Forensics Training\n\nTraining is now available to professionals working outside law enforcement, opening up the field to techies willing to learn the analytical, communication and legal skills necessary to work in computer forensics.\n\nBut techies should still consider whether they have the traits needed to succeed in the industry.\n\nRick Van Luvender, president of InfoSec Academy, says computer forensics specialists must be detail-oriented and able to carry themselves with poise, especially when faced with questions from opposing counsel in a courtroom. \"You need to treat every piece of evidence you collect as if it will be presented in court,\" he says.\n\nOthers concur, emphasizing the need for techies to communicate their findings to nontechnical workers, including attorneys, judges and juries. \"It doesn't do any good to start talking hexadecimal to a jury,\" says Finnie.\n\nGiven the newness of the field, titles are still in flux, but job listings may be posted under titles such as forensics examiner, computer investigator or computer forensic specialist.\n\nSpecialized software in the field is offered by Guidance Software and New Technologies, among other companies, but training in investigative protocols is considered more important than knowledge of specific software.\n\nTraining programs may be particularly appealing to independent computer consultants, says Van Luvender. Many companies are unable to employ forensics experts or may be wary about having one employee investigate a colleague. Such companies typically will hire a consultant when a problem arises.\n\nWhile the bar may be high to enter computer forensics, the rewards are unique. \"Every case is different,\" says McElhatton. \"It is very challenging and rewarding to crack a case using a combination of investigative and technical skills"}
{"text":"Prediction: Handful of Malicious Networks Will Spawn Most Attacks In 2012\n\nA shadowy web of malicious networks, or \"malnets\" will be the source of two thirds of online attacks in 2012, according to a report from the security firm Blue Coat.\n\nDespite the continued industry focus on specific families and samples of malicious software, Blue Coat researchers say that identifying the common components of a handful of underlying infection infrastructures, which they are referring to as 'malnets,' is a more promising approach to stopping further infections.\n\nThe company's 2011 State of the Threat Landscape report identifies five principle malnets: Shnakule, Glomyn, Cavka, Naargo, and Cinbric. Blue Coat describes Malnets as distributed network infrastructures designed to sweep up victims while they browse trusted Web sites and route them through the malnets: forwarding them along from a legitimate (but compromised) Web site through relay servers and on to exploit and payload servers. Blue Coat believes that nearly two-thirds of all attacks in 2012 will originate from these and other known malnets. The company's researchers hope to exploit these networks by identifying common components within them and then using that information to mitigate threats before they become active.\n\nAnalysis of the malnets has revealed them to be complex, with complex links between an infected site using a search engine optimized attack, such as those linked to the death of Steve Jobs. Behind that site lies a complicated, interconnected network that allows online criminals to stay one step ahead of black lists and other security measures by launching the same attack on another site seamlessly directing users to it, according to Chris Larsen, Senior Malware Researcher at Blue Coat.\n\nMalnets make tools like blacklists and signature based threat detection less effective, Larsen said. However, they do give vendors the opportunity to more thoroughly detect threats at an earlier stage \u2013 in some cases even before attacks have been launched.\n\nBlue Coat said it is looking at ways to block attacks by determining variables that are reasonably constant across the malnet such as domain name similarities.\n\nLarsen said that his company's data shows that organized crime groups and malicious hackers are sticking with what works when launching online attacks. Despite an overall decline in e-mail use, attacks via e-mail increased by nearly five per cent from the first half of the year and continue to be a large problem. Attacks launched from search-engine optimized Web sites were the most common entry point for malicious code. Search engine poisoning accounts for some 40 per cent of infection, Blue Coat found. At the same time, Social networking is moving up as a mlaware entry point. Now accounting for almost 6.5 per cent of infections, the report said.\n\nLarson believes that the continued prevalence and success of search engine poisoning as a method of infection is evidence that we are doing a poor job of communicating the dangers of search. Too often, he said, users will trust a link just because it popped up as a top search result. Instead, users need to inspect urls and make sure they are safe before following links.\n\nWebsite certificates with verifyable thumbprint lookup maybe at the DNS server level seems like a big roadblock in the bad guys highway\u2026 Why is this such a \"difficult\" problem?\n\nSometimes simple solutions are very difficult to see when very smart people forget to step back and look at very small concepts.

{"text":"Public Transport card fully hacked\n\nWhat experts foresaw last December and the Dutch research institute TNO denies was possible in their recent report has been done. The deepest level of data-encryption on the NXP Mifare RFID chip has been hacked. Cash from cards can now be copied to other cards through cloning and that makes this system utterly unsuitable for serious applications involving real people and real money.\n\nBut this is essentially old news. The more interesting news as far as I'm concerned is the fact that TNO was immediately re-hired by the company implementing the card system to do more research on the validity of the hack. You have to wonder what the thinking is here. This company dropped the ball on at least three separate occasions in this area so why do they get another chance to write a big rapport to claim 'there is no problem' ? And this is not the first time, on the sensitive subject of voting computers (now banned in The Netherlands) they also kept telling us 'all is well'.\n\nIf you merely want a paper to reassure yourself just ask the secretary to print out a pretty picture from the Interweb with a caption that says 'everything will be ok'. That's a lot cheaper then hiring a company like TNO, and apparently just as valid.\n\nDoes TNO just write down whatever the customer asks of them or do they really not know any better? Either alternative is troublesome. As an important expert-adviser to the governments we should hold TNO to a higher standard. When faced with an impossible request from a client they should respectfully decline the job explain that the client's request is either technically impossible or not in line with laws concerning citizen privacy and such.\n\nOur government (and parliament!) allowing such organizations to indirectly guide technology policy is a real problem that will continue to cost us dearly (in real money, privacy violations, theft and missed technology opportunities).\n\nNext up for big IT-projects is a road-toll system that should allow for more flexible costs of (pay-as-you-go) owning and using a car.

Do not use your mobile phone to communicate with strangers. Only text and call people or businesses you know in real life.\n\nNever reply to text messages from people you don't know.\n\nMake sure you know how to block others from calling your phone. Using caller id you can block all incoming calls or block individual names and numbers.\n\nMake a record of your Electronic Serial Number (ESN) and\/or your International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. You can find out your IMEI number by pressing *#06# on your mobile phone's keypad, it will display a 15 digit number - that is your IMEI number.\n\nIf your phone is lost or stolen, report it to your local police station and your network operator immediately.\n\nThink about how a text message might be read before you send it.\n\nYou should never give anyone else's number out without asking them if it is okay.\n\nYou should never take pictures or videos of anyone with your phone if you do not have their permission.\n\nDo not allow others to take pictures or videos of you without your permission. Remember \u2013 these pictures and videos can be posted to the Internet.\n\nBe careful if you meet someone in real life who you only \"know\" through text messaging. Even though text messaging is often the \"next step\" after online chatting, that does not mean that it is safer."}

{"text":"share this story\n\nFor corporations, the threat of data breach is more dangerous than ever--but, according to a new study, most companies still do not take the measures needed to keep their information secure, nor are they always up front with their customers about security breaches.\n\nA recent study by McAfee, a vendor of cyber security products, took a look into the ins and outs of cybersecurity when it comes to protecting corporate data, outlining the difficulties companies face while securing information. McAfee, it should be noted, has a fiscal interest in seeing companies beef up their cybersecurity defenses as it sells services and tools that guard against data breaches. Their study, \"Underground Economies: Intellectual Capital and Sensitive Corporate Data Now the Latest Cybercrime Currency\" surveyed over 1,000 senior IT professionals in the U.S., U.K., Japan, China, India, Brazil and the Middle East.\n\nDespite the danger of losing corporate intellectual capital or customer information to cybercriminals, it appears that companies have not always been vigilant about trying to improve security, even following successful attacks. Of all the organizations that had experienced a data breach, only half undertook actions to fix and protect their systems from later break-ins. A quarter of companies assess the risks to their data twice a year, or less.\n\nThese breaches have come at a cost: the research found that a quarter of organizations had a merger\/acquisition or new product roll-out slowed or even stopped by a data breach or the threat of breach. Perhaps as a result, in China, Japan, U.K. and the U.S., companies spend more than $1 million a day on their IT.\n\nBut not many companies actually report suffering data breaches. Three in ten firms report all data breaches, with the majority, or six in ten companies, \"picking and choosing\" what breaches they share. Recently, Mozilla expressed its regret over failing to disclose a breach involving stolen SSL certificates for sites including GMail, Skype, Yahoo Mail and more. The attack was suspected to involve the work of the Iranian government.\n\nMcAfee notes the report \"also shows that organizations may seek out countries with more lenient disclosure laws, with eight in ten organizations that store sensitive information abroad influenced by privacy laws requiring notification of data breaches to customers.\" And the biggest hassle may be yet to come, as the rise of devices like tablets and smartphones presents an as yet unsolved challenge for locking down information securely.\n\nNegligence could prove even more problematic in the face of changes in the way companies are storing data. Economic troubles have caused more and more companies to look into processing data outside of their native country, with half of companies surveyed indicating they would be open to doing so. Some countries are seen as safer than others when it comes to data storage. While Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. lead the pack for perceived safety, China, Russia and Pakistan are seen to be the least safe.\n\nFor corporations, the threat of data breach is more dangerous than ever--but, according to a new study, most companies still do not take the measures needed to keep their information secure, nor are t...\n\nFor corporations, the threat of data breach is more dangerous than ever--but, according to a new study, most companies still do not take the measures needed to keep their information secure, nor are t...\n\nI feel sorry for anyone trying to find out more on about the latter part of this story that says the US gov suspects Iran (the IP address originated in Iran and that is all they know, so it could have been anyone), Other than the link to Mozilla's expression of regret it isn't going to be easy find out much based on this story's content.\n\nRelevant to democracy breaking out in the Middle East and relevant to Iran is another big story about how the Iranian government found a work around of Tor's anonymity network (which is supposed to disassociate the user's IP address from the content of their communication) by scraping Tor and linking the user's IP address with the time (in milliseconds) the content was put on the network.

{"text":"Vigilance is the only realistic defence in cyber war\n\nThe Ministry of Defence is recruiting hundreds of new cyber specialists, while the Pentagon has decided that an attack on US computer networks from another country may be deemed an act of war, meriting an armed response. Both moves are merely acknowledgement that the internet, once considered a background support system, is now a front line of modern conflict, both commercial and military.\n\nOnce the phenomenon was a curiosity, lending itself to a film such as the 1983 Wargames, about a teenage hacker who breaks into a Pentagon supercomputer and almost unleashes World War III. Today, the threat is perhaps less dramatic but more dangerous and complicated. Cyber attacks are pernicious, pervasive, and constant. The past 12 months have seen well-publicised assaults on Google, Sony, and Lockheed Martin, the largest US defence contractor. But a myriad others go unreported.\n\nCyber attacks have two main purposes: to steal and to disrupt. The former, exemplified by the Lockheed Martin incident, is but a 21st-century version of espionage, the world's second oldest profession. The second, as the Pentagon's new approach underlines, is war by other means. Imagine, for instance, the devastating impact of an invisible cyber bomb that took out the electricity grids of London or the north-east US for any length of time. The problem is how to deal with such attacks.\n\nRetaliation, whether in kind or otherwise, is clearly one response \u2013 but against whom?. Consider the 2010 Stuxnet computer worm attack that disrupted Iran's suspected nuclear arms programme: perish the thought that the US and\/or Israel had anything to do with it. The source of a cyber attack can be hard to pin down: is it a malicious hacker, a corporate rival, a terrorist group, or a national government? In other words, is it mischief, or is it war?\n\nA better response might be reinforced international co-operation, perhaps an international convention. But given the nature of the cyber-beast, that is akin to trying to corral the wind. The only realistic defence is constant vigilance. Cyber wars are likely to become even more pernicious and pervasive in the future.\n\nBuy the new Independent eBook - \u00a31.99 A celebration of those who risk their lives for women's rights, a century after Emily Wilding Davison's death."}

{"text":"Is there such a thing as a \"Digital doomsday device\"?\n\nThe FBI decided they had to assault the Dotcom Compound in Australia with massive power, and speed because they believed that Kim Dotcom had a \"Digital Doomsday Device\" that would instantly erase servers around the world.\n\nMr Wormald said he was told by the FBI that Dotcom \"carried a device with him to delete servers around the world\". Earlier evidence stated no such device was ever found.\n\nMr Davison, who had called it a \"Doomsday\" device, was told the device could have been triggered in seconds from any computer, laptop or phone in the possession of about 20 people on the propertyBut honestly? Maybe not a doomsday device per say... but it depends how you define that. Similarly it is possible to cause solar flares which do emit large amounts of electromagnetism (consequentially - and often - disrupting radio waves and electronics).\n\nMy friend specialized in designing EMP weapons in the military but noted they usually require too much power and the yield is generally little (now a-day it takes quite a bit of punch to restart a single computer let alone a server farm). But should the right sort of power source be used to create a sustained\/strong electromagnetic pulse, it may be possible (quite unlike most movies where EMPs do major damage... was sad to hear this).\n\nThere are, of course, more practical things. Like botnets to consider... plus as I noted in my security piece on IPv6 on my website, as IPv6 is adopted to a larger degree, so too will security technician's need to explore adequate protection for both home users and servers. As with any new technology, unless it is studied thoroughly and things like firewalls are ready for it (to guard against it and to provide support for it), there are a lot of inherent security risks (IPv6 has a bit of a problem with types of DDoS).So, you believe there could be a hand held switch(or a device that can send a signal) that, when pressed, could\/would erase all of the selected servers(by that I mean all of the evidence of illegal activity on those servers) around the world?\n\nI mean, even EMP is only line-of-sight. There would be no way for an EMP to reach every selected server around the earthTrue... and no I don't know about the hand held switch. That I doubt. But I do think things can disrupt our technology as a whole, globally, all at once. Like something that causes a massive solar flare, or one caused by itself. But yeah, doomsday switch, not sure on that oneThere's no way a device like that would exist. You need a real person in front of a computer to manually remove data. Such a device if existed would have to be coded for that exact use. This isn't the X-Files hereCreating a virus or bot that talked to a command center waiting for instructions (such as removing files) is nothing new. All bots these days do it from Zeus, conficker, etc however those are installed manually or by infection\n\nDo I think he had this device on his servers? No\n\nNaming is doomsday just makes it sound scary and grab people's attention\n\nWhy is everyone over thinking this and talking about EMPs and calling this X-Files? If you have access to your own server, then all you have to do is create an executable that will reformat the hard disc. Here's one example.the\n\nAgreed. My main assumption was getting access, hence botnets or malicious code on said servers. But I maintain that I don't think a doomsday device is possible (with the exception of nuclear payload to the sun causing massive solar flares or *insert random scifi catastrophic event here*). But a doomsday device, one device that... on earth... can do this? I don't believe it.\n\nPlus that whole access argument is moot. To my knowledge no person or group has access to every server and\/or administrative access to every device on earth. That's stupid.\n\nAlmost as dumb as the notion that \"the government monitors and controls everything.\" Come on. I have a network that isn't even connected to the internet as a whole I use for testing!\n\nI guess doomsday to me means something else. I'm talking about all electronics, including servers online and off, dead. Which will naturally occur the day the earth's magnetic polarity switches as a whole one day... man made or not. Geology class told me it'll occur in the distant future or something.... best scenario I can see is that it is FBI FEAR MONGERING.\n\nImpossible? What is your role in technology these days? You do realize that its not complicated to make some software that calls home at your desire times or have it setup to listen for instructions.\n\nWe dont know the extent of his reach into what exactly what his control over the the servers were afaik. With the amount of money he was making your guess is good as mine. To answer your question to do it is not hard, a small set of code and that listens or checks for instructions is not complicated\n\nOne thing I wil admit to, if the servers were taken off line fast enough data destruction of a hard drive takes a good amount of time to do a certain amount of wipes were the drives where the data is not recoverable.\n\nThat's true. Imagine if botnets\/malicious code was shipped - for example - in server software\/firmware, preinstalled and the attacker(s) had remote access to this (Stuxnet's possible deployment is coming to mind; realize I know that Stuxnet was designed for a very specific system, I mean in deployment only). Or forget shipping out with it from a manufacturer, just the basics of what GZ is saying: malicious code that somehow finds its way on the right systems worldwide. Botnets, malicious code, root keys, etc... if written to deliver a crippling payload could potentially be a big threat.\n\nIf you could somehow infect big enough systems or the right systems, GZ is right. It would be devastating. Tier 1 and 2 providers? Interrupt service\/cripple the internet?\n\nI was saying unlikely because affecting that many systems to have the end result of a \"doomsday scenario\" is improbable. But possible? That's another story. Still... I have a tough time thinking of that as a \"doomsday scenario,\" but I do think it'll be very crippling to the internet.\n\nAgain that's part of the problem. How do you define a \"doomsday scenario,\" OP? Stopping electronics worldwide\/crippling technology like that or just crippling the normal course of business on the internet? I think those two are very different... anyone else agreeDoomsday to their case, which sounds like it was already doomed from the start last I heard\n\nThe article is written in a way that doesn't say if they are talking about wiping the data from his servers or what.

{"text":"share this story\n\nHave computer hackers met their match? Not quite yet. But new research suggests that so-called quantum computers now in development could lead to data transfer that is \"perfectly secure.\"\n\nQuantum computers may sound like a dream, promising to make massive calculations atblazing speeds, but some experts have dreaded them. To a computer security specialist, the fact that a quantum computer can break encryption codes is exciting, but it's also scary; how are you supposed to keep quantum data safe? A paper published in the latest issue of Science appears to fill this major gap in quantum computers' defenses before any hackers are able to take advantage of it.\n\nEven after quantum computers become advanced enough to be useful, not everyone's going to have their own. There will may be just a few of them in the world, and users will connect with them to use their computational power the same way you might log onto Dropbox to get a file. With so many users on the system, it could be a disaster if someone compromised the security.\n\nIt may come as no surprise that the solution to the quantum problem is itself founded in quantum physics. As Stefanie Barz, lead author of the study said, \"Quantum physics solves one of the key challenges in distributed computing. It can preserve data privacy when users interact with remote computing centers.\" The new scheme takes advantage of the fact that, in a quantum mechanical system, one can't observe certain objects without changing them. In the same way, if someone were spying on data you sent to a quantum computer with the new technique, not only would the spy learn nothing, you'd be able to tell that your data had been compromised.\n\nThis is has the potential to be much more useful than old-fashioned encryption, which relies on the assumption that your computer can create a code that's too difficult for someone else to crack in a reasonable amount of time. Under the new quantum encryption scheme, it's not just unlikely that someone else will be able to break into your data\u2014it's impossible.\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nI dunno.

There doesn't seem to be much research on practical quantum Turing machines, at all (not sure anybody has the slightest idea how this could be done, at all, with existing elements) and QCs can not solve any problem that a regular Turing machine can't solve.

{"text":"CanSecWest Researchers have devised two novel ways to eavesdrop on people as they enter passwords, emails, and other sensitive information into computers, even when they're not connected to the internet or other networks.\n\nExploiting vibrational patterns and electromagnetic pulses that emanate with every character entered, the Italian researchers are able to remotely sniff keystrokes from significant distances. The techniques use inexpensive equipment and can be hard for targets to detect, making them ideal for snooping on unsuspecting people in the office or building next door.\n\n\"The data is there,\" Andrea Barisani, of security firm Inverse Path, told those attending the CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. \"That's the important thing you need to know: whenever you type your data goes somewhere else. Not many people think about that.\"\n\nThe first method involves the use of laser microphones, which have long been the stuff of thrillers with spies who eavesdrop on conversations spoken from afar. By pointing the devices at windows, snoops can read the sound waves and then reconstruct the words that are being spoken.\n\nBarisani, who was joined on stage by fellow Inverse Path colleague Daniele Bianco, said laser microphones can be trained on a laptop computer or desktop keyboard to similarly read the characters being entered. Because each keystroke has a distinctly different sound vibration, it is possible to remotely discern the characters by capturing the sound and then subjecting it to analysis.\n\nThe process is akin to the way secret codes are often cracked. An eavesdropper first figures out which sound represents the space bar. From there, he compares the input against words in a dictionary for likely matches. The more input the device picks up, the more accurate it becomes. Because keystrokes sound different for different people, a snoop would need to learn the distinctive sounds of each person being spied on.\n\nOf course, the technique requires the eavesdropper to have a clean line of sight to the target PC, but it remains suitable for snooping on people typing in public places or next to windows. An attacker can also use one line of sight to point the laser on the victim and a separate straight line to receive the signal that's bounced back for analysis. What's more, infrared lasers can be used to escape detection.\n\nPage:\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nGo on then, do it.\n\nThe idea that you can sniff keystrokes by their sound is all well and good under lab conditions, but the real world is a very different place.\n\nFirstly you would need line of site to the keyboard, hitting a surface is simply not good enough if there is more than one keyboard in the room.\n\nSecondly it relies on people's typing technique being consistent, I'm sure this is fine for trained typists but real people are completely inconsistent in their technique - most of us don't even hit the same key with the same finger every time.\n\nSo yes I'm sure it's possible under very specific conditions, but it looks like a headline grabbing excercise to me and it's not something I'll be worrying about.\n\nUSB Immune?\n\nUSB is not immune because it uses differential signalling.\n\nThe benefit of using differential signalling is that higher data rates can be achieves because noise is reduced by utilising the high common mode rejection ratio of a differential input amplifier on the receiver end of the cable, any radiated noise received in the cable is common to both positive and negative signal lines because of their close proximity and twisting.\n\nThat is, the differental signalling concept is used to increase the speed of transmission.\n\nYou're still going to get radiated emissions from the cable.\n\nThe detection techniques rely on two principles:\n\nradiated noise in the form of RF\n\nconducted noise back up the power cable.\n\nI think you'll find you will still get high frequency noise superimposed on the power line, albeit very small in amplitude. Sure, the power supply contains inductors, and if in series with the power line will provide a high impedance path to high frequency signals, but it's a high impedance which results in attenuation, it's not infinite attenuation.\n\nYou'd need to start adding appropriately designed filters on the power lines to suppress the conducted emissions.\n\nIf you really want to prevent people spying on you using the techniques then you need to start adopting TEMPEST principles and taking to the extreme, everything would be house in a Faraday cage, a big metal box, ie..a room with no windows, metal doors with berillium copper finger strips space close together down the edges of the doors to provde 100% continuity of screening."}

That's what National Cyber Security Awareness Month\u2014observed in October 2012\u2014is all about!\n\nOUR SHARED RESPONSIBILITY\n\nIndividuals, organizations, and communities throughout the United States are gearing up to promote National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM) and let others know that all of us have a role in protecting our digital lives. Tens of thousands of NCSAM participants across the country will be doing their part by posting safety and security tips on social networks, educating their customers and employees, engaging in traditional media, displaying posters, posting tips, holding events, and much more.\n\nIf you are concerned about making the Internet safer and more secure for everyone, we invite you to become an active participant in National Cyber Security Awareness Month. Everyone can do something\u2014even if you have less than one hour to devote to this effort!\n\nWhy NCSAM is So Important\n\nWe lead Web-based, digital lives. From personal computers, smartphones, and tablets, e-book readers, to working, shopping, and social networking, virtually every aspect of our lives touches the digital world. Even when we are not directly connected to the Internet, this vast worldwide connection of computers, data, and websites supports our everyday lives through financial transactions, transportation systems, healthcare records, emergency response systems, personal communications, and more.\n\nThis reliance increases as digital technology advances and high speed Internet access becomes more widespread. Yet, if we are to maximize the convenience, speed, and future potential of a digital society, we must protect the resource that makes it possible.\n\nThe Internet is a shared resource and securing it is Our Shared Responsibility, the theme for 2012 National Cyber Security Awareness Month.\n\n community awareness, educating young people, training employees\u2014together we will be a more resilient and safer digital society.\n\nSTOP. THINK. CONNECT.\n\nCybersecurity begins with STOP. THINK. CONNECT. These three simple are the starting point for staying safer and more secure online.\n\nSTOP: Before you use the Internet, take time to understand the risks and learn how to spot potential problems.\n\nTHINK: Take a moment to be certain the"}

In response, the FBI set up a safety net months ago using government computers to prevent Internet disruptions for those infected users. But, that system is close to being shut down.\n\nIf you go to  you can find out if you're infected and how to fix the problem. Do it soon because after July 9, infected users won't be able to connect to the Internet."}
{"text":"How hacking really works (and why we should worry)\n\nI'm not sure that most people understand this. From my conversations, I get the impression that most people think \"hackers\" can write special code that simply \"gets around\" the security. They think hackers perform the digital equivalent of forcing a window. In fact, modern hacking usually means nicking your key and walking through the front door.\n\nThe technique was well illustrated in the ultimate hacker film, 1983\u2032s War Games. \"They change the password every couple of weeks'\" says Matthew Broderick's character, \"but I know where they write it down\". (That, by the way, is why smart systems administrators never force people to change their passwords every three months.)\n\nBut on another level, Atwood's piece is about how the Web of passwords and information in which we now live leaves us more open than ever before to these social exploits. Online services make social hacking easier than ever before.\n\nAtwood's post links, among other things, to writer Mat Honan's hacking tale \u2013 he had his iPhone, iPad and MacBook wiped and they got into his Twitter account too. How'd they do it? They rang Apple, provided a billing address and the last four digits of a credit card, and they were in. It turns out that both of these pieces of information are easy to find through other routes. Honan's hacker used Amazon, among other things.\n\nHonan's vulnerabilities were the same vulnerabilities most people have. It wasn't that he used \"123456\u2033 or \"password\" or \"welcome' as his password, though lots of people do. His problem was that he had various pieces of information spread through multiple online services \u2013 Gmail, Apple, Amazon, Twitter and so on. The hacker could piece together the information he needed through those various services.\n\nAnd there's your problem.\n\nIncreasingly, \"our information\" is just a series of access codes that get us in to other people's databases \u2013 Google, Apple, Microsoft, Intuit, NAB, CBA, Dropbox. Each of these firms has different security protocols. Put them all together, and they create a Web of vulnerability for online data.\n\nAnd \"online data\" increasingly means \"all our data\".\n\nOur email lives online. So do our most important documents, our backups, our family photographs, our tax information, our business accounts. I think that is probably the way it should be, if only because Google knows how to back stuff up, and Uncle Bill does not.\n\nBut before this new information ecosystem can work properly, we will need to change people's security behaviour. That is going to be very, very hard.\n\nShare this:\n\nAbout David Walker\n\nDavid Walker is the chief operating officer of WorkDay Media, publisher of the online finance industry information service Banking Day, and a principal of the media consultancy Shorewalker DMS. He has previously been director of comunications and advocacy for the Business Council of Australia, director of policy and communications for the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, site director for online finance start-up eChoice and an editor and columnist at The Age.\n\n4 thoughts on \"How hacking really works (and why we should worry)\"\n\nThere's a fair number of simple but effective brute-force attacks out there as even a casual glance at any server logs will testify. I dunno how many they catch out with that stuff, but must be enough to encourage them to keep trying.\n\nI also get buckets of virus-infected spam emails, phishing scams, offers from Nigeria, you name it\u2026 they wouldn't send that stuff if someone out there wasn't falling for it. Remember the good old days, when you could just scam people with common or garden Ponzi schemes, and fictional reserve banking? Where did we go wrong?\n\nThat's right, Tel. My server logs say the same thing, as do my spam folders. Hence my reference to \"serious hacking\". Most of the bot attacks are efforts to take over a server for the purposes of distributing viruses, spam email etc \u2013 the attackers don't really care which computers\/users they find, and frequently attempt to keep the rest of the system going so they are not discovered.\n\nI'm thinking more of attempts to get hold of or destroy specific pieces of information, or a specific person's information. The Matt Honan story is about someone specifically targetting Honan for attention.\n\nBrute-force attacks were once employed in these scenarios \u2013 but not any more.\n\nMeanwhile, there's some former customers of a bloke named Bernie who will tell you that the Ponzi schemes still work pretty well, for a while at least.\n\nOne way to get into a secure system is to \"lose\" a few USB keys in the nearby streets. Its amazing the number of people who'll want to see what's on that thing they found on the pavement. Your secure network need not even have any link at all to the outside world.\nAs a rule people are more easily hacked than computers.\n\nBut before this new information ecosystem can work properly, we will need to change people's security behaviour. That is going to be very, very hard.\n\nWe should focus on the behaviour of organisations that operate these systems, not on the behaviour of people that use them. In a society where people don't take reasonable care of things such as their health or superannuation, you're not going to get people to take responsibility for informational security.\n\nI think the best way forward is to make organisations strictly liable for the consequences of the misuse of any information they store. Once a data breach is proven, any potentially related damage (e.g. identity theft) becomes presumed. Alternatively a statutory penalty rate could be attached to each type of data which multiplied by the amount of data stolen for all breaches. It might be an idea to sprinkle unique 'finger-print' data into each system in order to establish proof of where the information leaked from. This will provide the incentives for organisations to seek out the best way to protect people's information, including the best way to police the people that use their systems."}

Email helps them keep in touch with family and friends everywhere and most people have at least one email address. The growing use of digital cameras and camera phones means that we can send the images at the click of a mouse. MP3 players have become increasingly popular and can download it to play songs on them with extreme ease.

Forty-eight percent of those surveyed avoid making purchases on the Internet because they are afraid that their financial information could be stolen. Less than one in five of the 1150 adults examined in the United States believed that current laws could protect against fraud, identity theft and other crimes on the Internet.

In some casinos like VISA casinos or MasterCard casinos, you can also use your Visa \/ Mastercard or a bank transfer but we strongly recommend that you opt for payment called alternative (Alternative Payment Methods). Some banks refuse to effect any transactions to sites for gambling online. Use an alternative payment method is simple, fast and extremely secure. They are in fact virtual portfolios that act as an intermediary between your bank account and the casino.\n\nWe recommend the virtual portfolios following: Neteller, Moneybookers and Click2Pay. There are many others but the three cities are allowed in all casinos listed here. Once you've selected your APM, simply register and enter your information on your credit card.

As a blogger, I covered the whole subject of how I could translate the words into money, and I found a number of methods that actually work. Somewhere in the process of sale is made. You should not be the person making the sale of course \u2013 it could simply be recommended \u2013 that is the essence of affiliate marketing. Or you could be someone who sends traffic to the sales page \u2013 which is essentially what AdSense become an example to earn money from our website.\n\nThe first method to consider, and probably one of the simplest and easiest one, is blogging. Search engines love blogs and you can set freely by some free blogging service like Blogspot or Blogger \u2013 once put some AdSense code into your blog, you have a 'field' for making money. You only need to get traffic to it and some of them click on the AdSense links that will immediately make money for you. Read more \u00bb\n\nWhat is working Capital?

{"text":"Hackers backdoor the human brain, successfully extract sensitive dataTo extract this information, the researchers rely on what's known as the P300 response \u2014 a very specific brainwave pattern (pictured right) that occurs when you recognize something that is meaningful (a person's face), or when you recognize something that fits your current task (a hammer in the shed). The researchers basically designed a program that flashes up pictures of maps, banks, and card PINs, and makes a note every time your brain experiences a P300.

In how many have you actually been ?\nSee all those slaves standing in day long lineups to get the latest iPhone.\n\nI'm .NOT. arguing about any conspiracy.\n\nDDR or DDR2 , DDR3 or even 4.\nAccording to uncle Albert, E=MC\u00b2 it is not possible to go faster then lightspeed.\nSimply stated in DDR measurement they measure in an ongoing flank or a falling flank of an electrical switch. ( in DDR2 even double)\nElectricity = at light speed\nAnd then they really want to sell this to the human race?\n\n1) I didn't lie, I've spent time as an IT manager (among others), and from said point of view, I know how crucial IT in an organization is\n2) Time is linear. Deal with it.\n3) Regardless of WHY they don't have the devices, obviously they don't NEED it.\n4) The frequency of a wave has nothing to do with movement. 2GHZ is nothing, we can easily go into the terahertz range, just silicon's properties are in the way right now. Once graphene goes mainstream the speed goes up. Additionally the speed of light and electricity are both relative. The speed as described in the books assumes a vacuum in which light isn't slowed down. Same applies to electricity; The speed of electricity through a copper cable is 0.66c (66% of the speed of light in a vacuum). Don't believe me? Look up \"cherenkev radiation\" on wikipedia.\n5) I never said you came up with that alone, in fact I said \"And just because you found some like minded conspiracy theorists, doesn't change that.\", which is the opposite.\n6) Einstein's theory of relativity is a basic physics principle, digital information transfers happen over physical links, and will always cohere with the laws of physics.

WiFi as well ?\nWithin a Temporal Core the laws of Physics don't apply.\nRevision of it leads into another state, the original state cannot be recovered.\n\n Alexander ypema\n\nJust, nevermind. This isn't going to get anywhere because you're rejecting facts to cling to your own beliefs.\nOne last time:\n1) You accused me of not telling the truth; i.e lying.\n2) Time. Is. Linear. No need to make things more complicated than they are, unless you have a theory supported by evidence to dispute the current theories.\n3) You were suggesting we're enslaved to devices; I pointed out that's not true, with an example as evidence.\n4) A) No. A frequency only defines a recurring behaviour, and a wave pattern serves to map out the variables in the stages of the recurring events (i.e frequency) an object is in. B) A common clueless accusation. Wikipedia is reviewed by a lot of people, not just anything gets in there. C) Who says we can't? Just because we've mostly used carbon so far doesn't mean that's the only option. Regardless it's just an example of how those speeds of energy waves are relative to what matter they move through. D) It's a conspiracy theory because you believe the world out there conspires against you, not because you're one of few that believe in it.\n6) E=MC\u00b2 is a mathematical equation in a theory supported by evidence. If you think science consists of dogmas you need a reality check. Yes, wifi is a physical medium to transport digital data.\nHere, maybe the OSI model helps you out  Note that the lowest\/first layer is called 'physical'.\n\n Timelord\n\nThe young ones don't always listen.\ndenial is a river in Egypt.\n\n Alexander ypema\n\nRegardless of age; I'd be much more susceptible to your theories if you'd actually back them up with evidence.

{"text":"India 5th among cyber crime affected countries\n\nBANGALORE: India is ranked fifth in the worldwide ranking of countries affected by cyber crime, claims a report by the Security and Defence Agenda (SDA) and McAfee. According to the report titled 'Cyber Security: The Vexed Question of Global Rules', the premium on internet privacy in the country is quite low. SDA, a leading defence and security think-tank in Brussels, spoke to leading global security experts to ensure that findings would offer useful recommendations and actions. \"Much of the vulnerability is explained by widespread computer illiteracy and easily pirated machines,\" pointed out the report. This is another reason for the phishing and other scams, it said. \"In India, we went straight from no telephones to the latest in mobile technology. It is the same with internet-connected computers. They came in all of a sudden and no one was taught even the basic facts about cyber security,\" explained Cherian Samuel, Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), New Delhi, in the report. Other respondents in the research study said that many internet users need to understand basic concepts of cyber safety before logging on. \"People in India have to understand basic security like PIN numbers and passwords,\" said Kamlesh Bajaj, Data Security Council of India (DSCI). At the two-day Cyber Security Summit which concluded in the city on Friday, officials from the National Security Advisory Committee claimed that the government is firstly looking at capacity building and then eventually will work on the draft of the national cyber security policy which is currently under discussion. The report further highlighted, \"India is acutely aware that cyber crime is bad for its reputation as a country where foreign investors can do business and have been investing heavily in cyber security.\" However, it raised a grave issue that India lacks a single operator to control the internet, telecom and power sectors. \"Though CERT-India is the official coordinating authority, a host of other agencies are still involved. However, India has developed valuable experience in dealing with compliance regulation from around the world with the IT Amendments Act of 2008, that established strong data protection,\" the report stated. Further, experts claimed that the main challenge for India now is to train and equip the law enforcement agencies and judiciary, particularly outside big cities like New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore."}
{"text":"Computer Hacker Gets Three and a Half Years for iPad Hack\n\nA 27-year-old computer hacker who was easily able to break into the iPads of almost 120,000 people was given a harsher than expected prison sentence recently.\n\nAndrew Auernheimer, a 27-year-old American computer hacker, was sentenced this week to three years and five months in prison for stealing personal data from nearly 120,000 iPad users. Among the list of those victimized were a television news anchor, a Hollywood movie producer and various mayors of large U.S. cities. Auernheimer was convicted in November last year by a New Jersey jury of one count of identity theft and one count of conspiracy to access AT&T servers without permission.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department sought a sentence in the 33 - 41 month range, with U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton opting for the high-end of that range. Some very noteworthy \"hackees\" were Diane Sawyer, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and movie producer Harvey Weinstein. \"When it became clear that he was in trouble, he concocted the fiction that he was trying to make the Internet more secure, and that all he did was walk in through an unlocked door,\" U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement. \"The jury didn't buy it, and neither did the court in imposing sentence.\"\n\nLawyer Tor Ekeland, who defended Auernheimer, noted, \"If this is criminal, then tens of thousands of Americans are committing computer crimes every other day,\" Ekeland said in an interview. \"There really was no harm.\" In fact, the government sought a 6-month sentence for a hacker who had conducted more aggressive moves recently, so there does seem to be a double standard at play, perhaps because Apple and its products are the, well...apple of the government's eye."}
{"text":"Digital Asymmetric Warfare: Is It Possible?\n\n this paper, we will examine the significant impact of a lone-wolf patriot hacker has had over the course of the last two years, and what important lessons we can learn from him on how to wage a successful fight in this domain. We will highlight the relatively successful patriot hacking campaign of The Jesterymmetric warfare - no - as warfare defines a particular set of constraints and objectives. People use \"war\" entirely too often as a slang term but in this growing space there is enough ignorance, we don't need to propagate it. Can particular actors or operations maintain asymmetric parity (e.g. Jester?) or overwhelming asymmetric dominance (e.g. STUXNET?) for a period of time - sure - complete with massive limitations and risks. Not just Legal.\n\nThe problem is that it's a false promise - it reinforces all the things you were trying to stop in the first place:\n\nOn one hand it gives leaders (who haven't written a single SLOC) the idea they can dominate the space and invest in weaponry without any understanding of the limited use, re-use blowback potential, or inherit inability to keep the secret sauce secret.\n\nOn the other hand you get the same leaders (who still haven't written a single SLOC) thinking about \"air gaps\" and Nation-State Intranets. Einstein N+1 or whatever. This causes two types of problems depending on the particular N-S's starting point: 1) It continued to reinforce the failed proposition that all major threats are N-S and as such you \"need\" Government level response. Wait for Government and you've already failed. 2) For emerging markets they'll get caught up in N-S Intranets and controls and hinder their economic development which then provides a lager window and base for the extremism that was trying to be flushed out in the first place.\n\nCutting that short (it can get quite long) there is something I still don't understand. If you're going with offensive capabilities and even if you are ignorant of the basics (as many decision makers are) - why aren't they playing for keeps? I've said it before, they need to do the \"stupid they know\" as soon as their little dalliance doesn't work out. For example, there is no reasonable definition in which the ~goal~ of preventing Nuclear Iran was helped by STUXNET. And delay came with other potentially harder costs. So the moment STUXNET unraveled and you've ALSO opened up the 'Pandora's Box'** then drop some kinetic reality on the situation. Remind people Cyber can and WILL end kinetically - it's up to them. Anyhow.. -Pk\n\n** - Yeah yeah - all the big players were doing it. I'm taking about the specifics of N-S on N-S Infrastructure attacks and more specifically what happens when the ROEs aren't established for the lesser players (after all that's what most treaties ~really~ do, just set rules for the ones not big enough to break them).\n\nNot just can be much more done in this field than what the Jester is doing, but a lot more IS being done. Hell you wouldn't believe half the stuff that crosses my desk (some of this shit is getting SERIOUSLY advanced!) but there's plenty to point to. Think Stuxnet and its assortment of offspring, Operation Orchard as alluded to by Richard Clark in his book, all the Cyber Intelligence work that various experts are doing (such as Jeff Bardin who was mentioned earlier) and of course all the brilliantly devious looting China is partaking in through massive IP theft through cyber \"crime\".\n\nI put that last word in quotes because hey, if a country does it its either Taxation or an Act of War, but I digress. What just gets me every time is how very little the rest of the world seems to care about the absolutely massive thieving thats going on. Have you seen the pictures of China's new fighter jet? Its almost a complete clone of the F35. Kiss your massive research budget goodbye peeps! China's already got the specs (for free) and you can bet your ass they will know exactly what its limitations are. Thats just one instance and it was years ago. In the last few years they've systematically rooted through the entire Fortune 500 and every company of note in every interesting industry. If you can still call them a developing nation, thats about to end in a big hurry.\n\n@TheArgent The other scary thing is that they have the brains to take that information and do something with it. The PhD's I see coming out of China are top notch. Many of them are getting their doctorate's here and going back to teach in the Chinese Universities. Their grad schools are becoming very good because of this. You're dead on about the plunder of Fortune 500 companies. I've seen it first hand.\n\n@shooten As have I. Their approach has been nothing less than military. They don't only send their students out to learn from the West, but they have also consistently invited big corporations to come base themselves in China, staff it with chinese laborers to learn all the tricks and then have the company booted out of the country when knowledge transfer is complete. A few months later you will see a clone of said company appear, ready to do exactly the same thing. This has been very true for social media companies such as Google, Facebook etc.\n\n@shooten@TheArgent For the most part, they're deficient in just crap we learned in 9th grade: basic geometry, trig, algebra. I spend the first 4 weeks of Phys I pounding into their heads the difference between area and volume, no shit.\n\n@shooten@TheArgent I teach undergrad physics and I'll tell you absolutely: the ones here on student visas outperform their domestic counterparts by a solid margin. All I can do as a teacher is be the best gd teacher I can to ensure our kids are mental ninjas as well.\n\nNot kidding, it places a lot of pressure on the instructors that care... if I have to drag our kids kicking and screaming into not sucking I'll do it, it costs me a fortune in time. For those of you who've taught: you can't bring your A game anymore you have to bring your A++ game, off hours, answer e-mails, provide teaching notes, solutions, extended office hours.\n\nInteresting paper. I especially liked the quote (paraphrasing), \"a small team of A players can run circles round a giant team of B and C players\". I think that's the reason that SOF are so effective. It's true enough in the engineering world as well.\n\nWow wish I had this when my annalist paper on hacktivist for my intel class was do, took me forever to get different sources on some stuff. Actually found out about an ongoing effort to create a government coordinating system for civilian based operations. here is a niffty little article I had found on the subject for \n\nInteresting paper but I find it ironic that everyone calls him a \"patriot hacker\" while I see plenty of military and SOF bloggers citing the material he tried to suppress. China and Russia both have hacker militias that they don't bother as long as they don't target domestic entities. On the other hand I think it is safe to say that the Jester would be facing dozens of felony charges were he ever doxed."}
{"text":"Information warfare\n\nThe term Information warfare refers to the use of information, and attacks on information, as a tool of warfare. Information warfare may include giving the enemy propaganda to convince them to give up, and denying them information that might lead to their resistance. Information warfare may also include feeding propaganda or even disinformation to one's own population, either to build support for the war effort or to counter enemy propaganda.\n\nThe competition for information is as old as human conflict. it is virtually a defining characteristic of humanity. Nations, corporations, and individuals each seek to increase and protect their own store of information while trying to limit and penetrate the adversary's. Since around 1970, there have been extraordinary improvements in the technical means of collecting, storing, analyzing, and transmitting information.\n\nWe must distinguish between information age warfare and information warfare. We make this distinction because much of the literature treats information warfare and advances in information technology synonymously. Information age warfare uses information technology as a tool to impart our combat operations with unprecedented economies of time and force (3). Ultimately, information age warfare will affect all combat operations. In contrast, information warfare views information itself as a separate realm, potent weapon, and lucrative target. Information, as we will show below, is technology independent. However, information age technology is turning a theoretical possibility into fact: directly (4) manipulating the adversary's information.\n\nInformation derives from phenomena. Phenomena, observable facts or events, are everything that happens around us. Phenomena must be perceived and interpreted to become information. Information, then, is the result of two things: perceived phenomena (data) and the instructions required to interpret that data and give it meaning.\n\nThis distinction is important, and easily encompassed by a familiar paradox: If a tree falls, but no one was around to hear it, did it make a noise? The falling tree caused pressure waves in the atmosphere, a phenomenon. Noise, the information denoting a falling tree, occurs when someone's ear detects the pressure waves, creating data, and the brain's instructions manipulate that data into the sound recognizable as a falling tree. Within that person's context, there is no falling tree until the person hears (or sees) it.\n\nPhenomena become information through observation and analysis. Therefore, information is an abstraction of phenomena. Information is the result of our perceptions and interpretations, regardless of the means. As falling trees make clear, to define information requires only two characteristics:\n\nInformation consists of data and instructions.\n\nNote that the definition for information is absolutely distinct from technology. However, what we can do with information, and how fast we can do it, is very dependent on technology. Technology dramatically enhances our observational means, expands and concentrates data storage, and accelerates instruction processing.\n\nAn Information Function is any activity involving the acquisition, transmission, storage, or transformation of information.\n\nFor example, the system that tells a machine to stamp eighty hubcaps is performing an information function. The sheet metal press stamping those hubcaps is not.\n\nInformation warfare is a means, not an end, in precisely the same manner that air warfare is a means, not an end. Information warfare may be used as a means to conduct strategic attack and interdiction, for example, just as air warfare may be used to conduct strategic attack and interdiction.\n\nMilitaries have always tried to gain or affect the information required for an adversary to effectively employ forces. Past strategies typically relied on measures such as feints and deception to influence decisions by affecting the decision maker's perceptions. Because these strategies influenced information through the perception process, they attacked the enemy's information indirectly. That is, for deception to be effective, the enemy had to do three things:\n\nobserve the deception,\n\nanalyze the deception as reality, and,\n\nact upon the deception according to the deceiver's goals.\n\nHowever, modern means of performing information functions give information added vulnerability: direct access and manipulation (7). Modern technology now permits an adversary to change or create information without relying on observation and interpretation. Here is a short list of modem information system characteristics creating this vulnerability: concentrated storage, access speed, widespread information transmission, and the increased capacity for information systems to direct actions autonomously. Intelligent security measures can reduce, but not eliminate, this vulnerability; their absence makes it glaring.\n\nMilitary deception misleads the enemy about our capabilities or intentions (9).\n\nPhysical destruction can do information warfare by affecting information system elements through the conversion of stored energy to destructive power. The means of physical attack range from conventional bombs to electromagnetic pulse weapons.\n\nSecurity measures seek to keep the adversary from learning about our military capabilities and intentions (10).\n\nThe Information Age has provided new and practical means to deny, exploit, corrupt, or destroy information (11), as well as the vulnerabilities to make those attacks possible. Air Force doctrine does not yet acknowledge or define these assaults on information, which we call Information Attack.\n\nInformation Attack: directly corrupting (12) information without visibly changing the physical entity within which it resides.\n\nInformation attack, constrained by the definition of information, is limited to directly altering data or instructions. It is, therefore, just another means of conducting information warfare, one whose immediate effects do not include visible changes to the entity within which the information resides. That is to say, after being subjected to information attack, an information function is indistinguishable from its original state except through inspecting its data or instructions (13"}

The statistics also show that cyber-criminals are successful in their ventures, as they would not develop so many programs if they were not profitable.\n\nKaspersky Lab's Head of Global Research and Analysis team Dmitry Bestuzhev (image: Kaspersky)\n\n\"More than 350 000 exploits are blocked every day, while many emails come with spam. The ecosystem is very diverse with a lot of different type of criminals, but the most dangerous is the end-point cybercriminal,\" said Kaspersky Lab's Head of Global Research and Analysis team Dmitry Bestuzhev.\n\nWhile there are many ways in which criminals extract details from online banking customers, Bestuzhev said that the best techniques are often the oldest. \"Phishing is a really old technique, but old doesn't mean that it's ineffective.\"\n\n\"Most of spam phishing comes from financial, e-pay and banks emails(24.52%), while social networks account for 24% of phishing attacks. Attacks are transparent to the victim, as they have no idea what is going on \u2013 it's simple but effective. You don't need to know who to hack a website; you just need to create a fake one,\" Bestuzhev explained.\n\nBut Bestuzhev has advice for online banking users, saying that they should always install updates and patches to the software programs they run, as many attacks make use of exploits in unpatched software.\n\n\"Cybercriminals exploit weak spots. Users can have strong passwords or policies, but if you don't run patches or update, criminals will get in your machine. It doesn't matter what antivirus you use, you will be infected if you don't update.\"\n\nHe concluded by adding that users need more protection than just an anti-virus program. \"Phishing and malware is effective because of the bad habits of users no to install patches. Users need something more than just anti-virus.\"\n\nIts really amazing numbers for online banking but its also true that there are too many risks increased with this increased trend.Today customers needs more protection for online banking."}
{"text":"The Enemy Within\n\nTwenty years ago, computers were bedeviled by hackers. These were savvy outlaws who used their deep knowledge of operating systems to invade, steal, and destroy, or sometimes just to tap into secure facilities and show off their skills. Hackers became heroes to a generation of teenagers, and had all sorts of motives, but their most distinctive trait was a tendency to show off.\n\nSome had truly malicious intent. In his 1989 best seller, The Cuckoo's Egg, Cliff Stoll told the story of his stubborn, virtually single-handed hunt for an elusive hacker in Germany who was using Stoll's computer system at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as a portal to Defense Department computers. For many people, Stoll's book was the introduction to the netherworld of rarefied gamesmanship that defines computer security. Stoll's hacker never penetrated the most secret corners of the national-security net, and even relatively serious breaches like the one Stoll described were more nuisance than threat. But the individual hacker working as a spy or vandal has evolved into something more organized and menacing.\n\nAndre' M. DiMino, a computer sleuth who is part of the Conficker Cabal, is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on botnets. He stumbled into his avocation on a Monday morning a decade ago, when he discovered that over the weekend, someone had broken into the computer system he was administering for a small company in New Jersey. DiMino has an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering with an emphasis in computer science, but he has mostly taught himself up to his present level of expertise, which is extreme. At 45, he is a slender, affable idealist who keeps a small array of computers in an upstairs bedroom. When I stopped by to talk to him, he baked me pizza. His day job is doing computer forensics for law enforcement in Bergen County, New Jersey, but he has a kind of alter ego as what he calls a \"botnet hunter.\"\n\nBack when he discovered the weekend break-in, DiMino assumed at first that it was the work of a hacker, a vandal, or possibly a former employee, only to discover, based on an analysis of the IP (Internet Protocol) addresses of the incoming data, that his little computer network had been invaded by someone from Turkey or Ukraine. What would someone halfway around the planet want with the computer system of a small business-management firm in a New Jersey office park? Apparently, judging by what he found, his invader was in the business of selling pirated software, movies, and music. Needing large amounts of digital storage space to hide stolen inventory, the culprit seemed to have conducted an automated search over the Internet, looking worldwide for vulnerable systems with large amounts of unused disc space\u2014DiMino equates it to walking around rattling doorknobs, looking for one door left unlocked. DiMino's system fit the bill, so the crooks had dumped a huge bloc of data onto his discs. He erased the stash and locked the door that had allowed the pirates in. As far as the company was concerned, that solved the problem. No harm done. No need to call the police or investigate further.\n\nBut DiMino was intrigued. He reviewed the server logs for previous weeks and saw that this successful invasion was one of many such efforts. Other attackers had been rattling the doors of his network, looking for vulnerabilities. If there were bad guys actively exploiting other people's computers all over the world, designing sophisticated programs to exploit weaknesses \u2026 how cool was that? And who was trying to stop them?\n\nDiMino set about educating himself on the fine points of this obscure battle of wits. He eventually co-founded the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit partnership of defense-minded geeks at war with malware, effectively transforming himself into a digital Sam Spade\u2014indeed, the graphic atop Shadowserver's home page features a Dashiell Hammett\u2013style detective emerging from shadow.\n\nBoth sides in this cyberwar have become astonishingly sophisticated, operating at the cutting edge of programming theory and cryptography. Both understand the limits of security methodology, the one side working to broaden its reach, the other working to surpass it. Because malware has been automated, the good guys usually can only guess at who they are up against.\n\nTrojans, Viruses, and Worms\n\nRodney Joffe heads the cabal that has been battling Conficker. He is a burly, garrulous South African\u2013born American who serves as senior vice president and chief technologist for Neustar, a company that provides trunk-line service for competing cell-phone companies around the world. Joffe's interest in stopping the worm did not stem just from his outrage and sense of justice. His concern for Neustar's operation is professional, and illustrative.\n\nThe company runs a huge local-number-portability database. Almost every phone call in North America, before it's completed, must ask Neustar where to go. Back in the old days, when the phone company was a monopoly, telecommunications were relatively simple. You could figure out where a phone call was going, right down to the building where the target phone would ring, just by looking at the number. Today we have competing telephone companies, and cell phones, and a person's telephone number is no longer necessarily tied to a geographic location. In this more complex world, someone needs to keep track of every single phone number, and know where to route calls so they end up in the right place. Neustar performs this service for telephone calls, and is one of many registries that oversee high-level Internet domains. It is, in Joffe's words, \"the map.\"\n\n\"If I disappear, there's no map,\" he says. \"So if you take us down, whole countries can actually disappear from the grid. They're connected, but no one can find their way there, because the map's disappeared.\"\n\nA botnet like Conficker could theoretically be used to shut down Neustar's system. So Joffe helped form the Conficker Cabal. He scoffed when he read in late 2009 that the Obama administration's Department of Homeland Security planned to hire \"a thousand\" computer-security experts over the next three years. \"There aren't more than a few hundred people in the world who understand this stuff.\"\n\nMost of us use the word virus to describe all malware, but in geekspeak, it means something more specific. There are three types of the stuff: Trojans, viruses, and worms. A Trojan is a piece of software that works like a Trojan horse, masquerading as one thing to get inside a computer, and then attacking. A virus attacks the host computer after slipping in through a hole in its operating system. It depends on the computer-operator\u2014you\u2014doing something stupid to activate it, like opening an attachment to an e-mail that appears innocuous, or clicking on an enticing link. A worm works like a virus, exploiting flaws in operating systems, but it doesn't attack once it breaks in. It generally doesn't have a malicious payload. Exactly like the most-sophisticated viruses in the biological world, it does not cripple or kill its host. It is primarily designed to spread. The instructions that will put a worm like Conficker to work are not embedded in its code; they will be delivered later, from a remote command center.\n\nIn the old days, when your computer got infected, it slowed down because your commands had to compete for processing with viral invaders. You knew something was wrong because the machine took 10 times longer to boot up, or there was a delay between command and response. You began to get annoying pop-ups on your screen directing you to download supposedly remedial software. Programs would freeze. In this sense, the old malware was like the Ebola virus, a very scary strain that messily kills nearly everyone it infects\u2014which is another way of saying that it is grossly ineffective, because it burns out the very host organisms it needs to survive. The miscreants who created computer viruses years ago learned that malware that announces itself in these ways doesn't last.\n\nSo today's malware produces no pop-ups, no slowdowns. A worm is especially quiet, since all it does, at least initially, is spread. Conficker stealthily sets up shop without making a ripple, and\u2014other than calling home periodically for instructions\u2014just waits. Its regular messages to its command center amount to only a couple hundred bytes of data, which is not enough to even light up the little bulb that flashes when a computer hard drive is at work.\n\nAfter Phil Porras and others began snaring Conficker in increasing numbers, they began dissecting it. The worm itself was exquisite. It consisted of only a few hundred lines of code, no more than 35 kilobytes\u2014slightly smaller than a 2,000-word document. In comparison, the average home computer today has anywhere from 40 to 200 gigabytes of storage. Unless you were looking for it, unless you knew how to look for it, you would never see it. Conficker drifts in like a mote.\n\nIt exploited a specific hole, Port 445, in the Microsoft operating systems, a vulnerability that the manufacturer had tried to repair just weeks earlier. Ports are designated \"listening\" points in a system, designed to transmit and receive particular kinds of data. There are many of them, more than 65,000, because an operating system consists of layer upon layer of functions. A firewall is a security program that guards these ports, controlling the flow of data in and out. Some ports, like the one that handles e-mail, are heavily trafficked. Most are not; they listen for updates and instructions that deal with a narrow and specific function, usually routine procedures that never rise to the notice of computer-users. Only certain very specific kinds of data can flow through ports, and then only with the appropriate codes. Windows opens Port 445 by default to perform tasks like issuing instructions for print-sharing or file-sharing. Late in the summer of 2008, Microsoft learned that even a system protected by a firewall was vulnerable at Port 445 if print-sharing and file-sharing were enabled (which they were on many computers). In other words, even a well-protected computer had a hole. On October 23, 2008, the company issued a rare \"critical security bulletin\" (MS08-067) with a patch to repair that hole. A specially crafted \"remote procedure call\" could allow the port to be used by a remote operator, the security bulletin warned, and \"an attacker could exploit this vulnerability without authentication to run arbitrary code.\" The patch Microsoft offered theoretically slammed the door on a worm like Conficker almost a month before it appeared.\n\nTheoretically.\n\nIn fact, the bulletin itself may have inspired the creation of Conficker. Many, many computer-operators worldwide\u2014you know who you are\u2014fail to diligently heed security updates. And the patches are issued only to computers with validated software installations; millions of computers run on bootlegged operating systems, which have never been validated. Microsoft issues its updates on the second Tuesday of every month. Every geek in the world knows this; it's called \"Patch Tuesday.\" The company employs some of the best programmers in the world to stay one step ahead of the bad guys. If everyone applied the new patches promptly, Windows would be nigh impregnable. But because so many people fail to apply the patches promptly, and because so many machines run on illegitimate Windows systems, Patch Tuesday has become part of Microsoft's problem. The company points out its own vulnerabilities, which is like a general responsible for defending a fort making a public announcement\u2014\"The back door to the supply shed in the southeast corner of the garrison has a broken lock; here's how to fix it.\" When there is only one fort, and it is well policed, the lock is fixed and the vulnerability disappears. But when you are defending millions of forts, and a goodly number of the people responsible for their security snooze right through Patch Tuesday, the security bulletin doesn't just invite attack, it provides a map! Twenty-eight days after the MS08-067 security bulletin appeared, Conficker started worming its way into unpatched computers"}
{"text":"the random jottings of a legal alien\n\nCategory Archives: TechnologyNow that is a headline to grab your attention with those glitzy buzzwords \"cyberwar\" and \"hackers\". Even Carole Theriault, a senior security consultant at Sophos, a multi-national computer security firm, is quoted as saying:\n\nIf the big companies weren't locking down their information before, they're definitely doing it now.\n\nThis is really unprecedented and Amazon could be next.\n\n\u2026 Hacking is illegal and it's not just the companies which are the victims of this, it's also the people who are trying to use their services to shop and the sellers of those items who can't sell them.\n\nNow I'd like to look at this quote in more detail, so let us break it down:\n\nIf the big companies weren't locking down their information before, they're definitely doing it now.\n\nImagine your data is a car which you're parking on a street that has everything from multi-national corporations to drug dealers and pimps, let's call that street \"The Internet\". Now I'm guessing that most of us would close the doors and lock the car, set the alarm if we've had one installed, maybe even go back and check a few times (I can't be the only one), because we know the cost of locking the door is far less than the cost of replacing the car. Now here's my problem with the above statement, big companies have not been locking the car, some of them haven't even been closing the doors and yet when they come back and find the car has been broken into and the change in the glovebox has been taken they blame everyone but themselves. When the British government lost public data by leaving laptops on trains, etc. they blamed the forgetful peon who dropped the ball and did not appear to question why someone was carrying such critical data in such an insecure manner in the first place. We seeing a similar media frenzy now around the persecution of the WikiLeaks website rather than the more interesting question as to why the United States allowed so much critical and private data to be stored so insecurely that a single person could easily remove so much information.\n\nThis is really unprecedented and Amazon could be next.\n\nWell DDoS attacks happen pretty frequently, what is unprecedented is the media interest in the case. I agree Amazon could be next since the group is targeting organisations involved in the case, and Amazon dropped their contract to host the WikiLeaks website. So guessing that the group might target another major involved party isn't rocket science.\n\nHacking is illegal\u2026\n\nOkay here we're not using the dictionary to it's fullest are we, and some clarification is needed. Let's take a look at how Merriam-Webster define hacking:\n\nDefinition of HACK\ntransitive verb\n\nto cut or sever with repeated irregular or unskillful blows b : to cut or shape by or as if by crude or ruthless strokes <hacking out new election districts> c : annoy, vex \u2014often used with off\n\nto clear or make by or as if by cutting away vegetation <hacked his way through the brush>\n\nto make chopping strokes or blows <hacked at the weeds>; also : to make cuts as if by chopping <hacking away at the work force> b : to play inexpert golf\n\nto cough in a short dry manner\n\nloaf \u2014usually used with around\n\nto write computer programs for enjoyment\n\nto gain access to a computer illegally\n\nSo hacking isn't illegal in most usages of the word. Even in the realm of computers most hackers are just people who write computer programs, or in a broader sense people who modify electronic systems to perform tasks beyond which the system was initially designed for enjoyment. In this sense I would describe myself as a hacker.\n\nWhat the media describes as hacking is the criminal act of gaining access to a computer system illegally. Again, the key words here are \"criminal act\" and \"illegally\" since many hackers are gainfully employed to use their skills to try and break into computer systems for governments and corporations to test the security which is in place.\n\nWhat is the purpose of this rant? Well, it is three fold:\n\nGovernments, companies, and private individuals need to think more about how their data is stored, and how they secure it. For too long it has been easier to blame the individual attack rather than the massive security oversight. This impacts every one of us, because when your personal information gets left on a train, stolen by a disgruntled employee, or accidentally mailed to the wrong person (aren't governments great), it will be each of us individually footing the bill to prove we are who we claim to be and that the problem was not caused by us.\n\n\"Hacking\" is not illegal. \"Hacking into a computer system with criminal intent\" is illegal. Society needs to understand this, since the continued negative image of hackers in the media encourages a neo-Luddite approach to technology and that in turn leads to the kind of data issues described in #1 above!\n\n\"Don't shoot the messenger\" \u2013 I agree that WikiLeaks was not wise in publishing all this information without some form of fact checking or review. However, it is vital the members of the public be able to blow the whistle on unfair practices and WikiLeaks performed a useful task in providing a credible location for this. The problem here is that instead of releasing just information pertaining to wrong-doings (I agree that details about the Blair\/Brown British Government's dodgy dealings over the Lockerbie Bomber's release should be made public, we need to know how corrupt our political ministers can be) but embassy communications are out of the public domain for a reason, and where they do not specifically unveil a wrong doing they should not be released for no reason. In this instance the media frenzy around WikiLeaks seems bizarre, if one wrote a threatening letter one wouldn't expect the authorities to hunt down the typewriter!\n\nNow the big question I find myself pondering is this: Did the US citizen who stole the information and published it on WikiLeaks commit an act of treason?"}
{"text":"Tag Archives: ZXArps\n\nThis week's installment of what's-old-is-new-again in the world of malware comes from one of the many groups making and distributing phishing Trojans in China. Earlier this year, someone discovered a hacktool called ZXArps, and began distributing it in earnest as a payload from another malicious downloader.\n\nUnlike most malware we see these days, ZXArps (which dates back to 2006, and was discovered by the English-speaking security community the following year) isn't designed to perform a single task. It's more like a Swiss Army knife, giving its users a great deal of control over not only the computer on which it's running, but the immediate network environment in which that computer sits.\n\nIn essence, the tool is designed to inject specially-crafted data packets into the network, and some of those packets can manipulate the behavior of the infected computer as well as others on its network. In most networks, a router or gateway acts as a sort of traffic cop, directing information between computers on that network and other networks, and to\/from the Internet. The power of ZXArps comes from its ability to impersonate that traffic cop, fooling the network into directing traffic wherever the malware-maker wishes.\n\nAnd in this case, infected PCs are directed to Web sites hosted in China which, when visited, infect the computer with even more malware. It's a nasty trick, and it works beautifully. Read on for its damage potential. Continue reading \u2192"}
{"text":"Where Should Cyber Security Awareness Start?\n\nThe US Government has designated October as National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM) to promote awareness of the security risks associated with the computer age. In a world where the United Nations have declared the internet \"a key means by which individuals can exercise their right to freedom and expression,\" is it any wonder that those same channels have become the target of the unscrupulous criminal, often seeking to exploit our naivety to gain access to our information and ultimately our funds?\n\nMost people know the terms \u2014 malware, spam, virus, trojan, denial of service, phishing, etc. \u2014 and so may be deluded into thinking they know how these scams work. In fact, the techniques used in cyber crime represent levels of sophistication far beyond the grasp of most people and too many businesses.\n\nGovernments worldwide have an important duty of care regarding the security of their citizens and the integrity of their infrastructure, and cyber security sits at the cornerstone of this duty. As reflected at the Business Continuity Leaders summit that FICO hosted earlier this year in London, the UK financial regulatory bodies have sought to test the capabilities of the banks to withstand a sustained cyber attack as part of the 2012 Olympic security preparation. And as I reflected in this blog back in May, the move toward a more resilient environment of data security and protection is paramount.\n\nSo how is cyber security awareness best effected? Well, the Business Continuity and Risk Management community, of which I am a member, is proposing the education start at common points of interaction, including the popular social media sites and trusted organisational web pages. Getting end-users familiar with security and protocols for their most frequent online activities helps to create a level of expectation and promote awareness.\n\nEducation is a mammoth task and there is no silver bullet. Events like the NCSAM provide useful reminders, advice and guidance to the innocent consumer."}

It has also raised fears about government intrusion that could threaten privacy and individual freedoms. Michael Chertoff, Chairman of the Chertoff Group and former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, pointed out how complicated many of these issues have become. \"You cannot have privacy without security,\" he said, while acknowledging the legitimate fears that some governments will attempt to control Internet content.\n\nJohn Suffolk, the Global Cyber Security Officer of Huawei, argued that the benefits of new cyber technologies deserve more emphasis. \"The more you frighten people, the less people will use technology that drives the economy forward,\" he said.

{"text":"Monday, August 15, 2011\n\nHack Attack Hits Wrong Target in BART Censorship Protest\n\nTHE NEWS: Hacker group Anonymous tapped into the computer network of Bay Area Rapid Transit to protest the system's act of cutting power to wireless network cell towers along its route. The group then released the names, phone numbers and passwords of about 2,400 BART users.\n\nTHE PROVOCATION: I get why Anonymous is pissed off. BART basically pulled the plug on cell phone users riding its trains because it feared they were using their wireless systems to organize a rally. The purpose, in this case, was to protest the fatal shooting of a man deemed \"wobbly\" and a potential danger to others by BART police. Protesters considered the shooting an overreaction.\n\nSo what does BART do? It overreacts again in shutting down cell phone towers. The action has been widely condemned as an act of censorship, but BART has refused to apologize, saying that it cut power to the wireless towers in an effort to ensure rider safety. \"This was not censorship, this had everything to do with public safety,\" one BART official was quoted as saying.\n\nA lot of people weren't buying that, including the group Anonymous.\n\nOn Sunday, Anonymous struck back with its hack attack. One problem: The real victim of the hack was not BART, but rather the people whose information was released. If their only crime was using a rapid transit system in a metropolis where parking places are as hard to find as a golden ticket in a Willy Wonka candy bar, Anonymous' action is hard to defend. Still, Anonymous supporters sought to do just that. \"There always is [collateral damage],\" Justin Minnich told pcmag.com, \"but that's like any battle you take, if you stand up against anything, if you believe in something, if you fight a fight, there's going to be collateral damage.\"\n\nCollateral damage. The same excuse military leaders use in justifying civilian deaths during wartime. In this case, however, it's a misnomer. Collateral damage takes place when civilians die during an assault on a military target. In this case, the bystanders were the only ones hit. BART itself didn't suffer particularly. People aren't going to stop using the system as a result - there's simply no alternative for many commuters.\n\nIn a message on its website, Anonymous wrote: \"We are Anonymous, we are your citizens, we are the people, we do not tolerate oppression from any government agency. BART has proved multiple times that they have no problem exploiting and abusing the people.\"\n\nFine. Agreed.\n\nBut isn't the act of releasing people's personal information exploitation? Isn't it abuse? Isn't Anonymous doing the very thing it's trying to protest? It would be one thing if the group had targeted BART itself - if, for instance, it had released the personal info of officials responsible for shutting down the towers. Or maybe it could have hacked the system in such a way that BART itself was unable to access it. But it didn't do either of those things. Instead, it targeted people who had nothing to do with the problem the group was protesting. I'm sorry, but that just doesn't make sense. Not only does it hurt innocent people, it won't do anything to get BART to change its ways.\n\nThe following day, Anonymous organized a protest that made more sense. More than 100 supporters, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, organized a peaceful protest that resulted in the closure of multiple BART stations.\n\nMeanwhile, others were joining Anonymous in criticizing BART's action. Gene Pilicinski of Vanderbilt University's First Amendment Center was quoted on the Censorship in America website as saying that \"historically we have kept our hands off free expression. \u2026 The government has a very high ladder to climb.\"\n\nEven a member of BART's board of directors, Lynette Sweet, was quoted as saying that the wireless shutdown went too far: \"We really don't have the right to be this type of censor. In my opinion, we've let the actions of a few people affect everybody. And that's not fair.\"\n\nOne could say the same thing about Anonymous' hacking counterpunch. Was it fair to release personal information on BART's riders? Does collateral damage on one side justify more of the same on the other?\n\nWhen asked about BART's action, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer named Michael Risher told the Associated Press, \"It's wrong. There were better alternatives to ensure the public's safety.\"\n\nOne could say the same thing about Anonymous' hack job: There are better alternatives to ensuring the public's liberty. BART did the wrong thing for the right reasons. So did Anonymous. Nobody wins in this one"}

Statistics may give us an idea about how much money is stolen each year by hackers but who knows how much personal and confidential data is being stolen daily?

Understandably, this technique is more likely to be used by less tech-savvy criminals who are more interested in damaging their targets than benefiting from them and do not have very clear aims. Many companies have lost millions as a result of their networks being destroyed.

{"text":"As the famous military strategist Sun Tzu said in his Art of War written 2,400 years ago: \"In ancient times those known as good warriors prevailed when it was easy to prevail.\" Fifteen years ago it was easy for a good programmer to build a good firewall. It is no longer easy to prevail in the malware wars. Malware has become a profitable business.\n\nOn Monday, June 4, 2012, as a guest of Bank Leumi USA, I attended the Cyber Defense Symposium in Santa Clara. Having just finished cleaning up two (2) separate malware attacks on my website and blog, I was very interested in the current state of cyber defense.\n\nThe most innovative and engaging presentation was by Nir Zuk, the Founder and CTO ofPalo Alto Network. His talk was on Modern Malware: The Evolving Threat Landscape.\n\nHis Radical Concept.The traditional firewall is obsolete. Its sole purpose is to keep a network secure by analyzing the data packets in the incoming and outgoing network traffic and determining whether the packets should be allowed through or not based on a predetermined set of rules. The old firewalls (most of the ones in use currently) identify the traffic by the port # or the IP address, but popular ports, #80 and #443, for example, are no longer traffic specific. You are going to need new hardware and new software. Nir's new firewall needs identifies the user, identifies the application and figures out what the user is doing with the application based on the application content because every document coming into an organization can be an attack. Nir's firewall scans every document coming into an organization based on content (specifically looks for credit card numbers, social security numbers or other financial data) and automatically generates multiple signatures which can be delivered within an hour.\n\nModern Malware Attack. Modern malware is a business done by organized crime and state-sponsored terrorists. The \"enemy\" is no longer the lone, bored, teenage hacker looking for thrills by seeing if he can enter or bring down a website or business. The modern enemy has a business plan (to make money illegally by collecting credit card numbers, bank account numbers, passwords, social security numbers), employees (talented developers) and management (savvy crime bosses).\n\nAnatomy of a Modern Attack according to Nir. The attacker attacks by taking over the end-user's machine by following five (5) steps:\n\nbait an end user using a PDF file which may arrive by Skype or some other trusted source (note the malware does not arrive in an email)\n\nexploit a vulnerability (put the attack in a PDF document of interest to the end user and send it from a trusted source)\n\ndownload a backdoor (the enemy code is very small and it's sole purpose is to create a backdoor)\n\nestablish a back channel\n\nthe enemy can now enter at will and explore and steal\n\nTakeaway: It is no longer \"easy to prevail\" because malware has become a sophisticated (illegal) growth industry, the enemy has changed so your firewall must radically change."}
{"text":"Hack Attack\n\n0\n\nOn\nMonday, millions of websites that point to GoDaddy DNS servers went\ndown. The Twitter account @AnonymousOwn3r claimed credit for the attack,\nhaving previously claimed successful attacks on Facebook and FBI\/DOJ\nrelated sites.\n\nI wondered what are the motivations for someone to hack others and came up with this list:\n\n1. Profit - Steal financial information or your identity that can be used in financial crimes. 2. Challenge - They try to see how much they can accomplish\/get away with. 3. Use your Computer\n- Harness the computing power, hide behind your computer's identity or\nuse it to store illegal material like child porn or pirated material. 4. Attention - High profile attacks bring lots of quick attention, giving a quick sense of power and celebrity. 5. Spying - Having insight into what friends, family, co-workers or companies are saying. 6. Revenge - Feeling persecuted or slighted can lead one to target sites or individuals to be hacked. 7. Disobedience - Subversive hacking can reveal secrets or undermine perceived unjust corporate or state entities. 8. Productive Hacks\n- Hacking for the express purpose of demonstrating and reporting\nvulnerabilities will help fix holes for the future and prevent more\nmalicious hacking. It\nis often a combination of these factors that leads one to hack.\nWatching @AnonymousOwn3r feed, it was apparent that they were enjoying\nthe power and attention that came from the attack. Their ego was stroked\nby having accomplished this challenge. They responded to most tweets\nand retweeted any mentions. They delayed in giving a concrete duration\nor specific motivation for the hack attack. Later they would show that\neven a large internet company like GoDaddy has many SQL injection\nvulnerabilities that using hacked servers as bots abused. The hack attack affected\nroughly 72 million websites, although company officials delayed in\ngiving an explanation and tried to blame \"corrupted router data tables.\" I've\nonly ever known a couple people who got involved in hacking. Both were\ndisaffected teens who felt alienated by society. One was a neighbor who\nhacked into her local high school website and exacted retribution on an\nex boyfriend on Facebook and elsewhere. She went on to turn the skills\nto more productive uses and eventually was hired to help the high school build a\nbetter site. The\nother inadvertent hacker sadly committed suicide. I met him in the\npoker world. He discovered a glitch\/hack on Ultimate Bet that allowed\nhim to consistently make money in heads up matches. Despite my advice to report the issue or refuse to exploit it, the lure of\nseemingly free money was too great for him. He abused it and eventually\nwas caught. Both\nwere bright and likable enough young people. They unfortunately\nchanneled their talents to undermining the established online\nenvironment. While their motivations may vary, in a digital world hackers\nwill continue to pop up to express a dissatisfaction with the status\nquo."}

With funding from the US Department of Homeland Security, computer scientists have banded together to share data collected from sensors around the world place sensors around the world.\n\n\"The goal is to get close enough so you can actually start mapping out how the spread started,\" said Jon Oberheide, a graduate student with the University of Michigan who is working on the project.\n\nThat's not an easy job. To find the minuscule clues that will identify the victim, researchers must sift through more than 50 terabytes of data, hoping to find the telltale signatures of a Conficker scan.\n\nOne of the ways that Conficker moves about is by scanning the network for other vulnerable computers, but it can be really hard to spot it for certain, Oberheide said. \"The hard thing is to find the exact Conficker scanning activity, because there is a lot of other scanning going on,\" he said.\n\nTracking down patient zero has been done, however. In 2005, researchers tracked the 2004 Witty worm's first victim, (PDF) a US military base, and even identified the European IP address used to launch the attack.\n\nIt's been years since anything as widespread as Conficker has surfaced however, so there have not been many chances to reproduce this effort.\n\nWhen Conficker first appeared in October, though, researchers caught a break. Other worms had dodged this kind of analysis by blocking the darknet IP addresses, but Conficker's authors didn't do that. \"We were kind of surprised that it did this completely random scan, and didn't blacklist our particular sensors,\" Oberheide said. \"If they'd done a little bit of research, they could have discovered our [network].\"\n\nSoon after the Conficker outbreak the Michigan researchers saw a big spike on their sensors, which they attributed to the worm. The network was collecting about 2G of data per hour in November, but these days it's closer to 8G. \"The increase in activity we've seen on these Darknet sensors is... incredible,\" Oberheide said. \"Now this data is actually useful; we can go back six months and see what this worm was actually doing,\" he added.\n\nAnother group, called CAIDA (the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis) publisheda Conficker analysis earlier this month. The Michigan researchers hope to post a similar analysis of their data in with the next few weeks, but it could be months before they narrow things down to patient zero.\n\nIn the meantime, \"the goal is to get close enough so you can actually start mapping out how the spread started,\" Oberheide"}
{"text":"Cloud Computing Yields Cheap Hacking\n\nOur mobile devices (smartphones, tablets and the like) give us access to the Internet anywhere there is a connection. Not all devices are created equal, however, and some are simply better suited than others to handle the task of browsing the web. To level the playing field, some browsers, such as the browser on Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets, work in the cloud. Rather than depend on the device to render the content (text, javascript, pictures, etc.), the \"heavy lifting\" as it were, is done in the cloud. Then the device simply pulls down the completed picture, providing the user with a faster web browsing experience.\n\nNow, some researchers from North Carolina State University and the University of Oregon have found a way to hack this technique, tricking the cloud-based servers into doing some of their intensive calculations without having to buy their own workhorse machines.\n\nThese computer scientists have described this new hack in a paper entitled: \"Abusing Cloud-Based Browsers for Fun and Profit,\" and plan to present their results on December 6th at the 2012 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference in Orlando, Florida.\n\nWhile there are plenty of choices for cloud-based browsers, these computer scientists used Puffin, a mobile browser currently available in both the iTunes App Store and Google's Play store. By creating a browser that mimics Puffin, this East-Meets-West team was able to trick the servers in the cloud to perform some of their computations, all for free and relatively anonymously. Out of ethical considerations, the team limited what they asked these servers to calculate, taking care not to overload or crash the computers. However, while these scientists may have nothing but noble intentions, they also warned that others could use this same security hole to perform attacks, such as DDoS. Hackers could also trick these cloud-based servers into running the intensive calculations necessary to crack password codes with relative anonymity.\n\n\"By rendering Web pages in the cloud, the providers of cloud browsers can become open computation centers, much in the same way that poorly configured mail servers become open relays,\" writes the team in their paper.\n\n\"The example applications shown in this paper were an academic exercise targeted at demonstrating the capabilities of cloud browsers. There is great potential to abuse these services for other purposes.\"\n\nThey estimate that this hack could be used to trick these cloud-based computers into generating more than 24,000 cryptographic hashes in one second. The current method works with Puffin on both Android and iOS devices, though the team warned this method could be used on other cloud-based browsers, such as Amazon's Silk browser and Opera Mini.\n\nIn order to fly under the radar, the team's method also breaks down the heavy jobs into smaller fragments, then sends them as separate instances into the cloud. Once the tasks are completed, they are sent back through the browser and reassembled into one larger task.\n\nAccording to Ars Technica, these cloud browser providers are already taking steps to cinch up their offerings and keep these kinds of attacks at bay. The researchers are likely pleased with their efforts, saying: \"Based on our findings, we observe that the computational ability made freely available by cloud browsers allows for an open compute center that is valuable and warrants substantially more careful protection.\""}
{"text":"An alarming increase in cyber attacks have recently been seen in the UK, many incidents of which have been widely reported in the media. The issue has naturally drawn attention to the urgency for companies to improve their security measures. Ironically, the UK has seen a huge drop in the number of pupils undertaking computing courses, leaving the country even more vulnerable to future cyber attacks.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Daily Telegraph ahead of the government's Cyber Strategy, Baroness Neville-Jones stated how important it is to stop organised criminals, and the essential need to train more cyber experts.\n\n'We must bring through the trained youthful talent to support the transition to an internet economy. We need quality as well as quantity', Lady Neville-Jones said.\n\nThe interview drew attention to the fact that initiatives need to be developed to help inspire young people with the concept that cyber security is an arena which can offer real prospects. As such, projects like the Cyber Challenge UK for students could help create excitement and activity around the career path.\n\n7Safe, part of PA Consulting, understands the need to actively encourage young talent into the information security arena, as shown by its support in sponsoring the UK Cyber Security Challenge 2011. Winners were awarded with prizes of places on 7Safe's latest Certified Application Security Tester course CAST and Certified Forensic Investigation Practitioner CFIP course.\n\n7Safe Director Alan Phillips commented: 'At a time when the country is vulnerable to cyber attacks, the need to offer skills-development training in IT security has never been greater. We hope that our hands-on education will influence key contributors to make a positive impact on the future of the government's new Cyber Security Strategy'.\n\nTo read the full article featuring the interview with Baroness Neville-Jones, click here"}

We owe them trillions of dollars that we can't pay. What other way are they going to get it?\n\nAlso, here's a list of all the OTHER reasons they might have to attack us:\n\n1. We are, like you said, ( one of) the greatest nations on earth, in terms of military force and financial stability. If they could cripple us to the point of being easily conquorable via cyber attacks, not only would they get all of our government funding, but also, they would have taken down their biggest rival and one of the most powerful countries on the planet.\n\n2. The U.S. and Russia, after the cold war, had, and still have, the largest stores of nuclear weapons in the world (enough to destroy the world 7 times). If we are the victims of a massive cyber attack, we would lose all power to use those weapons. Then, china could take total control of them and become the single most powerful country in the world.\n\n3. China has the biggest population for a single country in the world, and yet with only less than 5% of the population of earth, the U.S. is nearly the same size. It would give them more room for population growth, more space for citizens, and therefore more civilian support. Plus, in a socialist country, a bigger population means a larger military.\n\nI hope I answered your question. They have plenty of reasons to attack us. HOWEVER, THE POINT OF THIS COMMENT WAS NOT TO STIR UP DISTRUST ABOUT THE CHINESE. Far from it. It was merely to inform that the U.S. and China are not allies.\n\nAnyone who did not see Beantown's sarcasm should be shot. Plain as day people. Secondly, the real threat should be our own arrogance. Hackers are inescapably arrogant, when they say something is secure, they will prop their feet up with their hands clasped behind their head, $#!t eating grin on the whole time, until someone else hacks it. I just wish this pissing contest would be over. Seriously, if your going to steal from me, come on over and mug me like a normal human being.

You're no different than a guy who leaves his front door wide open in that regard.\n\nThe difference between your analogy and what happened is Sony knew that their system was compromised with Anonymous' initial video saying they had access to the user database but wouldn't touch it. The analogy of the guy that left his front door open compared to the Chernobyl defense is weak. The analogy best suited for this is the guy leaving his front door open, was told he would get robbed if he did that, and continued to leave said door open and get robbed.\n\nQuote:\n\nI'm no genius when it comes to this shit, but I don't interpret someone saying they are capable of attacking login servers as them saying they have the ability to steal personal information.\n\nYou must've missed the last bit where they said they had access to the entire PSN servers.

When you log onto the PSN server, you log into your specific user data, you don't have access to anything else but your own specific sector of data.

NSCI is a small,\nveteran-owned business headquartered in Virginia.\nEthical hacking, also known as penetration tests, intrusion testing or red teaming, is increasingly being\nused by government and industry organizations to identify security risks. Ethical hackers, sometimes called white\nhats, are hackers that use penetration testing or security system attacks at the request of an organization in order\nto identify flaws or vulnerabilities before actual malicious hackers are able to exploit them. Ethical hackers\nduplicate the same attack methods as criminal hackers, but they report their findings back to the client. Ed\nSkoudis, Vice President of Security Strategy for Predictive Systems' Global Integrity consulting practice, says that\nethical hacking has continued to grow despite drawbacks in the IT industry. Ethical hacking was first used primarily\nin the government and technology sectors, although many large companies are now requesting penetration tests.\n1\nOther companies, such as IBM, keep employee teams of ethical hackers.\nSearchsecurity.com offers the following definition of an ethical hacker: \"An ethical hacker is a computer and\nnetwork expert who attacks a security system on behalf of its owners, seeking vulnerabilities that a malicious\nhacker could exploit. Ethical hackers use the same methods as their less-principled counterparts but report\n2\nproblems instead of taking advantage of them.\" Ethical hackers usually have a professional background as\nprogrammers or network administrators, and usually have a variety of skills including: the ability to write programs\nin many programming languages; knowledge of assembly language; and some programming ability. Ethical hackers\nalso benefit from knowledge of a variety of systems, especially Microsoft Windows and Linux. Ethical hackers must\nhave in-depth networking knowledge and at least a basic understanding of TCP\/IP protocols. Ethical hackers can\nobtain the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification and EC-Council Certified Security Analyst (ECSA) certifications\nfrom EC-Council. The Licensed Penetration Tester (LPT) certification requires candidates to agree to a code of\nethics and provide evidence of professional security experience.\nSecurity experts provide findings on security vulnerabilities, and also recommendations for clients to\nremediate security issues and improve overall security. Some services provided by hackers include: application\ntesting, which identifies design and logic flaws; war dialing, which identifies unauthorized modems on a network;\nnetwork testing, which looks for security flaws on external and internal networks, systems and devices; wireless\nsecurity assessments that evaluate the security of a company's wireless infrastructure; and system hardening,\n3\nwhich assesses configuration issues and vulnerabilities to measure overall network security.\nPaul Klahn, director of assessment services with FishNet, says that organizations need to remember that\npenetration testing does not guarantee network security, and that ethical hacking services return only statistics.\nKlahn says that the findings from ethical hacking services must be put into a business context to benefit the\ncompany. The identified security flaws must be prioritized according to the extent of threat and how critical a\npatch is. Experts also stress that ethical hacking is only another security tool, and should be used along with other\ntools to improve corporate security.

The scope of the engagement and travel expenses may also increase service costs. Security expert\nBruce Schneier explains that \"penetration testing is a broad term\" and can be one of many services including\ndocumenting network vulnerabilities, performing remote attacks, penetrating a data center or attempting social\nengineering attacks. Schneier also says that penetration testing services offer many different scanning tools and\nwhite-hat hackers with different skill levels. All of these factors could affect the total cost of penetration testing\n12\nservices.\nSecurity company, Plynt, which provides penetration testing services, application security testing and\nsecurity code reviews, say that their penetration tests have ranged in price from $5,000 to $50,000 depending on\n13\nthe size of the application and skill of the testers. According to a presentation by the Kansas Department of\nRevenue, most penetration testing projects will cost between $20,000 to $100,000 depending on the number on\n14\nURLs and depth of the vulnerability assessments. Web sites of companies that provide testing services all say that\npricing information will be unique to each job based on size and complexity and recommend contacting the\ncompany with specific job details for pricing information. Companies also agree that most organizations outsource\ntheir penetration testing projects because of the high cost of training or acquiring skilled penetration testers. The\ndevelopment of automated penetration testing software has provided companies with a low cost alternative to\noutsourcing security testing.\nGovernment Agencies are increasingly using third-party companies to perform vulnerability\nassessments\/penetration testing, and some such as the Department of Defense have personnel that complete the\nCertified Ethical Hacker certification courses. As part of a set of security guidelines for protecting federal\ninformation systems, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends that federal agencies\nconduct regular penetration tests. The NIST's Guide for Assessing Security Controls in Federal Information Systems,\nwhich was published in March 2008, says that government agencies should train selected personnel in penetration\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n110 Royal Aberdeen \u2022 Smithfield VA 23430 \u2022 (757) 871-3578\nImproving the Future of Cyberspace...Issues, Ideas Answers\n5\nCERTIFIED ETHICAL HACKING OVERVIEW\nKathryn.Stephens@nsci-va.org\nJanuary 19, 2009\ntesting tools and techniques that should be frequently updated to include emerging vulnerabilities. The NIST also\nrecommends using the more cost-effective automated penetration tools. Executive managing director of computer\nforensics consultants Stroz Friedberg, Scott Larson was the former head of the FBI's National Infrastructure and\nComputer Investigations division, and reports that many agencies already conduct penetration tests. Larson says\n15\nthat government agencies should go through outside auditors for testing.\nFISMA, the Federal Information Security Management Act, requires that federal agencies implement an\nagency-wide information security program that includes periodic risk assessments. Rapid7 Security Consultants\noffer NeXpose, an automated penetration testing program that locates threats, assesses the risk of each threat,\nand provides a remediation plan that specifically targets government agencies. Rapid7 offers penetration testing,\nbest practices consulting, social engineering, and compliance testing to government agencies that aim to assist in\n16\nFISMA requirement compliance.\nIntelArtisans is another company that provides assessment services specifically for Federal Government\nagencies. IntelArtisans provides federal agencies with system security planning, security testing and control\nassessments, certification and accreditation, risk management, continuous monitoring, and ISSO support with the\ngoal of helping federal agencies comply with IT requirements and identity potential security threats before they\n17\nare exploited.\nCore Security Technologies, who developed the CORE IMPACT penetration product, reported in 2007 that\nstate government is a rapidly growing market for penetration testing services. Core Security Technologies also said\nthat, at the time, 30 percent of states were using CORE IMPACT including Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Louisiana,\nMaryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Carolina. Steve Bass, chief information\nsecurity officer for the Maryland Department of Public Safety said that penetration testing is becoming increasingly\nnecessary as state agencies are extending their network boundaries for collaboration and information sharing.\nAutomated penetration testing services are becoming increasingly popular among government agencies and state\n18\ngovernment agencies because of the pressures of satisfying rigid compliance requirements.\nAdditional Ethical Hacking Information:\nThe following are some of the common types of testing involved in penetration testing services:\n\uf0b7 Application security testing: Testing identifies vulnerabilities that result from organizations offering\naccess to business functionality through web-based application. Tests may evaluate the application's use\nof encryption, how users are authenticated, and the use of cookies by the web server application.\n\uf0b7 Denial of Service (DoS) testing: DoS testing evaluates the systems vulnerability to attacks that will\ncompletely deny service by blocking even legitimate access attempts.\n\uf0b7 War Dialing: Tests aim to identify modems, remote access devices and maintenance connections of\ncomputers on an organization's network. Penetration testing is used to see if connections can be\nexploited to penetrate the organization's information systems network.\n\uf0b7 Wireless network penetration testing: Tests look for security gaps or flaws in design, implementation or\noperation of the wireless network. These tests are becoming increasingly important as wireless devices\nare increasingly being used for business activities.\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n110 Royal Aberdeen \u2022 Smithfield VA 23430 \u2022 (757) 871-3578\nImproving the Future of Cyberspace...Issues, Ideas Answers\n6\nCERTIFIED ETHICAL HACKING OVERVIEW\nKathryn.Stephens@nsci-va.org\nJanuary 19, 2009\n\uf0b7 Social Engineering: Social engineering tests involve some form of social interaction, usually with\nemployees or suppliers. Tests aim to gather information which could help hackers penetrate the\norganization's systems. Hackers may pretend to be an employee to obtain account and password\ninformation, intercepts mail that contains sensitive information, or gain physical access to restricted areas\n19\nthat hold confidential information.\nA recent article from ComputerWorld provides some recommendations for successful and more cost effective\npenetration testing. The article recommends that companies set specific goals with high priority systems to reduce\ncosts from an unnecessarily large test. Senior training engineer Joe Basirico of Security Innovations, Inc. says that\ncompanies must assign staff and resources to the project, even if they are bringing in a third party to perform the\ntesting. This can make the process faster and reduce costs. Providing testing companies should also be provided\nwith documentation including details about encryption and system configurations in order to reduce the amount\nof time they will spend on legwork. Following penetration testing, companies should also prioritize the results and\nbegin with findings that would have an immediate effect on IT security.\nCommon Certifications of Professional Ethical Hackers\nCEPT Certified Expert Penetration The Certified Expert Penetration Tester certification, awarded following\nTester successful completion of a certification exam, is for security professionals who\nrequire expert level knowledge of evaluating computer system, network and\nsoftware security through simulated attacks.

It is unclear what AntiSec is planning to do with the remaining 11 million Apple IDs it claims to have hacked.\n\nAdditionally, if AntiSec's claims are in fact true, Internet bloggers are questioning why the FBI would be in possession of so many Americans' personal information. Many suggest that the Apple IDs, if actually used by the FBI, were being used to profile potential threats to the U.S. government.\n\nForbes magazine points out that the security breach raises several questions, including what the motive would be for AntiSec to engage in such a massive hack of Stangl's laptop.\n\nSeveral sources stipulate that Stangl was involved in an FBI group email sent out earlier in 2012 which was intercepted by AntiSec. The email touched on the importance of stopping hacking groups, such as AntiSec and the infamous Anonymous group from conducting such widespread hacks.\n\nAs Forbes points out, the FBI is a regular target for such attacks, with some hacker organizations even embarking into long term operations under the communal celebratory \"F*** FBI Fridays.\"\n\nThe FBI has released a statement to NBC News arguing that there is no evidence the FBI went through a legal process to access the Apple ID information, and therefore these available Apple IDs released by AntiSec are likely a malware hoax used to infect users seeking to view the list of IDs"}

(AP Photo\/J. Scott Applewhite)\nPhoto: J. Scott Applewhite, Associated Press\n\nThe U.S. Senate is poised to vote this week on a controversial cybersecurity bill, but its ultimate form - and impact - will turn on which of many proposed amendments wind up in the final legislation.\n\nThe competing measures promise to either strip out or solidify critical privacy protections for consumers. At the same time, questions linger about how effective the bill will be in achieving its original aims.\n\nThe stated goal of the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman, independent-Conn., is to protect the nation's vital infrastructure from digital attacks. It would establish a cybersecurity council responsible for assessing and regulating the security of power plants, electrical grids, water supplies, dams and the like, though the latest version stops short of requiring minimum standards.\n\nThe act also sets up a system for businesses to voluntarily share information about cyber-threats and creates incentives for them to adopt industry best practices. Private industry controls an estimated 80 percent of the nation's critical infrastructure.\n\nThe main point of controversy surrounding the various cybersecurity measures put forward in recent years and months is privacy. The worry is that the bills grant companies greater leeway for prying into consumer data and give law enforcement additional ability to spy on citizens' online habits, all under the banner of improved security.\n\nAmong other things, the Senate bill limits the circumstances under which information can be shared with law enforcement and forces companies to make efforts to protect the anonymity of personal data. But the bill could change drastically in the days ahead, depending on which amendments are adopted or dropped.\n\nSens. Al Franken, D-Minn., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., have advanced one that strengthens privacy safeguards by removing a provision that hands companies more authority to monitor the information crossing their networks. Meanwhile, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has offered several amendments, including one that would require law enforcement to gain a warrant before gathering location information from cell phones and other devices.\n\n'Catastrophe' feared\n\nOn the other hand, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, are reportedly proposing several amendments that would unravel key privacy protections in the bill. McCain's appears to be a rehash of his cybersecurity bill, the Secure It Act, which failed to gain traction on its own.\n\nIt would allow companies to share information with military and intelligence agencies such as the National Security Agency without user notification. Given the NSA's disturbing track record on privacy - notably including its warrantless wiretapping program after 9\/11 - this proposal has digital rights groups up in arms.\n\n\"We can't think of anything worse than handing cybersecurity systems to the NSA,\" said Rainey Reitman, activism director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"It would be a catastrophe for online civil liberties.\"\n\nMcCain and others were already successful in stripping out a provision in the Cybersecurity Act that would have given the government the power to enforce minimum security standards, which some observers argue has largely defanged the proposal. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly opposed such a requirement for its business members.\n\nAs the August recess nears and the bill picks up momentum, several senators have tried to attach unrelated amendments as well, including some involving gun control and abortion. Trade publication Broadcasting & Cable counted more than 70 proposed amendments early in the week.\n\nIndustry figures such as venture capitalist Fred Wilson and groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation have questioned whether a cybersecurity law is necessary at all.\n\nProtections needed\n\nThough I agree any legislation needs to carefully protect privacy, I do think more should be required of businesses on security - particularly those overseeing the nation's critical infrastructure.\n\nThe tech headlines in any given week underscore the vast number of companies that routinely fall prey to hackers, and those are just the small fraction of incidents that leak to the public.\n\nIn conversations with security experts, I routinely hear that companies don't do nearly enough to realistically remove vulnerabilities. They do enough to check off the compliance boxes that allow them to accept Visa and MasterCard.\n\nRight now, the only incentives to do more are financial losses and negative press. But those clearly haven't been enough to offset the high cost and hard work of adequately locking down systems.\n\nIf it's just a matter of eBay losing some credit card numbers that can be canceled and replaced, that's one thing. It's another entirely when we're talking about cracking into the systems safeguarding air traffic control centers or water operations.\n\nGen. Keith Alexander, head of the U.S. Cyber Command, recently said digital assaults on U.S. infrastructure increased 17-fold since 2009. Yet almost 30 percent of information technology security executives thought their companies were not prepared for a cyberattack, according to a survey last year by McAfee.\n\n'It's symbolic'\n\nWhen one large Southern California water company hired a hacker to test its systems, he was able to wrest control of the equipment that added chemicals to drinking water in a day.\n\nIn the dawning age of digital warfare, underscored by the Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear operations, as hostile nations and non-state actors alike set our infrastructure in their sights, we can't afford such gaping holes.\n\nThe U.S. Senate is poised to vote this week on a controversial cybersecurity bill, but its ultimate form - and impact - will turn on which of many proposed amendments wind up in the final legislation.\nThe worry is that the bills grant companies greater leeway for prying into consumer data and..."}
{"text":"WASHINGTON, October 10, 2012 \/PRNewswire-USNewswire\/ \u2013 Nearly one in five Americans report being victim to a crime that was committed over the Internet, according to a survey by the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) and McAfee. October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month, a coordinated national effort focusing on the need for improved online safety and security for all Americans and the study examines one of the month's focal topics: cybercrime and law enforcement.\n\nOf those surveyed, 17 percent say they have been a victim of a crime that was committed over the Internet such as identity theft, data theft, bullying or auction fraud, and 29 percent know someone who has been a victim of such crimes. One in five Americans also had contact with someone on the Internet who made them feel uncomfortable through persistent emails, stalking or in other various ways.\n\nWhen asked what puts Americans most at risk of a cybercrime or a loss of personal information the largest number of respondents, one-third (30 percent) said they believe connecting to an unsecured wireless network puts them most at risk while 22 percent said not having any or enough security software. Additionally, Americans' top two concerns while using the Internet include: identity theft (41 percent) and someone hacking into their (or their family's) financial information (13 percent).\n\nThe most cited concern for parents is adult sexual content, with 39 percent stating this is their biggest source of worry. Additionally, 27 percent of parents report the potential for their child to make contact with strangers when they are online is their biggest point of concern. Other concerns identified include bullying or harassment from peers (ten percent); identity theft (nine percent) \u2013 which is continuing to grow as an issue; portrayals of drug or alcohol use (three percent); long-term damage to their child's reputation (two percent).\n\n\"The Internet National Cyber Security Alliance. \"This data supports an ever-increasing need for online users to be vigilant in their actions each day. Working together, we can provide Americans with the tools and information they need to practice safe online behaviors during October and throughout the year.\"\n\nNCSA continues to work with leading companies in the cyber industry to determine best practices for users to stay safe online. Roland Cloutier, vice president and chief security officer of ADP added, \"Our goal is to shine a spotlight on cybercrime issues, and provide consumers, parents, and the law enforcement community with an engaging dialogue, tools and practical advice to protect against this growing problem. All Internet users must be educated to recognize cyber threats and how to take ongoing action to protect ourselves and our digital infrastructure from victimization.\"\n\nTom Kellermann, U.S. vice president of cybersecurity at TrendMicro, said: \"The threats posed by cybercrime are very real and can impact every person and organization across the United States and around the world. By working together, we can learn how to prevent these acts to provide a safer community for all. We're proud to work together with the National Cyber Security Alliance this month and throughout the year to spread the word about steps we can all take to protect ourselves and our youth online.\"\n\nNCSA is also continuing to work with local law enforcement and cybercrime organizations to help facilitate an increased awareness and uncover best practices with handling cybercrime issues. An example of such collaboration includes an event today in conjunction with National Cyber Security Awareness Month. NCSA board members and executives will join officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Secret Service, local law enforcement and others in Miami, FL to discuss cybercrime issues such as credit card skimming, data breaches, viruses and malware and best practices with handling such crimes.\n\nIn addition to the research study and today's cybercrime focused event, NCSA is also introducing new collateral for victims of cybercrime. These resources include a pamphlet entitled, \"If You Become a Victim of Cybercrime\" and a coordinating brochure on tips and advice that were created with input from the National Sheriffs' Association and International Association of Chiefs of Police.\n\nNCSA also advises all Internet users to access the Web using these three simple steps: STOP. THINK. CONNECT. All Internet users should take security measures, understand the consequences of their behavior and actions and enjoy the benefits of the Internet. Here are some additional tips and advice:\n\nWhen in doubt, throw it out: Links in email, tweets, posts, and online advertising are often the way cybercriminals compromise your computer. If it looks suspicious, even if you know the source, it's best to delete or if appropriate, mark as junk email.\n\nGet savvy about Wi-Fi hotspots: Limit the type of business you conduct and adjust the security settings on your device to limit who can access your machine.\n\nProtect your Money: When banking and shopping, check to be sure the site is security enabled. Look for Web addresses with \" or \"s which means the site takes extra measures to help secure your information. \" is not secure.\n\nThink before you act: Be wary of communication that implores you to act immediately, offers something that sounds too good to be true, or asks for personal information.\n\nBack it up: Protect your valuable work, music, photos, and other digital information by making an electronic copy and storing it safely.\n\nHelp the authorities fight cybercrime: Report stolen finances or identities and other cybercrime to the Internet Crime Complaint Center ( and to your local law enforcement or state attorney general as appropriate.\n\nJZ Analytics conducted the online safety survey.

You fill out credit card applications, surveys, and socialize. This is all done knowingly and voluntarily. Once you leave the store though, does the store have a right to continue to watch, analyze, and track you without your permission? This is what Facebook, Google+, and many other social networking sites today are doing, which is not only an invasions of ones privacy, it's a crime!\"\n\n\"Privacy controls only protect users profiles from being viewed by the general public, but do not stop hackers, companies, and governments from viewing and abusing your personal & financial life,\" explains Carlson Yamamoto.\n\nRegardless of what sites today promise regarding security, any site can be hacked. (Some examples would be: governments, banks, and law enforcement agencies who all have \"so called\" state of art security systems) Social networking sites such as Facebook and Google+ are open-door gold mines for cyber criminals.\n\nHackers, companies and governments today have developed Facial Recognition Software, Data Mining, and Web Tracking, And, the information that users give both \"Voluntarily\" and \"Involuntarily\" to social networking sites such as Facebook and Google+ can be used for both good and bad purposes. \"If used in a positive way, perhaps it could occasionally help law enforcement agencies throughout the world combat crime, or help end poverty and disease, or even promote socioeconomic equality. If used in a negative way, there will only be the haves and have-nots, the rich and the poor, all automatically profiled according to individual demographics,\" concludes Carlson Yamamoto.\n\nThe obvious solution to address these problems involving privacy, anonymity and cyber crime is simple; use no real names, and do not store people's email addresses.\n\nOnlyMeWorld offers a social networking platform similar in function to Facebook, Google+, yet it differs in its approach to Privacy Rights, Anonymity, and Protection from Cyber Crime. At OnlyMeWorld, people are able to participate with absolute privacy and anonymity. OnlyMeWorld requires no real names or email addresses. It uses no web tracking, no facial recognition software, and no data mining.\n\nOnlyMeWorld is the only safe alternative to Facebook, Google+, and other social networking sites.\n\nIn January 2011, Trend Micro introduced Trend Micro\u2122 Mobile Security for Android\u2122 during CES in Las Vegas, NV. Early features included:\n\nSafe surfing\n\nParental controls\n\nDownload protection\n\nCall and text filtering\n\nAs Android devices gain in popularity so does its use from cybercriminals. Trend Micro's threat researchers have tracked new threats targeting Android devices growing at 800% since February 2011. In this version, which also follows the release of Trend Micro's Enterprise solution, Trend Micro Mobile Security 7, a consumer's mobile devices will be better protected based on the new data that has been discovered over the last six months. New and enhanced features include:\n\nNewLost Device Protection: From a personal online portal, you can locate a lost device, trigger an alarm, remotely lock it or even wipe it clean to protect your personal information.\n\nEnhancedSurf, Call, and Text Security: Designed to block online threats like banking scams, blocks unwanted calls and text messages and designed to block inappropriate websites to protect your children.\n\n\"We believe mobile users need to be protected against malicious applications. To help protect as many people as possible and stifle criminal attempts to steal personal and financial information we are offering our anti-malware scanner for free.\" said Carol Carpenter, General Manager, Consumer Business at Trend Micro.\n\nAdditional enhancements offer a secure Web-based portal that enables users to remotely find a lost device on a Google map and set off an alarm, even if the device is set to silent. If the device can't be found it can be locked from the portal and if all else fails the user can wipe the contents by triggering a factory reset. As a safeguard, if the SIM card is removed the device is also automatically locked. The Web-based portal provides an easy user experience for those who may be in a state of panic over the whereabouts of their device. They just need to remember \n\nWith the sheer amount of personal information now being stored and transacted via these devices it is imperative that misplaced devices be recoverable or the sensitive information deleted. Not only do these devices allow a 3rd party to run up phone and data bills, but they could potentially grant access to online banking, social networking and in some cases even provide access to home automation systems including doors and alarms.\n\n\"With over 200,000 devices currently protected with prior or Beta versions of the solution, and Trend Micro's history of protecting mobile platforms since the middle of last decade. We are confident in our ability to provide a range of solutions that enable people to live out their digital lives in a safe and secure fashion.\" concluded Ms Carpenter.\n\nTrend Micro Mobile Security Personal Edition also gives users the ability to protect their web surfing, calls and texts. Leveraging the power of the Trend Micro\u2122 Smart Protection Network infrastructure, which blocks over 5 billion threats daily, all websites visited on the device browser are checked against the same reputation databases that protect Trend Micro's global customer base. Parents can set web surfing policies to block inappropriate content. And calls and text message scan be blocked to avoid time wasting, costly and unwanted contact.\n\nTrend Micro Mobile Security Personal Edition is available via the Android Market and major retail stores. While the app scanner is free, the premium services, including Lost Device Protection and Surf, Call, Text Security are available for USD$29.99 for a 1 year license.\n\nAbout Trend Micro\n\nTrend Micro Incorporated (TYO: 4704; TSE: 4704) security infrastructure, our products and services stop threats where they emerge \u2013 from the Internet. They are supported by 1,000+ threat intelligence experts around the globe."}
{"text":"In their release, the hackers addressed a statement made to NPR by Steven Chabinsky, deputy assistant FBI director. \"We want to send a message that chaos on the Internet is unacceptable,\" Chabinsky told NPR. \"[Even if] hackers can be believed to have social causes, it's entirely unacceptable to break into websites and commit unlawful acts.\"\n\nThe hacker collectives responded with a list of what they define as \"unacceptable\" practices:\n\n* Governments lying to their citizens and inducing fear and terror to keep them in control by dismantling their freedom piece by piece.\n\n* Corporations aiding and conspiring with said governments while taking advantage at the same time by collecting billions of funds for federal contracts we all know they can't fulfil.\n\n* Lobby conglomerates who only follow their agenda to push the profits higher, while at the same time being deeply involved in governments around the world with the only goal to infiltrate and corrupt them enough so the status quo will never change.\n\nWith regards to the arrests of alleged members of Anonymous by the FBI, the hackers wrote, \"Your threats to arrest us are meaningless to us as you cannot arrest an idea. [...] [T]here is nothing - absolutely nothing - you can possibly to do make us stop.\"\n\nAccording to the AP, the FBI on Tuesday arrested 14 people across the United States and confiscated computers in connection with the PayPal attack.

Not everyone is for sale in the way the government would like them to be and some people do things that causes the government to fear them perpetually.

No. They can never be trusted.\n\nThis is not a wargame of the security profession. This is actually a war. Sadly, I don't think the government means well.

{"text":"Data Exfiltration: How Data Gets Out\n\nMost attention goes to keeping hackers out. But once they're in, how do they extract data? Research shows it's often simple\n\nMarch 16, 2010, 11:01 AM \u2014 Cyber criminals are increasingly becoming more sophisticated in their methods of attack. Often we can equate this to the methods of data exfiltration as well. Exfiltration, or exportation, of data is usually accomplished by copying the data from the system via a network channel, although removable media or physical theft can also be utilized.\n\nIn 2009, the SpiderLabs team at Trustwave investigated over 200 data breaches in 24 different countries. While the methods used by cyber criminals to exfiltrate data from a compromised environment varied, the method of entry into an environment was often via the remote access application being utilized by the target organization. In the SpiderLabs investigations, 45 percent of compromises occurred by attackers gaining access to a system through a remote access application. These were not zero-day exploits or complex application flaws, and the attacks looked no different to the IT staff than, for example, the CEO connecting from London while on a business trip. The attackers also didn't need to brute-force the accounts they used. SpiderLabs found that 90% of these attacks were successful because of vendor-default or easily guessed passwords, like \"temp:temp\" or \"admin:nimda.\"\n\nOnce a foothold is established, attackers often launch network enumeration tools. Network enumeration tools are often used by the attacker to discover additional targets within the environment and retrieve system information, such as usernames, group privileges, network shares, and available services. The noise generated by enumeration tools can indicate a preclude to an attack. Unfortunately, we've found that most entities are not properly monitoring their systems and therefore fail to observe these indicators.\n\nIt was these types of tools that led attackers to the systems of additional hotel properties through trusted private circuits. The internal connections were subsequently exploited, resulting in the breach of data from physically dispersed sites. Without the existence of these connections, breaches within the hospitality sector would likely have been contained to only a few properties.\n\nOnce attackers gained access to the target environment, they harvested data using either manual or automated methods. Using manual processes, potentially valuable databases and documents were located, and searches of the operating system were conducted using specific keywords to further identify data."}
{"text":"is considered another attack in a series of attacks that aim at stealing important data of organizations, both private and governmental. The computer worm was discovered in September 2011.\n\nAttacking the target computer:\nOne of the reasons why Duqu trojan has spread so rapidly is because the emails it uses to access a computer seem very original. An email is received by the victim from a person claiming to be 'Mr. B Jason.' The email asks for a joint business venture with the target company and contains a Microsoft word attachment. The attachment also looks very real because it contains the actual name of the target company in its title. According to experts, the attackers launched this attack a number of times. The first time, the email was sent to the junk folder. Next time, the attackers slightly amended the content of the email so that it would look more real and won't end up in junk. This time, it was able to reach the target inbox.\n\nOnce a person clicks the attachment, the virus loads into the computer automatically. What's interesting about the virus' activity is that it doesn't do anything as long as a person is working on his computer. However, when it detects that there has been no keystroke or mouse movement in the last ten minutes, it activates.\n\nThe intent of the attack: Experts at Kaspersky Labs have said that once the malware installs on the computer through the attachment in the mail, it becomes a dropper which paves the way to the installation of Duqu module itself. This Duqu module then fishes away the important data saved within a computer.\n\nIran was hit hard by the Duqu malware this year but claims that it has developed measures to counter the attack. According to Iranian officials, the anti-Duqu software has been disseminated among organizations so as to secure their computers from the attack.

With the rise of smart phones, however, how will this effect the security of this transaction? Smart phones are, in essence, computers (even more so than phones in the past). Does this leave them at risk for malware, much like with traditional computers? Would it be possible for a piece of malware to sit on a smart phone and wait for a message from a service (such as a message with an authentication code)? Would it be possible for the malware to redirect such a message, thus allowing the hacker to not only have a password (gotten from another attack), but also receive the authentication code when he tries to log in? If this is possible, it could pose a serious threat to this style of authentication.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nI've been thinking about it for a long time, ever since people kept asking me why I didn't have a Facebook or other social networking account. My question is, what is the appeal of these social networking pages? Why do people feel the need to constantly tell the world what they're up to?

The information is presented on the internet publicly, thus it's public information. Most wouldn't question you for looking up a friend from grade school, seeing what they're up to, etc. But would someone question your motives if you decided to check on a person for a specific purpose? Is it too much to check on a person you have a crush on, to see their status before deciding to ask them out? Is it wrong to check on a rival in a field (take your pick) to see how they're doing, and to measure your own progress?\n\nMy point here is, when do you cross the line? Where is the point where you stop just looking at public information, and begin stalking? Or is it just variable levels of stalking?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nSo, I see a lot of people just posting news.

Was pretty funny, really. First was a phishing attempt, claiming to be from a company of an online game I play. They said there was an issue with my account and needed to log in to validate my account, and failure to do so would cause my account to be locked or banned. Seemed legit, though the claims as to why I needed to validate my account were kind of sketchy, until I read the link they had. The URL they provided was the same as the one for my game, except an \" L \" (lower case, did upper case for the sake of reading it easier) was replaced by a \" 1 \". Heh, nice try, engineer. Better luck next time.\n\nSecond, the hacker spoofed an e-mail account I knew and said something along the lines of \"This is an thing, it can totally change your life! Leave that boring life of hard work for a life of luxury!\" (Heh, hilarious) The link was to some site I never heard of. But really, that's not what tipped me off. First, the fact that this person who's e-mail it supposedly was doesn't use that e-mail anymore, plus he doesn't talk the way the e-mail spoke. More importantly, however, the e-mail was sent to numerous people, ranging from myself and some family, to his high school teachers, to Youtube's support e-mail address. Hmm\u2026 Can anyone tell me if this is legit or possibly some form of fraud\u2026? Haha."}
{"text":"Tags:\n\nMac OS: Online Criminals Move Beyond Windows\n\nIn one of Apple's well-known \"Mac vs. PC\" commercials, \"PC\" laments the fact that his Windows-based computer is prone to security threats, while \"Mac\" stands complacently by. The implication is that the Mac operating system (OS) is far less vulnerable to security threats than Windows\u2014so Mac users are more protected against online criminals.\n\nToday, there are signs that criminals want to debunk the widely held assumption that the Mac OS is less prone to online attacks. Criminals are not targeting Macs because they perceive them to be less secure than they used to be, but rather because they offer greater opportunity for profit than before. Gartner Inc. has predicted that Apple will double its share of the computer market in the United States and Western Europe by 2011.\n\nThe first botnet that seems to be specifically aimed at Macs was identified by security researchers in mid-2009. A malicious file appears to have been placed in pirated copies of Apple's iWork software and Adobe Photoshop for the Mac OS. That malware infected the computers of users who downloaded the pirated software and turned the systems into nodes for the botnet. There are signs the botnet is being used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nIn short, while \"Mac\" in the Apple commercial may have a relaxed attitude toward his ability to ward off online scammers, businesses and individuals relying on Macs should not adopt a similarly laid-back stance. Much like forward-thinking businesspeople, online criminals look for markets to exploit.The popularity of Macs presents the chance for criminals to launch new attacks in more places and grow botnets with more infected computers. Security policies should be applied regardless of the operating system or device that is used to access and share corporate data\u2014whether it's a Microsoft Windows or Mac system, Apple iPhone, Palm or BlackBerry, protection needs to reside in the network."}
{"text":"Q&A: VoIP hacking attacks exposed\n\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) networks allow people to make phone calls over the Internet at very low or no cost at all. But while VoIP is affordable, it still lacks proper security features. Major enterprises are being warned against the growing global VoIP hacking ataacks.\n\nRob Lith, Connection Telecom Director\n\nSome of the most common features of VoIP hacking methods include eavesdropping on conversations, changing caller IDs, disrupting phone calls, unsolicited audio and access to sensitive information.\n\nITNewsAfrica interviewed Rob Lith, Connection Telecom Director to investigate the current trends in VoIP hacking and what can enterprises do to better secure their telephony services.\n\n1. What is VoIP hacking?\n\nEver since the first analogue phone lines there has been phone hacking, also referred to as phone \"phreaking\" which came in many forms such as \"Switch hook\" where you would tap out the number to dial, and \"tone dialing\", to simple clip-ons to the copper cable lines to make calls using other people telephone lines, there have been many ingenious attempts to be able to make free phones calls.\n\nMore recently voice over IP (VoIP) is just another avenue for hackers to \"clip-on\" to your VoIP line.\n\nWith the rise of VoIP or SIP hacking tools have been developed to audit SIP based VoIP systems, Google has developed such a tool called the SIPVicious suite. One downside is that this same set of tools can be used to crack the password of the SIP account on your VoIP system in the same way as old fashioned hackers would clip on to analogue lines.\n\n2. How can SMEs secure themselves from any form of VoIP threats?\n\nSME's you quiz there VoIP service provider on the way they secure their system from VoIP hackers. To ask how they secure the SIP accounts, can they set it so that access can only be from your range of IP addresses?\n\nWhat other systems do they have for detecting and preventing your account being compromised? Do they have alerts for suspicious patterns of calls to expensive destination, or more simultaneous calls than you have people to make them?\n\nThey should be able to answer these questions without hesitation or doubt.\n\n3. What are the current security threats on VoIP services?\n\nThe primary threat at the moment is that hackers gain access to your SIP account (your VoIP telephone) line by cracking your password and then make calls to destination where they get a share of the cost of the call.\n\n4. What are the immediate implications for businesses attempting to rollout VoIP within their business?\n\nBusinesses must make sure that they understand the threats and the measures they can take to minimize the risks.\n\nThey must institute policies for the password staff use with their VoIP accounts, very strong computer generated passwords should be used.\n\nFirewall policies must be updated to cater for the VoIP protocols.\n\nDefense in depth is a useful guideline. Do not rely on only one type of protection for any part of the system. For example, don't just use good passwords, but also restrict access by IP address if possible.\n\nConsider the credit control of how much you deposit in your VoIP account if it is pre-paid or set a limit for only the level of calls you usually make if the account is post paid.\n\n5. What are the average cost implications for a VoIP recovery process?\n\nIf the credit limits are not set on your VoIP account then the cost implication could be severe and can run into thousands of Rands.\n\n6. What are some of the technology weaknesses of VoIP technology?\n\nIn fact VoIP and the SIP services can be stronger than old and \"trusted\" technology like analogue or digital lines that can be \"tapped\" by physically clamped onto.\n\nThere is not so much technological weaknesses but with the peoples habits of using easy to crack passwords.\n\n7. What sort of information are VoIP hackers seeking?\n\nGenerally they are looking to get the account registration details and the password to authenticate so that they can register a SIP client and make calls.\n\n8. What methods are currently being used to catch VoIP hackers?\n\nVoIP hackers are generally from international countries where it is very difficult to track and prosecute. In the United States there have been successful prosecutions of VoIP hackers under the wire fraud law and one published example Edwin Pena of Miami faces up to 25 years in jail.\n\n9. Is VoIP considered a safe communication technology?\n\nYes, as long as precautions are taken. VoIP has become the de facto standard for telephony today."}
{"text":"Today's article contains some quirky news items that I use to illustrate some common problems that occur when technology is involved.\n\nLucian Constantin of the IDG News Service reports that a German police officer was concerned that his daughter was hanging out with a bad element. In order to protect her he installed a parental control system in the computer that monitored her activity. It appears that the father was correct in being worried because one of his daughter's friends was a hacker who discovered the monitor and decided to break into the father's private computer. As most of us do, the father was doing some work at home on his personal computer. The father was a senior officer within the German Federal Police, which is the equivalent of the USA Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The father's work involved monitoring GPS tracking of criminals and the hacker was able to find the father's account and password to the monitoring server. The hacker then turned this information over to a German hacking group called No-Name-Crew who published significant information about the criminals involved. Thinking about this, why would No-Name-Crew do such a stupid thing? Was there any kind of political statement involved? Did they care that the daughter's father may have gotten in serious trouble, which had to affect the daughter? Did they really think helping criminals was a smart idea?\n\nHere are my reasons for why No-Name-Crew should be named No-Brain-Crew. First, they attacked the national police. Not a good idea. Secondly, they had to hurt their friend when her father was investigated and found to be the inadvertent source of the hackers invading the police's server. Thirdly the suspected leader of the crew and one other member was arrested. There was no money involved for these guys but there was a huge amount of ego, self-confidence and most of all arrogance. They just thought they were better than the police and could get away with doing what they wanted, even serious criminal activity.\n\nWhy should you care? This exact thing can happen to you. Maybe you don't have access to national police servers but if you access servers at work from your personal computer or you access your bank account online this information is on your computer. If someone steals your computer or a \"guest\" in your house comes across the computer they can potentially access these systems. What can you do? Use one of the free web browsers that allow you to encrypt the password file. If the browser you want to use doesn't have this feature then use one of the many password management programs that will. If someone does get access to your computer this will slow them down enough to give you time to change passwords and notify appropriate people. Secondly, treat your computer as if it were a pile of cash. Criminals view your computer that way. Would you leave a pile of cash on the desk? Try to arrange to physically lock up your computer. If you are using a full size computer then lock the room or the desk. If you can't, consider buying a removable drive device canister and have it installed. Using this device, your hard drive can be removed after the computer is powered off. All of the information is stored on the drive. Drives are small and you could even lock it in a small metal box. Finally, if none of this is practical consider whole disk encryption. It will slow down your computer but if whoever steals your computer doesn't know the decryption password they are not going to even boot the operating system.\n\nThe next story is another no-good-deed-goes-unpunished event. The Associated Press reports that a Canadian man approached a US border officer wanting to enter the United States to drop off Christmas gifts. The man, Martin Reisch, forgot his passport and by law should not have been granted entry with just his driver's license, however Martin presented the officer with a scanned copy of his passport that he kept in his iPad. The officer considered everything and made an exception to allow Martin to cross into the United States. This became international news. I can't see this enhancing the employment of the officer involved. Who do you think broke this news, the officer who could potentially lose his job or Martin who was given an early Christmas gift of being cut some slack? Martin got the fame and paid for it with the officer's pain. I could be wrong on who did what here but my guess is that Mr. Reisch played the part of the Grinch this last Christmas. How does this affect you? At least part of what happened is that the guard may have been influenced by the fact that he was shown a scanned copy of the passport on a computer! High technology devices tend to dazzle people and can cause them to lower their guard. If the officer was presented with a photocopy of the passport I am sure he would have rejected it. After all a piece of paper doesn't have the dazzling effect of an Apple iPad. What can you do about it? Any time a computer is involved in your decision making ask yourself if you would do this if what is being displayed on the computer was on paper instead! If the answer is no then don't be impressed, use normal caution, and proceed with your decision making process.\n\nRemember just because a computer is involved that doesn't mean it is correct and the value of your computer is not its replacement cost but all the personal information and account access in it that a thief can steal.\n\n2 Responses\n\nYour post is compelling, informative and quite original. I have completely loved reading your views and agree with you on some. I am a considering reader that appreciates intelligent, exclusive and thought-provoking material like yours.\n\nHmm it seems like your website ate my very first comment (it was super prolonged) so I guess I?\u02c9ll just sum it up what I wrote and say, I?\u02c9m completely enjoying your weblog.

{"text":"Hackers report taking down CIA website\n\nThe hactivist group that calls itself LulzSec claimed to have taken down the CIA's website on Wednesday afternoon. Connections remained sporadic by early evening on the East Coast, but by 9 p.m. ET, the site appeared to be fully restored.\n\nPreston Golson, a spokesman for the CIA, said the agency was checking into reports of the hack but had no further comment.\n\nThe news of another cyber scalp, which the group tweeted - \"Tango down - cia.gov - for the lulz\" - apparently marks another major website that has been taken offline recently by cyber protesters. Just who or what LulzSec is remains unclear. The still mysterious group began to make waves earlier this spring. CNET has reported that LulzSec is a spinoff from another hacktivist organization that calls itself Anonymous. But unlike Anonymous, the LulzSec hackers have not issued any political messages.\n\nThe name of the group is a derivative of LOL (laugh out loud) combined with security. It has adopted as mascot a cartoon of a monacled man with a handlebar mustache, wearing a top hat and tie, who is holding a glass of wine.\n\nIn May, LulzSec came to the public's attention when it went after the website operated by Fox television's \"X Factor.\" The hack left the personal information of contestants and well as internal Fox data exposed. Since then, LulzSec has figured - or at least claimed credit - for hacks carried out against Sony Music Japan, Sony Pictures, Sony BMG Belgium and Netherlands, Sony Computer Entertainment Developer Network and Sony BMG.\n\nIt also defaced a PBS website after the airing of a documentary by the public television network that the group viewed as critical of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The group managed to post a spoof news article on the site claiming that the dead rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls were alive and residing in New Zealand.\n\nIn carrying out its myriad hacks, LulzSec has also made sure to leave mocking calling cards. After launching its sundry attacks against Sony, it left posts online poking fun at \"silly Sony\" and \"You Sony morons,\" adding that \"everything we have will be published in multiple ways to ensure maximum embarrassment and exposure for [Sony] and their security flaws.\"\n\nFlexing its muscles on Monday, LulzSec penetrated a Senate server but was not able to access any files. In a statement it later issued, the group described the hack as a \"just for kicks\" attempt to help the government \"fix their issues.\"\n\n\"We don't like the US government very much. Their boats are weak, their lulz are low, and their sites aren't very secure,\" it wrote in an online post. \"In an attempt to help them fix their issues, we've decided to donate additional lulz in the form of owning them some more!\"\n\nOn Wednesday, hackers again attacked the Senate's public website but it was not immediately clear who was behind that probe.\n\n\"LulzSec is a spinoff from another hacktivist organization that calls itself Anonymous\" I highly doubt this is true, I am pretty sure they were influenced into going into hacking by Anonymous to get on the map, like they have here, making themselves infamous\n\nI'm astounded at the ignorance on this board over hacking, hackers and what's actually happening here. These hackers are exposing huge security flaws in the web sites and databases of major corporations and government institutions. That's not their fault, it's the fault of those organizations! Thousands of people have placed their TRUST with Sony, FOx and the others listed in this article with their PERSONAL INFORMATION, and these corporations and organizations can't even be arsed to keep their databases and web security up to date!\n\nThese hackers are actually doing everyone a great service. They are exposing the laziness and ignorance of the owners of these sites and databases and they are raising awareness amongst the public about how these issues may impact their own privacy and security. I'd argue that most of the members of Lulzsec are from US, Canada and Europe...be thankful that they're doing this as more of a political prank, and that they're not actually terrorists seeking to harm.\n\nAll of you people bashing hackers, you DO realize that the government and major corporations actually hire some of these people to hack their products and services to test for security flaws? In fact, there are hacking contests with prizes and awards. And here you kids are talking about beating and killing these people? Are you out of your minds???\n\nWhy isn't there more outrage that the FBI and CIA sites, things YOUR TAXES pay for, were able to be hacked into in the first place? Why isn't there more outrage from the Fox X Factor contestants whose personal contact information is now on the Internet? I found one of my own friend's personal info on there, her e-mail address, cell phone, name, address... Why are we getting mad at the hackers when all they're doing is showing how careless these organizations are with YOUR information, and in some case, YOUR MONEY!?!?\n\n@ResistRefuse\nI'm astounded that you don't seem to know the difference between a hack and a DoS attack. The CIA was not hacked. Their system was not exposed. The network was overloaded to the point where the routers and servers quit answering requests. A DoS attack is not an indication of a security flaw, it is a network capacity flaw. As a tax payer, I don't want the CIA to pay for bandwidth that they normally would not use just to prevent a DoS attack from being effective.\n\nOn another note: Attacking the CIA probably isn't the brightest thing to do.\n\nPatDaddy67 I'm astounded you can't read and realize I wasn't *just* talking about the CIA site, but responding to all sites and organizations affected by the recent wave in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, DDoS attacks (and FYI, I *do* know what a DDoS attack is, kthx) are still something major corporation and government services should be prepared for. Remember when Anonymous tried to DDoS Amazon.com? They weren't able to. That site can handle large amounts of traffic, because it learned its lesson from the kind of traffic that Christmas shopping rushes generate. If a company like Amazon can wise up and prep its servers for that kind of traffic flow, don't you think other corporations and government services that people similarly rely on should do the same?\n\nYour comment is flawed. You're still missing the point, same as the others. Whether it's a simple DDoS attack or an exposure of internal files, Anon and Lulzsec are exposing web flaws and security holes in general that should be addressed for everyone who uses these sites.\n\nIt goes way beyond that. Hackers are to be thanked for all the communications technology we use daily and take for granted. They are pioneers, always ahead of the rest of us. Really they are the true patriarchs and protectors of the net and a truly FREE society. Lulz indeed, keep it up boys and girls.\n\n\"Hackers are to be thanked\" Think again. Hackers are NOT to be 'thanked' for a single thing. HACKERS are to be taken out back and shot, beaten within an inch of their lives for their greedy, selfish acts. That's ALL this was, greedy, selfish, more \"look ma, this is me\" garbage.\n\nAs far as what this was: A DDOS (denial of service attack) is NOT a 'hack'. It's an attack. Now, if they got in and defaced something, by all means, but simply 'taking down' a website is something so simple even a child could do it (which, is most likely just what these hackers are).\n\nThis is what the world is coming to, unfortunately. If someone doesn't like you, or your opinion, or what you represent, then forget actually trying to just go your own way, you must be a total idiot and try to attack them. It's sad, so very, very sad, and honestly, there's no future if that's"}
{"text":"Is That How You Do It?\n\nI'm a network and telecommunications engineer. My areas include infrastructure and security, and have worked for Fortune 100 companies, and been a DOD contractor.\n\nI suspect [the alleged Romney tax hack] is a hoax, and attempt to make some money.\n\nStill, this is a prime example as to how a low tech 'recon' hack works, and is often the first step in a bigger hack.\n\nA surprising number of people will let someone into an area just because they look like they should be there. An AC repairman, Telephone tech, a janitor, someone in a suit and tie asking for someone by name. It doesn't matter if they don't recognize them. People WANT to trust, and they are only to happy to, especially if you tell them that the AC\/Phone\/Computer\/Printer is broken in the boss' office, and he wants it fixed NOW.\n\nMany of Kevin Mitnick's best hacks started with this exact kind of initial recon work. I use similar techniques for security audits, and a frightening number of otherwise smart and concientious people won't ask anytime more if you show them a fake work-order with the name of someone in authority (usually easy enough to locate on the company website). They don't want to annoy the boss, or delay them getting what ever issue is being claimed fixed.\n\nBingo, you now have (usually unescorted) access to the office and files to do what ever you're looking to do. Rummage through file cabinets, install a keylogger or packet sniffer, or just copy the passwords off of the post-its that so many people keep attached to their monitors.\n\nSo I suspect it's a fake trying to score some BitCoin, but it's certainly plausible.\n\nIf PWC is smart, they have already had all their systems checked and scanned for any other surprises (especially checking the backs of the computers for any new toys plugged in that shouldn't be there). If there is nothing, it's probably phoney. Any \"hacker\" that would go to that much trouble and that sort of risk, isn't likely to waste the opening by not plugging in a jump drive with an extra surprise for them. Even if it only runs for a day or two before it's found."}

{"text":"The Morris Worm: how it Affected Computer Security and Lessons Learnd by it\n\nLarry Boettger December 24, 2000\n\nOn November 2, 1988 there was a major change in\nhow computer professionals and the public viewed the security of the\nInternet. The event was known as the Morris Worm Incident or the Internet\nWorm. The worm is named after its creator and releaser, Robert Tappan\nMorris, Jr. At the time he was a graduate student in computer science at\nCornell University. Robert's father was also in the computer field.\nIronically, his father was the head of the National Security Agency. Some\nsources stated that Robert Jr. was trying to get away from his father's\nimage and have one of his own. Other sources have stated that it was an\naccident intended only as an experiment and it wasn't intended to cause as\nmany problems as it had. A mistake in the code caused it to do what it\ndid.\n\nRobert authored the self-replicating,\nself-propagating worm and then released it from MIT and not Cornell.\nSome sources state the worm was intended to look like it came from\nBerkeley. It has been stated that he did not want anyone to know that the\nvirus came from his own college. The worm took advantage of the exploits\nin Unix's sendmail, fingerd, rsh\/rexec and weak passwords. It only\naffected DEC's VAX and Sun Microsystems's Sun 3 systems. It also wasn't\ncoded to do any damage. There are two very good articles on the details of\nhow the worm exploited these vulnerabilities by Bob Page titled \"A Report\non the Internet Worm\" at \nand Donn Seeley titled \"A Tour of the Worm\" at \nThe worm was intended to only put itself on the computer once and\nwhen it recognized that it was on the computer it was supposed to stop. It\ndid not. It kept replicating itself on the computer hundreds and hundreds\nof times. This loop caused the computer's memories, drives, and processors\nto get filled up and cease working. Even a reboot didn't help because the\ndrives were filled up. It required some work to get the computer back up\nand operational and then the worm had to be taken off the computer when\nthe fix was available. Because the worm was self-propagating and\nself-replicating and it was using the connection capabilities on the\nInternet, it was able to spread to other computers. It spread so fast that\nno one had a chance to stop it. The only hope was to take your computers\noff the Internet if you hadn't been a victim yet. If you were a victim you\nwould take yourself off the Internet and fix your computer and keep it off\nthe Internet until there was a fix for it.\n\nWhen Robert had realized what was happening he\ngot help from some associates to try to stop the spread of the worm. Many\nprogrammers and computer experts worked on the solution. They were from\nmany different institutions, such as, MIT, Berkeley and Purdue. By the\ntime there was a fix it was estimated that about 6000 computers were\nvictimized. At the time, this was about ten percent of the Internet. Along\nwith the 6000 victims there were also the unreported amount of systems and\nnetworks that did have a chance to disconnect themselves from the Internet\nbefore they got victimized by the worm. These could also be called victims\ndue to the loss in down time. (Fortunately, computers were not as revenue\ngenerating as they are today). By the time the incident was isolated it\nwas too late. It was reported that 5-10 percent of the Internet computers\nwere victimized. Estimates on the damage vary but it ranges in the area of\n$98 million. Most of it was related to man-hours to fix the\nproblem.\n\nThere were many first related to this incident.\nOne of the firsts was the creation of the Computer Emergency Response Team\n(CERT). This organization was comprised of computer scientist from many\ndifferent and similar industries gathered together to isolate the problem\nand prevent this sort of thing from happening again. CERT makes references\nto their existence on their web page due to this worm. Another\norganization was also created. It was the National Computer Security\nCenter. Which was a part of the National Security Agency.\n\nThe other first was the trial of this case.\nThis was the first conviction violating the 1986 US Federal Law Computer\nFraud and Abuse Act (Title 18). After all of the appeals he was sentenced\nto three years probation, 400 hours of community service, a fine of\n$10,050 and the costs of his supervision. This sentence seemed light to\nthe many people that had to work many hours to solve the problem and the\nmany hours to fix their victimized machines. Others stated that he meant\nno harm and that the punishment was either OK or too harsh. Either way, it\nis reported that he his very successful today. One of his successes is\nthat he had recently sold a start-up company that he had founded to Yahoo!\nInc. for $49 Million.\n\nThis worm has been called a virus even to this\nday. The difference between a worm and a virus is that worms can\nself-propagate to other machines by themselves. They need no assistance\nfrom other sources. A virus needs to be propagated by another source to\nget to another computer. A source can be a floppy disk or another software\nprogram. There seems to be many gray areas lately on the definitions of\nmany variances of how computers are getting victimized. Trojans, viruses,\nand worms are affecting computers more and more. The one thing that they\nall have in common is that they cause problems for computer users and the\npeople that support computers. Some of these problems are minor annoyances\nand some are very malicious and cause companies millions of dollars a year\nfor lost data, and lost hours to recover the data.\n\nMany computer experts believe that the worm\nincident caused by Morris was newsworthy for not what the worm did but for\nwhat it could have done. It is very concerning to imagine what could have\nhappened if Morris was a malicious coder out to damage as many computers\nas he could. He could have altered the code to go after more than just the\nmachines that he did. He could have purposely started the running of the\nworm from many different sources worldwide to spread the worm faster\nbefore it could get stopped. He could have coded the worm to erase data\nfrom the systems. He could have done many things to hide the worm for\nlonger than he did. The worm also brought attention to the New World of\nthe Internet. It only had about 60,000 systems on the Internet then. Today\nthere are millions. The incident surfaced to the computer professionals\nthat security on the Internet was in need of higher security practices for\nprotecting critical data.\n\nCould an incident like this occur today? If so,\nhow much damage could it cause? The answer is unfortunately, yes it could\nhappen today. And, if a coder wants to be malicious the worm, Trojan or\nvirus could be catastrophic to data on the Internet and the cost of losing\nand recovering the data. It would have a greater impact today for two\nreasons. One, there are millions more computers than there was in '88.\nTwo, Some companies rely solely on the Internet for generating revenue.\nImagine if a company could not generate revenue for an extended period of\ntime.\n\nHave we been good in the information security\nfield at stopping this kind of occurrence from happening or have we been\nlucky that someone as smart as Morris has not come along with destructive\ncode and the intelligence, motivation and the resources to implement the\ncode? Morris' worm had only three exploits that it focused on within\nbasically one operating system, Unix. What if someone tried to exploit\nmore than one OS and more than three exploits on the operating systems\nwithin a small code? Could the information security professionals and the\ncompanies they work for be vulnerable to this kind of attack? Most\nrecently, two viruses\/worms penetrated many companies. The 'Melissa' and\nthe 'iloveyou' virus\/worm (Again, there is a question as to terminology as\nto what to define these works of code. And again, they still caused data\nloss regardless of the terminology). These works of code only affected\nless important files and data. By the time new code was created using\nvariances of these codes to do even more malicious tasks the public was\naware of what these programs were doing and they had fixes and awareness\nof them. Were companies and the computer professionals working for them\nlucky that the worse code didn't come first?\n\nIf we look at what could have been done to\nprevent the Morris worm incident could we use that knowledge to guard\nagainst new more dangerous issues to come in the future? We cannot change\nthe fact that intelligent people will be able to code malicious programs.\nThey will always be around. The coders will only change in what motivates\nthem to attack systems.\n\nTwo of the exploits, sendmail and fingerd, were\ntargeted at the OS. The operating system and software programmers will\nalways be under deadlines to get their product to market. Software\ncompanies and their customers have been willing to sacrifice security for\nfunctionality. This may be able to be changed with security awareness and\nhopefully the security awareness will motivate the software vendor's\ncustomers to force the software vendors to create secure code. Of course,\nUnix and Linux are open source so they don't follow under the issue of\ndeadlines to market but some of the programs that are designed for them\ndo. Another way to prevent this from occurring is using security software\nprograms to supplement weak OS and software coding. A structured IDS\nsolution with firewalls, network and host based solutions may have been\nable to circumvent the code from coming into the network. Or, if it made\nit into the network an IDS solution could have prevented it from migrating\nfrom machine to machine within the network.\n\nOne of the exploits with the Morris worm was\nthat users and some computer professionals were using weak passwords. This\nstill seems to be the fact today. Again, this can change with user\nawareness or the administrators at these companies to force and monitor\nstrong passwords. If stronger passwords had been used in 1988 the worm\nwould not have been able to use one of its three exploits. Again, an IDS\nsolution may also have prevented this from happening.\n\nAnother item that could have prevented the worm\nfrom occurring is security awareness or concern of data security in\ngeneral. It seemed like there was an open trust between everyone on the\nInternet at the time. It appeared as if not too many computer\nprofessionals were really into protecting the data. It seemed to be the\nexact opposite. Data was there to be shared. Unfortunately, the data was\nalso unprotected so a worm such as this exploited the overall trust on the\nInternet. Security awareness entails having the necessary computer\nsecurity resources to do auditing of the security tools.\n\nBecause there wasn't a major concern for\nprotecting data there certainly was not a concern for having trained\ncomputer security professionals working in companies and other\ninstitutions. Had there been more security professionals using the\ninformation security tools to monitor the IDS software, data traffic, user\nlogon times and access to servers then this incident may have had less of\nan impact that it did have. Today, more companies are using the Internet\nfor financial and customer support issues. If ten percent of these\ncompanies were to be disconnected from the Internet it could be\nfinancially catastrophic for the economy. There are more information\nsecurity professionals trained than there were in '88 that are using many\nof the information security tools to assist them in their daily task.\nCompanies are relying on these people to assist them to prevent such\nattacks from occurring.\n\nAre enough companies relying on these\nprofessionals and are there enough of these professionals to prevent an\nincident like the Morris worm? With all of the new malicious codes and\ncracker attempts that have generated media attention has there been any\nthat would have been considered catastrophic? Not really, most of them\nhave been annoyances. Have the crackers given their best attempt at\nexploiting weaknesses and is information security overrated? There are\nmany more tools that the malicious coders and crackers can use here and in\nthe near future. Cable modems and home users that have no security\ntraining are projected to be the next victims and they could be used as\ntools for the crackers to get to other more important targets to exploit.\nWere there enough trained information security professionals working for\nMicrosoft when it was reported that they were hacked on October 27, 2000?\nWith the rise of Ecommerce, home users, reliance on the Internet for\ncritical information, and more intelligent, motivated, and resource strong\ncoders and crackers it appears like there is a strong need for information\nsecurity experts.\n\nAre US Federal and Local laws strong enough and\nare they enforced to prevent these kinds of occurrences? In '88 the law\nwas relatively new and it hadn't been tried. Would Morris have created and\nimplemented his code had the laws been used and had stronger penalties\nthat had been enforced? There are many famous crackers that have been\ncaught and prosecuted only to get probation or a little jail time and then\ncome out and make more money than they had before they got caught. As\ninformation security professionals are trained in how to deal with\ncomputer crime evidence we should see more prosecutions occur. After the\nmalicious person is prosecuted the sentence is equally important. If the\nmalicious people are better off for having gotten caught then the\npunishment does not fit the crime. Should our laws be changed to prevent\nthis from happening?\n\nHopefully the Morris Worm of 1988 has not been\nforgotten. Sometimes the public forgets about the history and history\nrepeats itself. The worm incident had brought many good things to light.\nIt brought focus to data security on the Internet. It led to the creation\nof CERT, National Computer Security Center, and other organizations to\nattempt to prevent these and worse occurrences from happening. It led to\npublic awareness about information security and the vulnerabilities of the\nInternet and computers in relation to security. It did not cause\nirreparable damage to data or systems. The laws were tried that had an\nimpact on the prevention of computer crime. Overall the Morris Worm can be\nan indicator of other more vital exploits that may be coming. The\ninformation security field and the companies that it protects need to be\nprepared for the next time something like this incident\noccurs."}
{"text":"Malware Exploded in 2010\n\nLinda Rosencrance, SecurityNewsDaily Contributor\n\nFebruary 03 2011 12:01 PM ET\n\nIn many ways, the year 2010 was not good for cybersecurity. Nations launched digital attacks against their enemies. \"Hacktivists\" disrupted the Internet as a form of political protest. Fully one-third of all malware ever documented emerged during those 12 months.\n\nOn the plus side, the rate of growth of malware slowed, though that may have been small consolation as more governments and quasi-political groups adopted tactics pioneered by criminals.\n\nPandaLabs, the malware research laboratory of Spain-based security vendor Panda Security, said in its 2010 Annual Security Report that it had collected 60 million pieces of malware \u2014 viruses, worms, Trojans, and other threats.\n\nBanker Trojans, which are designed to steal log-in information related to bank accounts, were at the top of the list of new malware that appeared in 2010. Banker Trojans represented 56 percent of all new samples, followed by viruses and worms.\n\nRogueware, including fake antivirus software, also \"created great havoc among users,\" according to the report. Around for only four years, it already had comprised 11.6 percent of all the malware collected by PandaLabs. In the first 11 months of 2010 the company cataloged 2.3 million new examples, making 2010 \"the year of the fake antivirus,\" the report said.\n\nAdditionally, PandaLabs said that although cybercrime has existed for many years, cyberwar became much more active and aggressive in 2010.\n\nThe most notorious malware was Stuxnet, a new worm that infected the Natanz nuclear-fuel processing facility in Iran. Speculation as to who was responsible for the sophisticated worm, which targeted specific industrial control systems, touched on the United States and Israel, but \"nobody knows,\" the report said.\n\nAnother new worm, called \"Here you have,\" appeared at the same time. The PandaLabs report said that it apparently had been developed by an Islamist organization known as the Brigades of Tariq ibn Ziyad, after the Arab general who invaded Spain in the 8th century. Its intention was to remind the United States of the 9\/11 attacks and call for respect for Islam as a response to Florida pastor Terry Jones' threat of burning the Quran.\n\nOperation Aurora, an attack allegedly launched from China, targeted employees of large multinational companies by installing a Trojan on their PCs that could access all their confidential information.\n\nThe phenomenon called cyberprotests or \"hacktivism,\" although not new, also made headlines in 2010. The group calling itself Anonymous coordinated DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks on websites of organizations opposed to Internet piracy and unwilling to do business with WikiLeaks.\n\nSecurity incidents affecting the most popular social-networking sites were prevalent in 2010. Facebook and Twitter were the most affected, but there were also attacks on other sites, including LinkedIn and the image-posting site Fotolog.\n\n\"There were several techniques used for tricking users on these sites, such as hijacking Facebook's Like button, stealing identities to send out messages from trusted sources, exploiting vulnerabilities in Twitter to run Javascript code and distributing fake apps that redirect users to infected sites,\" according to the report.\n\nHowever, there was some good news. The rate of new threats actually decreased from 2009. The number of new threats had doubled every year since 2003, but the increase during 2010 was 50 percent.\n\nThe amount of spam was also reduced last year. In 2009, approximately 95 percent of all e-mail traffic globally was spam, but that share dropped to an average of 85 percent in 2010, according to the report."}

However, the bottom line is no matter where malware comes from, be prepared."}
{"text":"Though it appears to have sprung up overnight, the inspiration of free-spirited hackers, it in fact was born in Defense Department Cold War projects of the 1950s\n\nIt was an idea that appealed to ARPA, particularly its Command and Control Research Office, headed by a computer scientist named J. C. R. Licklider. ARPA in the 1960s became the patron of computer research, a Medici to the mathematical Michelangelos. The agency funded research into countless aspects of hardware and software development, including graphies, simulations, head-mounted displays, parallel processing, and networking. ARPA grants produced the most powerful computer of the mid-1960s, the University of Illinois's ILLIAC IV, as well as nearly all artificial intelligence research in the 1960s. \"Far from [our] being evil warmongers,\" the computer scientist Eugene Miya has somewhat defensively said, \"Some neat work was done.\"\n\nMiya and other hackers (the word then carried no negative connotations) were in deep denial, trying to insulate themselves from the currents of dissent about the Vietnam War sweeping across many campuses. Although their work was funded almost entirely by the \"villainous\" Pentagon (one of the most prominent figures of the 1990s digital revolution told us that 95 percent of his budget came from the military during his lab's critical early years), the computer scientists continued to insist that ARPA funding didn't make them part of the military-industrial complex. \"I like to believe,\" the computer scientist Alan Perlis later said, \"that the purpose of the military is to support ARPA, and the purpose of ARPA is to support research.\"\n\nAs part of its research support, ARPA agreed to fund an experimental computer network. The network, ARPA officials hoped, would demonstrate the feasibility of remote computing from the battlefield as well as test the potential of a post-World War III military communications network. In addition, the network would enable widely dispersed researchers to share the few supercomputers of the era, so that the Defense Department wouldn't have to buy one for every contractor. In 1968 ARPA solicited bids for an expandable network linking four sites already conducting ARPA research: the University of California campuses at Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), and the University of Utah.\n\nWhile the bids were continuing to come in, a handful of representatives of these proposed ARPAnet nodes met to discuss what lay ahead. \"We had lots of questions,\" recalled Stephen D. Crocker, at the time a UCLA graduate student. People wondered how the computers would be linked and what they would be capable of doing. \"No one had any answers, but the prospects seemed exciting,\" he remembered. The men decided to hold more meetings. The Network Working Group, as they dubbed themselves, proved as fluid and non-hierarchical as the Internet itself would ultimately be; an early memo prefaced a list of group members by saying that \"the Network Working Group seems to consist of. \u2026 \" \"We had no official charter,\" said Crocker. \"Most of us were graduate students, and we expected that a professional crew would show up eventually to take over. \u2026\" Of course there were no seasoned veterans; the students and professors had to be their own crew.\n\nThe ARPAnet construction contract was awarded to Bolt Beranek & Newman, a Cambridge-based research firm with close ties to MIT. BBN shipped the new communications software in August 1969 to UCLA and then to SRI in October. At a November demonstration the two California machines exchanged data. The first long-distance packet-switched network was in operation. By the end of the year, all four nodes were on-line.\n\nAt this point the striking figure of Vinton Cerf, the computer scientist The New York Times called the father of the Internet, begins to take a leading role in the narrative. Born in 1943 in New Haven, Cerf turned his back on Yale to do his undergraduate work in mathematics at Stanford and to get his master's and doctorate in computer science from UCLA. In 1969 Cerf was a graduate student working at UCLA's Network Measurement Center, observing how the new fournode ARPAnet was functioning\u2014and what it would take to make it malfunction. \"There were many times when we would crash the network trying to stress it,\" Cerf recalled.\n\nSoon he was collaborating with Robert Kahn, an MIT math professor on leave to work at BBN. Cerf and Kahn developed a set of software \"protocols\" to enable different types of computers to exchange packets, despite varying packet sizes and computer clock speeds. The result, TCP\/IP, was released in 1973 (by which time Cerf was teaching at Stanford). TCP \u2014Transmission Control Protocol\u2014converts messages into packet streams and reassembles them. IP\u2014Internet Protocol\u2014transports the packets across different nodes, even different types of networks. Just as TCP\/IP stands for a whole \"suite of protocols,\" not just those two, so were there several fathers of the Internet; Cerf credits many people, \"thousands by now,\" for helping create the computer-network communications system we've come to know."}

To counteract that, a group drawn from business and government is launching a series of <a href=\" challenges<\/a> aimed at children, with the goal of finding and fostering tomorrow's cyber geniuses. <\/p>\n<p>Britain was once a world leader in cryptography, the science at the core of cybersecurity. In World War II, mathematician <a href=\" Turing<\/a> created a code-breaking device that helped the British war effort tremendously by decoding tens of thousands of secret Nazi communications, giving the Allies an edge on intelligence. After the war, he worked on early attempts at computers, until his life met a <a href=\" premature end<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Today, the United Kingdom has fallen behind in cybersecurity. In part, that's because it faces a shortage of talented workers. Says the Cyber Challenge's websiteWhilst the need for a bright, dedicated, and quick-thinking cyber security workforce is growing, the number of skilled candidates is not. Recent statistics from Microsoft suggest that the IT industry will create 78,000 jobs in the UK in the next four years but research from the government body e-Skills confirms a 50% decline in young UK residents entering IT careers during the last five.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The Cyber Challenge wants to change that.

But not every government is being so patient.

{"text":"University Launches CyLab\n\nThe numbers are startling. Over 114,000 computer virus attacks and computer breaches in 2003. More than $140 billion in damages worldwide, double the previous year.\n\nThe potential damage is even worse. Cascading infrastructure collapses, from communications, to utilities, to emergency response networks, could cripple large regions of the country.\n\nTo lead the fight against cybercrime and cyberterrorism, Carnegie Mellon has launched a university-wide initiative called CyLab. Working with government and industry, it will develop cutting-edge tools, technologies and practices to secure the Internet and telecommunications systems, eliminate computer viruses, and protect one's personal privacy and identity. CyLab will work to ensure safety for every computer user, from individuals at home to small businesses and large corporations.\n\nCyLab's creation makes Carnegie Mellon the only institution with substantial programs in cybersecurity research, education and practice. The lab builds upon Carnegie Mellon's interdisciplinary problem-solving approach, integrating the Center for Computer and Communications Security, the Sustainable Computing Consortium and the Information Networking Institute (INI). It also works closely with CERT\/CC, the world's first and foremost authority on Internet security, which is housed within the Software Engineering Institute.\n\nAltogether, CyLab engages 120 experts in information assurance, public policy, response and prediction, representing the College of Engineering, the School of Computer Science, the Heinz School and CERT\/CC, a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. CERT\/CC is also a partner with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in the activities of U.S.-CERT, a national coordination point to prevent, protect from, and respond to Internet attacks.\n\nCyLab's co-directors are Pradeep Khosla, head of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the INI, and Richard Pethia, director of CERT\/CC. One of their goals over the next three years is to make 10 million people around the world savvy about cybersecurity.\n\n\"Cybersecurity is a problem for all of us,\" said Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon. \"Every time anyone anywhere logs onto a computer, they become part of a network at risk. And, though they may not be aware of it, they contribute to that risk.\"\n\nKhosla stressed the importance of educating the public to recognize and thwart security threats. CyLab's education program will be directed by the INI. Nonprofit organizations, schools and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will assist in disseminating information to the public.\n\nPethia said the increasing occurrences of identity theft and computer viruses have wreaked havoc on computer systems in the past few years. He said the problem won't be solved without advances in technology, and CyLab is expected to lead the way in that endeavor."}

One infamous hacker who appears to have cleaned up his act, demonstrated how caller ID block really works. When you key the command to block your caller ID, all the information about the caller is still available to the phone service provider.

{"text":"Now, since security researchers already have copies of the software this isn't going stop anyone further deconstructing and analysing it. The only possible reason for doing this is to avoid discovery of infection somewhere particularly sensitive. I wonder who the lucky person or nation-state is?\n\nHeckler und Koch GmbH and Rheinmetal AG have licensed factories in Iran. Iranian factories are cranking out G3s, MP5s, MG3s, all legally and for export. Not to mention the various Chinese\/Russian small arms they manufacture (couldn't find out whether those were licensed or not).\n\nI think that, before they ban software companies from doing business in Iran, they should maybe think about banning the firearm companies. Just a thought.\n\nArstechnica.com has more stories on it and how it worked through collision detection and much more. I am amazed yet worried as I am sure malware mobfia folks are using the source code with real NATO grade malware complete with forging certificates, turning zombies into proxy servers, and using the Md5 collision detection done by professional mathematicians.\n\nWorse Ubuntu and other operating systems can be hit by this as they use the same algorithms for the certificates. This piece of malware was just done through conventional 0 day exploits but rather a very sophisticated means of forging certificates and might have done the cyberworld much more harm.\n\nThere are a limited number of possible suspects. First off, not many parties have the means to create this. The consensus is that Flame is one of the largest and most advanced pieces of malware ever created- it's 20 megabytes of code- which strongly implies that it was developed by a nation with an advanced cyber-warfare capability. That list is pretty short, and would include countries like the United States, China, Russia, Israel, and North Korea.\n\nSecond, let's look at the targets. The Flame malware hit Iran, Israel\/Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, in that order. Roughly half of the infections are in Iran. So whoever created Flame is worried about the Middle East, but really, really worried about Iran. More worried about Iran than any other country. The Iran fixation suggests two possible suspects- Israel and the United States.\n\nThe focus on Iran is consistent with Flame coming from the U.S., but Flame also targets several U.S. allies, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The other thing is, Flame doesn't target anything outside of the Middle East. If it was produced by the U.S., you'd expect Flame to be found in other countries- North Korea and Pakistan, for example- where the U.S. has security interests. But whoever created Flame doesn't really care what happens in North Korea or Pakistan. Whoever created Flame is primarily concerned with countries that are either enemies or potential enemies of Israel- Iran, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon. That strongly suggests Israel as the culprit.\n\n1. Because iran has money. 2. Because there are 70 million people in Iran, the vast majority of whom are not engaged in trying to kill americans or europeans. 3. Because lots of people, especially in europe, believe that US sanctions are counter productive, and so don't have such sanctions.\n\nAlso keep in mind there are lots of things that aren't barred from export to Iran, and lots of things are sold legally to other countries and then illegally re-exported to Iran. Most notably to qatar and bahrain, but other places as well.\n\nHave you bothered to read other articles on Flame? It's ability to record and gather information and transmit it back to C&C servers means that it's an excellent tool not just to do large government espionage, but also to listen in on individual conversations. As a tool in a fight against domestic terrorism, and counter espionage. I imagine it would be very effective, it's like a wiretap, without having to ask a judge for a wiretap. Infections in Israel\/Palestine aren't broken down by Israel vs Palestine anywhere I've seen, which may mean that the vast majority are in Palestine. If that's true, it is another pretty large piece of evidence in favor of Israeli authorship.\n\nWhy would you think that they wouldn't spy on their own people, especially with their relationship to the Palestinians? If anything, the fact that it's not showing up in the US would tend to prove the point that it was Israel. The US clearly [slashdot.org] isn't afraid to spy on it's own people.\n\n... it is way too late to get rid of the evidence. I mean, really? Every malware researcher ever must now have a copy of the code.\n\nThe code, sure. But there is still value in hiding what data has been stolen. Destroying the evidence rather than deleting it in a recoverable way means that if a target realises they were infected they will have to assume that everything was taken. That's much worse than knowing exactly what was taken. Consider online store that keeps credit card details for a million users - the difference between knowing that 20 credit card details were leaked and merely knowing that you were infected could well be the difference between surviving as a company or not.\n\nRight but the assumption has always been they don't vandalize their own bots because the owners would then discover they are part of a bot net. That does not hold if the bot net owner is already dismantling the network, I don't know what motivation they have to not nuke the hosts entirely to ensure there don't leave any finger prints.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is they may be concerned that if a large percentage of the public has their machines trashed all at the same time Joe Sixpack of Pakistani mangoes might wake up and start taking computer security seriously. Which could make future bot nets harder to construct."}

Is My Company Vulnerable?\n\nBeware of emails that look legitimate but redirect to strange links\n\nNews that the White House computers were breached by a spearphishing attack have brought a lot more attention to legitimate looking emails with a dangerous payload. While officials downplayed the danger of the attack because the computers affected are not part of the secure network associated with state secrets, any attack can be construed as dangerous because some of the most innocuous pieces of data can be used at a later time in order to gather intelligence, serve as cover for an attack on other computers, or as a way to introduce malware that might be able to spread from one system to another via thumb drives or dirty email attachments. In the same way that citizens during wartime were warned not to speak about troop movements and weapons development, even the most boring information in White House computers could be assembled to indicate where key people were at a certain time, what certain individuals are working on, and the morale of employess. Seemingly harmless items like gossip can often be used to build profiles on important diplomatic and military personnel. Likewise, a corporation subjected to a spearphishing attack might first see low level information taken in preparation for official looking attempts to crack \"inner\" areas which have valuable data, personal information, or technological secrets behind a better firewall.\n\nSpearphishing is a targeted email attack that is designed to target people who are known to frequent specific online businesses. It is called \"spear-phishing\" because the targeting is much more precise and narrow, like the tip of a spear. . In the most recent case, spear-phishing is a suspected goal in the data breach for Epsilon, an online marketer with account information for several major banks, pharmacies, and retail electronics outlets. Although credit card data was not stolen, email addresses were compromised, and these addresses can be sold on the black market for more money because the purchaser knows that people have bought from specific stores in the past. Furthermore, the information gathered from spear-phishing can also beget more sophisticated phishing attacks on customers, who are more likely to trust a legitimate looking message from a retailer\/bank with whom they are already doing business, since the fraudulent email may contain personalized information and customized salutations. Some of the most common targets for spear-phishing (and standard phishing) attacks would be credit card numbers and account logins. For example, an attack may take the reader to a legitimate looking bank site and ask for login information, at which point the bank account username and password will belong to a hacker who can use that access to transfer funds, change account addresses, or and drain all kinds of money from the owner. .\n\nNotes and Special Information\n\nSpecial note: Spear Phishing attacks are often complex so it is important to let your IT and security people know if you suspect one is underway. This will enable them to warn other employees."}

{"text":"Authentication & Fraud Detection\n\nI recently attended the Black Hat USA 2012 in Las Vegas. During the conference, I focused my attention on cyberespionage. This involves attackers who are on a mission with well-defined objectives. They are a source of persistent, targeted attacks. I learned a lot about command and control during my training. Command and control \u2014 also known as C&C or C2 \u2014 is a major component of the cyber kill chain.\n\nI had the opportunity to build two different command-and-control servers during my training at Black Hat \u2014 one with Zeus and one with Poison Ivy. Zeus is designed from the ground up as malware, to facilitate identity theft and to leverage that to steal money or intellectual property.\n\nPoison Ivy is actually called \"Poison Ivy: Remote Administration Tool\" by the author. At one time he expressed shock that it was being used by foreign governments to spy on their own people. It is more suited to remote access and surveillance than to scripted attacks.\n\nThe Zeus server took a long time to set up, partly because of network issues. We started with blank virtual machines (VMs) and built a Linux server from the ground up. The nice thing about that approach is that it makes the build reproducible. With a good network connection, it should be possible to build a server in an hour or two. By contrast, with no preparation, Poison Ivy takes five minutes to set up and deploy.\n\nZeus has exploit capabilities that are well suited to robbing banks; it also has surveillance capabilities and many add-ons. Backconnect \u2014 an optional plug-in module for Zeus that provides additional capabilities \u2014 makes it possible to proxy traffic through the victim's computer. Integration with instant messaging via Jabber helps the attacker get to a keyboard when a window of opportunity opens up.\n\nSetting up a botnet is surprisingly quick, so an intruder could easily learn and deploy several technologies in their attack. Infecting multiple systems with different technologies, using different attack vectors, would help the attacker maintain a foothold after an intrusion is discovered.\n\nA bot can be transferred from one C2 server to another. Thieves are starting to sell bots to spies. Malware that comes in via typical, untargeted channels can later be used to leverage a targeted attack. It's important for an organization to know if they have a typical infection or are under a targeted attack. It's like knowing the difference between an ear infection and cancer, as you will see in my post about remediation.\n\nWhile it's quite typical for my blogs to take shots at the banks for failing to implement effective security controls, and at the financial regulators for being too slow at releasing guidelines, I think it's time to emphasize that fighting fraud is a team effort.\n\nBy coincidence, my last blog entry, in early July, ended with this exact recommendation. Within a week, news came out that a bank, BankcorpSouth, is suing their customer for failing to adopt security controls, which made it easy for criminals to steal about $400,000.\n\nBlogmaster Note: This was originally posted on July 17, 2012 to ComputerWorld UK's Security Spotlight Blog.\n\nUS ruling has implications for UK over bank's liability\n\nThefts from a construction company in Sanford, Maine might be the catalyst for much-needed improvements to banking security. The US First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a decision that said that a bank was not at fault in a theft. Even better, the appeals court encouraged both parties to settle the matter amongst themselves.\n\nHere's a summary. In May, 2009, the Sanford, Maine construction company PATCO Construction had its on-line banking credentials stolen, most likely through the ZeuS malware. The thieves stole US$588,000 from PATCO's accounts at Ocean Bank, now People's United Bank. The thefts were batched in automated clearing house withdrawals over seven days.\n\nOcean Bank recovered US$243,406 of the losses, leaving PATCO with losses of $345,445. To add insult to injury, the withdrawals exceeded the cash on hand that PATCO had in their account and Ocean Bank gave them an automatic line of credit to cover the theft, charging them interest on the losses as well.\n\nIn 2010, PATCO sued Ocean Bank for the losses, claiming that among other things Ocean Bank did not follow the existing US banking requirements for multifactor authentication, relying on a simple password to authenticate and verify transactions.\n\nThe ruling is important because it states that Ocean Bank was \"commercially unreasonable\" in what it offered to PATCO. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, not only must we customers be responsible, but the banks must meet the new (where new means 2005) guidelines of the FFIEC. Ocean Bank was using the Cyota system through a service, but did not offer out-of-band authentication, tokens, or monitoring.\n\nWhile this is a US ruling, the basics apply to the UK as well. Ross Anderson has been noting for years that UK banking requires proper authentication and without it, the bank must eat the losses. He has even documented how he sued his bank to recover a loss on his own account in his article, \"How to get money back from a bank \".\n\nIf you're with a financial institution, make sure you offer good authentication. Read the articles I've linked to. Call us at Entrust, we've been helping financial institutions with these systems throughout the English-speaking world. If you don't want to call us, call someone else. It's not hard to do, you just have to do it.\n\nWhile one would be foolish to say we can now rest on our laurels, I think it time to pause and celebrate some very tangible progress in the fight against online fraud. July 3, 2012 marked the end of a very interesting yearlong journey for Patco, a Maine-based construction company who became the victim of an online fraud attack that pilfered more than $500,000 from their commercial bank account.\n\nAfter suing Ocean Bank for poor security controls, and ultimately responsibility for the fraud losses, the US District court of Maine ruled in favor of the bank in June of last year. Basically claiming caveat emptor; the court felt Patco Construction agreed to the bank's security methods when they signed their commercial contract and were, therefore, aware of the risks at hand. While in my mind, the ruling underscored the sad state of affairs in the world of online fraud (for insight check out my previous blog post ) we have really come a long way in the past 12 months.\n\nHere is a snapshot of several key developments since then:\n\nJune 28, 2011\nThe FFIEC released new (stronger) guidance reinforcing the risk-management framework originally put in place several years earlier. This new guidance directly addresses the security control deficiencies at Ocean Bank.\n\nJuly 11, 2011\nIn a similar online fraud court case, a Dallas-based court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Experi-Metal, claiming that their bank, Comerica, should have had better fraud detection controls in place.\n\nA natural extension to my last post, I find it interesting that most people intuitively see the need to secure mobile devices, applications and transactions, but they are likely unaware of the incredible power and convenience mobile devices present in terms of serving as a security device themselves.\n\nIncreasingly, mobile devices are used for more and more tasks \u2014 the first application was voice calls, then email, calendars and texting, work use, personal use, social use; the list seems endless. Newer use-cases highlight mobile devices as a payment method to buy our coffee, and Apple will soon introduce a new application called Passbook in their iOS 6 release, which will help manage all your loyalty cards, boarding passes, event tickets, gift cards and more. Now, imagine extending the power of your mobile phone to provide secure access \u2014 a virtual key, so to speak \u2014 to the things you want to protect in both the online and physical world. Read the rest of this entry \u00bb\n\nAmerican Banker published a great article last week covering some of JPMorgan's security strategies for mobile banking. Lloyd O'Conner explained the importance of layering multiple security technologies to protect their clients \u2014 as well as their own company \u2014 from the growing cyberthreats that not only target the online channel but are zoning in on the mobile channel as well.\n\nAuthenticating the user to the application and encrypting the communication channel.\n\nWhile I agree 100 percent with JPMorgan \u2014 after all, they are demonstrating clear innovation and leadership in mobile banking here \u2014 I think there is another layer that needs to be called out as well.\n\nWhile varied identity authentication layers are critical, some forms of advanced fraud attacks (e.g., man-in-the-browser) have proven to defeat a broad range of authentication approaches. Adding real-time fraud detection to flush out behavior anomalies is a critical layer to help detect MITB and, fortunately, is totally transparent to the mobile user.\n\nBy deploying a layered security framework, FIs can help defeat advanced MITB malware attacks. This approach not only provides world-class fraud prevention, but also helps enhance the end-user experience.\n\nBrian Krebs scooped a major story yesterday about a potential major credit card breach at a U.S.-based payment processor affecting both VISA and MasterCard.\n\nThe news made headlines across top media outlets for good reason: this is NOT the first major credit card breach. 2011 saw a wrath of breaches including Epsilon and Sony, not to mention the \"out-of-control\" card-skimming fraud that is going on throughout the USA prompting FBI involvement.\n\nNot unlike robbing banks, forging checks or conducting online fraud, criminals find the weak link in security systems and put plans in place to exploit them. Unfortunately, the industry has known for decades that magnetic stripe cards offer poor security protection, and with the shift toward using cards for online payments, it's no wonder we're reading about new breaches on a weekly basis.\n\nFortunately, technology exists that helps dramatically improve credit card security \u2014 it's called EMV or chip-based credit cards. EMV allows for an encrypted security key to be contained within the chip on the credit card, thereby making card-skimming or duplication virtually impossible; or at the very least, extremely difficult, impractical and uneconomical for a criminal to execute. As well, implementations support the concept of a user PIN to help prevent card use when a card is physically lost or stolen. Read the rest of this entry \u00bb\n\nLet me be clear right up front. Yes, cybersecurity threats are real. Yes, they are growing in volume and in sophistication. And, yes, they are the root of the problem. BUT, one of the underlying frustrations I have with the cyber-threat situation is that, in general, many organizations remain anything but creative and strategic when it comes to implementing effective security measures.\n\nWe see both extremes. At one end, we have strong security measures that create nothing but havoc and frustration for end-users. And at the other, we see companies implement incredibly weak security measures because they are so careful not to burden their customers with hindrances to the online experience. The net result is similar \u2014 users bear the wrath of the security measure and either the pain of using it, or the pain of not having it effectively protect their identities and online assets.\n\nAs mentioned in my last post, with organized crime groups clearly focused on the mobile channel, financial institutions will increasingly need to roll out strong security. But, they also need to be mindful of the impact that security has on the user experience.\n\nAt a recent conference, I had the pleasure of attending a session hosted by a SVP of security at one of the largest banks in the US. He discussed the current state of cybercrime threats and security challenges, but I was encouraged to hear him also devote considerable time to the importance of the customer experience. He then made what I consider to be a profound statement that applies to virtually every company in today's Internet age: \"Delight or disappoint and they will tweet, and they will blog and the social momentum will take off.\"\n\nSo how does a bank best approach delighting their customers giving the opportunities and threats associated with Internet- and mobile-based service offerings? I think it's safe to say many banks have shied away from tackling the problem until now \u2014 mostly employing a \"do little approach\" to protecting their online and mobile customer base.\n\nA recent article on Bank Information Security's website discusses a Javelin report, \"Banking Identity Safety Scorecard,\" which concludes that banks still rely on \"old authentication\" techniques and have failed to properly vet new mobile applications and services. One of the primary reasons? Banks are sensitive to introducing anything that may add potential customer frustration. Unfortunately, what they fail to realize is that cybercrime is impacting the customer experience and corporate brand. Just take a look at the wrath of major breaches this year and you'll see why. Read the rest of this entry \u00bb\n\nI had the privilege to participate in a mobile security panel session yesterday and it's clear, from the spirit of the questions and the conference buzz in general, that securing the mobile channel is top-of-mind for many security professionals. This includes employees accessing corporate networks as well as customers embracing the mobile banking\/commerce revolution."}

{"text":"Facebook Targeted in 'Sophisticated Attack'With Congress facing an impasse over new legislation to strengthen the country's defenses against cyberattacks, President Obama is widely expected to issue an executive order mandating new cybersecurity provisions.\n\nThat order, which could be promulgated in the coming weeks, would likely call on private-sector companies\u2014but not compel them\u2014to improve their coordination with government authorities as new threats and attacks materialize.\n\nBut even though many of the proposals in the anticipated executive order would not amount to binding directives, any White House action on cybersecurity will likely be met with sharp criticism from congressional Republicans, many of whom have been vocal in their opposition to any measure that would expand government oversight over digital infrastructure owned and operated by the private sector \"So I call on President Obama and his administration to disavow any attempts to bypass the checks and balances of Congress when we're addressing these issues.

They include a marketing company in Texas and a personal website belonging to a well-known political figure in Washington. He catalogs the malware he finds into categories, which usually correspond to particular hacking teams in China. He says around 10 teams have deployed 300 malware groups, double the count of 10 months ago. \"There is a tremendous amount of manpower being thrown at this from their side,\" he says.\n\nInvestigators at dozens of commercial security companies suspect many if not most of those hackers either are military or take their orders from some of China's many intelligence or surveillance organizations. In general, they say the attacks are too organized and the scope too vast to be the work of freelancers.\"\n\n\u2026big snip\u2026.\n\nAs Stewart discusses this, his voice is flat. He's realistic. Outing one person involved in the hacking teams won't stop computer intrusions from China. Zhang's a cog in a much larger machine and, given how large China's operations have become, finding more Zhangs may get easier. Show enough of this evidence, Stewart figures, and eventually the Chinese government can't deny its role\n\nI've noticed a very marked increase in hack attempts from Chinese IPs recently. There's a strange covert war going on beneath the HTTP surface.\n\nI've been wondering for a while about what is really going on about all these reports of China-originated hacking.\n\n\"China\" is a big place with lots of people.\n\nThose of us in the English language corner of the internet may not notice it, but Chinese language internet sites\/services have grown to dominate.\n\nThough there is no absolute measure of these things, there are more internet users in China than there are in the US. Especially if you count smart phones.\n\nI suspect that individual Chinese who are embedded in a culture of hyper-competition are attempting to make a name for themselves. Some may be carrying cultural crosses, trying to prove themselves to the western worldAttempts to get companies to report cyber attacks against them have been blocked for years. No company wants to go on record that their infrastructure isn't secure if they don't have to.\n\nThe problem is there's no absolute security. You can't make a system hackproof. You can make it very hard, but almost all systems can be cracked by the simple social hack of mailing a bunch of USB sticks to the VPs from some made up company. They'll go ahead and stick them into their secure, protected computers and with physical access you can get deep control. You can get antiviruses to scan shit like that but it's a very imperfect defense.\n\nIt's really rare that a corporation can have the culture of security that's necessary. The network security is necessary but people have to abide by the rules, and most places will find consistent rulebreaking since computer security generally interferes with how people do their job.\n\nThat was one significant bolide today over Chelyabinsk. The shockwave occurred between 2 and 2 and 1\/2 minutes after the initial breakup, indicating an altitude of between 125,00 and 150,00 feet. The contrail itself was around three hundred miles long. (perspective is an odd thing, yes?).\n\nOver a million square feet of glass was shattered in the city. The object was approximately 50 feet in diameter and was probably a chondroid (most objects are), but we can hope for a Palasite body (beautiful stuff).\n\nThe altitude of the the breakup caused most of the injuries.

Many people said it was a baseless arrest, and one which was fiction turned into reality by a western government conspiracy.\n\nStaying true to their promise, the group began to attack companies or groups who had severed ties to WikiLeaks, including Visa, Mastercard and the Swiss Post Office bank.\n\n\"Operation Payback stands for free speech and no censorship, which is also what Assange is going for,\" the Anonymous organizers said. \"Whether we see him as a crusader or martyr, his goals are ultimately ours.\n\n\"When we think we made our point (e.g. WikiLeaks accepted as whistleblower, without fear that they will be prosecuted), we will return to fighting 'copywrong,'\" they said.\n\nWell, it seems like this was only the beginning of a highly publicized number of hacker attacks that have plagued the web since that fateful day.\n\n\"Anonymous\" would then move onto breaking into HBGary Federal, stealing countless email messages and temporarily routing traffic to another page.\n\nIf they're going to hack, I think they shouldn't affect other people's credit card numbers and things. I do believe that they are doing the right things, but since they want to punish the COMPANIES who are irritating, they should do things like, for example, if hacking into a game site, make EVERYONE the max level, or if hacking into a bank, change the passwords of the top GMs, and their tech support, so they cannot change it back. Basically, I think they want to affect the companies, not the people, since the people did nothing wrong.\n\nThe young hackers maybe study some sort of computer science and they off course feel great that they are able to crack through the security of any site or company for ****n to show off their capability. But those mature hacker like Julian Assange exposing many countries secret, is not really mature in the sense that there might cause world war, and how many people will die for it.\n\nThe worst type is the hacker who meant $$$, stealing Credit card number and bank account to gain from there, is definitely a criminal case"}
{"text":"The Internet of today is not the Internet of years past. It is an evolving entity that has a taken on a life of its own. When most Americans refer to the Internet, they refer to a mythic entity that has Web sites such as  applications such as Twitter and wikis, ubiquitous connections to personal computers and handheld devices, and that is searchable by entering terms in a form field. Many articles have covered the basic evolution of the Internet from its origins in ARPANET and academia, and books such as \"Fire in the Valley\" by Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine have covered the explosive growth of personal computing. The issuance of \"dot\" names was once under U.S. government purview, as was the funding of the first browsers and networks, and the first centers with Web sites, but no longer.\n\nThis seed planted by the Defense Department, watered by a computer revolution starting in the 1970s, and fed by the fiber-optic network and dot-com bubbles of the 1990s and now the handheld revolution of today, has resulted in a vast and more complex Internet. The common element is Internet Protocol (IP). An IP address is a connected device's identity on any IP network. If it has batteries or a power cord, it also likely has an IP address: servers, handheld devices, ATMs, cable-TV boxes, credit-card readers, door locks, hospital medical devices, and in some cases, a personal computer.\n\nGovernment networks are small and nondiverse compared with the Internet, and many government networks are in some way dependent upon the Internet, by design or not, separated or not. Therefore, efforts to secure and protect the cyber-realm must include people with expertise in the larger Internet to protect the global economic infrastructure, and to incorporate that diverse expertise into government networks. This article will explain the complexities and weaknesses of the current Internet, groups that actually control the Internet and its standards, common enemies of Internet and government IP networks, and ways to better secure government and our economic infrastructure.\n\nTo understand the Internet and its security needs, without delving into techno-babble, it is best to resort to a scenario from antiquity. A merchant in Beijing needs to deliver cargo regularly to his agent in Rome. To perform these deliveries, the merchant contracts with a local Beijing caravan company. The caravan company can use many routes to Rome and back, each route requiring the company to pay other caravan companies to fulfill the order. The merchant does not care with whom the caravan company contracts; he is only interested in the drop-off point, security, time and cost for delivery. The Beijing caravan company typically contracts with one of several Silk Road caravans to bring the load from the eastern end of the Silk Road, Turfan, to its western end, Constantinople. Every Silk Road caravan company requires standard packaging and addressing on any loads it carries, and has more expertise, and uses the more and stronger camels, than any non-Silk Road caravan company. The Beijing caravan company contracts with one of these Silk Road caravan companies to complete the delivery to and from Rome, to carry not just the Beijing merchant's goods, but also those of other merchants in the Beijing to Turfan region. Note that the Silk Road caravan does not ever meet the Beijing merchant, nor know the cargo's contents once packaged. In fact, the Silk Road caravan will bundle loads from many smaller caravans for the long trek across the Silk Road. The Silk Road caravan plans for eventuality, and has agreements among its peers to swap loads to ensure deliveries. Caravan masters, in addition to managing camel traffic on the Road, determine how and when to implement agreed swaps. Further, caravan masters determine which camels are purchased to carry loads, and all camel vendors aspire to provide camels to the Silk Road caravans. At the Silk Road's terminus in Constantinople, the Silk Road caravan will break up the loads to go to their various destinations, including Rome, using other caravans to complete delivery. Ideally, Silk Road caravans want eastbound and westbound trips to have full loads. In the end, the Beijing merchant doesn't know exactly how his loads are delivered to Rome, just that they usually arrive, usually on time.\n\nAll the dynamics of the Internet can be seen in the Silk Road scenario. The basic principles that constitute the Internet would not have been alien to our ancient merchant. Our \"Silk Road\" is a fiber-optically connected series of router clusters. Each major city has at least one cluster per backbone ISP. A backbone ISP's cluster has routers that face other ISPs for load swapping, and a very few that direct traffic inside the backbone ISP. These backbone routers, our \"camels,\" are specialized supercomputers that direct Internet routes. Each city is a Constantinople or Turfan in our example. Controlling the routes on the Internet is accomplished by controlling a very few of these routers, since the routers share information among themselves and among ISPs. Peering agreements officially define contact points between ISPs. These agreements, combined with the protocols and standards associated with IP and, more importantly, their actual implementation in routes, form the Internet infrastructure. One view of these peering arrangements for the Internet can be found on the Internet Health Report site at \n\nStrategically, the physical and logical worlds are linked, as with the Silk Road, and physical security is tied to logical security. Key router clusters for most ISPs, backbone or not, are situated in a finite number of shared buildings in major cities. A sprinkler-pipe break in one of these facilities can cause damage resulting in the loss of many thousands of libraries worth of information for many ISPs before redundancy takes over. These buildings are connected using shared fiber-optic bundles that often follow common easements. A typical backbone connection between major cities for one backbone ISP, and there are several connections per route, carries a load equivalent to more than 25,000 novels (five gigabytes) every second. The same can be said of the fiber bundles under the oceans or communications satellites in space. A private network does not escape this physical structure. The underlying routes for private networks, i.e., private and secure from the Internet, also ride this common fiber-optic and facility infrastructure. Just because a \"private network\" appears on paper to be a physically separated network does not mean the fibers or routes of that network don't share a conduit with the fiber carrying your publicly IP-routed music download. A sloppy backhoe or undersea earthquake can knock down key routes for many IP networks, to the dismay of millions of users, private or not.\n\nCybersecurity strategy, government and commercial, must therefore include a detailed understanding of the private and public IP infrastructure, physical and logical, and must include tested processes for securing and documenting it, adopted from industry and government best practice. Continually updated documentation is a key to securing the terrain.\n\nOur allies\n\nAbout 300 master backbone network engineers, under various titles, regardless of organization chart, truly control the ebb and flow of traffic on the global Internet. They are the caravan masters of our Silk Road, and are experienced and powerful allies. These same engineers control public and private Internet networks. Like the caravan masters of old, the master network engineers are not executives, but their word becomes law for all other IP engineers and operators. They design in the redundancy, they dictate security, they author standards and they often operate the network directly by commanding the routers. They meet at group conferences to decide the protocols and address policies that rule the Internet. These groups are not familiar to most Internet users but they are:\n\n\u00e5 The North American Network Operators Group (NANOG), an educational forum for information related to backbone\/enterprise networking technologies.\n\nNetwork engineers communicate continually using instant messaging. In these conversations, they balance the traffic on the Internet by swapping thousands of bundled routes, billions of bytes at a time. Additionally, the caravan masters of the backbone ISPs drop rotten cargo at the roadside quickly. In the cases of child pornography, spam or hacker activity, a call between key backbone ISP network engineers can end all traffic in and out of entire ISPs well before any legal action is taken. The personal bonds of trust between these engineers are forged by working together at various companies, building and maintaining networks, and battling hackers and spammers. Some are military communications veterans or (former) white-hat hackers. All are post-dot-com-bubble survivors. They hold the keys to all major backbone routers and in turn, the keys of the public and the private Internet. These engineers are the key to Internet-wide change and security.\n\nThe Internet also has camel breeders and cargo providers, each listening to the caravan masters. Equipment vendors, such as Cisco and Juniper, and application providers, such as Microsoft and Google, have strong influences on the Internet and any IP-using network, but they largely listen to the backbone network engineers. Major equipment vendors on the Internet, who also provide hardware for military networks, listen first to the backbone ISP network engineers, then to anyone else. Why? The master network engineer always strongly influences what hardware, by the thousands of units, a backbone ISP will buy, and in turn what the smaller ISPs such as the Defense Department, will also buy. A vendor must therefore have a presence in at least one backbone to prosper. Application providers act similarly. The backbones are routed to manage major application traffic; network engineers must control the routes this traffic takes to balance their ISP networks. Since the backbone network engineers know the Internet market intimately because of interaction with ISP customers and traffic analysis, these engineers provide priceless feedback to the application providers and equipment vendors. Equipment vendors and application providers, hoping to court favor with the caravan masters, attend the same group conferences as the backbone network engineers.\n\nFor our cybersecurity effort, our strategy must include input from a significant sample of the master backbone ISP network engineers, key application providers and equipment vendors. Security policies for the Internet and government networks should include input from, and to, ICANN, IETF, CERT, IEEE and NANOG.\n\nOur enemies shared\n\nU.S. government networks and backbone ISPs share many enemies, some due to contact, most due to villainous desire. Often it is the case that \"isolated\" government networks share a link to the Internet, by protocol or by connection. The contact point for a government network can also be a warrior's iPod, a civilian's USB fob, or a contractor's wireless adapter. One of the thousands of backbone routers on a major backbone ISP moves trillions of bytes of data hourly, for billions of end users, over hundreds of thousands of routes globally. Each backbone router therefore is an irresistible target, attacked often. Imagine a professional hacker controlling just one of these major routers. Such a miscreant could not only disrupt the economy on a vast scale, just by controlling the routes and populating them to other routers, but could also pull in Internet traffic to sample for sensitive data, or send as a tsunami at any connected server or network. Motivations may differ between backbone ISP assailants and Defense Department-targeting hackers, but both have enemies seeking to weaken infrastructures, to deny access, to obtain information and to sow disorder.\n\nCombined attacks pose a real threat. A savvy foe may decide to combine a physical attack to hit a military unit and, at the same time, launch a logical attack to disable the civil infrastructure, as Russia did in its Georgia campaigns in the summer of 2008. A terrorist could use a small physical attack to gain access to the backbone infrastructure, then connect into military networks, and then launch a logical attack against all other connected military networks. Many nightmares follow.\n\nOur cybersecurity efforts must account for such combined attack scenarios, physical and logical, military network and Internet. Both sides, simultaneously, must be explored. We must also include the lessons learned from defending the Internet infrastructure to date.\n\nThe Internet is a vital and ubiquitous entity, ruled by common protocols and experience, from which national cybersecurity efforts must draw. Strategically, we must secure the Internet backbone, our modern Silk Road. Efforts must involve groups and individuals that run networks much larger and more diverse then any government network. As a result, our cybersecurity efforts must:\n\n\u00e5 Develop a secure repository of current key physical and logical infrastructure documentation, using Web technology and automation. This should include maps, contact lists and processes. We must have strategies to secure physical key points in the event of attack.\n\n\u00e5 Partner with academia on the creation of cyberarchitecture security and assurance educational programs that grow the expertise and passion that industry and government need \u2014 to include cyberfellowship programs to bring together industry and government, i.e., bring in industry-class working network engineers to enhance government security efforts on a rotational basis. Government engineers and decision makers should rotate into the major backbones to learn in the larger Internet.\n\n\u00e5 Determine the cybersecurity overlaps and separations between the government, industry and the federally funded centers of expertise \u2014 so that we can focus our respective expertise in a comprehensive and complementary body of knowledge, skill sets, technologies and approaches.\n\n\u00e5 Develop combined response exercises and scenarios with industry, especially the backbone ISPs, to deal with national or globally sized attacks against the Internet.\n\nGiven these initial steps, our cybersecurity strategy can be placed on the right footing to defend our modern Silk Road.\n\nBryce L.

Too much noise is not a good thing; a busy atmosphere is enjoyable though. To overcome this problem, John Paluska designed a system for his new restaurant to dampen the uproar.\nA system of over twenty eight over head microphones pick up the sound from the air and then adjust the sound automatically, playing it back to keep the noise at an appropriate level. Individuals as well as the bartender can adjust the sound to a more erratic lever or keep it down for a more relaxing feeling.\nIn a setting like\u2026\n\nStanding on Earth, gravity is holding everything down. We tend to take for granted that this invisible force is keeping us alive. What most of us do not know is how this force affects space time. Regardless of the fact that gravity can hold us to the ground, it can also affect how time flows. Gravity is more than what meets the eye.\nEvery object has gravitational forces. Every atom has this attractive force. The more mass an object has the greater its gravity will be. Because every object possesses this force, when huge masses are near each other, they will affect each other in certain ways.

{"text":"WiFi Crime in Illinois\n\nThe Rockford Register Star has a story about a man who was convicted of a crime for using the unencrypted wireless network of a nearby non-profit agency without first obtaining the agency's permission. The article doesn't say, but I gather the prosecution was brought under the Illinois computer misuse statute, which prohibits unauthorized access to a computer. The prosecution appears to have been a largely symbolic one for deterrent effect: the defendant pled guilty and received a $250 fine plus a year of court supervision, and the prosecutors released statements to the press about how this should be a warning to others.\n\nI have written a long law review article on when access to a computer network should be consider \"unauthorized,\" and I won't repeat the argument here. But one of the interesting stories in criminal law in the last decade or so is the remarkably expansive interpretation courts have given to these new computer misuse statutes. Much of the problem is that the federal statute has civil remedies, and businesses have used these remedies to get federal jurisdiction in all sorts of spats over competitors and opponents. Courts are much more likely to construe the language broadly in civil cases than in criminal cases: it takes a lot less to convince a judge to stop a sneaky business practice than it does to convince a judge to put someone in jail for that practice.\n\nA good example is the recent Posner opinion in International Airports v. Citrin, which adopts the remarkable position that an employee who uses his employer's computer with a subjective intent to help his employer's competitor is committing an unauthorized access under federal law. Under Posner's view, the statute acts as sort of a nationwide employee loyalty test. Maybe there is an argument that this makes sense in civil cases, but it seems like an astonishing interpretation for a criminal statute.\n\n7 Responses to WiFi Crime in Illinois\n\nAs a response to the general matter: I think the trouble revolves around how an individual is expected to determine whether access is authorized.\n\nLet us say that we adopt the position that connecting to unsecured wireless networks without express permission is illegal.\n\nThen what are we to make of someone who runs a service that allows anyone on his local network to download files. Now say that he hasn't given his permission to anyone to connect to and use this access. Further say that legally acquired but copyrighted material is accessible as a result.\n\nIs the individual liable for unauthorized distributing copyrighted material?\n\nAnd simultaneously an individual accessing the information would be guilty of misuse?\n\nHow is the accessing individual to know that access is not available by intention and that the network owner had the necessary rights to distribute the information thus available?\n\nComputer misuse statutes seem to be stuck in the \"war-dailing\" era of computing where intentions were essentially universally aligned with providing restricted access to scarce, expensive resources and proprietary information.\n\n[OK Comments: Much of this concern is addressed through mens rea requirements, such as intent, knowledge, etc.]\n\nWhoever . . . intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, causes damage . . . shall be punished . . . .\n\nOrin, are you saying that the person has to intend not only to access the computer, but intend that such access be unauthorized? (Haven't read your article yet, sorry.) If not, then I think Paul's hypothetical has some force. A lot of people don't care whether their neighbors (as opposed to wardrivers) access their WiFi network. Absent other cues (e.g., SSID hasn't been changed from default, indicating neophyte user), how is a neighbor supposed to tell if access is authorized or not?\n\n[OK Comments: Yes, the mens rea applies to authorization as well as access. For the most part, \"access\" is merely use; essentially all access is intentional access. The crux of the issue is the mens rea for the lack of authorization.]\n\nPosner is basically saying that the second an agent breaches his fiduciary duty to his principal, the agent is no longer authorized to access the computer the principal gave to the agent to carry out the principal's objectives. \"Citrin's breach of his duty of loyalty terminated his agency relationship \u2026 and with it his authority to access the laptop, because the only basis of his authority had been that relationship.\"\n\nWould this reasoning really extend to any employee \"who uses his employer's computer with a subjective intent to help his employer's competitor\"?\n\nThe issue that you're wrestling with, both in the post and in the NYU piece, is the issue of boundaries. Colloquially, network and computer administrators and users expect to implement them and to encounter and navigate them. Implicitly, computer crime statutes (and other access-regulating regimes, including but not limited to contract law) assume that they exist and can be identified. The debate is over how to do so, both ex ante and ex post, given the fact that the law rarely lays this out explicitly. I put my own views, which focus on civil litigation rather than criminal law, in a piece in the Boston College Law Review that was published around the same time as the NYU article.\n\nWhat you're suggesting is an excellent idea. In fact, it solves a whole host of problems if applied in a wider context.\n\nI've argued for years that the Internet ought to adopt a \"fencing out\" legal standard. States in the western U.S. that have a ranching tradition are either \"fencing in\" or \"fencing out\" states. If you are a cattle rancher in a \"fencing in\" state, the onus is on you to fence your cattle in so that they will not harm the property of others. If, however, you live in a \"fencing out\" state, the cattle roam free and the burden is on the landowner to protect his property by building a fence around it.\n\nThe same standard ought to be applied to the Internet. Not only does this address the \"unauthorized access\" problem, it addresses deep linking, bandwidth \"theft,\" a variety of copyright issues, etc.\n\nThe default state of the Internet ought to be freedom and unfettered access. If someone wants to limit access to their websites and servers, the burden ought to be on them, especially since the technological means to do so are readily available. The law ought to be invoked only when someone intentionally circumvents the owner's \"fence.\"\n\nOTS, I think your proposal isn't all that helpful without a far more articulated description of \"fence\" and \"circumvention.\"\n\nIt is no secret that most home PCs (Wintel boxes, anyway) are unsecured against numerous exploits. Worse, new exploits emerge on a daily basis. Under a \"fence out\" approach, am I simply SOL if \u2014 despite my best efforts, including installing current security patches and running a firewall \u2014 a network intruder (or, more likely, a worm) succeeds in rooting my machine?\n\nThe kind of intrusions you're talking about typically involve installing a piece of code on the compromised machine \u2014 it's not a question of simple \"access.\" To continue the analogy, if you fail to build a fence, you neighbor's cattle can roam across your property. But that doesn't mean your neighbor can use your property to build a barn for them."}
{"text":"The past 20 years has witnessed the boom of commercial internet and, as a result, the development of an interconnected and global digital network.\n\nThis has made everything from email and social networking to telemedicine and online banking and retailing, simply part of everyday life. The internet has also provided huge opportunity for the economy, allowing smaller businesses to target international customers previously out of reach.\n\nWith vital day-to-day activities so dependent on the internet, cyber space has become the 'nervous system' through which society operates. Open networks connect the world, facilitate economic exchanges across regions and promote global trade. In short, information technology has become a key driver behind economic growth.\n\nYet, as the personal and enterprise-oriented benefits of the internet, from social networking to cloud computing, have become clear, equally clear is that real-world evils ranging from vandalism, theft and disruption to espionage and wilful destruction have gravitated to the new digital environment.\n\nNot a day goes by that we don't hear about cyber threats. This concern is understandable, and has become more prevalent since the growth in smartphone usage.\n\nIn a world where over 87 per cent of the world's population are mobile users, cyber security is a growing challenge demanding rational and universal solutions.\n\nAs governments, enterprises and consumers have become reliant on the internet, the scale of the cyber security challenge has grown exponentially.\n\nIn addition, increasingly rich telecommunications and internet applications have become widely available and are increasingly used in business. This, coupled with the growth of cloud computing and the increasing use of app stores, means the complexity and scale of ICT-related software is rapidly expanding.\n\nAs such, malicious collection of personal data and unintended design errors all potentially cause damage to the network and its users. For example, the global growth in social networks has created major security challenges with one survey claiming that in England and Wales a Facebook crime occurs every 40 minutes, with some 12,300 cases linked to the site.\n\nThis is not an indication of the cyber security provided by the social network, but of how innocent social media technology can be misused or abused.\n\nSimply put, as the usage of smartphones has increased, so too have the motives and methods of attacking them. Between 2004 and 2011, the prevalence of malware in smartphones increased by 600 per cent. This could seriously undermine the undoubted benefits offered by these devices.\n\nTo counteract this threat, businesses, security experts, governments and indeed all stakeholders need to ensure that trust is maintained and relationships, processes and approaches continually evolve to meet the digital challenges of the 21st century and beyond.\n\nCyber security is not a single country or specific company issue. All stakeholders \u2013 governments and industry alike \u2013 need to recognise that cyber security is a shared global problem requiring risk-based approaches, best practices and international cooperation to address the challenge.\n\nDespite the continued effort of cyber criminals to find new ways of attacking businesses and consumers alike, we should not assume there is nothing that can be done to meet the cyber security challenge.\n\nVerizon's 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) affirms for the fourth year in a row that the majority of data breaches (97 per cent) could have been avoided with the implementation of simple countermeasures.\n\nIn short, there is much we can do if we show collective will, determination, openness and transparency. The technology landscape is complex, and is getting more so, given the growing role of smartphones and cloud computing and the extensive use of application stores that contain software developed around the world to differing quality and security standards.\n\nIn order to adequately address cyber security issues, the private and public sectors must align goals and responsibilities and collaborate to ensure the integrity and security of data and information systems within a risk-based framework.\n\nCollaboration on cyber security should not be limited by geographical, political or competitive differences. While some may view it as a competitive advantage, the reality is the impact of not collaborating provides the opportunity to exploit the weak links in the global cyber security chain. There are multiple forums available for collaboration, yet even these are the equivalent of loose cooperation and do not fulfil a true comprehensive united front.\n\nIn this context governments must take the lead to establish united and integrated governance to drive forward comprehensive and collaborative approaches to cyber security.\n\nWith governments leading the charge and the security industry supporting, we can form a united front against cyber crime and ensure we are one step ahead, as technology continues to play a bigger role in society"}

Many of his clients, he said, are employers who suspect the theft of digital information from the workplace.\n\nAt age 44, McCartney has worked more than half his life in law enforcement for the U.S. Attorney's and New York Attorney General's offices. He spent much time investigating high-profile crimes including narcotics smuggling, child pornography and terrorist rings. These days, McCartney and partner James Domres practice a different kind of surveillance. Their services are in demand.\n\nPeople Talk: You basically are a private investigation firm.\n\nMichael McCartney: This firm is a PI firm, but we don't go out and do surveillance on the spouse who's cheating on her husband.We look at the employee who's cheating on the employer.\n\nPT: Tell me about your clients.\n\nMMC: Very few ever go to the police. Then they would lose control, and their problem becomes public. They would rather hire us to solve their problem by Friday, and be confidential about it. We look under all the rocks the cops look under.\n\nMMC: Yes we did. The biggest strength law enforcement has is the power of subpoena, and the ability to empanel a grand jury and issue grand jury subpoenas. So a lot of the information we try to get is protected. But if civil litigation is pending, we do have subpoena power.\n\nMMC: No, I'm secure. I know the extent of security-- how far it can go -- and I employ it. But you're never completely secure with a computer unless it's turned off, unplugged and in the back of your closet.\n\nPT: What was your retirement plan before this?\n\nMMC: Before this? I was just being a law enforcement guy, so I probably would have worked security at the Bills games.\n\nPT: Describe your personality.\n\nMMC: I'm very organized, committed, driven, tenacious. It's a strange personality type that gets driven to law enforcement. I'm really a frustrated lawyer. I read case law as a hobby. I follow the Supreme Court. I really enjoy the analysis behind judge's decisions.\n\nPT: Were you a hobbyist?\n\nMMC: I was always a tinkerer, took stuff apart to try and figure it out. I'm an avid sailor, been sailing since I was kid. I still race on Tuesday nights on Lake Erie.\n\nPT: What would you never put on your computer?\n\nMMC: I'm a victim of habit, as you can see. I think that email is the killer for a lot of people. People say really stupid things in email, fortunately for us. I think it becomes so casual. Email exists in no less than four places: in the machine you created it on, on the server you sent it through, on the recipient's server and on the recipient's computer.\n\nPT: What shouldn't we delegate to our computer?\n\nMMC: People need to separate their personal lives from their professional lives. We've become a society where everything is commingled. You can easily use your G-mail account on your workplace computer,and email your baby sitter to pick up the kids from soccer \u00d1 or your girlfriend. That commingling gets people in trouble. That's the space we live in all day, that gray line that runs down the middle between business and personal.\n\nPT: What case has you stumped?\n\nMMC: There are cases that are unsolvable because there's a lack of electronic evidence.

{"text":"Honeypot\n\nSubmitted by Cyberwarz1 on Mon, 05\/17\/2010 - 10:10\n\nA honeypot is valuable as a surveillance and early-warning tool. While it is often a computer, a honeypot can take other forms, such as files or data records, or even unused IP address space. A honeypot that masquerades as an open proxy to monitor and record those using the system is a sugarcane. Honeypots should have no production value, and hence should not see any legitimate traffic or activity. Whatever they capture is therefore malicious or unauthorized. One practical implication of this is honeypots that thwart spam by masquerading as the type of systems abused by spammers. They categorize trapped material 100% accurately: it is all illicit.\n\nHoneypots can carry risks to a network, and must be handled with care. If they are not properly walled off, an attacker can use them to break into a system.\n\nVictim hosts are an active network counter-intrusion tool. These computers run special software, designed to appear to an intruder as being important and worth looking into. In reality, these programs are dummies, and their patterns are constructed specifically to foster interest in attackers. The software installed on, and run by, victim hosts is dual purpose. First, these dummy programs keep a network intruder occupied looking for valuable information where none exists, effectively convincing him or her to isolate themselves in what is truly an unimportant part of the network. This decoy strategy is designed to keep an intruder from getting bored and heading into truly security-critical systems. The second part of the victim host strategy is intelligence gathering. Once an intruder has broken into the victim host, the machine or a network administrator can examine the intrusion methods used by the intruder. This intelligence can be used to build specific countermeasures to intrusion techniques, making truly important systems on the network less vulnerable to intrusion.\n\nHoneypots can be classified based on their deployment and based on their level of involvement. Based on the deployment, honeypots may be classified as\n\nProduction Honeypots\n\nResearch Honeypots\n\nProduction honeypots are easy to use, capture only limited information, and are used primarily by companies or corporations; Production honeypots are placed inside the production network with other production servers by organization to improve their overall state of security. Normally, production honeypots are low-interaction honeypots, which are easier to deploy. They give less information about the attacks or attackers than research honeypots do. The purpose of a production honeypot is to help mitigate risk in an organization. The honeypot adds value to the security measures of an organization.\n\nResearch honeypots are run by a volunteer, non-profit research organization or an educational institution to gather information about the motives and tactics of the Blackhat community targeting different networks. These honeypots do not add direct value to a specific organization. Instead they are used to research the threats organizations face, and to learn how to better protect against those threats. This information is then used to protect against those threats. Research honeypots are complex to deploy and maintain, capture extensive information, and are used primarily by research, military, or government organizations."}
{"text":"HOMELAND SECURITY\n\nA Homeland Security & Cyber Terrorism Prevention Initiative\n\niP3141 is a national homeland security & cyber terrorism prevention initiative developed by New York State licensed psychologist and forensic consultant, Michael Nuccitelli, Psy.D. As part of iP3141, he has designed a template that will reduce the probability of a cyber-terrorist attack, increase homeland security information dissemination speed and ignite an Information Age educational movement. Provided is a brief overview of iP3141.\n\niP3141 is a national homeland security & cyber terrorism prevention initiative developed by New York State licensed psychologist and author of the Information Age iPredator construct, Michael Nuccitelli Psy.D. In light of growing reports America is at risk for a cyber terrorism attack and what authorities have termed Cyber Pearl Harbor, Dr. Nuccitelli has designed a plan that will reduce the probability of a cyber-terrorist attack, increase homeland security information dissemination speed and ignite an Information Age educational movement in the United States.\n\niP3141 is a national initiative to establish an educational, homeland security and iPredator professional and public sector network to service, educate & monitor Americans of the 3141 counties and county equivalents in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The National Conference of State Legislatures defines cyber terrorism as the use of Information and Communications Technology by terrorist groups and individuals to further their agenda. This can include use of ICT to organize and execute attacks against networks, computer systems and telecommunications infrastructures or for exchanging information or making threats electronically. Examples are hacking into computer systems, introducing viruses to vulnerable networks, web site defacing, denial-of-service attacks, or terrorist threats made via electronic communication.\n\nAccording to the FBI, cyber terrorism is any \"premeditated, politically motivated attack against information, computer systems, computer programs and data which results in violence against non-combatant targets by sub-national groups or clandestine agents.\" As the author of a new technological predator construct called iPredator, cyberstalkers, cyber terrorist, cyber criminals and the severely disturbed are just a few of the typologies included in his theory that victimize others using Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Also included is how Information Age society has drastically changed, becoming more isolated and disconnected leading to a paradigm shift in violence, crime and deviance. Dr. Nuccitelli's definition of iPred used to engage in criminal or deviant activities or to profile, identify, locate, stalk and engage a target.\n\nCyberstealth, a concept formulated along with iPredator, is a term used to define a method and\/or strategy by which iPredators use Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to establish and sustain complete anonymity while they troll and stalk a target. Given the Internet inherently affords everyone's anonymity, Cyberstealth used by iPredators range from negligible to highly complex and multi-faceted. The rationale for using \"stealth\" in the suffix of this term, serves to remind ICT users the primary intent fueling iPredators. This intent is to hide their identity by designing false online profiles, identities, covert tactics and methods to ensure their identities remain concealed reducing their probability of identification, apprehension and punishment.\n\nTherefore, as the Internet naturally offers all ICT users' anonymity if they decide, iPredators actively design online profiles and diversionary tactics to remain undetected and untraceable. Cyberstealth is a covert method by which iPredators are able to establish and sustain complete anonymity while they engage in ICT activities planning their next assault or researching the social profiles of their next target.\n\nFrom a nationalistic perspective, industrialized nations must now allocate increasing amounts of time, money, work force and strategic planning on cyber terrorism prevention. Needing to be addressed is the growing concerns of homeland security, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare all due to social media and the speed and magnitude of Information and Communications Technology. In addition to cyber threats to our national security, it is fair to assume iPredators and iPredator groups will become willing activists attempting to access and design larger and more deadly forms of cyber aggression.\n\nSocial science experts and educators have attempted to enlighten and warn the global community, but their impact to date pales in comparison to the wrath and inevitable growth of the threat of iPredator and the growing number of iPredator groups. iPredators rely on the multitude of benefits offered by ICT. These assistances include exchange of information over long distances, rapidity of information exchanged and the seemingly infinite access to data available. Malevolent in intent, iPredators rely on their capacity to deceive others in the abstract electronic universe known as cyberspace.\n\n(click image to visit website and listen live)\n\nIn September 2011, Dr. Nuccitelli founded iPredator Inc. to provide educational and advisory products & services to online users and organizations on cyber bullying, cyber stalking, online sexual predators, cyber terrorism, cybercrime, internet defamation, digital reputation and cyber psychology. Their goal is to reduce victimization, theft and disparagement from online assailants and increase awareness of the dangers lurking in cyberspace. In addition to assisting citizens, iPredator Inc.'s mission is to initiate a nationally sustained educational & awareness campaign and Dr. Nuccitelli's plan of what he has called the United States iP3141 National Network.\n\nOnce implemented, the mission of the iP3141 Network is to increase awareness of the benefits and dangers of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), decrease rates of cybercrime and human online victimization, educate citizens on homeland security and significantly increase education & awareness of pediatric online users via an ICT educational curriculum covering iPredator issues.\n\n(brief outline)\n\nThere are 3,141 counties and county equivalents in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. (United States Geological Survey) The letter \"i\" in iPredator stands for Information and Communications Technology. Cyber Terrorism is one typology of the construct iPredator. Hence, iP3141 is the tentative name of Dr. Nuccitelli's initiative. A brief description of Information and Communications Technology is as follows: Information and Communications Technology (ICT): Defined as \"the role of unified communications and the integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals), computers, middleware as well as necessary software, storage- and audio-visual systems, which enable users to create, access, store, transmit, and manipulate information. In other words, ICT consists of IT as well as telecommunication, broadcast media, all types of audio and video processing and transmission and network based control and monitoring functions.\" (Wikipedia)\n\nWithin each county, county equivalent and the United States, there would be the following:\n\n3 Appointed Professional Officials: The county district attorney, the chief and\/or appointed law enforcement official, and the superintendent of schools or an appointed superintendent representative.\n\n1 Elected Government Official: The county mayor or elected official that reports to the state elected governor.\n\n4 Appointed County Private Citizens: 1 private citizen representing county media, 1 private citizen representing all county educators, 1 private citizen representing county homeland security and 1 private citizen with expertise and\/or trained in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and a proposed United States Library of ICT (to be developed.)\n\n1 Federal iP3141 Network Website: 1 federally funded and managed central ICT website & social networking service for county appointed officials & citizens to obtain all ICT information related to homeland security, state and federal laws, educational curriculum and the United States Library of ICT (to be developed.)\n\nUnited States Library of ICT: The United States Library of ICT would be a central database of all past, present and future Information and Communications Technology (ICT) intelligence, news and trends available to all United States citizens and those seeking to prevent cyber terrorism and online victimization. The six areas of focus would be on Education, Law and Law Enforcement, Homeland Security, Social Sciences, ICT and ICT Research & Development.\n\nThe iP3141 plan is a work in progress and requires local, state and federal assistance. In 2013, iPredator Inc. is a small business and seeking proactive citizens and organizations of America to assist them in their endeavor to encourage a national discussion. In addition to the obvious benefits to Americans, Dr. Nuccitelli predicts it would help create new employment opportunities, expand homeland security awareness regarding cyber terrorism and cyber security threats, create a centralized forum for exchange of ICT, inspire educated consumerism for ecommerce & m-commerce and place the United States in the forefront globally in ICT & ICT safety.\n\nGiven that, the rapid expansion of ICT is both happening and inevitable, Dr. Nuccitelli would like to see 2013-2014 become the period the United States initiates steps to develop a resilient Cyber Ecosystem.\n\nNote to Reader: To anyone who reads this brief introduction to iP3141, feel free to contact iPredator Inc. with ideas and insights on how to encourage a national discussion and steps to establishing the iP3141 Network, a United States Library of ICT and encouraging members of Capital Hill to implement this network swiftly. As the iP3141 would be funded by local, state & federal agencies, the potential for creating employment opportunities would be tremendous.\n\nAs Dr. Nuccitelli continues to research these areas, he comes across numerous websites and services offering information & services relevant to ICT education, safety and protection. The goal is to create one centralized network that hosts all these forums, and most importantly, protect the welfare and future of American children. The mind & ICT will be relevant in understanding the motivations of all criminals, deviants and the severely disturbed. All future alleged mass killers and violent offenders would be assessed and judged by their criminal actions, their past and their ICT usage. Dr. Nuccitelli strongly believes ICT acts as an accelerant to the \"fantasy world\" and malevolent plans common to all cyber terrorist, mass murderers and those planning violence against humanity.\n\n\"Given it is estimated there is 2.23 billion active Internet users globally and quickly growing, it falls to reason to assume cyber predators and classic human predators will use ICT to plan, document and research their nefarious and malevolent activities.\"Michael Nuccitelli Psy.D., C.F.C.

{"text":"A Look at How Cybercrime Went Professional\n\nHacking, which was once the preserve of tech-savvy teenagers showing off, has turned into big business. By some estimates, organized crime represents up to 20 percent of the global GDP, and cybercrime is the fastest-growing part of it. And as the perpetrators become more and more experienced, the attacks become more precise.\n\nA huge increase in Internet crime is only part of the picture. The bigger worry for many organizations is that they are now being individually targeted by criminals using sophisticated technology.\n\nAs Russian and Georgian soldiers were flinging explosive artillery shells at each other, both sides in the South Ossetia conflict were also exploiting the very latest in cyber aggression, using techniques honed by professional gangsters specializing in online crime.\n\nAlthough the attacks are largely untraceable, both sides are pointing the finger firmly at each other. Russian reports claim that South Ossetian government sites were brought down by Georgian hackers. But Georgian institutions, including government departments and the National Bank, have also suffered a string of attacks. Georgia's foreign ministry is posting all news content to the Polish President's Web site after its own was taken out when President Mikheil Saakashvili's pages were replaced with pictures of Adolf Hitler. Meanwhile, reports also claim that Russia's RIA Novosti news agency site is being targeted and crashed. ... Go to source"}

{"text":"Big Brother Is Watching\n\nInfraGard: From Virtual Reality to Actual Reality\n\nMuch as the ECHELON program began in a different era, the InfraGard program had its inception in an intelligence world unlike the present. In those pre-9\/11 days, wide-scale terrorism at home did not seem possible\u2014the previous attacks on the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City federal building seemed like isolated incidents\u2014and our financial cyber infrastructure appeared to be the more likely venue of attack. However, after the deaths of almost 3,000 people, suddenly the likelihood of domestic terrorism seemed to increase, and InfraGard was meant to be one of the first lines of defense.\n\nThe private nonprofit group known as InfraGard was founded in 1996 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) field office in Cleveland, OH. Starting as a local effort to gain support from tech industries and academia to help combat cyber crime, it expanded to other FBI field offices and went nationwide in 1998. This self-described partnership between the private sector and the FBI is an information-sharing network that connects various state and local law-enforcement agencies, businesses, academic institutions and federal law-enforcement officials. After the attacks of September 11, InfraGard's purview was expanded beyond cyber attacks on American infrastructure to actual physical terrorist attacks, and oversight was transferred to the new Department of Homeland Security. The stated goal of the program is \"to promote ongoing dialogue and timely communication between members and the FBI. InfraGard members gain access to information that enables them to protect their assets and in turn give information to government that facilitates its responsibilities to prevent and address terrorism and other crimes.\"\n\nFBI field offices gather interested individuals to form local InfraGard chapters. Each chapter is governed by an executive board that meets with an FBI agent. Participants have access to a secure InfraGard website that \"provides members with information about recent intrusions, research related to critical infrastructure protection and the capability to communicate securely with other members.\"\n\nMatthew Rothschild, investigative reporter and editor of The Progressive, explains just who makes up the ranks of InfraGard: \"More than 350 of the top Fortune 500 companies are represented. It's agriculture, it's computers, it's energy, it's utilities, it's food industry, it's transportation, it's banking, it's everything.\" And what's more, it has grown exponentially in a very short period of time. \"In November 2001 there were just 1,700 members,\" says Rothschild. \"Now there are 32,000 members and there are chapters in every state.\"\n\nAnd this hidden group of informants is granted special rights and privileges not afforded the average citizen. An InfraGard whistleblower revealed to Rothschild that \"they get privileges, special phone numbers to call in times of emergency. They can get their family out maybe in times of an emergency or their friends, so they know about these threats. They're getting secret intelligence on almost a daily basis that the American public isn't getting, so they're in the know in a way that we aren't in the know.\""}
{"text":"on Internet security by Byron Acohido\n\nSomething the security community has been fretting about for a few years, seems to have finally arrived in earnest: cybercriminals are going mobile.\n\nNearly one in five mobile phone users have experienced some type of security threat with their device. That's the finding of a Cloudmark survey of 1,000 cellphone users, scheduled to be released Tuesday.\n\nPoisoned text messages, nearly non-existent in the U.S. a few years ago, grew 300% in 2010 and 400% in 2011, accounting for about 1% of all text messages. \"We've gone from totally clean to a trickle,\" says Rachel Kinoshito, head of Cloudmark's security operations. \"Most people are seeing about one a month.\"\n\nThat foothold is part of a broader concern. Variations of scams that infest the Internet, through PC browsers, have begun spreading on a meaningful scale through mobile devices. And it looks like the bad guys are just getting warmed up.\n\nOne type of poison text message involves tricking people into signing up for worthless services for which they get billed $9.99 a month. Another type lures them into doing a survey to win a free iPhone or gift card. Instead, the attacker gets them to divulge payment card or other info useful for identity-theft scams.\n\n\"Malicious attacks have exploded well beyond e-mail, and we are very aware of their move to mobile,\" says Jacinta Tobin, a board member of the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group, an industry group combating the problem.\n\nMeanwhile, hackers are repurposing skills honed in the PC world to attacks on specific mobile devices. Particularly, handsets using Google's Android operating system are frequently the target of hackers. In December, anti-virus company F-Secure tracked down 1,639 unique malicious Android apps \u2014 disguised as free apps and circulating on websites across the Internet. That's up from 48 in January 2011.\n\nOne type offered and delivered a free copy of the popular Angry Birds game. But the victim is also unwittingly signed up for a premium-rate texting service and charged an extra $10 a month on his or her phone bill, says F-Secure researcher Sean Sullivan.\n\nNetwork security company Juniper Networks says the pool of bad apps it has been tracking swelled 86% in February from January. Nearly half of the poisoned Android apps analyzed by Juniper were classic spyware, says Dan Hoffman, head of Juniper's mobile security business.\n\n\"We've identified malware that can steal credentials from e-mail and mobile banking applications,\" Hoffman says. \"These attacks can be devastating.\"\n\nThe online industry is on high alert. The working group\u2014 whose members include AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Facebook, PayPal and Time Warner\u2014 convened in San Francisco last month to join forces on defending new mobile threats.\n\n\"We need to stay ahead of what's happening with mobile abuse, social networking abuse and malware,\" says Tobin. \"It makes sense for us to collaborate across all these channelsComments\n\nGreat analysis, Byron.

Hackers have recognized this weakness and have been exploiting it.\n\nAccording to a 2009 Symantec Study, cyber crime has surpassed drug trafficking as the top money-making criminal activity in the world. If you haven't heard much about this crime spree, it's because 50% of the victims don't even know they've been attacked-- and the other 50% aren't exactly blogging about leaking account numbers.\n\nSo how do you protect your company? Here are some steps you should take:\n\n1. Use antivirus and make sure it is up to date. 2. Make sure you have your security patches installed. 3. Install a firewall. 4. Constantly monitor and audit your system. 5. Train your users.\n\nUser training is one of the most important and most over looked aspects of network security. In fact, 37% of all cyber crimes are user initiated. The user is tricked into inviting the criminal onto the network. From there he can harvest all the data needed to steal identities and access bank accounts. These attacks get more sophisticated every day. Now malicious emails can appear to come from a trusted source\u2014like your boss.\n\nTo fight these crimes, you need to take the necessary steps to protect your network. Treat them like what they are\u2014robberies. You wouldn't leave your life savings on your front lawn, so don't leave your account numbers unprotected either. Follow the steps above to reduce your risk of becoming a victim, and tell your friends, colleges, and acquaintances to do the same.\n\nIf you want to find out how safe your data is, Dynamic Edge is offering 7 free network audits to show you how vulnerable your business may be. During this audit, we will check each of the computers on your network to determine how secure they are. When we're done, we provide your company with a detailed report exposing weaknesses, and an action plan to address the problems. This is our gift to the small business community, and it comes with no obligation for any paid service.\n\nWe need to get proactive if we are going to prevent these robberies folks. If you're re-acting, you're already too late."}

{"text":"Blocking a cyberterror attack\n\nIn the abstract, fighting a war is simple. The enemy and the targets are generally identifiable. But in the war against hackers and virus writers, the combatants are harder to know.\n\nThe attacker might be a 14-year-old in Canada, or a co-worker in the accounting department. \"You'll have every type of person\" practicing the dark arts of programming, said Sarah Gordon, a senior research fellow with the security technology developer Symantec.\n\nAs industry and government seek to repel the attacks for which the Internet is a launching pad, much of the effort involves understanding those who unleash malicious code and jiggle digital doorknobs. In the world that emerged after the Sept. 11 attacks, after all, understanding an elusive enemy has become a growing part of confronting a threat.\n\nSecurity experts have warned for several years that cyberterrorism presents a great potential threat to the United States, with its increasing dependence on computer networks for everything from weapons systems to hydroelectric dams, not to mention the underpinnings of commerce.

{"text":"The first problem is the \"80%.\" 80% of what? What is the sample set? Are the victims in the retail and hospitality sectors or the telecommunications and aerospace industries? Speaking in general terms, different sorts of organizations are at different levels of maturity, capability, and resourcefulness when it comes to digital security.\n\nIn the spirit of salvaging this poorly worded statistic, let's assume (rightly or wrongly) that the sample set involves the retail and hospitality sectors.\n\nThe second problem is the term \"breach.\" What is a breach? Is it the compromise of a single computer? (What's compromise? Does it mean executing malicious code, or login via stolen credentials, or...?) What is the duration of the incident? There are dozens of questions that could be asked here.\n\nTo salvage this part, let's assume \"breach\" means \"an incident involving execution of unauthorized code by an unauthorized intruder\" on a single computer.\n\nThe third problem is the word \"preventable.\" \"Prevention\" as a concept is becoming less useful by the second. Think about how an intruder might try to execute malicious code against a victim. Imagine a fully automated attack that happens when a victim visits a malicious Web site. An exploit kit could throw a dozen or more exploits against a browser and applications until one works. Are they all non-zero day, or are some zero day? Again, many questions beckon.\n\nTo salvage the end of the original statement, let's translate \"preventable\" into \"exploitation of a vulnerability for which a patch had been publicly available for at least seven days.\"\n\nOur new statement now reads something like \"In the retail and hospitality sectors, 80% of the incidents where an unauthorized intruder successfully executed unauthorized code on a single computer exploited a vulnerability for which a patch had been publicly available for at least seven days.\"\n\nIsn't that catchy! That's why we heard shortcuts like the original statement, which are basically worthless. Unfortunately, they end up driving listeners into poor conceptual and operational models.\n\nThe wordy but accurate statement says nothing about preventability, which is key. The reason is that a determined adversary, when confronted by a fully patched target, may decide to escalate to using a zero-day or other technique for which patches are irrelevant.\n\n4 comments:\n\nGreat post! In a lot of ways, Twitter (and other abbreviated communications mediums, to include the option for simply clicking \"Like\" or \"+1\") have really done a lot to decimate the already poor communications skills of many.\n\nOne thing I keep in mind when I hear folks quoting any of the annual reports is that each of the organizations providing those reports has a different customer base, different focus, etc. Readers have to keep in mind which statistics are based on a minimalist approach to response, and which may be based on a more in-depth approach to intelligence gathering.\n\nFinally, what is \"preventable\"? I've worked engagements where a patch would've \"prevented\" the incident that we uncovered, although we have no idea if the attacker would've walked away if the attempt had failed, or if they would have tried something else.\n\nIn trying to encapsulate something like the final statement in your post into 140 characters for easier transmission, or to be \"the first\" to get it out, we're not distilling the issue down to it's essential components, as much as we're just throwing away accuracy.\n\nI love this line of thought you've brought up. The soundbytes, catch phrases, tweets, headlines, buzzwords, and all things taken without the proper context are slowing and in some cases reversing progress in Def Sec.\n\nIf you look at a breach in hindsight and assume that the actual attack would not continue or escalate if the circumstances changed (i.e. if what was successful, was not), then I would bet that closer to 100% of breaches are \"preventable\". What is missing from this quote is \"prevented...using basic security controls\". That context really changes the point of the statistic."}

This DDoS master is used to identify and communicate with other computer systems that are compromised in a second step. The hacker loads cracking tools on multiple computers before starting the attack against the target system. Finally, with a single command, the hacker launches the ultimate attack by activating the cracking tools on the multiple compromised computers flooding the targeted system with information that causes the DoS. The DDoS attacks inflict serious damage to the target systems but also may cause collateral damage to associated nodes.\n\nMultiple hacker groups such as \"Anonymous\" are known for targeting business websites such as Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Amazon, Bank of America or PostFinance Bank and governmental agencies promoting their political views in several conflicts around the world.\nMost targeted systems of DDoS attacks, however, are online financial markets, ecommerce (stores, auctions, sale message boards etc.) with 25% of all registered attacks followed by trading sites with 20% and gaming sites and banks with 15% each in 2011.\nThe number of DDoS attacks was growing by 57% in the second half of 2011 associated with an increase of DDoS botnets around the world.

{"text":"Threat inflation, according to Thrall and Cramer, is a concept in political science that refers to \"the attempt by elites to create concern for a threat that goes beyond the scope and urgency that a disinterested analysis would justify.\" Different actors\u2014including members of Congress, defense contractors, journalists, policy experts, academics, and civilian, military, and intelligence officials\u2014will each have their own motives for contributing to threat inflation. When a threat is inflated, the marketplace of ideas on which a democracy relies to make sound judgments\u2014in particular, the media and popular debate\u2014can become overwhelmed by fallacious information. The result can be unwarranted public support for misguided policies.\n\nThe run-up to the Iraq War illustrates the dynamic of threat inflation. After 9\/11, the Bush Administration decided to invade Iraq to oust Saddam Hussein. Lacking any clear casus belli, the administration sought popular and congressional support for war by promoting several rationales that ultimately proved baseless.\n\nOver the past two years, there has been a drive for increased federal involvement in cybersecurity. This drive is evidenced by the introduction of several comprehensive cybersecurity bills in Congress, the initiation of several regulatory proceedings related to cybersecurity by the Federal Communications Commission and Commerce Department, and increased coverage of the issue in the media. The official consensus seems to be that the United States is facing a grave and immediate threat that only quick federal intervention can address. This narrative has gone largely unchallenged by members of Congress or the press, and it has inflated the threat.\n\nThere is very little verifiable evidence to substantiate the threats claimed, and the most vocal proponents of a threat engage in rhetoric that can only be characterized as alarmist.

{"text":"You are here\n\nGee is for Geek.\n\nSubmitted by Gee on Fri, 02\/03\/2012 - 02:18\n\nHola, I'm Gareth, also known as Gee. I reside in Wellington. I'm a security enthusiast looking to get a start in security.\n\nI've been interested in computer \"security\" from a very young age starting with my mother password protecting the family computer and making comments like; \"Well, if you can get past that, sure, you can play Commander Keen.\" A control break before the boot loader menu followed by starting windows form the MS-DoS prompt fixed that. The new password on BIOS a few days later was her partners name \u2026.was she smarter than a 7 year old? I think not. Ever since then I've adopted the number 8 wire approach to computers and often hack around a problem which could indeed have a reasonable fix.\n\nIn my humble opinion computer security, especially penetration testing, is the epitome of IT. Which is one of the reasons I want to get into IT security. Another is because I want to help protect and educate companies and people from having their shit owned. From my experiences a lot of people in IT, sadly including some System Administrators, believe that virus scanners and firewalls are all the protection they need and this is simply not the case (I was gonna list some examples but there is just too many to choose from). In fact it is that mindset that leads you to being owned. Another great mindset is why would \"hackers\" want to target \"us\"? It's often not that hackers want to target a specific company it is that they know a vulnerability and search for anyone they can find that is susceptible. Also, it's one of the few areas of IT with creative aspects. To be a penetration tester you have to be constantly thinking outside the box and being creative - well apart from all the red-tape, scoping, paperwork and meeting with clients.\n\nSecurity very much feels like an old boys club. It's very hard to get information on exactly what you need to learn. It's very hard to get a start. It's very hard to breach the barrier between book learning, as such, and, well, to become a penetration tester you have to (as a potential employer of mine once said) \"you sorta need to be hacking in the real world\" to learn the skills you need. If you don't want to be out there - its more ok when you are a teenager, when you can't be tried as an adult - risking your livelihood on pwning some stuff but once you are an adult the stakes are much higher and you can't afford to get caught. Getting caught and having a record doesn't actually help you get into security, it hinders you.\n\nWhile actually reading books on penetration testing gives you a lot of the fundamentals they don't actually teach you what you need to know. Often the information is quite outdated, which isn't necessarily all bad because the theory behind the exploit or how to discover the exploit is useful. But it will only carry you so far along your journey. The podcasts, if you are listening to recent ones, get around the information being out of date but I've found them to not necessarily be helpful - they are more like a bunch of security people keeping you up on news and events and having some lulz. They aren't actually teaching what you need to know to get into the security field. There are a lot of good resources from Foundstone and other projects such as WebGoat to learn web application penetration testing; they have vulnerable web applications, especially the hackme series eg. hackme bank, hackme shipping etc. Another thing that I've done to understand, learn and find peers and interest groups is to attend Kiwicon - NZ's own hacker conference. With a motto like 'share the knowledge' they do a good job of it. It definitely rekindles my passion for security each year and has aided greatly in social networking for finding likeminded people.\n\nThis year I'd like a start in security. I hope that working with in2security throughout this year will help me reach that goal. You can follow my progress through my blog posts.\n\nIn (some) answer to your \"Security very much feels like an old boys club. It's very hard to get information on exactly what you need to learn.\"\n\nSo very true! My advice (as an 'honorary member' of that 'old boys club'?) ... persevere!\n\nAnd if'n you want info on exactly what you should be learning? Approach one of those uber-hacker geeky dudes from either company under that 'Sponsored By' banner. Send an email ... make an appointment ... go and see 'em! Hell ... mention 'in2security'. You'll find they're actually pretty approachable (the lesser anti-social ones anyway) - and both have offices in Wellington.\n\nJust don't feed them after mindight, okay?\n\nWhatver happens? Always remember that they (gasp!) were once just starting out, too. Remind 'em of that!"}

Basit and Amjad; they are still there. (Laughter) (Applause) So here standing up is Basit. Sitting down is his brother Amjad. These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus. Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion. I asked them why. I asked them how they feel about what they started. And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years. So there is some sort of justice in the world after all.\n\nNow, the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more. So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like. What I'm writing here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer. So let me just mount some drives. Go over there. What we have here is a list of old viruses. So let me just run some viruses on my computer.\n\nFor example, let's go with the Centipede virus first. And you can see at the top of the screen, there's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one. You know that you're infected, because it actually shows up. Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash invented in Russia in 1992. Let me show you one which actually makes some sound. (Siren noise) And the last example, guess what the Walker virus does. Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected. So it used to be fairly easy to know that you're infected by a virus, when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers.\n\nToday, they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers. Today, viruses are a global problem. What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs, where we track virus infections worldwide. So we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere. In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web, we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses, how many new examples of malware we find every single day. Here's the latest virus we've found in a file called Server.exe. And we found it right over here three seconds ago - the previous one, six seconds ago. And if we just scroll around, it's just massive. We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands. And that's the last 20 minutes of malware every single day.\n\nSo where are all these coming from then? Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses. It's gangs like - let's go to GangstaBucks.com. This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers. So if you are a virus writer and you're capable of infecting Windows computers, but you don't know what to do with them, you can sell those infected computers - somebody else's computers - to these guys. And they'll actually pay you money for those computers. So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers? Well there's multiple different ways, such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking, or key loggers. Key loggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view, and they record everything you type. So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches. Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals. Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals. Same thing with every single password and so on.\n\nBut the thing that they're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store. Because when you do purchases in online stores, you will be typing in your name, the delivery address, your credit card number and the credit card security codes. And here's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago. That's the credit card number, that's the expiration date, that's the security code, and that's the name of the owner of the card. Once you gain access to other people's credit card information, you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information. And that, obviously, is a problem. We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime.\n\nOne example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations. We go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons. We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden, and his partner in crime, also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages, Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain, a U.S. citizen. These guys were running an operation called I.M.U., a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions. They are both right now on the run. Nobody knows where they are. U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago, froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.\n\nSo the amount of money online crime generates is significant. And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks. We know that online criminals are hiring programmers, hiring testing people, testing their code, having back-end systems with SQL databases. And they can afford to watch how we work - like how security people work - and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build. They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage. I mean, the Internet is international. That's why we call it the Internet.\n\nAnd if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world, here's a video built by Clarified Networks, which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world. This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia, moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is trying to shut down. So you just can't shut these guys down. They will switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another - moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this. So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world. The criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us.\n\nSo how do you actually go around finding online criminals? How do you actually track them down. Let me give you an example. What we have here is one exploit file. Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file, which contains an exploit. And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer, it actually takes over your computer and runs code.\n\nNow, if you'll take a look at this image file - well there's the image header, and there the actual code of the attack starts. And that code has been encrypted, so let's decrypt it. It has been encrypted with XOR function 97. You just have to believe me, it is, it is. And we can go here and actually start decrypting it. Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted. And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original. But just keep staring at it. You'll actually see that down here you can see a Web address: Unionc.com\/d\/ioo.exe. And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program. And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.\n\nBut even more interestingly, if we continue decrypting, we'll find this mysterious string which says O600KO78RUS. That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature. It's not used for anything. And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means. So obviously I Googled for it. I got zero hits; wasn't there. So I spoke with the guys at the lab. And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs, and one of them mentioned, well, it ends in rus like Russia. And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg. For example, you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that. So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg. And through a long road, we eventually found this one particular website.\n\nHere's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website, and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal. And on this blog, he blogs about his life, about his life in St. Petersburg - he's in his early 20s - about his cat, about his girlfriend. And he drives a very nice car. In fact, this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower. Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.\n\nHow do I know about this car? Because he blogged about the car. He actually had a car accident. In downtown St. Petersburg, he actually crashed his car into another car. And he put blogged images about the car accident - that's his Mercedes - right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into. And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS. And if you actually take a look at the scene picture, you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS. Now I'm not a lawyer, but if I would be, this is where I would say, \"I rest my case.\"\n\n(Laughter)\n\nSo what happens when online criminals are caught? Well in most cases it never gets this far. The vast majority of the online crime cases, we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from. And even if we are able to find online criminals, quite often there is no outcome. The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence, or for some reason we can't take them down. I wish it would be easier; unfortunately it isn't.\n\nBut things are also changing at a very rapid pace. You've all heard about things like Stuxnet. So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these. That's a Siemens S7 400plc, programmable logic computer. And this is what runs our infrastructure. This is what runs everything around us. PLC's, these small boxes which have no display, no keyboard, which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job. For example, the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these. And when Stuxnet infects one of these, that's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about. Because everything around us is being run by these. I mean, we have critical infrastructure. You go to any factory, any power plant, any chemical plant, any food processing plant, you look around - everything is being run by computers.\n\nEverything is being run by computers. Everything is reliant on these computers working. We have become very reliant on Internet, on basic things like electricity, obviously, on computers working. And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us. We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail.\n\n(Laughter)\n\n(Applause)\n\nSo preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren't there. It's actually very basic stuff - thinking about continuity, thinking about backups, thinking about the things that actually matter.\n\nNow I told you - (Laughter) I love the Internet. I do. Think about all the services we have online. Think about if they are taken away from you, if one day you don't actually have them for some reason or another. I see beauty in the future of the Internet, but I'm worried that we might not see that. I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime. Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nI've spent my life defending the net. And I do feel that if we don't fight online crime, we are running a risk of losing it all. We have to do this globally, and we have to do it right now. What we need is more global, international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs - these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks. That's much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls. What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks. And even more importantly, we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime, but haven't yet done it. We have to find the people with the skills, but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good."}

{"text":"October is Cyber Security Awareness Month and Information Services is sponsoring several activities and events to help everyone in the DePauw community understand cyber security issues and how to protect themselves.\n\nHighlights include:\n\nOct. 5 \u2013 Oct. 31\n\nHelp The CyberCats catch the cyber-villains\n\nThe CyberCats need your help in catching four cyber villains around campus. Look for web links on posters and in tech-notice email explaining how you can win!\n\nOct. 7 \u2013 Oct. 24\n\nCyber Security Awareness Week Video Contest\n\nOct. 11 \u2013 Oct. 29\n\nProve you have Symantec Anti-Virus or Malwarebytes installed on your computer and up-to-date.\n\nBring your computer to the Helpdesk or the Digital Media Lab and prove you have either Symantec anti-virus or Malwarebytes installed and up-to-date for a chance to win an iTunes or Amazon gift card.\n\nOctober is National Cyber Security Awareness month. In past years, DePauw University chose to spend the last week in October to educate students and faculty about cyber security. This year, the Student Technology Support team at DePauw decided to start the fun a little earlier and offered many opportunities and activities to raise awareness of the issues throughout the month. Cyber Security Awareness Month is a great opportunity to educate students, faculty and staff on many topics related to cyber security, including virus scanning, protection of digital data, prevention of stolen identities through the internet, and education about simple computer maintenance. The increase in awareness and education of these issues is not only of great benefit to individuals; it also helps create a safer technological environment for everyone on campus.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the end of the semester, midterms, papers, projects and deadlines can all stand in the way of a well-deserved rest. In the process of sifting through notes and research material, you are likely using your computer \u2013 and often for great lengths of time. If you find yourself glued to your laptop, you may be increasing your chances of suffering from information overload, which can cause stress, confusion and mental exhaustion.\n\nFortunately, there are some quick ways to prevent information overload and simplify your life.\n\nFirst, learn to plan ahead and prioritize. To truly break away from your computer, a personal agenda or planner can help keep your life in order. If you do find that you prefer to keep everything digitally organized, online planners can also be very helpful. If you're not already using your GroupWise Calendar to keep yourself organized, I suggest picking it up. Not only is it helpful for planning, but most faculty and staff use it to keep track of their days \u2013 making finding a time to meet as simple as opening up their calendar.\n\nSecond, do your best to eliminate distractions. The easiest way to stay focused on the task at hand is to disconnect from the Internet. If, however, you require the Internet for your work, all is not lost. For Firefox users, if you keep distracting tabs in your internet browser, delete them to avoid the temptation to surf the net.\n\nAnother easy way to free your mind and your computer of clutter is to organize your files. Back up any files you need to save but do not need to use, onto an external hard drive or jump disk. Do your best to minimize the number of files you view on a daily basis by storing them in folders organized by year, course or project. When naming files, use meaningful names or abbreviations that can easily be recognized later to avoid sifting through documents.\n\nPurging your computer and e-mail inbox of unnecessary files is another simple way to destress. Delete and clean out any unnecessary files you may be saving on your computer, and empty your recycle bin frequently. If you find your inbox overflowing, sort through your e-mails and discard what you can. If you're keeping attachments in your inbox, save them onto your computer. Organize your e-mail account much like your computer by creating folders and filing messages to keep track of your email by topic.\n\nWhile I can't guarantee the next few weeks will be devoid of stress, I can assure you that keeping your computer free of clutter will keep you more organized and less stressed than you would be otherwise.\n\nWith everyone returning to campus, the hustle and bustle of DePauw is once again at full swing. Everyone is on the go and most likely glued to their computers. This means there are more chances they could be adding unnecessary physical stress to an already hectic life. Here are some suggestions that can help you lessen the strain on all areas of the body.\n\nEyes. Position your monitor or laptop screen to avoid glare or reflections from overhead lighting, outside sources of light or even reflections off your own clothing. Consider turning off some overhead lights. Keep your display screen clean and set the contrast and brightness to levels that allow you to see it clearly.\n\nArms. Keep your forearms, wrists and hands in a relaxed, neutral position. Keep your elbows close to your body as you type. Try an adjustable chair to help with height of the work surface. Though it's not always possible, using an external mouse and keyboard will allow your arms to sit comfortably.\n\nNeck.Do your best to avoid straining your neck. Angle the screen so that it may be viewed without having to bend or rotate the neck. Maintain a comfortable viewing distance from the screen. Ideally, try to be 20 to 30 inches away from the screen. If you are using a desktop computer or external monitor with your laptop, adjust your chair or the monitor so the screen is at or slightly below eye level.\n\nBack. Use a chair that provides good lower back support. Use a pillow, rolled-up towel or other soft object against the back of your chair to assist in the support of the lower back. Not only will sitting up straight keep your posture in check, but it can also help keep you awake.\n\nLegs. As tempting as it is to curl up in a chair and work, it's much healthier to keep your thighs parallel to the floor. Make this easier, by putting your feet flat on the floor or on a footrest. It's also important to get up and and move around periodically. A short walk around or stretch can help keep you awake and comfortable.\n\nThere are also other ways to reduce the amount of strain put on your body during a typical work week. If carrying your laptop across campus, try to minimize the weight. Do not carry extra peripheral devices; think about how you intend to use the laptop before you leave and then only carry the necessary items. And, if you take your laptop around often, consider investing in a backpack rather than a large purse or briefcase, to put an equal amount of weight on both shoulders. Being aware of your physical comfort and safety will help keep you healthier, happier and more productive.\n\nLast fall Gary Barcus, Director of Development Services, sent an email to his department to help his staff deal with a problem many of us have run into at some point or another \u2014 a computer becomes infected by a virus or spyware. His explanation of the problem and his instructions for dealing with the problem were so helpful, we asked Gary for permission to publish it in our newsletter. It follows below:\n\nOne of our computers may be infected with a malicious program. Heavier than normal network traffic from our area may point to an infected machine. To safeguard against this infection, we all need to check our Symantec virus scanning and run a spyware detection program on our individual work stations.The IT Help Desk website:\n\n\n\nhas links to these services. Each of us should make sure we have Symantec installed and, just as important, configured to receive automatic updates and to run regularly. Please go to the link shown if you do not have Symantec installed. It can be downloaded from a link on that site. You should call the help desk if you have any problems with the installation.\n\nOnce it is installed, you should configure Symantec to run automatic virus definition updates and perform a daily scan of your system. Click on the Start button, then All Programs, then Symantec Client Security, then Symantec Antivirus to start the program. OR, click on the Shield on the notification area of the Task Bar in Windows. This is the area to the right of the Task Bar that contains the time and date. The attached word document shows how to configure Symantec after you've opened it.Also available on the IT Help Desk site are Spyware detection programs. These find and disable spyware that is loaded on your computer as you browse the internet. This spyware reports your activity to other sites that you visit. In this way, it attempts to exert some level of control over your browser. Wikipedia defines spyware as follows::\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that sites like WeatherBug, Coupon Sites, Grokster, and Kazaa often offer free download programs that come with hidden spyware embedded. If you visit a site and download a \"free\" utility, you may have infected your machine. Run Ad-Aware or Spybot-Search & Destroy on a regular basis to clean this from your system. Better yet, don't download random software from sites you visit! You should call the help desk if you have serious problems or if you think your machine might be infected.\n\nLast week, Oct 29 \u2013 Nov. 2, was Cybersecurity Awareness Week. Although the week has passed, the importance of the message remains. Healthy computing is an important aspect of keeping your laptop in working order during your four years at DePauw. There are five simple ways to make sure that your computer stays safe at all levels.\n\nPrevent Theft. A simple glance at the blotter can tell you that laptop theft is a problem on DePauw's campus. When on the move, keep your belongings in sight and never leave your laptop unattended. If you can, lock up your computer with a cable lock when you are not using it and do not leave it in your car. If you must keep it in your car, lock it in the trunk or keep it hidden. Laptop theft can occur anywhere on campus, and you chances of recovering your computer are slim. You can increase the chance of recovery by writing down your computers model and serial number and keep it in a safe place.\n\nProtect your identity by keeping your personal information safe. With social networking sites as a prominent part of our lives, the possibility of someone acquiring personal information is high. Be careful of what you post on Facebook, MySpace or social networking sites. Reduce the risk of utilizing social networking sites by not posting a physical address, being careful of what pictures you post, and restricting your information to just your friends. A good way to find out if you're comfortable with the information the world can see about you is to Google your name.\n\nChange your password regularly. It may seem like a hassle, but by changing your password often you can prevent people from guessing your password and stealing or using valuable information. Make your passwords unobvious and hard to guess. Be sure to use both letters and numbers. Avoid sharing your password with your friends. Though you trust them, there should always only be one person who has access to your information.\n\nBack up your data frequently to a network drive, CD or DVD. After having my computer crash last year, backing up information has become a habit. To make this task less time consuming, use a backup strategy that fits your lifestyle. If you write a lot of papers or generate a lot of data every day, consider backing up daily using backup software such as Norton Ghost. If you do not generate a lot of new data every day, consider backing up your files manually on a weekly or monthly schedule.\n\nInstall antivirus software and keep it up to date.DePauw offers Symantec Antivirus for all faculty, staff and students and it can be downloaded from the helpdesk page at  Be sure you update it frequently and scan often. Don't wait for a problem to occur before you install or update your antivirus software, as it could be too late. Also, refrain from downloading illegal movies, music or software. Not only is this breaking copyright laws, but these files may contain viruses.\n\nIf you take each of these steps, you will find that not only will your computer run more efficiently, but you will have peace of mind knowing that your data and your identity is more secure. For more tips on how you can prevent data loss, theft, or identity theft go to \n\nBacking up your data is the best way to protect yourself against viruses, accidental deletions and overwrites, and other scary computer troubles. The minutes you spend in backing up your files once a day or once a week can save you from hours of frustrating labor reconstructing lost databases, expense records, papers, and research notes.\n\nBacking up is Easy to Do!\n\nDon't avoid backing up your data regularly because of the mistaken idea that backups are difficult. Some surprising truths about backups include:\n\n\u2022 It's as easy as saving or copying files to a folder. If you don't know how to save a file to a folder, ask!\n\n\u2022 It's fast. Backups do not take hours to do since you only copy the unique data you've created.\n\n\u2022 You don't need special software to do it. All you need is an external drive or storage device (see the list below.)\n\nWhat Files to Back Up\n\nYou should back up any data that you do not wish to lose, or is critical to your job or class. You do not need to back up program files, as they can be re-installed from original CD's. A few examples of types of files to back up:\n\n\u2022 Reports, term papers, letters, or other important documents\n\n\u2022 Excel spreadsheets\n\n\u2022 Databases, such as Access or FileMaker\n\n\u2022 PowerPoint presentation files\n\n\u2022 Pictures\n\n\u2022 Music files\n\nTo make backing up your data easier, you may want to organize your files into one or more discreet folders.\n\nBackup Drives or Devices\n\nThe best way to keep your personal data safe is to keep a backup copy of your files in another location. If the document is really important, you may want more than one backup!\n\nImportant note: if you are in a DePauw Computer Lab, remember, once you restart a lab system, EVERYTHING IS ERASED! Always save your working copy somewhere else.\n\nBelow is a list of some locations for you to back up your critical data:\n\n password"}

{"text":"Hacking made easy by design\n\nThe hacking of phones by journalists, private detectives and others is a deplorable invasion of privacy, and cannot be condoned.\n\nBut what interests me as a computer scientist and designer of these new sorts of technologies is how and why these things happen, and whether it's easy to stop.\n\nWhat is revealing in the recent cases is that it's not really been hacking. That suggests that someone has spent ages actively trying to break through levels of security to get to the messages - as if they had to scale a high fence, crawl across open ground swept by floodlights, pick a lock, open a creaky door next to a salivating but sleeping guard dog, then creep across a floor and work, sweat dripping from brow, to open a combination safe by pressing a stethoscope to the side, and then escaping with the contents.\n\nWhereas, in fact, it was more like wandering along a street and seeing who had left their door open and wandering in, taking what they found in there. Not legal, and reprehensible, but not quite the criminal mastermind that 'hacking' suggests.\n\nTo hack the phone, the hacker rings the phone which goes to voicemail - they then try some common combinations of numbers as the default password, which most people have not changed: 1111 - 1234 - 9999 - 4321 - 0000 - and one of those gave them access.\n\nThis is not a difficult thing to do. There are a number of interesting things here. One is that the people who had voicemail never gave it a moment's thought - they assumed it would be secure, probably because they hadn't a clue how it works and just assumed it ought to be so it would be. And why should they have to understand the technology?\n\nBut a few seconds thought, realising that they, like everyone else, had been issued with a default access code, and they would realise that changing it would be quite sensible as there is nothing to stop anyone else calling in an using that code.\n\nIndeed, the network providers encourage us to change the codes. But we don't bother. Does that make us negligent, or at least mildly responsible if we are then hacked?\n\nIt also brings into question why it is there as a feature in the first place. Theoretically, it's there to allow you to access your voicemail from another phone.\n\nHow many people do you know who do that? It's a carryover from the days of huge clunky non-portable brick-like mobiles, when carrying your mobile was a pain, and it's battery would have expired anyway, so you needed a way to see who had rung you.\n\nBut now, we access voicemail from our own mobiles, when we want to.\n\nIt would have been better not to allow remote access, except on special request and with clearer warnings for the few who needed it, in order to keep the majority of the population safe. So we could have designed a better solution - if we had given it some thought.\n\nThis sort of thing still goes on. Many people have wireless networks at home, and lots of these are taken from the box, plugged in, and turned on.\n\nBecause they then seem to work, people leave them alone - and they are running in a very unsafe default mode, broadcasting their presence to the world, with weak or no password protection, allowing anyone passing to access your network - and from your network, often your computer.\n\nAnd even if not your computer, you could be getting a visit from the copyright police or lawyers, asking you why you are download so much copyright material - or illegal pornography or bomb-making instructions, or anything else - and you might not have been but might have been allowing others to do so - and you'll have a level of responsibility for that.\n\nAgain, the manufacturers don't make it simple or easy for people, and rarely set things up to work in a safe way straight from the box.\n\nThere have been many lessons from the phone hacking scandal.\n\nOne clear one has been that the public detest it, and it shouldn't have been done.\n\nAnother one is that we have to look to our own practices, to see if we accidentally aide and abet those wanting to misuse technology.\n\nAnother one is that we need to demand more from our designers and manufacturers, to set these things up properly for us in the first place.\n\nAnd a final one is that we owe it to ourselves, those we care for, and society in general, to become a little more technologically literate so that we can understand the ramifications of the wonderfully powerful technology we have everyday access to"}
{"text":"Internet in India is growing rapidly. It has given rise to new opportunities in most field we are able to think about, be it entertainment, business, sports or education. Internet boasts its own disadvantages. One of the major disadvantages is Cybercrime \u2013 illegal activity committed on the internet. The world wide web, together with its advantages, in addition has exposed citizens to security risks that come with connecting to some large network. Computers today are being misused for illegal pursuits like e-mail espionage, credit card fraud, spam's, software piracy and so forth; criminal activities in the cyberspace are on an upswing. Because the cases of cybercrime grow, there is a growing need to prevent them.\n\nLegislation\n\nIt Act (IT Act) 2000\n\nThe federal government of India introduced the info Technology Act, on 17th October 2000. It Act (IT Act) 2000, could be the India's only cyber law. The IT Act is aimed to offer legal recognition for transactions completed by means of electronic data interchange and other means of electronic communication, known as \"electronic commerce\".\n\nIndia has done an excellent job by enacting a cyber law. Oahu is the 12th country around the globe using a cyber law. It covers areas like e-governance, e-commerce, cyber contraventions and cyber offences.\n\nInformation Technology ACT 2000 Effects in Combating Cyber Crime\n\nIn accordance with Section 75 with the Act, the Act applies to any offence or contravention committed outside India by anybody no matter his nationality, if such act involves a computer, computer system or network in India. The IT Act prescribes provisions for contraventions in Chapter IX with the Act, particularly Section 43 from the Act, which covers unauthorized access, downloading, introduction of virus, denial of access and internet time theft committed by anybody. It prescribes punishment through damages not exceeding Rs. 1 crore for the affected party. Chapter XI from the IT Act discusses the cyber crimes and offences interalia, tampering with computer source documents (Sec. 65), Hacking (Sec.66), publishing of obscene information (Sec.67), unauthorized use of protected system (Sec.70), breach of confidentiality (Sec.72), publishing false digital signature certificate (Sec.73).\n\nThe implications of IT Act 2000 provisions for the e-businesses is that their email would certainly be a legitimate and legal form of communication in India that may be duly produced and approved in a court of law. Companies shall easily be able to accomplish electronic commerce using the legal infrastructure supplied by the Act. Digital signatures are already given legal validity and sanction in the Act. The IT Act also addresses giving her a very issues of security, that happen to be so important to the achievements of electronic transactions.\n\nOne of the first cases when the accused was convicted beneath the IT Act provisions was the case of State of Tamilnadu V. Suhas Kutty. The case associated with posting of obscene, defamatory and annoying message in regards to a divorcee woman within the yahoo message group. E-Mails were also given to the victim for information through the accused via a false e-mail account opened by him within the name in the victim. The posting in the message led to annoying telephone calls for the lady inside belief that she was soliciting. The accused is discovered accountable for offences under section 469, 509 IPC and 67 of IT Act 2000 and the accused was convicted and was sentenced for that offence to have RI for 2 years under 469 IPC and also to pay fine of Rs.500\/-and to the offence under Section 509 IPC sentenced to endure One year Simple imprisonment and to pay fine of Rs.500\/- as well as the offence under Section 67 of computer Act 2000 to have RI for two main many to cover fine of Rs.4000\/-.\n\nEight years have passed considering that the act was enacted plus these eight year's technology has changed in a considerably faster pace. Though law cannot come to be supposed to keep pace with alterations in technology, there to stay are few areas in the present cyber laws which take some attention.\n\nSome Important Shortcomings in the Information Technology Act, 2000\n\nPornography\n\nThe phrase 'pornography' when used in relation to an offence is not defined in a statutes in India. But Section 67 from the IT Act lays down regulations that obscenity is surely an offence when it is published or transmitted or caused to get published in any electronic form. The expressions, 'publishing' or 'transmission' weren't specifically defined underneath the IT Act.\n\nEven punishment for pornography is just not sufficient in India as well as in the proposed amendment inside it Act the imprisonment will be reduced to two years in the present five year imprisonment. Though legislations worldwide contain severe provisions for child pornography there isn't any reference to child pornography inside Indian Act. It is interesting to notice down that the I . t . Act prohibits publishing of pornography but viewing of pornography is not an offence beneath the act.\n\nData Protection in Internet Banking\n\nThe info Technology Act discusses unauthorized access however it doesn't mention maintaining integrity of customer transactions. The act doesn't lay out any duty upon banks to shield information of consumers and clients. U.K features a data protection law which has been enacted Ten years back which is in 1998 this agreement banks or anyone holding sensitive information might be held answerable for damages when it fails to maintain adequate security protection according of information.\n\nSpamming\n\nRecently government entities of India revealed that around 76 % of e-mails originating from India are spam's, even though country makes up about only 1 per cent in comparison with top 25 spam-producing nations. The business enterprise of spamming isn't just lucrative but can be unregulated to some greater extent. The laws to prevent spam in India are missing. The IT Act, 2000 doesn't address this matter.\n\nUSA and also the European have previously enacted anti spam legislation.\n\nIn the United States spam is legally permissible good CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 provided the result is certain criteria. If the spam fails to comply with some of these requirements, then it is illegal.\n\nArticle 13 from the Western european Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (2002\/58\/EC) provides that the EU member States shall take appropriate measures to make sure that unsolicited communications for the reason for direct marketing are not allowed either without the consent of the subscribers concerned or in respect of subscribers who do not desire to receive these communications, the choice between these options to be determined by National Legislation.\n\nIdentity Theft\n\nThe IT Act, 2000 does not have any specific provision to deal with Identity theft. It really is clear that Indian politicians function not understand the problem related to personal id theft that India employees of outsourcing firms commit. When confronted with the controversy generated over leakage of non-public information of UK customers via an Indian internet marketing firm, pm of India has asked the data and Technology department and industry association Nasscom to consult all stakeholders and give ideas for modifications in the previous laws and, if needed, to ensure any breach of secrecy, illegal transfer of economic as well as other privileged information and some other kind of cyber crime is created a punishable offence.\n\nThey're a few of the important shortcomings from the Information Technology Act, 2000. Though an amendment was proposed within the Act in 2005, the bill has still not been passed as well as the balance also fails to address these complaints and shortcomings. It seems like quite evident that by the time the check is passed, it could have become obsolete and ineffective.\n\nChallenges to Legislative Measures\n\nCyber law in India is within its infancy and is struggling hard to fulfill the contemporary Information and Communication Technology (ICT) requirements. ICT Trends in India-2006, ICT Trends in India-2007, Cyber Security Trends-2007, etc have proved that India hasn't paid enough focus on the legal framework for the information society and legal enablement of ICT systems in India. To worsen your situation we've got a weak cyber and ICT peace of mind in India. Cyber and ICT security in India is definitely an 'ignored world' along with the same won't improve as a result of faulty cyber security technique of India. This precarious situation has lead to an insufficient critical ICT infrastructure protection in India. The critical ICT infrastructure protection and management in India have still not got the eye of government of India and industry players. To put it briefly, the ICT means of India needs rejuvenation so that we might possess a sound cyber law and effective ICT and cyber security.\n\nTo compound these problems, many victims of cybercrime are unwilling to launch their cases with all the authorities. The true magnitudes of cybercrime, along with demographic statistics on perpetrators and victims, are unknown since the majority of incidents of cybercrime go unreported. The real reason for this is that this victim is either frightened of police harassment or wrong media publicity. For minority and marginalised groups who already bear the brunt of media bias, reporting online harassment towards the police may simply draw further unwanted attention.\n\nThe good thing is that, despite these limitations, cyber crimes are detected and culprits are punished. In October 2002, the Delhi High Court restricted a person from selling pirated Microsoft software over an Internet auction site. A number of the big cities in India where cyber crime cells are available, there exists risk of improvement. It comes with an immense dependence on training, plus much more cities must have such cells.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt has an urgent requirement of unification of internet laws to cut back the confusion in their application. For e.g. for publication of harmful contents or websites like these, we've got Indian Penal Code (IPC), Obscenity Law, Communication Decency law, self regulation, Information Technology Act 2000 ,Data Protection Act, Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code etc but when they handle the topic vaguely therefore lacks efficient enforceability mechanism. On account of numerous Laws managing this issue there lays confusion as to their applicability, and none of the Law works with the subject specially in total. To get rid of the confusion in applicability of Legislation picking from various laws to tackle the challenge, i recommend unification of laws through all the internet laws to arrive at Code which can be efficient enough to cope with the many problems in connection with internet crimes. Although these legislations discuss the issue but they don't present an end for it. There's requirement of single Cyber legislation which can be co-ordinated to look after cyber crimes to all respects. With passage of time and betterment of technology in our date, has additionally led to numerous variety of I . t related crimes therefore changes are suggested to combat the issue equally fast.\n\nWhen you have been recently arrested and involved in an offence in Colorado, there are some important legal issues you need to think about ad address because the criminal process unfolds in your case.

{"text":"Daily Archives: October 10, 2011\n\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon University are assessing more efficient ways of tracking individuals. What do they have in mind? Assessing the consequence of an app that has to do with facial recognition and cloud-based data.\n\nThe idea of cloud-based data is just data acquired from the Internet. Their practices support the blending of a person's \"offline identity and online identity.\" In their study, funded by the National Science Foundation under the US Army Research Office, they aim to combine both facial recognition technology and information that can be found on the Internet. This means that in a matter of seconds, this software will be able to pick up an image from someone on the street, search it through the ridiculously large database of information that the Internet provides, and find out any necessary information of an individual. This includes the pictures\/information you have on Facebook, as well as information you may have on major organization websites. Keep in mind that this software can only be but so accurate, so this information is only for possible matches that the facial recognition picks up. Through some of their research, they were able to track people on a college campus to their online identities.\n\nOne possible issue this app faces is finding hardware to hold this amount of information. With the information people upload to the internet, there is a growing need for hardware that can support all of the information that they might be interested in.\n\nWhat we need to worry as cyber-security interest-seekers, is the opportunity such an app can bring to cyber criminals. Some people may argue, as written in the article, that if you have something you do not want the world to know, you should not release such information in the internet. However, this app is not just attracting information that users themselves post, but information that might be available from organizational events to which a person might have attended or even that organization's database of documented information. Is it not alarming that with certain algorithms CMU's app can obtain a person's Social Security Number? This may also bring up an issue with citizens who feel their exclusive rights of privacy are being violated.\n\nThese questions remain:\n\n-What additional benefits would this facial recognition have to the ones already in existence?\n\nLike this:\n\nAll you self taught hackers will be interested to know that this fellow, the producer and host of the tech show Hak5, Darren Kitchen has been running a hacked router out of plastic pineapple. This router tricks users into connecting to it instead of the actual router. He can eavesdrop on your conversation at the local coffee shop with his hacked router that's running this software. Kind of scary.\n\nHe's been at this since \"he was old enough to take apart an Atari 2600.\" He went from a 14 year old self taught hacker to the producer and host of the tech show Hak5. As they say on the video, the \"culture\" has come so far that it is acceptable to be called a geek, it's no longer an insult.\n\nKitchen isn't just sticking to hacking, he works for different companies to keep other hackers out. He says in the video, how he thought that he knew a lot about the technology before he started the show in 2005, but there's always more to learn when it comes to this field.

And even if you don't plug in your laptop, they have still found a pretty sneaky way to get your keys logged! Let us continue by talking about how hackers succeed in doing such feats and how the \"power-line exploit\" can be achieved even by ones that are less predisposed to such devious machinations.\n\nThe power-line exploit has the character recording the electric signals that keys being pressed by the user leak into the ground wiring. Since the pattern differs depending on the key that's being pressed, deciphering what the user has been typing is not that difficult at all. So, be careful when you're writing a romantic letter to your secretary or giving an order to nuke Racoon City, because someone might be recording your every key!\n\nOh, as for the other exploit (the one where you don't need to have the laptop plugged in so as to have your data stolen... well, that's even easier than the first. You get a cheap laser (you know, a little better than those things that you hang on your keychain) and point it at a shiny part of the laptop or an object on the table on which the laptop is standing so as to reflect the laser back into a receiver.\n\nThe receiver then records the modulations in the light beam in order to be translated into keystrokes at a later time.

The attackers used injected JavaScript to trigger flashing\nimages on the computers of their victims, causing them severe migraines and\nseizures.\n\nThe site is run and maintained by a nonprofit organization, the Epilepsy\nFoundation. Its goal is to provide a place where epileptics and family\nmembers can provide each other with support. The group had to close the\nsite briefly on Sunday to remove the malicious code and beef up security.\n\nKen Lowenberg, senior director of web and print publishing at the Epilepsy\nFoundation states, \"We are seeing people affected. It's fortunately\nonly a handful. It's possible that people are just not reporting yet -- people\naffected by it may not be coming back to the forum so fast.\"\n\nHackers launched the attack Saturday, March 22. They used a script to\ngenerate hundreds of messages with flashing animated GIF files attached.\nOn Sunday the griefers upped their assault injecting JavaScript into many\nposts. The script would redirect the users' page to a complex image\ncrafted to induce seizures. The malefic page was specially designed to\ntrigger seizures in both photosensitive and pattern-sensitive epileptics, two\nmajor classes of epilepsy.\n\nOne pattern sensitive epileptic, RyAnne Fultz, a 33-year old mother who\nregularly uses the group, was a victim of Sunday's attack. After initially\nclicking an innocent sounding post, her screen was filled with a large pattern\nof blinking squares. She says she \"locked up\". Fultz who\nworks IT Coeur d'Alene, Idaho explained, \"I don't fall over and convulse,\nbut it hurts. I was on the phone when it happened, and I couldn't move\nand couldn't speak.\"\n\nFortunately, Fultz was rescued by her 11-year-old son who came into the room\nand forced her gaze away from the screen and killed the process. Fultz\nemphasized how bad a seizure the attack caused, stating, \"It was a spike\nof pain in my head. And the lockup, that only happens with really bad\nones. I don't think I've had a seizure like that in about a year.\"\n\nBrowen Mead, a 24-year-old epilepsy patient in Maine, suffered from a daylong\nmigraine from the posts. She said it was worsened by the fact that she\nlingered on the page, trying to figure out who was responsible. She\nstates, \"Everyone who logged on, it affected to some extent, whether by\ncausing headaches or seizures.\"\n\nThere is some circumstantial evidence that the attack was carried out by the\ngroup Anonymous, who gained public attention for their hacks on the Church of\nScientology and successful protest campaign against the Church. Anonymous\nwas allegedly incensed by posts mentioning EBaums World, a site much despised\nby the group. Those who believe Anonymous to be behind the attack point\nto a since-deleted post on 7chan.org; an Anonymous stronghold that allegedly\norganized the attack.\n\nDespite their suffering, many epileptics expressed their support and\nappreciation for the site and the Epilepsy Foundation's work and\nresponse. Said Fultz, \"We all really appreciate them for giving us\nthis forum and giving us this place to find each other.\"\n\nEpilepsy comes in many forms with about 50 million people affected\nworldwide. Approximately 3 percent are photosensitive meaning that\nflashing lights and colors can trigger seizures. DailyTech had\npreviously discussed proof-of-concept\nattacks on medical implants such as pacemakers, but this is the first known\nreal world attack with the intent to physically injure.\n\nComments\n\nThreshold\n\nUsername\n\nPassword\n\nremember me\n\nThis article is over a month old, voting and posting comments is disabled\n\nOh c'mon... the hackers deserve punishment and the victims did not deserve it at all... but the idea, not the act, is funny due to its sickness and cleverness. I think a lot of you would at least smile if something like this was presented in a comedy, like Southpark.\n\nthis article really should mention the possibility that the CoS framed anonymous in this attack. They've been known to work against standard medial procedures for epileptics for years, and if their statements about the 'squelching' of anonymous made after the protests are any indication of their intent it's certainly not a far-fetched theory.\n\nThat's a fairy tale put out by Anonymous. Anonymous has a reputation to blame someone else. This is part of the \"joke\". Usually it is \"Ebaum's World\" or Fox TV, now it is CoS. That would be worth mentioning only if Anonymous wouldn't brag about their latest coup. But they do, on their *chan.org image boards and \"raid\" sites.\n\nLets torture EVERYONE after all just sneezing can cause brain cells to die.\n\nCute tricks like this don't exactly take a genius. A 12 year old could have done this, and probably did. An adult would have thought things through but then we do have people promoting random act of violence here.\n\nWe havent had a good lynching in a long time that _____(insert race ) must have done it we will show him not to be violent.\n\nI have to agree on execution. Who knows what total damage they could do to a person. But, because we live in a supposed civilized society and they won't allow us to outright execute scum like this, I propose life sentences in a new underground dungeon like facility never getting to see the light of day again. Seriously, should we be humane to the people that committed this act?\n\nya, strap them down, strap their head so they cant move and tape their eyelids open. put them in front of a screen that is big enough to wherever they look, they see that flashing screen for a LONG time!\n\nInflicting harm or even death is attempted murder, no matter what tool is used for it. They clearly wanted epileptic fits to happen and probably laughed about the idea that ten thousands of patients start shaking uncontrollably once they hit the button.\n\nby calling them \"hackers\" people will come to believ that all hackers are like that (especially once the mainstream media pick up on this). they are not hackers, but simply criminals who know a few things about using a computer, that is all.\n\nYes hackers. Only hackers could break into the forums system and inject code like that. Your typical script kiddie isn't creative or skilled enough to do something like this. Still, it is an interesting method of attack that has largely gone unexplored. Reminds me of the old Psicorps messages displayed on monitors from Babylon 5.\n\nyes, \"hackers\"; but not every hacker is a criminal. i'm just worried that once the mainstream media find out about this it will become like the \"OMG videogames are teaching our kids to kill!\"-hysteria. and jack thompson... and then the MPAA will say \"see we told you so, hackers are evil, down with the intarwebz\/piracy\" and so on.\n\ni think this has more to do with the \"hacker\" and \"cracker\" definitions.\n\na hacker used to be somebody who breaks in, steals nothing, and leaves a note on the table with how they got in.\n\na cracker used to be somebody who would do anything for their own personal gain, a common criminal if you will.\n\nthese... vermin, can't think of a better word, aren't hackers. else, they wouldn't have done anything and alerted the site's administrators on how to up their security. instead they used all means for personal gain, wether that is Scientology setting somebody up the bomb, or some sick sense of humor. thus, crackers.\n\nthat debate has long been lost though. there's no media who even bothers with a difference anymore, not even a tech site (which should know the difference)\n\nYou're still stereotyping too much with the hacker description. A hacker used to be someone who merely took something technical and exploited it (exploited not meaning in the security sense but the general older definition) to suit their desire, like hacking your clock radio to flip a relay that turns a lamp on.\n\nXSS attacks are quite common, the most common form of security vulnerability affecting websites infact. They are also quite easy to implement on vulnerable websites, all it takes is the attacker to submit some data (post a message in the forum for instance) that contains some Javascript code, and if the website is not properly validating user inputs (eg. new post submissions) then that javascript will get sent to the client web browser and executed. Eg...\n\nI guess everybody's a hacker now. It used to be that you had to do something that was difficult or beyond the ordinary IT skill set in order to qualify as a hacker.\n\nWriting a script to generate a bunch of forum posts doesn't really qualify for the \"hacker\" label to me. I could do that from scratch in like 30 minutes, and I haven't really written code since college. Why even use a script for that?\n\nAnyways, I hope they catch these guys and put them away for a long time.\n\n1) The general public isn't in IT 2) The general IT skill set does not include coding. 3) Coding skill set does not include exploiting website flaws. 4) Being able to do it <> having the motivation and intent to do so.\n\nWhatever happened to the term, \"crackers\"? Hackers are good for us; they find the \"holes\" and do not exploit them. Aren't crackers the ones that exploit the holes to do damage or steal? It seems to me that they have all been lumped into the same group, hackers, where they really should be differentiated. Or is cracker not used only because it is also a slang term for a white person?\n\nThe term cracker is seldom used because the general public is ignorant enough to not be able to hack their shoelaces, let alone realize and differentiate between those who do destructive vs constructive things. The media was once spoon-fed the term black-hat hacker because of their ignorance and even then they still didn't get it. hacker = evil, that's the way mankind is, that anything they don't understand and can't have control over equally must be evil.\n\ni agree with everyone here, this attack is pretty sick. but it's weird that Anonymous could be behind the attack. So they decide to wage war against The Church of Scientology and epileptics? that doesn't seem to make a lot of sense\n\nNo. You know flashing lights \"could\" cause a seizure which is a reasonable doubt that you'd certainly cause one. Now the last stretch you made was that you \"can die from said seizures\". Yes, you can die even while walking the dog, but death from a seizure is rare.\n\nIt could be claimed their motivation was irrelevant, that even at best their reckless acts could or did cause harm, and the court of public opinion or a jury would consider them cruel bastards who have to be punished (and rightly so to some extent), but attempted murder is a ridiculous claim. Remember how many people were potentially effected, we need not make ridiculous charges instead of consecutive sentences for all those people - could be many years in prison.\n\nYes, targeting a group of people who have a common disability could probably be prosecuted as a hate crime. But it's so much worse than that. I cringe when I read that an 11-year-old had to save his mother from this. What if her son was an 11-month-old or a toddler? This attack didn't just endanger epileptics, but their defenseless children as well. Even criminals hate people who harm or threaten children. If anyone goes to jail for this crime, they could lose their lives in prison.\n\nOh man. I'm one of the protesters against the Church of Scientology, and I really don't understand how people could be blaming us for this thing. Anyone can be anonymous on-line, people need to take a look at the websites these griefers operate on. The people who run sites like 7chan are against our protests. Scientology is against its members taking medication to stop them from getting seizures, for example, Tory \"Magoo\" Christman - \n\nthis is one of the dumbest things i have ever herd, if you know u could get hur from this, then why do these retards continue to use a computer....retards....ur just asking for some bored guy to hack ur comp and mess with you....RETARDS\n\nExcuse me? Are you saying that just because someone has a condition like this that they didn't ask for, they should be denied access to a computer? If so, you're a bigger fool than anyone else mentioned on this page.\n\nSorry, but I happen to know what it's like for some of these people, and making such a wisecrack comment about them (joke or not) is pathetic.\n\nObviously loves2spooge is about 12 years old. They certainly weren't asking for it, but on the other hand it does beg the question \"is surfing the net without some attempt to disable the browser's ability to display this kind of content really a wise thing to do?\".\n\nI consider it a bit like being blind - the blind shouldn't have to stay stuck inside their own home but when they want to cross the street they have to accept there are more things they must do to stay safe, given their vulnerability compared to others.\n\nGiven that the putative attack exploited ordinary web content, I don't think the individuals behind it can be held accountable for any crime. The affected visitors put themselves at risk by using an unregulated net on which they could be exposed to content of any kind. They knew this going in.\n\nI think the lesson we should take from this is that someone should create software that filters net content for potentially harmful images, lighting, flashing, etc.\n\nIn other words, it's not a crime to send out computer viruses because people put themselves at risk when they go on the internet, knowing full well that there was a possibility of getting a virus before they signed on.\n\nIt's also not a crime to hit someone with your car, because the pedestrian knew that there were cars on the road before they started to cross the street.\n\nI think the lesson we should take from this is that people should sit in a dark closet, wearing a football helmet and a holding a baseball to filter out potentially harmful actions of other people.\n\nViruses are not ordinary web content and last time I checked anti-virus software was a good idea and quite popular. And last time I checked jay-walking is illegal and it's not unreasonable to ask people to look both ways before crossing the street. If I were an epileptic I would certainly want to protect myself. A better analogy is walking around barefoot in the street and being surprised when EVENTUALLY you get glass stuck in your foot.\n\nquote: In other words, it's not a crime to send out computer viruses because people put themselves at risk when they go on the internet, knowing full well that there was a possibility of getting a virus before they signed on.\n\nSays who? Nobody has ever tried to cause bodily harm over the internet before, there are no precedents here. The people did not get a virus, the hacker redirected posts in their forum to a site that would cause epileptics to seizure.\n\nFurthermore last time i checked, hacking and manipulating private property is illegal, regardless of how you spin it. As such there is no reason to believe someone can not be held accountable for the damages they caused for such acts. In other words chances are if these people are caught, they will be charged with something...not that they will get caught...\n\nIm so glad isps can identify my limewire using grandma, but they can not find someone who has actually committed a crime..\n\nyes they can, because of the clear nature of the sight and the obvious intent of the crafted flashing images. You're arguing as if the \"hacking\" part is the issue when it is not- that was only the means. They may also be guilty of violations because of the means of breeching security but that is a separate charge (and possibly the only one which would be clear-cut enough to have more certainty of conviction, given supportive evidence).\n\nHopefully you will outgrow this twisted phase before you do something harmful, like having kids and subjecting them to the crap your parents must've put you through to make you feel that harming others is funny. Just something to think about - there's a reason why you think it's funny and it may not be your fault, initially, but it is if you perpetuate or use that as an excuse to act.\n\nI am all for tracking down the IP addresses--even through proxies--of these hackers and then sending malicious code that makes certain components of their computer(s) take in more and more voltage until the entire computer catches fire and\/or explodes.\n\nMy wife was diagnosed epileptic a few years ago. It's a serious condition which took quite some time to get as sorted out as it is, which is pretty good right now. She tried several different courses of medication with horrible side effects until finding her current Neurologist and Epilim.\n\nIf she had been effected by this hack (and oh yes! it is obviously hackers, not that this tars all hackers with the same brush) I'd be furious.\n\nI sincerely hope these idiots are tracked down and dealt with severely.\n\nWhy have we not heard more about this? Why the hell hasn't the government stated that those found responsible for said actions will be prosecuted with attempted murder? If a person has the knowledge of knowing what sets off a seizure, that same person should also know its possible to kill someone doing so. This in my mind is attempted murder!\n\nThey should be found and prosecuted to the full extent of the law, with many counts as registered users on the site!\n\nSo how about you government agencies out there leave the file sharing gurus alone and go after something that matters.\n\nWhat's the reward or challenge of attacking a public site which surely doesn't have as much security as you could find on a government's agency site or the likes? What's the fun in causnig pain to people at random, people whom you don't know and that don't have anything in common but a very serious illness which is already punishment enough for them, wether they deserve it or not?\n\nTerrorists at least are supposed to attack to make a statement, these stupids are not even in the level of the most low life terrorists you can find, they just inflict pain on people for the sake of it!\n\nThis must be the most pointless and at the same time the most evil hacking attack ever done"}

{"text":"1. Cars will become as (un)reliable as computers\n\nBill Gates allegedly once claimed that if Microsoft made cars, they'd cost $25 and do 1,000mpg. To which Jack Welch, head honcho of US car maker of GM, later retorted that if Microsoft made cars they'd crash twice a day and the airbag would ask if you're sure before deploying.\n\nThat was then. Today, cars and computing are on a convergence - you could say collision - course. Some cars have up to 150 or more computer chips on board. Renault, to take just one recent example, has chosen Google's Android OS to power its in-car kit.\n\nThe implication, then, is that cars will become increasingly reliant on computing for everything they do. And our experience of computing in just about every other walk of life is that it's far from 100 per cent reliable. How soon before an operating system crash turns into one that hurts more than just a few files?\n\n2. Malware takes on a whole new meaning\n\nIf cars could soon be crashing due to sheer computational complexity and human error in design and engineering, what about the scope for good old malice?\n\nWith cars becoming increasingly computerised, internet-connected and also sharing software platforms with more commonly used computing devices, can it really be long before viruses and other malware begins to target cars? Also, more and more cars are internet-connected, so an infection could happen at almost any moment.\n\nIf you start to think laterally, all sorts of sinister opportunities arise, and not just the apocalyptic, life-threatening sort. Imagine a future where all tyres have RFIDs. Could a tyre company send out a virus that detected tyres from rival companies and then hack the target vehicle to encourage faster tyre wear? If you can imagine it, maybe it's possible.\n\nWe've spoken to engineers at several car makers and they assure us that the way systems are compartmentalised and firewalled means it simply isn't possible for a virus to migrate from, say, the entertainment kit to a more safety-critical system like cruise control or lane departure correction.\n\nBut isn't that what they always say \u2013 that it could never happen \u2013 just before Armageddon strikes? You know it's true!\n\n3. Your car will get nicked by cyber thieves\n\nThe happy news is that this is already happening. Due to legislation drawn up with the best intentions and pertaining to easy access to the on-board diagnostic port, it's now possible to smash a a quarter light, plug in a cable and gain full operational access within a few moments.\n\nIf that's today, the nightmare scenario for tomorrow's connected cars is thieves doing the same job wirelessly over the internet, avoiding the need for any kind of break in. They simply hack and prime the car from a remote location and nip over when it's ready for pinching. WIth self-driving cars on the way, it's not inconceivable that thieves might find a way of driving your car away without even being present at the scene.\n\nAlready, cars from several brands can be unlocked remotely via a cellular connection. Seriously, people, it's going to happen.\n\n4. Your bunny-boiling ex will track you via GPS\n\nIf that sounds like a bad movie plot, try this for size. A self-contained GPS device that attaches to cars in an instant courtesy of a magnetic pad can be had for as little as \u00a3100.\n\nThe Back2you personal GPS tracker is a perfect example. Smaller than a pack of cards, it has both GPS and a GSM\/GPRS cellular adapter. Simply slap it onto a target vehicle \u2013 any steel bodied car is a suitable target \u2013 and then all that's required is a call to the device's mobile number.\n\nIt will then reply with a text revealing its current location and speed. It will even drop its dastardly master a text when it's running low on battery charge.\n\n5. Black boxes will become compulsory\n\nBlack boxes or devices that record various operational parameters and activities are generally seen as a good thing. They're commonly used in commercial aviation and provide crucial insight into the cause for any crash.\n\nThe same could very soon apply to cars. The technology is relatively simple. Indeed, some insurers are already experimenting with the idea with a view to setting premiums based on driving style. It's not a big step from there to imagine black boxes becoming compulsory.\n\nOn the face of it, the safety argument seems pretty compelling. On the other hand, do you really want electronic eyes watching your every move? It's the classic personal freedom versus broader public safety argument and we've an inkling the latter will eventually win out.\n\n6. Cyberjams and worse\n\nStories involving dunderheaded drivers who sheepishly follow satnav directions hundreds miles off course, into rivers, over cliffs and worse are already common place. It's classic one-last-thing local news bulletin material.\n\nBut in a world where cars are increasingly connected and automated, the scope for serious carnage increases. Take, for instance, the d\u00e9b\u00e2cle of Apple's own mapping software introduced with the iPhone 5 and iOS 6. Users reported widespread errors in mapping data.\n\nThen factor in a future where in-car system are increasing powered by smartphones. Already, models from MINI, Vauxhall, Mercedes and others are already available with smartphone-powered nav.\n\nYou're then in a situation where a cloud based mapping error or an OS update could instant render thousands or millions of handsets and in turn cars with incorrect data. That could cause traffic chaos, or worse.\n\nOn the subject of traffic, with in-car nav systems increasingly fed with streaming traffic data, what happens if there's a data glitch or someone hacks the data provider for nefarious reasons? Record breaking traffic jams or, worse, pile ups could ensue. And you could achive that with a single hack, rather than having to target individual cars.\n\n7. Say hello to your new four-wheeled overlords\n\nThis is it, the global catastrophe. The Skynet moment. Self-driving cars, you see, are on their way. They're inevitable and they're coming whether you like it or not.\n\nNow, for the most part, self-driving cars will be a very good thing. They won't be perfect. But then they don't need to be to improve upon the horrific standards of most human drivers and in turn dramatically reduce deaths and serious injuries on our roads.\n\nThey'll also have a dramatic positive benefit on all manner of modern life. For more on that, hop on over to our feature here. But with millions of fully automated cars running around, the scope for cataclysm whether by accident or malicious intent is pretty epic.\n\nTo be fair to cars, this falls into a broader category involving robots and perhaps event artificial intelligence too. But while a murderous robo-vacuum might be little more than amusing, millions of cars hell bent on destruction is another matter altogether. Anyway, keep thinking happy thoughts and maybe it will never happen. Either that or think twice when you vote in that robotic-car referendum 15 years from now"}

{"text":"Sections\n\nThursday, October 29, 2009\n\nHere's part two of my conversation with Gaurav Kanwal, Country Sales Manager \u2013 India, Consumer Products & Solutions, Symantec. Here, we discussed trends in cyber crimes, how users can protect themselves against malware, phishing and other attacks, and some India based statistics.\n\nTop trends in cyber crimes What are the trends that Symantec has been seeing in cyber crimes today? Are any new trends appearing?\n\nAccording to Kanwal, today's online thieves will stop at nothing to steal anything you've got: your money, your identity, even your good name. Their methods are getting more devious and sophisticated every day. Cyber criminals then sell the information on the online black market. Some trends that Symantec has recently witnessed include:\n\nExplosion of malware variants: Significant changes in the threat landscape over the last few years have dramatically altered the distribution profile for new malware. Today, instead of a single malware strain infecting millions of machines, it is much more common to see many millions of malware strains, each targeting a handful of machines.\n\nAdvanced Web Threats: Threats are becoming increasingly sneaky and complex. New scams, such as drive-by downloads, or exploits that come from seemingly legitimate sites, can be almost impossible for the average user to detect. Before the user knows it, malicious content has been downloaded onto their computer.\n\nSocial Networks: Online social networking continues to rise in popularity due to the numerous opportunities it provides. Social networking also provides phishers with a lot more bait than they used to have. Threats can come from all sorts of avenues within a networking site. Games, links and notifications are easy starting points for phishers. As society picks up one end of the social networking stick, it inevitably picks up the security problems on the other end.\n\nRising Spam Levels: We may not want it, but it still keeps coming. In October 2009, about 90 percent of all email messages were spam. The overall amount does fluctuate, but on average, the levels of spam have primarily risen rather than fallen. Big headlines almost always lead to more spam, and major headlines from 2009, such as the death of Michael Jackson, the H1N1 flu outbreak and the Diwali festival are examples of this. Furthermore, according to a recent Symantec report, spam and phishing information was the 2nd most requested item on the cyber mafia's underground economy.\n\nMalvertisements and scareware: Cybercriminals have figured out how to deceive people by presenting counterfeit messages. Examples of this include malicious advertisements or \"malvertisments,\" which redirect people to malicious sites, or \"scareware,\" which parade as antivirus scanners and scare people into thinking that their computer is infected when that's not the case.\n\nTo encourage users to install rogue software, cybercriminals place website ads that prey on users' fears of security threats. These ads typically include false claims such as \"If this ad is flashing, your computer may be at risk or infected,\" urging the user to follow a link to scan their computer or get software to remove the threat.\n\nAccording to a recent Symantec study, 93 percent of software installations for the top 50 rogue security software scams were intentionally downloaded by the user.\n\nAs of June 2009, Symantec has detected more than 250 distinct rogue security software programs. To make matters worse, some rogue software installs malicious code that puts users at risk of attack from additional threats.\n\nProtect yourself against malware, phishing and other threats How better can users be protected against malware, phishing and other threats?\n\nWhile the threat landscape becomes increasingly dangerous, users can take several simple measures to protect themselves. Norton recommends 10 top security strategies that users should employ:\n\nBeware of suspicious email. Scan emails before you open them. Do not launch unfamiliar executable (.exe) files or any attachments from unknown senders.\n\nWatch your network. If you discover an infected computer on your network, disconnect all computers from your network, scan them and clean any infected computers immediately.\n\nPatch. Upgrade. Repeat. Protect yourself by getting the latest operating system and security software updates and patches right away. Also upgrade your browsers to the latest versions as soon as they become available.\n\nUse strong passwords. Passwords should have at least eight characters and should combine alphanumeric and special characters ($, *, &, etc.). You should also change your passwords every 45-60 days.\n\nAvoid spam. When it comes to malware, spam is usually where it begins. Spam not only gobbles up your valuable time, it also hogs bandwidth and storage space. Report spam if you can, use antispam software whenever possible, and create separate accounts for friends and family, and additional accounts for other online activities.\n\nBe cautious. Do not give yourself a false sense of security by using free security software (freeware) as some of them carry malware which is designed to bait users and then up-sell them later under the promise of more robust protection \u2013 at a higher price than a paid-for solution.\n\nUnless you have a high level of technical competency, where you are able to build your own security solution with different point products, avoid reliance on freeware to protect your online environment.\n\nWhat else can be done to improve safe browsing? In addition to the measures listed above, Be Smart. If a \"friend\" emails and asks for a password or other information, call or email (in a separate email) that friend to verify that they were really who contacted you. The same goes for banks and businesses.\n\nFirst of all, they won't email you asking for passwords or account numbers. If you think it might be real, call the bank or business and ask. Or visit their website. Most have an address to which you can forward suspicious emails for verification. And always remember, don't reveal too much personal information online, because you never know who might use it against you and how.\n\n* Adults in India rank the highest when it comes to not having the basic security measures; 33 percent of adults in India do not have security software.\n\n* About one in four (24 percent) online adults sometimes shares a secret or something personal with someone online. Those in India (36 percent) are most likely to do so.\n\n* At 63 percent, India ranks highest in the number of parents who feel it is hard for them to make rules about the Internet because it wasn't around when they were kids.\n\n* Due to a rapidly growing Internet infrastructure, a burgeoning broadband population and rampant software piracy, India is expected to witness increased malicious activities.\n\nSymantec's Internet Security Threat Report (XIV) * India had the fifth highest number of broadband subscribers in the APJ region in 2008 and the third highest volume of malicious activity, with 10 percent of the regional total.\n\n* In the APJ region, India ranked first on worms and viruses attacks prevalence chart. Nine of the top 10 malcodes found in India consisted of worms (55 percent) and viruses (15 percent) that disabled security related processes, downloaded additional threats and stole confidential information.\n\n* According to the report, India had an average of 836 bots per day during 2008 and there were 103,812 distinct bot-infected computers observed in the country during the period. This was a staggering increase of nearly 250 percent from the previous Internet Security Threat Report.\n\n* Among the cities in India with the highest number of bot-infected computers, Mumbai figured at the top with 37 percent followed by Chennai at 24 percent and Delhi at 7 percent. Cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Calcutta, Surat, Ahmedabad, Cochin and Pune too had a sizeable share of bot-infected computers.\n\nI managed to catch up with Gaurav Kanwal, Country Sales Manager \u2013 India, Consumer Products & Solutions, Symantec, to find out more about this release. Of course, Symantec was kind enough to share a copy of the software.\n\nTo do that, cybercriminals are furiously writing and then rewriting new and unique pieces of malware, hoping to stay under the radar of threat signatures for as long as possible. Symantec security researchers see more than 200 million attacks on average every month, the vast majority of which are never-seen-before threats and delivered via the web.\n\nThe reality is, the signature approach and other traditional methods of security are not keeping pace with the sheer number of these threats being created by online criminals. Traditional security solutions are obsolete today.\n\nThe faster, safer and smarter Norton 2010 is anything but traditional. Norton 2010 harnesses the power of millions of users united against cybercrime and gives consumers the power to 'deny' digital dangers and 'allow' a safe online experience.\n\nNorton 2010 achieves this by leveraging a new and unique model of reputation-based security, codenamed Quorum, to attain unmatched detection of new malware and advance far beyond traditional signature and behaviour-based detection. In short, the code name Quorum takes the greatest weapon cyber criminals have in their arsenal \u2013 their ability to generate unique pieces of malware at an alarming rate \u2013 and turns that very weapon against them.\n\nThe other key and unique feature in the Norton 2010 products is the Norton Insight family of technologies, which uses extensive online intelligence systems to proactively protect the PC and keep users informed of the security and performance impact of files and applications that they encounter in their everyday online experience. The suite consists of:\n\nNorton Download Insight \u2013 Uses extensive online intelligence systems leveraging reputation to proactively protect your PC. Analyses and reports on the safety of new files and applications before users install and run them.\n\nNorton System Insight \u2013 Provides features and easy-to-understand system information to help keep PCs performing at top speed. Automatic and on-demand application optimisation rejuvenates application performance. Provides a view of recent events on the computer, providing the information required to research and analyze PC issues. Performance graphs help pinpoint what's causing a computer to slow down.\n\nNorton Threat Insight \u2013 Provides details on threats that have been detected on your PC \u2013 including useful information on where it came from (the URL) and when it was initially encountered.\n\nNorton Insight Network \u2013 Leverages a cloud-based approach unique to Symantec. Based on the technology codenamed Quorum, it takes cloud-based security beyond traditional blacklists and whitelists. It uses a statistical analysis of file attributes based on billions of scans on millions of computers to identify the trust level of a file. This way Norton can identify files to be trustworthy or untrustworthy that would otherwise fall into the grey area of the unknown with only traditional security methods.\n\nAdditional key technologies:\n\nSONAR 2 \u2013 Sophisticated second-generation behavioural security technology that detects entirely new threats based on their suspicious actions, without the need for traditional fingerprints. Leverages data from the reputation cloud, firewall, network communications (IPS), and file attributes such as location on the PC, origin information, etc., to decide when to detect a program as a threat.\n\nNorton Safe Web (Norton Internet Security only) \u2013 Website rating service that annotates Google, Yahoo! and Bing.com search results with site safety ratings to warn users about sites that may pose a danger to them. It also includes ecommerce safety ratings to help users make safer online shopping decisions.\n\nOnlineFamily.Norton (Norton Internet Security only) \u2013 Norton Internet Security 2010 users can opt to try a subscription to OnlineFamily.Norton, a new Web-based service that keeps parents in the loop on their kids online lives and fosters communication about what's appropriate and inappropriate behaviour on the Internet.\n\nQuorum -- reputation-based technology So what's this Quorum -- the reputation based technology -- all about?\n\nNorton 2010 products leverage a revolutionary new technology, codenamed Quorum, which uses cloud-based intelligence to identify malware in an entirely new way beyond traditional signatures and behavior-based detection. With more than 3 years in the making, the technology, codenamed Quorum, is a real-time reputation system that is unique to Norton. It tracks files and applications and dozens of attributes such as age, download source, digital signature, and prevalence.\n\nThese attributes are combined using numerous algorithms to determine a reputation. As a file is distributed across the Internet and these attributes change, the code name Quorum updates the reputation of the file. This reputation is especially important when a file is new, likely to be a threat, and traditional defenses are not likely to detect it.\n\nThe reputation-based technology, codenamed Quorum, leverages the tens of millions of users in the worldwide Norton Community Watch who choose to anonymously contribute data about the applications running on their systems.\n\nThis data is fed into a reputation engine where dozens of attributes for each file, such as age, download source, digital signature, and prevalence are combined to determine its reputation. Without ever having to ask the user, Norton can infer with an extremely high degree of accuracy the likelihood of an unknown application being good or bad.\n\nWhy is it that it's likely that the Internet security industry will be building on technologies like Quorum for the next 10 years?\n\nCurrent security solutions are designed around the fingerprinting model. This works like a \"wanted\" poster \u2013 warning users against dangers that have already been identified, or \"fingerprinted\". However, it's woefully inadequate when faced with new threats.\n\nThis will change however with the introduction of the new security model, codenamed Quorum, that's found in the Norton 2010 products. The reputation- based technology takes the greatest weapon cyber criminals have in their arsenal \u2013 their ability to generate unique pieces of malware at an alarming rate \u2013 and turns that very weapon against them.\n\nThat is important because the fact is cybercriminals are now destroying lives rather than just computers. Every three seconds an identity is stolen, and 1 in 5 people becomes a victim of cyber crime.\n\nAnother reason why the industry will build on the reputation-based technology, codenamed Quorum, is that traditional security solutions \u2013 signature files and behavioural heuristics \u2013 alone, are obsolete. Cyber criminals are furiously writing and then rewriting new and unique pieces of malware \u2013 Symantec sees more than 200 million attacks on average every month.\n\nFurthermore, these threats are polymorphic \u2013 they are able to hide because every instance changes slightly to evade detection by conventional defenses. Each change keeps the malware active, but it modifies the file's signature and renders security vendors' technologies (both signatures and heuristics\/behaviors) all but useless against the new breed of unknown threats.\n\nThe Web also greatly eases the distribution of polymorphic threat variants since most threats today are delivered via Web-based attacks. Norton 2010 addresses these by using the reputation-based technology, codenamed Quorum, against the bad guys by making such a new file capable of being detected because of its poor, un-established reputation.\n\nThat is why the information security industry will be building on technologies like code name Quorum for the years to come.\n\nThe advanced SONAR 2 technology found in the Norton 2010 products is a sophisticated second-generation behavioural security technology that detects entirely new threats based on their suspicious actions, without the need for traditional fingerprints. It leverages data from the reputation cloud, firewall, network communications (IPS), and file attributes such as location on the PC, origin information, to decide when to detect a program as a threat.\n\nSONAR 2 intelligently measures feedback across the PC to make high accuracy decisions, seamlessly switching between protection types as needed. It uses real-time, online intelligence and proactive monitoring to detect and stop new threats before traditional definitions are available.\n\nThis system can stop today's rapid-fire attacks even before traditional signature-based definitions are available because it watches out for typical behaviors performed by malware. This technology feature makes the Norton 2010 range superior to other products in the market.\n\nPart two of my conversation with Gaurav Kanwal will focus on trends in cyber crimes, how users can protect themselves againsy malware, phishing and other attacks, and some India based statistics.\n\nMonday, October 26, 2009\n\nHere are the excerpts from the Global Semiconductor Monthly Report, September 2009, provided by Malcolm Penn, chairman, founder and CEO of Future Horizons. There are a lot of charts associated with this report. Those interested to know more about this report should contact Future Horizons.\n\nJuly's WSTS results showed the industry recovery is continuing to gain momentum, with total semiconductor growth down 9.6 percent versus July 2008, up from minus 25.8 percent in June 2009. This is in line with our negative 14 percent year-on-year growth rate for the whole of 2009 and our 12 percent sequential third quarter growth projection.\n\nIndeed, these forecasts are now virtually in the bag, only a further economic meltdown of Lehman's Brothers proportion can now derail the chip market recovery. Not that this is out of the question, given so few lessons have yet been learned and little has culturally changed in the banking and financial sectors, but at least for now the chip market recovery is in full swing.\n\nIn short, there is more upside potential to our forecasts than downside risks; it's going to be a really lovely day tomorrow.\n\nLet the good times roll \u2026 tomorrow's been a long time coming!\n\nThere have been wild fluctuations when looked at on an individual monthly basis meaning no single month's data is a good indicator of the underlying trends. Each month is thus just another peg in the ground, especially during a period of rapidly changing conditions.\n\nWhilst June's minus 25.8 percent year-on-year growth looked much closer to our original minus 28 percent forecast for the year, rather than the minus 14 percent, we reforecast last month, this graph is backward looking and does not take into account (a) the prospective second-half-year rebound and (b) the fact we will be measuring future 12:12 growth rates against a dynamic whereby the 2009 numbers are trending up whereas the 2008 numbers were trending down, amplifying the impact of the 2009 positive monthly trends. As demonstrated by July's results, we can now expect to see this number to trend upwards for the rest of 2009, albeit with continuing acute month-on-month fluctuations.\n\nAs can be seen, there is very little sensitivity now to the 2009 outcome, with 2009's market coming in at around $ 215 billion.\n\nMathematically, a $215 billion 2009 chip market would result in a market the same size as it was in 2004, a five-year CAGR of 0.2 percent. An ideal number for the short sighted to drive nail a in the chip market 'told you growth is over' coffin. To mis-quote Jerry Sanders III \u2026 \"Nuts\". CAGRs are notoriously flawed and should all come with 'Numbers Can Seriously Damage Your Health' warning. Depending on your start and finish point, you can derive any growth number you want. As shown in Figure E4, CAGRs for the industry over successive five-year periods from 1999 to 2010 vary dramatically, from 0.2 percent to 12.7 percent. Caveat Emptor.\n\nAs with all industry statistics, numbers need to be interpreted very carefully indeed, especially in an industry where the supply-side dynamics are driven by long (five year) design and investment decisions and the demand-side works on lead-times measured in months.\n\nThe reality is there is no substitute for a long-term plan with clear CEO vision and direction. History has shown sound industries are built around visionaries and leaders; falling foul only when greed and the pen pushers take control. As with life, even good businesses grow old and eventually loose momentum, giving way to the new upstarts vying for control of their chosen patch. It is never easy, however, to hand over the reins and growing old gracefully is difficult to achieve.\n\nEven more difficult is reviving an aged organisation to compete against the new status quo. As history has shown over and over again, it is impossible to turn a company around once it has allowed itself to become 'old', where 'old' is much more an attitude of mind than physical age.\n\nNo amount of product pruning or reorganisation can downsize or rejuvenate a time-expired organisation. Better by far not to have allowed the firm to stagnate in the first place, which again points back to vision, leadership and a clear, well-executed long-term strategy. Loose sight of the direction and\/or sacrifice tomorrow for today and you loose control of the company.\n\nDespite conventional wisdom, there are more than enough chip market opportunities to fuel significant growth over the next many years, so long as you have the courage to ride the chip market ups and downs. In the words of Irving Berlin, and a song that could well have been the anthem of the chip industry \u2026the only clear message is \"It's A Lovely Day Tomorrow\".\n\n\"It's a lovely day tomorrow, tomorrow is a lovely day, Come and feast your tear-dimmed eyes on tomorrow's clear blue skies, If today your heart is weary, if every little thing looks gray, Just forget your troubles and learn to say, tomorrow is a lovely day.\"\n\nAccording to Sathya Prasad, president, SEMI India, India is abundantly endowed with solar radiation \u2014 > 300 sunny days a year and 5 trillion kWh of solar energy per year available across the land mass. \"Even 0.5 percent of India's land mass generating solar electricity can meet the entire power needs of the country in the year 2030,\" he said.\n\nIndia PV end market \u2013 opportunities Several opportunities exist in the India PV end market, such as:\n\nIndian PV manufacturing background India has a long history of solar\/PV activity. CEL and BHEL have been around from the 1970s. Pioneering R&D work has also been done. The Indian space program was one of the early drivers. A few private companies have been in operation for ~two decades.\n\nThere has been a rising production capacity in India. This is extending from module to cell manufacturing. Also, the industry is now getting into downstream opportunities.\n\nUpdate on solar power farms BP Acharya, CMD, APIIC, highlighted that 5,000 acres solar power farm to set up plants at Kadiri; offer letters are being issued to AES, Lanco, Sunborne (thermal and PV) besides Titan.\n\nOver Rs 3,000 crores in investment is envisaged of which Sunborne alone will be Rs 2,000 crores. Social infrastructure is also good, and that, the proximity to Bangalore International airport a big advantage looking at global markets. He added, \"The farm will also be apt since those in FabCity have a readymade domestic market.\"\n\nAcharya said that an MoU with Fraunhofer Institute will be signed during the Solarcon India 2009 to set up a center in FabCity to help Indian companies and also facilitate better market access. It will will address certification and testing requirements besides training; is also looking at an undergraduate program; also looking at a R&D center.\n\nHe said that BHEL is the new entrant showing interest in FabCity of Rs 500 crores investment. There will soon be a draft state policy after the national solar mission.\n\nIndia an emerging solar\/PV leader Sankar Rao, MD, Titan Energy Systems, said that Hyderabad based companies had achieved 6-7 GW capacity in only a few years.\n\nRao added, \"The global PV segment has been growing at 30 percent annually for the last five years. India has been making significant progress as a player in photovoltaic modules and panel manufacturing units and stands a good chance of emerging as a global leader in solar PV technology.\"\n\nHe added that according to an industry analyst, there will be 190,000 to 1.3 million in employment generation by 2018. \"Innovation in financial sector is a need. Also, the solar\/PV target is to achieve grid parity by 2020 in India.\"\n\n\"Apart from off-grid applications such as home lighting, grid connected solar\/PV farms are increasingly becoming attractive in India and will help solve the growing gap between energy supply and demand. This, coupled with adoption of new technology will drive growth of the Indian solar\/PV space exponentially. We also expect more players to enter the industry in the near term enticed by the market opportunity.\"\n\n\"Reduction in the cost of the modules is becoming possible through increasing stabilized efficiencies and deposition rates of the materials. Current improvements in both product and manufacturing process technologies will see per module price at retail level dropping to Rs. 50 by end of 2010. Anticipating similar cost reductions in BOS spectrum, dropping of total system cost to sub Rs. 100 levels by end of 2011 is also a reality.\"\n\nThe SOLARCON India 2009, will be held from Nov. 9-11 at the Hyderabad International Convention Centre.\n\nMonday, October 19, 2009\n\nHere are excerpts of some key presentations made on day 1 at the recently held International Electronics Forum 2009 (IEF 2009), in Geneva, Switzerland, from Sept. 30-Oct. 2, which was held under the auspices of the Geneva Chancellerie D'Etat & Istitut Carnot CEA LETI. I hope to be presenting full reports as well.\n\nMay I also take this opportunity to thank Malcolm Penn, chairman and CEO, Future Horizons, as well as Gemma Fabian.\n\nMaria Marced emphasised both investment and collaboration as a way forward for the semiconductor industry to recover from this recession. Based on the fact that every known recession has been followed by a strong recovery in demand the Taiwanese wafer foundry TSMC is expected to increase its earlier projected dollar investment plans substantially. Its new manufacturing GigaFab (Fab12-Phase4) will eventually be able to supply 150,000 wafers per month.\n\nIt will also being investing in people and will be adding 30 percent more R&D engineers to its existing 1200 worldwide and will also be adding 15 percent to its existing design technology engineers.\n\nMaria stressed that it is innovation in our products and continued R&D that will improve semiconductor company margins. R&D costs and time-to-market can be reduced by processing equipment suppliers, IDMs and fabless companies collaborating with foundries for future success in finer geometries. TSMC has already announced that it has set up a development laboratory in a partnership with IMEC of Louvain, Belgium.\n\nThere were some questions about possible overcapacity as some plants in China were coming on line, but Maria thought differently as TSMC was already running at 90-95 percent of capacity today. There even could be a shortage of processed wafers in 2010.\n\nBrian Harrison of Numonyx, a memory company jointly owned by STMicroelectronics and Intel, made a robust case for its latest technology Phase-Change Memory (PCM). Describing the history of non-volatile memory Brian showed its dramatic growth driven by both a continuously reduced cost-per-bit and new applications that needed its ability to support firmware that could be updated 'down the wire' or 'across radio networks'.\n\nThe industries' most recent entrant, PCM, is claimed to be a disruptive technology that will enable the next wave of innovation. In the right application it will replace both DRAM and flash memories \u2014 replacing these because of either speed, size, retention reliability or lower energy or a combination of all virtues.\n\nNumonyx is already sampling 128Mbit 90nm product and has cost reduction 45nm process in development that is aimed at 1Gbit products. Samsung is also working on products in this field. The two companies are collaborating on package and interface standards.\n\nFiner and finer geometries are still possible and there seems no immediate end, to the progress of process development. Jean-Marc needs a variety of processes to cater for broad application markets, that include automotive, industrial, medical and radio, so STMicroelectronics needs to maintain leads in low-power CMOS, smart power, analogue, discretes and MEMs markets.\n\nTo maintain this present agile supply chain and fund future development the company believes in growth in its own fabs in Crolles, Agrate, Tours and Catania, which gives it a key competitive differentiator. It then leverages these internal resources to deliver its business units the best price and foundry-like supply by using multiple sources.\n\nAs an example, STMicroelectronics joins European development programmes and works closely with laboratories such as CEA\/LETI and other European institutes and universities. It is also involved in process development with the International Semiconductor Development Alliance (ISDA) which involves AMD, Chartered Semiconductor, IBM, Infineon, NEC, Samsung, and Toshiba. A 28nm CMOS process is being developed, which will be ready for volume production in 2010 at four sites.\n\nWhat matters to Jean-Marc is keeping the ability to produce silicon subsystems for its chosen markets and this can be done either on-chip or by using 3-D integration techniques, such as stacking RF chips on top of digital CMOS within a single package. He finds these technologies important to keep in-house rather than going to an open-market foundry, although he does not rule out joint manufacturing plants with ISDA members.\n\nST-Ericsson is the fabless company created from elements from semiconductor companies STMicroelectronics and NXP and communications OEM Ericcson. It has about 8,000 staff, mostly in R&D, and has sales of about $3.6B in semiconductor products and subsystems.\n\nAlain saw the mobile handset market fall less than others in the recession and sees broadband communications as an economic stimulant in the future. Broadband communications, which includes mobile broadband, is a key enabler of a country's prosperity. It increases economic activity as it allows people to be better at their job, and allows increased learning and health.\n\nPeople are moving from fixed broadband to mobile and this is good as the infrastructure is easier to maintain and upgrade. Next year mobile broadband usage (mobile handsets, PCs and other platforms) will overtake fixed as the mobile revolution moves forward and gives better performance than DSL.\n\nThe mobile phone is adapting better to consumer behaviour and market demand and is expected to take over many of the applications of the PC, GPS and TV. New consumers have grown up with the mobile phone and the Internet and use it naturally as a source of information and their social empowerment.\n\nSo, when LTE rolls out next year they are expected to use smart phones and other mobile connected devices as first choice over the fixed Internet option. Added to this is the quiet rise of machine\u2013to-machine radio communication and Alain predicts 50 billion machines will be communicating in this M-to-M way in five years time.\n\nHigh performance trends in semiconductors not only involve process improvements, but also assembly technology. Nobuako Miyakawa proposed that because of the increased impedance of the long wires used on today's large chips and the need for mixed process technologies for RF applications 3-D stacking technologies must be brought in. This will increase frequency performance and lower power consumption.\n\nHonda is developing a 3-D wafer-to-wafer stacking method with the low interconnection resistance of 0.7 ohm using a Through-Silicon Via (TSV) and a bump technology. Direct connectivity between the layer bumps and the TSV is now improved using only five processing steps and the yields of the chips, which are naturally smaller than using VLSI, are also higher.\n\n3-D verses 2-D chip assembly progress in the laboratory is good and volume manufacture will be well timed for the rise in activity after the recession. All measurements on prototypes are carried out on 8-inch 180nm wafers and meet MIL STD and JEDEC reliability tests.\n\nIt is also thought that this 3-D chip technology may allow some process nodes to be skipped in the process technology roadmap.\n\n\"The Role Of Semiconductors In Cloud Computing\" \u2014 Young Sohn, CEO, Inphi\n\nAnytime\/anywhere computing and communication is the driving force behind a number of high-growth semiconductor market segments. One of these is in the hardware required to speed and reduce power in servers and networks in the data centres used for 'cloud computing'.\n\n'Cloud Computing' customers do not usually own the computer hardware or infrastructure they use and so 'time share' or 'pay as you go' usage from a third-party supplier, such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft or Yahoo. Cloud computing allows user companies to avoid the large initial capital expenditure and the hiring of computer experts.\n\nThis gives a low barrier of entry to new users, which can use such cloud systems and off-the-shelf applications via a web browser. The cloud infrastructure is usually interconnected servers in data centres and these have a large bandwidth and fast and large storage.\n\nInternet traffic is growing at 44 percent even in 2009, driven by services such as YouTube and facebook. Spend on cloud computing will be 25 percent of all incremental IT spend growth by 2012. This growth means big opportunities for high-speed hardware particularly to cope for video applications and hardware and design concepts that can reduce power in memory and processor farms.\n\nAs an example a major data centre has 70,000 server boards with a memory of 192 GB per server \u2013 so millions of dollars can be saved in energy and server cooling charges.\n\nYoung gave other examples on the impact of system speed. Amazon claims that every 100msec of latency costs them one percent in sales; Google claims that an extra 500msec of search time drops traffic by 20 percent; and a financial broker said that they could lose $4M per msec if their trading platform is 5msec behind the competition.\n\nThis market is ripe for a new generation of innovative semiconductor solutions in the energy efficiency, performance and security arena.\n\nFriday, October 16, 2009 TheAutomotive market challenges There has been an increasing integration and system complexity. These include:\n\n* Increasing electrification of the vehicle (replacing traditional mechanical systems). * Mounting costs pressure leading to integration of more functionality in a single ECU. * Subsequent increase in use of high-performance sensor systems has driven increased MCU performance needs TheThursday, October 15, 2009\n\nToday, I received two wonderful reports \u2014 one, highlighting the top 5 high growth markets driving (semiconductor) recovery, and two, the top 10 hot and emerging technology platforms well poised to profoundly impact manifold sectors across the globe while offering potential high RoI for investors!\n\nFirst, semiconductors! Semico Research has come up with a report that highlights the top 5 high growth segments driving growth and recovery in the semiconductor segment. For the record, 2009 is likely to see the global semiconductor industry decline by 12.5 percent. The top 5 segments according to Semico Research are:\n\nHey, there really seems to be a lot of light at the end of the tunnel for the consumer electronics industry!\n\nOn netbooks, I think Intel needs to be given most, if not, all of the credit. Here's what iSuppli has to say in its fast facts for Intel's Q3 results:\n\n* Intel also capitalized on the continued rise in demand for netbook PCs. The company dominates the netbook microprocessor market with its Atom chip. iSuppli predicts global netbook shipments will rise to 22.2 million units in 2009, up 68.5 percent from 13.2 million in 2008.\n\n* While Atom represents only a small share of Intel's total revenue, its profitability is disproportionately high. \"Netbook microprocessors are a high-margin product because they utlilize old technology,\" said Matthew Wilkins, principal analyst, compute platforms, for iSuppli. \"The Atom is based on the old Pentium M microprocessor and uses a mature manufacturing process. Because of this, Intel is getting very high yields and an extremely high margin on the Atom.\"\n\nOn PNDs, SatNav has recently introduced a Bluetooth enabled multifunction PND. Also, In-Stat reports that the worldwide unit shipments for PNDs will reach approximately 56 million units in 2012.\n\nHowever, iSuppli has just sent out a story to me, saying that PNDs have now entered a period of slowing growth, spurring companies throughout the supply chain to re-evaluate their business models. Interesting!\n\nAs for digital TVs, according to DisplaySearch, developed markets are starting 2009 with strong growth and emerging markets are transitioning from CRT to LCD TVs faster than expected. However, plasma (PDP) TV is expected to fall about 2 percent Y\/Y to 14.1 million in 2009 after strong 28 percent growth in 2008. As per iSuppli, OLED-TV revenue will likely rise by a factor of 240 by 2015\u2014but still remain a niche. Let's see!\n\nDisplaySearch's total global TV forecast is 200.4 million units in 2009, down 3 percent Y\/Y, the first decline in total shipments in recent memory as the global recession and rising unemployment continue to take a toll on demand. However, the slowdown will be temporary as the worldwide economy emerges from recession and new markets enter the initial stages of the flat panel and digital TV transition.\n\nAmong DVDs, Samsung has introduced its first internal Blu-ray disc combo drive with BD-R and 8X BD-ROM read speed. Also, Flex-DVD is the latest technology in the DVD replication industry. This single layer format has the same capacity of a DVD-5 (4.7GB for standard size and 1.1GB for 3\u2033 Mini DVD), but is half the thickness of the standard DVD.\n\nVideo game consoles \u2014 I find it quite interesting! It has been reported that the only products to see a decline in unit shipments in the second quarter were handheld video games, video game consoles, etc. Watch this market segment!\n\nNow, to the top 10 hot and emerging technologies! According to a report from Frost & Sullivan, these are:\n\nFlex-DVD, above, is a great example of flexible electronics. Green IT \u2014 although a much abused term, it has certainly been on the top of the charts for quite some time now. Battery technologies and energy storage \u2014 yes, certainly. There are rightful places for CIGS solar \u2014 a point also made by Dr. Robert Castellano of The Information Network \u2014 and smart materials, as well as lasers and white biotech.\n\nWell, what do you think folks? Do you agree with these top 5 and top 10 lists?\n\nTuesday, October 13, 2009\n\nContinuing with my coverage of the fortunes of the global semiconductor industry, here's the global semiconductor industry sales forecasts, by Mike Cowan. Here, I'd like to acknowledge Mike for sharing his findings and thank him for his continuous tracking of the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe presently updated global S\/C sales forecast estimates are based upon the recently published August 2009 actual sales numbers released by the WSTS (posted on their website on Oct 6 (\n\nThe table details the latest, updated forecast numbers covering the next six quarters, that is, from 3Q09 through 4Q10, respectively, as well as for the full years of 2009 and 2010.Source: Mike Cowan\n\nAs the table shows, the latest forecast updates for years 2009 and 2010 chip sales forecast estimates both increased by +1.5 percent to $208.5 billion and $225.4 billion, respectively, compared to last month's sales forecast estimates of $205.4 billion and $222.1 billion, respectively.\n\nThe updated 2009 and 2010 chip sales forecast estimates correspond to yr-o-yr sales growth forecast estimates of -16.1 percent and +8.1 percent, respectively, which represent a continuing improvement compared to last month's sales growth prediction of -17.4 percent for 2009, but maintaining the status quo for 2010 at +8.1 percent.\n\nIt should be highlighted that the actual cumulative YTD (through August) sales number of $133.82 billion represents a YTD sales decline of 21.3 percent relative to last year's August actual cumulative YTD sales of $170.12 billion.\n\nRemember that the model is dynamic, that is, is recalculated each month as the year plays out; therefore today's latest, updated full year sales growth prediction will not sit still but will evolve over the coming months.\n\nAdditionally, the model also projects a sales forecast estimate for next month, namely for September, 2009. Thus September's (actual) sales forecast estimate is projected to be $21.15 billion, which corresponds to a 3MMA sales forecast estimate of $19.68 billion as normally published by the SIA.\n\nOne of the 'guilty' pleasures of blogging is that I've managed to make a whole lot of friends from all over the world. It is amazing to see how much of interest folks have on India, and especially on the Indian semiconductor and the Indian solar\/PV industry.\n\nWell, one such gentleman, who I recently got acquainted with over cyberspace is Mohan Chandra, president, Semi Solar Technologies, from Merrimack, NH, USA.\n\nMohan's first query to me was: \"Saw your blog, which came through my LinkedIn messages. How does India plan to get onto 20 GW of solar power by 2020 without support from the silicon materials industry (viz. polysilicon through to wafers)?\"\n\nInteresting! As far as I'm aware, efforts are on to build an ecosystem here in India, so this bit would surely get addressed, if it already hasn't!\n\nNow, being in India, it is not easy for me to get in touch with companies based in the US, especially those in the solar photovoltaics field. Therefore, I also asked Mohan to brief me a bit about Semi Solar Technologies.\n\nAccording to Mohan, he started Semi Solar technologies as a consulting company to cater to the requirements around the world in the semiconductor regime, as well as the photovoltaic industry.\n\n\"The idea was to see how best to push new and better technology through to different companies operating around the world rather than to build plants, equipment, run turnkey operations or to take up manufacturing ourselves. Things have changed considerably since we first started (which was just a little over two years ago!!\n\n\"Since the requirement of our clients have been to lean on us to put up plants and to design and build equipment. In the photovoltaic industry, we have the technology to take it from metallurgical grade silicon to silicon solar cells and modules for our clients.\n\n\"This will mean the technology to manufacture hyper pure raw material, polysilicon and then to take it through crystal growing, wafering and cell manufacture. We therefore advise how to build integrated plants or just parts of the PV plant. Very few such teams are available around the world.\"\n\nSemi Solar tries to get out in the field and if a company already exists, it attempts to see how best to introduce technology to improve the production and lower the product cost, or if it a new plant, then it would implement as many new technologies as possible to get out low cost material.\n\nAs per Mohan, Semi Solar has now put together a team of physicists, chemists, chemical, electrical, electronic, software and controls engineers. Within the team, it has more than 25 patents with many in the works mostly in the silicon area.\n\nHe added: \"The coming years, we will see many of this kind of activities because of the large PV projection. So, it is one that will be slowly be taken out of the hands of the few controlling manufacturers and will become more or less a small to medium business operation with severe competition.\" An interesting observation, that!\n\nSaturday, October 10, 2009\n\nThe India Semiconductor Association (ISA) recently led a delegation to the UK from Sept. 28-Oct. 2, in association with the UKTI. The objective of this delegation was to provide a platform for Indian and UK based chip design and embedded software companies to explore opportunities for collaboration.\n\nThe first day's highlight was a networking reception with attendees of the earlier RAE Solar Thermal Powerplants seminar, where the delegation exchanged business information.\n\nThe next day involved a trip to Bath \u2014 to the Bath Ventures Innovation Center. A networking lunch was hosted by Silicon South West \u2014 the organization that provides regular networking events and news, and national and international promotion for the South West of England's microelectronics sector \u2014 the largest concentration of silicon designers outside of the Silicon Valley.\n\nFollowing the networking lunch, the ISA delegation was introduced to the local semiconductor sector by Silicon South West. Simon Bond, founder of Silicon South West, Low Carbon South West and Mobile Innovation Camp, and Innovation Center Director for Bath Ventures, presented an overview of the semiconductor sector in the region, and the role Silicon South West and Bath Ventures, in particular, play in the evolution of the sector in the region and more widely.\n\nDay 3 of the delegation's visit was marked by a seminar \u2014 India: Myths and Realities. This seminar presented an opportunity for the UK and India based companies to share their views on opportunities, barriers and modes of engagement, based on personal experiences and circumstances. The seminar provided an opportunity to explore topics rarely covered in an open business debate.\n\nDr. Omkar Rai, Senior Director, STPI and leader of the ISA-led delegation, provided an overview of the Indian semiconductor industry. This was followed by two case studies \u2014 Choosing India, followed by Choosing the UK. A round table on \"Where are the opportunities for UK-India semiconductor partnerships\" whetted the appetite of the audience.\n\nSession two featured two interesting case studies \u2014 Experiences of India, followed by Experiences of the UK. These were followed by the second round table \u2014 \"How should companies engage? What should they expect in practice ?\"\n\nSession 3 started off with Was Rehman, India ICT Sector Specialist, presenting the UKTI's Global Value Chain Program. This was followed by a case study titled \"Realizing the potential of India.\" Later, delegates networked over lunch, which was organized by the UKTI.\n\nThe next day, the ISA delegation proceeded to Cambridge, for the East of England International (EEI) offices. EEI is all about enabling business in the UK's most innovative region. It also delivers UKTI's services and products in the region, and offers a wide range of services, including developing international strategies, providing in-depth information on target markets, cultural briefings and identifying business opportunities.\n\nThe highlight of the morning session was an introduction to the East of England semiconductor sector. EEI's presentation introduced the delegates to the region and talked about the characteristics that have led it to become a leading center technology innovation in the UK. TTP, one of the success stories of the region, also gave a perspective on the region and the sector.\n\nThereafter, the delegates proceeded to ARM, where they participated in Cambridge Wireless's inaugural meeting of the Semiconductor Special Interest Group. This seminar, titled \"Entrance Strategies: Resourcing Early Stage Innovation', witnessed a host of high profile speakers, including Tudor Brown, President, ARM, who discussed and explored the challenges faced by early stage innovators, and shared experiences and success stories from industry leaders. Speakers also delivered valuable insights from potential funding sources.\n\nThe after session also gave a perfect networking platform for the ISA delegates to interact and understand the UK semicon companies. Later in the evening, the delegates travelled to Sidney Sussex College for a networking dinner. The EEI had arranged for the dinner at the last of the historic Cambridge University colleges, which dates back to 1596.\n\nA variety of representatives of the region's semiconductor and technology organisations and partners were present. David Riches, Chief Executive, EEI, Dr. Omkar Rai, Senior Director, STPI and Tudor Brown, President, ARM addressed the gathering during the dinner.\n\nOn day 5, The ISA delegation also travelled to the Semiconductor Physics Group and the Cambridge Centre for Advanced Photonics and Electronics (CAPE), both located at the West Cambridge site \u2014 an important part of the future development of the University as a whole.\n\nLater, the delegation travelled to St. John's Innovation Center, where they had lunch and final opportunity to meet local companies and contacts interested in developing a better understanding and relationship with the Indian semiconductor industry. This was hosted by the EEI.\n\nA round table was arranged to reflect on what had been learned during the program, and how to best capitalize on it in the short and longer term \u2013 both individually as companies and collectively as an industry.\n\nExcellent platform, overview for Indian companies The success of this delegation was summed up aptly by some of the members.\n\nOne member of the ISA delegation said: \"The ISA UK mission provided an excellent platform for India based semiconductor\/embedded design solution companies. We had a good overview on the UK's semiconductor industry, technology initiatives and research projects.\n\n\"On the business side, I am happy to say that we had good interactions with potential customers in the UK and we hope to move onto business engagements soon.\"\n\nAnother member felt that this was an excellent initiative to connect between India and the UK industries using platforms such as Silicon South West and East of England International. \"It also gave me an opportunity to meet with other companies from India and showcase what they had to offer,\" he added.\n\nThe meetings in Bath gave a perspective of what the UK industry has to offer regarding the semiconductor start-up companies and success stories. Also, the speakers and content of the Cambridge Wireless Semiconductor SIG was extremely well packaged. It provided insights into the business models successful Cambridge based semiconductor and fabless companies have followed.\n\nThe member further added: \"The TTP case study gave an example of how Cambridge University start-ups have created a value chain for innovation and promoting start-ups. Maybe, there is something for the Indian academia and the industry to learn from.\n\n\"I feel that there is an opportunity for the UK companies to exploit India as a 'new growth market' by collaborating with the Indian companies. Likewise, there is a potential for the Indian companies to raise the bar and help the UK companies to successfully innovate and be competitive in the global marketplace.\"\n\nOne other member added: \"The meetings at UK organized by the ISA and UKTI has been very successful event in creating a platform for setting up new relationship and exploring opportunities. Indeed, it is highly constructive step for mutual understanding and benefits. It provided opportunities to get insight into various UK companies and their ecosystem.\n\n\"I am confident it would help companies to build robust partnership complementing each other. I thank the ISA and UKTI for this effort; and their role as the technology and business enabler is highly appreciated.\"\n\nThe ISA delegation to the UK was led by Dr. Omkar Rai, Senior Director, Software Technology parks of India. Members of the delegation were represented from Chipwerks, CircuitSutra, CMC, KPIT Cummins, Smartplay Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services, Vayavya, Wipro and United Technologies Ltd.\n\nWednesday, October 7, 2009\n\nFor those who are unaware, during the middle of August, my original blog \u2014  \u2014 was suddenly found to be containing malware, and then, without any information, Google removed my blog. That was really devastating!\n\nNot knowing what to do, I quickly rolled out a fresh blog \u2013  \u2014 only to find out two days later that it also had malware, and subsequently, Google blocked it too!\n\nDespite mails and requests, nothing happened, and none of the two blogs were returned!\n\nIf this alone wasn't enough, five of my other blogs \u2014 on telecom, semiconductors, components, solar and electronics \u2014 were marked as spam blogs! All of this, within a space of one week, as though someone, somewhere was out to get me! Rather, remove me from cyberspace, so it seemed!\n\nIt was only then, that I moved everything to WordPress \u2014 and hence,  really came into being. It had been around since 2007, but I only re-activated it when I was literally forced to move my blogspot posts to wordpress.\n\nNot only did I lose traffic, there were lots of emails and messages from folks who were followers of my earlier blog!\n\nToday afternoon, after returning from meetings, I get a mail from Computer Weekly, UK, with this message:\n\nCongratulations, you've been nominated for an Award! You are now entered for a Computer Weekly Blog Award, under the category of IT Consultant and Analyst.\n\nI was also pointed to a link: \n\nThis is just the first stage on your way to winning. The awards will be judged by readers of Computer Weekly and users of ComputerWeekly.com, so start building up support right now \u2013 brag about your nomination on your site by downloading a Blog Awards badge onto your homepage.\n\nI tried adding the badge to WordPress, but for some reason it does not appear. So, I've added a jpeg image above.\n\nComputerweekly.com also left this message for me: Check out Computer Weekly and ComputerWeekly.com on 27th October to see if you've been shortlisted. Voting for shortlisted entries will open on 27th October.\n\nSave the date!\n\nAll shortlisted bloggers and tweeters will be invited to our Awards evening on 25th November 2009 at London's exclusive Shoreditch House. More details to follow in your shortlisted announcement.\n\nIrrespective of my blog getting shortlisted and whether I win this time or not, it is a relief to know that folks still like my blog.\n\nFriends, August 2009 was a testing month with my blogs either getting knocked out or blocked. Three great friends, particularly, Usha Prasad, Sagar Desai and Jo Kuo, along with my family, stood right by me at all times during those testing times!\n\nScott Weitzman left a lovely message, Poornima Shenoy gave me good advice, Sandesh Advani kept his faith me, as did Intel. Rahuldev Rajguru decided to wait and maintained his faith, as did Meghna Bhutoria, and lately, LK Pathak. The semiconductor and the solar\/PV industry stood by me, steadfastly, all this while!\n\nThere were good wishes from several others \u2014 the list is so long that they can't be all accommodated here.\n\nMy other blog \u2014  \u2014 was also eventually returned by Google, without the malware warning, this month.\n\nAll I can say is: thanks a lot, my dear friends and dear readers. Whether I get shortlisted or win \u2014 these things hardly matter! What matters to me is: I shall always have folks such as you to lean on during tough times. Thanks a lot, everyone.\n\nTuesday, October 6, 2009\n\nDuring a recent interaction with Intel IT, Hong Soo Ng, Malaysia Site IT Manager, Intel Technology Sdn. Bhd., highlighted the importance of investing in IT for competitiveness during the current economic time, while presenting an interesting lecture: Managing IT through downturn \u2013 business client perspective.\n\nHong Soo outlined the following:\n\n\u2022 Companies are looking to IT to improve competitiveness in the current environment. \u2022 IT opportunity to drive employee and business productivity \u2014 mobile and managed client refresh. \u2022 Mobile client refresh and remote management are key to reduced TCO of client machines.\n\nWe all know that 2009 has been a challenging year. Business spending is tight, but, IT can't sacrifice core services!\n\nThe challenge for IT has been the need for continued investment on innovation and enhancing capabilities.\n\nAccording to Gartner IT Key Metrics Data 2008, * 67 percent of IT spending is to keep the business running * 20 percent to enhance the existing capabilities * 13 percent used for innovation\n\nIT can make a difference by driving employee and business productivity, as well as continue IT efficiencies.\n\nLong-term consolidated IT strategy Hong Soo added that Intel moved through five stages in developing a long-term consolidated IT strategy. These include:\n\nMonday, October 5, 2009\n\nIt is well known that India already has the advantage of being a well established, low cost producer and assembler of solar PV cells and modules. It is also very likely that grid connected power would emerge as the major segment in India over the next few years, according to B.V. Naidu, chairman, India Semiconductor Association. He was speaking at the recently held 3rd Global Demand Conference in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nIndia currently has an installed manufacturing capacity of solar cells and modules of 400 MW and 700 MW, respectively, as per the ISA chairman.\n\nGiving an overview of the industry during 2007-08, Naidu added that India produced: * 110 MW of solar cells and 140 MW of modules. * Solar PV industry turnover was over $1.0 billion. * Ninety percent of the manufacturing capacity is currently exported. * The current grid connected capacity is less than 2 MW.\n\nPolicy initiatives from the government The government of India has announced several incentives for manufacturing. Manufacturing: 20-25 percent of incentive for solar PV.\n\nIncentives for grid connected applications: * Generation based incentives (GBI): $0.30 per unit. * Limited upto 50 MW from the government of India. * State governments are independently announcing their incentive programs.\n\nIncentives are also available for off-grid applications such as home lighting systems, street lighting systems and roof top systems. Next, there is an agenda to develop 60 cities as Solar Cities, aimed at reducing the energy consumption by 10 percent through energy lighting conservation and renewable energy. Also, the National Solar Mission aims at achieving a target of 20 GW of solar power by the year 2020.\n\nMarket opportunities in India All of these lead to the question: what are the kinds of market opportunities that exist in India?\n\nAccording to Naidu of ISA, India is already well established as a low cost producer and assembler of solar PV cells and modules. Also, it is a large market for DDG (Decentralised Distributed Generation) applications.\n\nNext, grid connected power would emerge the major segment, as India achieves grid parity. Also, the country boasts of a large pool of talented manpower, which can serve a good resource to develop applications suited to Indian market.\n\nThe benefits that will arise by the adoption of solar photovoltaics for India are immense. One, solar energy will help the country meet its energy security requirements, reduce dependence on exhaustible fossil fuel reserves and reduce the carbon footprint.\n\nIt will also help in providing remote\/rural villages faster access to electricity. Finallly, it will create several thousands of jobs -- both, direct and indirect -- in manufacturing, applications and R&D.\n\nISA's role Highlighting the role of the India Semiconductor Association (ISA) in demand promotion, Naidu added that it acts as an umbrella industry association for the solar PV companies in India. Also, the ISA enjoys a strong and credible working relationship with the key concerned ministries in the government of India, and advises it on policy initiatives for demand growth.\n\nFurther, the ISA has also made some bold recommendations on demand promotion in its comprehensive report on the sector carried out with government support, which have served as a useful reference for the government in policy formation. The ISA also organises industry events and delegation visits.\n\nThis was revealed by Malcolm Penn, Chairman & CEO, Future Horizons, while delivering the company's forecast at the ongoing 18th International Electronics Forum (IEF) 2009 in Geneva, Switzerland, which ends here tomorrow. \"He said, \"It's all about good management \u2026 only the bad times tell!\"\n\nSome of Penn's other forecast summaries include:\n\n* Economic recovery is said to have already started from 2H-2009. * Further '50 percent' cap ex reduction. * Memory price recovery 2H-2009. * Still lots of blood on the road near-term. * Strong will get stronger as weak go to the wall. * Watch for tight capacity starting 2H-2009. * Crisis is the time to implement change (brings out the best and worst). * R&D\/new products\/sound marketing will win (not counting pencils and scrapping the free coffee).\n\nOutlook for 2010 and beyond Penn also presented the company's outlook for the global semiconductor industry for 2010 and beyond. These include:\n\nAccording to Malcolm Penn, Future Horizons' 'Rose Glass' scenario came true! He said: \"We correctly forecast the pattern of the recovery. The rebound came one quarter earlier than expected.\" Given below is a snapshot of what's happened since the IFS2009 in January.\n\nIn January, the world was reeling from Q4's unprecedented collapse with December peppered with last minute Q4 downward guidance warnings. Everyone was affected \u2013 from Intel downward, the collapse was a total meltdown and completely across the board \u2013 covering all markets and regions.\n\nNext, there was absolutely zero visibility into the first quarter guidance. Many firms refused to even comment. Some said, \"We Simply Have No Idea!\" Others offered such a wide range of options that the guidance was meaningless"}
{"text":"Global cyber war treaties urgently needed: Bruce Schneier\n\nRules of engagement between different countries should be established before a major Web-based attack takes place according to BT Group's US chief security technology officer, Bruce Schneier.\n\nSpeaking at a BT briefing in Sydney, he said the world was in the early years of a cyber war arms race, something that's not in anyone's best interests.\n\n\"Unless this is stopped, we will see an increased militarisation of cyberspace and that affects the protocols and networks we use,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a doctrine called preparing the battlefield where countries will do things that aren't overtly offensive but prepare them for later on.\"\n\nAccording to Schneier, under that doctrine, both the United States and China had been penetrating each other's networks and leaving behind malicious pieces of code called logic bombs which could be used later.\n\n\"This is concerning because first off, the [logic bombs] can go off accidently and it crosses a line.\"\n\nTo prevent this from happening, Schneier called for cyber war treaties, similar to nuclear weapon treaties agreed to by countries such as the US and Russia, to be developed and signed.\n\n\"I'd like to see decisions about what cyber weapons we are building and using to be approved by the [US] president because there is too much chance of it getting out of hand,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Schneier, the Stuxnet worm which infected a nuclear facility in Iran during June 2009 was an example of how to create a highly targeted and well-written cyber weapon and it \"still went wrong\" as there were reports that it managed to escape the facility.\n\n\"It's been blamed for a satellite outage in India and an industrial plant in China which just happened to have a similar industrial control system,\" he said.\n\n\"Even if you target your weapons they can still have collateral damage in other countries.\"\n\nIn addition to the treaties, Schneier suggested countries establish rules of engagement in cyberspace and understand what he called cyber mercenaries and non-state actors, who range from terrorists to \"kids playing politics.\"\n\n\"Last year, the group Anonymous told the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation [NATO] not to mess with it. We're not supposed to be living in a world where a bunch of guys threaten NATO.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Schenier said that people also needed to stop feeding their own fears about cyber war.\n\n\"There is a lot of rhetoric out there because it's financially profitable and a lot of US companies are making good money out of cyber war contracts.\"\n\n\"This rhetoric ratchets up and just makes everything worse. The more we calm down and discuss this rationally, the more we can look at cyber war, the broader advanced persistent threat [APT] and how that affects usIn this white paper, we will look at how secure web gateways, one type of information security technology, can provide benefits to many departments within any business or government agency.

{"text":"from the might-be-a-bit-extreme dept\n\nA few years back, we asked if it should be illegal to get hacked. In that case, we were referring to some fines that the FTC had handed out to companies that had leaked data to hackers. This raised some troubling questions -- as it's often difficult-to-impossible to stop your computer systems from getting hacked, and putting liability on the company could lead to some serious unintended consequences. Yet, at the same time, over the past few years, we've heard about large security breaches on a regular basis (thanks, in large part, to new disclosure laws) -- and often those breaches definitely seem to be due to negligence on the part of a corporate IT team that failed to lock down the data in any significant manner. That seems to be leading more people down the path of saying that companies should be liable for getting hacked.\n\nFor example, Slashdot points us to a blog post at InfoWorld, where it's suggested that companies should be criminally liable for leaking such data. I can certainly understand the sentiment, but it may go too far. Again, it's impossible to totally protect a system from getting hacked. Sooner or later there's always going to be some sort of leak. Increasing penalties could make companies take things more seriously -- especially in cases of gross negligence (which do seem all too common). But making the rules too strict can have serious negative unintended consequences as well, even to the point that some companies may stop accepting credit cards altogether, since the liability would just be too great. Would people be willing to give up the convenience of credit cards to protect their safety? From what we've seen, for most users the answer would be no. They know their credit cards are at risk, but they still use them because the benefit of the convenience still seems to outweigh the danger of the risk"}

Firstly, the German Government has a degree of plausible deniability, in that there is no direct path from the victim to any law enforcement computer. Secondly, and much more interestingly, this gives US authorities easy access to all of the material.

The process demanded the use of ultra-expensive electron-scanning microscopes, with the team probing wafer-thin chips no bigger than a thumbnail. Each chip contained up to 50 layers, with each layer in turn carrying up to 1,000 transistors, every one of which had to be pulled apart and analysed.'.\" This is a follow-up to the Vivendi vs. News Corp. story with more details about what is alleged to have occurred. Update: 03\/14 12:28 GMT by M: And yet another story, which alleges that the head of security at NDS funded the website that distributed the hack for their rival's smart cards.\n\nNice paper... yet, the whole point is that a smart card is NOT a tamper resistant device. They might be worth their value as devices to store a public key in a `compact' form, but it has to be kept in mind that who has the device might have also the skills to recover its contents, either by breaking the algorithm or by tampering with the hardware. What a smart card usually lacks is a reilable self-destruct system when tampering (active or passive) is suspected. There are some designs which provide a\nself-destruct of the data by inducing an overcurrent in the memory cells; yet, this problem might be solved by just cutting the wires which should destroy the chip.\n\nAnd what are the signs the card is being tampered with? What happens if you accidentally put the card through the laundry? (Lots of water, tumbling, chemicals, heat, and static electricity) I could see a dumb smart card getting confused.\n\nSelf-destruct features could be rather interesting if true to corporate form: poorly planned and badly implemented. I'm already anticipating a 'joke' email going around with gads of stories of smartcards committing suicide at inopportune times. Not to mention slashdot stories about people who have managed to come up with a device capable of telling all smartcards within a 10 mile radius that they are being tampered with.\n\nI'm not thinking of the cost of replacing the cards. I'm thinking of the end-user. Does the 'smartcard' make it apparent that it has self destructed, or will the owner go to do something with it- be it take a trip to another country or buy dinner at a restaurant... Something where it is necessary to use the smartcard and discover that something has happened that caused the card to self-destruct leaving the person unable to make the trip as planned or pay for the dinner they have just consumed?\n\nAnd if the smartcard was being used solely for the purpose of establishing identity--such as a driver's license, are the police going to be understanding about \"Oh my god the dog must have bitten it!\" and won't it just open up a whole new can of worms where people are getting by security becuase their cards have self destructed and no one wants to second-guess them and deny them access?\n\nI'm just wondering if it's all that smart to have self-destructing methods of identification or payment. Unless the self destruction is made immediately apparent then it could be quite a flawed way of dealing with things.\n\nDMCA is about protecting copyrighted Intellectual Property. That generally means books, movies, music, etc. It isn't very likely that anything like this is being housed in a smart card as described in this article.\n\nGeneraly the DMCA refers to mass media stuff. Smart cards usually contain personal data or at least deployment-specific data, which is unique to the card.\n\nThe smart card is used to protect TV signals. Breaking it is akin to writing DeCSS.\n\nThough the DMCA wouldn't really apply because they didn't create a copy-prevention circumvention. They simply published the specs of the cards that many people already owned. Someone else designed the actual hacks. But when did little things like reason and logic ever affect politicians?\n\nWhat is a smart card? A credit card-sized device that protects digital television signals from unauthorised viewing.When plugged into a set-top box, it determines which programmes subscribers have paid to see.\n\nThe cards contain tiny but sophisticated computers that decrypt television signals as they pass through the air and turn them into television pictures. Without a smart card, ITV Digital viewers can only watch free-to-air channels like the BBC, ITV and Channels 4 and 5.\n\nUsers of pirate cards have been gaining access to pay TV channels like sports and movies without paying.\n\nWhere did the pirated cards come from?\n\nHackers posted on the internet details of the codes needed to create illegal smart cards that gave free access to pay TV services. Criminals used the information to make fake cards and then sold them through pubs, clubs and market stalls for \u00a35-\u00a320. About 100,000 pirated ITV Digital cards are thought to be in circulation.\n\nWhat is Vivendi Universal?\n\nA former French water group that is now one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world. The chief executive, Jean-Marie Messier (right), has become one of the world's most powerful media moguls after buying a range of businesses including the Universal film studios and music labels, Canal Plus television in France, the Cegetel mobile phone company, directory businesses and internet firms.\n\nWhat is Canal Plus?\n\nThe European film and television distribution arm of Vivendi Universal. The division that makes the smart cards is called Canal Plus Technologies. It supplies cards and software to 12.5m set-top boxes worldwide.\n\nWhat is NDS Group?\n\nBased in Staines, Middlesex, NDS specialises in building the smart cards and interactive software for pay TV systems that allows paid-for television programmes to be securely beamed to customers' homes.\n\nRupert Murdoch's News Corporation is an 80% shareholder. NDS technology is used in almost 28m pay TV set-top boxes worldwide and supports 40% of all satellite receivers. Most of the group's research is carried out in Israel.\n\nWrong.. the smartcard does no decryption of video. The smartcard in the H card is a 4mhz processor It does nothing but verification of authentication tokens and then tells the reciever to display correctly hotpornnet or to not display it correctly.\n\nThe smartcard is primarily used to store and decrypt the decoding key for the reciever.\n\nIf the video was being decoded in the card, then the card emulator hack that is used on the sucessful sattelite tv pirates systems wouldnt work as most use 286 and 386 machines that boot from a floppy.\n\nWhenever anything remotely like hacking occurs, the hacked company dramatically overstates all financial figures as well as the level of expertise required to perform the hack -- makes it seem more malicious. Damages always have at least 6 zeros (preferably 9) and you need to have a team of 15 people working 24\/7 for months\/years. When the truth is much closer to one person hacking away in a garage for a few weekends and finding a fundamental flaw. And damages? Well, with intellectual property it can often be argued that damages are negative, with the exposure being provided by a new technical option actually increasing the total number of people interested in spending money on a product.\n\nAnd finally a sample [wisc.edu] of the peer review that was avoided. A small quote:\n\nWe conclude that The Bell Curve is driven by advocacy for Herrnstein and Murray's vision, not by serious empirical analysis. America may or may not be on the way toward a custodial state. Policy interventions may or may not be effective. We know no more after studying The Bell Curve than we did before.\n\nCan one person have pulled of this crack, certainly . Did they work in a vacuum? Probably not, there is a cracking community and one would be a fool not to call the community knowledge in it. The idea of a corp. breaking a system that has had collectively hundreds of millions of dollars of R&D, and many many years invested into security for $5 million dollars (probably less) and 6 months is no less scary then a lone hacker, and to a security engineer probably more so. A lone cracker solves the problem almost randomly, and any particular cracker can not be relied upon to quickly crack a system. The idea that an org could fund this, and perhaps reliably crack the protection methods has far reaching consequences, and makes information warfare a realistic posibility.\n\nI'm going to take a wild guess here that you think of yourself as falling in the group of \"people with high IQs\", don't you? I'll bet you also think that IQ is an adequate proxy for intelligence. And I'll bet that while you read that old potboiler Messrs Murray and Herrnstein cobbled together, you've never read \"The Mismeasure of Man\". As for your excitable claims about chipcracking -- put up or shut up.\n\nWitches are real and evilly corrupt the souls of innocent people, (at the behest of satan). They can fly, and do vile infernal things to decent people.\n\nI even have ample sworn testimony to prove it. I am not offering one new idea.\n\nYet, I hope you don't believe that we should get out the stake and start burning witches. Because, Truth is not determined by citations either to a text (cough Google Bombing) or away from it (i.e. the well cited NASA Mooned America about the \"faking\" of the moon landings). Generally in academic circles truth is determined in part by peer review, and by time. The authors of the bell curve did not submit it for peer review, and was utterly destroyed, in peer reviewed jounals, in short order.\n\nGo read up on this book of yours. No source should be trusted without checking to see what others have thought of it.\n\nI'm sorry to have to say that the article you referred to contains a gross inaccuracy: the exstimate of the cost of `cracking a smart card' is way overinflated. Smart card technology is, by its own very nature, not safe: any smart card is vulnerable to power\/timing attacks and, even if expensive equipement helps, you don't need that much in order to recover the keys. As a matter of fact, given that amount of money the simplest way to force the system is an exaustive search on the 3des keyspace (yes, 3des is the algorithm). I would advise people to read a bit more about Differential Power Analysis before going to court... I would suggest anybody interested to try to find the proceedings of any {Euro|Asia}crypt or of CHES (Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded systems).\n\nLast time I checked, you can't just brute force 3des for $5 million - the keyspace is just too large (2^112 is pretty damn big). You'd need some help along the way, like the differential attacks described elsewhere. Wouldn't you?\n\nFrom what I've read, they cut down the keyspace by (for instance) forcing the algorithm to execute wrongly and thus revealing substantial information about the keys.\n\nAs a matter of fact, given that amount of\nmoney the simplest way to force the system is\nan exaustive search on the 3des keyspace (yes,\n3des is the algorithm)\n\nThis part makes me wonder if you're trolling. Well, if so, I bit. Searching the 3DES keyspace is not currently feasible, and won't be for quite some time. 3DES has an effective keyspace of ~111 bits (it's 112, but the complement property of DES keys, plus a number of weak keys reduce it by 1 bit and change). That's a keyspace that is 70,368,744,177,664 times larger than the 64-bit keyspace that distributed.net [distributed.net] has been working on for over three years, and 18,014,398,509,481,984 times larger than the one Deep Crack can search in a week. Actually, Deep Crack isn't really set up to attack 3DES (because it's infeasible and the EFF guys that build Deep Crack aren't stupid), but if it could, this means that finding a 3DES key would take, on average, 346,430,740,566,961 years. Of course, Deep Crack only cost $250K, and that was a couple of years ago, so more money and newer technology might be able to reduce that by a factor of 100 or so. Hell, assume you can do 1000 times better, Then you'd only need 346 trillion years.\n\n112-bit keys won't be safe forever, but they'll be safe for the next decade or two at the very least, barring the discovery of flaws in DES, which has successfully stood against all comers for nearly 30 years.\n\nRegarding power analysis, see my other post on why power analysis is dead [slashdot.org]. Timing analysis is similarly infeasible.\n\nAll that we have to go on is what is alleged to have occurred. It's too bad that such amazing feats, relevant as they are to all of our continuing efforts to secure our products and systems, cannot be directly described in more detail. Tell me again the ethical justification behind making code-breaking a legal issue?\n\nYou can build a hardware device called Season2 interface, which allows you to plug it into the decoder, and then plug the smartcard into the Season2. This device has a serial port conector, so you can connect it to the computer, and then \"sniff\" all the traffic between the cardAlso there are lots of emulation software you can program into some pics (16f84, 16f876) and build a smartcard (piccard, piccard2), so you are able to watch all channels for free with these cards.\n\nYes a season can be very helpful but you won't get the sufficient amout of information about the encryption algorithm just by sniffing the traffic between the smartcardHere in Sweden Canal Digital uses Conax and there are no public codes or files so that you can unscramble the picture. (There are pirate cards, but rumor says that they have been stolen from factory or are MOSCed (modified original cards) On the other hand the largest provider Viasat and their system is compleately cracked.\n\nBy expoliting or MOSCing the providers card you can read out the management keys (keys used for decrypting operational keys wich are used for decrypting the picture) and of course add other keys and idents. You can also change the time period that determines how long you are allowed to watch a channel. Right now there even are scripts that unlocks canal digital (conax) cards.\n\nis this the best they could come with to justify their losses ? Jean-Marie Messier (J2M) is just a stupid fool with hypertrophied ego.\n\nThe Universal music division made also a laugh of themselves by taking 5 years to release their music encryption scheme, which was cracked in 2 weeks, and had been overtaken by mp3s three years before. They did not understand that they could make money with mp3s (by merchandise, concerts, and stuff) and keep spending billions developing stupid encryptions, crashing web sites and harrassing highschool students trading mp3 CDs.\n\nCanal+ France was once a great channel, with all major blockbusters maybe 10 months old, great prOn, soccer, and excellent humor and hosts. Nowadays they show less than half of the good movies of the year before, most of them being actually 18\/24 months old (because they have to go through their lameass pay per view channels first), run old TV movies, have lost many of their young talents, audience has plumetted to 1 % marketshare, prices went up (some say that in the 80s coke was free for everyone at their parties, now even the prices of the other kind of coke at the vending machines have gone up).\n\nEven if it didn't take place as they claim, this would certainly be a working strategy: crack your competitions technology, release it anonymously on the net in an easy-to-use form and let the script-kiddies do the rest. I guess we'll be seeing more of that tech\/cyberwar in the future.\n\nIs this the best they could come with to justify\ntheir losses ? Jean-Marie Messier (J2M) is just a stupid fool with hypertrophied ego.\n\nI wouldn't know, I don't know him, but this comment is about his person, not the issue at hand. I.e. not only off-topic, but a flame\/troll also.\n\nNowadays they show less than half of the\ngood movies of the year before, most of them\nbeing actually 18\/24 months old (because they\nhave to go through their lameass pay per view channels first),\n\nBut mostly because of the law that prohibits public broadcasting of movies, within one year of them beeing show in theaters.\n\n(some say that in the 80s coke was free\nfor everyone at their parties, now even\nthe prices of the other kind of coke at the\nvending machines have gone up).\n\nThere is nothing in your comment that is on-topic, all of it is off-topic, quite a bit is trolling material. and some personal comments about someone beeing \"a stupid fool\". Are you running some kind of a smear-campaign ?\n\nAnd they blame it on Murdoch and the Israelies !\n\nNobody is blaming \"the Israelis\" as a whole. Af course there are morally-challenged Israelis as there are of any other nationality. But it's not a comment about all Israelis.\nIsrael has got very good cryptographers and I think that is the reason the article mentions the alleged location of the crack.\n\nI think the interesting part is this just shows with enough big dollar corporate investment, even sophisticated security schemes can be cracked.\n\nIf cracking security helps your competition out of business, well, that could be worth several billion dollars. Investing $100 million would be money well spent.\n\nIn my community, the hacker community, a goal is to IMPROVE security by revealing it's flaws. But these guys broke security to make billions off of someone else's huge investment. That's very different.\n\nOf course, like Enron, corporate executives should pay the price for much of the resulting destruction. It'd say that a good \"20 years to life\" sentence would be appropriate for all of those in this management chain. And if the worker-bees knew what they were up to, same thing: jail.\n\nTrue - but I'm not so sure their goal was to \"make billions off someone else's huge investment\". If what Vivendi is claiming is true, the aim was (a) to undermine a rival technology (if Vivendi's smartcard was totally cracked then no other TV operaters would buy it), and (b) to cause pay-per-view rivals that used Vivendi's technology to lose money through widespread cracking - losing subscriber payments and having to spend more on counter-measures.\n\nIt must be remembered that the smoking gun could be this: NDS is 80% owned by News International. News International owns BSkyB pay-per-view sat network, which competes against Canal+ and, more directly, ITV Digital in the UK.\n\nIn my community, the hacker community, a goal is to IMPROVE security by revealing it's flaws. But these guys broke security to make billions off of someone else's huge investment. That's very different [and they should be jailed for 20 years to life]\n\nWhoa there just a second. Before we all start cheering \"You go, geek!\", let's analyse what you've just said.\n\nIt's OK for you to crack encryption and to disclose it - responsibly, I'm sure you'll claim, but you'll have to pick your own definition for what that actually means - because your intention is to help the creators improve it.\n\nIt's 20 years to life for an NDS employee to perform substantially similar actions, simply because their intention is different.\n\nYou probably reckon that if you ever screw up a disclosure (information wants to be free, right?), and information gets into the wild that helps commercial pirates to sell cracked cards, then it's a no-foul simply because you're one of the good guys. In that case the damages to rights owners is just an unfortunate accident, it wasn't your fault, it was that 1337_h4x0r guy you'd known for three whole weeks on IRC, who promised he was a white hat and that you could trust him with the disclosure, and so on.\n\nI can understand your stance, but I'd suggest that in practical terms that any disclosures you make will be judged (prosecuted, rather) on the consequences, and that you'll have to rely on your good intentions purely as a last ditch defence, and not as a cloak of invulnerability. I'd be very careful about wishing for long sentences for black hats, because I suspect that a jury might be rather less inclined to believe a plea of \"I never meant to hurt anyone\" from someone that the prosecution has just described as an evil computer hacker with a track record of hiding behind anonymous pseudonyms (\"standards\") to cover up his nefarious acts.\n\nIn other words: don't be too sure that something as fragile as the truth will protect you. Lawyers get paid a lot of money to lie very convincingly on behalf of their clients. How convincing could you be if you ever have to prove your innocence?\n\nI think the interesting part is this just shows with enough big dollar corporate investment, even sophisticated security schemes can be cracked.\n\nDo you have any reliable information on the actual investment required for the crack other Vivendi's statement? The nature of the security business is that the crackers don't break systems the way their designers expect - they bypass mechanisms instead of attacking them directly, they cheat, they are creative.\n\nThe numbers cited by Vivendi represent the resources required for a group of well-funded but imagination-impaired engineers to break the system. I find it hard to believe that whoever did this (whether or not it was really NDS) actually spent that much money.\n\nI think the interesting part is this just shows with enough big dollar corporate investment, even sophisticated security schemes can be cracked.\n\nYes, they can, but it should also be pointed out that this one wasn't very sophisticated in the ways that count. I design smart card security systems for a living, and these guys broke a cardinal rule: \"Never assumer that the cards are invulnerable -- because they aren't!\" In fact, no security device is invulnerable. Like a good safe, a security device provides an obstacle that can be overcome with time and effort (although the bar is much higher for the best smart cards than for the best safes). So, any well-designed system should have mechanisms in place to ensure that the break of one card does not compromise the whole system, and to ensure that the cost of breaking one card (around $300K for the best cards, not $5M, and less for older cards). Designers of physical security systems utilize the same principle, although in a different way. Safes are surrounded by alarms, cameras and guards whereas cards are (must be) placed in the hands of potential attackers. The point is, a good design takes into account the strengths and the limitations of the technology and plans accordingly.\n\nI'm so sick of this. I mean, I can understand why they do it but I'm still sick of it. All the way to the bone.\n\nThere was a time when companies could ask for money and then have something delivered to it's customers. Soon, this practise became standard all over the world and lots of people payed for things like TV and Radio. All non-physical in it's form, but yet valued highly enough for the consumers to spend their cash on it.\nThen, came Computers and later the Internet. Suddenly, everything that could be put into a digital form and transported over the Internet was free for the taking. Consumers didnt have to pay for content anymore, all the non-physical things they previously payed for didnt cost a dime anymore. Of course, all companies scrambled to try to get old laws and rules to apply to the new world but it was pointless. Everything in a digital form was free, and there was nothing to be done about that.\n\nLong story short; if it's in a digital form (tv,radio,mp3,movies) it's free, and if it's physical (food,cinema,concerts,cars) it costs. that's how the future's going to be, you cant expect people to pay and then not get to keep it or lay their hands on it anymore - 'cos it's free. we are greedy by nature, and here I see yet another company kicking wildly on it's way down when it's marketing idea of selling nothing to people is starting to rumble, because it got too greedy. better place all that money on trying to embrace the new digital world than locking it out.\n\nThere was a time when companies could ask for money and then have something delivered to it's customers.\nSoon, this practise became standard all over the world and lots of people payed for things like TV and Radio. All non-physical in it's form, but yet valued highly enough for the consumers to spend their cash on it.\n\nExcept for the consumers who chose not to pay, and instead pirated the signals. People have been cracking PayTV mechanisms and distributing hardware 'free TV' solutions for decades.\n\nThe Internet did not 'cause' the consumer to start buying hack hardware for the pay services, it just accelerates the process and makes it easier for consumers to find the piracy hardware and purchase it without having to deal with their local mafia franchisee.\n\nWhat people fail to look at is the income being generated by these companies. Most people \"hacking\" DirecTV are still subscribing to it! The cheapest package they'll sell someone is $21.99 per month (going up to $24.99 per month next month!) - and hackers need to pay for this so their unique encrypted key won't get \"blacklisted\", effectively locking them out of using an \"emulator\" to get all the channels.\n\nAs I keep saying about these intellectual property issues; you as an individual or business always have the right to *attempt* to protect your IP from piracy\/duplication. If, however, you fail to do so - I think that should be considered your loss, and not something worthy of tying up the legal system.\n\nThe Guardian is a UK newspaper not owned by News Corp. and with no great love of them..\n\nSo keep this in mind when reading this that there will be a 'Lets take the piss out of NewsCorp' slant to this, since Newspapers gently dissing each other is par for the course (certainly in the UK, and I don't see it being different elsewhere).\n\nHaving said that, I actually Read the Guardian site almost every day, It's my favorite UK newspaper (because it has a gentle socialist bias), but I take everything I read, everywhere, with a pinch of salt. I always try to remember the source since it always alters the presentation of 'facts' and often which 'facts' get presented in the first place..\n\na) Leaking the card owners details does not compromise the system for other users.\n\nb) Plugging the card into a reader does not immediately compromise the owners security. e.g. authentication is used with the remote client [and the reader acts as a relay or proxy].\n\nTrying to prevent people from tearing it apart and looking at the guts is just stupid and counter-productive. The more important side channels are timing and power, not preventing people with electron microscopes...\n\nFor example, with a bogus reader even if a) and b) hold true, it could be that a timing attack reveal clues about the secret keys used.\n\nCanal+ has a very long history of crackers kicking the living daylights out of their encryption\/scrambling schemes.\n\nWhen the channel was launched in the early '80s, it took less than two months for the electronic schematics of a \"pirate\" descrambler to be posted in a popular electronics magazine... who quickly pulled the issue from the shelves when sued by Canal+. It's been downhill ever since.\n\nI seriously doubt the company attacked by Canal+ had to spend millions and millions of $$$ to crack the scrambling -- the figure (as well as Canal+ losses) were probably grossly over-inflated by greedy lawyers and C+ legal department.\n\nOne final note: Canal+ has a nasty reputation in France and in the rest of Europe for cracking down hard on pirates & crackers. Jean-Marie Messier (CEO of Vivendi\/Universal\/Canal +), who is a complete megalomaniac, is probably to prove he has got a bigger... Uh... large... Ahem... hairy cojones than News Corps's CEO.\n\nIf you can't guess it, brute force it. If you can't brute force it, hand the best team you have a blank check and say, \"Enjoy.\"\n\nOne of the interesting things I saw recently at the NSA career website was a mention that many of their engineers get their own, individual, custom hardware. If they have the budget and facilities for that, you better believe that they have what NDS has and more.\n\nThe iButton's tamper resistance is not perfect - at least according to Ross Anderson, in \"Security Engineering\" (Chapter 14, \"Physical Tamper Resistance\"):-\n\n... one might try drilling in through the side, then either probe the device in operation or disable the tamper-sensing circuitry. Because the iButton has lid switches to detect the can being opened, and its processor is mounted upside-down on the circuitboard (with a mesh in the top metal layer of the chip), this is unlikely to be a trivial exercise. It might well involve building custom jigs and tools. In short, it's a tempting target for the next bright graduate student who wants to win their spurs as a hardware hacker.\n\ni.e. the \"no-tamper technology\" in the iButton is in the form of lid switches which may be defeatable by drilling in from the side, unlike e.g. the IBM 4758 cryptoprocessor which has a tamper-sensing mesh encasing it.\n\nThere are two fundamental problems with Internet transactions -especially those that involve sensitive information: authentication and secure transmission. More simply, nobody really knows who you are. Just by eavesdropping, someone can gain information about you and steal your identity. Enter the cryptographic iButton, a very personal computer in a 16mm, stainless steel case. It provides for secure end-to-end Internet transactions-including granting conditional access to Web pages, signing documents, encrypting sensitive files, securing email and conducting financial transactions safely-even if the client computer, software and communication links are not trustworthy. When PC software and hardware are hacked, information remains safe in the physically secure iButton chip.\n\nMaking Life More Convenient and Secure A physically secure co-processor to a terminal, PC, workstation, or server, the crypto iButton opens up a whole new world of convenience. It connects to the 250 million existing computers with a $15 Blue Dot receptor. By simply pressing your Blue Dot with your iButton, you can:\n\nBe granted access privileges to sensitive information on a conditionally accessed Web page using PKI challenge\/response authentication. Sign documents so the recipient can be certain of their origin. For example, you can write and sign an expense report. Or you can author a newspaper story, sign it at your vacation home and email it to the publisher. Encrypt and decrypt messages, securing email for the intended eyes only. Conduct hassle-free monetary transactions-print your own electronic postage stamps or print, write, and sign your own electronic checks (coming soon to the network economy). A Portable, Wearable Computer This mobile computer can become even more secure. You can keep the crypto iButton with you wherever you go by wearing it as a closely guarded accessory-a watch, a key chain, a wallet, a ring-something you've spent your entire life practicing how not to lose. Here are a few reasons why you might want to wear the crypto iButton on the accessory that best fits your lifestyle:\n\nIt's a safe place to keep the private keys you need to conduct transactions. It overcomes the deficiencies of secret passwords. You eliminate keystrokes with a quick, intentional press of the Blue Dot. You keep your computer at hand versus lugging yours everywhere you roam. You become part of the network economy. This steel-bound credential stands up to the hard knocks of everyday wear, including sessions in the swimming pool or clothes washer.\n\nAn array of digital jewelry has already been established for the convenience of wearing your iButton credential at the iButton store.\n\nThe Crypto iButton's Extraordinary Security You don't have to take our word for how secure this crypto iButton really is. The National Institute of Standards (NIST) and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) have validated a version of the crypto iButton for protection of sensitive, unclassified information. FIPS 140-1 validation assures government agencies that the products provide a trusted, physically secure module to properly protect secure information.\n\nAs a starting point for the iButton's extraordinary security, the stainless steel case of the device provides clear visual evidence of tampering. The monolithic chip includes up to 134K of SRAM that is specially designed so that it will rapidly erase its contents as a tamper response to an intrusion. Rapid erasing of the SRAM memory is known as zeroization. Any attempts to uncover the private keys within the SRAM are thwarted because attackers have to both penetrate the iButton's barriers and read its contents in less than the time it takes to erase its private keys.\n\nSpecific intrusions that result in zeroization include:\n\nOpening the case Removing the chip's metallurgically bonded substrate barricade Micro-probing the chip Subjecting the chip to temperature extremes In addition, if excessive voltage is encountered, the sole I\/O pin is designed to fuse and render the chip inoperable.\n\nI don't dispute that iButton's are more secure than smartcards, but there is still more scope to break into the iButton than a fully tamper resistant device (the IBM 4758, for example).\n\nYou don't have to take our word for how secure this crypto iButton really is. The National Institute of Standards (NIST) and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) have validated a version of the crypto iButton for protection of sensitive, unclassified information. FIPS 140-1 validation assures government agencies that the products provide a trusted, physically secure module to properly protect secure information.\n\nFIPS 140-1 classification doesn't necessarily imply tamper resistance. It sets out 4 levels, with level 4 being the highest. At time of printing of my source doc (Ross Anderson's \"Security Engineering\", published 2001) there was only one level 4 device (IBM 4758 - the crypto unit used in e.g. ATM machines). The iButton falls officially into class 3 in FIPS 140-1, but in fact exceeds level three by some way. (Level 3 only requires potting of the components which doesn't rule out any scraping, sandblasting, drilling, EM leakage or memory remanance attacks etc.). FIPS 140-2 (which supercedes 140-1) is available online here [nist.gov] .\n\nThe iButton falls into an area commonly known as level 3.5 and attacking it would be difficult, but not to the level of difficulty of a 4758 or similar device.\n\nI would be particularly curious of how the iButton intends to detect \"Micro-probing the chip\" in order to trigger zeroisation. If this is purely based on the mesh layer in the chip then a sophisticated attacker using the \"drill through the side\" approach may be able to bypass this since the tamper resistant layer doesn't completely enclose the chip.\n\nNot easy by any means, and certainly orders of magnitude better than a smart card, but it doesn't warrant the \"You CANT do this to an iButton\" position!\n\nIn fact, the IBM 4758, (or rather the CCA software supplied with it) can be cracked under certain privileged access conditions as demonstrated by a team [slashdot.org] in Anderson's group in Cambridge.\n\nCould be. But a cracker with a serious budget would use a hermetically sealed chamber filled with nitrogen (if the sensors are oxygen sensors) or the right pressure (if the sensors are pressure sensors), thereby avoiding the sensors tripping.\n\nUsing Focused Ion Beam technology, it is a simple matter to carve away pieces of the container and leave behind the parts that operate the switches. When that is done, the switches can be disconnected. A FIB mill is able to mill cuts smaller than a micron. I know as I use one at work in R&D in a chip plant. We take apart chips all the time to get critical dimension measurements and diagnose failures under several layers of the chip. One new chip had a design flaw where a VIA was where it was not supposed to be. This shorted the chip so it couldn't be probbed to check the health of the rest of the chip. The engineering data was saved by using a FIB to etch a circle around the VIA disconnecting that one connection. This saved much R&D time as we didn't need to get a new reticle fixing only one problem. The next reticle had the shorted VIA fix as well as many other changes based on the probed data of the chip. Disconnecting the tamper switch circuit that would erease a chip would be a trivial task.\n\nI agree with you that the form factor of an iButton gives it the potential to be more secure than a smart card, even if both use basically the same technology for the chip itself. In fact I would even say that the this is an ideal application for the form factor of the iButton.\n\nI will warn you though, that having iButtons placed in satellite TV decoders might be the worst thing that could ever happen to a good product.\n\nAs has been pointed out many times here, the problem with these encrypted TV schemes is that they seem to depend on all the cards having the same key. Please correct me if I am wrong. In a well designed smart card system all the cards have card unique keys, which means that if you go through the time and expense of cracking one card then you have one card cracked. This makes it so nobody even wants to crack a card because there is a limited amount of harm that you can do with one cracked card.\n\nSince encrypted TV requires all the cards to have the same keys, cracking one card means that the entire system is cracked. You can pump out as many cards as you like. This means that there is actually incentive to crack the card, since you can do exactly what the culprits here did.\n\nWhat is the point of all this? You can bet that if an iButton were used instead of a smart card that eventually a single iButton would be cracked. Even if it takes millions of dollars to crack a single one, it would be done. Then the iButton would be in the same boat as smart cards are in here on\/. and in other circles, which is that everybody thinks they aren't secure because of the encrypted TV problem. What they don't realize is that the encrypted TV problem in inherently insecure using current protcols. It wouldn't be the fault of the iButton any more than the current situation is the fault of the smart card industry. It is simply that the problem is hard.\n\nMaybe they could make a \"Super iButton\" that could be larger, have its own internal power source and a nifty mesh like the IBM 4758. They would become more expensive and you'd have to toss them when the battery runs out, but that might work better.\n\nthis is the whole point.. WHY does there have to be a smartcard for a sattelite reciever in the first place? they can make all this work on the mainboard tying the reciever to the owner\/viewer. and it creates awesome abilities to completely thwart or slow down hugely the pirate tv viewers.. Most home sattelite pirates will gladly plug in a hacked H card, they will not take the time to try and remove epoxy from a mainboard, modify a circuit, solder in parts, etc...\n\nit is silly to have any kind of plug-in authentication system on such devices..\n\nWHY does there have to be a smartcard for a sattelite reciever in the first place?\n\nI agree, a smart card seems like it is only there because it is easy to replace. This would enable the companies to mail out new cards periodically and have cutomers install them with very little hassle. If you want the entire device to last longer than say, five years you would need to either have something more secure than a smart card or be able to replace the card at will. But there are disadavantages to using a smart card in this system. I believe that the iButton is probably not much better and nearly as hackable. You probably disagree, but you didn't address that point. If there is large corporation that would like to hack the iButton simple to destroy a competitor's product as was the case here then I can't imagine it holding. Again, you are free to correct me, and I admit that you know a lot more about iButtons than I do.\n\n\/. user swillden and I have been discussing whether there is any good solution to this problem. I won't post all our thoughts here. One component of a more secure system would be a crypto unit that actively monitors its own state. It would be interesting to know how much this would cost. The IBM 4758 costs about $2,000, so it is not an option, but you wouldn't need all that functionality. Also, economies of scale would kick in so you could make a simplified device for not that much money.\n\nThe real question is how much money are the satellite TV companies REALLY losing (as opposed to perceived loss) and how much would a more secure system be worth to them?\n\nactually for sattelite TV I wouldn't reccomend an iButton for sattelite tv reciever. I would reccomend a custom processor and a fpga replacement of the \"card\" is no longer necessary as they can easily send firware updates over the sattelite link. plus, having the box call home with an encrypted rolling key and protocol nightly to just report checksums and other information would cut the supposed losses due to piracy at least in half. They keep throwing high-technology at the problem where making it inconvienent to anyone but an electronics engineer would make a significant dent... you could also embed on each machine an ibutton cousin... the serial number chip that looks like a surface mount transistor.... as another checksum.... granted someone with a 16f84 pic can emulate anything like that easily, but that would again require someone to either do alot of modification work themselves or buy a hacked box for a ton of money and then worry that the thing might die (no warrenty) or it might rat on them by calling home when the software was updated last night by the sattelite company.\n\nI personally believe that cince they are not changing how their system operates, they are really not noticing any profit loss from piracy.. (same as cable tv)\n\nThe Guardian's got two more pieces on this today, with more details about the collusion between NDS and \"crackers\", including the very seedy past of the NDS security chief Ray Adams. The guts of it are the connections of NDS with a sat-piracy website called The House of Ill Compute (THoIC), which fell apart in spectacular fashion in the middle of last year when some of the site's members confronted the spy in their midst in a pub with evidence he was recording everything and passing it to NDS, and getting paid for it. Some UK\/.ers may recall it.\n\nThe question is was the smart card a 0.40 euro or a 10 euro one. There are smartcards that:\n\nContain selfdestruct chemicals that immediately destroy chips core when opened (and they are pretty effective).\n\nPerform logical operations on complementary values at the same time (first order differential power analysis wont work).\n\nHave several polished layers of transistors( so you cant see the connection layout without carefully removing layers).\n\nHave encrypted internal bus(so you cant read single bits from the bus, becouse they depend on each other).\n\nAre designed to resist power failures (can't make that jump to crypto routine to become nop by dropping power or clock)\n\nGenerally are designed by paranoid and smart people.\nCracking such cards is not possible in a garage according to public research. However, any smartcard can be hacked with enough determination and the correct solution is to make sure that hacking of one card only compromises that one card and not the entire system. However I don't think that limiting compromise is possible in broadcasting environment.\n\nTo obliterate a chip, it doesn't need to be very much. A tiny layer spread thinly across it, inert until exposed to oxygen (I'd presume that's the method, although it could simply be a fragile casing if they don't mind false failures) would do the trick, and not even begin to irritate the skin if smeared on you.\n\nContain selfdestruct chemicals that immediately destroy chips core when opened (and they are pretty effective).\n\nVery cool. Can you point out any specific chips? I'm not familiar with any that have this feature.\n\nPerform logical operations on complementary values at the same time (first order differential power analysis wont work).\n\nNote that Kocher has described ways of defeating the complementary operations approach. It's based on the fact that because the set of transistors performing the complementary operations are not exactly the same as those performing the \"correct\" operations, it's possible to distinguish between them. But, yes, there are a variety of ways to defeat DPA and symmetric cryptography modern cards is not vulnerable to DPA (PK operations are still quite vulnerable, AFAIK).\n\nHave several polished layers of transistors( so you cant see the connection layout without carefully removing layers).\n\nAbsolutely. And the layering is also structured to try to place more sensitive data near the center of the stack.\n\nHave encrypted internal bus(so you cant read single bits from the bus, becouse they depend on each other).\n\nThe Dallas chips did this, but they were broken. Are there others?\n\nAre designed to resist power failures (can't make that jump to crypto routine to become nop by dropping power or clock).\n\nYep, and you should also mention that they monitor other environmental factors like temperature levels, because attacks have been devised that exploit freezing chips or overheating them.\n\nGenerally are designed by paranoid and smart people.\n\nAnd this is the best point in your post. Smart card chips are designed by smart, paranoid people who also try to break them and study the attacks that do succeed so they can build countermeasures to those attacks in the next round.\n\nSecurity is a constant cat and mouse game, with better and better attacks leading to better and better defenses. In the smart card world, the defenses have already progressed far beyond the stage where attacks you can perform in your garage are likely to be successful. Then again, there are plenty of smart card systems being designed and fielded by clueless idiots, so we'll be sure to see plenty more \"Smart cards hacked!\" stories on\/.\n\nHowever, any smartcard can be hacked with enough determination and the correct solution is to make sure that hacking of one card only compromises that one card and not the entire system.\n\nHear, hear. I've employed many paragraphs to make the same point. But I've never been accused of being overly concise;-)\n\nHowever I don't think that limiting compromise is possible in broadcasting environment.\n\nSame signal to all consumers -> same decoding keys for every consumer -> all decoding cards are identical in critical ways. Yeah, seems like an intractable problem.\n\nIt's long been \"common knowledge\" (eg, possible fallacy that everyone holds to be true) that Canal+'s encryption was broken because European hackers wanted free access to the porn that's encrypted using it.\n\nSky's encryption however didn't shelter any porn and was therefore not worth the effort.\n\nAmusingly enough, AFAIK, one of the major victims of this (ITV Digital in the UK) took on the encryption AFTER it had been publicly cracked.\n\nI spent a few months cracking ARM 60 CPUs and seeing if I could find the key kept in the memory by observing the power consumption. Using a fast storage scope I could simply hook onto sequences in the program (branches are easily visible) and find the operations on the key. The power measurements told me how many bits in the key were on or off when driving the ALU read bus. As the algorithm was working with bytes it was very easy to find most of the bits of information. From a 32bit (4 billion combinations) key I could get down to about 2000 possibilities. From there its easy to just try them all out. Synchronous processors were very simple to crack. Asynchronous processors didn't have easily visible features like the clock to find the key instructions. They also have temporal shifts so different runs have the instructions executing at different times dependant on the data. From an asynchronous Amulet2e I could only get two or three bits of information (down to 1 billion possibilities).\n\nIn other posts (they may have been in the other\/. story posted earlier) I read comments that in effect said that people were hypocritical if they supported posting DeCSS code and not the code that decrypts Canal+'s system. If in fact the reason people are drawing a distinction between the 2 because one scheme was cracked by an individual person and the other by a global corporation with millions of $ to pump into R&D, then I agree, that distinction is hypocritical. However, there is a principled distinction that can be drawn between the 2 based on intent.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Murdoch's company released the information with the intent that others would use the information to steal proprietary information (the video streams) from Murdoch's competitors. That is MUCH different than cracking a scheme for the sake of the knowledge itself or merely to see if it can be done.\n\nThe former case is analogous to the following: Employee has combination to Boss' safe where all company assets are kept. Employee and Boss have an antagonistic relationship. Employee publishes an ad in \"Robbers Daily News\" with the address of the business and safe combination knowing (or hoping with a high probability that his hope will come true) that Robber reading the RDN will use the combination and steal the assets. Robber actually does use and steal. Employee is part of a conspiracy to steal the company's assets and is guilty of the theft as much as Robber. Don't say that my scenario is not accurate - I assure you as a lawyer that under this hypothetical situation, Employee is a conspirator.\n\nAlso, don't say that trying to look at the subjective intent of the actors kcreates an unworkable situation because WE DO IT EVERY DAY. In courts all across this and other countries around the world, we use the intent of the actor to determine the guilt of people for crimes (or to determine levels of guilt) or liability for civil offenses. Example: Man runs Woman over with car. Did Man intend to kill woman? If yes == murder. If no == somehting else. Did Man drive recklessly such that his actions constituted a depraved indifference to human life. If yes == murder or homocide. If no == something else. Was Man driving carelessly? If yes == involuntary manslaughter or negligent homocide. If no == something else. Was Man driving according to all posted rules and carefully? If yes == accident, no intent (or substitute for intent like recklessness), therefore NOT GUILTY.\n\nAlthough it is more work looking at subjective intent, it usually provides a more thorough examination of the situation and an individualized solution. Simple, bright line rules just do not work well in complex situations. Case in point: the DMCA.\n\nAlthough I agree it is easy to draw a line between legitimate and illegitimate uses in this instance, I usually stop short of labeling a technological endeavor itself as having no legitimate purposes. For example, if a startup company wanted to manufacture a compatible smartcard to compete in sales of that hardware, they would find that most likely the current manufacturer has some sort of legal protection for its design. If that protection is a patent, the patent would actually have to teach you how to make the smartcard (or at least the patented features of the smartcard). If however, the current manufacturer is relying on keeping its design a trade secret, then efforts to crack the smartcard could be a legitimate reverse engineering effort to allow entry into the smartcard market.\n\nNintendo lost a case like that a few years ago when it claimed that video game manufacturers had to license its hardware interface design for game cartridges. The court held that competing game manufacturers could reverse engineer the hardware for the purpose of being able to enter the marketplace for Nintendo game cartridges. That is the weakness with trade secrets - once someone discovers the secret (legitimately, of course) your protection is gone.\n\nPerhaps someone could fill me in as to why the suit was filed in a California court. From what I read in the article, the alleged hacking occurred in Israel, and the damaged business are in Europe. I do not see how California law could have jurisdiction in this matter.\n\nSmartcards for the general market have to be robust enough and low power enough that they are smallish CPUs. The fast ones are 8Mhz and have some crypto functions built in. In raw CPU terms they are about the same level as a fast Z80.\n\nIn a cable TV system, the smart cards generate a seed that is feed to crypto unit. Most system gave up on the smart cards that just say \"they get channles 2-20,45,Pr0n...\" since they were cracked within days but you never know when a 20 year old cable system is still in use. The Foxtel system in Australia for example uses a signal down the wire that goes to the smart card which then generates a pseudo random sequence. Each of thouse numbers is like an index that tells it where the line is swaped. Their encryption is they take each scanline, break it and send the second part first. Someone in Norway(?) had written a program that would look for the split in real time and put it back together. I guess Murdoch might have something to worry about if the rumor is true and someone else is willing to pay for a crack.\n\nModern credit card systems do the ATM pin hiding trick in the smart card. If you have access to the networks used by a large department store, it would take about a year to crack most repeat customer's pin numbers. Since most pin numbers are only 4 digits, you only need to be able to feed the chip a few wrong tries per \"swipe\" and if they come in a few times a week, you could try 500 pin codes in a year. If you do that with 20 different cards a week, you will have someones full account details and their pin number in a year. Since its automated, there is no use to limit yourself to 20. This works for both Visa and that cool new clear card from that company no one will accept.\n\nSo in a smartcard based credit card system, All you accounts are belong to us.\n\nI was thinking, if these satellite companies implement their smart cards using Java Cards [sun.com] (which are themselves dynamically reprogramable by nature), couldn't they deal better with these issues???\n\nWhen something like this happens (i.e.: the code is broken), all the satellite operator has to do is send new code to the setup box which will write it on the card, then the code in the card is used to decode the incoming broadcast.\n\nIt's like assigning the card a new set of keys in a public-private cryptographic key.\n\nHOWEVER, I think this will never be solved until satellite operators can do two-way communications with the setup boxes themselves. Who knows, maybe in the future satellite operators will require users to connect to the Internet at least once a month to update the software of the smart cards, thus giving them enough time for the new codes to be deployed far and wide. Heck, I'd actually have new codes daily!!!\n\nFor those into techno-religious wars, I used Java Cards as an example, as opposed to other types of smart cards, because Java gives a unified API and object-based execution environment for ALL cards regardless of their origin, which is exactly what's needed to help this situation out.\n\nthough it's harder these days - few chips have 1000s of transistors anymore, more like millions. I remember people reverse engineering the original VGA chips looking for hidden registers), low tech pattern matching (hire a bunch of students over the summer and have them go over photo-micrographs). However things are made easier if you can figure out the cells in the library they built the thing from - then you just pattern match gates.\n\nROMs are also probably pretty easy to decode (unless you compiled them thru your synthesis tool).\n\nSmart cards are probably much harder - I bet they're built to be hard to crack (lots of nasty stuff over the top of things so you have to peel them apart to find the metal\/poly layers\n\nIn this case I doubt anyone knows what happened (unless someone inside NDS squealed) - I suspect much of this is just so much guess work\n\nI have a small indoor antenna with an electronic booster (we're not allowed to put up an outdoor antenna in my building), and while the signal isn't perfect if the weather is bad, we do get all the channels.\n\nThere are many reasons why ITV Digital isn't doing so well, but it's not all their fault. Firstly, they have a financial disadvantage: not only are they a much smaller company than Sky, but they mustpay huge license fees to the government for the priveledge of existing. Sky, being based off shore, pays no such fees, as they are effectively outside regulation.\n\nSecondly, they exist upon the terrestrial network. They'd like to boost transmitter power so that people like you don't have such problems (I know what you're experiencing, we have encountered the same). But guess what - the government won't let them, because it degrades the analog signal slightly, they can only boost the signal when more people have switched. And people won't switch while they are outside the transmitter range: it's a classic chicken and egg situation.\n\nThey are tied down at every angle by regulation - for instance the government requires that they transmit regional TV. Regional TV is in my opinion a waste of time, most people I know don't give a rats ass that Mrs. Nobody got her cat stuck up her tree, or that it's the Xth anniversary of the Albert Docks. However, they must not only transmit regionally, but also subregionally. The total number of separate transmission streams comes to 33! That's 33 separate industrial MPEG decoders, and at a cool quarter million each, that is a significant investment. Sky of course just give the UK the finger.\n\nMurdoch used the classic Microsoft trick of subsidising its way into the market as well - by starting the box wars he raised the inital investment by billions. He can afford to lose that much: dominance of the media is more important to him than actual cold, hard profit. It's similar to the MS X-BOX situation.\n\nMismanagement from the top doesn't help either - their enormous bids for football were way out. So you see, all these factors have meant that Sky have walked over ITV Digital, and it's NOT a good thing. Bear in mind that, despite ITV having to pay for the networks creation and development (the UK had the first digital TV infrastructure in the world remember), it's also an open platform. Sky TV is of course, utterly closed, and by pulling this sort of stuff, Murdoch is pissing all over the British people. That's why I hate him, even though eventually we got tired of repeated transmission faults and switched... to sky:("}

In reality, PDF documents are easily exploited by cybercriminals, who can take control of a computer in an organisation simply by inserting a Java script into a PDF document, he said.\n\nAn increasing number of legitimate websites are also being exploited by cybercriminals to carry out attacks using SQL-injection, which is also invisible to end-users targeted by these attacks.\n\nCybercriminals are focusing on stealing information, which can be done by planting malware on legitimate websites, include those routinely visited by companies under standard business processes, he said. According to Lyne, up to 70% of legitimate websites are routinely targeted by cybercriminals for information such as log-in credentials, intellectual property and financial information.\n\n\"Cybercriminals are outsourcing information captured in this way to specialists in various industry verticals who can make sense of the data and sell that intelligence to other criminals"}
{"text":"Cyber security threat to India is real\n\nThe demand for better methods to enforce cyber security has grown stronger since the November 26 attacks in Mumbai [ Images ].\n\nIndia [ Images ] has a dedicated organisation, CERT-In -- which operates under the auspices of the department of communication and information technology -- to tackle cyber crimes. However, the agency is not a prosecuting body.\n\nAn officer at CERT-In told rediff.com over the telephone from New Delhi [ Images ] that although the agency does not have the legal power to examine cyber crimes, it can probe cases referred to the organisation.\n\nCERT-In, which covers both government and military areas, says the threats relating to cyber security are on the rise. Common targets include critical infrastructure like telecommunication, transportation, energy and finance.\n\nThe attackers are not confined to information infrastructures and geographical boundaries. They exploit network interconnections and navigate easily through the infrastructure. More worryingly, these cyber criminals are becoming more skilled at masking their behaviour.\n\nCERT-In consists a group of professionals headed by a director who investigate cases referred to the agency. It submits a report to the police station that has sought the agency's help following which a chargesheet is filed.\n\nWhy not a single agency?\n\nSenior police officers say it is difficult to have a single agency looking at such cases.\n\nIf a crime is committed in a particular state, it is easier for police officers of that state to probe the case. At present, one police officer adds, no one person has complete charge of cyber security.\n\nAlthough the Union government drafts all cyber laws and CERT-In assists in investigations, the final call can be taken by the cyber crime wings based in the states.\n\nThe only other national agency which can probe cyber crime cases is the Central Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe prosecuting agency\n\nThe ministry for communication and information technology governs the system pertaining to cyber security. While the ministry is largely involved in drafting laws, the actual job on the ground is handled by the cyber-crime wings in the states.\n\nThe law is clear that a complaint pertaining to a cyber crime or threat can be assigned only to the jurisdictional cyber crime wing in each state. An inspector general of police heads each cyber crime wing; a superintendent of police, inspectors and sub inspectors report to her\/him. Only this department can file a chargesheet and prosecute individuals involved in cyber criminal activity.\n\nThe inspector general of police reports to the state police chief.\n\nAn officer in the Karnataka [ Images ] cyber crime wing said it is often difficult to crack a case as the cell does not have enough IT professionals. In such cases, CERT-In's assistance is sought.\n\nExperts feel the process of investigating a cyber crime is cumbersome under the present set-up. It is difficult to have a national level agency which takes a final call since Indian law clearly states that cases will be probed on a jurisdictional basis for all practical purposes.\n\nR Srikumar, a former Karnataka police chief and chairman of the Cyber Society of India (Karnataka chapter), says that trained personnel could be inducted into cyber crime cells so that the procedure of referring the matter to another agency and then waiting for a report to proceed with the prosecution can be avoided.\n\nProfessor Chandrashekar, a forensics expert and a member of the CSI, believes dedicated teams of IT professionals should be appointed by respective state governments to work with the cyber crime wings.\n\nFormer CBI Director R Raghavan launched the first cyber society in Tamil Nadu. Professor Chandrashekar explains that the society's role is to train professionals in cracking cyber crimes.\n\nHe says the society will sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Law School, Bengaluru [ Images ], to introduce a course in cyber security. The course will issue a certificate to certified cyber crime investigators.\n\nCyber crime wings in the states could then employ such certified investigators.\n\nAlthough private security agencies investigate cyber crimes, the Union government has not made full use of their services as is the case in some countries.\n\nSources say the government may seek the skills of private agencies in select cases, but would prefer to improve official cyber crime wings since such cases often involve national security."}

Digital activism has played a major role in various political and cultural clashes and has been oftentimes met with harsh resistance by governments attempting to silence digital organizing and independent media journalists.\n\nUsing internet filtering methods as well as technological and offline sanctioning strategies, governments are going after digital activists in increasingly invasive ways.\n\nThe survey addresses blogger assumption of online risk, their knowledge of digital security practices and their reported online security functions.

{"text":"Android malware is increasingly becoming a concern for users, but a team of researchers at North Carolina State University is hoping to help fight the problem by understanding it better. Lead by assistant professor Xuxian Jiang, the Android Malware Genome Project is collecting samples of Android malware in order to categorize them and release the code to other researchers. So far over 1,200 samples have been collected and organized based on features like how they're downloaded and activated. Based on research conducted last November, the team found that Android security software tools were only able to detect at most 79.6 percent of malware-ridden apps, and sometimes as little as 20.2 percent. It's an area that could use some improvement.\n\nThe information gathered will eventually be available to other researchers, though it likely won't be made fully public due to security concerns \u2014 instead there will be some sort of verification system put in place to ensure only the right people have access to the samples. And despite the constant evolution of malware, Jiang believes that understanding it better will help fight future iterations. \"Previous experiences indicate that the study of how malware evolves is helpful to even predict what kind of malware we may expect in the future,\" he told Dark Reading. \"Such insights should be needed to proactively better develop mobile security apps and protect users.\""}

And the support from netizens on facebook and twitter (@opindia_back) is swelling. The group, which swears by non-violent protests, has now threatened to intensify the cyber attacks. They demand that the Centre immediately lift the curbs on Internet freedom and make a statement on the issue.\n\nThe hacktivists talked to this correspondent on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) using a variety of nicknames such as 'AnonFengshui', 'Anon3x3_kalki', 'anamikanon', 'gummy', 'lucifer' in the chat.\n\nDifferent people answered the same question and here are the excerpts:\n\nQuestion:\nHow many members are there in Anonymous?\n\nAnon:\nWe have never counted the members. Perhaps there could be dozens. We cannot be called Anonymous, if we count the people. That means we are actually tracking them.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the purpose in hacking websites? What do you achieve by hacking the websites of private companies?\n\nAnon:\nWe are targeting supporters of censorship, not just those in political power. In the name of blocking suspicious sites, they blocked popular sites also. By defacing or DDoSing (Distributed Denial of Service or network attacks) the websites, we get our message across to the people who matter. It is a healthier way of protesting than launching fast-unto-deaths.\n\nQuestion:\nAre you all Indians or from other countries?\n\nAnon:\nWe are sans identity. We have no nationality in that sense. There are people from other countries also but most of the Anons are Indians.\n\nQuestion:\nDo you intend to intensify the attacks now?\n\nAnon:\nAs of now, we are going easy on the government websites. We may or may not intensify the attacks. But it depends on the reaction of the government.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat sort of a reaction are you expecting?\n\nAnon:\nThe reaction we expect is that the government must bow before its people and free us from censorship. We are expecting that the government issue a statement making its stand known on Internet censorship. We expect the government to rescind the censorship and ensure that the freedom of speech is protected.\n\nQuestion:\nWould it just be defacements or would you use DDoS attacks also?\n\nAnon:\nWe will use both. The CERT officials, who issued advisories on possible DDoS attacks, got themselves DDoSed by us!\n\nQuestion:\nDo you think people will participate in large numbers in the occupy movement on June 9?\n\nAnon:\nWe expect the number to be large, but it will be a non-violent, democratic protest.\n\nQuestion:\nSince Occupy protests are called in several cities, can we expect that websites of organisations in those cities to be attacked?\n\nAnon:\nYes. Sure. There would be attacks on sites, but that has no correlation with protests on ground.\n\nQuestion:\nDon't you fear that the police can track you?\n\nAnon:\nThe protesters are not hackers. They are normal people who want their Internet back. We all fear getting caught. But when we joined the free Internet protest, we threw the police fear out of our minds. The values of freedom are important enough for taking the risk.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat if the government does not respond to your protests?\n\nAnon:\nWe are average Internet users who try to get our message through by Defacing\/DDoSing. We don't like to be under pressure anymore. We will bring the government to its knees. We will strike hard, no mercy and fast!\n\nQuestion:\nWhat do you want to tell the people?\n\nAnon:\nWake up. Speak up, before you lose the right to do it. We want you to support us. We are Anonymous, we are legion, we do not forgive, we do not forget, Government of India! Expect us!"}
{"text":"5 Takeaways From Black Hat 2010\n\nBlack Hat, the largest and most visible hacker conference, is winding down in Las Vegas. It always brings a series of shocks and this year didn't disappoint. What did we learn this year?\n\n1. Your money isn't safe - Researcher Barnaby Jack demonstrated how to hack automated teller machines (ATMs). He did it both by physically opening the machine and installing malware on it and by compromising it over the network. It turns out these machines, or at least some of them, aren't all that aggressively secured.\n\n3. Your electric service isn't safe - Jonathan Pollet, founder of Red Tiger Security, told Black Hat attendees of the weaknesses in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used in utilities like power companies to manage and monitor equipment. SCADA vendors and users are way behind IT generally when it comes to security. Vulnerabilities go for long times unpatched. Unnecessary software, like chat clients, are used on critical systems, which are sometimes connected to the Internet. Pollet also warned of the weak security state of \"smart meters\" being rolled out all over the country.\n\n4. Your home router isn't safe - A new trick found by researcher Craig Heffner makes it easier for attackers to gain usable access to your home network. Hacking into the router can be done in many ways, but once you're in it's hard to get an address on the internal network. Heffner showed a Javascript hack that allows an attacker to use DNS Rebiding to gain an internal address. There are mitigating measures you can take, but they're complex or inconvenient.\n\n5. Black Hat itself isn't safe - For the first time this year, Black Hat made their sessions available through a video feed, using a 3rd party service, for a $395 fee. One subscriber realized that it was easy to trick the service into providing the videos for free. It's not a good thing to show weakness like this to the Black Hat"}
{"text":"Does Cloud Computing Hurt or Help Hackers?\n\nFrom your personal banking records to your company's intellectual property and confidential information, data security was easier to oversee before so much of our world moved online and into The Cloud. But the convenience of cloud computing is intoxicating, and we're all living in the cloud more and more every day, both at work and at play.\n\nUnfortunately, with convenience comes exposure. The headlines are rife with cautionary tales of personal identity theft and corporate data breaches, and hackers show no signs of slowing their efforts to get their hands on sensitive information. So, just how dangerous is the cloud? Is cloud computing enabling cybercrooks, making it easier for them to practice their nefarious trade? At focus.com, folks tackled the topic of cybercrime in the cloud when answering the question \"Does the accessibility of cloud computing make hacking easier?\"\n\nIndustry analyst James McGovern goes \"out on a limb\" (albeit a strong limb on an old-growth trunk), and says yes. He is of a mind that the cloud makes hacking easier \"on several fronts\"\u2014not the least of which saves ne'er-do-wells a good deal of time and trouble. Cybercrooks, it seems, enjoy the convenience of one-stop online shopping when laying the groundwork for an assault. McGovern asserts: \"The ability for a hacker to spin up a couple of thousand instances using a stolen credit card to do a brute force attack is certainly easier than finding a thousand PCs to turn into zombies via writing custom viruses.\"\n\nGlen Marshall, principal at Grok-A-Lot, sees the situation differently. He believes cloud computing doesn't make hacking easier, it \"just introduces new risks that proper risk management would identify.\" Phil Wainewright, CEO of Procullux Ventures, seconds Marshall's no vote, but for a different reason. Wainewright proffers that the sheer accessibility of cloud computing increases the likelihood of hacking attempts, yet also notes that \"the operators of cloud computing assets [are] more wary and alert against hacking attempts.\" The net effect, then, is that it's \"harder to hack cloud computing\u2014unless you're hacking a cloud computing operator that doesn't have a clue what it's doing.\"\n\nNot quite fitting into the straightforward 'yes\/no' camps, BrainWave Consulting's Andrew S. Baker steered the conversation in another direction. As he sees it, cloud computing doesn't make hacking easier per se, but it does make for a more desirable target. \"Internet-accessible systems can be attacked remotely,\" he explains. \"What they contain, or the purpose they serve, won't necessarily make them easier to hack, but might make it more desirable to attack them, due to the greater potential payoff.\"\n\nBaker notes that we're seeing more attacks on cloud computing because attacks in general are on the rise: \"Even if we never moved beyond basic web hosting and collocation services, we'd be seeing a lot more cyberattacks, because there is still money to be made by doing it, and it's still relatively difficult to catch the attackers.\"\n\nOK, so the jury's out\u2014but one message is clear: When it comes to keeping data safe, as Baker says, \"Ongoing vigilance is required, whether or not one embraces the cloud.\" Marshall agrees, and puts the onus of responsibility squarely at the cloud provider's doorstep: \"It is still up to a cloud-based service provider to protect itself based on identified risks, just as the same service provider would need to do in a non-cloud environment. The tooling may be different, but the business risk management obligations remain the same.\"\n\nFinally, FiveCubits' Jeff Gullang reminds us that, as is the case with most technology, end-users are often the weakest link. \"Everyone knows someone who keeps their password on a sticky note in the third drawer, or wherever else, and half have 'password12345' as their log-on,\" he says. \"The system is strong except for its weakest part: users.\""}

{"text":"Don't fear the digital bogeyman. Virtual conflict is still more hype than reality.\n\nVery unlikely. When news of Stuxnet broke, the New York Times reported that the most striking\naspect of the new weapon was the \"collateral damage\" it created. The malicious\nprogram was \"splattered on thousands of computer systems around the world, and\nmuch of its impact has been on those systems, rather than on what appears to\nhave been its intended target, Iranian equipment,\" the Timesreported. Such\ndescriptions encouraged the view that computer viruses are akin to highly\ncontagious biological viruses that, once unleashed from the lab, will turn\nagainst all vulnerable systems, not just their intended targets.\n\nBut this metaphor is deeply\nflawed. As the destructive potential of a cyberweapon grows, the likelihood\nthat it could do far-reaching damage across many systems shrinks. Stuxnet did\ninfect more than 100,000 computers -- mainly in Iran, Indonesia, and India,\nthough also in Europe and the United States. But it was so specifically\nprogrammed that it didn't actually damage those machines, afflicting only\nIran's centrifuges at Natanz. The worm's aggressive infection strategy was\ndesigned to maximize the likelihood that it would reach its intended target.\nBecause that final target was not networked, \"all the functionality required to\nsabotage a system was embedded directly in the Stuxnet executable,\" the\nsecurity software company Symantec observed in its analysis of the worm's code.\nSo yes, Stuxnet was \"splattered\" far and wide, but it only executed its\ndamaging payload where it was supposed to.\n\nCollateral infection, in short, is not necessarily\ncollateral damage. A sophisticated piece of malware may aggressively infect\nmany systems, but if there is an intended target, the infection will likely\nhave a distinct payload that will be harmless to most computers. Especially in\nthe context of more sophisticated cyberweapons, the image of inadvertent\ncollateral damage doesn't hold up. They're more like a flu virus that only\nmakes one family sick to"}

CSIS' intent was to draft recommendations that the next administration could put in place to avoid future cyber mishaps.\n\n\"Although the most sensitive U.S. military communications remain safe, economic competitors and potential military opponents have easy access to military technology, intellectual property of leading companies, and government data,\" CSIS said. \"Our most dangerous opponents are the militaries and intelligence services of other nations. They are sophisticated, well resourced, and persistent.\"\n\nThe group made nine recommendations, the first of which was the creation of a comprehensive cyber-security strategy. \"Comprehensive means using all the tools of the U.S. power in a coordinated fashion,\" CSIS said.\n\nThat coordination, however, should be handled by the White House \u2013 specifically, a new cyberspace office within the Executive Office of the President. This person would work with existing cyber-security officials and the National Security Council to manage the many aspects of a nationwide strategy.\n\nCSIS also called for revamped cyber-security legislation, improved authentication, the acquisition of the most secure products from the private sector, and increased research and training.\n\nFinally, CSIS warned against scrapping the work the Bush administration has done on the issue. President Bush's Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative includes unnecessary secrecy but \"is a good place to start,\" CSIS said.\n\n\"Our principle recommendations for security do not call for a supercop but for a strategist who, under the direction of the president, can plan and implement the move to a secure, information-age national government,\" the study"}

{"text":"Earlier today, the newspaper revealed that hackers probably connected to the Chinese military had spent four months trying to hack into the email accounts of dozens of its journalists, entering the network via compromised PCs.\n\nForensics carried out by the paper's security consultant Mandiant showed that the weapon of choice was 45 pieces of targeted Trojan malware, only one of which was detected by the installed Symantec antivirus software.\n\nClearly sensitive to the issue, Symantec's response has been to issue a statement implying that such sophisticated attacks could only be stopped using a layered security approach.\n\n\"Advanced attacks like the ones the New York Times described in the following article, underscore how important it is for companies, countries and consumers to make sure they are using the full capability of security solutions,\" read a statement.\n\n\"Turning on only the signature-based anti-virus components of endpoint solutions alone are not enough in a world that is changing daily from attacks and threats.\"\n\nSymantec did not say whether the New York Times had access to those extra layers of security, nor why they would not have been configured if they had.

{"text":"Washington is in the midst of debating something called \"cybersecurity.\" But that term actually includes several very separate and distinct problems that call for very different solutions. Not only does conflating them confuse the issue \u2014 it also has very distinct political consequences. So let's unpack the separate meanings of the term.\n\n1. Criminal and malicious online behavior\nAs every computer owner knows, internet security is a very real problem for individual households and businesses. The open architecture of computers and the internet has led to an explosion of innovation, collaboration, and creativity \u2014 but the very openness that has fuelled so much innovation has also made us vulnerable to viruses, spyware, and other forms of malware. These problems are endemic among home computers and among a surprising number of professionally managed institutional machines as well. Much of this is due to the failure to perform basic computer security"}
{"text":"When I first started this series my goal was to remove any mystery around botnets. In fact, most botnets, like this one, are relatively simple. In this post we will explore the command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure, as well as the bot's update mechanism.\n\nA C&C interface is the primary user interface between the botmaster and the legion of infected hosts participating in the botnet. Since it is present in every botnet (although there are many different types of interfaces), it is one of the primary things we look for when attempting to determine if any machines have been compromised. From a botmaster's perspective, it would seem that this is a key feature that must be carefully designed to avoid detection. But surprisingly, a very large percentage we see are very simple, just like this one. That said, at times it can be very much a cat-and-mouse game between botmasters and people in my industry.\n\nRemotely controlling multiple machines is a basic principal that botmasters must address. You need to be able to command your nodes in a fairly efficient manner. If you have 10,000 nodes you do not want to issue a command 10,000 times. You want to issue it once and have all 10,000 nodes respond in a timely manner so that you know if the command was successful.\n\nIn this example the author decided to use internet relay chat (IRC). The use of IRC is very common among simple bots since it's easy to understand and there are lots of implementations publicly available. There is a trade off though: because IRC is a well-documented protocol, it is extremely easy to detect and monitor. Infiltrating a Botnet that is IRC-based is a trivial task. Some botnets try to mitigate this issue by doing things like requiring server and channel passwords or even using SSL encryption, but none of those efforts are really effective. Passwords are easily sniffed off a network and anything being encrypted can be spied on with a debugger. Read More \u00bb\n\nPrivacy and information leakage has become one of my favorite topics on the Security blog. It seems that an enormous amount of information is being willingly plastered all over the Internet, from which significant value can be extracted (especially when combined with other public, or more likely private, datasets). The results are mind-boggling, and the implications are not fully comprehensible. Yet another example of this came to light recently from security professional Roger Thompson's blog.\n\nAs we described in the Cyber Risk Report for the week of December 14, Thompson had a credit card suspended because of fraud concerns. As he called to reactivate the card and prove his identity to the fraud division at his bank, he was asked questions regarding his daughter-in-law that were not things that should have been tied to him in traditional security questions. His assumption is that the information was gleaned from a public source, such as a social networking site.\n\nDuring the course of security research we often acquire new malware samples. We typically first try to determine what we have acquired and if it is a new or otherwise unknown malware sample or if it is a mutation of something that we have already seen. There are several ways in which a sample can be tested, but the simplest way is to compare the MD5 checksum of the malware sample against other known checksums \u2014 several services exist where you can look up the hash of a sample, such as Malware Hash Registry by Team Cymru, VirusTotal, and MalwareHash. These services work by analyzing samples against antivirus products from several vendors (often thirty or forty different products). If the sample has previously been analyzed, the results will often tell what percentage of antivirus products detect the sample. Most of the time this method is sufficient on samples that are more than a few days old; however, on samples that are recent (perhaps discovered within the last twenty-four hours) the effectiveness of this method is marginal, illustrating the highly reactive nature of the industry.\n\nSince antivirus products are often used as a cure for poor user discretion, I thought I would track the effectiveness of antivirus products on new malware samples that we received and test some of the samples a week later to note how the coverage improved. I think the results will show that new malware samples have a window of opportunity where end users are particularly vulnerable to the new malware strains.\n\nSocial media security has been a major focus of the Cisco Security blog in the past several months. We believe so strongly in sharing the message of using social media in a secure way that it was also a prominent focus in the 2009 Cisco Annual Security Report. In the 2009 report, we discussed how criminals, like predators in the wild, migrate to where their victims can be found. Recently, that has been on social networking sites and services.\n\nThese days botnets are all over the news. Often we hear them described in vague, ominous terms designed to grab people's attention. In simple terms, a botnet is a group of computers networked together running a piece of malicious software that allows them to be controlled by a remote attacker, better known as a botmaster. Often I think people abuse their readers to a certain extent by over-hyping certain threats. I would like to take a more reasonable approach here.\n\nOur team has a lab dedicated to running malicious software that we refer to as our malware lab. We use the lab to ensure our security products work against various real-world threats. Basically, we do things like intentionally leaving hosts un-patched behind security devices and purposefully infect and attack boxes protected by various devices. This helps to ensure that in a worst-case scenario we know our products work. To that end, I periodically track down new samples of malware. Recently, I came across a sample that could be used to create your own botnet.\n\nI will explain exactly what this bot does; I'll even show you some of the code. This is a very simple and generic example of a bot and is very likely no threat to your network. It's designed as a kit to be distributed to inexperienced botmasters. It's the Easy-Bake Oven of botnets, but the concepts I will cover extend to the most complex botnets.\n\nThis will be the first in a series of posts exploring a bot written in the Java programming language. Because the Java is easier to read than most, throughout this series we will explore the actual code for the more interesting features"}

{"text":"You have your answer, but I'll add some background anyway.\nTEMPEST is old stuff (US\/UK). Anyone who's ever worked in COMSEC\n(Government Communications Security) knows about TEMPEST, it was a big\ndeal during the cold war. Most of the basic stuff was declassified in\n1995.\nIt's simply the ability to block any and all unintentional signals\n('electro-magnetic radiation') which may emanate from communication or\ndata processing equipment. There's two parts of COMSEC equipment, the\npart than handles the plain text data like I\/O, processor and memory\n(red side), and the part that's not involved in unencrypted data like\npower supplies and I\/O that carries encrypted data (black side). One of\nthe earlier examples of a TEMPEST leak was the ability to pick up typed\ntext from the power lines into teletype equipment or even the IBM\nSelectric typewriters. Some of the embassies on both sides of the cold\nwar were found to have innocent wires stretched across the ceiling of\nthe comm center but with both ends unterminated, which apparently\noperated as a simplistic amplifier or pickup. Many bugs picked up and\nrepeated electronic, not audio signals. The U.S. Embassy in the USSR\nhad to be rebuilt in the '80s because the concrete was peppered with\npassive electronic components (things like resistors and real bugs).\nA simple demonstration of TEMPEST vulnerability is by using a telco\nimpedance pickup. The impedance pickup will amplify voice (or data) on\na phone wire without needing to touch the metal wire. It picks up the\nvarying magnetic field around a wire which expands and collapses as the\nsignal changes. (It also buzzes radically when near fluorescent bulbs,\nold high-leakage CRT monitors, some LCDs, some keyboards, and some\nmice).\nAnother related term you might want to google is SIGINT, or Signals\nIntelligence. It covers the ability to collect, and process, signals.\nThere's more to it than meets the eye. The position of a signal can be\ntriangulated electronically within a few milliseconds, 'position' is\ndata. The keystrokes or other characteristics of encrypted data can\ntell you who the operator is, 'characteristic' is data you can link with\nHUMINT (Human Intelligence). Then there's the conversation, sorta tells\nyou who's talking to who and what's been escalated up to or repeated\nfrom headquarters (makes life easy if someone in the conversation passes\nalong a message using weak crypto or a compromised key). Many INTEL\nsatellites are SIGINT, more like radioscopes pointed down which join the\nhubble-sister telescopes pointed down.\n(Note: Encryption applies privacy only temporarily. Encryptions of the\npast are obsolete and weak today, and can be decrypted at leisure.)\nThat's what TEMPEST is worried about. Leaking signal from red side to\nblack side, that signal getting picked up by some guy with telco gear, a\nbug in the wall or an antenna in the ceiling, or a trio of satellites\nabove.

{"text":"Expert: US in cyberwar arms race with China, Russia\n\nRick Wilking \/ Reuters file\n\nFirst Lt Michael Newman examines a server rack that is isolated from the Internet at the Air Force Space Command Network Operations & Security Center at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo., in July 2010.\n\nBy Robert Windrem, Senior Investigative Producer, NBC News\n\nThe United States is locked in a tight race with China and Russia to build destructive cyberweapons capable of seriously damaging other nations' critical infrastructure, according to a leading expert on hostilities waged via the Internet.\n\nScott Borg, CEO of the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, a nonprofit institute that advises the U.S. government and businesses on cybersecurity, said all three nations have built arsenals of sophisticated computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other tools that place them atop the rest of the world in the ability to inflict serious damage on one another, or lesser powers.\n\nRanked just below the Big Three, he said, are four U.S. allies: Great Britain, Germany, Israel and perhaps Taiwan.\n\nBut in testament to the uncertain risk\/reward ratio in cyberwarfare, Iran has used attacks on its nuclear program to bolster its offensive capabilities and is now developing its own \"cyberarmy,\" Borg said.\n\nBorg offered his assessment of the current state of cyberwar capabilities Tuesday in the wake of a report by the American computer security company Mandiant linking hacking attacks and cyber espionage against the U.S. to a sophisticated Chinese group known as \"Peoples Liberation Army Unit 61398.\n\nAccording to a new White House report released today, cyber spying and other forms of economic espionage are a growing national security threat \u2013 especially from China, where hackers are able to quietly and discreetly acquire source code from U.S. companies. NBC's Andrea Mitchell reports.\n\nIn today's brave new interconnected world, hackers who can defeat security defenses are capable of disrupting an array of critical services, including delivery of water, electricity and heat, or bringing transportation to a grinding halt. U.S. senators last year received a closed-door briefing at which experts demonstrated how a power company employee could take down the New York City electrical grid by clicking on a single email attachment, the New York Times reported.\n\nU.S. officials rarely discuss offensive capability when discussing cyberwar, though several privately told NBC News recently that the U.S. could \"shut down\" the electrical grid of a smaller nation -- Iran, for example \u2013 if it chose to do so.\n\nBorg echoed that assessment, saying the U.S. cyberwarriors, who work within the National Security Agency, are \"very good across the board. \u2026 There is a formidable capability.\"\n\n\"Stuxnet and Flame (malware used to disrupt and gather intelligence on Iran's nuclear program) are demonstrations of that,\" he said. \"\u2026 (The U.S.) could shut down most critical infrastructure in potential adversaries relatively quickly.\"\n\nChina, Russia have different priorities Borg said China and Russia have similar capacity to cause mayhem, but have different priorities and skill sets.\n\nusccu.us\n\nScott Borg says the U.S. possesses a 'formidable capability' to wage cyberwar.\n\n\"Russia is best at military espionage and operations,\" he said. \"That's what they have focused on for a long time. China is looking for crucial business information and technology. China's main focus is stealing technology. These things quite separate. You use different tools on critical infrastructure than you use for military espionage and different tools again on stealing technology.\"\n\nBorg said that each has its strong suit. \"The Russians are technically advanced. The Chinese just have more people dedicated to the effort, by a wide margin,\" he said. \"They are not as innovative or creative as the U.S. and Russia. China has the greatest quantity, if not quality.\"\n\nBorg said the group featured in Mandiant's report, the People's Liberation Army Unit 61398, may be one of the most important groups working in China, but not necessarily the most important.\n\n\"There are at least two dozen groups carrying out aggressive operations against the U.S.,\" he said. \"They get in each other's way and trip over one another, but they are all operating with the tacit approval of the Chinese government.\n\n\"They're not cooperating with each other because they don't share capabilities,\" he added. \"One group has good programming, but is bad at access or targeting.\"\n\nThe Chinese hacking efforts are so broad, Borg said, that the highest-ranking Chinese officials \"almost certainly do not know what all the groups are doing,\" or the consequences. As a result, he added, they have been embarrassed by reports like the one in Tuesday's New York Times, which first reported on the Mandiant assessment.\n\nChina is the most likely of the superpowers to leave a calling card, making their work the easiest to track. \"China is very arrogant in its authorship of cyberweapons,\" Borg said. \"It does little to conceal its identity.\"\n\nThat's in sharp contrast to the Russians, who he noted are not above writing code in Chinese to throw off investigators.\n\nWhile the U.S. could respond to ongoing cyberattacks from China and Russia by shutting down the power grid of \"any of its adversaries\" and causing severe physical damage, Borg said it is encumbered by several factors.\n\nOne is its vulnerability to cyberwarfare as the world's most networked nation, he said.\n\nAnd from a geopolitical standpoint, Borg said, the U.S. would not want to badly damage the economy of either China or Russia. In fact, he said, the U.S. would almost certainly have to incorporate protections for critical systems like the power grid in any cyberattack.\n\nAlso, detecting the source of hostilities is not always easy, Borg said, as cybertracks are not as easy to follow as missile tracks. That means \"mutually assured destruction,\" the main strategic tenet of the Cold War, is problematic at best when talking about cyberwar, he said.\n\n\"It might be difficult to determine proportionate response,\" he said. \"It might not be simple to attack the attacker.\"\n\nFor example, policymakers may think an attack has been carried out by the Chinese, when it was actually the work of the Russians or a rising power in the cyber world, like Iran. That is why intelligence -- getting insight into these operations -- is more important in a crisis than cyberforensics, which can take longer and not be as certain.\n\n\"There is no MAD in the Cold War sense,\" he said, \"You can't be 'assured' of attribution. The attack can be anonymous. It can be spoofed,\" or disguised as coming from another source.\n\nIran developing 'serious capability' The U.S. first began to develop its own offensive capabilities 20 years ago when several strategic thinkers, particularly at the Naval Post-Graduate School, began to see the possibilities. It was not so much a strategic priority, but more \"people familiar with electronics and hackers exercising their imagination.\" (Borg says one of those thinkers, Winn Schwartau, used fiction to discuss the threat and the possibilities, in a 1991 book, \"Terminal Compromise.\")\n\nWhile the U.S. has the means to respond and to defend itself, Borg notes that some countries have no recourse. He cited the Russian invasion of the Republic of Georgia in August 2008, when the Georgian government and media infrastructure was quickly compromised.\n\nWhat was particularly interesting, Borg said, was that the Russian military and intelligence services weren't directly involved.\n\n\"The first wave was carried by organized crime,\" he noted. \"The second wave was carried out by a (hacker) group organized though social media.\" He said Russian hackers could download the attack software from a variety of popular sites, including dating and gun-collecting websites.\n\nIn both cases, Borg concluded, the organizers apparently were tipped off early about the timing of Russian military operations, he said.\n\nThe attack on Georgia also illustrated another aspect of cyberwarfare, Borg said, noting that Georgia, Estonia and Lithuania afterward formed a cyberalliance, leaving them in a better position to deal with future assaults.\n\nThat also appears to be the case with Iran, which recently announced that it decided to establish cyber army and claimed to have 4,000 to 5,000 military personnel involved in defensive and offensive operations. That isn't all bluster, Borg said, noting that when the U.S. leveled new sanctions on Iranian banks last year, U.S. banks suddenly came under attack.\n\n\"Iran is developing a serious capability,\" said Borg. \"It's exaggerating the present capabilities, but it's working toward the future.\"\n\nThat's especially troubling because the risk of smaller nations waging cyberwar against one other may be higher than with the online superpowers, he said.\n\nHe cited reports indicating that Iran may have been behind what he called one of the more serious cyberattacks to date -- an assault last August on the Saudi Aramco computer network that disabled more than 30,000 computers used to control the flow of Saudi oil. The Saudi Interior Ministry blamed \"foreign countries\" for the attack.\n\nBorg said he believes the attack was an \"Iranian fundamentalist attack ... at some point loosely the under auspices of Iran, and blessed by Iran. The fundamentalist group made a claim of responsibility. ... \"Based on technical analysis, the claim has credibility.\"\n\nFor that reason, Borg says he is less worried about the possibility of China or Russia launching a catastrophic attack against the U.S. than he is about the emerging cyberpowers.\n\n\"What I'm really concerned about isn't Russia or China, but attacks from Iran or terrorist groups working with state actors,\" he said.\n\nDiscuss this post\n\nIf China were afraid of the USA, it wouldn't be doing this. But they ain't afraid. Heck, if we can't defeat a bunch of tent-dwelling goat-herders in Afghanistan after 14 years of fighting, we can't do much to 1.3 billion Chinese with high-tech gadgets and weapons, can we? LOL\n\nHow do you propose making them afraid of us? We're not going to attack China (or Russia) under anything but the most extreme circumstances because the consequences are so severe for everyone involved. They know, we know and the world knows it. And, the same is true of those countries. We're all three at a stand-off with each country making probing (cyber) attacks, but stopping well, well short of full-scale cyber invasion.\n\nAs the article pointed out, the real risk is from countries that feel that they have nothing to lose, or are so fanatical that they just don't care.\n\nNo matter what happens: keep going to Wal Mart and buy all the Chinese stuff you can cram in your Korean Cars. And if you are a gubmint employee make double sure you export your paychecks\/retirement checks to those people who would like to kill your children. Make sure nobody talks you out of doing this. You must show your independence and freedom. Remember the money you export to China may fund their program aimed at you - and you don't want anyone to disrupt that.\n\nYou make a good point with respect to Walmart. They are essentially a local storefront for Chinese factories and they have destroyed the economies in far too many small towns in this country. The money pours in and then, unlike small businesses, it leaves the area.\n\nSeveral towns have refused to allow them in... more, in my opinion, should follow suit.\n\nLooks like government control of the internet has oozed in through the back door-to cement it permanently, all they need is a crisis to invoke the Patriot Act and it's done. And the potential for an attack, or even a heavy probing, to instantly spin out of control in seconds is frightening. A cyber-attack that snuffs out a nations electrical grid with a few seconds delay to confirm, followed with an all out missile launch before the generators kick in to reboot the radars? It appears that finding the perpetrators is time consuming, so what does the attacked nation do when a full scale cyber-attack is launched against their infrastructure?\n\nso is this sudden news coverage because we are trying to make it appear ok that we do this, this meaning hack into other electronic systems? so now we cause panic and get approval from the masses to spy on other countries e-transactions.....?\n\nwhy do we have to play so many games, its sickening\n\nwe are losing ourselves people. This might be a valuable topic, but if it is used as a way to get approval from the people to hack everything our government can, it is an evil topic\n\n\"One is its (US) vulnerability to cyberwarfare as the world's most networked nation\"\n\nThat means that we have potentially far more to lose in a 'cyberwar'.\n\nPerhaps the best defense is more 'compartmentalizing', meaning that hackers would have to break a myriad of access codes to have a significant effect - in other words, severely limit the 'reach' of any single system, which would limit the damage from an attack.\n\nIt's interesting to me why this is all of a sudden getting so much attention. Seems like there's a concerted push to increase cyber security, which sounds great and all, but such increases in security are generally accompanied by further loss of privacy and personal liberty. Wonder what they're going to take from us now.\n\nAlso, we've recently had high ranking government officials compare the security risk from a cyber attack to 9\/11 or Pearl Harbor, actually they said it would make 9\/11 \"pale in comparison.\" With the \"absolute havoc\" some are predicting from a cyber attack, why is it so out of line for people to want to keep and bare arms, including assault rifles? I don't necessarily buy into the fear mongering, but it doesn't seem unreasonable that some do. Given the state of the world we live in, I'd hardly call it paranoia like some of the gun grabbers do.\n\nWhat bothers me, is the insistance on placing all our finances in \"direct deposit\" accounts, and paying all our bills online. We're setting ourselves up for a calamity. All my paychecks come to my bank account through direct deposit. As far as I am concerned, I have NO financial information online, that comes from me, but I am finding out many companies I do\/did business with are passing out my personal information online. Get ready folks, start a really BIG piggy bank!i was wondering why the last two weeks I cant load more than one page at a time, and even then its crappy....yet I can log onto 4 different online video games at the same time with no problem at all...\n\nHec, If I were maintaning US Gov Security, I wouldn't even allow that picture above to be posted. There I see a rack of HP servers, probably DL320. Finding a vulnerability in ILO, I know where to target.\n\nJust as in the nuclear arms race, we're likely light years ahead of Russia and China\n\nI'd disagree in part. As the story mentioned, we're better at it than China - though China devotes more people to it (kind of like their traditional army as well) - but Russia is a different story. Cyber warfare isn't that far off from traditional espionage in that you want to gather info and do damage without being detected. I'm not exactly an expert, but I do believe that Russia may well be one of the best (if not the best) in the world at doing things undiscovered. I don't think we're \"light years\" ahead of them in this race.\n\nBeing light years ahead of China doesn't mean that we can easily defend against their attacks either. There's an old, but still effective method of warfare that entails simply overwhelming your enemy with sheer numbers. Keep them so busy, they can't mount a counter offensive and slowly overwhelm their defenses until you achieve victory. While cyber warfare may be drastically different from traditional warfare, I'd think the overall idea is still effective. If they can throw enough garbage at us at once, something (or several somethings) are bound to get through and cause damageHec, If I were maintaning US Gov Security, I wouldn't even allow that picture above to be postedIf China subjects us to cyber attacks, we could devastate their economy (and ours) by stopping buying their stuff. If we are subjected to cyber attacks by Iran, should we impose the same sanctions we already impose a a result of their nuclear activity, or different sanctions?\n\nWhy thank you sir. It relates to drowning Grover Norquist (and his infamous quote), and I'm proud of the fact that I registered it way back in 2008 before Norquist and his \"Tax Pledge\" began showing up all over the news.\n\nI'd disagree in part. As the story mentioned, we're better at it than China - though China devotes more people to it (kind of like their traditional army as well) - but Russia is a different story.\n\nWhile I'd agree that both China and particularly Russia are serious threats in this \"cyber-arms-race,\" and through sheer numbers could overwhelm our cyber defenses, I still stick by my initial assertion that we (meaning the US military, CIA, NSA, etc.) are far better at this type of espionage\/warfare then we're letting on. That is not to say that other nations are not a threat however.\n\nThey'll claim that Iran is a serious threat, but it took them something like 14 months to reverse-engineer and hack one of our drones they captured when they had the parts right there in front of them. Meanwhile, we've already had the technology to be flying them for well over a decade. And that's just the crap we know aboutabsolutely and well said. A crazy country like North Korea is likely a far greater hacking threat than China, but they're capabilities are also likely far less.The same can be said to this (and to TFNJ) as above. It's probably a mistake to think that the picture floated in this article is ANYTHING architecturally like what we're ACTUALLY using. Having done engineering research for DARPA during graduate school, I'm pretty confident the DOD is well aware of the dangers of information disclosure and doesn't do so lightly.\n\nJust because the guy in this picture has fatigues on, doesn't necessarily mean these are military servers. More likely, they're probably the VA pension benefit servers from 5 years ago or some other similarly inane piece of hardware (even though it says it's at the Air Force base). And yes, i'm joking about it being the pension servers, or maybe not :)\n\nHere's a thought; disconnect critical equipment from the internet. Use dedicated lines that don't connect to the outside world.\n\nthe photo caption actually says the hardware in the picture is disconnected from the internet, unless of course it's really the pension fund server :)\n\nwhy would i even think about shopping anyplace else?\n\noh go the F away you loser. Seriously mods, how come we haven't gotten a ban on this guy yet? He's been posting this same crap (exact same post) for like two weeks now. I've seen faster bans for people calling each other \"retards\" and \"idiots.\" WTF is the holdup?\n\nI agree that the threat is minimal in the scenario I brought up. But, in my paranoid mind, and my thinking ahead to every possible scenario, even if the risk were 1 in 1 million, I wouldn't do it. It pays to be paranoid when it comes to security.\n\nThe US position on cyber attack should be to treat it no different than if an enemy force attacked US soil. While no lives may be lost directly with such attacks, the potential exists to destroy our entire way of life. Our response should leave no question in the mind of the attacker it their cyber attack was a good idea or not. By that I mean any and all options for retaliation are in play, especially nukes. We cannot poo-poo this as anything short of an act of war.\n\nThe Internets origin comes from the days of 'Big Blue' a US DoD communication system that has long been obsolete. I am certain there are more sophisticated systems they are using now. But the internet uses bandwidth from the old DoD communications backbone, adapted to civilian usage, and was turned over to public domain some time ago. With national security in mind, I have serious doubts that the DoD would ever abandon the ability to simply pull the plug. Later systems being corrupted could be a problem.\n\nI still stick by my initial assertion that we (meaning the US military, CIA, NSA, etc.) are far better at this type of espionage\/warfare then we're letting on.\n\nI don't doubt that for a moment. Even as an underling (so to speak) in the military hierarchy, my team and I were never open about our missions or capabilities, even to our brothers-in-arms in other units. Even with my very limited knowledge of the inner workings of the CIA, NSA, etc., I'm quite certain they are capable of far more than we realize.\n\nA crazy country like North Korea is likely a far greater hacking threat than China, but they're capabilities are also likely far less.\n\nIt's not really their overall capabilities I'm worried about so much as what they're willing to do. As the old saying goes, the sun shines on even a dirty dog's butt now and again (or several variations thereof). Meaning, of course, anyone can get lucky once in a while. Considering the lengths I believe countries like North Korea and Iran are willing to go to, any measure of luck on their part could be catastrophic to us and the much of the rest of the world with us.\n\nIt's probably a mistake to think that the picture floated in this article is ANYTHING architecturally like what we're ACTUALLY using\n\nThat is a very good point, and I did think of that after posting my reply to TFNJ. The pension fund comment was funny...and sadly probably has a measure of truth. :) I was actually thinking \"those are probably the servers they use for the army portal\" which is far less secure than anything they would use for cyber security measures.Perhaps I'm a little paranoid. Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get me. :) HAHAHA\n\nmeanwhile 24% of the federal budget goes to military spending- things like tanks, aircraft carrier, missiles- you know stuff for the 21st century (right...). We spend more than the next 12 countries combined. Meanwhile our enemies, even that POS stone age country Iran, have migrated to the 22nd century.\n\nLet's keep arguing about abortion, women's rights, healthcare, the fact that there's a black guy in office. These loser politicians ought to be tried for treason.\n\nWakeUpPeople - who says that - of that 24% of the federal budget spent on military - a healthy portion of that money isn't being funneled into cyber warfare? I've not seen a breakdown on where all that money is going, but I somehow doubt that every penny is being used on \"tanks, aircraft carrier, missiles\", etc.\n\nWhat's more, just because cyberspace is becoming the latest battlefield doesn't mean that we should abandon our armaments of the 20th Century. They're still useful and much needed.\n\nAlso...while \"stone age country Iran\" may be making progress on the cyber front (and posing a very real threat), I somehow doubt that they are a good hundred years ahead of the curve. After all....we're only 13 years into the 21st Century....\n\nWell at least we don't have to send our young men overseas to die in a cyber war. That's one plus. I will never understand why people think the world should fear us. Our bullying and meddling is the whole reason why so many hate us to begin with. As long as we base our foreign policy on trying to make the rest of the world fearful the more fearful and paranoid we will become ourselves. Americans are already scared of their own shadows. How much more fear do we need in the world?So what's your big plan? Perhaps we should start a decade long war with no clear objectives or perhaps we could strip ourselves of more freedoms. If there is a covert \"cyber race\" going on then what makes you think that you would even know about it in the first place? What do you have against mapping the brain anyway? Or eliminating pennies for that matter. It costs nothing to express an idea so what's the problem?\n\nCogitoErgo, Maybe we should stop underfunding our schools... and in those districts where administrative largess exists, address the issue and get our focus back on giving a quality education to our children. Why? If all they teach is political divisiveness and sports rule the world?\n\nUnfortunately, cyber warfare is not the only warfare China is waging against the US. They are also waging trade warfare that Mr. Obama has failed to address in a serious and comprehensive manner. The two types of warfare are being used simultaneously to steal our intellectual property, manufacturing base, jobs and our financial viability.\n\nCan someone please wake up the amateur currently occupying thw WH and tell him that being President is not a celebrity job, but requires serious hard work and decision making followed up by actions.\n\nThe gap between the rich and the poor, the widest of all of industrialized nations, doing a great job \"fixing\" the economy\n\nHow about the military, what a brilliant bunch. Great job in Afghanistan , terrific in Iraq, wonderful humanitarian mission in Libya. And you could keep going back,\n\nTell me one thing, just one thing that they have done successful\u2026?\n\nNow again,only speaking for me, only an imbecile would believe the crAp coming out of Washington. Why would they fix anything? These are the people that destroyed it, now they are going to fix it? No, things are goinig to get much worse\u2026\n\nOur Economy, Bernanke? Again why would anybody believe what this clown says at all? Lets go back for the record again, im not throwing darts at the moron im putting his record out there.\n\nBack before the panic of '08 began, back in 2005 he said, \"there would never be a national real estate crisis. Its never happened before in this country.\" Then as things are unfolding he sad the sub prime mortgage problem \"wasn't going to go into the general mortgage market\" Then in 2007 he said \"America has no risk of going into a recession. Why would anybody look to this guy for anything other then stacking failure on top of failure on top of failure? He doesn't know what he is doing, they are bunch of losers, as I stated, everything they touch they fail at.\n\nDont get me started on our military either, and I mean the top brass, the little psychopath boy generals like Allen and Petraeus. These aren't men. This guy Allen who was in charge of the show in Afghanistan, sending thousands of pages of emails to some chick as the guys are getting their head s blown off and the women getting their legs blown off that are serving over there. Look at this little boy Petraeus I mean come on, do you know how he got there? He married the girl whos father was heading West Point, these guys sucked their way up to the top, they are not fighting men. America has not won a war since WWII, we lost in Vietnam, we lost in Korea. Wait I forgot, we won in Panama and what s that other one? Oh yea Grenada, the big nation of Grenada. Come on, yea they are going to get us into more wars because these are psychopaths. These are not men, they are out of their minds and people keep following them.\n\nAnd that's one of the most critical thoughts that most Americans never want to admit. We do it, and have been doing it for decades.\n\nChina has always been a \"closed\" society to the rest of the world, and what a lot of people, mostly Americans won't realize is the reason America backed out of the Korean and Vietnam wars was because of the backing of those two \"Northern\" regimes by China. America does not now, nor have they ever wanted to go to war with China.\n\nPeople talk now of fear of N. Korea and Iran with nuclear weapons when truth be told, America probably has no idea the capabilities of the Chinese nuclear arsenal. Of course I have no proof of either, except what history has written, and what we see going on today. With China's 1.3billion+ population, it will be hard to defeat.\n\nThey want to hack us, so we should be hacking the heck out of them. I'm sure we are actively doing it, but of course you never hear about it on our news stations. I do know that most of the spam that I see on a website I own comes from China or Russia. They are responsible for >90% of the garbage I see on the site. It is a daily activity to get rid of the accounts that get through the blockers.\n\nIf only the idiots who click on fishing links were as paranoid as you, much of the \"threat\" of cyber warfare would be overblown. I'm so paranoid, I install NoScript on my firefox browser at home, those javascripts ain't gonna get me :)\n\nIdiot Clicker: \"Hmm, its says this email is from my bank, lemme input my account number right now...\"\n\n\/palmfaceUltra-cautious is the best approach. If you're really cautious (and this goes for TFNJ too), check out the NoScript addon for Firefox (if you're not using it already). It prevents ANY java script from running on your browser unless you accept them. Those annoying ads like \"See how this mom makes $5k per week from home,\" and \"New Rule for Drivers, check out how to lower your car insurance,\" yeah, I don't see them, nor do I pick up the keyloggers that come with them :)\n\n(I do at work, cause i don't run noscript there, too much of a hassle).\n\nPerhaps I'm a little paranoid. Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get me. :) HAHAHA\n\nAgreed. As an aside, when you make your tinfoil hats, do you use Reynold's Wrap of the generic brand? I prefer Reynold's, I've found that it holds it shape better.\n\nAlso, do you rock tri-corner Pirate, or Viking style (complete with the cardboard dowels as horns). I prefer Viking, it's more intimidating when the black helicopters swoop down with their mind control rays.\n\nBinary network systems control everything in our world from world banking and finances to energy, governments, the military, food supplies and everything we use presently for living our regular lives. Our world society is made to depend on these networks systems without many even noticing them. Quantum technology is in the process to take control in the future.\n\nThere are many all over the world, who as the new spies, have the knowledge and control of this network system. The danger we all face is coming from these technology knowledgeable folks now part of every government, who can hack into world systems (the new spies, but much more powerful).\n\nOur dependency is pretty scary but I don't see anyone being able to do anything to solve the problem.\n\nLOL, I don't even open jokes sent from friends, unless it is just text. If I get forwarded an email from someone, I just avoid it. In my paranoia I think that they fell for a scam, and are now forwarding it to me.\n\nBut at work, I monitor firewall traffic, and I can see scanning attempts and phishing emails coming in constantly. Most are blocked by the firewall, most scam emails are blocked by spam protection, but some get through and look perfectly believable to the non paranoid type. I see many concerning payroll, banks, online orders, etc. Someone working in one of those departments may think nothing of it. My biggest problem here at work is upper management. They somehow feel internet safety doesn't apply to them.\n\nIf no one ever fell for those email scams, \"hacking\" and the like would drop dramatically. Actually penetrating a network happens very little.\n\nCulheath1.43. That's the way we used to have it. If a transformer blew and someone needed to throw a switch to compensate, a guy would drive to a substation and throw the switch. Totally not hackable. Need a saboteur on the ground to mess with it. So then we fell in love with the Internet, and loaded everything including your sunglasses with tiny little chips from China ( I know the irony is precious) and plugged it all into the Internet. Cause we're smart ! We don't want to pay that guy to drive to the substation. So now we're all crying and waiting for the Chinese to turn our lights out, because we loaded our lives with Chinese junk and made them rich, and transferred our tech to them, and they hate that we have military in the western Pacific and they are getting ready to kill your children. They hate you because you are stupid and gave them all your tech and money - this proves your stupidity and racial inferiority doncha know.\n\nHello folks, when will we ever learn or at least get it! The government has used the same Problem Reaction Solution psychic attack on the sheeple using false flags over and over again and the sheeple buy in to them hook, line and sinker. They have done it with the Oklahoma City bombing, 911 false flag, false WMDs in Iraq, the Aurora - Wisconsin Sikh and Sandy Hook shootings and even the Osama Bin Laden \"seal team six capture, killing and dumping his body in the ocean deception\". Now they are doing it with the \"China, Russia, Iran, Anonymous cyber attacks\". They have most Americans trained like Pavlov's dog, they mention terror or generate a false flag and the sheeple crap their pants! How is it that the only losers in these scenarios are the American people, civil liberties and our constitution?\n\nPROBLEM: Government through their corporate owned presstitutes propagandize that the Internet is unsafe as hackers, China, Iran, Russia, Anonymous, etc.. are threatening the \"American Dream\" by attacking our infrastructure.\n\nREACTION: Oh please Uncle Sam save us! You can take away more of our civil liberties, anything, I'm just so terrified, save us!\n\nSOLUTION: Enact laws and Executive Orders to control the Internet (CISPA, ACTA, PIPA, SOPA). Allow the Utah Spy Center to investigate all voice and data communications in the US.\n\nObama signed an Executive Cyber Security order the day of the State of the Union speech which fits in to the NDRP. The president can take over the Internet whenever he deems there is a \"National Security Risk\".\n\nIt is absolutely shameful and pathetic the cowardice displayed by the American sheeple. You have allowed the government to take away your 4th Amendment right (habeas corpus) through the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the Second Amendment is now under siege. They are now instilling the fear over the \"internet hackers\" so that the First Amendment can be taken away as well.\n\nWe have lost most of our civil liberties through the passage of the Patriot Act, the Foreign Investigation Surveillance Act (FISA), theAct They have eliminated our 4th Amendment (NDAA) and are going after our 2nd Amendment through the back door. What's next, the 1st Amendment?\n\nIt is a joke what the Americans will tolerate. The president just announced via the Fast and Furious Department of Justice \"Memo\" that Obama can assassinate US citizens and where's the outrage? There is none!\n\nWhat is it going to take to get the sheeple to wake up? Not that it won't be hilarious when the presstitutes propagandize that there is a suppository bomber. The sheeple after getting radiated and molested will be bending over at the airports and all public places.\n\nIf you don't see what is happening you are blind\n\nAmerica used to be Land of the Free and Home of the Brave now we are Land of the Detained \u2013\"war on terror\" - debt slaves and Home of the Cowards! My how far we have fallen! What the Hell are we anymore?\n\nInstead of taking the meanest, most ruthless computer people and sponsoring them to further their security skills, as China and Russia has done, the U.S. gives scholarships to minorities and hopes for the best.Do not let the Military Industrial Complex lure you into another costly war from which they will profit and you will be left picking up the tab. The country is broke and we cannot afford another one of these bull@!$%# wars.\n\nThis whole story is horse@!$%#. NBCNews is just another propaganda machine for the real owners of this country.\n\n\"the so-called leading security expert is no other than a paranoina 14 year old kid running his mouth in an online hacking chatroom\"\n\nOne thing that confuses me is why they call cyberwarfare an asymmetric warfare technique, if it's something that the US, Russia and China are developing to use against each other and only the three countries have in full measure. Yeah, Iran may be trying to develop some capability, but even this article makes it pretty clear the US already has the cyberwarfare capability to use cyberwarfare to completely cripple Iran's infrastructure, so, yeah..\n\nIf this a new weapon of choice for superpowers, then, by definition, it isn't asymmetric. It's use is symmetric and subject to the usual arms race dynamic of other weapons systems, among the great powers.\n\nAnd by all accounts, it's a race we're still ahead in, thank goodness.\n\nEasy solution: make me president and I will tell China and Russia the following, and mean it. ONE MORE hack, and we will no longer buy goods from you, or sell any to you. Oh, and that money we owe you, Try and collect, sue me.\n\noh, this would mean that all those \"multi-national\" companies can go take a flying @#$%. Wanna make goods in china, (GM) then get the heck out of America. The Monroe doctrine is sounding better and better every day.\n\nLets have a Worldwide hacking contest.Top 10 winners get a $10 Walmart Gift Certificate, 1 Microsoft Windows 8 OS, 1 Bottle of Vodka, 1 Sony Playstation 4 Console, 1 Turbin,1 Camel and a Yugo. I'd lay odds that in those top 10 that there are going to be a Chinese(He gets the giftcard), An American(He gets the Microsoft OS), A Russian (He gets the Vodka and the Yugo), A Japanese( Sony Playstation goes to him), A Arab and a Iranian(They can fight over the Turbin and the Camel). That contest can be held in Obama's basement.\n\nHere's a thought; disconnect critical equipment from the internet. Use dedicated lines that don't connect to the outside world.\n\nYou are right about how we used to do things. If you go back far enough there were no real electronics involved and all the power devices were electro-mechanical. Most sub-stations had a tender and communication was via dedicated self powered\/battery operated, hardwired phone lines. A load dispatcher at a higher level on the grid would communicate by voice to the different substations and the tenders physically opened and closed the breakers. Elaborate systems had miles of control cable running back and forth supplying analog data and sometimes relay control to do the switching remotely. Some systems even used an analog version of \"digital\" control not unlike old dial telephones. That enabled one pair of copper lines to do multiple functions.\n\nPartly due to a desire to reduce manpower and partly to improve efficiency and response, things started shifting to electronics. The old electro-mechanical devices require enormous amounts of maintenance time, testing and adjusting. Early electronic devices required big clunky, dedicated terminals to do the interfacing and controlling functions. You needed at least one of these 100lb monsters at every control point. Still, systems required a fair amount of manpower and the amount of data and control that could be passed remotely was still limited. These early systems were still relatively local and a lot of human coordination was necessary between higher levels in the system. But the efficiency and performance made a grand leap from the time prior to using electronics.\n\nAs control advanced and became more complex you needed more sophisticated equipment. It went from coordinated descrete electronic devices to microprocessors. \"Portable\" computers started entering the scene and early \"laptops\" were control geek devices to access the new sophisticated equipment. In those days, these weren't Windows based operating systems. All the while, the power system was continually expanding and the needs and coordination was becoming more and more complex.\n\nThe size and complexity drove the development of true distributed control. No doubt some of the expansion was about eliminating people. Someone monitoring a station might spend most of their time recording meter readings and killing time. Maybe a couple times each day they might actually have to do something besides watching and waiting for trouble. It takes a lot of people at a lot of places to do this around the clock, 24hrs\/day. And when system become reliable, the humans involved tend to make mistakes when a rare crisis arrives.\n\nAt a point it became obvious and cost effective to use a standard PC as an interface device to the controllers. Still though, the controller processors operate on different and often obscure proprietary operating systems. But PCs are typically used as a programming interface and data can be sent back and forth between the controller's memory and other computers via a variety of network protocols.\n\nIn some original systems, there was very little in the way of security because the only people with access were the trained specialists who understood the systems and often the only interface was a proprietary device. In some cases you can make systems which are on their own dedicated local networks. This is in fact how the Iranian Uranium enrichment facility operated. It did not have a connection to the Internet. This idea works OK when there is no need for external communication to remote facilities. However, when data needs to be sent back and forth across many miles to remote locations, the Internet makes a useful tool for doing that. Yes, the money can be invested to make this a unique private network. However, often the machines that communicate with the controllers also can potentially be connecting to the Internet.\n\nStuxnet likely got into the system in Iran by a file on a Russian technician's infected laptop PC. It may have been planted there or even transmitted to him through an e-mail or some other Internet borne means. When you look at how many devices ultimately may have a connection to the controllers, it is extremely difficult to keep the outside world, completely out, even if the local controller network never make a direct connection to the Internet. Even with the most disciplined procedures it is very difficult to totally 100% block everything. It can be made extremely difficult, but making it foolproof is just making it more challenging.\n\nBut just getting access won't necessarily create havoc unless the person getting in has a good working knowledge of the controllers unique programs. To crash a system is one thing, but doing major damage takes a much higher level of expert knowledge. However, a lot of problems could potentially be caused by just by crashing these systems depending on the process it controls. Most big systems use the SCADA concept. \n\nThis is heavily used in the power grid, water treatment, pipelines and many industrial and infrastructure systems. Sometimes these are isolated form the Internet, but often they aren't. The inner workings are relatively obscure and not well known by those outside the industry. It takes special knowledge to figure these systems out and do specific actions. Your teenage hacker in the basement is not likely to create too big a mess here, but the nation based cyber attackers will have enough of the right people knowledgeable enough to do major damage. Still, depending on how well designed the system was in the first place can make a big difference. There are many systems out there running right now that never had much thought about security from the begining. Often these systems may have started out as totally isolated, but as companies get bought out or grow there is often a desire to link to these systems.\n\nThis just creates vulnerabilities. Some parts might be secure while others might be very weak. A weak point itself can serve as a path to other points in the system. So even though the network might be secure from the outside world, an attack could be launched from within the closed network. Think about unmanned facilities with relatively weak physical security.\n\nThis kind of infrastructure\/industrial attack is not the kind of thing for average hackers but for those with the right knowledge and the intent, it is entirely possible. Fixing the vulnerabilities isn't as easy as it sounds and may require a complete re-engineering of some systems. Things like the power grid are such a conglomeration of different technologies and different generations, that cleaning this up is a massive job. Parts of the grid in fact have equipment that is 100 years old and have been interfaced in some very unique ways. And there's an enormous amount of stuff that may be 30-40 years old, designed long before anybody even considered security.\n\nGet all American employees of the federal gov. including armed forces to flood the Chinese gov. web site at the same time. an hour latter, pick the largest company in china and do the same thing. they will either retaliate and cause the internet to be useless costing everybody tons of money, or they will get the point that they live in a glass house and should stop throwing stones.\n\nOr the pres can simply say, \"one more attack and we send every ship from china back to where it came from and start making our own cheap toys and cooking utensils.\"\n\nRefer to photo: WHY the heck is the Air Force guy wearing camouflage... INDOORS !! IN A SERVER RACK EQUIPMENT ROOM??? I thot these guys wear BLUE for indoors. The only indoor forest is made of non-camouflage CAT5 cable.\n\n**** The Main Point ****\n\nMy Fellow 'merkins, QUIT BUYING ITEMS MADE IN CHINA. That's ALL that needs to be said. I thot 'merka does not deal with Communist countries. (WTF ?!?)\n\n*** Secondary Point ***\n\nThe USA counter-hackers need to be clever enough to move Chinese money to pay off all debt owed to China, as \"paid-in-full\", and delete all historical debt info.\n\n\"countries\" might, but not the US. Our oligarchy of corporations own those pipes and they are getting filthy stinking rich selling out the rest of us. When the stuff hits the fan they'll simply buy an island off Panama and it's \"asta la vista baby\" to the ol USA. They will not look back.\n\nIf you really want to be creeped out, consider this: all our computer equipment, with little exception, is manufactured in China. The state of the art now is to be able to embed bad code in nanoparticles. While we tear our hair out defending against hacks and looking for their malware on servers, etc., it could actually be right there - in the hardware that China ships us - just waiting to be activated!\n\nTo the point that \"S. Williams-430936\" makes, there have been several recent reports about routers and computers that have back doors allowing Chinese advertising in. So far it has only been annoying and not taken very seriously but it is a real threat.\n\nOur single biggest problem is our own people know more about what is happening at the Oscars than they do about world events. This lack of knowledge will eventually criple us all.\n\nShades of Star Trek: The Next Generation - it seems the \"Borgs\" have come back to the past in order to save the US! LOL\n\nSeriously though, as comfortable we are with the internet and what we accomplish on it from information, banking, paying bills etc. If the cyber attacks infiltrate the economic infrastructure: electricity, transportation and so forth, there could be a lot of people dying such as air traffic control loses contact\/control with over 1000 aircraft over the US, the death toll would be astronomical.\n\nI bet you everythings got backup switches. Like so if they shut down the electric its not a big deal cause someone just needs to go out and turn all the switches back on manuely. So it would only be shut down for a hour and everybody can find something else to do for a hour besides being online.\n\nwhy on earth would we put our countries most valuable systems on the internet...that is just stupidity at its finest.\n\nAmericans, why are we so afraid of being unplugged? Mechanics work perfectly fine..no www needed. I feel bad for kids being born into a world that is played out on a screen over the www. How horrible is it for them to feel so \"shut out\" from the world if they cant log on...I remember the 80s, it was fun, we rode bikes and felt wind\n\nit wasn't until my facebook account was deleted (my choice) that my family\/friends call and ask if im ok......where do i live....what is \"going on\" in an emergency type voice of concern...my facebook...not a call from the emergency room or the jail...facebook!\n\nNot really. I wish it were as easy as turning on switches. Discovery, PBS, Frontline, or Dateline (sorry, I don't remember which) did a story on how vulnerable the power grid is. It still uses the same old infrastructure as it did decades ago. The problem is when power gets knocked out in one area, the now-excess power gets sent to other circuits which causes an overload and trips breakers, sending more excess power to more and more circuits. This is what happened a few years ago in New York.\n\nmost special (#5.1), from what I have learned this is how it kinda goes....im going to use a mmorpg as an example.\n\nWorld of Warcraft has hackers that will steal an entire group (aka guild) money (aka gold) which could lead to real money, in-game items (which are turned and sold for game or real $$), and much more...they get real kids to get their parents ccard and pay real $$ for in-game money, which was stolen to begin with from innocent players...the game industry does a lot to combat this..but it happens all the time..\n\nnow, just insert your bank and your entire family's accounts and we have a real world issue, not just a silly game problem.\n\nRoadlesstraveled you are absolutely correct. There are people who make their living playing WOW. I play and my account got hacked a two years back. Now on the flip side of that the security that Blizzard uses to protect actual account and credit information is much more secure. They took items off my charecters and the gold out of my banks but they did not get access to my credit card information.\n\nSo, did you buy plat, items, or use a levelling service? Or were you just foolish and didn't get an authenticator from Blizzard? I haven't played WoW in 3 years, and I had one 2 years before I quit. I still need it to play D3 and StarCraft2.\n\nIts like everything else. If we have it its good and if they have it its bad. As long as they don't steal my money thats in my bank acount then idc. But ima buy stamps soon for investing cause they go up in value fast then all my money wont be in the bank and i can just keep them in my room somewhere.\n\nWarren-1380094 Do not presume that all of any group is an idiot or a Nimrod, whatever you define that to be. I do admit, the US government's behavior and the citizens' opinions generally appear to be idiotic. However, I consider myself an exception. That is why I consider it my obligation to attempt to enlighten them, but ignorance abounds everywhere and I, by no means, would feel it wise to limit my efforts to one self-identified nationality or another. It is rampant nationalism that causes the human race to struggle against itself. Can you imagine what our world could be like if we eschewed destructive acts and sought to work together? Of course, this is idealistic but without becoming idealistic, our efforts will be as Shakespeare wrote: \"Life is but a poor player that struts and frets its hour upon the stage, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\"\n\nI think your comment helps explain why the old timers wrote the bible.They did the best they could at the time,but in this ever changing world it would be nice to have a more enlightened edition. Insanity begets insanity.\n\nThe government knew this for years. Hacking was going on for years look at the movie war games, I was hacking in the 70's and 80's before it became illegal again I wasnt out to cause trouble. Also look at the black hat conventions that are held in Vagas some of the greatest minds we have and they are noth backed by the government.\n\nLast week on NPR there was a story about how the military uses vulnerability of programs as an offensive weapon. The story said that originally when security people found a flaw they notified the software manufacturer. However the military said they (US military) could exploit the flaw as a weapon so they would not allow the researcher to tell the manufacturer. Of course the US is using a lot of the same software and if our guy could figure it out they could too. With information in real time we tend to micro-manage everything. In the old days the guy on the battle field was told to take an objective. How he did that was his problem. Who he killed was their problem. Of course that was the last war we won.\n\nAs programmer who stated in the late 70s I can tell you most of this is the fault of operating systems which are built for convenience and not security. I remember having many conversations with my peers on how downright stupid Windows is in this regard.\n\nTrue, in part. But, many attacks are the results of \"social engineering.\" They rely on the weak spot in the system architecture ... humans. All the security in the world if someone gives up their credentials to a caller claiming to be from their company's \"IT security department.\"\n\nI can assure you that important databases are not housed on windows servers.\n\nWhich leads to the point that these Unix\/Linux operating systems are not as secure as some people suggest. It is very possible to get viruses on these things but any system can be vulnerable to a human hacker on the other side.\n\nI can assure you that important databases are not housed on windows servers\n\nI can assure that many are, and also Unix has NEVER been considered all that secure. I used to work at a LARGE semi-conductor company and at one point I figured out a way log into about a third of all UNIXs accounts on our network.\n\nJane Fonda is a traitor. She should not portray Nancy Reagan nor should we support her book.America, we must not forget!Those of us that were living in those years will never forget that she was a traitor and did a lot of damage to our boys. She has now been chosen to play Nancy Reagan in her life story.I am sending this one out because so many do not know this truth... and also because she was on 3 times this week talking about her new book...And how good she feels in her 70'sBarbara Walters said: Thank you all. Many died in Vietnam for our freedoms. I did not like Jane Fonda then and I don't like her now. She can lead her present life the way she wants and perhaps SHE can forget the past, but we DO NOT have to stand by without comment and see her \"honored\" as a \"Woman of the Century.\" . NEVER FORGIVE A TRAITOR. SHE REALLY WAS A TRAITOR!! And now President OBAMA wants to honor her......!!!! A TRAITOR IS ABOUT TO BE HONORED. This is for all the kids born in the 70's and after who do not remember, and didn't have to bear the burden that our fathers, mothers and older brothers and sisters had to bear. Jane Fonda is being honored as one of the '100 Women of the Century.' BARBARA WALTERS WRITES: Unfortunately, many have forgotten and still countless others have never known how Ms. Fonda betrayed not only the idea of our country, but specific men who served and sacrificed during the Vietnam War. The He spat at Ms. Fonda, was clubbed, and was dragged away. During the subsequent beating, he fell forward on to the camp Commandant's feet, which sent that officer berserk. In 1978, the Air Force Colonel still suffered from double vision (which permanently ended his flying career) from the Commandant's frenzied application of a wooden baton. From 1963-65, Col. Larry Carrigan was in the 47FW\/DO (F-4E's). He spent 6 years in the ' Hanoi Hilton'...... At the end of the line and once the camera stopped rolling, to the shocked disbelief of the POWs, she turned to the officer in charge and handed him all the little pieces of paper... Three men died from the subsequent beatings. Colonel Carriganwas almost number four but he survived, which is the only reason we know of her actions that day. We were Jane Fonda's 'war criminals....' These first-hand experiences do not exemplify someone who should be honored as part of '100 Years of Great Women.' Lest we forget....' 100 Years of Great Women' should never include a traitor whose hands are covered with the blood of so many patriots.\n\nIf it is \"critical infrastructure\" then why is it connected to an open system like the internet, that can be hacked from anywhere in the world. As far as that, why would we use any piece of equipment on our critical infrastructure that was made in another country...especially China. I remember a few months ago when our government was taking bids from China for special computer equipment to be used in our defense systems and that is one of the most ignorant things I have ever heard.\n\nHey, why not use Chinese junk - after all, Bill Clinton paid off his election debt to the Chinese by selling them missile control technology - programming and hardware. So they can get in, either by hacking or by buying a politician.\n\nSeriously, do we need any further proof that it was stupid to send our manufacturing overseas, it is stupid to buy anything from overseas? Build it ourselves, if we can't build it, then do without until we CAN!\n\nI have been asking the same questions. There is no reason for critical infrastructure to have a connection to the internet and any computers in offices within those utilities that do have internet access should be ISOLATED from the computers that run the infrastructure. If networking is needed to run or maintain critical systems then it should be a NONPUBLIC secured network. Also, critical infrastructure systems should have physical access control rivaling the physical access control on nuclear weapons.\n\nSometimes I think the government wants this stuff to be open to attack or it is already more secure and this is some syops stuff, because disconnecting critical infrastructure systems from public access and tightly controlling physical access is a simple logical and effective countermeasure.\n\nWhy would the control system for a power plant or water treatment system need to have a connection on an insecure public network? Heck, why would the control systems need to be even connected to office computers in the same building that have internet access?\n\nI have worked around digital systems all my life and part of my job is digital security and I can tell you right now that the concept of isolation of a digital system from an attacker is vary well known. There are some companies and systems that, by their nature are always open to attack, like google and any other company that has systems that must be available to the public, but this just is not so for critical control systems.\n\nI have to wonder. Who was the first to trespass? Where will this lead to? What a waste of time and resources. Just another cause for alarm and concern. And Humans are thought of as being intelligent? Doesn't seem natural to me. I have learned to expect such things. Although I do not accept these acts as fair, reasonable, or otherwise. Just isn't a world of trust. Life goes on. Without sayin. Just sayin. I can't do anything about this. BUT! I won't do that. NO! I won't do that. NOPE.\n\nWhen I was in the U.S. Army, I was responsible for cryptographic computers ( MOS 32G ) on the AUTODIN secure communications system. This was the system that allowed classified material to be transmitted worldwide. No one hacked the AUTODIN system.\n\nAnything you publish to the internet is public information. You may think you can make an unsecure system secure by encrypting the information. Obviously, that doesn't work. The only way to be sure that the information you are storing\/transmitting is secure is on a secure system.\n\nImagine that...and our bonehead president wants to cut everything under \"His\" plan!.. he once again blames congress, and it's his plan....Wake up America and hold this human accountable...It's ok that he won the election...now how about being a President and quit destroying my country!media knew Fear sells articles, and anti-virus software vendors knew this type of news sell their software. If you don't know that, you are their perfect target.\n\nThe cut in defense budget is about to kick in, you can expect this type of news will pop up more often. Russia used to be the stand in bad guy. Now, china is getting big, so china replaces russia as the bad guy, but the plot is still the same.\n\nUntil we as a nation get our priorities realigned or this is a lost war. Our government gives tax breaks to companies to relocate to China and other countries. No jobs here means no money to support education, which leads to lower standards. The public won't approve and extra $100\/year in school taxes but will gladly pay $300\/month for cell phone service. We pay athletes millions of dollars but vilify teachers as lazy and overpaid when they hold the keys to our nations future. We as a nation need to rethink some things and realize we are sowing the seeds of our own demise"}

{"text":"Lawmakers are split over the question of whether attacking another country's computer networks and websites constitute an act of war. The debate follows accusations that Russia was behind attacks on Georgian government sites (including that of President Mikhail Saakashvili, pictured) shortly before launching military action.\n\nThe attacks were simplistic denial of service attacks, which involve sending repeated requests to a server until it seizes up and makes the associated computers and websites inaccessible. They left Georgian officials struggling to communicate with the world electronically during the fighting with Russian troops.\n\nIt's not yet confirmed who is behind the attacks. While they obviously helped Russia, the country's government is denying any involvement. Subsequent attacks have resembled previous attacks pinned on the Russian Business Network, a major criminal gang. However, it's not clear if they are responsible this time (it could be other parties copying their techniques) or, if they did carry out the attacks, whether they did so with government knowledge or backing.\n\nSome analysts have compared the attacks with previous cyber-assaults on Estonia which were less intense but continued over a longer period. That may suggest the attacks on Georgia are the work of private individuals with less powerful computers.\n\nWith such assaults in the news, The Washington Post has now confirmed that neither the US government nor the Pentagon has an official stance on whether such attacks are an act of war, which could affect the legality of any response, both by the US alone and by NATO partners.\n\nIronically the Russian government has previously called for a ban on cyber-attacks as part of arms control deals, but the US government refused.\n\nIt seems the lack of US policy is largely because cyber-warfare falls into a grey area, with no government department or agency specifically responsible. But it's not just a US problem: international military law is also unclear about the problem."}

Also, come up with a plan. Assign roles to team members, who does the recon? etc. Ensure you have a good mix of skills in your team like reversing, web app testing and coding.\n\nSo our motley band of 4 players set about the challenges. The organisers had created a list of questions which if answered correctly proved that you had completed a challenge. The challenges themselves were split into the following:\n\nOverall, we placed 2nd only 1% behind the winning team. Congratulations to the winning team, who by the way have won for the 2nd year in a row. I look forward to see you all next year at the competition."}

{"text":"The lack of an international agreement on cybercrime and terrorism is thwarting efforts to bring terrorists to justice, said a report released this week by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\n\nNations should consider a universal agreement requiring countries to cooperate with each other during cybercrime and cyberterrorism investigations, the report said.\n\nThe absence of such an agreement \"is an impediment to effective international cooperation in some terrorism-related investigations and prosecutions,\" the report said. An agreement should impose \"specific obligations\" on nations.\n\nThe report, focused on cyberterrorism, said terrorist groups are using the internet to distribute propaganda to recruit members and to incite violence, the report said. The internet \"makes it easy for an individual to communicate with relative anonymity, quickly and effectively across borders, to an almost limitless audience\".\n\nThe report is designed to provide practical guidance for the investigation and prosecution of internet terrorism cases, said NODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov.\n\n\"Just as internet use among regular, lawful citizens has increased in the past few years, terrorist organisations also make extensive use of this indispensable global network for many different purposes,\" he said.\n\nSeveral cybersecurity groups and experts contacted about the report said they either weren't aware of it or hadn't reviewed it.\n\nBut Jim Dempsey, vice president for public policy at the Center for Democracy and Technology, called the report \"one-sided.\"\n\nThe report \"gives very little attention to the negative impact on privacy, free speech and other rights that can arise from the misuse of cybercrime and cyberterrorism powers,\" he said. \"The report selectively surveys the world's laws, tending to pick the more draconian and intrusive provisions from any given country, without providing any context, either as to how the more democratic countries limit these laws with judicial controls and oversight or how these laws are misused to limit dissent in less democratic countries.\"\n\nDempsey called the report disappointing in \"how little attention it gives to human rights.\" Government officials should not use the report as a \"reliable guide\" on efforts to fight cyberterrorism, he added.\n\nMuch of the 158-page report describes established practices for fighting cyberterrorism in the US, UK and other countries that have successfully prosecuted such cases. But the report includes several recommendations.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies should work with Internet service providers to collect \"key evidence\" in cyberterrorism cases, the report recommended. \"While some countries, such as Egypt, have implemented legislation requiring ISPs to identify users before allowing them Internet access, similar measures may be undertaken by ISPs on a voluntary basis,\" the report said.\n\nOperators of Wi-Fi networks and cybercaf\u00e9s should consider requiring users to register and identify themselves, the report recommended.\n\nThe UN report also recommends governments put policies in place, including outlawing terrorist activity online and regulating ISPs. The report didn't recommend specific policies in some areas, although it noted that efforts to impose monitoring requirements on internet caf\u00e9s in some countries may not be useful if terrorists continue to have access to other forms of public Internet access, including airport and library Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\nIn addition, governments should maintain human rights protections, the report said. \"The issue of the extent to which governments should regulate terrorism-related content on the Internet is problematic, requiring the balancing of law enforcement and human rights considerations"}

According to Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at security firm F-Secure, the claim is a logical conclusion to a series of recent discoveries and disclosures linking the U.S. government to 2010's Stuxnet attack on Iran and ties between Stuxnet and the recent Flame attack. 'It's plausible that if there is an operation under way and being run by a U.S. intelligence agency it would make perfect sense for them to plant moles inside Microsoft to assist in pulling it off, just as they would in any other undercover operation,' he said. 'It's not certain, but it would be common sense to expect they would do that.'\"\n\nImagine a government with access to a complex OS source code. Then imagine that they get data on all manner of security holes as they are discovered. Imagine also that this government has access to OS security update certifications. Finally, imagine that this same government has the ability to hack into server DNS tables to route targeted users to their alternative 'security updates'.\n\nThe penetration of any software company by undercover government operatives would hardly be surprising, but entirely unnecessary. Microsoft would hardly be alone as a target of such espionage -- every software company would be vulnerable, including OSS. There is also the issue with 'backdoors' hard-wired into computer hardware, including especially telecom systems. IIRC, this became an issue recently with news of backdoors alleged to exist in VLSI circuits manufactured in China. Older news alleged that Israel also puts backdoors into the telecom hardware they sell & ship, including to the USA government.\n\nIf virtually every government does such spying, including upon their own citizens, and any number of software & hardware companies do the same with their customers, any cautious user of such technology should be aware of the potential security breaches they expose themselves to every time they connect to the internet, or open their front door for that matter. Redundancy & breadth of security beats security through obscurity any day.\n\nThe phrases of the day are, \"Trust no one\", \"Security in depth\", and \"If it can't be accessed remotely, it's more secure & less vulnerable\". At that point, physical security & Tempest-hardening secure your valuable data. The rhetorical question is, \"How valuable is your data if you cannot readily access it?\" I found it humorous that the USA government recently wanted reporters to write their news stories on government-supplied computers, if only to avoid unwanted data leaks & stop potential whistleblowers in their tracks.\n\nTrust the USA government, or any government, or any corporation with an agenda? Why take that risk unmitigated? And who in Hades would put vulnerable sensitive SCADA systems in close proximity to the Internet except an idiot?"}

{"text":"42.3.1.1. Shades of Gray\n\nWithin the community of individuals who find and exploit vulnerabilities in systems and networks are several distinct groups. These groups are often described by the shade of hat that they \"wear\" when performing their security investigations and this shade is indicative of their intent.\n\nThe white hat hacker is one who tests networks and systems to examine their performance and determine how vulnerable they are to intrusion. Usually, white hat hackers crack their own systems or the systems of a client who has specifically employed them for the purposes of security auditing. Academic researchers and professional security consultants are two examples of white hat hackers.\n\nA black hat hacker is synonymous with a cracker. In general, crackers are less focused on programming and the academic side of breaking into systems. They often rely on available cracking programs and exploit well known vulnerabilities in systems to uncover sensitive information for personal gain or to inflict damage on the target system or network.\n\nThe gray hat hacker, on the other hand, has the skills and intent of a white hat hacker in most situations but uses his knowledge for less than noble purposes on occasion. A gray hat hacker can be thought of as a white hat hacker who wears a black hat at times to accomplish his own agenda.\n\nGray hat hackers typically subscribe to another form of the hacker ethic, which says it is acceptable to break into systems as long as the hacker does not commit theft or breach confidentiality. Some would argue, however, that the act of breaking into a system is in itself unethical.\n\nRegardless of the intent of the intruder, it is important to know the weaknesses a cracker may likely attempt to exploit.

{"text":"Why So Many Websites Have Been Down Lately\n\nMultitudes of websites have been down or unavailable since the summer of 2010 due to an increase in various cyber attacks against certain websites or entire host servers. Here's a little bit of news about what's behind all of this and ways you can protect your website from being hacked.\n\nIn early December 2010, Graham Cluley reported on Naked Security that \"a number of websites have been struck by DDoS attacks, seemingly co-ordinated by supporters of WikiLeaks against firms and websites who they feel have turned their back on the controversial whistle-blowing website.\"\n\nOn that same day, the Huffington Post reported that Mastercard and a Swiss Bank went down due to those same attacks too.\n\nWhat's it Called?\n\nA DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service) is when a bunch of computers gang up on another computer or host server and cause a traffic jam so big that it results in grid lock. It not only affects the site they are attacking, it can bring whole server networks to a crawl. Mass cyber attacks happen all the time. The news cited above is one of the few you ever hear about.\n\nMost website owners participate in what is known as shared hosting. Think of it like a filing cabinet. A folder with your site files is placed in a drawer along with other folders. The whole cabinet is the host's server, or big hard drive. If one of the folders in that cabinet is attacked, it could adversely affect the rest of the folders too.\n\nMost big companies, like Mastercard are on what's known as dedicated servers. In other words, they own the whole filing cabinet, but it still may be located in what are called server farms with lots of other filing cabinets hooked to the same backbone, or Internet gateway. So, while an attacker can't get to Mastercard's filing cabinet directly, they may be able to get to one of the others on that farm and clog the gate for anyone else to get in or out.\n\nFor maximum security, most governments own their server farms and the equipment that provides the gateway, but at some point, those lines do go out into the world at large, and that's where hackers try to slip in.\n\nProtect Yourself\n\nTo accomplish a distributed attack, hackers need lots of computers to overwhelm another computer. Most hosts have security measures in place to fend off such intrusions, but with shared hosting, every folder in the cabinet can be a way in for a hacker if each site does not take proper security measures for itself.\n\nYou can increase your site security to ensure that a hacker can't slip some code onto your site and have it involuntarily participate in the attack by keeping your WordPress files, plugins, and theme up-to-date. You can have a qualified geek check your WordPress installation for security holes. And, you can install a few extra security plugins.\n\nMass cyber attacks are on the rise. Hosting companies are in a 24\/7 battle to keep them from affecting your site. So, help them out by keeping your files updated and encourage everyone you know who owns a site to do the same[...] hackers can clog the pipeline on any server so that nothing can get out (read Why so Many Websites Have Been Down Lately),you would think that they would take every precaution necessary to secure WordPress installations.

It may have been the result of infection by one of the high-profile state-sponsored computer viruses which has been discovered in the Middle East in recent months - such as Flame and Gauss - or if it was one of millions of pieces of computer malware found on the internet.\n\nFOLLOW IBTIMES\n\nFollowing the attack, a group of hackers identifying themselves as the Arab Group Youth claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had disrupted \"the infrastructure and management systems in the oil company Aramco\" in order to warn the Saudi government and in particular the House of Saud, the ruling royal family of Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, the group has no way to verify its claim, but adds in its Pastebin posting that, if the Saudi government continue to \"betray the nation,\" it will face more severe action.\n\nDespite Saudi Aramco having to isolate its systems, the company confirmed the integrity of all of its electronic network and added the interruption had no impact whatsoever on any of the company's production operations.\n\n\"The company employs a series of precautionary procedures and multiple redundant systems within its advanced and complex system that are used to protect its operational and database systems.\"\n\nSaudi Aramco IT experts said they were anticipate resuming normal operations of its network soon."}
{"text":"Alleged Mariposa Botnet Developer Appears in Slovenian Court\n\n26-year-old Slovenian Matjaz \u0160korjancu, known on the hacking scene as Iserdo, has appeared in a Maribor District Court, being accused of developing the software behind the Mariposa botnet. The suspect's former girlfriend, Nusa \u010coh, also stands trial, facing money laundering accusations.\n\nBack in 2010, when authorities from Slovenia, Spain and the US arrested the suspected operators and developers of Mariposa (butterfly in Spanish), they estimated that as many as 12 million computers might have been part of the botnet.\n\nNow, according to Slovenske Novice, Matjaz \u0160korjancu is accused of creating the program and selling it to 233 individuals. Court documents reveal that the damage caused by the botnet is around 3.3 million EUR ($3.7 million).\n\nThe money he made after selling the malicious code, around 115,000 EUR ($142,000), was placed in the bank account of Nusa \u010coh, who was his girlfriend at the time.\n\nThe 26-year-old doctor claims that she doesn't have any involvement in her former boyfriend's crimes. She stated that back in 2007, when they met, he told her that he was a computer programmer and allegedly asked her to deposit the money in her account for tax benefits.\n\nShe is accused of assisting \u0160korjancu in laundering the money he earned.\n\nThe defense claims that the suspect has nothing to do with the malicious software. In the upcoming hearings, the prosecution will present all 6,000 pages of evidence it has against \u0160korjancu.\n\nThe United States have requested the man to be extradited, but so far Slovenian authorities haven't agreed to do so.\n\nIt doesn't happen too often to see a botnet developer behind bars, so it will be interesting to see if authorities can come up with enough evidence against \u0160korjancu to get him convicted."}

{"text":"Ethical Hacking?\n\nThis is a discussion on Ethical Hacking? within the A Brief History of Cprogramming.com forums, part of the Community Boards category; So I read this, and I thought \"Is this serious!?!?!?!\"\nthis...\n\nEthical Hacking?\n\nI don't really see anything wrong with this. Hacking in the security sense is simply finding security holes in systems. This course could have been named \"secure coding practices\" to attract less negative publicity.\n\nRegardless, these students will learn how to use modern hacking techniques in order to create and maintain security systems. It's not novel by any means. Many companies already employ so-called hackers. In fact, you have to know about hacking in order to effectively protect against unauthorized access and use.\n\nI agree with Quantum1204 - the wording is obviously attracting negative publicity. Considering how easy it would have been to avoid this negative publicity, I am skeptical of the competence of the program's administrators.\n\nThe hacking versus cracking argument all over again. After so much virtual ink has been spilt over this, and we still have people confusing both words... *sigh*\n\nHas major_small said those definitions are wrong. The term has been abused all over the years and is now mostly widespread. Escpecially by the media. They are the biggest culprits on the destruction of a perfectly acceptable word. You would have to be around during late 80s and early 90s to understand exactly what I am talking about.\n\nThere is such a thing as ethical hacking. Capiche?\nMany companies hire people to get into their system, exploits their weaknesses and then build the needed security measures.\n\nDefinitions change, people. If the majority of the world thinks that hacking refers to illegally gaining access to or control of a computer system, who gives a crap what Webster says? People who use the word 'hacking' and are appalled when people misunderstand them need to work on their communication skills."}
{"text":"CyberCity lets government hackers train to thwart attacks\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 CyberCity has all the makings of a regular town. There's a bank, a hospital and a power plant. A train station operates near a water tower. The coffee shop offers free WiFi.\n\nBut only certain people can get in: government hackers preparing for battles in cyberspace.\n\nThe town is a virtual place that exists only on computer networks run by a New Jersey-based security firm working under contract with the Air Force. Computers simulate communications and operations, including email, heating systems, a railroad and an online social networking site\n\nTo those who participate in the practice missions, the digital activity will look and feel real. The \"city\" will have more than 15,000 \"people\" who have email accounts, work passwords and bank deposits. The power plant has employees. The hospital has patients. The coffee shop's customers will come and go, using the insecure WiFi system, just as in real life.\n\nTo reinforce the real-world consequences of cyberattacks, CyberCity will have a tabletop scale model of the town, including an electric train, a water tower and a miniature traffic light that will show when they have been attacked.\n\n\"It might look to some people like a toy or game,\" Ed Skoudis, founder of Counter Hack, the security firm in central New Jersey that is developing the project, said recently while giving a reporter a tour of the fledgling system. \"But cyberwarriors will learn from it.\"\n\nCyberCity provides insight into some of the Pentagon's closely guarded plans for cyberwar. It also reflects the government's growing fears about the vulnerabilities of the computers that run the nation's critical infrastructure. Last month, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that digital attacks \"could be as destructive as the terrorist attack on 9\/11\" and virtually paralyze the country.\n\n\"If a crippling cyberattack were launched against our nation, the American people must be protected,\" he said. \"And if the commander in chief orders a response, the Defense Department must be ready to obey that order and to act.\"\n\nTroublesome fears\n\nBehind those fears is an unsettling reality: Networks in the United States will remain vulnerable to attacks for some time to come because no one understands cyberspace well enough to ensure security.\n\nIn the four decades since the Internet began, most cybersecurity research has been conducted on the fly or as an afterthought, according to interviews with security specialists and computer scientists. Now, with the world linking up its communications, infrastructure, military, banking, medical and other systems at a lightning pace, the dynamic of cyberspace has grown too complex. Rigorous scientific experimentation that might lead to security breakthroughs is only beginning.\n\nIn the meantime, attackers hold a huge advantage. They can choose the time, place and method of strikes. Defenders almost always have to settle for reacting, making fixes after the damage has been done.\n\nCyberCity aims to prepare government hackers to hold their own until long-term solutions can be found.\n\n\"The problem is the bad guys are getting better much faster than we are,\" Skoudis said. \"We don't want to fall further behind on this.\"\n\nCyberCity is one of hundreds of virtual environments \u2014 often known as cyber ranges or test beds \u2014 launched in recent years by military, corporate and academic researchers to confront the mind-bending security challenges posed by cyberspace, where millions of attacks or intrusions occur every day.\n\nSome small ranges study the effects of malicious software and viruses. Some hope to emulate the Internet itself and become scientific instruments of sorts, akin to mountaintop telescopes or particle accelerators, that will enable researchers to seek out the elusive fundamentals of cyberspace. The most ambitious of these, the National Cyber Range, was developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. It has cost about $130 million since 2008. The agency said seven large-scale experiments have been conducted by Pentagon researchers.\n\nCreating realistic virtual environments is extraordinarily challenging. In cyberspace, a global network of networks, more than 2 billion people interact with at least 12 billion computers and devices, including global positioning systems, mobile phones, satellites, data routers, ordinary desktop computers and industrial control computers that run power plants, water systems and more.\n\nIn many cyber ranges, the simulated Web servers, routers, mobile phones and other network devices operate essentially as they do in the real world, but they have few if any physical components. The virtual devices simply exist as computer code.\n\nMerit Network, a nonprofit technology group in Michigan, just launched a cyber range at Eastern Michigan University that promises to conduct \"live fire\" exercises. The Defense Department runs the Information Assurance Range in Stafford County, Va. It gives cyberwarriors a safe, closed environment to practice intrusions and security testing.\n\nIn Hampshire, England, and Millersville, Md., Northrop Grumman runs cyber ranges that allow corporate and government clients in Britain and the United States to create models of their own networks and employee activity. Northrop officials liken their systems to flight simulators.\n\nChristopher Valentino, a research and development director in the cyberintelligence division of Northrop Grumman Information Systems, said one key to a successful range is closely approximating the way human psychology plays out on real networks.\n\n\"It's very hard to find 'normal,'\" he said.\n\nCreating CyberCity\n\nThe idea for CyberCity grew out of conversations that Skoudis had two years ago with senior Air Force officials eager to convey to cyberwarriors the impact that hacking can have on real-world operations such as water plants and power grids.\n\nAt the time, the Pentagon had recently declared cyberspace the newest domain of war. U.S. forces also had secretly launched cyberattacks against Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, disabling almost 1,000 uranium centrifuges in 2009 and 2010. That attack, disclosed this year, involved a malicious computer \"worm\" known as Stuxnet. It is the most notable attack on critical infrastructure that has come to light.\n\nSkoudis ran a network-hacking training program called NetWars through the SANS Institute, a leading security organization that has trained thousands of government and civilian employees. Working through SANS, he agreed to create CyberCity for less than $1 million. It would be a modest range with an urgent, focused goal.\n\n\"We're not trying to do a lot of theoretical work here,\" Skoudis said. \"Our focus is on very practical applications, training cyberwarriors.\"\n\nThe Air Force believes that training on cyber ranges is a key to keeping pace with changing threats from criminals, terrorists or even nation-states. The practice missions in CyberCity are expected to begin in the next few weeks."}
{"text":"At this event, you will get an elaborate insight into the current landscape of cyber threats. In the area of IT security, there is a clear transformation in progress. At the outset, cyber crime was dominated by hobbyists whose main motivation was being recognized for their skills and achievements. Now, the market is experiencing a highly organized, professional, criminal and malicious global threat with motivations ranging from the financial to the political spectrum.\n\nThis transition calls for a fundamental change in attitudes towards IT security, especially for governments. The criminals and hacktivists are more strategic and patient investing more time and money to achieve their objectives. Government IT security can no longer be treated as an afterthought or inconvenience. Instead, it needs to be discussed and implemented on a highly strategic level, due to the critical and sensitive nature of the information being exchanged. In addition to ensuring the safe exchange of critical and strategic information, governments need to be able to guarantee the privacy of citizens and protect the sensitive personal information citizens provide them."}

The championship is a computer security competition where students from different schools are pitted against one another on the web. Each team builds a website and then a group of industry experts try to hack into it. \"They are meeting the demands of assimilated management, they have to change some things in the infrastructure and they are trying to keep everything working at the same time,\" says Peter Lutz, a professor of systems and security administration at RIT. Sunday's competition represented colleges across the northeast including RIT, Syracuse University and Northeastern University. The winner will advance to the national cyber defense competition in April."}
{"text":"What would you do if you found out, as you were getting on your next flight, that the airplane's ice detector probe, which detects the buildup of ice on the aircraft's exterior, contains a critical electronic part that was not new when installed, but instead may have been salvaged from an old plane. Many people would consider getting off and driving or taking a train instead. Sounds impossible or even farfetched \u2013 but it is more than possible, according to a recent report from the Senate Armed Services Committee that highlights the risk that counterfeit electronic components pose to military systems.\n\nWhile the report focuses on the risks posed to military systems, there is no reason to believe that the risks are any different for non-military systems. Indeed, the report cited an example in which an aircraft manufacturer installed ice detection modules that were suspected to be counterfeit on seven commercial aircraft. Even after being informed of the possible counterfeit nature of the part, the company determined that no immediate action was required. While the company acknowledged that the \"components may have somewhat lower reliability,\" it concluded that \"the engineering consensus is that the units can remain on the airplane and be repaired on an attrition basis.\"\n\nThe problem of counterfeit goods is not new. Unscrupulous manufacturers and vendors have long realized that they can earn tremendous profits by selling counterfeit or reused products as originals. In many instances, counterfeit products are easy to spot and, while not okay, do not pose a health and safety threat. That great deal on a Rolex for $100 probably was, actually, really not that great of a deal. Caveat emptor.\n\nHowever, counterfeiting is no longer limited to just high-end consumer products. Pharmaceutical companies have been warning of the health risks posed by counterfeit drugs for many years, and despite their best efforts, the problem may be getting worse and not better. It is conservatively estimated that such products cost U.S. businesses billions of dollars a year in losses. The Senate Armed Services Committee report highlights the risk that counterfeit electronic parts pose to military systems and, by extension to non-military systems as well.\n\nThe report identified approximately 1,800 cases of suspected counterfeit parts in the defense supply chain in 2009 and 2010. However, in only 15 percent of these cases were reports of suspected counterfeit parts submitted to the Government Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP), which was set up as a system to inform suppliers about counterfeit parts and help in their removal. Much of the report is devoted to a number of \"Case Studies,\" which illustrate the complexity of the counterfeit parts problem and the potential harm that the military can suffer in mission readiness.\n\nIn addition, to the ice detection system involving the aircraft described above, the report also examined, in great detail, counterfeit part incidents involving the Navy SH-60B helicopters and P-8A aircraft and the Air Force's C-130J and C-27J aircraft. In the case of the Air Force C-130J, the manufacturer of a display unit, L-3 Communications, that provide the pilot with information on the health of the airplane, including engine status, fuel use, location and warning messages, which supplies the display to Lockheed Martin, which is the prime contractor, detected that L-3's in-house failure rate for a chip installed on display units had more than tripled to 27%. The testing concluded that the parts were \"suspect counterfeit.\" Failure of the memory chip could cause a display unit to show a degraded image, lose data, or even go blank altogether. Testing by an independent company confirmed the suspect nature of the part.\n\nL-3, however, failed to notify its customers that the suspect chips should be returned for replacement. In November 2010, when L-3 notified Lockheed Martin, the Air Force's prime contractor on the C-130J about the issue, L-3 identified more than 400 assemblies affected by the suspect counterfeit memory chips. According to the report, after being notified of the situation, Lockheed Martin discussed the situation internally and concluded that there is \"no short term increase in risk\" and nothing to be done from an operational perspective,\" but stated that \"the solution to the issue is quite long-term.\" Lockheed Martin also agreed to monitor the failure rate of the display units and report the findings to the Air Force. However, at the time of the publication of the Senate report, Lockheed Martin's findings were incomplete.\n\nAmong the report's conclusions is that \"China is the dominant source country for counterfeit electronic parts that are infiltrating the defense supply chain.\" The report further concluded that \"the Chinese government has failed to take steps to stop counterfeiting operations that are carried out openly in that country.\" In contrast to the clean room operations at a U.S. semiconductor facility, in which the air is 1000 times cleaner that that found in a hospital operating room because even a tiny particle of dust can negatively impact a device, some of the semiconductor manufacturing operations in China are downright filthy.\n\nThe report contains a description of a visit to Shantou's electronic counterfeiting district where used electronic parts are washed in a river, dried on the riverbank, and sorted by women and children on the sidewalk after they have been naturally washed in the July monsoon rains. They are then collected into \"plastic bins filled with expensive brand name components and harvested from scrap printed circuit boards ready for processing90% of American independepent brokers who supply military and other industrial grade semiconductor are associated and affiliated with ERAI, a network who provides profitability network, support, escrow while dealing with Chinese flea market.\n\nLow level inspections limited to cosmetic microscopic, are carried out to approve the parts which gets into supply chain through this network called ERAI which is based at NAPLES Florida. Many of non-VAT chinese suppliers are also part of ERAI association.\n\nThis association often boast of anti-counterfeiting while getting cuts & subscription from all these substandard brokers in America.\n\nThese pirated and fake military parts gets into military equipments, fighter jets, navigation and other guided missiles etc. Many counterfeits have been discovered in exported military parts by USA to various countries. If US wants to get rid of fake and counterfeits they must change their legal system to grab these culprits. In its history only one ERAI affiliate called Vision tech ( Shannon Wren ) has been caught with 16 million dollar worth of fake military parts. There are many more companies like Visiontech who are working under the protection of ERAI bosses Kristal Snider, Mark Snider, Terry Liverly , openly trade counterfeits. Many have been reported in inter broker community, but they have been either protected by this strong mafia or loopholes in local legal system. Few companies who have been caught red handed are Global Solutions Electronics , USBID, NASCO, New Advantage, all in Florida and couple of others like AERI, IDENTEK, who are based at California.\n\nRose Electronics, Florida, Oxygen Electronics, 1 source Electronics ( chip checker),Tytronix aka Epic International and V&C Technologies Inc are well known Chinese list brokers who are closely related to Kristal Snider. ERAI bosses themselves had a component company in Plymouth, who has closed their operations after being caught in big counterfeit merchandise originated from China. ERAI had couple of hidden operations in Mainland China, Hongkong and over 300 members locally who have supplied millions worth of military counterfeits.\n\nThe formation of the USNC\/IECQ Distributor's Advisory Group (\"DAG\") was driven by the lack of International Conformity Assessment within the Defense & Aerospace industry with regards to counterfeit components entering the supply chain. Lloyd Condra, Chairman of the USNC\/IECQ IAB, Convener TC 107 and Senior Technical Fellow The Boeing Company, was instrumental in forming USNC\/IECQ DAG. As Chairman of the USNC\/IECQ IAB, which the DAG operates under, Lloyd Condra understands the national and international network in which the IEC IECQ System operates.\n\nThe other groups you mentioned have been an instrumental contributor to the ongoing counterfeit mitigation dialogue. However, in order to truly combat the severity and global nature of the counterfeit epidemic, we felt that the issue needed to be addressed at an international level.\n\nProducing, implementing and performing conformity assessment on new international standards is a monumental task. SAE has done the heavy lifting with respect to producing the new AS5553 and AS6081 standards. The G-19 group will ultimately let industry choose which conformity assessment program to use. Once SAE releases the AS6081 & AS5553 standards, any certification body can certify to these new accepted standards.\n\nThe other groups you mentioned, such as IDEA & CCAP-101, have developed certification systems of their own. Whereas, DAG is aligned with the USNC\/IECQ, who have extensive experience implementing and overseeing international conformity assessment standards. DAG's strategic partnership with USNC\/IECQ will provide DAG members with direct access to an independent and internationally recognized standards organization. Having USNC\/IECQ as a resource will be critical as DAG members seek to conform with and implement the new AS6081 standard.\n\nThrough the support of the IEC, whose membership consists of more than 60 participating countries, DAG was formed and the mission was clear. Specifically, the mission of DAG is to work in tandem with USNC\/IECQ to create and implement a credible international certification process that results in safe, reliable and authentic components entering the supply chain.\n\nWe can have many standards written by many interested parties and stakeholders, or we can band together to create a single internationally accepted standard. DAG members will have access to ANSI\/USNC activities, will participate in national and international IEC IECQ activities and will work to form the International Counterfeit Avoidance Mark Alliance Corporation.\n\nDAG is a unique, strategic and forward-thinking group. Distributors must be part of the counterfeit avoidance conversation. DAG, by aligning with USNC\/IECQ, has positioned itself as an important voice and partner in the effort to protect the supply chain from counterfeits."}

{"text":"Long before Sept. 11, 2001, federal, state, and local law enforcement officers and investigators shared information with respect to active and pending threats. They developed intelligence about the bad guys - what they looked like, how they acted, where they liked to go - and quietly assembled profiles that helped them do their jobs. Clearly, after 9\/11, these efforts expanded exponentially, with much of the attention directed towards homeland security.\n\nThere will always be an ongoing debate over the effectiveness of such initiatives. But it is comforting to note that the number of terrorism plots foiled in the United States since 9\/11 ranged from nearly 30 to 45, depending upon which published estimate you're reading.\n\nSo, if we've had this degree of success in countering the terrorist groups, why can't we do better when it comes to stopping \"bad guys\" in cyberspace?"}
{"text":"I agree. I'm not quite getting how you're making the leap you appear to be making here. How exactly did this work? How do you know they used public cloud services? It's quite alarmist and without more detail, I'm not sure what to make of it. I agree with others that the New York Times details are sketchy at best. We know that New York Times reporters have been manipuated by government officials in the past to carry out their own agendas. I don't see any real evidence pointing to Iran. I don't see anything solid beyond some unamed sources trying to raise alarms. I'm surprised that you're so quick to believe it without more concrete evidence to support the claim.\n\nFrankly, Lin, who knows what they're doing? Certainly the US government seems to have devoted resources to cyber exploits directed against Iran (Stuxnet, Flame). Perhaps they didn't invest enough in preparing for retaliation.\n\n... unnamed \"government officials\" are saying the attacks are the work of Iran, \"most likely in retaliation for economic sanctions and online attacks by the United States\"\n\n@Kim - so if these unnamed officials are so on top of it as to know who is behind the attacks, and their motives, why did they lack the technology or foresight to block these attacks to begin with. I would rather they spend less time on identifying a culprit and disecting their motives, and spend more time speculating the where and how of the next attack and protecting against it.\n\n@Kim Davis: If the lobby has business support, would said businesses re-think their stances considering the victims in this case were all big business themselves? Pardon me if I mix metaphors, but as soon as shoes start hitting financial fans there's a different reaction to the drops.\n\nI'm afraid you probably are. I don't mean this to be perceived as a partisan comment, but I think the perception that Congress has, as its prime objective, stopping the \"other side\" doing stuff is fair.\n\nThe Senate lobby which has been blocking goverment oversight of the infrastructure has plenty of business support"}

{"text":"I wanna say it was in 2001, I think. This guy wrote a perl script that scanned ip ranges for computers with unprotected passwords, then used it to hack a bunch of US government computers at the cia and nasa. Supposedly found a bunch of interesting stuff regarding aliens which he has talked about, and about 9\/11 which he refuses to. He got caught and the US has been trying to get him ever since. His lawyer has been playing the Aspergers angle the entire time.\n\nBut to summarize, Gary was politicized by the Disclosure Project in 2001. He wanted to verify the claim that NASA routinely photoshops UFOs from their space photography before publicly releasing the images. I believe you're right about the complexity of his attack: he was basically remotely screen controlling systems with default or no passwords, and he did this in the middle of the night.\n\nGary claims to have found \"before\" or \"pre processed\" images containing massive craft. He has not released any saved copies he may have managed to get.\n\nI personally love that the US is claiming Gary did $700,000 in damage, which I believe is the minimum amount of damage required to justify extradition.\n\nImplying that they wouldn't have needed to fix those glaring security holes if it wasn't for this pesky McKinnon guy. =S Shame the UK judge didn't sanity check the damages claimI don't see why not. He just needs to run up the bill a few billion and not only will the police just give up, they will declare him too big to fail.\n\nTranslation: We got the idiots who left their systems unsecured to change their passwords to something slightly more secure and rode the Military Industrial Complex Gravy Train all the way to the bank.\n\nI hate to have to be the one to break it to you, but at 26 years old, I'm finding my generation to be just as technologically handicapped as the older ones, if not more so. Sure, they can use an iPhone and facebook, but they really have no idea about anything beyond that. Anyone who's worked in IT will be able to support me here.\n\nThis is the reason i thining about voting for the pirate party. Not because i some much agree with their views on copyright, but having some people in power that know the difference between email and TCP\/IP would be nice.\n\nThank you for that. The common folk know no more about computers than they did in 1980. People who decide to take a personal interest in computers and how they function are the only ones in society who have an effing clue about even the most basic functions. I would argue that young people today know even less than previous generations because design is so efficiently targeted to the lowest common denominator.\n\nActually, those of us born in the 70s and 80s generally have a pretty good grasp of how all this works, because we were around (and old enough) when it was all being developed and getting more sophisticated.\n\nI heard an interview with him years ago - he claims to have seen evidence of all this shit. I remember him saying there were photos of unidentifiable spacecraft and lists of people that were labeled \"off planet military personnel\" or something like that. The interview was fascinating - especially seeing how the US government has wanted to throw his ass in a Gitmo dungeon for all eternity ever since this came out. Kinda lends a little credibility to it all in my opinion.\n\nIt actually is plausible depending on how much data was pulled. Shockingly the floppy disk did survive the new millennium and probably lasted until 2003 before flash drives became far more common and affordable. It is more likely though that he used a zip-disk (100 MB floppy) or a CD-R to store the information.\n\nSo sad, up until about 2009 I still had users that refused to let go of their floppy disks. I didn't get rid up that until they retired and I yanked the drive. The reason they wanted the floppy drive was because they said they needed to backup their data. I tried explaining to them that all the data they are backup up to floppy is on a server that has redundancies built in plus daily backups to at the time tapes but now drives. They couldn't get that if their computer went up in smoke and I replaced it that all the data would still be o.k. so I gave up and let them play that floppy game. About a month ago I replaced a workstation that had a zip drive. The user wanted a zip drive in their new machine, I gave them a usb stick and told them to use that instead. Faster, cheaper, more reliable...\n\nThat doesn't mean he is always 100% unbiased in highly-politicized cases. Even doctors can have political agendas.\n\nRelying on expert testimony from either side of the court in highly-politicized cases is a complicated situation, especially when it's psychological stuff (which can be a very subjective thing in terms of diagnoses) and judges are aware of the faults in it.\n\nHowever I am of the mind that in situations like this, judges should err on the side of the defense unless the prosecution can prove overwhelmingly that the defense is bullshitting.\n\nI didn't mean to suggest his testimony was unassailable. Actually I found the entire article confusing since it first states that the defense claims he had not been examined by an expert in autism spectrum disorders, but then says that he was examined by 3 experts.\n\nSimon Baron Cohen is amongst the top handful of current autism spectrum disorder researchers in the world, and easily the most prominent in the UK. He's not just some random guy who conveniently supported the defence.\n\nActually a big thing about this a few years ago was that if he was tried in the UK he'd get something like 5 or 6 years. In America he's looking at 60 years (so basically until he's dead). They was arguing at one point for him to be tried in the UK and serve time here since he broke the law while in the UK and he wouldn't kill himself if he knew that he could serve his time and be a free man again at one point.\n\nPlus we all know how awful American jails are meant to be. And he has Asperger's and they want to make him spend forever in a strange country thousands of miles away from his friends and family.\n\nShit, if I was in his shoes and got extradited I'd kill myself as soon as the sentence was served.\n\nMr Stein confirmed that he was authorised to offer the appellant a deal in return for not contesting extradition and for agreeing to plead guilty to two of the counts laid against him of \"fraud and related activity in connection with computers\".\n\nWith Aspergers~ He literally would not grasp the scope of danger that he may have put himself in by doing what he did. People with this neurological disorder will go to extremes to learn and investigate their interest. In fact they become almost obsessed with certain subjects. Think of it this way, he is socially at the level of a child but his intelligence far exceeds the average adult. It would be like a three year old deciding they wanted to actually build sharks with lazer beams on heir heads. They would just do it without knowing the implications. Basically it would be like extraditing a child, a very intelligent child. He is probably beyond scared and it could cause him other major health issues both physically and mentally.\n\nAsperger's is not a disease. It's just a kind of person. Arguing that he couldn't help hacking into a foreign government's computer systems because he has Asperger's is akin to arguing that a psychopath couldn't help raping and killing all those ladies.\n\nIn this case, very little damage was done, and his risk of recidivism seems very low, so Asperger's seems like a very good thing to bring up in sentencing, but not in determining culpability.\n\nI'm not going to answer your question, but I am going to explain why it can be really bad and cause suicidal type behavoirs. Unwanted change can be pretty traumatic. I am on the Autism spectrum. When my depression was severe something as tiny as moving things around on my desk would cause me to have anxiety attacks. When I was living with my parents, any change would cause massive anxiety attacks that could manifest as depression and suicidal behavior. If anybody moves things around in my room I would have melt downs. Moving furniture, anything I wasn't in control of caused a great deal of anxiety. When it got really bad I coped with these melt downs I would hit myself in the head and I ended up hurting myself a lot.\n\nThe examples I listed are very tiny, and I do not know how to get people to understand how sensitive I am to change. An extradition is obviously a lot more severe than moving furniture. It's a massive change that the person has 0 control over meaning it's going to cause a great deal of anxiety. It depends on his circumstances and everything, but typically unexpected uncontrolled change for someone with autism makes them deal with change is a negative way. If he could deal with things like this in a proper way he would have never been diagnosed with anything.\n\nNot everyone with Asperger's reacts to changes in sensory stimuli, or changes with suicidal behavior, and a lot of people can cope with major change. Everybody is different. So in this case, it's his problems with Aspergers syndrome that cause a severe reaction and suicidal behaviors. But since those are caused from his problems with Aspergers it's just easy to say it's because of his Aspergers. These things need to be taken on a case by case basis. Your question isn't fair because most people don't understand how different each case is and the need for taking things on a case by case basis. You're asking as if all Aspergers is the same, when you should really only be asking if in this case.\n\nAt this point, any of the potential changes he's likely to face are going to be unwanted. I mean, I doubt he'd suddenly be okay with everything if they decided to just prosecute him in the U.K. and put him in a U.K. jail. And if they didn't send him to jail on account of his mental problems, there would likely still be some sort of confinement involved, whether at a residential treatment facility or through some kind of house arrest. Wouldn't those also be unwanted changes? You seem to be arguing that Aspergers should act as some sort of \"get out of jail free\" card.\n\nIf the UK (home country) can't find a doctor that has experience with Aspergers, then I doubt the US is going to be particularly care that he had no malicious intent whatsoever. Let alone take into account his Aspergers.\n\nI don't think Flints is arguing for a get out of free card, just reasoning that in this case, his condition does make extradition for a crime of no harm (other than their image) seem a bit crazy.We had a job to do, wether right or wrong, to keep the public from getting excited.\" (2)\n\n\"Of course UFOs are real, and they are interplanetary.

Just guessing though.\n\nReason I haven't researched him is because I'm more interested in the visitors views on life and earth than photographic \"evidence\", and Barbara Marciniak's \"Teachings from the Pleadians\" covers their views more, if we are to believe in it.\n\nThen you also have The Ra Material, The Casseopean Sessions, Alex Collier, Inelia Benz, Terrapapers all expressing different, but also much similar stories and thoughts. Quite a bit to take in, but very interesting.\n\nNot really my ideas, just posting some of the data from my own research to give a decent start for others, but thanks.\n\nI think everyone needs to do their own search to find their own truths and conclusions, not be told by others what to believe and break out of set inside-the-box belief systems and mind programs.\n\nFor me personally it led to exploring \"spiritual\", self-empowering aspects of life, and I started meditating regularly.

It might be criminally deviant intelligence, but it's still intelligence.\n\nI think the case against otherworldly visitation is beginning to buckle under the sheer volume of accounts. They used to say the accounts were no good because the witnesses were common and not credible because of professional inadequacy. What now?\n\nI have seen this, perhaps more than a dozen times. I've been sifting through this stuff for over thirty years. I've come to recognize that most of the people who blow it off, simply aren't aware of the volume of material. Plenty of it is clearly hogwash, but those who use that to turn their eyes away from further examination, are missing the big picture.\n\nGreat research and compilation. As more and more of the human population becomes aware of the reality of ETs it is important that we begin to think about what that will mean for human society when it becomes common knowledge. This kind of revelation on a large scale will have the potential to create a new paradigm of how we live and see ourselves in the universe. Check out this site for some ideas for discussion, regarding new technologies and new ways of living that may begin to manifest as we continue to awaken to what is really going on in our universe. \n\n\"I used commercially available software, and just scanned the network for blank passwords.\"\n\n\"I was just amazed at the lack of security, and this is meant to be the world police.

They say \"jump\" , the GB ask \"how high ?\"\n\nTo call the British \"the US's Poodle\" is inaccurate, if anything, the British government is the US's \"sex-slave\", where any sordid deed is carried out unquestioningly. A poodle would be thrown a bone every now and then.\n\nNice hyperbole. Good job ignoring that the U.K. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Russia. Or the fact that the U.K. - Russian relationship is pretty atrocious at the moment, with MI5 saying that Russian spying in the U.K. is at 'Cold War Levels' (source). Or the fact that in the context of population size the U.K. actually asks for more prisoners from the US than vice versa (source).\n\nAnd what do you mean political vs legal grounds? Extraditions should be political. Who honestly expects a nation to hand over its citizens to a country they cannot trust?\n\nWell, I don't visit World News very often for that reason. This comment of mine has a little more information. In fact that whole \"debate\" I had with that guy has some information\/opinions I would stand behind pretty firmly.\n\nCorrection: Britain is the abused parent whose troublesome off-spring (USA) got involved with the wrong crowd and broke away from the family, sleeping around with Mexican prostitues and gambling away its amassed fortune on fanatic wars with fundies, only to return decades later and start demanding more respect. Meanwhile Britain, an old fart with too many children to feed them all is sitting in a corner with a wheezy cough and a copy of the daily mail, reading of all it's old flames (India, Australia, Canada etc.) doing so much better since they broke up, leaving poor old Britain feeling wretched and weak, forced to live in a shambles of a flat where the rain never stops and the neighbours are either flamboyant sicophants or graecophobic jobsworths. Whats worse is how his wife Ireland won't speak with him anymore, and his brother Scotland wants to leave for good, and take away all the gas and shortbread, because he wrote The Wealth of Nations so he can do whatever the f*** he wants, never mentioning that one time they were bailed out of bankruptcy even once.\n\nThat's probably because many Scots want to leave the Union, as is indicated in the post. 'England' has a long history of being used in place of 'Britain', by the English. This only really changed after the 2nd wave of Empire, when the Scots were so heavily involved in the trade we had to popularise the term British again.\n\nEDIT. Where I have used the term England I meant English, and when I have used the term Britain I meant British.\n\nI am greatly disturbed by the fact that Britain's old flames also appear to be its own children in your parody ... we may be a bunch of inbred islanders, but even the royal family isn't that brazen about incest!\n\nInbred? That is utter bollocks. If my homeland is inbred even after the Britons, the Celts, the Romans, the Sarmations (courtesy of the Romans), the Saxons, the Angles, the Normans, the Norse and then many other smaller-scale waves of immigration and emmigration that has occured over the centuries, each bringing their own genes with them, then the whole world is just as inbred, where mass scale migration is not nearly as common outside nomadic tribes and disposessed peoples due to natural disaster or conquest.\n\nAnd further more, I described Australia and Canada as old flames, not off-spring, is because there were allready indigenous peoples inhabiting that space, be it the Aborigines, the Huron-Wyandot or whichever. As there is support for the view that the early pioneers were more likely to trade with or fight the locals for land, as opposed to all-out extermination like the Spanish down south or the USA later on, I felt that my analogy was authentic at least.\n\nMcKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, claimed that he was suicidal and that he would not survive a U.S. prison incarceration. She has received support from psychiatrist Professor Jeremy Turk of St George's Hospital, London, who said that suicide was now an \"almost certain inevitability\".\n\nJust taking a guess here. I think these clauses likely deal with external factors such as others wanting the party involved dead, not just saying \"You can't extradite me because I'll kill myself.\" Otherwise, the whole system wouldn't work too well\n\nOur federal prison terms need to be revised. They are barbaric and so far out of tune with the crimes committed. In addition, they provide no opportunity for parole or early release, so it is quite clear that rehabilitation is not a priority.\n\n\"The most shocking find to McKinnon, the one he thought would be his ace in the hole negotiating with the US government, what he \"stumbled\" on and found in the systems of US Space Command. McKinnon says he found a log that listed non-terrestrial officers. He doesn't believe that these were aliens, but he believes this to be evidence that the US military has a secret battalion in space. Some of these logs were ship to ship transfers. The names of two of the ships he saw on the transfer logs were the USSS LeMay and the USSS Hillenkoetter. Typically. Navy ship names just have two S', an acronym for United States Ship, however there are three S' here, presumably standing for United States Space Ship.\" blogpost\n\nI'm guessing these are the guys that the ships are supposedly named after:\n\nGeneral Curtis LeMay - \"The April 25, 1988 issue of The New Yorker carried an interview with retired Air Force Reserve Major General and former US Senator from Arizona, Barry Goldwater, who said he repeatedly asked his friend General LeMay if he (Goldwater) might have access to the secret \"Blue Room\" at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, alleged by numerous Goldwater constituents to contain UFO evidence. According to Goldwater, an angry LeMay gave him \"holy hell\" and said, \"Not only can't you get into it but don't you ever mention it to me again.\"[38]\"\n\nVice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter - \"The National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena was formed in 1956, with the organization's corporate charter being approved October 24.[6] Hillenkoetter was on NICAP's board of governors from about 1957 until 1962.[7] Donald E. Keyhoe, NICAP director and Hillenkoetter's USNA classmate, wrote that Hillenkoetter wanted public disclosure of UFO evidence.[8] Perhaps Hillenkoetter's best-known statement on the subject was in 1960 in a letter to Congress, as reported in the New York Times: \"Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.\"\n\nThis is simply unconscienable, UK GOVMNT!!! Is this another one of the estimable Theresa May actions?? If so, we should have her head today! Even if not, should have the head of whomever made this extraordinary decision. Quit buckling to the GD US on these actions. Know the whole British public is sick and tired of it!\n\nthe us needs to really reevaluate who it picks it's fights with. Ya, what this guy did was illegal, but an autistic computer nerd who wants to learn about UFOs isn't exactly a threat to national security. They're lucky this guy taught them a lesson in security because who knows how many other real bad guys accessed gov computers already.\n\nWhen the america goes to war with a technologically advanced nation, which may happen in our lifetimes, our military is going to realize just how insecure they are, that one guy with a computer and a modem can gain access.\n\nObviously the solution here is to put him in prison to let our enemies know that they \"REALLY shouldn't be doing that sort of thing\".\n\nI say anyone who hacks into a military should be given the option to work there for 10 years at a top salary. Punish the military for being hacked instead of punish the guy who figured out anyone can do it.\n\nvarious disorders like Aspergers have the lesser known name of \"We dont know where to put it but at least some of the people who have it the worst are similar to autism and a few of the symptoms look like nice version of autism so lets put it on the autism scale and see what happens\".\n\nAsperger's has in some ways become a meme that people use to describe people who aren't always as social in sometimes a derogatory way. It's not to say maybe the diagnosis didn't have some merit but I can only assume millions of people didn't suffer through this disease like the more autistic types that are more serious. Now if you want to carry around the asperger label it will imply an autism disorder, which would be pretty insulting if you weren't that strong of a case.\n\nYes, on Reddit Asperger's has become synonymous with \"Really nerdy person that has poor social skills\", as if it is some kind of personality trait. But most people with Asperger's have cognitive differences just like people labeled as \"autistic\"- trouble with sensory integration, inability to multitask, inability to properly regulate facial expressions and social emotions, extreme sensitivity to touch, sound, light, etc., language difficulties, learning difficulties. People will claim to have Asperger's because they read a few articles, but when they are in a room playing D&D with a bunch of nerds they get along with, suddenly there are no symptom of Asperger's. It is a neurological condition with multiple symptoms besides social awkwardness, and sometimes people with Asperger's have symptoms just as bad as those with classic autism- they are just more \"high functioning\" in other ways.\n\nIt's pretty bad when people run around claiming Asperger's as an excuse to be a dickhead in social situations and explain why they act certain ways. Usually, it's a self diagnosis which is fucking dumb. People actually have the disorder and it sucks.\n\nThis stopped being about Gary McKinnon a long time ago, and is now simply a dick-swinging contest between the US and the UK. The UK is simply testing to see how much they are allowed to say no to, before 'merica decides its going to stop asking and just take what it wants.\n\nThe thing is, they are still diagnosing people with Asperger's who lack normal self help skills. They diagnosed my brother with Asperger's after he was diagnosed as a child with Kanner's.autism. If you met him you would know how some people on the spectrum might not understand the rule of law so well.\n\nIt's not that he won't face some sort of punishment for his crimes, it's that his defense based entirely on suicide risk is such that he should not be exported to the USA for a trial here (where I live). I guess it's not like the British have much of a case for him huh? I doubt they'll release him back into the general population anytime soon if it's declared he's not mentally fit for trial, they could also take his internet away which could be pretty terrible if not compared to having absolutely no freedoms in a cell...he's still human.\n\nEdit - I may have been wrong, he may have only violated US law on UK soil. I doubt he will face anything but job offers if they don't send him to the US."}

That's pretty bad on it's own, but some viruses are much more complex than others and can be far more dangerous. Let's look at Stuxnet, coined as the first weapon made entirely out of code, and why it is so frightening.\n\nTelevision and films have almost desensitized us to the very idea of dangerous viruses. From nonsensical 'hacker' jargon in crime investigation shows to Jeff Goldblum using a computer virus to save the world from an alien invasion.

It has some very specific features that target nuclear reactor, specifically centrifuges that spin nuclear material at Iran's enrichment facilities. Viruses like Stuxnet aren't just fabricated in basements by angry, malevolent computer nerds - hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of data, meticulous research, and even knowledge of very classified internal systems all go into the development.\n\nOn top of that, viruses like Stuxnet can be available for anybody to find and toy with - it could be retooled for other malicious purposes. Check out a short video about the threat of the Stuxnet virus.\n\nNetwork security is becoming increasingly important for businesses, corporations, and organizations of all sizes.

Maybe it was something you were working on when your computer crashed, or maybe a disk failure wiped out some data. Does this bring back memories of frustration and angst?\n\nThere has been a growing trend where businesses are allowing more employees to work from home or other remote locations.

The Safer Internet Day is part of a global drive to promote a safer Internet for all users, in particular children and young people, and is organised by INSAFE, a European internet safety network co-funded by the European Commission.\n\nThe data presented in this News Release have been collected from the survey on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) usage in households and by individuals2 in the EU27, mainly carried out in the second quarter of 2010. More data on internet security and related topics can be found in the dedicated section on Information Society on the Eurostat website3.\n\n3% of internet users suffered financial loss\n\nIn the EU27 in 2010, almost one third of individuals (31%) who used the internet in the 12 months prior to the survey reported that they caught a virus or other computer infection4 resulting in loss of information or time during this period. The highest shares of internet users who caught a virus or other computer infection were found in Bulgaria (58%), Malta (50%), Slovakia (47%), Hungary (46%) and Italy (45%), and the lowest in Austria (14%), Ireland (15%), Finland (20%) and Germany (22%).\n\nAmong the individuals in the EU27 who used the internet in the last 12 months, 4% reported that they suffered from an abuse of personal information sent on the internet and\/or other privacy violations4 in this period, with the highest shares in Bulgaria and Spain (both 7%), Italy and the Netherlands (both 6%). In the same period, 3% of internet users in the EU27 suffered financial loss due to phishing or pharming attacks or fraudulent payment card use4, with the highest shares recorded in Latvia (8%), the UnitedKingdom (7%), Malta and Austria (both 5%).\n\nIn 2010 in the EU27, a large majority of individuals (84%) who used the internet in the last 12 months stated that they used an IT security software or tool4 to protect their private computer and data. Among the Member States, more than 90% of internet users in the Netherlands (96%), Luxembourg, Malta and Finland (all 91%) used IT security software, while it was less than two-thirds in Latvia (62%), Romania (64%) and Estonia (65%).\n\nUse of parental control software remains limited\n\nIn 2010, 14% of individuals in the EU27 who used the internet in the last 12 months and live in a household with children had a parental control or web filtering software4 installed. This share was highest in Luxembourg and Slovenia (both 25%), followed by France (24%), Denmark, Austria, the UnitedKingdom (all 21%) and Finland (20%).\n\nOf the individuals in the EU27 who used the internet in the last 12 months and live in a household with children, 5% reported that they experienced children accessing inappropriate websites or connecting with potentially dangerous persons4 while using a computer within the household. The highest shares were recorded in Italy (11%) and Latvia (9%).

The survey period was mainly the second quarter of 2010. Internet usage refers to those who reported using the internet during the 12 months prior to the survey. The security problems which these individuals experienced also relate to the 12 months prior to the survey. The indicators which refer to individuals living in a household with dependant children have been calculated especially for the purpose of this news release and are not available in the database. Dependant child is a child less than 16 years.\n\nCatching a virus or other computer infection (e.g. worm or Trojan horse): Computer systems could be infected with viruses, worms or Trojan horses which could damage personal computers and files, result in loss of time or money or other personal damage. A Trojan or Trojan horse is a non-self-replicating malware facilitating unauthorised access to the user's computer. Another example for computer infection is spyware which has installed itself on the computer to monitor and report on the respondent's computer activity.\n\nAbuse of personal information sent on the Internet and\/or other privacy violations (e.g. abuse of pictures, videos, personal data uploaded on community websites): Personal information sent on the internet are usually the name, address, and\/or e-mail details. Other privacy violations could be private pictures or videos uploaded over the internet and misused by third persons, or misuse of any personal details uploaded to community websites, i.e. sites used for social or professional networking.\n\nFinancial loss can be a result of receiving fraudulent messages ('phishing'), getting redirected to fake websites asking for personal information ('pharming') or can be due to fraudulent payment (credit or debit) card use.\n\nUse of an IT security software or tool to protect their private computer and data refers to the use of e.g. a firewall, anti-virus and anti-spam. The aim is to combat a wide range of threats, including worms, phishing attacks, Trojan horses and other malware. Anti-virus software scans files for infection using a dictionary and identifies suspicious behaviour from any installed computer program.\n\nA parental control or a web filtering software is software designed for controlling what content is permitted and for restricting material delivered over the internet. Parents may use this software to limit what sites children may view from computers at home.\n\nChildren accessing inappropriate websites or connecting with potentially dangerous persons refers to the use of the computer within the household. Mobile computers (laptop, handheld) are included but not phones.\n\nIncidents reported by internet users aged 16-74 who live in a household with children less than 16 years."}

{"text":"Malnets a Constant Moving Target\n\nTuesday, February 21, 2012 @ 02:02 PM gHale\n\nCybercriminals have gotten to a point where they can build an intricate network infrastructure and use it repeatedly for the distribution of malware, according to a new study.\n\nThese malware networks, or malnets, lure targets through trusted websites, then route them to malware through relay, exploit and payload servers to deliver the malware payload, according to the study from network security company Blue Coat Systems.\n\nWhile the sophistication level of these malnets keeps increasing, Blue Coat said they are identifiable and the user can block the malware attacks.\n\nThe problem is these malnets are constantly on the move, making them hard to pin down, the Blue Coat Systems 2012 Security Report said. In one case, in early February, a malware payload changed locations more than 1,500 times in a single day.\n\n\"These guys have become very sophisticated in really laying out these malware delivery networks, this organized set of infrastructure that they then activate, deactivate and can re-purpose depending on what they're launching,\" said Blue Coat's Sasi Murthy. \"They can now use this infrastructure and launch any kind of new attacks with pretty minimal effort.\"\n\nInformation about these malnets came together through the security vendor's WebPulse cloud service, which studies the Web traffic of 75 million users worldwide to identify potential malware attacks.\n\nFlash ad ID:57\n\nOne notable malnet incident of late was the Urchin site-injection attack, which began on Oct. 6, 2011, and lasted for 10 days. Blue Coat, however, started tracking Urchin four months earlier in June as part of the Shnakule malnet, and WebPulse viewed Urchin suspiciously. During the ensuing months, while Urchin lay dormant on the Internet, WebPulse matched the \"DNA\" of servers believed to be harboring Urchin and was able to block all requests from suspicious servers on the day the attack launched.\n\n\"We could see the sharks under the water before the fins were above the surface,\" Murthy said."}
{"text":"If what you mean is a criminal act, the more accurate word to use really would be \"criminal\" being that Hacking is not inherently criminal and the majority of Hackers are infact ethical, law abiding DIY nerds.\n\nWhat we're really talking about with this hole Hackers-are-bogiemen scare is \"cyberwar\" though isn't it. First, it's not warfare; there is no lethal component. At best, it's espianage; always was. Second, I really have to go with the description that \"cyberwar\" is having an army invade your country and stand infront of you in the line at starbucks. It's \"cyberinconvenience\" at best and has a really simple solution that doesn't reaquire all the political showmanship; stop accepting crappy products from vendors who make information security a second, third or fourth priority. If there was an impending cyberwaringhackerboggieman epidemic coming, it's only because we accept crappy products and security theater.\n\nFor a real-world example, there are a lot of articles out there about the Stuxnet attack. It is more of a big deal in the Control Systems world, rather than the broader IT community, but it is clear that someone weaponized code to actually destroy equipment. Apparently the target was Iran's nuclear centrifuges, and there is lots of educated speculation as to who wrote it. While there is no evidence anyone was killed, I would not want to be standing next to an industrial centrifuge when its speed control goes haywire and breaks the motor.\n\nNow, the big news is Duqu, Stuxnet's little spybot brother, which seems to be gathering information on facilities and control systems to gather the data (designs, code, passwords, etc.) necessary to launch another attack.\n\nCyberwar is already here. While I won't be wearing a tin-foil hat any time soon, I am concerned about securing our increasingly automated infrastructure. I really don't want someone to insert a virtual smart-bomb into our new \"Smart\" Grid.\n\nSure, shutting down ATC is going to be a problem at \"just the right time\". It's a magnificent movie plot and an obvious present danger to anyone who takes there security advice from hollywood screenwrites.\n\nan act against ATC\/flying public would be agression against a civilian population, therefore would fall under piratical acts. warfare is not permitted against civilians by Geneval conventions; if falling under war, it would necesarily be called a war crime, not war cyber.\n\nIs the leading scare that a rogue-hacker could get into our MBA computers and NSA infrastructure networks. This is not necessarily the case anymore. Why? Detection has become more sophisticated in the sense that it can at least be alert to a tier level 4 or 5 attack. Working forms of intrusions and their many innate characteristics used to be rendered as a threat for large-scale servers and networks. But one advancement in Network Security has come into the light, and that is UPS programmable fail-safe intrusion detection systems (PFI-DS) is what it is called. This new technology is manually driven and cannot be over-rode by a script. It works like a charm, for Information Technologists and The Security Alliance Commissions abroad. On any sign of a non-authorized transmissions, also dependent upon sensitivity factors and tier levels of danger-level awareness, the UPS system shuts down all power to the module, and the secondary switch is rendered useless to the hacker.\n\nIt is this kind of thinking that is crucial and essential to outsmarting the enemy. Whether it be a purely physical, micro, or virtual concept, either of these ways can thwart the common 21st Century Hacktivist Extraordinaire. We as a society need to be more aware and ready for action in this day and age than any other time right now, because we are becoming a more cyber-oriented civilization. This form of life can only be protected by strengthening all of networks and remaining completely secure. Otherwise, we are prone to an attack and an array of negative outcomes for our entire network to stop flourishing. In my belief, we can do as much as possible on our own to encrypt our files, delete browser history, run anti-virus scans, and maintain our internals. Other than this we must also be 99.98% sure of what we are doing.\n\nWho said lethality was a required component of war? War is about depriving your enemy of the resources needed to defend itself. Lethal actions deprive the enemy of human soldiers, but depriving him of other resources can be just as effective or more. War is a tool of diplomacy; hopefully the last tool a government reaches for.\n\nMost WWII bombing raids by the Allies weren't to kill people; they were flown to destroy Germany and it's allies of infrastructure - heavy manufacturing, oil and mineral refining, seaports, etc.\n\nAsk those who fed Stuxnet to those Iranian reactors if they thought they were conducting an act of war or merely inflicting a 'cyberinconvenience'. Ask the Iraqi how they classified it, too. That wasn't bogiemen or criminals, that was the action of a national government (either the US or Israel, or both). While it lacked lethality, it certainly deprived the Iraqi government of a military resource.\n\n\" ABSTRACT: For almost two decades, experts and defense establishments the world over have been predicting that cyber war is coming. But is it? This article argues in three steps that cyber war has never happened in the past, that cyber war does not take place in the present, and that it is unlikely that cyber war will occur in the future. It first outlines what would constitute cyber war: a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code.\n\nThe second part shows what cyber war is not, case-by-case. Not one single cyber offense on record constitutes an act of war on its own. The final part offers a more nuanced terminology to come to terms with cyber attacks. All politically motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of three activities that are as old as warfare itself: sabotage, espionage, and subversion. \" \n\n\" Dr. Thomas Rid works on the political and military aspects of cyber security at the Department of War Studies at King???s College London. \"\n\nSadly, I think it's more about people wanting to call something \"cyberwar\" for the benefit of using a sexy dramatic word or leveraging the fear-sell for whatever latest product\/law they are trying to shove through.\n\nWhen computer based soldiers step out of my computer screen and hold ground we can talk about the impending cyberwar; until then, it's just a blanket term used to confuse three seporate tactics.\n\nAnd in terms of potentially lethal, do we now claim that hitting another kid in the school yard is Warfare and initiate state responses too it? Hitting another kid can be potentially lethal given the correct set of circumstances.. probably more so than the required circumstances needed to make computer use potentially lethal.\n\nI'd agree that computer intrusion and sabotage can be a tactic used among others in real Warfare but \"warfare\" in and of itself.. I'm still not buying into the political agenda this War hype is constantly used for.\n\nThat's about the only reason I can figure that the US drones and\/or control systems are running Windows. Hey, I got an idea.. let's build this super secret military secure thingy.. and we'll run Windows on it just to be extra safe. You don't think these things should maybe have a real-time certified purpose built custom OS? Not really a job for QNX or something? Nah.. a retail shelf product with the largest malware liabrary available.. that's the ticket..\n\nI heard the the military in Egypt took over during the popular rebellion. How is this WW3? Usually a world war involves multiple nations working together to fight other multinational forces. There is an international cold war going on right now but it's a far cry from WW3.\n\nThe Illuminati is controlling the population through a special mind control technique called \"Human stupidity\".\n\nSarcasm aside I can see how some believe that WW3 has started. If I look at the situation, in say 1936, and compare it I see similar actors. Don't ask me who I think are this times Nazi's it will just degenerate into a trollgasm.\n\ninstitutionalized, fostered, and glorified. A lot of human stupidity is innate; the 'mind-control technique' is in fostering its growth. Flouride, a known brain-toxin, is added to much of the drinking water---the amount in a 12oz glass of tap water is the amount that a tube of toothpaste warns the user to contact poison control for ingesting! Public education (primary and a good part of secondary) promotes mediocrity--at its best, and actively persecutes the 'gifted'--at its worst. The public IS being raised stupid, it DOES serve 'entrenched uber-elites', and they DO know that and act tactically in society to foster stupidity.\n\nand although War Games doesn't necessarily fit the bill anymore, some newer movies such as Eagle Eye, (actually there's one similar to Eagle Eye but it's called Echelon Conspiracy or something like that and I can't remember the name at the moment, but it was a better example than Eagle Eye) , Live Free or Die Hard) although way over the top, do highlight some possibilities of cybercrime that could indeed affect the government directly.\n\nCould you people who leave comments please turn on your spell checkers. Your writing is terrible. You are getting your ideas across, but your writing makes you look like idiots. After you write your comment, please edit it before sending it.\n\naround here it's considered poor form to point that out. Doing so can give the impression you have no counter-position and are reduced to pointing out mechanical errors, although I assume that isn't what you intended.\n\nIncidentally, those using IE don't have a spell checker. The browser still hasn't incorporated one.\n\nCould you please turn on your brain. Your thinking is terrible. You are getting your writing across, but the words that you write makes you look like an idiot. After you write your comment, please edit it out before sending.\n\nCould World War III be caused by a rogue hacker? No, I dont think so at least not in the way thats shown in the movies but if things keep going the way they are, how could this not be the end result? Money and power is often the driving force of people all around the world, and if a target is left wide open for abuse, you know its just a matter of time before someone hits the button.\n\nOk, I will shorten this down: \"Could it? No. But how could it not?\" - What the hell? And the last part is just plain \"mysterious\" : Money and power is a driving force, so it's just a matter of time before someone ... what? Launches nuclear missiles? Power is in being capable of launching them... that power is gone the moment you actually launch them. Money potentially could be garnered by threatening to launch missiles... and perhaps we can even stretch our imagination to the perp launching one missile to make their threat believable. But one missile is not WWIII, and again, the power disappears as soon as you do a massive launch. Nobody's paying you after that.\n\nAnd the people likely to actually cause WW3, the populistic no-brain politicians currently in such strong favor, are certainly not hackers. So no, no hacker will cause WW3. And, probably not a criminal systems intruder either.\n\nthat all hackers are friendly, and would not use their talent to cause harm to another country, or perhaps society as a whole. Is it impossible that a hacker who happens to be a member of an anti-Semitic group might not learn how to disable the defenses of Israel and allow that group to successfully attack, provoking a pro-Israeli nation to perform retaliatory strike? Could that not escalate to a world - encompassing conflict?\n\nIt seems to me the danger is present and should not be discounted so easily.\n\nThat's less likely than being able to \"disable\" the defenses of the USA over the internet. And the Israelis would just break out their nuke. They have it, they've just agreed not to announce it. I guess they figure it will announce itself if needed.\n\nI can't see any nation using a nuke in response to a non-nuclear attack. To do so invites those other nations with nuclear capabilities to gang up on he who threw the first radioactive stone. Better to respond with an overwhelming conventional force.\n\nI had my first-ever comment 'removed' between yesterday and today (from YHWH's 'prophetic international thriller') describing a single nuclear exchange: a huge 'angel' whose legs were described as 'pillars of fire' (one on the land somewhere, one by the sea). Israel is described therein as having become by then 'a cup of suffering among the nations'.\n\nYHWH is a multi-lingual acronym for (W)ho the Masons call 'the Great Architect', at the risk of having a second comment flagged.\n\nI was attempting to post a reply to it, but accidentally hit 'Take Offline' instead. Since I abhor the 'Offline' utility, I flagged my 'Offline' post and requested deletion. Apparently your originating post went along for the one-way ride.\n\nBut a nuke hit would be stabbing in the dark (the \"glow\" would a little too late) against a cyberattack. It's hard to hit an enemy if you don't know where he is, that's the chief advantage of a guerrilla war.\n\nA cyberinconvenience attack can be stopped simply by pulling the plug or rerouting comms. They wouldn't bother with hitting the intruder, they'd hit the ones trying to take advantage of the weakened state of defenses.\n\n...you're under attack. A cyberattack would be silent, stealthy and undetectable until it's too late. Pulling the plug or re-routing links would temporarily disable your system, your guard would be down.\n\nGood news, Ansu...I think I've run out of comments on this one. See ya."}

{"text":"Real vs. Online Crime\n\nYesterday, I was chatting on Skype with my friend from Italy. We have known each other for years and he was always great help whenever I needed to translate something into Italian, or when I needed to understand specific local vocabulary (I love the sound and meaning of \"sfigato\" for example) or the meaning of various hand gestures (it seems to me that when Italians speak, they always have their hands in front of their noses moving in wild gestures). Our chat yesterday evolved around an update on the children before turning into how he \u2013 my friend \u2013 got scammed by bunch of crooks. I thought he was quite unfortunate because of the consequences for him (can't really go into the details) and because Italy is a rather safe place \u2026 at least based on the EUROSTAT statistics which monitor all crimes reported to the police. And since we are in on-line security business, and since EUROSTAT has loads of data on the ON LINE USAGE and CRIME, I pulled out a couple of reports for you as well.\n\nFirst of all, I looked at what people do report when they speak about on-line crime:\nSee the chart.\n\n- The majority of users in the EU 27 member states complain about spam\n(40%) Even though I'd call that nuisance and not necessary a crime.\n\n- 1 out of 5 European complained that they received a virus or other\ncomputer infection which resulted in loss of data or time.\n\n- 3% said their private data was abused.\n\n- 2% say their children were hit by visiting inappropriate websites.\n\n- 2% say they actually lost money through some on-line fraud.\n\nIf I would count only the severe threats (abuse of personal data, hits on children or loss of money), there are 7% of Europeans who have been victims to such online crime. And that is more than the average for standard crimes. What is also interesting is where the European \"winners\" are with the highest on-line crime rates: Latvia, UK and Netherlands.\n\nAnd since we are an antivirus company, the last overview that I pulled out was the country overview of virus attacks resulting in loss of data or time. Here the \"winners\" are Slovakia, Estonia and Malta. The countries with least reported virus hits are Ireland, Austria and Romania.\n\nBTW, In addition to Italian vocabulary I also love stats. So if you have similar data for the USA or other countries, please share it with me.\n\nI was co-chair of the local chapter of the National Infrastructure Protection Center. Most online crimes go unreported. If banks and financial institutions reported their breaches, customers believe they are insecure, and pull their money. This issue is so rampant, if it were on the news, it would crash the Stock Market.\n\nThe whole world market is too big for one company to hold.\nI suggest just follow the big guys of the antivirus market,they have offices everywhere and pay lots of money to make marketing research.\nSo where they pay more attention,you should keep an eye on it,because new market always grow fast and has more new opportunities.\nJust like PC market story,although Asia market was not as huge as USA ,but it grew fast,and now,it takes the place of USA to be the largest market."}
{"text":"Cyberattack and Cyberdefense\n\nDespite its increasing prominence, there are many challenges for both attackers and defenders engaging in cyberwarfare. In order to be effective in a cyberattack, however, the perpetrator has to succeed only once, whereas the defender must be successful over and over again. Another challenge is the difficulty of distinguishing between lawful combatants and civilian noncombatants. Civilians are capable of mounting and participating in cyberattacks against state agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and individual targets. The legal status of such individuals\u2014under the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions\u2014is unclear, presenting additional difficulty for those prosecuting and defending against cyberwar.\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge is the anonymity of cyberspace, in which anyone can mask his or her identity, location, and motive. For example, there is little solid evidence linking the Russian government to the Estonian and Georgian cyberattacks, so one can only speculate as to what motivated the attackers. If the identity, location, and motivation of an attack cannot be established, it becomes very difficult to deter such an attack, and using offensive cybercapabilities in retaliation carries a strong and often unacceptable risk that the wrong target will face reprisal.\n\nKey features of any country's major cyberdefense structure include firewalls to filter network traffic, encryption of data, tools to prevent and detect network intruders, physical security of equipment and facilities, and training and monitoring of network users. A growing number of modern militaries also are creating units specifically designed to defend against the escalating threat of cyberwar, including the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy, both of which formed new commands under USCYBERCOM. In the U.K. the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) created a Cyber Security Operations Centre in September 2009, and France set up its Network and Information Security Agency in July 2009. In October 2010 Australia's Defence Signals Directorate reported a huge increase in cyberattacks on that country's military computer networks.\n\nWhile the present focus is on defending against cyberattacks, the use of offensive cybercapabilities is also being considered. In many Western countries such capabilities are proscribed extensively by law and are alleged to be the preserve of intelligence agencies such as the NSA in the U.S. and GCHQ in the U.K. In China it is believed that organizations such as the General Staff Department Third and Fourth Departments, at least six Technical Reconnaissance Bureaus, and a number of People's Liberation Army Information Warfare Militia Units are all charged with cyberdefense, attack, and espionage. Similarly, it is thought that in Russia both the Federal Security Service and the Ministry of Defense are the lead agencies for cyberwar"}

The new model will help utilities protect against hackers who would make it difficult to keep your power running. |\ncredit:\nCourtney Flatt\n| rollover image for more\n\nRICHLAND, Wash. \u2013 A window-sized screen updates real-time electricity data, as computers hum in the background. The Electricity Operations Center at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory could serve as a back-up control center for an electrical utility, if its ability to deliver power were wiped out by a disaster \u2014 including a cybersecurity attack.\n\nIf electric utilities do not properly protect themselves, they can be vulnerable to hackers, who would make it difficult to keep your power running.\n\nThat's why it's important for utilities to know if they have good cybersecurity measures in place, says Paul Skare, chief cyber security manager at the lab.\n\nSkare has helped the Department of Energy develop an online model for utilities to assess their security. It's meant to help electric companies pick out the biggest threats to keeping the power on. That way, utilities can do a better job guarding against those attacks.\n\n\"What we'd like to see is that the privacy of all the individual consumers are protected, so all your billing information and personal information,\" Skare says. \"From an electric system point-of-view\u2026 We want to make sure that the high-voltage part of the grid stays up and running because that would have the biggest impact on the largest number of people.\"\n\nTo assess cybersecurity, utilities will be able to take a survey that compares their measures to the online model. They will then be graded on a four-point scale, depending on their system.\n\nThe survey will measure various different components, including:\n\nHow utilities track and plan for cybersecurity risks\n\nIf utilities have a cybersecurity program in place. These programs can monitor cybersecurity in coordination with the agencies like the FBI, or at the utility through different computer programs\n\nHow companies train and vet their staff\n\nIf a utility has an emergency response plan in place to prepare for storms or surprise power outages\n\nSkare says utilities will eventually be able to gauge their security plans against others.\n\n\"When you're comparing a small utility in a region to another small utility, they like to get the feeling that they're doing it in a similar fashion to show their ratepayers that they're spending their money as wisely as they can,\" Skare says.\n\nHe says utilities will be able to better spend their money on beefing up security once they understand their gaps. The survey allows utilities to prioritize their cybersecurity aspects. That's especially important to smaller utilities, says Annabelle Lee, technical executive of cyber security at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).\n\n\"Whether they're under a state or union or co-op, they can't just spend lots of money. They have to justify it to somebody, and they have to look at the highest priorities. Number one priority is the reliability of the grid. Cybersecurity supports reliability,\" Lee says.\n\nIn a 2011 report, EPRI found that updating the grid's cybersecurity could cost $3.7 billion. That's a drop in the bucket compared to a total smart grid update, which could range from $338 to $476 billion. Still, costs vary from utility to utility, Lee says, depending on what needs to be upgraded.\n\n\"If it's an organization that has large, expensive equipment that's really old, replacements are expensive,\" Lee says. \"If some utilities have started to upgrade some of the protocols that they're using, then it may not be as expensive. It depends which devises they're replacing.\"\n\nLee says standards reports also can help utilities figure out what cybersecurity is important to their organization.\n\nSkare hopes that eventually all the nation's utilities will gauge their cybersecurity risks with this newly developed model.\n\n\"In the end,\" Skare says, \"it's the consumers who will pay for this with their electric bills. So, as a consumer myself, I like to make sure all the money I'm paying for electricity is spent in the wisest way possible. And I think that, overall, this [model] allows utilities to target where they spend their money, rather than putting too much money in one area so that it's not needed or leaving a weak link in some other area"}

Whilst the first well-documented attacks were against gambling sites and online payment systems, no company should consider itself immune. Especially when your organization will undoubtedly share its Internet Service Provider (ISP) with other businesses who rely on e-commerce and might be more desirable targets to criminals looking for extortion money.\n\nThe question you need to ask is - if the company's web site or ISP was unavailable for hours or days, would it effect the business in terms of lost revenues and damage to reputation? Most organizations would quickly answer 'yes'.\n\nSo what is a DDoS attack? The aim of a DDoS attack is to paralyze online systems. The attacker compromises a number of unprotected hosts and installs a 'demon' or 'trojan' onto the system. The trojan-infected hosts in turn act as handlers and are able to compromise other computers, which operate as agents for the attack."}
{"text":"Researchers have discovered a security loophole created by a missing dot in an email address.\n\nIt seems hackers can gain valuable information from companies online simply with grammar errors. With a mistyped email address a hacker can receive valuable information such as user names, passwords, and other corporate information despite any fraudulent misspelling. Such malicious domains are called \"Doppelganger Domains\" and are being used to create loopholes that will leave companies vulnerable to identity theft.\n\nA Doppelganger Domain can resemble an existing domain or sub-domain but with the exception of a missing dot in the url. Despite the differences, Doppelganger Domains can receive information that would otherwise not be delivered. The process is quite simple. The person responsible can set buy a domain that resembles an actual domain from a company. This is called \"Typosquatting\". The owner of the Doppelganger Domain can then configure an email server to receive all email addressed to that domain, regardless of its lack of authenticity. This type of configuration is called a \"Catch-all Email Account.\"\n\nWhat make companies especially susceptible to this loophole is the way their email systems are set up. Though most have a single domain for their website, many use sub-domains for individual business units, regional offices or foreign subsidiaries. Dots used to separate the words in those sub domains. For example, a company could have \"bank.com\" as its main domain and and \"uk.bank.com\" as the sub-domain for one of its branches. In order to create a Doppelganger Domain resembling that of the company, one only requires to type one of the domains without the dot. For example, ukbank.com.\n\nIf it all still sounds to good to be true, researchers Peter Kim and Garrett Gee of GodaiGroup have recently proven this by setting up their own Doppelganger Domain to send and receive information with each Fortune 500 company. Shockingly, one Doppelganger Domain gained 20GB of data from 120,000 wrongly sent messages over a period of six months. From this, researchers have determined that About 30% of the top 500 companies in the US were vulnerable to this security shortcoming.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. The owner of the Doppelganger Domain can also send replies between the recipient and sender to gain more valuable information. By acting as a middleman, the owner of the Domain can create a malicious network to draw in more valuable information from several companies until they are exposed. the sky is the limit with this type of email fraud.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the email loophole, you can read Peter Kim and Garrett Gee research paper here.\n\nIntroduction to Microsoft Certification\n\nEnter Email for further information\n\nEmail Address\n\nWould you like to start your own Microsoft Certified Computer Technician Business?\nDon't like to study for years and pay a fortune going to University?\nJoin Technician In A Box and learn how to run a Microsoft computer services business from home."}
{"text":"Several power utilities say they face a barrage of cyber attacks on their critical systems, a report by two Democratic lawmakers found echoing warnings from the Obama administration that foreign hackers were trying to bring down the U.S. power grid.\n\nCalifornia Representative Henry Waxman released the report, co-authored with Massachusetts Representative Ed Markey, at the House Energy and Commerce Committee's cybersecurity hearing on Tuesday.\n\nThe pair asked some 160 utilities to describe their experiences fighting cyber attacks over the past five years. In response, more than a dozen said they experienced daily, constant or frequent attempted cyber attacks, according to a 35-page report summarizing their responses.\n\nCritical control systems inside two US power generation facilities were found infected with computer malware, according to the US Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team.\n\nBoth infections were spread by USB drives that were plugged into critical systems used to control power generation equipment, according to the organization's newsletter for October, November, and December of 2012. The authors didn't identify the owners of the facilities and there's no indication the infections resulted in injuries or equipment failures.\n\nTerrorists could black out large segments of the United States for weeks or months by attacking the power grid and damaging hard-to-replace components that are crucial to making it work, the National Academy of Sciences said in a report released Wednesday.\n\nBy blowing up substations or transmission lines with explosives or by firing projectiles at them from a distance, the report said, terrorists could cause cascading failures and damage parts that would take months to repair or replace. In the meantime, it warned, people could die from the cold or the excessive heat, and the economy could suffer hundreds of billions of dollars in damage.\n\nWhile the report is the most authoritative yet on the subject, the grid's vulnerability has long been obvious to independent engineers and to the electric industry itself, which has intermittently tried, in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security, to rehearse responses.\n\n\n\nTwo companies, Lockheed Martin and LaserMotive, have managed to keep the Stalker Unmanned Aerial System, also known as a drone, in flight for over 48 hours by using lasers on the ground to recharge the aircraft's battery mid-flight. So \u2026 that's terrifying and cool. LaserMotive held the test in an enclosed wind tunnel, and if you're wondering what happened after 48 hours, well, it seems they just got bored.\n\nLeaving home while carrying a phone, an iPad and a laptop might also mean lugging along several tangled power cords. Now add radios and GPS devices. Now strap them to your person and wrap the cords around your body beneath your 30-pound armored vest. Oh, and you're on patrol in Afghanistan, which means there's no place to plug in when your phone's batteries start to die. This explains why the Pentagon is keen on eliminating those cables with wireless chargers, and now wants to boost the range to more than 50 feet.\n\nThe plan involves spending $5-6 million using the branch's research and development centers to \"increase the efficiency of power transfer over longer distances,\" according to an Army statement. If successful, it means that soldiers \u2014 instead of being limited to recharging their gadgets when returning to base, or by plugging into their vehicles \u2014 could go cordless. That means recharging by a wireless battery attached to their body \u2014 no plugs. The Army also hopes to build wireless transmitters on bases, allowing soldier gear to recharge passively, without having to plug anything in. And one day, it might be used on drones.\n\nA major cyber attack is currently under way aimed squarely at computer networks belonging to US natural gas pipeline companies, according to alerts issued to the industryA proposed high voltage electrical cable running across the floor of the North Atlantic Ocean to tap Iceland's surplus volcanic geothermal energy would become the world's longest underwater electrical cable, if it goes ahead. The cable would be a significant step towards a pan-European super grid, which may one day tap renewable sources as far afield as Scandinavia, North Africa and the Middle East. It's argued that such a grid would be able to widely transmit energy surpluses from active renewable sources, thereby alleviating the need for countries to use (or build) back-up fossil fuel power stations to cater for peaks in demand when more local renewable sources aren't particularly productive.\n\nIf a European super grid comes to fruition, energy surpluses will be big business. So it's hardly surprising that both Germany and the United Kingdom are jostling for position at the other end of the Icelandic cable, with Norway and the Netherlands also having been mooted as potential connectees. That would necessitate a cable at least 745 miles (1198 km) in length, making it easily the longest electrical cable in the world."}

{"text":"One email exposes millions of people to data theft in South Carolina cyberattack\n\nA report is expected to be released Tuesday detailing how an unknown cyber hacker broke into South Carolina's computers and stole millions of tax returns from residents dating back years. NBC's Michael Isikoff reports.\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. -- A single malicious email sent to workers at the South Carolina Department of Revenue last August enabled an international hacker to crack into state computers and gain access to 3.8 million tax returns, including Social Security numbers and bank account information, in what experts say is the biggest cyber-attack ever against a state government, according to details in a report released Tuesday.\n\n\"We were a cocktail for an attack,\" Gov. Nikki Haley said, referring to the necessary ingredients for cyberassault, as she released a report by a computer security firm Mandiant, which was commissioned to investigate the data breach. At the same time, Haley accepted the resignation of her Department of Revenue director, Jim Etter, and acknowledged that state officials \"could have done more\" to protect the personal data of state residents.\n\nThe release of the report came amid a mounting political uproar here over the cyberattack and criticism of Haley over her handling of the issue.\n\n\"I've gotten more phone calls and emails about this than anything else in the last four years,\" said Tom Davis, a state senator and former chief of state to Gov. Mark Sanford. \"There's a great degree of anger and frustration over what happened. This is information you've got to give the government; if you don't, they put you in jail. There's a real sense of betrayal,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Mandiant report, the cyberattack, which state sources say is believed to have originated inside Russia, started with a \"phishing\" scheme, a common tactic used by cyber criminals.\n\nLast Aug. 13, a hacker sent multiple South Carolina Department of Revenue employees a malicious email containing an embedded link containing malware or a computer virus. When at least one of the employees clicked on the link, the malware was activated and allowed the hacker to steal the employee's user name and password.\n\nFrom there, the hacker was off to the races. Two weeks later, the attacker logged onto the remote-access service for Department of Revenue computers, using the credentials of an employee who had clicked on the Aug. 13 email. The invader then \"leveraged the user's access rights to access other Department of Revenue systems and databases with the user's credentials,\" the report states.\n\nThe attacker performed \"reconnaissance activities\" over the next several weeks, then started copying large amounts of data and transferring them onto zip files that were moved onto the Internet. The breach was not discovered until the Secret Service notified state officials on Oct. 10 that it had uncovered information that data on three state residents had been stolen.\n\nSince then, Haley and other state officials have scrambled to react as the magnitude of the attack has become increasingly apparent. In addition to 3.8 million tax returns, including the Social Security numbers of 1.9 million children and other dependents, the hackers got access to data on 699,900 business tax returns and 3.3 million bank accounts.\n\nThe attack has exposed vulnerabilities that experts say will cause state governments across the country to reexamine their cyber-defenses. Although South Carolina had encrypted credit card numbers according to industry standards, it had never encrypted the Social Security numbers. And some cyber experts say there is evidence that that data may now be marketed on Internet black market sites that peddle personal information on millions of Americans.\n\nHaley on Tuesday blamed the federal government for not requiring Social Security numbers to be encrypted. She released a letter to IRS Commissioner Steven Miller \"to strongly encourage the Internal Revenue Service to require all states to have stronger security measures for handling federal tax information, particularly encryption of tax information that is stored or 'at rest.'\"\n\nDiscuss this post\n\nHaley on Tuesday blamed the federal government for not requiring Social Security numbers to be encrypted\n\nLet's see if I have this straight; a proponent of 'smaller government' is now blaming the feds for not 'interfering' more in the state's handling of data? What's up Nikki, not smart enough to know this, or just too cheap to spend the money needed to do a good job?\n\nI'm sure that by the time this gets to FauxNews, it will be all Obamas fault. I'm waiting for the RWNJ to appear here and 'spin' this....\n\nHaley on Tuesday blamed the federal government for not requiring Social Security numbers to be encrypted.\n\nYo Niki,\n\nYou're too funny. It was YOUR state that got hacked, not the federal government, yet you want to blame the Feds. Tighten up your security. You bitch about federal intrusion into the state and individual yet when YOU get hacked suddenly YOU want to pass the blame. Sorry sweetheart but the buck stops with YOU!!!!!!!!!\n\nWait, what?! A republican governor asking for more federal regulations??? Don't they usually scream for more freedom for their state? These scumbags are so shameless, it's hilarious! Well, sorry SC, you got what you voted for. Maybe next time you will put a little more thoughts into it.\n\nAMEN.... I was going to say the same thing...But you just said it much better....\n\nSince when does someone who exists to gripe about Federal intrusion need for \"da Gub'ment\" to tell them to do their job of protecting taxpayer information. You need \"Big Brother\" to TELL you to encrypt that information?\n\nWithin a couple of months of using my credit card to pay some business back taxes here in the USVI, my credit card was \"compromised\" with a duplicate card in Alabama. How do I know they made a duplicate card? Because they were used in retail stores, not online. Stores require a card to scan, especially Winn Dixie, Lowe's, and JCPenny's. I can understand how this would have happened with one of these hackers and their vicious emails. That is why I NEVER open any email from someone I do not know, especially if it has attachments or linksThis is called (if I remember from the last election) \"taking responsibility\".\n\nqudreps, yes, the state of SC (I live here) has contracted with Experian to offer identity theft protection at no charge for one year. In addition, I have added a \"security freeze\" to prevent any new credit card, bank account, etc. from being opened in my and my wife's name. I have never paid income taxes using a credit card so the hackers don't have that information (yet) but knowing they have my SS number is bad enough.\n\nIn its first formal cyber strategy, the Pentagon has concluded that computer sabotage by another country could constitute an act of war, administration and military sources told NBC News on Tuesday, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe officials emphasize, however, that not every attack would lead to retaliation. Such a cyber attack would have to be so serious it would threaten American lives, commerce, infrastructure or worse, and there would have to be indisputable evidence leading to the nation state involved, NBC Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski said.\n\nBy asking for Federal Government help, and blaming this on the IRS Gov. Haley is trying to pass the buck for her obvious incompetence. Of course, to allow this to happen many people made stupid mistakes, not the least being the right-wing conservatives of South Carolina who gave her the job. As Bobby Jindal has pointed out the Republicans have to stop being the party of stupid.\n\nAs long as the info is only used to get employment or social services then no crime has been commited. It's only a crime when the info is used to steal from the person the info belongs to as per the justice dept..\n\nDon't these idiotic employees\n\nSo Haley is claiming that a simple lack of a federal regulation is to blame for a theft of S.C. taxpayer information from the S.C. government? That doesn't even pass the initial whiff test. S.C. should have implemented it's own encryption or beefed up security in other ways to make sure the theft could not occur. Now that it has, Haley should resign.\n\nOh, and OF COURSE it's politicized...it involves government and elected officials and their appointees. Of all things, this is one that SHOULD be politicized...for cryin' out loud. Did you even think at all before commenting???? Or are you just a republican apologist?\n\nI had my Debit card copied - I'm pretty sure it was at Olive Garden - restaurants are the number one place your card gets copied. They rang up $1,700 in about 2 hours at two Malls before the card went into automatic shut down.\n\nWho steals more - cyber crooks or employees who spend have the day at work on the Internet?\n\nHaley on Tuesday blamed the federal government for not requiring Social Security numbers to be encrypted\n\n==============================================================who required SSN to be issued? who is responsible first and foremost to protect citizens from both foreign and domestic enemies? again the left just wants to blame someone for pointing out that it is the federal governments responsibility to make sure the SSN that they require us to get are in fact secured from theft by both foreign and domestic enemies. the state has the responsibility to make sure our SSN are safe as well, the blame is at all levels.\n\ndo you think that it requires regulation to solve this problem? do you even know that regulations and responsibilities are not the same thing? the US government is responsible to adhere strictly to the US constitution and nothing else. the US government uses regulations to create powers not otherwise granted by the constitution.\n\nwhen will the failures of government ever make it to the minds of the indoctrinated? when something is wrong why do you say the problems do not exist? when someone points out a problem why do you say they are a nut and ridicule them? how can you call yourself a winner when you step on those you compete with? how can a leader lead when he has no leadership skills? how could people vote for anyone that tells lies to their face?\n\nwhen the lead lemming falls of the cliff the other lemming followers do not second guess the decision of the leader regardless of peril, they just blindly follow. this is how voters are to politicians.\n\nBefore ever finishing this article, I wondered how long it would take before someone politicized it. That was a short wait - and from the \"Tolerant\" and \"Enlightened\" crowd.\n\n=================================================So what's new...just another republican hypocrite. Just like Paul Lyan', er, Ryan who screamed the stimulus didn't help the economy but behind closed doors begged for some. Just move on...nothin' new here.\n\nThis sounds like an excellent opportunity to disban the IRS, abolish corporate and personal income taxes, and convert to the \"Fair Tax.\" I wouldn't necessarily stop personal information theives, but it would:\n\nReplace Federal Income Tax with a National Sales Tax.\n\nBe budget neutral and could be implemented almost overnight.\n\nBe a more fair system where everyone truly pays their fair share (including people here illegally).\n\n.............Ummm, why are you asking us, ask Haley the rocket scientist, she's the one who complained about lack of Federal regulation on encrypting, can't you read?\n\nim not in agreement with haley but im sure not gonna just ignore a serious problem because you people on the left want to be braggarts about an election. she is responsible to protect our SSN just as the federal government is. we dont need regulations to do the obvious but i guess your a okay with just blaming for blames sake.\n\nno stimulus has ever helped a struggling economy, it has only prolonged the pain and put us in further debt. its not the governments job to take my money and give it to someone else. free market has always worked until government gets involved for power, greed is not limited by anything but other greedSwagganaut: im not in agreement with haley but im sure not gonna just ignore a serious problem because you people on the left\n\n================================================\n\nWhy is it people like you assume that because someone disagrees with you, they are on the left? Maybe it makes you feel good to make that accusation, but it shows your ignorance. I am not on the left, I am anti-stupidity in this country, but people like you wouldn't understand that. I don't like the DEMs and a lot of their agenda, e.g., I do not support the DREAM Act. I am for the Middle Class and Main Street, unlike Gov. Haley and her bullcrapping friends in the GOP\/TPThat's what Haley claims, but the cost of that $12 million fund will be passed along to the taxpayer. It's always the taxpayer who ends up covering for incompetence in government.\n\nAnd Haley is a hypocrite, trying to pass the buck for responsibility to the federal government. Don't let her fool you. She'd have fought a federal regulation to require encryption of S.C. taxpayer's SS numbers.these are your posts. while yes i am assuming you are left of ME which is very true. you are left of right and maybe right of left but you are no moderate or independent. being against the dream act does not make you 'not left', its your vitriol and rhetoric that you use to describe haley and \"gop\/tp\" that makes you 'left' in this context of only going after a republican and not any democrats.\n\nmaybe you are a progressive? even worse that would be but you are not someone who works to solve issues, instead you just blame because someone told you to blame.\n\nfed government should have long ago required all SSN transactions encrypted as well as certain personal information. this does not require any regulation to implement as there are already encryption protocols at the federal level in place. haley is a fool but so are the feds, you cant point out one clown without pointing out the rest.\n\nTed Koppel thinks that cyber security isn't covered enough by the media. He thinks it is a major issue that is lacking the attention it needs. He said this (in more eloquent terms) in his interview with Marvin Kalb in \"Twilight of the Network News.\"\n\nRegarding your statement: \"Don't these idiotic employeesStay off the porno sites and do your job you're being paid to do!\"\n\nYou must only work on your computer at home. The majority of the emails I get during the day have attachments, they are work related and over 50% are from people I do not know. We have to open the attachments, they are usually medical, legal, etc attachments. However we get the hackers too, despite thousands and thousands spent keeping them out. Good news is that all of our SS numbers are encrypted and cannot be sent unless they go secure mail. Our IT guys have to send out at least 2x per week emails about new threats. Unauthorized use of our computers and the internet is monitored like Big Brother so there is no Internet browsing. Just saying that you do not need to be doing anything other than your job for there to be a cyber attack.\n\nI, for one, hope this guy gets his cojones chopped off for this! Sick of the ongoing fraudspamcyberattacks. I get email from Nigerian Doctors, banks asking me to verify my info, and pharmacy emails overflowing my junk mail. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ALREADY! Deal with these crimes swiftly, and maybe for once, they'll take a step back and reassess if this path is worth it for them instead of putting those brains to work at a real job!\n\nSounds more like they should have fired the IT Director, it was his responsibility to ensure the security of the network.\n\nI have worked for two government agencies, one federal and one state and contracted to two others, and have found that in nearly every case, they are plagued with political nonsense and the incompetent IT staff have usually gotten their position more due to politics than competency.\n\nIt's not just the money. They now have the ability to get a full set of credentials with your information on it. There's no insurance for being arrested for being in default of a warrant in a state you've never stepped foot in.\n\nSmaller federal government? Can you imagine these people in charge of clean water? Air quality? Food standards?\n\nLet me make this perfectly clear, The Government does NOT care about your SS# and ID Theft. They profit from it, just as much as banks do. They both know that the Original Michael Coats lives in Tennessee. They also know the fake Michael Coats lives in Colorado. I was lucky enough to have a cool SS Admin Agent show me ALL the fakes, (There were a lot of them.) Same for the IRS, and the Federal Reserve. They collect taxes from the fakes, SS, Payroll, etc. Unfortunately, I am not eligible for all the fake taxes to come back to me, which tells me MY Government is complacent in the theft and ID fraud. and sent a letter to the IRS suggesting they begin requiring encryption in their standards. You also do not have the fact that SC has offered all state residents free security through Experian because of this because MSNBC did not tell you to think that. You also do not have that the political bottom feeders spent 2 weeks spouting to every media outlet that would listen about why they were not told about it earlier when that was the request from the federal investigators instead of doing something about the problem and that the \"class action\" lawsuit the media is drooling over is by an ex-politico who lost the election and happens to also be a lawyer and has tried multiple times to sue Haley before. You do not have any of this because MSNBC did not tell you to think of it. Instead they told you what they wanted you to know fully aware that most would just react and make comments rather than check it out. Media education is not education at all.\n\nWe need a new and improved National ID\/SSI card. I can't figure out how the SSI 3+2+4 digit scheme is adequate this day in age. You have Republicans screaming for the need of state issued voter ID cards that you have to jump through hoops to obtain, yet the SSI number has virtually no safeguards and is used in so many aspects of our lives. Come on Congress, get your fricking act together and join the 21st century.\n\nPlease...Gov. Haley could have instituted safer measures anytime she wanted. But she has to wait for the Federal Govt to tell her before she makes it happen? Then whine about too many Federal regulations.\n\nThe sheer lack of responsibility is mind boggling. This is why the Federal govt has to make laws and regulations in the first place...because the states show no sense of responsibility or take action on their own unless forced. Like little kids....\n\nBut wouldn't that be a Federal Regulation? I thought you righties hated those and the dadgum gummint that makes 'em.\n\nIsn't Haley's smarter-than-the-feds hallowed State Government (hear the angel chorus?) smart enough to figure this out before the crisis happened?\n\nNow Gov. Haley wants the feds to regulate? Funny republicans like regulations when they feel like it, they like federal support when they suffer a natural disaster and sure as heck don't mind taking more money from the federal government than their red states put in in general. They make me sick.\n\num, new regulations passed have already increased our burden by more than it should ever be along with the ones passed under bush and before him. regulations are about control, not responsibility.\n\n=====================================\n\nplease name and describe those new regs. If businesses exhibited the level of responsibility we expect, then I agree control would not be necessary, but the recent Wall Street fiasco has shown we can't trust them. Perhaps we should eliminate all regulations on the auto industry, and allow thousands of people to die on our highways due to all the dangerous vehicles that would result.\n\nwall st fiasco? your kidding right? i guess you have been brainwashed. the GOVERNMENT is the one who created the whole mess, they basically played around with the economy and screwed it up. dont put all the blame on civilian greed when its the government job not to be greedy and it has done just the opposite.\n\nyou ask me cite one reg but i cant even begin to explain why that in of itself is the most ignorant thing anyone has ever said, ever. there are always new regs regardless of who is president and each reg COST SOMEONE MONEY or did you not take any school classes. some regs are good but most are bad.\n\nRegulations can be subjected to those who just rally count. For instance, the government fixed up (widened) a six mile stretch of the highway;they then changed the speed limit from 50 to 60 mph. Some anti-government malicious person will subjectively call it a \"new regulation\"\n\nWhen Swagganaut but the blame for CDO and CDS liquidation of the global economy 2008 through 2010 on the US Government I just had to shake my head. Excuseme Swahhanaut, of the $3 trillion in CDO, CDS out there, that the banks defaulted on, how much was issued by the government? That would be $0. How much did the government bail-out the masters of the universe? A lot, which is why Greece has 25% unemployment and we dont\n\nYep, blame the federal government, fire your Department of Revenue director and play CYA. Way to accept responsibility Gov. Haley. Trouble is you can't even tell your constituents the buck stops with you because somebody in Russia has it now.\n\nResign or recall the stupid biatch. Immediately! Take some respsonsibility for your lack of actions to require more secure and encrypted data and go find a more dignified way to make a living that matches your qualifications..... like working the streets and selling your only ass et of any value.\n\nMost illuminating... if the peons don't give their information to their government masters, they go to jail. But if the government masters can't secure that information - well... ain't that just too bad.\n\nThis was a TOTAL LACK of proper protocols. If a SINGLE government drone employee can compromise an entire STATE, then the killer hacking bees will invariably attack.\n\nDo they not have anti-malware on these government computers? My god, even an idiot knows how to do that.\n\nBut then again - we are talking about the government... so my last statement may not be true.\n\nThe problem is...... the employee (who most likely has a degree in political science) clicked on a URL that was embedded in an e-mail. That's a basic computer security no-no. Unless you know where it's taking you, don't click it. I would love to see the e-mail that was used to \"trick\" this government employee (probably something like \"go to  and see how liberals are messing up the country\").\n\nHer administration should be setting up sane IT rules similar to fortune 500 companies and disallow employees from going all over the web on company assets.\n\nI thoroughly appreciate the irony (along with many other people posting today). When a tea party darling asks for more regulations and guidelines.\n\nI am a federalist as well, but if she wants to be in charge, she needs to accept responsibility for how her state conducts their business.\n\nVery poor security design. No one employee should be able to get to all that information. On top of that you never use only a single userid and password for remote access to sensitive information. You should always require 2 one of which is generated randomly by token or security app. Then again government employees are not the brightest, once they get their foot in the door the union prevents getting rid of incompetence.\n\nwhy do you people always use \"regulations\" as both the anti and pro stances on any republicans? regulations are about control not common sense. we dont need any regulation to tell any government agency that they need to protect our SSN that they mandate we have. ITS REQUIRED!!!! regulations are never an answer to solve problems.\n\nNot only is more regulation a bad idea, what they are proposing won't always work. The people coming up with these laws don't understand enough about technology to propose the proper requirements. I've worked with customers that were subjected to these \"data at rest\" encryption laws required of goverenment vendors. Most of the ways that I have seen it implemented would not have prevented this, and this is the most common method of attack.\n\nI watched a video today about the design of Windows 8. One of the things the presenter mentioned was an anecdote about a clock maker; \"a watch owner goes to get his watch cleaned. As the clock maker takes the watch apart the owner notices a very beautiful inscription in Latin. The owner asks what the clock maker why he spent so much time inscribing the clock in a location where nobody will see it. The answer was that God would see it\".\n\nThe point being that if you just strive for mediocrely we will never move ahead. Gov. Haley says that the Federal Government never required the SC IRS to encrypt SSN. Basically saying that we did the minimum required and never strived for perfection, going the extra mile, etc.\n\nNo wonder so many things are falling apart. One would like to think that in the age of the Internet and cyber crime that someone that is tasked with protecting the sensitive information of the citizens of SC will also have their best interest in mind. At least when it comes to something like this.\n\nI live in NC but that is not to say that it could not happen here or any other state. Why don't we try to go the extra mile without having the Federal Government telling the states to do so.\n\nTo Gov. Haley; the blame for this does not belong with the US IRS but with you and you alone. You are responsible for all parts of the SC state government....nobody else. Try to keep that in mind.\n\nHa Ha Ha! I can't stop laughing at the hypocrisy of the same governor who believes in state's rights, smaller government, and hates big bad federal government. And now she complains because the federal government didn't have stronger regulations in place?? Really? Was someone stong-arming her to prevent the state from doing something to safeguard their computer systems? Of course not. Shame innocent people were affected, but oh, the hypocrisy! Nice job Guv.\n\nThe joke is that most companies and individuals have software that prevents people from getting phishing attacks. Sounds like the state is missing even the most basic training and security software.\n\nIt is funny when you talk to government organizations and they don't want to put their information 'in the cloud because of security'. In the cloud the best security in the world is applied, at the government you get professionals who couldn't get a higher paying job elsewhere watching your data. Classic.\n\nEach state 'verifies' with the IRS the numbers that are inserted into your state return. If the IRS couldn't verify because the state info is encrypted then it is useless. How about no income tax and only state and national sales tax... no reason to even file a return; but then a large chunk of the government would be downsized. Looking out for THEIR jobs!\n\nWell, here's the thing, the IRS already has an encryption program. They can send it to the states which will allow the states to encrypt the tax id #s and then send them encrypted to the IRS, which can unencrypt them and verify. Amazing that if you think, solutions can be done.\n\nWhy would the state not encrypt names, addresses, account numbers, virtually everything that is stored on a computer that hackers can get into ?\n\nI can see the lawyers lining up on this one already.\n\nSC is gonna be paying for the next 40 years off of this one. And businesses will be leaving left and right.\n\nFiling a tax return is clunky, unneccassary, and costly to tax filers, and tax agency (IRS) or state revenue agency. I agree with another poster here that we do away with such an unproductive system that costs more to administer- than if we simply used a national sales tax, or flat tax.\n\nYou are only as safe as the dumbest person around you lets you be. That goes for the people that live in your apartment house or neighborhood, share the highways with you. prepares your food, fills your prescriptions or handles your sensitive documents.\n\nTragic. This really constitutes a very serious crime which should be punishable by many decades in prison.\n\nWe need to start handing out 50 year prison sentences for this kind of activity, but good luck on finding the perpetrators of this crime. Heads should definitely roll for this one---starting with the idiot who clicked on the malicious link in the email.\n\nThe malicious emails we get and the attachments are disguised to look like internal emails. Our IT workers are updating every night and we are a huge agency that encrypts SS numbers and other personal information. It is not usually the one worker, its related to staying ahead of the hackers. look what they are doing to the banks. This agency did not have the basic encrytion that they needed . Agency issue. It's amazing how many people think this is one person who messed up.\n\nAs long as our personal information is stored in a data base, any data base, we are each and every one of us vulnerable.\n\nTrue, this was Hayley's responsibility, too. But what many are not getting out of this is: if the federal government had (had already) required encryption of SS numbers from say... years ago (when they truely should have when ID theft was commonplace at least a decade ago), then the safeguards for SS encryption would have alreayd been taken care of. Why just credit card number encryption requirements? SS numbers are much more suseptible than credit card #'s. Sheeeesh! An oversight by the fed's, of course.\n\nSo in essence, its the federal Government's fault, meaning: it's Obama'a fault, too, of course? (yes).\n\nOk folks. Now you see what we South Carolinians have to put up with! A Republican governor, a Republican dominated state legislature, two Republican senators and a majority of Republican representatives. It has been this way for about 20 years. No wonder South Carolina is first in the worst of things and last in the best of things.\n\nHowever, there is also blame to be had on part of the IT personnel responsible for the system in question. There are very simple tools available to stop networked computers from being able to access \"suspicious\" websites, even when clicked from an email link, as well as software the \"removes\" the link itself from the email.\n\nObviously someone higher up on the ladder (maybe Haley) rejected a proposal from IT to implement this type of email\/Internet filtering system. But hey, this is one of the choices that need to be made when \"cutting\" budgets. Someone made a choice, and this time it turned out to be the wrong choice!\n\nUneducated folks underestimate the probability of getting compromised, and over estimate the ability of worker robots to be able to see\/indentify something that is malicious.\n\nThis is a significant failure within company's of all sizes as well as government agency's. Folks think that because they get nothing physical out of buying\/implementing these softwares, that to spend money on it is a waste, until they are the ones that get hacked.\n\nIT infrastructure IS VERY EXPENSIVE to keep up with current technology, but even more expensive NOT too!\n\nHacking is way to easy these days with so many simple ways to get into and compromise computer systems. Heck, a 10 year old kid can simply google, download, install, and use a great many hacking tools without having any expertise in hacking whatsoever!\n\nIf this Tea Bagger\/GOP had been paying attention to what she was elected to do, serve and protect the people of South Carolina, and not in kaniving on how do defeat Obama this probably could have been prevented. In August she was preparing her speach for the RNC. I suggest the citizens of South Carolina impeach her or have a recall. This is TOTAL derelation of her duties. Get rid of her. She is a typical Tea Bagger looser. HOWEVER, SHE IS BLOND SO SHE MAY SURVIVE A RECALL"}
{"text":"Again marking November 5th as a global day of protest, Hacker group Anonymous has released confidential customer information, including 28,000 alleged account passwords that it says came from a hack of PayPal's servers.\n\nMultiple Anonymous Twitter accounts announced the hack, linking to a set of Private Paste documents containing emails, names, and what appear to be possibly passwords from the payment service's database. One paste dump states that it has 27,935 entries from \"mc_customers\" with columns for the passwords (which are coded) and corresponding telephone numbers. Some of the links appear to have been removed at the time of writing, but they were all working at one point.\n\nUpdate 2: PayPal has responded with the following statement:\n\n\"It appears that the exploit was not directed at PayPal after all, it was directed at a company called ZPanel. The original story that started this and was retweeted by some of the Anonymous Twitter handles has now been updated.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Anonymous proclaimed that it would once again hold a protest on November 5th, or Guy Fawkes Night. In addition to cyberattacks, the group has also scheduled a \"march, strike and protest\" in front of the White House in the US and Parliament in the UK tonight to reenact the revolution scene from the movie V for Vendetta.\n\nAlthough November 5th is just getting started in some parts of the world, Anonymous is already taking credit for multiple hacks, including NBC, VMWare, and the defacing of a number of websites around the world.\n\nDiscussion\n\n Debra\n\nHow does stealing innocent peoples passwords make them hero's.\n\nRoger Keulen\n\nThey didn't steal the password's. The \"guy\" \"you\" give your personal information to doesn't giva a shit and didn't \"lock\" the door. Or put it this way: \"THERE WHERE NO DOOR OR WINDOWS IN THE BUILDING !\"\n\nAnd they don't get passwords they just got your personal info.\n\nTiger\n\nWether they stole them or obtained them from a poorly secured vault, the principle is still wrong. Isn't this an organisation that is motivated by people's rights? I don't think this is a good way of demonstrating that? How come everyone is reporting this as stolen passwords? Is that just a claim then or is there evidence?\n\n patrick kanne\n\nyeah, and then posted this online.. why?\n\nIf they DO want to make a difference, howsabout posting the locations where those tax-evading Greeks are that ruined their country? If they DO want to make a difference, why not break down the chinese-firewall? If they DO want to make a difference, why not post the credentials of the directors of nike who insist in child-labor being the only way to make shoes (and billions of dollars for them).\n\nJust to name some examples\u2026\n\nNo, what they do is put OUR personal credentials online so we won't feel save about our funds in the next coming months..\n\nHey, Thanks Anonymus for fighting the good fight, now please drink some industrial grade acid? Asshats..\n\ntrin\n\nunfortunately dear sir, a reporter who did post online the famous Laguard list of potential tax-evading people with accounts in HSBC Switzerland has been prosecuted by the Greek \"democratic\" state\u2026\n\nIf you think that youre retarded. There are ALWAYS 0 day vulnerabilities. There are always holes in a system that big. They have far better security than most.\n\ncheeseballz\n\nInteresting, and why should someone have to shutdown the doors and windows? oh that's right because retards like anonymous who rely on others to post 0dayz publicly and then use this against innocent businesses, degrading the services for millions of innocent bystanders.\n\nWilson\n\nAre there anonymous members accounts in this database? I guest no. What are you fighting anonymous?\n\nAlek\n\nThe question is what do they do with these passwords?\n\nAnon\n\nits not moralefag anon for one lulz maybe its more than likely some jacktard with nothing better to do though paypal is a buncha shitz. I would suggest bitcoin or some other service anyway.\n\n Youtube\n\ni think all of you are not innocent since you guys make war and stealing other people resouces everywhere in this world\n\nAnon\n\nIt just does\n\npeter piper\n\nDoes what precisely? OK have a hack at the big corporates who can easily defend themselves but stealing passwords and openly sharing phone numbers and paypal details is thieving and deceptive! I could almost agree on one hand but when the big\"anonymous\" pick on the regular individuals then they are no better than crooks who need sanctioning! IMHO\n\nAnon\n\nWell, if 28,000 people stop using paypal due to security risks, then Anon will be able to justify the potential misery they have caused innocent people.\n\nThey are \"at war\", so to speak, and there are always casualties.\n\nHowever, no deaths can realistically be attributed to this, so they are not as bad as other activist groups.\n\nJoseph\n\nHow does 28,000 people not using paypal do anything for anything?\n\nThere is no war. Anonymous is a CIA false flag intended to get the technology community to support legislation like SOPA.\n\nThese actions are seeded by the CIA then cyber hooligans with nothing better to do leach onto the initiatives, for their egos.\n\nThis is indefensible by any conception of leftist action. It does nothing but stir the bees nest of anti-internet freedom legislation, which is its obvious purpose. You probably work for the CIA yourself, providing these bogus explanations in order further fan the flame of anti-open internet support.\n\njz100\n\nThey are all scumbags. They do this every single time. Pretend they are fighting for us, yet stab the very same people in the back as they say it. Also what is the point in hacking image shack? A free service.\n\nAnon\n\nSo hold on, what would it take for you to stop using paypal?\n\nIf they wrote you a nice flowery email, would you honestly stop using it?\n\nI'd have more concerns about governments sending troops in to kill and steal other countries resources, to \"keep us safe\"\u2026..\n\nThank the heavens we got to the WMD's in time\u2026. \/sarcasm\n\njoseph\n\nThen why not do something about governments sending troops in to kill and steal in other countries, rather than exposing what for many is that last penny they have, to looters?\n\nRui\n\nOk I don't know how people still honestly think that 'anonymous' isn't any sort of organisation with structure or purpose. It literally is, a few kids (albeit very talented in front of the computer) sat in their bedrooms who have no political ideaology whatsoever doing things for a kick. It's the equivalent of a group of teenagers throwing eggs at a passing bus and saying they were doing it in protest against civil liberties.\n\nrui\n\n*is\n\nAnon\n\nWhy exactly are you riled up over \"a few kids\"?\n\nThere doesn't need to be a \"political ideaology\". People take part in \"events\" that they agree with, and with regard to those who are in it for a kick \u2013 you'll find plenty of people like that (anarchists) in any activist organisation. It is not exclusively Anon who has this issue.\n\nMissTee\n\nif you don't get it, you wont. Anon is for the people to fight back against corrupt governments, corporations. our govts have been lying and deceiving us and it's time for it to stop before it's too late. with the upmost respect I would ask evryone to please educate themselves on what is \"really\" going on in the world, not what the govt owned mainstream media would have you believe. the internet is a very powerful tool that has been allowing us to see what is really going on. it has allowed us to wake up to the fraud and corruption, why else do you think 'they' are so eager to control it? it's because we know. we know, we can see, we have awakened and that is a huge threat to corruption. truth is a scary thing to those who have built themselves upon lies.\nand no, I am neither a kid nor a misguided fool.\n\nit is time to wake up, now, before it is too late.\n\n patrick kanne\n\n\"Anon is for the people to fight back against corrupt governments, \"\n\nAnd they do this by posting OUR passwords and telephone numbers online? WTF? Which government is going to care about this?\nI sure as fuck am NOT going to rally behind a group of asshats who put my personal funds in jeopardy just to make a point to institutes who have more money then I'll be ever able to gather in my lifetime\u2026.\n\nI fail to see how this latest action is going to help anyone\u2026.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, YOU should wake up, but more likely : Grow Up.\n\nJason Hare\n\nFighting back against governments by targeting citizens? Trying working with real activists such as Open Ireland, a group of folks that are pressuring Ireland to support Open Data and transparency. Randomly hacking websites does not shed light on anything except your ability to sniff out security lapses. Try checking out #opendata and #opengovernment and put some of your skills to work. Opening health and welfare data as well as transactional and land use data tells the real story of what local and state level governments are up to. It also has a much greater economic impact than the the few people hired to fix the messes you create. If you preach being open minded try it yourself.\n\nJoseph\n\nAnonymous is a CIA false flag operation intended to scare the technology community into restricting internet free speech and passing corporate welfare legislation for the Music and Movie industries.\n\n patrick kanne\n\nsigh\u2026 another one of those nutjobs. Corporate Welfare Legislation.. Really?\n\nAlso, the technology community is way to diverse and generally well educated to be scared about these things. And this same community has no coordinated powers whatsoever to restrict anything, even if they would like to (which they don't btw). And lastly, this community doesn't pass legislation. Governments do. Idiot.\n\n FrancisJav\n\nWhat a bunch of assholes! They have not any real relevance anymore and now they are just a bunch of trolls spoiling people's activities..\nSo enjoy celebrating a catholic fundamentalist terrorist morons! Thank you for making the web even more insecure in name of an infamous extremist\u2026 wait a minute, that is probably why they relate so much to him! Silly me!\n\n SilverJediShade\n\nSeriously did you not watch the video .tinkde answer waz.. you were warned not to put your info on the site nobody listening.. now sony paying hackers to find cracks\u2026 job creation lol extortionate.. hive quote.. resistance is futile mandatory health care programming mandatory vaccination mandatory chipset you will be assimilated!\n\n patrick kanne\n\ngod.. I hate how people like you rape and mangle language. A trait commonly found in conspiracy-nuts. Really, if you have to say something, try forming coherent sentences. Use punctuation and capitalization.\nIf you can't be arsed to communicate your ideas clearly, why on earth should we put in an effort to read and understand it\u2026? Grow the fuck up.\n\nDahallo Martin\n\nCongrats Anonymous you can steal millions while still in your 3 week old underwear.\n\nRy Ry\n\nAnonymous is a silly group playing a silly child's game. They say they are fighting for OUR rights, yet they openly reveal MY personal information just to try and prove a point? You say these 26,000 \"casualties\" are worth what anonymous is trying to achieve, but they are no different than a terrorist group. If they are doing this for me, then why are they putting my personal information into the public eyes? That wound be like me killing animals just so people can see that animals need to be protected. Yea, if there is anything we need to be protected by it is the idiots who call themselves Anonymous. And about that name: you are not anonymous if you claim responsibility for the action. So yea, great job with making your point clear guys! Now we not only think of you as terrorists, but also as self loathing.\n\nBJ\n\nHackers and Idnenty thieves need to be found and a bullet put between their eyes\u2026 then this nonsense of leaking passwords and personal information that lead to identity theft might end\u2026\n\nJazz\n\nI'm confused as to how this is a form of protest.\n\nHow is this any different than a person who is protesting against McDonalds and does so by spitting on all the burgers when nobody is looking and claims that the food quality control is low by posting pics of them doing it?\n\nPaypal might not be as secure as Anonymous might want it to be, but Paypal does provide some form of minimal security in terms of user privacy. How does subverting that security and then posting the information help?\n\nIt would have made alot more sense if they decided to hack and then changed everybody's birthday to Nov 5th. It would have been a protest that everybody would have appreciated alot more and raise concerns at the same time without leaving anyone at risk.\n\nJust like how spitting on the burgers would probably cause more commotion, it will get the general public to side against the protester and actually overlook the actual health or food quality concerns that McDonalds \"might\" have.\n\nLong story short, Anonymous should have found a way to protest or stick it to the man without hurting the regular guys.\n\n Mauro Ezechiele Grazini\n\nPasswords are encrypted and can't be decrypted, so who cares.. emails, names, phone numbers and so is what they give. That mostly can help big companies and spamers. Zynga is very glad to get that list, they will give more work hours to his employees to get more gifts from moronymous.\nIt's just show off.. all what they do.\n\nAnonSucks\n\nPasswords depending on how they are created can be decrypted, even if it takes some months. they have the time and there isnt much cost.\n\nAnonsucks\n\nIf they are trying to do good and are so smart, why not make the Secure payment site than and offer that as a solution?\n\nit is easy to find flaws, not so easy to be and do good.\n\nfuck anonymous\n\nFinding exploits in software is \"NOT\" hacking\u2026anonymous is a pathetic group.\n\nLaina\n\nIf they want to screw people, just post politic's accounts or criminal's\u2026but why messing with normal innocent people?\n\nLDub\n\nI'm not sure everyone understands that these people are just a bunch of random people, with no leader or direction. Some of the people in this group are good, some of them are touch holes. Thing is, everyone seems to look at them as a group, but really its just a bunch of individual people with different agendas.\n\nanonymous1957\n\nEven though there is no real leader, they still have discussions about who they should target and why. After discussing it, they decide that someone\/something should be attacked because a majority of the members agree. That is how they said they work.\n\nv7DusK\n\nThanks dickheads, I use Paypal but IM ON YOUR SIDE!\nWhat are you trying to prove?\n\ndu mah!\n\nThey didnt just unveil regular folks passwords it was a certain group of people so the people on here who are so distraught by this it probably happened to you for a reason and if it didnt happen to you its because you are irrelevent to this mattter. So dont get your panties in a knot and figure out the truth behind all of it.\n\nAnonSucks\n\nCertain group? wtf are you talking about? my PP was hacked a few days ago. I didn't do shit to Anonymous. I'm just a regular, tax paying, hard working citizen.\n\nanonymous1957\n\nIt really upsets me that everyone here seems to read one article and think that it sums everything up as a whole. In all actuality, PayPal was targeted because they do not allow payments to Wikileaks anymore. However, they will allow people to pay sites that are affiliated with the KKK, neo-nazis, and more! Wikileaks has good intentions and their sole purpose is to leak information that should be available to the public. As far as your PayPal information being stolen, they don't actually do anything with the information\u2026 they simply prove 2 things. One, show that their website is very unsecure and people that do have ill intentions can break in just as easily as Anonymous. Two, they hope to scare people away from PayPal causing them to lose customers\u2026 based on the fact that they are supporting terrible sites, but not Wikileaks (which has a good purpose).\n\nWith all that being said, I am not saying I support Anonymous. I mean, I think they have good intentions, but they are going about it the wrong way. Bottom line is that it bothers me when I see so many comments based off of one short article and they don't know the entire story. All it takes is a little bit of reading and searching to see what is actually going on here.\n\njojo51\n\nThey stole 120 bucks from me. Well someone did. They post the info online for scumbags that follow them to see. So for you to say \"they don't actually do anything with the information..\" Is false. They post it for the public. Then those that want to use it, use it to steal money. It's like a criminal stealing someone's wallet, then leaving the wallet on the table of a seedy bar for anyone to use. So for you to say they are just \"making a point by posting it\" it's more then that. Good intentions or not, it's crime and it hurts innocent citizens. Do you think that all anonymous users don't participate in any of these companies that they are trying to \"protest\"? Give me a break.\n\nanonymous\n\nHonestly, they did this today and you are complaining about something \"they\" did yesterday. People's accounts get hacked all the time. Where is your proof that is was related to the Anonymous situation? Honestly, couldn't someone else have done it? Isn't that a possibility? I am not saying it isn't possible, but you have no proof other than the fact that it happened the day before Anonymous messed with PayPal\n\nAnonymous\n\nThis is simply an attempt to discredit a group that is trying to do some good. People with power always fight change because change means they could lose their power.\n\n Aaron Ladd\n\nGuy Fawkes was a terrorist. Plane and simple.\n\nanonymous1957\n\nAgreed. However, Anonymous is trying to use the movie \"V for Vendetta\" as their bases for the mask and today's date\n\nanonymous\n\n*plain\n\njojo51\n\nOn Sunday November 4th someone used my paypal to purchase a game (Twice). Had to change password, dispute charge, and will close account. Then I read this. No problems before. So seems to be real. Haven't used my paypal account for a long time so no idea how anyone could have gotten in if it wasn't this..\n\nAnonymous\n\n Anonymous\n\nBen Parry\n\nFrom an IS consultant view I think what they are really trying to do \/ protest is the lack of initiative on companies to better secure information. Most companies usually know of issues in the networks or do not protect the network enough because of lack of IT funding. Most companies know about exploits long before an action happens. Its the fact that most companies will not move on anything util its in public domain. Becuase companies choice to ignore issues they put people at risk. In doing what they do I suspect its to prove to the companies after the fact that they sat on information knowing they cheaped out on security or that they took no actions on reports of an exploit. If Hackers did not annouce it the companies would never change it, or call it a system error an cover it up. Wouldnt you want to know a company didnt take action and that a system which is tied to your banks and credit vendors was accessable by others?\n\nanon\n\nits not moralefag anon for one lulz maybe its more than likely some jacktard with nothing better to do though paypal is a buncha shitz. I would suggest bitcoin or some other service anyway.\n\nMichael\n\nTest\n\nBronzeByte\n\nFunny how all the morons actually believe it while they just grabbed 28k passwords and started saying they hacked PayPal.\nPayPal hasn't confirmed it because it never happened, all passwords are hashed in a database behind top-notch security.\nMedia just loves drama, if it didn't, then this big fake\/lie won't be on here\u2026\n\nAnonymous are simply proving what is already feared; many of the sites that people trust are simply not secured, and the data the store is available to anyone who seeks it.\nImagine what the PAYING \"hackers\", advertisers, gov deptartments etc are getting out of sites like paypal, itunes, facebook and others. There is minimal rights and privacy on the net!\nThe only difference is these sites make money from the paid backdoors, but not from groups like anonymous.\nSmart users should be changing their passwords and other information regularly anyway so information like this that is freely available is worthless!\nHow many times have these sites been hacked, when it HASN'T been reported?\n\nAnonSucks\n\nMaybe they can make a point about insecure sites like PP without stealing my money. I'd appreciate it.\n\nMy PP PW was secure and changed often, and I didn't get phished. Nope. they just helped themselves to my money.\n\nAwesome. What a great, progressive, for the people group.\n\n Rebecca Trotter\n\nThey are claiming that they weren't hacked but my account has been locked and they are demanding to know why someone accessed my account from Iran and want me to prove I'm not a front for someone in Iran. I live in Wisconsin! I've provided a Photo ID, proof of address, confirmed my accounts and changed my password \u2013 all at their request. And they still haven't cleared my account. I'm calling bull. They were hacked and are hiding it.\n\nLolking\n\nWho fucking cares\n\nAnonymousCIA\n\nAnonymous has declared a war againt the People , fear the Real People anonymous ,we dont forget nerver forgive we are power\n\nmouhamed amine smida\n\nheey can eny one teatch me how to hack a paypal account !!!!\n\nplzZ\n\nrallylife\n\nthey are an oxymoron\n\noknahs\n\nSomeone got into my pay pal acct and charged a prepaid cell phone which was shipped to a FL location. I worked with Paypal for two months to get my account credited. I changed my pass word and I am thinking about cancelling my paypal acct. They said this happen all the time and believe me that sure sounds like security is lacking. My acct was hacked in Oct 2012.\n\nAnon Wibble\n\nPaypal just ripped me off 360 quid today because of a paypal chargeback scam. Basically the only proof of receipt that a buyer has received the item is a post office receipt. So if you sell something on ebay or deliver a car or something else that doesn't go through recorded delivery, guess what, at any point over the next 3 months you can claim to paypal that you never received the item and paypal will give the buyer a refund and let them keep the item they bought, and there is nothing whatsoever the seller can do about it.\n\nWhat happened today put me out of business. I am now in debt, and I am no longer going to be selling on ebay or using paypal.\n\nAs far as I am concerned what Anonymous did here was HEROIC. It highlights a problem with paypal ripping sellers off by having stupid policies. It highlights how they are totally exempt and above the law and the more people draw attention to paypay for this, and ebay for supporting paypal.\n\nGo anonymous!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also change your paypal password, it only takes a few seconds."}

It is proposed that within the next five years, the government will develop an integrated cyber policy and operations approach, meaning we could see a broader and more unified cybersecurity policy approach covering a range of areas such as cyber safety, critical infrastructure protection and resilience managed under a single strategic policy theme.\n\nThe Australian Government's strategy acknowledges the threat of cyber espionage and foreign interference and the threat to \"classified government information; commercial information with direct consequences for business and the economy; intellectual property; and the private information of Australian citizens\".\n\nThis is a major acknowledgement that cyber threats now impact every Australian and have become an issue not only for governments but for individuals and their online information.\n\nThe need to \"Strengthen the resilience of Australia's people, assets, infrastructure and institutions\" against cyber attacks has also been recognised. This means the issue is not just one of protecting against cyber attacks, but also the ability to rebuild systems quickly after a cyber attack and minimise their impact.\n\nTied up with the new strategy was the announcement of the creation of a new Australian Cyber Security Centre which will be in operation by the end of 2013 and which aims to improve partnerships between government and industry.\n\nThis will combine the existing Defence's Cyber Security Operations Centre, the Attorney-General's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Australia, ASIO's Cyber Espionage Branch and parts of the AFP's High-Tech Crime unit into a single centre hopefully allowing for a faster sharing of information between government and industry.\n\nThe centre will have the ability to protect against new and developing cyber security threats in real time and allow for information to be shared quickly, so any cyber risks can quickly be mitigated. This is a major step forward in the cyber protection of Australia.\n\nWe have also seen the Australian Government accept the need for international cooperation to deal with cyber threats, and the need to expand Australia's cooperation with the United States of America in the cyber domain in terms of sharing information, being part of joint training exercises, and coordinating cyber defence responses.\n\nMany critics dismiss the cyber threat to Australia as being \"hype or overstated\", but that is far from the truth. In 2007, cyber attacks on Estonia resulted in the failure of Estonia's online infrastructure; in 2010, we saw the development of Stuxnet malware (in this case a worm) that had the ability to disrupt certain types of SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems that support key industrial systems, such as power supplies and water treatment facilities.\n\nIn Australia, 438 cyber incidents occurred between 2011-12 which required a significant response by the Australian Government, Cyber Security Operations Centre; and in 2012, we saw the hacking group Anonymous steal personal information of hundreds of thousands of Australian AAPT customers and disclose that information online.\n\nWhile this strategy might be a positive move by the current Government, future governments will need to ensure adequate funding for the Australian Cyber Security Centre and ongoing related activities.\n\nWhile funding is important, the human resource consideration is essential. The Australian Computer Society has highlighted IT skills shortages in a number of areas including cyber security, and they have highlighted the decline in Australian students studying information systems and information technology at Australian universities. Appropriate steps would have to be taken to address the current and future skill shortages.\n\nThe Australian Federal Government's announcement is a positive step towards protecting Australian against current and future cyber security threats. The Strong and Secure: A Strategy for Australia's National Security is a high level vision, however, and we can expect further details to be forthcoming over the next few months - as always, the devil is in the detail.\n\nMatthew Warren is a Professor of Information Systems at Deakin University.

It would be nice if they also published a few guidelines about how they intend to use, and most importantly, not use this stuff. No I'm not paranoid but the establishment of all this tech glory gives the government an ideal tool for domestic spying as well as all the good things they're promoting.\n\nMycal :\n\n25 Jan 2013 5:53:57pm\n\n\".\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine because it's highly unlikely. Most of the critical systems mentioned here won't have connections to the internet so the hackers have no way in. That it does happen is a testament to stupidty and lack of security awareness of the administrators of those systems.\n\nYou want to protect your data, don't put it on the internet or systems with connections to the internet!\n\nC3PO :\n\n25 Jan 2013 5:50:55pm\n\nActually, the devil is in the FUNDING\n\nWhile I agree that cyber security is necessary, I have very serious reservations abt the creation of yet another govt agency. Just like the Y2K doomsday prophecies, this proposed Australian Cyber Security Centre will be another great sinkhole where billions of taxpayers dollars will simply dissapear into \"integrated cyber policy and operations....more unified cybersecurity policy......cyber safety, critical infrastructure protection and resilience\" Say What????\n\nYes, all this techno gobbledegook is exactly like lawyerspeak. A language which ordinary folks simply don't understand but are afraid to ask for being seen as simple or too afraid to inquire in detail for fear of being seen as unsophisticated. So we pay without asking in the illusion that the \"experts & professionals\" really know what they are doing and the lawyers & computer engineers will rake in billions to give us all that false sense of security that Australia can really stop the likes of China or the USA (which alledgedly launched a cyber attack on Iran) if those countries really wanted to conduct a cyber offensive on us. Yeah, right.\n\nThese so called ACSC experts will end up buying $1 cyber locks from our pal, the USA and then bill us $1000 for their \"expertise\". But these locks of course won't stop anyone, Chinese or American for 1 second. You're fooling yourselves if you believe otherwise.\n\nPeter of Melbourne :\n\n25 Jan 2013 5:39:41pm\n\n\"While this strategy might be a positive move by the current Government, future governments will need to ensure adequate funding for the Australian Cyber Security Centre and ongoing related activities.\"\n\nor else they can privatise it to the highest Chinese bidder or as an alternative contract it out to the cheapest offshore Chinese\/Indian\/Russian bidder. as any of our politicians would be the first to tell you \"problem solved!\"\n\nHudson Godfrey :\n\n25 Jan 2013 4:57:28pm\n\nSure it all sounds black and white, but when asking for our support do remember to tell us what accountability you're going to have to show for it. Thus far the dry statistics aren't backed by any arrests trials of judgements that we're aware of. So apparently the most important resource we have is something we've very little right to take any direct interest in? Why so?"}

By cloud city \u2013 he is talking about the online storage or server on which all the software, video, files and other data is hosted. By the rain \u2013 he meant various different things such as server hacking, server downtime etc.\n\nHe is using words like cloud city, rain etc. to explain technical information to people who are illiterate about technology world.\n\nServers can be hacked. Sony's PlayStation network (cloud computer) was hacked and taken by hackers for over one month. hackers released it.\n\nMany of the websites were hacked into. Gmail was hacked by chinese hackers. they took out all the names, emails and confidential information.\n\nI don't know about information being recorded after upto an hour of conversation over the air and board of directors' room being locked for an hour after conversation. I know that sound travels through air. And there are a lot of softwares and machines that can hack, record conversations over the air. you don't need to be in the room to do that.\n\nHe is talking correct about arrest. listen, it happens in america. it is similar to identity theft. when accounts are hacked, people's information can be changed or stolen on the servers. people have gone to jail for other people's crimes. There is a huge underground black market on the internet where stolen identity information is bought.\n\nI think that Vishwa meant to say mobile phone's memory instead of battery.\nAbout battery information hack. this is possible and can happen in the future. modern batteries contain their own firmware and microcontrollers to monitor power levels, allowing operating systems to check and respond accordingly.\nFrom examining Apple's computers, scientists noticed that all the embedded chips in the batteries used the same default passwords. This means that a hacker who knows of the password can find a way to control the chip's firmware and in turn manipulate the battery to wreak havoc on your system.\n\nNot all companies or mobile phone makers but all big companies in America ask their executives and even employees to destroy their hard disks, mobile phones and printers after use to prevent leaking of information.\n\nIt looks like, Kunal has lost its mind and thus supporting Vishwa bandhu Gupta. Whatever u said is correct but don't waste your intelligence in supporting his worthless crap.

Now imagine you find out that someone or some people have taken advantage of a security flaw that would jeopardize all your hard work. Cyber security may seem like a topic covered in most far-out sci-fi films, but the reality is, we are all venerable to a cyber attack. The landscape of the business world is changing and it this change come new threats to the well being of our companies and brand names. Many will not take into account the consequences of a cyber attack until after they've actually experienced one but with more and more companies taking to the Internet to reach their audience, cyber security should be much closer on the companies' to-do list.\n\nUnlike a traditional security risk, cyber attacks can take many forms and cause an array of harm. For example, a companies website can be taken over by an individual for the sole purpose of extortion. The cyber attacker will contact the company and let them know they can regain control but only after some extortion fee is paid. Another form of attack is aimed against the consumer. Once a potential client logs onto a affected website, their computer may be compromised. In this case, anytime the potential consumer enters a search on a search engine, like Google or Bing, the results they are shown will be tampered to the liking of the cyber attacker.\n\nAlthough cyber security isn't as big of a problem for many companies as \"realworld\" threats, it doesn't mean it can't be. The landscape of the business world is changing and with more companies taking to the Internet to broadentheir bases, cyber security should be as relevant as a brand reputation.\n\nPlease contact us today for more information and quotes for Cyber Liability today!"}

{"text":"Data Thieves Unlikely to Freeze Your PC\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCalling it the \"popsicle hack,\" a PC market analyst is throwing cold water on concerns that computers are widely vulnerable to a new security breach. Princeton researchers (.pdf) drew widespread attention when they said that freezing a computer's memory chips preserves data that normally disappear when a computer is turned off. Someone who chills the chips can retrieve data after the PC has been powered down.\n\nRoger Kay of Endpoint Technologies makes the process sound at least far-fetched and maybe laughable in the real world. Someone would have to have access to a notebook when it's running or sleeping (not turned off) and then spray liquid nitrogen to freeze the chips. Then the thief would have to abscond with the memory sticks to another machine to sniff out the precious data\u2014and return to the target machine to apply the revealed password. Only then could the bad guy open an encrypted hard drive.\n\nWhile possible, the attack remains much less likely than much more mundane methods of cracking a computer, Kay says. \"Anyone who knows the security biz knows that there is no such thing as absolute security, only reasonable security for a given situation,\" he adds. \"Commercial-grade security is good enough for most businesses, but spooks need a higher grade.\"\n\nSo maybe James Bond has to worry about keeping his laptop out of the freezer.

{"text":"Recent Issue - March 2012\n\nA Comparative Study of Cyberattacks\n\nSeung Hyun Kim, Qiu-Hong Wang, Johannes B. Ullrich\n\nMarch 1, 2012\n\nCyberattacks are computer-to-computer attacks undermining the confidentiality, integrity, and\/or availability of computers and\/or the information they hold.a The importance of securing cyberspace is increasing, along with the sophistication and potential significance of the results of the attacks. Moreover, attacksb involve increasingly sophisticated coordination among multiple hackers across international boundaries, where the aim has shifted from fun and self-satisfaction to financial or military gain, with clear and self-reinforcing motivation; for example, the number of new malicious code threats worldwide increased more than 71% from 2008 to 2009.14\n\nKey Insights\n\nThe worldwide effort to safeguard against attacks seems to lack coordination and collaboration. The majority of cybercriminals go unpunished, with their skills often exceeding those of the international authorities responsible for stopping them.8 One economic barrier to information security is the presence of \"externalities\"1; an example of a negative externality is when a computer infected by a virus harms other computers in the same network, and a positive externality is when a security breach targeting specific software with a large installed base is disclosed, possibly alerting other users and preventing further loss due to being attacked. In economics, positive externalities drive economic agents to invest less than would be socially desirable, even when protection is technically feasible. Among countries, one country's effort in terms of enforcement and investment in security infrastructure makes other countries more secure by reducing the number of attacks originating from within its borders. Alternatively, attackers who are themselves threatened may virtually relocate to other countries. Such externalities inhibit achievement of a globally desirable level of country-level investment and enforcement action.\n\nInformation security is recognized as both a technical issue and a critical policy and business issue.10 The presence of externalities in information security scenarios requires international collaboration among national governments.7 The Convention on Cybercrime (Europe Treaty Series No. 185),c adopted by the Council of Europe, November 23, 2001, was the first and is still the most important international treaty focused on cybercrimes, aiming to \"set up a fast and effective regime of international cooperation.\"d As of January 2012, 32 countries have ratified the Convention, though 17 member countries have not.e Li wrote, \"The pressure against not ratifying the treaty coming from inside the countries seems to be a greater obstacle than the differences over the drafting of the document.\"5\n\nThe first step toward improving international collaboration is to understand the nature of the attacks, with respect to national demographics and international policy. For instance, cybersecurity research by ISPs has sought to identify organizations hosting abnormally high levels of malicious content.4,13 While industry-based research and recommendations on information security (such as Symantec Internet Security Threat Reports and Microsoft Security Intelligence Reports) are publicly accessible, they tend to focus on the technical aspect of cyberattacks rather than on their effects on policy and business. Therefore, more information about countries hosting malicious activity is required, including how attacks are distributed and correlated among them, and how these security statistics link to national demographics and international policy.\n\nThis article explores the nature and scope of cyberattacks originating from a number of countries, analyzing SANS Institute country-level intrusion-detection samples, 2005\u20132009. The SANS Institute established the Internet Storm Center (ISC  in 2001, aiming to assist ISPs and end users to safeguard themselves against cyberattacks. The ISC monitors the kind of data-collection, analysis, and warning systems used in weather forecasting. The DShield data set used by ISC is a collection of network-security logs from its voluntary subscriber base throughout the Internet. Each DShield contributor reports information about the source of an attack whenever an alert is sounded by its firewall. Given its worldwide coverage, the DShield dataset provides a relatively accurate representation of malicious traffic, as detected by hundreds of networks.12 Though the logs are not comprehensive enough to fully disclose specific types of attacks and the location of the original attacker(s), it does show the aggregate selection of sources from where the attacks might have originated. Following the rational-choice theory in classic criminology,6 criminals make decisions to maximize their net return by weighing potential costs and benefits. Any country with abundant resources and porous borders is likely to become the sanctuary for cyberattacks; hence, the nature of the DShield dataset fits well with our research interests.\n\nOur analysis of country-level data yielded three important lessons (described in the following sections) that could be a foundation for further collaboration and coordination among countries:\n\nLesson 1. Identify the top sources of attacks from demographic characteristics. Ranking countries by number of attacks based on the SANS data (see Figure 1) is similar to that published by Symantec Corporation.14,15 The distribution of cyberattacks skews heavily toward certain countries; the SANS data shows that the top 10 (20) countries accounted for 74.3% (87.3%) of the total number of global attacks in 2009. Thus the top countries may be considered more responsible than other countries for the rampant cyberattacks.\n\nHowever, the volume of attacks alone cannot be used to identify relative likelihood of threats and guide international collaboration. Logically, the number of cyberattacks originating from any single country is related to development of its information infrastructure, Internet penetration, and domestic population.5 This correlation leads to the formation of three additional indices of top origin after adjusting for economic development (see Figure 2a), population (Figure 2b), and number of Internet users (Figure 2c), respectively (see Table 1).f These indices are useful indicators for identifying threats previously ignored due to being hidden within the enormous volume of attacks. In these indices, the highest-ranking countries in terms of number of originating attacks are encouraged to improve their information-security infrastructure and enhance legal enforcement against attacks, as well as against the heaviest attack generators by volume. We find substantial differences across the three indices, which seem to complement one another. Zimbabwe (ignored in other indices) is identified as the top source of attacks per capita; Estonia, Latvia, and Slovenia are also more important threats than is indicated by attack volume alone.g Likewise, the attacks per GDP PPP (purchasing power parity) reveals potential threats from Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Estonia, Jordan, and Latvia, and attacks-per-Internet-user includes Bangladesh and Slovenia.\n\nHowever, none of these demographic factors alone fully explains the variation in cyberattacks among countries. Hence, we conduct a simple regression to identify additional countries with an inherently large volume of attacks that cannot be explained by standard demographic parameters. The following formula represents a regression model, with each variable representing the ratio over its global level on an annual basis\n\nwhere a residual term equals the observed proportion of attacks minus the proportion predicted by the evaluated parameters and captures the component that cannot be justified by economic development, population, and Internet penetration.h Thus, a positive residual indicates attacks beyond expectations originating from a country relative to the global average; a negative residual indicates fewer attacks than expected; the top countries can be identified by residuals, as in Table 1. Table 1 also lists countries among the top 20 by total attack volume, to which the regression model attributes the most overestimated attacks; the residual term is a large negative. These countries might indicate possible overrepresentation when applying the volume-based approach alone. The U.S. is most frequently among the top 10. In addition, most of the top countries (based on total attack volume), except China, have signed or ratified the Convention, including France, the Netherlands, and the U.S., and most countries in which the number of hosted attacks is below the global average have likewise signed or ratified. Among them, the number of attacks originating from France, Japan, and the U.K. was below the global average in the years (2005\u20132009) we surveyed, despite their considerable economic development, population, and Internet penetration. Canada and Spain, which were both at the top for volume of originating attacks in 2005 with an extraordinary number of attacks, surprisingly generated fewer cyberattacks than the global average in 2009. Moreover, three of the nine overrepresented countries in 2009 in Table 1\u2014Canada, Japan, and Poland\u2014were among the 13 countries that signed the Convention in 2005 (or earlier) but still have not ratified it. Due to the number of attacks below the global average, these countries may not have as much incentive to join as other developed countries. In contrast, some countries with negligible total attack volume were among the top 20, 2005\u20132009, with an extraordinary number of attacks, including Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. The number of such underrepresented countries increased from two in 2005 to six in 2009, with none signing the Convention.\n\nThese observations reflect the international divide and dynamics of attack sources associated with the Convention. First, the top-origin countries, having developed economies, are more likely to accede to the Convention, though they remain sanctuaries of cyberattacks and potential cyberattackers, even after ratification of the Convention, including Germany and the U.S. Second, developing countries that have not ratified the Convention host disproportionately more attacks and potential attackers than would otherwise be projected from their economic development, population, and Internet penetration. Consequently, while the benefit of joining the Convention is not reflected in the top lists of attack origins, there is a spillover effect on countries that have not joined. In fact, such an international divide on international collaboration motivates attackers to launch attacks due to the risk advantage from facilitating worldwide network connectivity. Developing countries have relatively poor information-security infrastructure and insufficient resources for deterring cyberattacks.5 As a result, the lower risk of launching cyberattacks from them may attract attackers seeking sources that leverage the risk advantage.\n\nOverall, the combination of total attack volume and demographic characteristics reveals inherently high threat levels of cyberattacks in certain countries, partly negating responsibility of countries that may be overrepresented in terms of total attack volume.\n\nLesson 2. Global diffusion trend across regions, not countries. The world has flattened across regions in terms of sources of cyberattacks. We employed the Herfindahl index to examine this phenomenon, a commonly used measure of industry concentration calculated for any given year by H = \u03a3NiS2i, where N denotes the number of countries and Si is the share of country i out of total attacks. Based on the Herfindahl index, Figure 3 reflects a diffusion trend of attacks globally and across regions. The decreasing Herfindahl index indicates the diffusion of attacks across regions, and is consistent with global diffusion. However, global diffusion in cyberattacks did not spread evenly across all countries. Rather, attacks within Asia and Africa have become more concentrated over time, while the Herfindahl index for European countries did not vary from 2005 to 2009. That concentration was led by the surge in share of attacks originating from a few countries (see Table 2). Interestingly, most countries listed in Table 2 have still not ratified the Convention (except Romania and Belgium) and are listed in Table 1 as the top countries with extraordinary attacks in 2009.\n\nThe global-diffusion trend across regions, not countries, manifests through manipulation of attack sources by attackers. While the world is highly connected through the Internet, cybercriminal legislation and jurisdiction sometimes stops at national borders. This limited coverage facilitates \"risk arbitrage,\" with attackers able to commit cyberattacks with relatively low risk of government enforcement by exploiting the divide between domestic legislation and jurisdiction. As a result, attackers expand their attack sources (such as botnets) while focusing on countries with underdeveloped information-security infrastructures.\n\nLesson 3. Considerable interdependence of global trends and compelling substitution effect. Interdependence represents another major weakness concerning cyberattacks at the country level; we define interdependence as the co-movement of attacks between countries. Positive correlation between cyberattacks originating from two countries represents movement in the same direction, while negative correlation represents movement in opposite directions. Interdependence is measured by the correlation of the weekly global proportions of attacks between any pair of countries. This method helps tease out co-movement in attacks between two countries due to the global trend; for example, our factor analysis found that for the top 16 countries ever listed as a top-10 country for attack origin (2005\u20132009), 49% of attacks could be explained by a single (general) factor that can be labeled \"global co-movement.\"i\n\nAfter ruling out the grand global trend, we still observed a high level of positive interdependence between given pairs of countries.j The pair-wise correlations (based on volume and proportion of attacks, respectively) between the U.S. (a dominant source among countries identified as harboring malicious activity) and other countries (2005\u20132009) are outlined in Figures 4a and 4b. Using correlation of shares of attacks, the correlation between the U.S. and other countries, as in Figure 4b, dramatically decreased compared to the correlation of attack volume in Figure 4a. In Figure 4b, France is seen as having the highest pair-wise correlation (0.53) with the U.S. Other countries with positive correlations above 0.30 with the U.S. include the Philippines (0.39), Slovenia (0.38), Estonia (0.36), and Singapore (0.35) in descending order of correlation, respectively. We also confirmed positive pair-wise interdependence as stronger among certain countries, including Japan and South Korea (0.65).\n\nDespite considerable global co-movement, as in Figure 4a, Colombia was negatively correlated with the U.S. (-0.40). We found significant negative correlations between the U.S. and several countries, even after adjusting the denominator to reduce possible overestimation of pair-wise interdependence.k While Lesson 2 on global diffusion revealed that attack sources might disproportionately concentrate in certain countries, Lesson 3 on interdependence suggests that some attack sources might simultaneously substitute other attack sources.\n\nPositive interdependence in cyberattacks results directly from the most general technique applied in a cyberattack: First, the attacker communicates hacking experience and skills via online forums, helping other attackers exploit software vulnerabilities simultaneously. Second, computers in various locations might be compromised, thus becoming part of a botnet, or zombie network. A botnet consisting of more distributed computers could leverage the economies of scale in operational cost and increase the chance of successful attacks. Thus, attackers (such as botmasters) might initiate attacks from multiple countries by controlling millions of infected computers. Finally, malicious code (such as Trojans and worms) could propagate across networks through Internet traffic, data exchange, and access.\n\nIn contrast, negative interdependence in cyberattacks is probably related to the displacement effect identified by Png et al.9 that the announcement by the U.S. government on enforcement against cybercriminals could indirectly increase the number of attacks originating from other countries. That is, to avoid increased risk of punishment in the U.S., attackers are thus motivated to relocate their botnets from there to other countries with lower risk.\n\nThough specific types of collaboration and countermeasures may differ with respect to positive and negative interdependence, improved international collaboration is essential. Positive interdependence may be reduced through improved implementation of the Convention on Cybercrime, while negative interdependence may require improved country-to-country collaboration to minimize the incentive to shift attacks between countries.\n\n75 Countries\n\nBased on SANS Institute daily reports on country-level intrusion detection (2005\u20132009), our study applied the economic indices to analysis of the volume of cyberattacks originating from 75 countries, with coverage limited by the availability of data. For example, no observations were reported from countries with DShield contributors, as the DShield dataset was subject to errors and noise due to misconfiguration of network intrusion and detection systems and false reports.12\n\nOur analysis of country-level data yielded three important lessons that may provide a foundation for further collaboration and coordination among countries. The diffusion and interdependence trend of cyberattacks (Lessons 2 and 3) (2005\u20132009) highlights the importance of international cooperation and implementation of policies in fighting cyberattacks. However, the present cooperation in detection, investigation, and prosecution both domestically and internationally, including the Convention, is insufficient for relieving the worldwide threat to information security. This limitation is evidenced by the extraordinary ongoing surge in cyberattacks originating from certain countries and the persistence of attacks from other countries at the top of the list (Lesson 1).\n\nUnfortunately, incentives for countries to join the Convention are limited due to concern over the cost of legal cooperation and invasion of national sovereignty.5,7 Apart from Canada, Japan, and the U.S., most countries signing the Convention are members of the European Union. Without worldwide agreement, attackers are free to leverage the risk advantage in countries outside the Convention with poor information security infrastructures. These countries (identified by our analysis) represent hidden sources behind the top sources of cyberattack origin based on total attack volume (such as Bangladesh and Columbia).\n\nUnfortunately, incentives for countries to join the Convention are limited due to concern over the cost of legal cooperation and invasion of national sovereignty.\n\nFor countries in compliance with the Convention, positive externalities in information security limits incentives to cooperate at the expected level.7 Thus, it is not strange that Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands hosted an extraordinary number of attacks, given they fully complied with the Convention (Lesson 1). Furthermore, insufficient effort maintaining information security and enforcement may exacerbate global security threats due to negative externalities.\n\nNational Responsiblity\n\nBased on this discussion and our observations, we suggest the following steps for national governments worldwide:\n\nMeasurement. First, in order to create an effective mechanism to tackle cybercrime, they need precise measurement of cyberattacks originating from each country, something generally missing from any road map on international collaboration. Indeed, such an approach would help address the ex ante incentive of international collaboration and ex post incentive of sufficient inputs.\n\nThe state of attack deterrence today recasts a well-known principle involving software quality: \"You can't control what you can't measure.\"2 Lack of widely accepted, reliable, stable measurement of the number of cyberattacks originating from each country inhibits understanding a particular country's rights and liabilities in relieving the global threat to information security.\n\nThe DShield database may provide a feasible baseline to motivate and strengthen international collaboration on information security. We may refer to the global debate on carbon-dioxide emission control, which likewise incorporates the characteristics of externalities. For instance, global carbon-dioxide emissions are effectively controlled by incorporating the infrastructure and economic state of countries with statistical estimates of emissions from multiple organizations.3,16 In the cyberattack context, a similar \"charge\" may be issued to each country, depending on responsibility and demographic status.\n\nResponsibility. Second, given the cross-border aspects of cyberattacks, we stress national responsibility of countries that might host compromised computers, possibly involving intermediate cyberattacks launched by foreign perpetrators. Unlike the sources of carbon emissions, which may be traced, measurement of cyberattacks originating from individual countries includes attacks unconsciously hosted by compromised computers in one country while the physical location of hackers is elusive, as reflected in DShield data. In such a case, the country is actually an intermediary facilitating cyberattacks. For instance, the notable increase in malicious-code ranking for Brazil in 2009 compared to previous years was actually due to the Downadup worm infecting a large number of computers in Brazil.14 As intermediaries bear less responsibility than victims for a loss due to a cyberattack, there is less incentive to avoid becoming an intermediary than a victim. In order to reach an optimal level of investment in global information security, any measurement must take into account the number of cyberattacks passing through a particular country.\n\nCollaboration. Third, based on any available measurement of cyberattacks, the indices we adopted in our study provide further insight when selecting partner countries for regional collaboration. Top countries listed by both \"total volume\" and \"extraordinary number of attacks\" represent a much greater threat to global information security than other countries. Their participation is thus crucial to collaborative enforcement, as with Denmark and the U.S. in Table 1. Top countries with surged shares of cyberattacks that might otherwise be ignored due to their negligible volume reflect the movement of underground forces committing cyberattacks, as with Colombia and Romania in Table 2. Finally, the high correlation among groups of countries in cyberattacks may indicate the countries' participation in hacker activity, including zombie networks, and network traffic. Their joint commitment and participation is thus required to deter cybercriminals.\n\nConstitutional conflict. Fourth, as it is difficult to achieve global collaboration in information security quickly, priority must be given to more critical information-security issues and certain developing countries; for example, some provisions in the Convention might conflict with constitutional principles of certain countries. The Convention takes a broad view, including cybercrimes that, though important, are less related to cyber hacking (such as copyright and child pornography) but might run counter to constitutional law. It is permissible for parties to the Convention to modify their obligations on a limited number of the Convention's Articles; for instance, the U.S. has \"taken a partial reservation to the Jurisdiction article (Article 22, Jurisdiction) because it does not as a general matter assert jurisdiction over crimes committed by U.S. citizens abroad (see the U.S. Department of Justice home page \n\nIt is important to assert which articles and provisions are more critical for cybersecurity against hacking and should be prioritized or strongly mandated. Otherwise, the full benefit of legal harmonization is simply not possible. Regarding prioritization, we identified certain developing countries that generate more attacks disproportionate to their economic development. They may promise higher return on investment in improving the state of global cybersecurity compared to other developing countries but lack sufficient resources and the technical foundation to comply with the standard required by the Convention. The benefit of joining the Convention for these countries is relatively low because their national industrial infrastructure is less dependent on a network economy. For them participation should thus be prioritized with appropriate technical and\/or financial support. The Convention has supported multiple projects to guide developing countries but has concentrated on Eastern Europe.\n\nConclusion\n\nAn alternative approach to worldwide cybersecurity beyond these four suggestions is to adopt the view introduced by Schj\u00f8lberg and Ghernaouti-H\u00e9lie11 that \"A Treaty or a set of treaties at the United Nations level on cyber security and cyber crime should be a global proposal for the 2010s that is based on a potential for consensus.\"11 The Convention is still viewed by most countries outside Europe as a regional initiative, though full benefit of legal cooperation is possible only when all the countries ratify any treaty in light of the strong interdependence of cyberattacks across countries.\n\nWe hope our suggestions trigger a fruitful discussion that enhances the state of international collaboration and legal harmonization.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Ivan Png at the National University of Singapore (NUS) for helpful advice and for financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of China (71001042) and the Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund, NUS (R-253-000-089-112).

We excluded countries with relatively few computers (<400,000 in 2005); they also generally have relatively low economic development and would possibly inflate our indices due to their small denominators. Likewise, the samples from these countries in the SANS dataset are less stable than those from other countries.\n\ng. Rankings of these countries changed by 20 or more places compared to their rankings based on attack volume. We chose countries with populations of more than one million to eliminate high rankings due to small denominators; likewise, we excluded countries with GDP PPP <$25 million and number of Internet users <800,000, 2005\u20132009.\n\nh. As the three variables correlate with one another, estimates of coefficients are less precise, so are not reported. Despite such correlations, we are better off including these factors to obtain residuals they do not explain; R-squared values for all estimated models are >85%.\n\ni. Vulnerability embedded in a dominant software platform could expose millions of computers to security threats.\n\nj. Our measure of pairwise interdependence is conservative, as it might underestimate positive interdependence; an increase in one country's share from a surge in attacks originating from within its borders decreases other countries' shares of attacks worldwide, with the denominator becoming greater for all other countries.\n\nk. Overestimation on negative interdependence is due to the same reason as in footnote j; hence, we use the global-attack volume minus the attacks originating from within the U.S. as the denominator to calculate approximate global shares of attacks from all countries other than the U.S., then examine their correlation with the U.S. global share, respectively. The extent of negative correlation between the U.S. and other countries is smaller than before the adjustment but stays at the same level; countries in descending correlation order include Romania (-0.48), Peru (-0.40), Colombia (-0.39), Australia (-0.33), and Denmark (-0.32).\n\nTables"}

How to visualize key information for decision makers? The talk of Joe Parry argued that visualisations and infographics play a very important role, not only for analytical processes of data analysts, but also for explaining the analytical results to decision-makers at the highest of levels.\n\nSome care must be taken to avoid various common pitfalls when designing such visuals: the talk will cover bad examples as well as good in order to uncover design guidelines and practical advice for those wishing to pursue a more visual approach.\n\nin that sense, Joe Parry initiated his keynote that these visualization tools are specially important for law enforcement and National Security. In that sense he recalled an old saying \" a good sketch is better than a long speech\".\n\nWhat is visualitation? asked Parry to the conferencists. Well , a good visualitation does not consist in just good pictures.\n\nAbout graphs and numbers, Parry said that the use of interactive data and vissualy representation of data is used to amplify cognition. Parry briefly described how a good visualization helps in the Intel analysis. Described some common pitfalls in data visualization. he recommend the reading of the book written by Westell, Duncan and Weeks on visualization in Intel analyIntel analysissis.\n\nParry also described a model of intelligence analyzing processes. The final product of such analysis is a report.\n\nIn the reports, he does not recommend the use of colours to describe the visual variables. He recommend the use of Kinley Visual variables.\n\nTo start the visualization of the Analysis in its low phase, Parry mentioned the visualization of pattern of life, but said this is a analytical tool, not a decission tool. He also said that this analysis must be simplified, not use numbers.\n\nDuring his keynote speech, Joe Parry showed a photograph of former President George Bush looking a wall full of sketches with the networks and interrelations of all individual terrorists participants in the attacks of September 9\/11. It was a very confusing material, President Bush was looking at in this photo. Not the best intelligence visualization report. President Bush was not looking in the photo at a screen with the three followings ingredients that are important in any report: geovisualization, timeline visualization and network visualization.\n\nParry said, that if only using that photo, it was impossible for former President Bush tot ake any intelligence decission, because there is no report, but only information.\n\nIn things not to do, Joe Parry also told participants that it is no good to put pies in the reports, neither 3D presentations. The intelligence reports for decission makers must avoid the use of colour since there is often a color blind among the public. He recommends not to use labels, simplicity instead of complexity, no use of black backgrounds, no use of pie charts, not use of misleading scales.\n\nJoe Parry showed enthusiasm while talking about the infographics reports of the New York Times NYT. He said the NYT infographics show all needed info to understand what is happening.\n\nSummarizing, Parry described some of what he called as \" design guidelines\" for any Intel report, like first an overview, always aim for clarity, show context, show how the situation has changed, make comparison easy, all visual elements must be backed by data, and that the report should be so clear and convincing that the decission makers will act backed by the report.\n\nTo know more about the subject, Joe Parry from Cambridge Intelligence mentioned some sites that can be of interest like:\n\nFinally, Joe Parry ended his keynote speech saying to all participants: \"Back Up everything you say!\"\n\nJoe Parry\u00b4s email address is joe@cambridge-intelligence.com\n\nHis twitter is @parry_joe\n\nPhone nr: 07973 787 233\n\nHis address is:\n\nidea Space\n\nThe Entrepreneurship Centre\n\n3 Charles Babbage Road\n\nCambridge CB 3 OGT\n\nBiographical Details:\nJoe Parry has worked on visualization and graphics systems for intelligence work for the last thirteen years.\nDuring that time he has done software development, design, systems architecture and more experimental\nresearch projects.

The privacy problem was also analized during the conversation.\n\nHere is an excerpt of a very interesting interview with one of the world\u00b4s most brilliant minds in Defense, Counterterrorism and Security Informatics, Dr. Nasrullah Memon.\n\nDear Dr. Memon, could you please tell us what is EISIC 2011? Please elaborate on its creation, mission, objectives and members.\n\nEISIC is the European chapter of Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI) series of conferences. The conference is dynamic and allows academicians, researchers and practitioners to keep abreast of new tools and methodologies in the area of Intelligence Security and Informatics. It is also a venue that fosters networking opportunities for people working in this scientific area.\n\nAfter my graduation (PhD Defense), Professor Hsinchun Chen, Director, Artificial Lab, University of Arizona, the founder of ISI series of conferences encouraged us to organize the European chapter of ISI. In this context, the first event was organized under the name of EUROISI 2008 at Esbjerg, Denmark. That event was organized more as a workshop than a conference and it was not very well attended.\n\nIn September 2010, while Professor Hsinchun Chen visited University of Southern Denmark, we discussed how to re-organize the European chapter of ISI as an annual event in order to create a consortium involving academic researchers in information technologies, computer science, public policy, criminology, and social and behavior studies as well as local, national, and European law enforcement and intelligence experts, and information technology industry consultants and practitioners to support counterterrorism and national\/international security missions of anticipation, interdiction, prevention, preparedness and response to terrorist acts. In other words the mission and objectives for the organization of EISIC series of conferences that came out from the discussions with Prof. Chen are to provide opportunities to establish a European network in the area of Intelligence and Security Informatics.\n\nThe organization of the conference was a very difficult task and we started working for the success of the event from September 2010 with the collaboration of Hellenic American University, University of Southern Denmark and University of Arizona. We formed a team from the above mentioned academic institutes and Hellenic American University accepted to host EISIC 2011 in Athens, Greece while University of Southern Denmark accepted to host EISIC 2012 in Odense, Denmark. As per program chairs, Daniel Zeng and me invited around 100 researchers from academia and industry to work as program committee members. We received 111 submissions for EISIC 2011 and we accepted 27% of high quality papers as LONG papers based on the peer-review process. The research articles were received from 41 countries from all sub-continents.\n\nAs per feedback from the audience we found it was a very successful event. The keynote speeches as well as the paper presentations were very well attended by the participants and there were a lot of positive comments on the quality of the presentations. There were also a lot of opportunities for networking between the participants and we witnessed several discussions about future collaborations between the participants. I would like to mention at this point that the host organization played a vital role in the success of the conference sponsoring the expenses of keynote speakers and finding alternatives of certain problems we faced because of unforeseen incidents such as strikes, etc.\n\nWhat activities does EISIC plan to carry out in the near future?\n\nWe have a number of long and short term plans in the area of Intelligence and Security Informatics. We have established the Counterterrorism Research Lab at University of Southern Denmark in October 2009. Behind the lab there is a small group of researchers (around 10, one Professor, one Associate Professor and several PhD students) working in the area of ISI. We are publishing our research articles in the area in various conferences and journals and we try to establish connections with various law enforcement bodies and intelligence services providing them with our cutting edge technology and experience. Concerning EISIC, we plan to organize EISIC 2012 at our University at Odense on August 22-24, 2012. We also received a number of informal proposals for the organization of collocated events. As soon as we receive formal proposals, we'll decide accordingly. We have also received informal proposals for the organization of EISIC 2013 and EISIC 2014 in Italy and Sweden respectively. The steering committee will decide as soon as we receive formal proposals for the organization of EISIC and related events in future.\n\nIn regard to the Intel discipline, where do you classify the Intelligence Security Informatics ISI? Is it a separate intelligence discipline in and of itself, or part of other intel disciplines like HUMINT, SIGINT, IMINT, etc.?\n\nISI is a discipline where INTEL disciplines could be benefited. Let us take an example; we are working on a research project (sponsored by the Faculty of Engineering, University of Southern Denmark): Developing an Early Warning System to predict Terrorist Threats. Mostly we use OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), but there is room for counterterrorism experts\/INTEL to work. We do not have yet a formal collaboration with INTEL agencies, but I'm sure INTEL people could be benefited as well from ISI research.\n\nWhat role does higher education play in ISI?\n\nAs this is a new inter-disciplinary area, higher education can play a vital role in encouraging students from Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology, Criminology, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics to adopt research in the area of ISI in order to educate experts to help us in building a SAFE AND SECURE WORLD. It is also a need of the hour to train INTEL people with this emerging area of research.\n\nWhat is the relationship between counter-terrorism and computational criminology?\n\nComputational criminology like Countering terrorism is an emerging blend of criminology, anthropology, social computing, computer science and applied mathematics. Modern concerns about public safety and security include a focus on a range of events from less serious everyday crimes like shoplifting to personal violent crimes like homicide and ultimately terrorism. Underlying all of these events is a decision process or a chain of steps in target identification, steps that focus first on rough and vague decisions and move towards the precise plot. The fields of counterterrorism and computational criminology involves the use of computational power to identify: (1) crime patterns and emerging patterns; (2) crime generators and attractors; (3) terrorism, organized crime and gang social and spatial networks as well as co-offending networks; and, (4) cybercrime\/cyber terrorism. Algorithms are developed using computational topology, hyper-graphs, Social Network Analysis (SNA), Knowledge Discovery and Data-mining (KDD), agent based simulations, dynamic information systems analysis and more for detecting organized crime and predicting terrorist threats.\n\nThe methods and models used for counter terrorism and computational criminology can provide information about pattern theory and identification. In short, we treat terrorism as an organized crime, and therefore, it would be possible to use some of the traditional methods to detect terrorism evidences, but also new models can be developed looking into the new type of terrorism of 21st century.\n\n\u00b7 ICT as an instrument, where ICT can be used as primary tool to commit the offence (Identity theft, Internet scams and Fraud-misappropriation of funds are some of the examples)\n\n\u00b7 ICT as target, where ICT is the target of the offence (Hacking, Misuse of ICT resources, Denial of service, Stealing information)\n\n\u00b7 ICT as Ancillary Resource, where conventional crime can be assisted by ICT; in other words technology can be used to commit conventional crime or technology can be used to store information about crime (Fraud, Money laundering, etc., are known examples)\n\nAs the cybercrime has border-less and transnational reach, therefore, there is urgent need to establish competency in predictive cyber analysis and to develop trusted relationships to encourage information sharing among the INTEL agencies. There are number of challenges in cybercrime, for example\n\n\u00b7 Enforcing extraterritorial\/ trans-border law enforcement activity\n\n\u00b7 Many offences are never detected\n\n\u00b7 Many detected offences are never reported\n\n\u00b7 Difficult to quantify the offence\n\n\u00b7 Difficult to \"Police\" the cyber space\n\n\u00b7 Evidence can be intangible\n\n\u00b7 Issuing warrant without knowledge of the precise location of data (evidence) can be problematic\n\n\u00b7 Evidence can be destroyed during search\n\n\u00b7 Encryption and other concealment technologies are available to offenders\n\n\u00b7 Human rights and privacy issue, etc.\n\nHow canthe rightto individual privacybe balanced against the need for protection fromcybercrime?\n\nIt is a very difficult question; I think security is more important than privacy of individual person in some cases. But according to the laws of each country, the privacy problem should be dealt in treating with cyber criminals. the highlights of his academic dissertation BT defined the meaning of saying that data mining \"is the process of posing queries and extracting patterns different from data using techniques\". About its use, she said the technology can be used in national security as well aganist cybercrime and security, like f.e. like to Prevent buildings, destroying critical infrastructure (power, telecom). Dr Thuraisingham said that also can Data Mining find out who the bad guys are, capable of carrying out those Terrorist Activities.\nDefining Cyber \u200b\u200bSecurity BT said it is a technology to Protect the computer and network systems due to Against Corruption last generation of malware like Trojan horses, worms and viruses, including the ultradangerous malware called RAMAL (Radioactive Adaptive Malware), as well as intrusion detection and auditing.\n\nDuring the first part of the presentation, BT described her research (together with Prof Latifur Khan and students of the University of Texas) and said that some techniques like the Link Analysis technology can be used to trace the viruses to the perpetrators. Another technology called Classification can prevent future attacks depending on the data mining learned about the terrorists through emails and phone conversations. The technology can also separate between real threats and non threats at all, by reducing false positives and false negatives.\n\nMore into details of her speech, BT said that the researched techniques like the CFB Program can extract the code blocker malware from data, and make a control flow analysis. She also compared her System with another already in the market , the code blocker SigFree, and assured her system is better, performs better. Her System can detect Malware that is evolving continuosly, even every milisecond, like the RAMAL (Radioactive Adaptive Malware). Currently, all last generation malware evolve continuosly and it is difficult to prevent for regular firewalls. Dr. Bhavani Thuraisimgham defined her anti RAMAL malware tech as the NCD Novel Class Detection, and the tool is the system based on NCD, the so called SNOD or SNODMAL).\n\nCurrently, the most advanced Malware goes undetected because a continuos change in behaviours , every milisecond, and the regular anti malware software can not keep up that speed.\n\nBT assured that her SNOD hast the ability to detect new classes of malware and its changes. She used the SNODMAL, malware detector using SNOD.\n\nShe classified the Malware in two categories: Benign and Novel.\n\nThe usefullness of SNODMAL will extend to detect multiple novel malware classes and quarantine them.\n\nSummarizing, BT also revealed that they are working to find the best way to detect where this malware attack comes from, and to be able to attribute the attack, where it come from with 100% certainty (to avoid false accusations). Several countries have been attacjed by these novel malware.\n\nIn regard to the privacy matter, BT affirmed that the extract of results of the data mining should be private, this is a legal matter, not only an ethical one.\n\nOnce her speech finalized and the round of questions ended, Dr. Bhavani Thuraisimgham met Victor Bjoergan , CEO of the U.S. based Global Security Services LLC, also Publisher of TheAmericasPost.com and EuropeSecurityNews (this under construction). Both discussed the importance of developing these technologies, and its role anti Cybercrime and the strengthening of global security against terrorism."}

Either way, rest assured that terrorists who get through security won't be able to get fat on cupcakes.\n\nOr... maybe they can. A bakery in Rhode Island, picking up on this ridiculousness and sensing a marketing opportunity, is now offering a TSA-complaint cupcake, complete with exactly 3 oz. of frosting... a plastic baggie, and a faux boarding pass declaring compliance:\n\nfrom the questions,-question dept\n\nThere have been an awful lot of stories of computer hacks and breaches lately, many of them high profile: Google, Citibank, Sony, the US Senate. It certainly feels like everyone's under attack. But is that really true? Bruce Schneier suggests that it's just a media sensation:\n\n\"I truly don't think there's a higher instance of hacking right now. I think there's been a wave of media coverage,\" said Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer of BT and one of the most respected security experts around. \"We saw the same thing with shark attacks. It's not that there are more shark attacks. It's that they made the news when people started looking for them.\"\n\nIt does make me wonder. The media can be quite efficient at finding evidence of an epidemic when things are actually occurring at a normal rate, but it certainly does sound like some of the attacks lately are landing on bigger name targets. Part of this may also be the more public attacks from groups like Anonymous and Lulz Security, who are doing what they do more for publicity reasons than as criminal enterprises. Either way, I'm curious to see what others think about the issue. Are we really seeing more attacks and breaches today, or is the press just picking up on it lately?\n\nfrom the the-cynical-view dept\n\nOkay, this post is going to take the extreme cynical view, which I don't believe is true, but since it's being suggested, we might as well flesh it out. In my post about how the US government's response to Wikileaks has caused more harm than anything actually in the leaks so far, one of the commenters pointed to a Larry Lessig talk from a few years back, where he mentioned a conversation with Richard Clarke -- the former anti-terrorism government official, who, more recently, has been selling his book on \"Cyberwar\" -- where he said that the US government has had an \"iPatriot Act\" sitting in a drawer, ready to go at a moment's notice whenever there was \"an i-9\/11 event.\"\n\nExcept there's been no such event.\n\nYet, in the last year or so, we keep hearing about folks trying to sell the public on the idea that we're facing a \"cyberwar,\" which is always stated without any proof. In fact, it seems that the only thing that the whole \"cyberwar\" concept has been good for is to (a) make money for government contractors and (b) to give the government a reason to take away more online privacy.\n\nAs we've seen, there have been rumors over the past few months that the feds have been working on new legislation that would require backdoors in all internet communications -- which sounds sort of like a version of that iPatriot Act. But, of course, in order to get people to actually accept that kind of thing, the government would need to convince people that it's really for their own safety... But that's a lot tougher without any evidence of a real cyberwar. So... along comes Wikileaks (and, to a lesser extent, Operation Payback), and voila, suddenly the press is bubbling on and on about how thisis a cyberwar.\n\nNow, when this new wiretapping law is put forth, the government can claim that it's designed to stop things like having classified cables leaked to enemies of the US -- even though it would have absolutely no impact on such things. Of course, if Wikileaks is a \"cyberwar\" then what the hell were the Pentagon Papers? A wood pulp war? Whistleblowing and leaking documents, online or off, is not a \"war.\" While I don't doubt some in the US government will try to use this to their advantage, I still really doubt that this is the main reason for the current reaction. I'd chalk it up to pure incompetence first.\n\nfrom the good-for-them dept\n\nA few months back, we pointed out how ridiculous it was that a child advocacy group had put out a scary press release claiming that child predators could use Google Street View to prey on children. They could also, you know, walk up and down the street. It's nice to see that the mainstream press is at least calling the group, Stop Internet Predators, out on how ridiculous this is. Nationally syndicated columnist Larry Magid sarcastically slams the group for such pointless fearmongering, not only pointing out that it's easier for predators to just walk up and down the street, but also making the following point:\n\nInstead of banning Google Street View, maybe we should put up walls between streets and sidewalks so that predators can't see children walking home from school. And while we're at it, let's ban public outdoor parks and recreation areas or at least find ways to hide the children playing there. Or just keep children away from churches, schools and other places where pedophiles have been known to operate.\n\nConsidering how often we end up seeing the mainstream press simply parrot these sorts of press releases, it's good to see them hitting back against these more questionable attempts at creating moral panics."}

{"text":"Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students examine how the 'love bug' computer virus caused $6.7 billion in damages after its spread from Asia on May 3, 2000. Students then create profiles of hackers and design public service announcements and posters to discourage the creation of disabling computer applications and to encourage consumer knowledge about such viruses.\n\nSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes- 1 hour\n\nObjectives: Students will: 1. Explore the damage that the 'love bug' virus had in the public and private sectors; create a profile of a computer hacker. 2. Examine how computer viruses are created and the international investigation to apprehend the hackers who created the malignant virus by reading and discussing \"Officials Seek Student in 'Love Bug' Case.\" 3. Design a campaign to encourage computer hackers to employ their skills to improve society. 4. Create a poster or public service announcement that illustrates their bid to discourage students from becoming computer hackers or to inform others on preventing the spread of computer viruses.\n\nActivities \/ Procedures: 1. WARM-UP\/DO-NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following (written on the board prior to class): \"A research company in California estimated Tuesday that the so-called 'love bug' virus and copycats caused $6.7 billion in damages since the e-mail attachment was spread from Asia on May 3. The computer virus forced many businesses and government agencies from the Pentagon to the Ford Motor Co. to shut down their computer networks for protection and repair. What type of person do you imagine would want to reek so much social and economic havoc? What do you think his or her objectives might be?\" Students share their answers.\n\n2. As a class, read and discuss \"Officials Seek Student in 'Love Bug' Case,\" focusing on the following questions: a. Who do the international authorities investigating the case believe is responsible for creating the 'love bug' virus? Where did the alleged mastermind live? Where did he go to school? b. Under what circumstances do the authorities believe the virus was created? How did the Federal Bureau of Investigation become involved in the case? c. Name the second person to whom the police would like to talk. Why do police want to talk to him? What do police believe his role might have been in creating the virus? d. Cite the national and international investigatory agencies that are trying to apprehend the hackers. Why would their investigators be talking to officials at AMA Computer College in Manila? Why weren't the officials at AMA College surprised that FBI agents wanted to speak to two of their students about the 'love bug' virus? e. How does a thesis written at AMA College provide investigators with clues to who created the virus? What action did the college take once it learned about this particular thesis? f. What is the function of this computer virus? What is it supposed to steal? What is it supposed to retrieve? What underground campus group did both of the students who police want to speak to belong? What did this underground group of students write and sell? g. What is the House of Representatives now doing to stem further hacking? h. According to Keith Rhodes, technical director for the chief scientist at the General Accounting Office, why are government agencies vulnerable to computer viruses? i. How many federal agencies were hit by this virus, and of the ones noted in the featured article, how might the viruses have affected those agencies?\n\n3. As a class, create a list of companies and public agencies affected by the computer virus. Then, divide students into small groups, and have students generate lists of at least five ways in which the virus caused economic and social damage to some of these companies and agencies. After five to eight minutes, ask groups to share their responses, and write suggestions on the board. Then, discuss ways in which students might create public service campaigns to either stop potential student hackers from creating computer viruses or to inform others about how computer users can protect themselves. With the remaining classtime, groups should discuss ideas for their public service announcements, which can take the form of print ads, posters, radio announcements, or television commercials. All campaigns should connect to the 'love bug' case. Students should keep in mind their audience and use persuasive techniques to persuade them.\n\n4. WRAP-UP\/HOMEWORK: Each group creates their computer virus related public service announcement. In a future class, students should present their campaigns and constructively critique the work of other groups. Students might also submit their work to agencies or outlets that are committed to stopping computer hackers and informing computer users on how to avoid viruses, such as their local representatives or their Chamber of Commerce.\n\nFurther Questions for Discussion: \u2013What is a hacker? Are all hackers \"bad\"? What good might hackers be able to provide to the computer industry? \u2013How do local, state and international police agencies share information to help stop hackers? \u2013Why is it difficult to anticipate the amount of chaos a computer virus might reek? \u2013What should college officials do to students who write and then sell theses for money to graduate students? \u2013Might the designer(s) of the 'love bug' virus reap any economic or social benefit from creating this virus? \u2013What might schools do to safeguard against students and employees using computers to create malicious applications? \u2013Authorities are saying that it is too early to state the full affect of the virus. What do you think the full effect might be? \u2013Do you believe the hackers, if apprehended, should be tried in more than one country? If so, which countries, and which country should try them first? Why?\n\nEvaluation \/ Assessment: Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries, participation in class and small group discussions, and thoughtful public service announcements.\n\nExtension Activities: 1. Imagine the response hackers might have to your public service announcements and posters. Create a skit that demonstrates their response and displays their thought processes.\n\n2. Imagine your class has participated as members of the jury on the trial of the hackers thought to have created the 'love bug' virus. Compose the sentence you would like to see the sentencing judge hand down on the hackers, and explain to the court why you believe that this sentence is appropriate.\n\n3. Compose the introduction to The Hackers' Guide to Preventing Hacking. Imagine that the authors are veteran hackers who decided to join the fight against computer hacking. The introduction should advise the reader what each of the chapters in your ten chapter book will address. An option would be to make an audiobook of your introduction.\n\n4. Create mock interviews with computer hackers, and write a news story and a feature about the people who create viruses.\n\n5. Interview a professor at one of the leading universities in technology to discover how anti-virus software detects viruses and protects personal computers.\n\nInterdisciplinary Connections: American History- Trace the role that American universities have played in the development of computer technology. How have they and do they continue to work on new advancements? Present your findings to the class, incorporating several Web sites in your presentation.\n\nCivics\/Math- Tabulate the voting records of your government officials on funding for computers in schools and legislation to stop computer hacking. (The technology subcommittee of the House Science Committee in the House of Representatives is holding hearings on how the government can protect computers from mass-mailed computer viruses.) Poll your school community to see what it thinks of these voting records and to learn if there is an interest in working with a grassroots organization to have legislation passed to help stem the proliferation of computer viruses. Create a chart that illustrates what students would like to do and the steps they plan to take to accomplish their actions.\n\nEconomics- Graph the demand and cost for anti-virus software over the last five years. Reflect upon your findings in the form of a report as if it were to be submitted to an economic journal or magazine.\n\nFine Arts- Design the packaging for the ultimate new anti-virus software. What does it promise to do?\n\nTeaching with The Times- Follow the latest developments of the 'love bug' virus and create a daily \"headline timeline\" to which students can add in class. Follow the case as it unfolds and is finally brought to some resolution. Create a timeline on the wall of your classroom that illustrates the twists and turns this story takes. Each student who adds to the timeline must summarize the latest developments. Students may also focus on other viruses or attempts to stop viruses that capture their attention.\n\nOther Information on the Web: F-Secure Computer Virus Information Pages: LoveLetter ( provides a detailed description of the virus and what it does to infected computers.\n\nNetwork Associates Virus Information Library ( has detailed information on where viruses come from, how they infect your system, and how to remove them.\n\nHacker News Network ( includes news, a section on security and security tools, and a cracked pages archive.\n\nSecurity Focus ( is a computer security information clearinghouse which includes a calendar, free tools, forums, industry news, and a library and possible penalties Technology Standard 5- Understands the nature and operation of systems.

While amusing to mass audiences, the storyline begs the question: fact or fiction?\n\nFrom pervasive global outbreaks to smaller, stealthier attacks targeted at specific organizations for extortion purposes, a fundamental shift, or evolution, in cybercrime is anticipated in 2006, according to the IBM Global Business Security Index Report.\n\nHigh-profile arrests in the United States and around the world indicate criminal gangs are increasingly using the Internet as a tool to extort money from businesses.\n\nThe cost of a distributed denial of service attack can be substantial--anywhere from $300 to $13 million per person per incident--and it has been estimated that as many as 10,000 incidents occur worldwide each day.\n\nIn fact, according to the SANS Institute, a computer security training, certification and research organization, the FBI receives more than one report of cyberextortion every day.\n\nFrom ransomware, malicious software that encrypts computer files and asks for a ransom to decrypt them, to the cyberextortionists who demand huge sums of money to cease their attacks, the financial impact can vary.\n\nChief information officers see this crime as a greater threat than physical crime, according to a recent IBM survey of manufacturing, financial, health-care and retail enterprises. Businesses that are victims of such extortion may suffer a loss of customer and shareholder confidence, reduced productivity and a massive dip in revenue.\n\nIntended victims may look to properly drafted insurance, such as a network-risk policy to cover loss arising from extortion threats regarding computer networks and intangible assets. Property policies, as well as kidnap and ransom policies, can also cover business interruption and extra expenses.\n\nNow, if only Hollywood would open its eyes to the appeal of insurance as one of the big-screen heroes, instead of giving Harrison Ford all of the fun."}

{"text":"Kaspersky says Apple needs to change its approach to updates and patches for its machines\n\nComputer security company Kaspersky Labs said that Apple is at least 10 years behind Microsoft when it comes to security.\n\nEugene Kaspersky, co-founder of Kaspersky Lab, discussed the security of both PCs and Macs at the Info Security 2012 event. He concluded that Apple's security is far behind Microsoft's, and that Apple will need to change its ways when it comes to updates and patches.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Macs are becoming increasingly targeted by malware due to increased Mac sales. In Q2 2012, Apple sold 4 million Macs, which was a 7 percent boost from Q2 2011. Cyber criminals are starting to notice that these computers are becoming more popular and are easy targets for malware attacks.\n\nEarlier this month, Apple finally admitted that its machines have been prone to malware problems. It has had issues with Flashback trojan, also known as Flashfake. This particular trojan disguises itself as an install Java applet on hijacked sites, and when users approve it, the trojan runs a piece of code that exploits a flaw in Java to remove OS X's anti-malware abilities. It also installs alternative control programs, turning the machines into bots.\n\n\"Apple is now entering the same world as Microsoft has been in for more than 10 years: updates, security patches and so on,\" said Kaspersky. \"We now expect to see more and more because cyber criminals learn from success and this was the first successful one.\n\n\"They will understand very soon that they have the same problems Microsoft had ten or 12 years ago. They will have to make changes in terms of the cycle of updates and so on and will be forced to invest more into their security audits for the software. That's what Microsoft did in the past after so many incidents like Blaster and the more complicated worms that infected millions of computers in a short time. They had to do a lot of work to check the code to find mistakes and vulnerabilities. Now it's time for Apple [to do that].\"\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Flashback infected about 600,000 machines worldwide (approximately 3,000 in the U.S.) at its peak where 98 percent of these machines were Macs.\n\n\"I think they are ten years behind Microsoft in terms of security,\" said Kasperskya) boot up another O\/S to check the usual hooks\/entry points. b) upload suspicious stuff to virustotal for scanning (copy it to a thumbdrive and use another computer to do the uploading if you think the virus is that devious).\n\nThat is such a stupid comment!! I suppose if you're not sick now you don't need healthcare insurance either. Or how about your car isn't in an accident now so you don't need auto insurance either. Don't use condoms either if you don't have an STD. Man, you're dumb!\n\nWholeheartedly agree. For this reason it is highly irresponsible for Apple to promote their OS as impenetrable. People stupid enough to believe it are even more likely to behave in a less security conscious manner.\n\nquote: ...it is highly irresponsible for Apple to promote their OS as impenetrable\n\nI'm no attorney but couldn't this be considered a false claim by Apple such that it could be vulnerable to a class action? Enough people lose enough money doing online banking, etc, with using their unprotected Macs and serious life changing financial losses could precipitate angry litigants.\n\nI think you are exaggerating the claims that Apple has made. I don't think they've ever come out and said \"you don't have to worry about viruses on OS X.\" They've merely spoke in half truths about there being more viruses on Windows and Windows being less secure because of that fact. It's BS marketing speak but not lawsuit worthy.\n\nActually, Apple's advertisement was, \"Mac doesn't get PC viruses \". Apple has never said anything about Mac not getting any viruses, just that they don't get any PC viruses.\n\nAlthough that is borderline false advertisement, technically they haven't advertised anything that's not true (other than it being magical). That's why I think Apple marketing team have some of the smartest, most devious people on Earth.\n\nWhile technically it is a PC, their advertising ads over the years have been an attempt to tell users that they are in fact not. Hence the \"I'm a PC, and I'm a Mac,\" implying that there is a difference. If your same ads attempt to advertise that you don't get PC viruses, I don't see any problem because they've clearly stated at the beginning that they are not the same.\n\nIf Apple claims that a Mac doesn't get PC viruses... but marketshare analysts like Canalys lump the iPad into the PC world to say Apple has a huge presence in the PC Market, then can you infer that an iPad should get PC viruses? lol\n\nEven that is untrue, macro viruses don't care about little things like operating system or processor architecture. As long as you have a program that can run the macro (like MS Office), it will gladly bring chaos, strife, and ruin. It is also possible to create viruses that execute outside the OS, sorta like a hypervisor, so if said Mac user loads his copy of Boot Camp, gets infected, his OS X stuff gets infected too. It might be possible with such a virus to throw in a second version of the code for multiplying via OS X and Linux and you got a multi-platform virus.\n\nquote: Honestly if you get any virus, on any OS, it is most likely your own fault...\n\nTrue but that's no excuse for relying on anonymity for security. MS doesn't sit on their laurels and tell people they're at fault for being infected. The UAC, malicious software removal tool and hell they even made their own anti-virus program Security Essentials.\n\nApple doesn't rely solely on anonymity for security . Depending on your security preferences you can be asked to type your password before software is allowed to be installed. This is something that I've suggested to MS at every level of beta since Windows Vista. They aren't nearly as vigilant as MS but they haven't had to be. There flat out just aren't nearly as many viruses written for OS X.\n\nlol that's been a standard practice in Linux OS's from as far back as I can remember. I would hardly call that advancing desktop security on Apple's part.\n\nquote: This is something that I've suggested to MS at every level of beta since Windows Vista.\n\nNo offense but I'm glad they have ignored your suggestion. Why on Earth would you want to remember, and type, a password frequently when you can just click a UAC prompt to achieve the same goal?\n\nThe UAC is even better because the Unix\/Linux password method ONLY functions when YOU take an action. There is no active safeguard against something attempting to gain root access behind your back. UAC on the other hand will notify you when any attempt to gain root\/system access takes place. Also a little known fact, but when the UAC prompt pops up and the screen dims, Windows enters a \"secure desktop\" mode where NO program can run until you make your choice.\n\nAlso your suggestion is a bit redundant because you actually CAN make the UAC also function with password. However a good suggestion would be to make this process a bit easier and intuitive to the end user, I agree.\n\nquote: lol that's been a standard practice in Linux OS's from as far back as I can remember. I would hardly call that advancing desktop security on Apple's part.\n\nI didn't say they were advancing security just that they don't completely ignore it.\n\nquote: No offense but I'm glad they have ignored your suggestion. Why on Earth would you want to remember, and type, a password frequently when you can just click a UAC prompt to achieve the same goal?\n\nNone taken. It would obviously be an option, not a requirement. I think requiring a password in the \"UAC state\" is more secure. Imagine a scenario where I leave my laptop unattended for some unknown reason. Guy comes over, pops in his flash drive, and installs a malicious program. Password prompt inside UAC stops that from happening. I think this style of attack is called the \"evil maid\" attack.\n\nquote: Also your suggestion is a bit redundant because you actually CAN make the UAC also function with password. However a good suggestion would be to make this process a bit easier and intuitive to the end user, I agree.\n\nWasn't even aware of that. That should be much easier to enable or disable. Why isn't it right next to the UAC slider??\n\nquote: That should be much easier to enable or disable. Why isn't it right next to the UAC slider??\n\nAg\n\nAlso from a customer support view, I'm sure not requiring a password cut out some millions of calls from people who can't install something because they \"forgot\" their password lol.\n\nquote: I think requiring a password in the \"UAC state\" is more secure.

I do web apps (CRM\/ERP) and I cannot tell you how many times I get emails about forgotten passwords. How?!? Perhaps that is why Microsoft hid it.\n\nquote: NowI can't say how widespread that style of attack is but I can say that I've neither worked nor consulted for a company that enabled the UAC password. I didn't even know it existed.\n\nquote: That should be much easier to enable or disable. Why isn't it right next to the UAC slider?\n\nWhy should they put some redundant slider when this functionality already works 100%? Just use your PC under user account, not under admin account, and evil maid will always fail. Why? 'Cause if you're under user account Windows always asks for password whenever UAC prompt comes up. See, MS is actually much smarter than you think.\n\nAllot of the people that buy Macs buy them because of the form factor (Mac Air) or the exclusive persona they think that it gives them. They also think that viruses are something that only Windows PCs get, so they will click on any prompt and download, because Macs don't get viruses do they?\n\nThe problem with that approach (and MS is guilty of this too) is that the assumption is that you are only installing software if it is attempting to put it in a common area of the system, like the Applications folder on Mac, or the Program Files folder on Windows. Both systems are still perfectly happy to run unsigned, unverified code in user-owned folders, like the desktop or your Documents folder. I know that even code signing doesn't prevent malware (the bad guys could get a certificate too), but the idea that requiring a password (or even a UAC prompt) to install software will prevent malware from being installed is just plain false.\n\nGoogle Chrome is a great example of an application that runs out of user-owned folders. At least on Windows, anyway, it installs for each user and doesn't attempt to put anything into the Program Files folder. So it technically never requires a UAC prompt. I haven't investigated how it does it on the Mac, but the same thing applies... it could run out of a folder that is owned by the current user and no permission would ever be required to install it that way.\n\nBoth Windows and OS X are vulnerable here. Neither one has come up with a magic solution to prevent this.\n\nBut that doesn't matter because without Administrator elevation, nothing can effect your system anyway no matter what folder it's trying to run out of.\n\nquote: but the idea that requiring a password (or even a UAC prompt) to install software will prevent malware from being installed is just plain false.\n\nThis is correct. However in reality it doesn't matter, again. It can install, sure. But unless you're using the Administrator as a USER account (extremely bad practice), the software will still require UAC confirmation to ACCESS and alter system files etc etc.\n\nthat isn't true. I work in enterprise IT. I have seen a number of valid sites, with non-adult content, that had been compromised by hackers. In fact they don't even need to hack the site itself, but rather the ad servers. Most sites these days allow \"foriegn\" content to run in the paid ad areas of their site. Most ads are \"active\" in tht they have some kind of scripting or programmatic content which has executeablity. If hackers can simply modify the ad's code base they can make it download malicious code. There was a well known sports website last year that had some infected ads. Myspace was also notorious for this.\n\nIn all seriousness, Macs do not get viruses. Nor does Linux. Nor does any commercial UNIX. They never have and they never will.\n\nWindows is the only OS plagued by viruses.\n\nNote that I'm using the word virus. A virus is self propagating, and does not require user intervention or social engineering.\n\nApple's recent malware has all been Trojans. A Trojan relies solely on social engineering to spread and infect. It convinces the user that it is something legitimate, and fools them into installing it.\n\nA Trojan is a very different thing than a Virus.\n\nIf I make a Windows batch file that contains \"format c:\" and I email it to you, and say hey, run this awesome new game! And you run it and it formats your c drive. That's a trojan. It is not a technical deficiency in your OS. It's a simple scam. I've tricked you. It's social engineering.\n\nSo yes, a Mac is susceptible to social engineering. Just like Windows is. The big difference however, is that a Mac (and Linux and UNIX) does not, and will not ever get viruses.\n\nIf you make a batch file that containts format c: it will fail. Windows doesn't allow you to format a system disk anymore, and hasn't for over 12 years.\n\nBut since you're using the narrow definition of the word \"Virus\" go ahead and name the last major virus outbreak on Windows computers. I mean, you know *so* much about this subject.\n\nUnless you don't, which is actually the case. Modern outbreaks (using the narrow Virus definition) are almost non-existent now because most infections are hybrids of *multiple* definitions for malicious software, or any kind of software that is designed with malicious intent in mind. A single piece of malware can use any number of techniques including self-replication, social engineering, etc. But since you haven't used anything but Linux or OSX since...ever, I imagine you don't actually know a damn thing about security and are just yanking crap off Wikipedia and pretending.\n\nSurely you are aware that the first virus was on UNIX. There have, in fact, been many computer viruses on UNIX. All operating systems that communicate with other operating systems are vulnerable. No exceptions.\n\nquote: In all seriousness, Macs do not get viruses. Nor does Linux. Nor does any commercial UNIX. They never have and they never will. Windows is the only OS plagued by viruses.\n\nA computer virus is any \"app\" that can spread itself (typically without user consent). As such, your statement above is bunk. It has been a very long time since windows users have seen the kind of viruses that would attach themselves to EXEs and spread through that method. On the other hand, network spreadable viruses are an issue on windows. E-mail spreadable viruses are even worse.\n\nIf you think Mac OS or Linux are free from network\/e-mail spreadable viruses you are either deluded or uninformed. They are just as vulnerable as any OS if an exploit is found (which they have been, many times on Mac and Linux).\n\nYes, trojans tend to be more of an issue because people are easy to trick. And trojans don't require sophistication, although more than \"format c:\" is required. But computer viruses, in the original sense of the word still exist and can affect all platforms.\n\nIf anything, Mac is more safe because of the low numbers of Macs. It is difficult to spread when you can't find the next host to jump to.\n\nApple Zealot: My Apple system got a virus! Apple: Lies! You don't get them! You are holding it wrong! Apple Zealot: Oh! Ok! Thanks Apple, you are the best! <frolics through the rainbow tulips where unicorns are grazing>\n\nWith the rise in hacking related instruments : ATMs, Mobile Phones, iPODs and so on [saw that on this course  on WizIQ] companies like Kasperesky are going to reap big benefits for sure. Its a sure stock to bet on.\n\nIn news broken by Fosspatents and Reuters, Apple CEO Tim Cook and and Samsun CEO Choi Gee-sung have agreed to meet in mid-May to discuss a settlement in the patent infringement case that Apple brought against Samsung and its like of Galaxy smartphones and tablets. \n\nApple is now entering the same world as Microsoft has been in for more than 10 years. We now expect to see more and more because cyber criminals learn from success and this was the first successful one \n\nThe 600,000+ Macs that have been infected by Flashback have had more than an infinite number of times more viruses on them than my Windows PCs ever have. I've never had a single virus on any of my Windows PCs, ever. I keep anti-virus software on them just to be sure, but I've never seen a single infection.\n\nIt's all about keeping software up-to-date and watching what you click on. It really isn't that hard to stay clean"}
{"text":"Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle+\n\nIf your Internet connection has been spotty, slow or altogether malfunctioning, it may be the result of a virus the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been trying to clean up since November 2011. The FBI's latest move in combating the virus may have left hundreds of thousands of Internet users without web access, CNNMoney reported.\n\nAfter arresting six Estonian cybercriminals for infecting about 4 million computers with a malicious software called DNS Changer in November 2011, the FBI created temporary support servers to maintain Internet access for those infected by the virus.\n\nThose temporary servers were shut down today after the FBI spent months collaborating with Internet service providers such as Comcast, Verizon, and Time Warner Cable attempting to identify and notify infected computer owners. Still, the FBI estimates at nearly 250,000 computers worldwide including 42,000 in the United States may still have the virus.\n\nThe virus was spread when the cybercriminals redirected legitimate search engines searches to fake websites with fraudulent advertisements. The criminals were able to collect $14 million through those illegal ads, thereby also infecting users with malware that prevented them from updating anti-virus software.\n\nInternet users who are able to read this story today are probably in the clear, but those who suspect they might be infected can get detailed instructions or a do quick infection check."}

{"text":"Are QR Codes a Real Security Risk For Smartphone Owners?\n\nJust as the use of QR codes slowly creeps toward mainstream adoption in the United States, someone has found a way to exploit them. But how serious is the threat?\n\nSome owners of Android-powered smartphones in Russia were surprised recently when they tried to download an ICQ chat app by scanning a 2D barcode. What they got instead was an unusually large phone bill after their phone sent a series of SMS messages to a premium texting service, which charges a few dollars per text.\n\nThe incident was reported by Kaspersky Lab, an antivirus software firm, who first noted the use of malware to hijack QR codes and install trojans on Android devices last month.\n\nA Real Threat to Smartphone Security?\n\nIt's kind of surprising that this problem didn't arise earlier. Since QR codes can point to and open any URL, it wouldn't be at all difficult to set one up that points to a page that loads some kind of malware and even installs something nefarious on the phone.\n\nAt the same time, the incentive for hackers to do this probably hasn't existed until recently. QR codes are still far from being mainstream technology, but they are being recognized and used by more consumers, as smartphone adoption continues to grow.\n\nThis type of exploit is probably easier to execute on handsets powered by Android, whose \"open\" nature (we know, it's debatable) has the downside of allowing more security holes than its chief competitor, iOS. iPhone users sometimes have trouble opening seemingly common file types, let alone an unauthorized, executable file that could do real damage.\n\nThe rise of this type of security threat is pretty much to be expected as any technology grows in popularity. Look at social networks. Yesterday, as news of the death of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi spread throughout Twitter and Facebook, so too did malware disguised as photos or videos of the ousted leader's final moments.\n\nJust as with social media and email, the first line of defense in smartphone security lies with the user, who needs to be discerning and cautious, whether they're clicking links or snapping photos of a barcode"}
{"text":"Monday could mean lights-out for millions of internet users\n\nThousands of computers in more than 100 countries could lose internet access on Monday as a result of the FBI shutting down servers previously used to host malicious computer software.\n\nThe software, known as DNS Changer, controlled which web pages people saw without their knowledge. This was done by changing the Domain Name System (DNS) settings on a computer to point towards malicious websites. In November last year an FBI investigation into the attacks led to six arrests in Estonia.\n\nThe threat surfaced in 2007 and the FBI says it could have infected more than 500,000 computers in the US alone. The criminals used DNS Changer to manipulate internet advertising, netting them \u00a314m in revenue. In its investigation the FBI found that in some cases system updates and anti-virus software stopped working, exposing infected computers to more threats.\n\nWhen the arrests took place, the FBI took control of the rogue DNS servers and removed the malicious software. The servers were left running in order to give users of infected computers time to remove the DNS Changer by changing DNS settings.\n\nTime is now running out for people to check and change their DNS settings if necessary. The FBI is switching off the servers on Monday 9 July. Anyone who has not changed their DNS settings could lose their internet access"}

{"text":"Long gone are the days when cyber attackers were teenagers in their basements writing viruses and sending them out across the World Wide Web for entertainment and notoriety. Today's cyber attacks are sophisticated, targeted and have insidious motives such as profit\/extortion and terrorism. Attackers are going after organizations that cannot afford to experience any downtime, such as ecommerce sites, banks, telecommunications providers and utilities, and demanding money in exchange for restoring or not disturbing their networks. Additionally, evidence suggests the use of cyber attacks against the U.S. by foreign powers as a form of warfare, i.e., cyber terrorism or cyberwarfare.\n\nCritical infrastructure including power plants and utilities has become an increasing target of cyber attack over the past five years or so. In fact, the CIA has linked at least one widespread power outage affecting multiple cities outside of the United States to cyber attack.\n\nWhile attacks by criminals and terrorists are most alarming, threats can also come from other groups such as disgruntled employees or competitors. Cyber incidents can also occur by accident without the involvement of third parties. For example, last summer, a botched software update on a single computer caused a power plant in Georgia to shut down for two days, strongly revealing the need for airtight security policies and employee training for all utilities.\n\nAt the same time that criminals and terrorists begin to hone in on utilities as targets of sophisticated cyber attacks, utility networks are becoming more open and connected to the Internet to achieve self-healing smart grids. Smart grid can be defined as an intelligent system of automated devices and advanced sensors that create a self-healing network and allow for the incorporation of alternative energy sources into the grid to provide more sustainable energy for the future. A large component of smart grid is the use of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) technology, which allows for the remote control of systems via the Internet. While most systems in the IT world are now more secure and prepared to handle the evolving threat landscape, control systems were not built with these types of sophisticated attacks in mind and therefore do not contain the same safeguards as other systems. Connecting them to open business systems makes them very vulnerable to intrusions. In other words, the smart grid is unfortunately not yet smart enough to resist cyber attacks.\n\nAdditional factors contributing to the severe danger of cyber incidents on utilities include the fact that cyber attacks are often not easily recognized, and can therefore be difficult to identify and remediate, as well as the fact that utilities like water and electricity are vital to our daily lives, and their disruption can cause significant equipment and environmental impacts including death.\n\nIn addition to dealing with evolving threats, utilities are now forced to take a closer look at cyber security due to impending legislation that will make it a requirement. Government agencies such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), self-regulatory organizations like the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), and state public utility and service commissions currently regulate and enforce reliability standards and policies for electricity generation and transmission. All of these organizations are in the process of investigating and developing more advanced cyber security and critical infrastructure protection (CIP) policies, as well as potentially moving into the regulation of electricity distribution.\n\nAll of these factors, combined with the Obama administration's heightened focus on critical infrastructure protection, of which cyber security will play a major role, are creating a perfect storm for utilities operators in terms of cyber security. It is simply a facet of doing business for utilities that can no longer be ignored or downplayed.\n\nKey steps in developing security plans include:\n\nidentifying critical assets and assessing the risk of each asset to attack;\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot of steps, they are all intertwined and required for achieving a more impenetrable network. For instance, without first methodically identifying all critical assets and determining their respective risks, it would be impossible to develop a sound security plan. Additionally, protecting critical assets from cyber intrusions, for example, would be pointless if they were not also physically secured.\n\nA comprehensive, multi-pronged security approach not only provides utilities with robust protection against attacks and other incidents, but also enables organizations to achieve compliance with necessary government and industry mandates. It is expected that such cyber security mandates and requirements will continue to expand in the coming years, making the development of a comprehensive security plan at the present time even more crucial for all utilities.\n\nOverall, the main message to utilities is that the time to develop, revamp or re-evaluate your cyber security plan is now. As both cyber attackers and utility grids become smarter, security is evolving as a crucial piece of the puzzle. Without a comprehensive security plan, the resiliency and self-healing aspects of the smart grid become obsolete, leaving us with a grid that is not only very porous and unintelligent, but also quite dangerous.\n\nReaders Comments\n\nDate\n\nComment\n\nDon Hirschberg 9.30.09\n\nA bit off topic, but there was a brief period when we hanged horse thieves while some killers might go free. As a judge explained, \"I've known men who needed killing but I never knew a horse that need stealing.\" The point of course is that a lone man, no matter how diligent, in most cases cannot prevent his horse from being stolen. Perhaps cyber criminals ought to be treated like horse thieves of yore?\n\nLen Gould 10.1.09\n\nAgreed, Don, much more severe penalties should be implemented for such. However, its likely to be very difficult to track down then extradite such attackers from eg. remote corners of Russia, China, India or Africa etc.\n\nBTW, I was told as a child that the reason horse-thieves were hung was that stealing a man's horse while he was out rounding up cattle alone was effectively killing him (eg. easy to get too far from life support to walk out)."}
{"text":"CLOUD COMPUTING\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cybercrime is booming business. According to Symantec's newest Cybercrime Report, the money involved worldwide with digital attacks is now almost as lucrative as the illegal drug trade - $388 billion last year. In the U.S. alone, the total cost of cybercrime was $139.6 billion last year. Applying the same percentages as calculated in the worldwide survey, that means that 30%, or $42 Billion, was lost due to the actual attack and another 70%, or $98 Billion, was spent on recovery. That's 98,000,000,000 spent in time and money trying to recover from cyberattacks.\n\nThe most common types of cybercrimes are viruses and Trojans that malicious programmers use to steal information or force a user's computer to join a botnet. (A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge, for malicious purposes, e.g., to send spam.) Viruses or malware have at one time affected 56% of online adults. The second most common cybercrime is credit card fraud (18%) followed by phishing schemes (14%).\n\nHere's a frightening thought. While 74 percent of respondents said they were always aware of cybercrime, many do not take the necessary precautions to protect themselves. Forty-one percent of adult Americans indicated they do not have up to date security software to protect their information online. Among those who access the Internet via their mobile phone, only 16 percent install up to date mobile security.\n\nHere's a real life example: a small Dallas area caf\u00e9 got a \"real deal\" on the purchase of a used computer system for the business. Both software and hardware were included. Although it was an older system, the owner was quite happy to have it. However, he never considered computer security because he thought the \"credit card companies and banks take care of all that.\" Now, he has learned that his system his been violated. It could have been someone just sitting in the parking lot with a smart phone. (There's an App for that!) Everything stored on the computer, employee data, vendor data and customer data (and definitely some customer data) has been compromised. This owner had no security system and no firewall. And soon, he may have no business either. The additional cost of a firewall and computer security software is minimal but so many business owners choose to \"save money\" on that only to wind up paying excessive legal fees or computer data restoration fees.\n\nIf you'd like to read more about this serious and costly type of crime and it's prevention, the Better Business in partnership with VISA, Symantec and KROLL has written an excellent article titled \"Data Security Made Simpler.\" This is geared more toward the requirements of all businesses that accept credit cards as payment but can be a real eye-opener for anyone in business.\n\nTOP 10 MISTAKES OF ESTABLISHED RETAILERS (Part 4-Final) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ You may wish to change the order of this list; but all of these are mistakes made by competent store owners and managers. Here is my list of top ten mistakes.\n\n10.\n\nExcuse management\n\n9.\n\nThe Lone Ranger (Trying To Be The Lone Ranger)\n\n8.\n\nNo plan (Not Having A Plan)\n\n7.\n\nNeglecting disaster recovery\n\n6.\n\nThe Way It's Always Been Done (Always Doing Things \"The Way It's Always Been Done\"\n\n5.\n\nUse of social media (Not Using Social Media)\n\n4.\n\nIneffective or no web site\n\n3.\n\nBuying Cheapest (Trying to Always Buy the \"Cheapest\"\n\n2.\n\nPurchasing merchandise based on \"gut\" feel\n\n1.\n\nHiring a criminal\n\nLast month we touched on social media, web sites and buying cheapest. This month we will look at \"buying by gut feel\" and hiring criminals.\n\n2. Purchasing merchandise based on \"gut\" feel.\nSo often we hear of buyers or owners who purchased the most beautiful _______, only to hear later that those lovely items are not selling. The buyer is stumped. Why? This may happen from time to time, but if it happens with any regularity, it is a sign of buying without regard to the customers. Remember the original goal: sell goods at a profit. The idea is to have merchandise that you have no emotional investment in but your customers can and do. Buy to please your customers and remember your customers' mind set is ever changing. If you notice that the sale of dresses is declining, look at what is increasing. If dress sales decrease and separates increase, buy more separates and fewer dresses. It's just common sense. This means you must be tracking your sales by classification (customer demand center or what the customer says they are shopping for when they come into your store).\n\nNo one knows your customers better than you do, so buy according to their likes and wants, not yours . . . even if you pass on a great buy at market. When you order merchandise for the next season, be sure to save some money for in-season buys of those hot commodities. That means you mustuse your Open-to-Buy. Make purchases according to plan.\n\nPlan your sales first, then produce and study your Open-to-Buy, then place orders. Be willing to adjust orders as the year progresses. Select vendors who accept tweaks in your orders to increase purchase orders for hot selling items and decrease or eliminate orders for items that are not moving. Be prepared to find new vendors. Have a plan and follow it.\n\nRemember, sales fueled by high markdowns are destroying your profit. A good Open-to-Buy will account for planned markdowns and will also allow you to easily adjust for in-season sales changes. You have to accomplish 2 things: one is to know your customer, their likes and dislikes and two is to follow your plan. Just as you should not do any grocery shopping when you are hungry or without a list, do not attempt to shop for your store without a plan and stop using your emotions as a guide.\n\nSometimes, you just make a mistake. It happens. Do not compound your error by storing this merchandise until the next season. Storage costs may seem trivial, but are much higher than you think. We have seen several studies that have shown that excess inventory costs 30-35% of its cost. That is expensive. Also, inventory takes up space at your store or requires a special facility, it never looks as fresh the second time you bring it to the sales floor, it loses its ability to generate excitement, and your regular customers always know it's a \"repeat performance.\" This cheapens the entire store in the eyes of the most important people-your customers. Get rid of mistakes as quickly and efficiently as possible. Use your peer groups to discuss the best ways to dispose of these mistakes if you still need ideas. Then do NOT repeat the mistake! Most often, these purchases are made in addition to planned inventory purchases based purely on the emotions of the buyer. Have an Open-to-Buy, understand it and use it.\n\n1. Hiring a criminal.\nWhile no one intentionally hires someone who will steal from them, employee dishonesty has the potential to be the most costly loss category facing a company. Police tell us that given the proper motivation, 90% of people will steal. Some will take cash or merchandise, while others take time and services. Still others will take your piece of mind or your good reputation.\n\nEmployee dishonesty is one of the most under-reported crimes against businesses. Why? Owners and managers are so devastated, disappointed, and embarrassed to be victims of this crime, that often they will simply terminate the offender and \"sweep the incident under the rug.\" However, no other single act or policy will do more to perpetuate a climate conducive to employee dishonesty than sweeping it under the rug. Let all employees know that if they are caught stealing, they will be prosecuted - - and then DO IT!\n\nCriminal background checks are legally required for some jobs; but for most jobs, it is seen as only an extra cost of hiring a new employee. However, it may save a lot of time and money later. Negligent employment cases make criminal backgrounds seem more important. According to K.C. Bettencourt, an undercover investigator, one in three employees steal and it's rising 5% a year. Bettencourt's studies also showed that 20-25% of the work force will cheat when the stakes are high and supervision is low either by stealing merchandise, cash, supplies or time. Furthermore, about 10% will cheat no matter what. Are you still positive you don't have any thieves or potential thieves working for you? The Wall Street Journal reported that up to 75% of all employees have stolen at least once. On the average, 43% of retail workers admitted they have stolen from their employer.\n\nSome authorities recommend integrity testing and criminal background checks. They explain that the benefit outweighs the cost. As that is a personal choice, here are a few facts:\n\n* Most resumes (33%) contain flattering overstatements of accomplishments or employment positions held.\n* The replacement cost of a bad hire is up to 3 times the salary of the job in question.\n* Employers lost 60% of negligent hiring\/supervision jury trials.\n* Police recommend that criminal history checks be repeated every 3 - 5 years in case an employee's circumstances have substantially changed.\n\nDo not ignore the facts in front of you. If your shrink is higher than average, you have a problem. If your cash is consistently short or over, you have a problem. If an employee is secretive about what they are doing at work, you have a problem. Here's an interesting statistic to close with: 44% of employees say their employers could do more to reduce employee theft and their employer chooses not to. You don't have to do something major to check up. Just occasionally do it for yourself. Close the store for the evening help a few times a year. Occasionally open for the manager who normally opens. Check out the discrepancies in the paperwork. You are the owner. It is your store and your future.\n\nSUMMARY\nThis is the end of our four-part series of the top ten mistakes of established retailers.

{"text":"Related stories\n\nA UK hacker has lost his battle against extradition in the High Court this morning. Accused of carrying out the \"biggest military computer hack of all time\", 41-year-old Gary McKinnon looks certain to be sent to the US for trial.\n\nLast July, Home Secretary John Reid approved a US request for McKinnon's extradition. But McKinnon argued that he deserves to be tried on British soil as any crimes he committed were perpetrated in the UK.\n\nMcKinnon's solicitor, Edmund Lawson QC, said his client would most likely have to spend an unknown amount of time in pre-trial imprisonment with little chance of bail or serving any part of the subsequent sentence in the UK.\n\nThe hacker is accused of hacking into 97 computers belonging to The Pentagon, NASA , the US Army , US Navy, Department of Defense and the US Air Force during 2001 and 2002.\n\nMcKinnon has never denied that he hacked into the networks, instead maintaining his intentions were not malicious and that he was motivated more by curiosity than anything else.\n\nThe Glasgow-born man previously said he was able to access the US military networks simply by implementing a 'Perl script' which scanned for computers with default passwords. He was interviewed by our sister magazine .net - you can watch the interview online .\n\nMcKinnon could face a jail term of anywhere between 45 and 70 years.\n\nImproper threats\n\nTo prevent the extradition, McKinnon's legal team tried to highlight flaws in the US case. They wanted McKinnon's case to be referred back to Home Secretary John Reid, or even to the European Court of Human Rights. However, the odds never looked good - usually the Court of Appeal will only make a verdict for or against the subject of the case; referral is rare.\n\nDuring the case, the court heard McKinnon's legal team allege he had been subjected to \"improper threats\". The accusation surfaced because of threats allegedly made after a plea bargain was offered by the US prosecution.\n\nMcKinnon's lawyers have now said he was offered a plea bargain in 2003 by US prosecutors - a reduced sentence in return for co-operation. The US prosecutors had allegedly threatened the defendant that if he did not agree to the bargain, he would be \"turned over to New Jersey authorities to see him fry\".\n\nSome commentators have seen this statement as a 'death threat', although New Jersey has not executed anyone in 20 years. European laws dictate McKinnon should not be extradited if there is any risk of execution. However, the deal was still a sentence \"of three years or less\", and McKinnon would have to serve the sentence in the US rather than the UK as he had hoped"}
{"text":"A series of takedowns by law enforcement around the world may be taking its toll on the hacking group LulzSec. DailyTech claims that a number of recent police raids have seen the heart of the organization torn out. The first major arrest was LulzSec's chief 'Topiary' in the Shetland Islands, who is currently in jail awaiting trial. Recently five UK residents were detained, including supposed LulzSec leader 'Kayla'.\n\nAccording to reports two LulzSec members \u2013 'Sabu' and one unnamed other believed to be called 'Avunit' \u2013 remain free. Other members including 'Tflow', 'Recursion' and 'Pwnsauce' have had run ins with law enforcement.\n\nThe group's Twitter account has been silent for the last two months, which is a good indication that members are either already in trouble or laying low until things cool down.\n\nWhile this probably isn't the end of the group, chances are their entire operation remains non-functional at the moment. Whether it remains that way we do not know.\n\nComments\n\nIt was no big secret that LulzSec quit while they were ahead because they were the sort of retards that decided to start pissing off major government agencies after an enormous security breach at Sony that led to a federal investigation.\n\nIn short, they dun goofed. They didn't think they'd piss off so many important people so when they noticed the results of randomly shutting down servers and hacking into places they shouldn't they suddenly start putting out the message that they only planned to terrorize the internet for a short while. \"No, seriously! We only planned on being hackers for a little while! We did good! Bye everyone!\"\n\nYou're half-right. They did goof up and screw with the wrong people, but they certainly weren't ahead. A little digging turns up a whole bunch of reports of how they were being worked over by REAL hackers. They finally realized they were in over their heads and thought they could duck out before they got into trouble.\n\nThere are some who would tell you they're merely innocent victims of circumstance and they did nothing wrong, but meh. Either way, they'll get what's coming to them, one way or another.\n\nFunny, with all the news of arrested LulzSec members, the count of members claimed by the group is dwarfed by the number of arrest... Me thinks this smells funny.\n\nAnd since most people have simply no idea what is an Informatics crime, what are the rights in this regards, jurisprudence, etc., you're going to have piss poor juries and uneducated lawyers when not simply badly educated judges determining the lives of what has a high chance of including innocents.\n\nOf course! Because the whole world is out to get hackers! Arrest anyone who's ever been on a keyboard because we all know they can't afford their own lawyers! How could I have not seen this before! Truly, the dawn of the abacus is upon us once again! The end is nigh! Repent! Repent!\n\nTo be fair, a 'jury of your peers' is supposed to be one of our basic rights in the US, but historically hacking trials have suffered from judges, juries, and prosecutors that lack the basic background knowledge to understand what it is they are actually discussing except by analogy... and traditionally hackers have not been able to afford the defense team that would be nesseary to overcome this.\n\nThrow into the mix hackers typical poor social skills... (social skills are critical during a trial, juries are notorious for deciding based off gut feelings rather then facts, and neurotypeical\/personable people from unmarginzlied, unstigmatized groups tend to do much better in the courtroom.\n\nMore to the point, blaming people as being \"hackers\" seem to be the new scapegoat. A lot of lesser political adversaries have been caught recently in, was it Turkey? At least, a country near there where there's turmoil. They said they'd caught 20\/30 something members while the whole thing was still fresh. As in the UK, they said they had captured one member, then later said they had captured him again (the previous time, it was just a \"hacker\"). It seems an easy way to make people fall. But don't bother arguing with Griff. If a witch hunt is started on this subject, he'll be at the forefront of the mob, quite happy to say anyone caught deserves it, no matter what they did.\n\nFinally, last thoughts. Why is being a member of LulzSec in itself being guilty? If some members of criminal biker gangs can themselves be innocent of any crime, as well as mafia and so on, why is a membership to LulzSec a sign of guilt in and of itself? I freaking despise neo-nazi and neo-nazi mentality, but we don't arrest people simply because they have it. They have to at least plan a crime (or commit one) to get arrested. So why assume all the members are guilty of all the charges?\n\nWell technically they are innocent until proven guilty so it would be more accurate to say that being a member of lulzsec itself makes you suspected of being guilty. I mean they say they caught the members but that does not mean they had been tried and sentenced.\n\nI'm no expert on law, but i think being a member of a biker gang or mafia that often commits crime CAN get you arrested as you will easily be suspected of having taken part in their actions... Being a member of such a group can easily make you an accomplice, accessory or a conspirator in the crimes committed by the other members even if you did not commit the crimes yourself. Merely having the knowledge that a crime is going to be committed can make you an accessory to the crime; or for that matter having any knowledge of the other criminals themselves can cause problems for you. Frankly, if you know the group is regularly engaged in illegal activity you really should not remain part of that group"}
{"text":"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of (1986)\n\nlaw information system damage\n\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 is the primary federal legislation aimed at curtailing computer crime. It especially applies to interstate crimes that fall under federal jurisdiction. The act was designed to strengthen, expand, and clarify the intentionally narrow Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984. It safeguards sensitive data harbored by government agencies and related organizations, covering nuclear systems, financial institutions, and medical records.\n\nThe act forbids interference with any federal-interest computer system or any system that spans across state lines. Obviously, the act assumed greater importance as the Internet, World Wide Web, and e-commerce grew in prominence. The law prohibits the unauthorized access of any computer system and the obtainment of classified government information. More specifically, it specifies three categories of unclassified information: information belonging to a financial institution, credit card issuer, or consumer reporting agency; information from a department or agency of the United States; and information from any computer deemed \"protected,\" or used exclusively by a financial institution, the U.S. government, or used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication. In addition, the act aims to safeguard computer system integrity with specific prohibitions against computer vandalism. This includes the transmission of a virus or similar code intended to cause damage to a computer or system; unauthorized access that causes damage recklessly; or unauthorized access of a computer from which damage results, but where malicious intent may not be present.\n\nFor purposes of prosecution, the law focuses its attention on the actual damage done to computer systems and the specific economic losses stemming from an act of computer fraud or abuse. For instance, while possession of a code for a computer virus cannot be prosecuted under the law, the loading of such a virus onto a network would be criminal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Violators are prosecuted for knowingly or recklessly damaging such systems, and can be punished with prison sentences as long as 20 years and fines reaching as high as $250,000. Prosecutors under the law, however, often face the difficult challenge of proving that the defendant knowingly inflicted the damage, thereby establishing intent"}
{"text":"Cybercrime is big, troubling business\n\nI was surfing through some security news this weekend and ran into an interesting article on SecurityFocus. The article references a report that states that the reported damages from cybercrime and fraud rose by more then 20% from 2006 to 2007.\n\nOne interesting piece of information turned up by the report is that while identity theft is the most commonly cited example of cybercrime, other criminal activities like auction fraud are causing greater monetary damage.\n\nThis is alarming to me both as a consumer and as a developer of security software. As a consumer if I want to buy something on eBay is it safe to do so? If a seller has a very good reputation does that make him more likely to be the target of a hacker who wants to hijack his account in order to create fraudulent auctions? I'm not sure how often, if ever, this happens but it is still a troubling thought.\n\nAlternately, as a developer what can be done to protect the consumer in this case? Of course protecting the integrity of both the buyer's and seller's accounts is critical. If the accounts aren't compromised then reputation systems will eventually weed out the bad apples and keep the incidence of fraud fairly low. Could you detect a fraudulent auction though? Are they setup similar to cookie-cutter spam messages? Do they contain lots of spelling errors? I'm sure eBay does a lot of work in trying to weed out auctions that are suspect.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the actual monetary damages report, what damage is done when we live and work in a world where we aren't sure we can trust the party on the other end of our transactions? Alan Greenspan has stated that \"the vast majority of trades must rest on mutual trust and only indirectly on the law.\" If Cybercrime continues to expand and become more entrenched in the fabric of the internet shopping experience and consumers become more skeptical about doing business online what effect does that have on the global economy as a whole?\n\nIf you purchase from reputable vendors shopping on the internet is a very safe and simple thing to do, but the increase of reported cybercrime damages is a troubling trend not only in the number of dollars that are stolen but also in the effect it has on consumer trust and confidence in internet commerce.\n\nWe just watched ABC Evening news (5\/1\/08, 6:30pm EDT) and they did a story on ID Theft. They pointed out that much of the cyber theif groups are based in Eastern Europe and attack merchants to steal credit card info.\n\nThis concerns me as an on-line shopper. Does the Norton 360 I use offer any protection for this or are we at the mercy of the merchants being responsible to protect our info?\n\nThanks for commenting. Norton 360 and Norton Internet security have several pieces of technology that might interest you. There is built in phishing protection in the latest versions of the product that will protect you if you are somehow tricked into going to a malicious webpage masquerading as a legitimate one.\n\nThis being said, it is still important to make sure that you're doing business with vendors that you trust because in some regards you are at the mercy of the merchant. However, this is no different than shopping at a traditional brick and mortar store. In fact, My wife's credit card was actually one of the cards identified as potentially compromised in the recent data theft as the Hannaford's chain of grocery stores.\n\nSo if you protect yourself against phishing, and try to make your online purchases through vendors that you trust, then you are as safe shopping online as you are shopping at the grocery store or mall.\n\nHowever, if you want to add an additional level of protection against data theft there is an option. Some banks and credit card companies are starting to provide services where you can obtain a unique credit card number that is usable only once and is linked to your account. This would allow you to shop safely anywhere knowing that the number you used would not be valid if an attacker were to get a hold of it. You may find this link interesting: \n\nI have had my IP address hacked, then they signed into my eBay account using my AI Roboform saved sign-in info, and added two fake auctions, one of these auctions was bidded on, and even though I reported into eBay several times before the auction ended, but after the first bid, eBay refuses to admit that this is possible and has charged me $243.00 for auction fees that they will not refund. Why does eBay take this tact when it is obvious that they were fraudulent auctions?\n\nIs there anything I can do to protect myself in the future? I am using Norton 360."}

The report pointed out that 'bot' or 'robot software' is being highly preferred in cyber attacks.\n\nClick on NEXT to see the top 10 countries in terms of malicious activity...\n\nHacking, cyber attacks: Top 10 countries\n\nBrazil became more prominent in all of the specific category measurements in 2009 except for spam zombies, where it was already the top-ranked country.\n\nBrazil's significant increases across all categories are related to the growing Internet infrastructure and broadband usage there.\n\nThe growing level of malicious code activity affecting Brazil has also resulted in the proposal of a new cybercrime bill in the country. The initiative may also be a result of a number high-profile cyber attacks there in recent years.\n\nOne of the attacks resulted in a massive power grid blackout, while another resulted in the exposure of valuable data and a $350,000 ransom request after a government website was compromised. The latter case resulted in over 3,000 employees being unable to access the site for 24 hours.\n\nHacking, cyber attacks: Top 10 countries\n\nIndia saw a surge in malicious activity in 2009, moving from 11th for overall malicious activity in 2008 to fifth in this period. In 2009, India also accounted for 15 percent of all malicious activity in the Asia-Pacific\/Japan (APJ) region, an increase from 10 per cent in 2008.\n\nFor specific categories of measurement in the APJ region, India increased rank in malicious code, spam zombies and phishing hosts from 2008. Its high ranking in spam zombies also contributed to India being the third highest country of spam origin globally.\n\nMalicious activity tends to increase in countries experiencing rapid growth in broadband infrastructure and connectivity, and the level of malicious activity occurring in India has been increasing steadily over several reporting periods as its broadband infrastructure and user base grows.\n\nHacking, cyber attacks: Top 10 countries\n\nItaly has seen a drop in malicious activity.

{"text":"Schneier on Security\n\nNovember 26, 2010\n\nPsychopaths and Security ashortreadinglist.\n\nMost of the non-obvious part of the talk came down to: don't create an attractive nuisance for trolls aka don't provide  gaming activities; and, make them invest some resources.\n\nOn the other hand, lower risk psychopaths can be very reliable at counterintelligence and pen testing. The fact that they just don't give a damn is very useful. They have to be carefully monitored and controlled, though, for rather obvious reasons. Its also advantageous to ensure the psychopath has a personality that lowers their risk, esp. regarding destructive behavior.\n\nWell, the fact that MI6 did a study which concluded that you can't profile against propensity to commit acts of terrorism, made it to the popular press - it would be interesting to do a \"compare and contrast\" with this.\n\nWhile I'm no psychologist, I suspect it boils down to \"are psychopaths born, or made, potentially in adulthood\"?\n\nGame theory might suggest that psychopaths are still rational actors and that they will choose that action that benefits them regardless of the cost to them. So, in theory we should be able to model psychopath behavior and associated threat.\n\nSteve and Bruce, this has been a serious discussion among many of my friends, ranging from psychologists to doctors to sociologists. Among topics we discuss is the appeal of certain activities that will attract a disproportionately higher number of sociopaths and psychopaths than the average percentages normally found in society.\n\nIt is estimated that at any given time, at least 8 - 10% of our population are sociopaths. One of my thoughts was that given the physical violence in a sport such as football, you could make the assumption that the game would probably attract a higher proportion of sociopaths and psychopaths. Legalized violence? A godsend!\n\nThat said, the Internet would surely also have a high appeal based on several factors which would certainly include a false sense of \"anonymity,\" the ability to stir up large crowds quickly (manipulation and control), as well as new avenues of access to all kinds of supposedly secure data. A psychopath's delight.\n\nWhich leads me to one of my current pet theories: Is it that far a cry to assume that Julian Assange and his Wikileaks is a clear example of socio\/pyschopathic behavior? He exhibits absolutely no remorse in any of the potential consequences of his actions and his arguments always seem to draw a narcissistic response rather than any serious rationale for doing what he does. Would love to see more discussion and examples on such issues in the security community. I'm sure the FBI and the other alphabets already have some profiling done on such subjects and people.\n\nRobertinSeattle and others seem to want to not talk about a fact well-known among psychologists, but apparently not to the public at large: that despite the media's stereotype, sociopathy is alive and well among positions of power in this country - think megabank executives and politicians. It's hilarious to see Robert finger Assange given the more plainly obvious sociopathy that goes on regularly among just the two groups I just mentioned. (Consider for example the well-documented starvation that happened in many nations in 2008 thanks to agriculture commodities speculation by bankers.) We would do well as a society to figure out a way to keep sociopaths from these positions of power.\n\nWhat sort of vulnerability do you think exists in our social or socio-technical systems that makes them vulnerable to psychopaths in ways that they aren't vulnerable to any other random person who wants to break them?\n\nPeople are exhibiting a lack of precision when they equate a \"psychopath\" and a \"sociopath\".\n\nTechnically, a psychopath is someone suffering from a major mental disorder, generally a psychotic one characterized by gross distortions in reality testing or disorganized thought process.\n\nA sociopath is more vaguely defined, with most agreeing that a required characteristic is a lack of remorse for actions which hurt other people and any willingness to change those actions.\n\nA psychopath may be a sociopath, but most sociopaths are not psychopaths. In fact, psychopaths (those suffering from a major mental disorder) are poor sociopaths because major mental disorders tend to reduce the ability to perform sociopathic actions.\n\nThe distinction is important because the highly successful sociopaths do not display any evidence of major mental illness. They look and act perfectly normal except for the harmful behaviors they indulge in. Those who confuse the two are more easily caught off guard because they expect to observe signs of a mental disorder in a sociopath, which are usually not present.\n\nYou need to realise that as with autism there is a sociopath spectrum that covers 5-15% (depending on your values markers) of the population (by the way the term sociopath is less used in Europe).\n\nImportantly those that suffer autism appear to stit on one tail of the bell curve and those that have sociopath tendencies sit on the other tail of the bell curve.\n\nNow you have both high functioning autistics and high functioning sociopaths both are very much needed by society (that is society as we currently know it would not exist). The sociopaths are very goal orientated with human activities (business leaders) and the autistics tend to be goal focused with non human or technical issues (engineers). Which makes them almost symbiotically dependent on each other to function within the more general society.\n\nThe bulk of the population(80%) tend to be in the middle of the bell curve but are generaly not high functioning and tend to be the \"sheeple\".\n\nWhich suggest that the ability to be high functioning may be an integral part of both the autistic and sociopath spectrums.\n\nThe fact that those with high fuctioning autism can train them selves to be good at business in a mechanistic way well beyond the comprehension of non high function persons gives rise to a philosophical debate as to if there is some mechanism that predicates high function but that has a \"handedness\" component of autism or sociopath.\n\nThose who grace the corridors of academia know of the \"Bursur gone despot\" syndrome. I've jokingly heard it refered to as \"switch to the dark side\". What happens is a not so good academic rises not on their research or teaching skills but develops political and business skills and often ends up turning against the academics in a power grab which usually results in more and more money being diverted away form core academic activities (research & teaching) into other activities.\n\nThus students see rising tuition costs and tutors and researchers see falling funding, and the institution sees rising numbers of \"administrators and their ilk\" in their midst telling them what they must do not only in terms of direction of core activities but in what happens to the proceads of such activities.\n\nIt has got to the point now in some institutions that any original thought by either staff or student automaticaly become the property of the institution, and in some places academics are finding that their research results are being censured for the \"commercial reasons\" of sponsors...\n\nHow can you say that a psychopath is threat? Who made a normal person psycho? What are reasons for a normal person to choose a psychopath? May be a normal person is pretending to be a psycho. He knows more than psychologists, probably, because of his know how of Psychology.\n\nIntriguing. It seems like a sizeable number of people live in constant fear of socio\/psycopaths (or 'mutants' as one of those links puts it). I can't help but suspect that the fear of such people does serious harm, just like terrorism.\n\nAnyway good luck ousting those psychos from BT Mr Schneier :)\n\n@Nick P, I'm pretty sure very few penetration testers feel guilty about helping a company in this manner. I certainly don't.\n\nIt's far from obvious to me that a sociopath, still less a psychopath, would be useful in a sporting team. However vicious they were, their self-centredness and deceit wouldn't be helpful at all. I can think of possible examples but they're all of failure, or at least of mediocrity achieved in the face of talent, rather than success.\n\nI know that psychopaths don't exist because it's impossible for someone to be supremely charming and charismatic, emotionless, manipulative and intelligent, irresponsible, temperamental and violent. Those are incompatible traits. Humans aren't innately good, but we are innately similar; we're not a caste species that gives birth to pure evil subhumans. If people aren't innately good, then criminals don't have to be born bad, just raised badly.\n\nAs for \"psychiatric consensus\", these are the same people who presented Munchausen syndrome and satanic ritual abuse as scientific facts. If they don't understand something, they create a story to explain it. It doesn't have to be true or even make sense - it only has to be popular and comforting. In this case, they've stacked every evil, creepy thing they could think of into a medical diagnosis applied to people who piss you off. (That's what lovefraud.com is about - ex-spouses who are evil in every possible way, regardless of consistency.) I'm just pointing out that psychiatric consensus is worthless as evidence.\n\n@Gweihir: That's exactly the point. You only need to prevent the smart ones from the crimes that do actually pay (or make sure that they don't pay anymore, which is easy in theory but hard in practice since the sociopaths are the ones who will have to decide on this).\nBut in politics the moralists do at least as much damage as the sociopaths - and on top of that *they* are usually completely irrational and unpredictable.\n\nStopping some one from doing politics is not solution of threat. Instead, the solution lies in understanding what make a normal person to choose psychopath. Millions effected as a result of a blunder and this effected their mentle health in some way. How many of those mentle people will be stopped? They are in million and their recovery will atleast take a generation...\n\nThe normal persons will easily choose a high functioning psychopath or sociopath over a \"normal\" individual for many reasons.\n1) They don't know him\/her enough to detect the problem\n2) The psychopath have less problem to tell sweet lies than a \"normal\" individual\n3) The psychopath is more confident, or able to project confidence, than a \"normal\" person. Others will reflexively react trusting the confident more than the not confident.\n\nThe only way to reduce the possibility and incentive for psychopaths to have power is to reduce the amount of power anyone can have. This imply a reduction of the power and the scope of the government. The thieves are attracted by a big vault full of treasures more than many little vault with little treasures.\n\nMoralists can be psychopaths as much as not moralists. They are simply different types of psychopaths. Both will not feel any trouble if people suffer for their actions. They consider them justifiable anyway.\n\nThe first two links were interesting, the third was a little on the woo-side of things, and the last seemed to be run by a nutjob (who couldn't even get his facts right). Come on Bruce, you can do better than that, just because someone quotes you doesn't mean they are otherwise on the ball...\n\n\"The new research, however, examines what they have in abundance -- impulsivity, heightened attraction to rewards and risk taking.\"\n\nPeople matching this characterization should be particularly easy to catch with honey-traps, and traps with bait that has actual value would be hard to resist even if they knew it was a trap (a real reward with nothing but a heightened risk in the way).\n\nI was in the security team of a major IT vendor between 2000 and 2004, where I sat on the company's standards review council. At the same time, I was dealing with someone who was clearly a sociopath (specifically, Antisocial Personality Disorder with co-morbid Narcacistic Personality Disorder). In studying the ~1% to 5% of people who could not seem to comply with company policy, and having discussions with them about it, it was hard not to miss a lot of commonalities between them and the aforementioned sociopath.\n\nIt really isn't hard to figure out why. Sociopaths fundamentally feel that rules don't apply to them (exceptionalism), that everyone else is inferior (superiority), compulsively lie and self-aggrandize (fantasize), externalize responsibility for failure, and indulge in high-risk activities through most of their life. This couldn't be further from a responsible and compliant employee.\n\nThe problem is what to do about it. I don't have an answer there, but note that concern about \"corporate psychopaths\" is rising, primarily due to the damage such individuals cause others around them. It is also notable that some corporate psychopaths can be high-achievers, if their personal goals are aligned with the corporation's. Although that observation is, I personally believe, incomplete as the secondary cost of their success might be huge.\n\nPsychopathy and sociopathy are very similar, but with a small semantic difference. The important thing is that they both share the important commonality of a reduced (or non-existent) ability to empathize with others. In other words, psychopaths don't care if you're hurt (even if they're hurting you). Normal people process others' pain with some level of emotion, whereas psychopaths process this information cognitively. There are other typical characteristics as well (such as impulsiveness) that are relatively common.\n\nSome criminal psychopaths (or sociopaths) are violent, some are seemingly non-violent but nonetheless manipulative and hurtful in the non-physical sense. Behavior might be indicative of psychopathy, but a clinical eval is required to ascertain the disorder with greater certainty (the Hare checklist).\n\nSome aspects, eg, psychosis and depressions, are triggered by infections and stress which implies an involvement of the immunity and stress-hormone systems (cortisol).\n\nThey have been part of humanity as far back in history as can be traced at all. Autism and ASPD spectra can also be seen as an evolutionary strategy where an individual's \"genes\" bet on less or more social life-styles. Note that both (weak) autists and psychopaths are parasitic. They are troublesome because they tend to take more care from others than they give back.\n\nA very interesting suggestion is that these spectrum disorders are collateral damage from an epi-genetic battle of the sexes. In evolutionary sense, mothers can raise more children if each demands less care (autism). Fathers get more successful children if they sire cuckoo young that each demand as much care as they can (psychopathy). Things go pathological when either parent cannot \"imprint\" their child correctly.\n\nSee:\n\nBattle of the sexes may set the brain\nChristopher Badcock1 & Bernard Crespi2\n\nWinter: Please try and cite a reference showing that children on the Autism Spectrum require less care. All the evidence I've seen shows the exact opposite.\n\nAlso please try and cite a reference showing that demanding more care has historically been a good thing for a child. My guess is that a demanding child will in some situations diminish the ability of their parents to provide a reliable supply of food, and that as for most of history (and even a large portion of the world population now) food supplies have been short this would be an evolutionary issue.\n\nIt seems to me that children who are close to the median in most measures have historically been most likely to survive to adulthood. For the greatest number of grandchildren there is an advantage in a high-stakes measure for sons (not daughters as they are limited to ~1 child per year). A genetic combination that results in most sons having fewer children than average but some sons having many more than average can spread.\n\nFinally it is generally regarded that the incidence of both psychopathy and autism is significantly greater among males than females. This would be due to some combination of females being less likely to have such traits or less likely to be diagnosed.\n\nThe fact that children on the Autism Spectrum don't need less care and the fact that there aren't more Autistic women than men seems to kill the Badcock and Crespi theory.\n\nNB I haven't read their paper and won't read it. I've read more than enough strange theories about Autism already. If they want to promote their ideas they can start by publishing them under a CC license.\n\n@Russel Coker\n\"Please try and cite a reference showing that children on the Autism Spectrum require less care. All the evidence I've seen shows the exact opposite.\"\n\nI can only say, read the paper. It contains a long list of references. The linked paper tries to make sense of the high prevalence of such harmful disorders. It is not proposing a cure, nor does it assigns blame.\n\nNote of correction:\n\nI was a little hasty and should have reread the paper.\nI intermixed the paternal\/maternal drive behind autism and paranoia. Autism leads to an extremely \"male\" things-person (paternal imprinting) and paranoia\/schizophrenia leads to an extremely female peoples-person (maternal imprinting).\n\nAlthough the paper directly refers to autism and paranoia, it does not actually names ASPD as a disorder it tries to explain. I thought the pattern fitted perfectly for ASPD, but that was my interpretation, and mine alone.\n\nOne big part of securing systems against sociopaths and psychopaths is, imo, mitigating the information lost due to scaling and traversal of hierarchy levels. Sociopaths are ultimately analogous to defectors in the prisoner's dilemma game, and in an iterated game defectors are weeded out. (Or in more common parlance, they're the people everybody in their community or workplace knows not to trust or to get on the wrong side of.)\n\nSo a winning strategy for the sociopath\/psychopath is to keep moving around so that they can access new pools of suckers, or to move up a hierarchy at least to a level where they're insulated from the consequences of what people know about them. Hierarchies can also (as people have noted) protect sociopaths because the people at the top (who may be more than a little off themselves) value the short-term results produced by the sociopath's behavior over the longterm organizational damage, and believe that they'll never be playing against the sociopath themselves. That's assuming, of course, that the people at the top are actually aware of the behavior in question, rather than just the veneer of charm or the manipulated numbers.\n\nHow to preserve the kind of information that would help secure systems against sociopaths and psychopaths is an open question -- those same channels could of course easily be gamed if the reward were considered worthwhile.\n\n\"Finally it is generally regarded that the incidence of both psychopathy and autism is significantly greater among males than females. This would be due to some combination of females being less likely to have such traits or less likely to be diagnosed.\"\n\nIn the case of autism at least, there is an increasing body of evidence that the latter is true. The full explanation is too long and off-topic to go into here.\n\nTo the degree that persons on sychopathy\/sociopathy spectrum are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system perhaps our \"socio-technical systems\" are already addressing them.\n\nIt seems that psychopaths know right from wrong, they just don't feel bad about doing wrong. They do seem to take precautions to avoid detection. Is non-emotional preparation predictive of success in an criminal conspiracy? Probably a little, but I don't see how that helps us defend against them. I wonder if the ability to lie dispassionately when interviewed about a crime doesn't put them a step ahead of the average perpetrator, but that's an investigative rather than a prevention issue.\n\nPsychopathy\/sociopathy can cut both ways. A degree of remorselessness can be a useful trait in those who protect us from evil. There are portions of \"On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society\" by Dave Grossman, A Back Bay Book, which speak to the issue of the small percentage of soldiers who are not uncomfortable killing, and law enforcement officers who are not uncomfortable applying physical violence in service of the public order.\n\nFor further reading I recommend \"The Psychopathic Mind: Origins, Dynamics, and Treatment\" but J. Reid Meloy, Publisher Jason Aronson Inc. It may be a little dated, but it's accessible to the layreader.\n\n>It is estimated that at any given >time, at least 8 - 10% of our\n>population are sociopaths.\n\nThat sounds far too high to me. I don't believe our society could function at that level as too many \"normal\" people would be spending too much time dealing with the sociopaths trying to manipulate them.\n\nThat statistic I've seen is 1%.\n\nAnd the accompanying idea that the dumbest third are in jail, the smartest third on Wall Street (everyone wave to Bernie Madoff!), and the rest are distributed around society where they make our lives miserable when we're sucked into their sphere of influence.\n\nNot everyone in jail is a sociopath. Not everyone on Wall Street is, either. Abnormally high percentages, sure.\n\nMatt from CT: There is obviously a spectrum of psychopaths. A large and complex society couldn't survive with 1% being like Hannibal Lector, most aren't like that. Most of the psychopaths do minor things, probably most of them have no great inclination towards violent crime.\n\nThe justifications of psychopathy in terms of situations where violence is necessary (armed forces and police work) are interesting. It's this type of thinking that permits all manner of bad things to be done. There is no evidence to show that non-psychopathic people have any collective lack of ability to commit acts of violence when there is good reason. There are some people who couldn't function in police work due to being unable to handle the violence, but there are a lot of nice caring people who are willing to use force to protect others.\n\nWinter: I'm not going to pay to debunk every bit of bad research on ASDs. If the idea has any value then someone will publish something similar in public and I'll read it.\n\nI take serious objection to the conflation of sociopathy and autism. The conflation of those two conditions is absurd, and shows ignorance of both conditions. Just because both are spectrum disorders is utterly irrelevant.\n\n@Russell Coker, \"There are some people who couldn't function in police work due to being unable to handle the violence, but there are a lot of nice caring people who are willing to use force to protect others.\": Except that police have one of the highest suicide rates because police work is a soul-draining gauntlet of constantly dealing with (one part of) the scum of society and those most victimized by that scum. Normal people can't handle that long term no matter how well-intentioned they are and either promote out, become assholes, burn out or commit suicide.\n\n\"There are some people who couldn't function in police work due to being unable to handle the violence, but there are a lot of nice caring people who are willing to use force to protect others.\"\n\nBut they are not naturally inclined to it (sometimes to the point of an inability to act) or will feel bad about it (sometimes to the point of disability) unless they are rigorously trained beforehand and carefully counseled and supported afterwords.\n\nDon't get me wrong, a generalized aversion to violence is a good problem to have to work around. Still, before this was well understood, a fraction of this 1% - those toward the \"good guy\" end of the spectrum - may have been doing more violence with less remorse than the rest.\n\n\"I take serious objection to the conflation of sociopathy and autism. The conflation of those two conditions is absurd, and shows ignorance of both conditions. Just because both are spectrum disorders is utterly irrelevant.\"\n\nTo take your point's in reverse,\n\nThe fact that they are both spectrum disorders is actually relavent for a number of reasons, however I would agree that the fact that two things are similar and have other apparent connectives does not make them the same or of necessity connected except via some fundemental mechanism.\n\nBut things can be related as opposites or as orthagonals. As I noted above they appear to be near opposites when involving high functioning, that is in the choice of focus but not to the exclusion of human emotion or empathy. Thus they appear as opposit outliers on some distrubutions.\n\nI suspect the conflation occurs because of the apparent exclusion of human emotions in both disorders appearing the same to many people.\n\nHowever this is as far as I'm aware an active area of debate, it is argued that those on the autistic spectrum lack the ability to recognise emotion in others thus not \"learn emotions\" (ie have no emotional intelligence). Whilst those on the Psych\/sociopath spectrum may well recognise emotion in others very well but it does not engender any emotional response in them.\n\nAs always with research in to the human brain and it's functioning the issue of \"handedness\" arises. Most researchers exclude left handed people from their study groups or fail to investigate it's potential effects\/consiquences in other studies. This has implications for all studies of the human mind and ignoring it potentialy renders an investigator \"colour blind\" in what they observe.\n\nI was wondering why we had all these hits from the \"Schneier on Security\" website. I will say, that of the 900 articles on the Lovefraud Blog, the Autostereograms one was an odd choice. That was a post by a guest author, and was somewhat metaphorical.\n\nIn reference to some of the discussions above - the mental health profession has not agreed on what to call this disorder - sociopath, psychopath, antisocial personality disorder. In fact, the American Psychiatric Assn has proposed yet another term - \"antisocial\/psychopathic type.\" We haven't figured out what to do with that one.\n\nThe professionals have also failed to agree on diagnostic criteria. There's a standoff between the psychology PhD researchers (who use \"psychopath\") and the psychiatrists - MD clinicians (antisocial personality disorder, or perhaps the new name). All this does is leave the public confused, and makes our job trying to educate the public more difficult.\n\nHow many are there? I use the figure 1% to 4% of the population - Dr. Robert Hare says 1% (psychopaths), the psychiatrists say 4% (antisocial personality disorder).\n\nAn interesting note - Dr. Hare, who claims that 1% of general population are psychopaths, also says that 3% of corporate executives are psychopaths.\n\nI invite all of you to visit more of Lovefraud.com - our discussion of this disorder is quite thorough."}

After installing an intrusion prevention system, the security team at UW Medicine spotted several machines trying to communicate with an IRC botnet server in France. Cindy Jenkins, a security engineer and computer forensics expert at the medical and research organization, immediately went on a hunt for clues behind the suspicious activity.\n\nHours spent combing through images of the hard drives from the infected PCs turned up the attackers' tools: an IRC bot, a rootkit and an FTP server. Passive network scanning detected more compromised systems. To save time, Jenkins made hash sets--digital fingerprints--of the malware so she could look just for the hash sets when inspecting additional images. She determined the machines were infected 18 to 24 months earlier--before the IPS and other security measures were installed.\n\nIt appeared that UW Medicine, part of the University of Washington, had been attacked by resource hogs--intruders who don't target data but exploit the speed and ample storage of university networks in order to share movies and music. But then she discovered something that didn't match the original hash sets. The attackers had done more than steal resources; they had accessed the password file for UW Medicine's Windows domain.\n\nRequires Free Membership to View\n\nthe phone tree,\" Jenkins says, recalling her startling discovery in December 2005.\n\nAlthough there was no evidence the intruders had used the passwords, time stamps indicated they had accessed them.

{"text":"OK, this is the general forum and I feel like starting some discussion, so here it goes.....\n\nWhat did the hackers think when they hacked into the playstation network last year, I know for a fact that most hackers love games, so why did they do that..... did they just want to stop playing games for a couple of months or are they stupid???? I know for a fact that most hackers are strategic thinkers, so where did they go wrong, or were the guys that hacked psn just kids and could psn be hacked by simple scripts?\n\nOK, just curious to know what you guys think about this, without getting Robert too angry for starting an offtopic discussion, just because I am bored waiting for the european release of Dead Island.\n\nMy 2 cents... It could be because they come from a country with poor laws and they know that they can get away with it, or it was orchestrated by competitors.\n\nIt could be some other attack from china, that's true, but your other point made me think about microsoft hiring hackers to hack sony's network...... that almost sounds like selling your soul to the devil, but maybe with enough money, even microsoft can hire some hackers\n\nRe the PSN Hack: I take a less 'it was corporate espionage' view and more 'it was due to boredom and angry at Sony's past bad choices (the rootkit boondoggle amongst others.)\n\nAlso as Rob said some countries have rather lax laws (I would go on a tear over how American Media are trying to hove it's interests down the world's collective throats to prop a broken copyright system... but I'm neither articulate enough nor a neutral enough party.)\n\nBut I can see where you're going to here and yes, the us wants to stuff alot of things down our throats including a democratic system where you can only vote for two people, political party's or thoughts.... yeah I know there are independent party's but they get muted by media and all kinds of campaigns by the 2 big ones.\n\nOfcourse china isn't the country behind this attack, would have been nice if it was, some kind of conspiracy theory. Same goes with microsoft, because they were next on the hackers task list. That the hackers operated from a country that has laws that give hackers the opportunity to hack, makes sense, I think that's one of the weakest points in laws across countries, or sometimes even states, the internet is an international thing and should have international laws, maybe if this happens we can actually do something about our nigerian scammer friends.\n\nI vote for the boredom part, but they probably got real bored after sony shut psn down\n\nAh well in some way it still doesn't make sense and I really think those hackers were kids and couldn't predict the consequences of what they did here.\n\nHas it been prooven that there was a group of hackers or was it just one single guy who did this?\n\nOK, I did it, hacked a computer in the US, setup a bounced connection and am able to play Dead Island......\n\nWell this ofcourse isn't really true, but I did setup a VPN connection in the US and am able to play the game now, only have a bandwith of about 200 kbps so not really capable to go in co-op mode, but still I can play this game while living in europe\n\nIf anybody else has this game or has a steam account just add me to your list, my username there is radioman71\n\nDidn't the attack came after the anonymous attack earlier? I was thinking maybe just a bored person thinking that hacking after the anonymous team attack would be funny and they can run easily by blaming on anonymous.\n\nBut yeah, I hate the down time... I can't play online at the time since I only got PS3 at the time. Now I...now I had xbox360....come to think of it, it was because of that attack and the inability to play online that made me bought the xbox 360...\n\nHmmm, that brings us back to the possibility of microsoft being behind the attack. I would like to have a ps3, but right now I am still happy with my ps2, play most games on pc anyhow, I do hate it however that you can't buy a sony controller overhere for pc, while you can buy an xbox controller, which is way too big for me, in other words I just can't get used to it. Therefore I am still using a 10 year old controller, which alot of modern games don't support anymore, think it has something to do with direct input and x-input or something like that. I have been to a computer shop a couple of times to look for a controller and also to feel how they feel while holding them, but none of the computershops actually sell them except in their online shops. I must say that I am thinking about buying an xbox controller, but I just don't know how this feels, probably the only guy on this forum who has never ever played on the xbox, it has a good thing that it is supported on any game I have. Well in the end there is only one thing I can do, buy the controller and play with it for a while...... Maybe somebody here can help me with the question, does this wireless model work and can you get some solution where you can easilly recharge the batteries, if that is even possible.\n\nI can say that xbox 360 controllers are better for my grip, but it might be different for other people. I've played back and forth between ps3 controller and xbox 360 controller and the xbox 360 are way better.\n\nFor xbox 360 controller, the wireless one, you need a wireless receiver adapter (or something like that) and plug it on your USB drive. If it's the wired one, then you just need to plug and play into your USB.\n\nFor the batteries, they do sell a rechargeable battery pack separately, look something like a big square. You can charge it by plugging it into your USB port. But remember, this does not make your controller a wired controller!\n\nBtw, PS3 controller can be sync with the bluetooth of a Mac and you can use it as it is. The trick is to plug a USB while the bluetooth is searching then unplug it again. Don't know on the PC though.\n\nDon't worry about being off topic, Robert is fine with that, up to a certain degree I guess, but we are not discussing any perfume overhere, still talking about games.\n\nWhat you're saying there is interesting though, first of all the rechargable battery pack, is this an optional component you have to attach to your controller. and will it feel different while holding it? Also you said that it won't be a wired controller, does that mean you can't use the controller if you are charging it?\n\nThe bluetooth part, are you saying here, that the receiver actually is a bluetooth receiver or what"}

{"text":"Up Next\n\nWhen the company Enron declared bankruptcy in December 2001, hundreds of employees were left jobless while some executives seemed to benefit from the company's collapse. The United States Congress decided to investigate after hearing allegations of corporate misconduct. Much of Congress' investigation relied on computer files as evidence. A specialized detective force began to search through hundreds of Enron employee computers using computer forensics.\n\nThe purpose of computer forensics techniques is to search, preserve and analyze information on computer systems to find potential evidence for a trial. Many of the techniques detectives use in crime scene investigations have digital counterparts, but there are also some unique aspects to computer investigations.\n\nFor example, just opening a computer file changes the file -- the computer records the time and date it was accessed on the file itself. If detectives seize a computer and then start opening files, there's no way to tell for sure that they didn't change anything. Lawyers can contest the validity of the evidence when the case goes to court.\n\nSome people say that using digital information as evidence is a bad idea. If it's easy to change computer data, how can it be used as reliable evidence? Many countries allow computer evidence in trials, but that could change if digital evidence proves untrustworthy in future cases.\n\n\u00adComputers are getting more powerful, so the field of computer forensics must constantly evolve. In the early days of computers, it was possible for a single detective to sort through files because storage capacity was so low. Today, with hard drives capable of holding gigabytes and even terabytes of data, that's a daunting task. Detectives must discover new ways to search for evidence without dedicating too many resources to the process.\n\nWhat are the basics of computer forensics?

{"text":"Sega Gets Hacked Too, Customer Data Stolen\n\nIt appears that yet another gaming company has come under online attack resulting in the theft of user data. This time it's Sega and its Sega Pass system. No one has claimed responsibility for this attack yet, but most observers are pointing the finger at LulzSec.\n\nSega has pulled the system offline and has not indicated when it might return. According to the statement sent out by Sony to users, \"... a subset of SEGA Pass members emails addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords were obtained.\" Sega stressed that no passwords were stored in plain text. No payment information was obtained in the hack.\n\nWhile the Internet is pretty convinced it was LulzSec, the group posted on its Twitter feed saying, \"@Sega - contact us. We want to help you destroy the hackers that attacked you. We love the Dreamcast, these people are going down.\" Do you think this rash of data breeches will slow down, of is this the new normal?\n\nPrison rape is illegal. You're defeating the logic of your own stance by advocating illegal actions because of your anger at illegal actions. This is exactly what Anonymous does. So unless you are silent or approving of Anonymous then you are being hypocritical.\n\nThis does seem to be an ongoing trend, and even if these guys get busted, and the other guys, and the other-other guys, it is just a matter of time before something bad happens on the internet again. I'll bet Xbox Live and Netflix are doubling down on their security measures, and if not, I'd bet they're the next to get attacked.\n\nIf they didn't claim responsibility for it then I don't think it was them ... I mean if they claim responsibility for attacking major government agencies then why wouldn't they brag about breaking into SEGAs stuff? I'm with them though, my dreamcast was one BAMF console! ;)\n\nHaha hackers destroying other hackers....... Riiiight. Is lulzsec an actual group or just one guy pretending to have friends? I think a person who messes up any website is a major tool. Anytime I hear of a hacker\/hack\/\"programmer\" talking tough on the internet it makes me want to punch them in the face. Actually that would be a sweet android app. Problem with some twat on a forum? Fire up your smartphone and punch them in the face!They didn't hack Minecraft, EVE or LoL, they DDoSed them. They even had a reason. The reason being they were asked to by their 'fans'. They hacked Bethesda and tried to get details about Skyrim by 'blackmailing' them, however they said they would be gentle becuase they enjoyed Call of Cthulu. Maybe their love for the Dreamcast outshines their love for Call of Cthulu. Maybe, given enough time, they would have hacked SEGA, they were just beaten to it and they want to take down whoever did it anyway. Who knows. They're assholes, but they're not morons.\n\nThe internet is hardly convinced it was LulzSec, as LulzSec have no reason to say it wasn't them. Why the hell would they take responsability for hacks like Sony and Senate.gov but not for SEGA?\n\nCrappy media outlets might think it was LulzSec, purely because 1. They only heard about LulzSec from someone else and actualy have no idea what it is, and 2. They do not check LulzSec's twitter. But other than that, I don't think anyone with a brain capable of producing individual thought is 'pretty convinced' that it was LulzSec."}
{"text":"Swartz case prompts debate over cyber law\n\nThe suicide of Aaron Swartz, the Internet pioneer and free-information activist, touched off accusations that federal prosecutors abused their power by seeking a long sentence and stiff fine against him for hacking into the MIT network. But the case may say as much about problems with federal cyber\u00adcrime law as it does prosecutorial judgment, say those familiar with the law.\n\nThe cybercrime statutes are broad \u2014 critics would say disproportionately so \u2014 subjecting even minor offenders to heavy criminal penalties, say specialists. That fact, coupled with sentencing guidelines that encourage prosecutors to take advantage of the tough sanctions, can give rise to overreaching prosecutions, they say.\n\nComments - Risk management by the CORRUPT!!\n\nPublic servants have a fiduciary responsibility to the tax payer; the aforementioned includes a responsibility to provide HONEST SERVICE. Appointed, or simply hired on, the responsibility when you live off the tax payer is no less than if you were an elected official. What our high level public servants stated during the Dimasi trial as reported in the local papers follows:\n\n\"The judge said DiMasi inherited a responsibility to serve in office honorably and should have been aware that his actions were breaking the law,..\" \"Which person is more dangerous in our country,'' Wolf asked, \"someone who is doing what everyone he knows does, selling crack on a corner, or people who are undermining our democracy by successfully conspiring to sell their public office?''\n\nAfter Judge Wolf spoke Carmen Ortiz spoke:\n\n\"\n\nOverreach in the prosecution of a good citizen with intention to only make the world better while ignoring the undermining of our democracy by lower tier public servants does not meet the standard!!\n\nCarmen Ortiz do your job and go after real criminals; if you would just open your eyes you would see that the most dangerous criminals in our society are very low lying fruit! The citizens of this country want their rights back; they are tired of living in fear and having all that they worked for taken away on the whim of the corrupt. Please initiate the process!! \n\nCarmen Ortiz is a disgrace to the legal profession since she is a rank bully. Nixon's War on Drugs has allowed the entire police and prosecutorial apparatus of the Commonwealth and the federal governments to become corrupt, thugish and overbearing.\n\nApparent miscarriages of justice happen every day in our nation and receive no attention from the media, who are usually far to busy covering the juvenile mis-deeds of so-called celebrities to fulfill their obligations to a feww society. The Swartz case has only occupied the local news fer a week because Swartz was bright and white, and threw his advantages away. Others far less fortunate languish in obscurity.\n\nActually, Swartz's influence was already very broad. You haven't heard of him if you are not part of the world he worked in, but you have probably used (without knowing it) stuff he either designed or built.\n\nWhat I mean to say is, the attention that this has received isn't because he was white, or privileged, or famous, but because of the impact of the work he had already done and the potential he had to do more. I don't disagree that injustice is harsher and far more prevalent out in the world for those who suffer because of prejudice or poverty. I'm just saying that the attention has nothing to do with what Aaron Swartz was, but what he did.\n\nCybercrime is still relatively new and scares the feds so they want to scare potential ctiminals. They just didn't think that the guy would kill himself - they wanted to scare the stuffing out of him and others like him.\n\nThis \"outrage\" is too ridiculous. It seems Swartz didn't learn much from his time at the Harvard Ethics center, or perhaps he did assume the ethical principles that surrounded him.\n\nThe bottom line is that Swartz didn't like that the academic journals charged for their information - essentially that they were businesses at all. So he attacked them at their most vulnerable point, JSTOR.\n\nSo, if the journals can't charge for their product, how are they to survive? Peer review and standards have a cost. Perhaps Swartz preferred academics simply tweet their results. Great idea. Let's all reduce ourselves ot our lowest common demoninator and see how progress looks it a few years.\n\nha. as if the educational establishment is not sucking enough money from students and parents. Peer review and standards have a cost and one would think that with the enormous sums of money, JSTOR would be free. but this debate over JSTOR is a shiny object, a distraction. the point of this article is prosecutorial discretion, overcharging and bullying by an office which has quite the flawed track record, the Boston federal US Attorney ... they have enough blood on their hands for which they have never been held accountable and now this ?? you want to live on your knees? go find some other society where the government is the master.\n\nAcademic journals _don't_ pay for peer review and they don't pay for articles. In fact, authors sometimes you have to pay _them_ to publish, then you have to pay _them_ to get the article. Peer review is done by fellow academics as part of their academic work, without pay. And, if the research was done on a government grant, taxpayers already paid for the data. For-profit academic journals once had a place, they no longer do. JSTOR is not the villain in this case, but Swartz is not a criminal. He did an act of civil disobedience in order to show up the absurdity of the law.\n\ndraconian and dehumanizing?? look no further than this US Attorney. who says she has to be a bully to effectively prosecute crime??\n\nfor any Obama supporters, his Justice Department is nothing but a disappointment, to put it politely. States decriminalize or legalize pot as well as create medical marijuana laws and the reaction of the Justice Department is to double down on the War on Drugs ... and, as with the original Prohibition of the 20s, the only thing they have done is to invigorate criminal networks of thugs, powered by the money made on selling what naturally grows and what people want. now we will have mafias on steroids.\n\noh, and we get warrantless, no-knock searches and the fully appparatus of a Bully-Nanny State. and the Boston US Attorney is the face of that Bully-Nanny ... is it too much to hope that she has no political future and a shortened tenure as a lousy prosecutor? certainly has demonstrated that she has not one shred of humanity. no, the problem is not in the laws but in ourselves as we put up with school yard bullies grown up.\n\nNo one was hurt. No one was threatened. Bad analogy. Here's a better one: You know how libraries put out income tax forms this time of year? Let's say that someone has taken the free tax forms that libraries put out. Then they open a store and sell the tax forms. Then someone takes those tax forms without paying the store.\n\nThe question to be answered is whether or not these kinds of crimes should merit a jail sentence. Maybe years-long probation and fines would have been a better answer. Keepig an eye on him to prevent him from doing this again seems appropriate. What good is jail time?\n\nEven after jail, he would then have to go on probation. So why not just put him on probation from the get-go?"}
{"text":"How phone hacking works (and other lessons from the News Corp. scandal)\n\nAnyone who's paid attention to the news lately has likely been bombarded with round-the-clock-updates on the phone hacking scandal that has ensnared Ruport Murdoch's News Corp empire.\n\nBut if you looked past the melodrama being played out before the entire world, or even beyond the often-discussed concerns over press ethics and journalists' unsavory ties to government officials, the unfolding scandal brings to light, in my opinion, an equally disturbing (if not worse) threat to the public at large: phone hacking.\n\nHow did the reporters do it? And since just about everyone these days has a voicemail enabled cell phone, how vulnerable are we?\n\nBefore we get to these questions, here's a brief rundown in case anyone needs to get up to speed:\n\nThe crisis, which erupted earlier this month, has revealed that employees at the company's British tabloid News of the World illegally accessed and tampered with the voicemail accounts of terrorist victims, deceased British soldiers and Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old girl who was murdered in 2002. There also has been allegations suggesting that the illegal activity was not just an isolated case of a few rogue staffers misbehaving, but an elaborate and covert operation involving senior executives at News Corp., Scotland Yard and even the Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nThe investigation is still ongoing so a more comprehensive picture of what transpired will take shape as more details come to light. But what we do know, at least in a technological sense, is that there are essentially three main tactics the intruders likely used to access private voicemail accounts, according to an in-depth report published by the popular tech blog Gizmodo. And to give you a well-informed idea of how this whole shady business of phone hacking works, here are the quick and dirty blueprints of these methods:\n\nTactic #1\n\n1. The phone company provides an external number customers can use to access their inbox.\n2. The service gives access to the caller dailing in if it recognizes that the customer is calling in from an approved phone number, like their cell phone.\n3. The loophole in this system is that the service makes this determination by reading the incoming caller ID.\n4. Crooks can easily spoof a user's Caller ID using Voice Over IP and some software.\nTactic #2\n\n1. Most of the time, the service offers an additional barrier of protection by requiring that the person calling in enter a four digit password.\n2. The problem is that users are initially given a default password, which they can change once they access the system.\n3. Typically, the default password is the last four digits of the person's phone number.\n4. Customers often don't take the extra step to create a personalized password. Hackers know this and are more than happy to take advantage what can amount to be a serious lapse in judgement.\n\nTactic #3\n\n1. For the sake of convenience, another way users can often access their voice mailbox is by dialing their own number and entering a secure password.\n2. Hackers, too, have a way of mimicking this sequence, but it requires that they first have somebody occupy the user's phone line.\n3. While the line is being held up, a call to that number \u2014 with the correct spoofed caller ID \u2013 goes directly to voice mail .\n4. To get past the security password barrier, hackers would sometimes reset the code by calling the provider's customer service department and successfully impersonating the user.\n\nThe report also highlights one of the major reasons why voicemail in particular has become such an easy target for hackers. It's a scheme that can be pulled off repeatedly without rousing any sort of suspicion; no one knows if a message has been accessed if the hacker remembers to categorize the accessed recordings as new, a feature that's also used with email.\n\nAlthough there isn't a 100 percent foolproof way to protect against such transgressions, most instances of phone hacking can be prevented simply by activating a personal security code that no one else knows. Steven Rambam, an investigator and director of Pallorium, Inc., told Gizmodo that \"90 percent voicemail-specific problems can be prevented if strong passwords are put into place.\"\n\nTo fortify security measures, companies can also require more stringent criteria to verify the identity of customers requesting sensitive information, says SPP Blue security expert Hemanshu Nigam, in an interview with the Washington Post.\n\nIf as a society we learn anything from this, it's that the more barriers put in the place, the more we can deter the bad guys from making us targets of things people consider.\n\nthanks for sharing of things people consider."}
{"text":"Cyberterrorism is the use of Internet based attacks in terrorist activities, including acts of deliberate, large-scale disruption of computer networks, especially of personal computers attached to the Internet, by the means of tools such as computer viruses.\n\nCyberterrorism is a controversial term. Some authors choose a very narrow definition, relating to deployments, by known terrorist organizations, of disruption attacks against information systems for the primary purpose of creating alarm and panic. By this narrow definition, it is difficult to identify any instances of cyberterrorism.\n\nCyberterrorism can be also defined as the intentional use of computer, networks, and public internet to cause destruction and harm for personal objectives.[1] Objectives may be political or ideological since this is a form of terrorism[citation needed].\n\nThere is much concern from government and media sources about potential damages that could be caused by cyberterrorism, and this has prompted official responses from government agencies.\n\nThere is debate over the basic definition of the scope of cyberterrorism. There is variation in qualification by motivation, targets, methods, and centrality of computer use in the act. Depending on context, cyberterrorism may overlap considerably with cybercrime or ordinary terrorism.[2]\n\nIf cyberterrorism is treated similarly to traditional terrorism, then it only includes attacks that threaten property or lives, and can be defined as the leveraging of a target's computers and information, particularly via the Internet, to cause physical, real-world harm or severe disruption of infrastructure.\n\nThere are some who say that cyberterrorism does not exist and is really a matter of hacking or information warfare.[3] They disagree with labelling it terrorism because of the unlikelihood of the creation of fear, significant physical harm, or death in a population using electronic means, considering current attack and protective technologies.\n\nIf a strict definition is assumed, then there have been no or almost no identifiable incidents of cyberterrorism, although there has been much public concern.\n\nCyberterrorism is defined by the Technolytics Institute as \".\" [4] The term was coined by Barry C. Collin.[5]\n\n[T]he use of information technology by terrorist groups and individuals to further their agenda. This can include use of information technology to organize and execute attacks against networks, computer systems and telecommunications infrastructures, or for exchanging information or making threats electronically. Examples are hacking into computer systems, introducing viruses to vulnerable networks, web site defacing, Denial-of-service attacks, or terroristic threats made via electronic communication.[6]\n\nCyberterrorism can also include attacks on Internet business, but when this is done for economic motivations rather than ideological, it is typically regarded as cybercrime.\n\nAs shown above, there are multiple definitions of cyber terrorism and most are overly broad. There is controversy concerning overuse of the term and hyperbole in the media and by security vendors trying to sell \"solutions\".[7]\n\nThe following three levels of cyberterror capability is defined by Monterey group\n\nSimple-Unstructured: The capability to conduct basic hacks against individual systems using tools created by someone else. The organization possesses little target analysis, command and control, or learning capability.\n\nAdvanced-Structured: The capability to conduct more sophisticated attacks against multiple systems or networks and possibly, to modify or create basic hacking tools. The organization possesses an elementary target analysis, command and control, and learning capability.\n\nAs the Internet becomes more pervasive in all areas of human endeavor, individuals or groups can use the anonymity afforded by cyberspace to threaten citizens, specific groups (i.e. with membership based on ethnicity or belief), communities and entire countries, without the inherent threat of capture, injury, or death to the attacker that being physically present would bring. Many groups such as anonymous, use tools such as DDOS to attack and censor groups who oppose them, creating many concerns for freedom and respect for differences of thought. There are some ironic examples of censorship used as a tool to censor censors!\nAs the Internet continues to expand, and computer systems continue to be assigned more responsibility while becoming more and more complex and interdependent, sabotage or terrorism via cyberspace may become a more serious threat and is possibly one of the top 10 events to \"end the human race\".[9]\n\nPublic interest in cyberterrorism began in the late 1980s. As 2000 approached, the fear and uncertainty about the millennium bug heightened an interest in potential cyberterrorist attacks also increased. Although the millennium bug was by no means a terrorist attack or plot against the world or the United States, it did act as a catalyst in sparking the fears of a possibly large-scale devastating cyber-attack. Commentators noted that many of the facts of such incidents seemed to change, often with exaggerated media reports.\n\nThe high profile terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001 and the ensuing War on Terror by the US led to further media coverage of the potential threats of cyberterrorism in the years following. Mainstream media coverage often discusses the possibility of a large attack making use of computer networks to sabotage critical infrastructures with the aim of putting human lives in jeopardy or causing disruption on a national scale either directly or by disruption of the national economy.\n\nAuthors such as Winn Schwartau and John Arquilla are reported to have had considerable financial success selling books which described what were purported to be plausible scenarios of mayhem caused by cyberterrorism. Many critics claim that these books were unrealistic in their assessments of whether the attacks described (such as nuclear meltdowns and chemical plant explosions) were possible. A common thread throughout what critics perceive as cyberterror-hype is that of non-falsifiability; that is, when the predicted disasters fail to occur, it only goes to show how lucky we've been so far, rather than impugning the theory.\n\nThe two following proactive responses are keys in fighting against cyber terrorism. First, it is important for us to equip ourselves with secure products. This means our programmers must build better secure products that are easier to manage. Secondly, the role of computer users is as important as vendors. We, the daily computer users must be aware of how to deploy such products in secure ways. Cyber security is best achieved when these two proactive responses are taken routinely.[10]\n\nThe pace of development of information technology in 21st century has been faster than ever and is far too rapid. As a result, the development exceeded our capacity to secure proper educational institutions to manage it. We lagged behind the speed of development in producing skilled and specialized managers and establishing a proper educational cyber norm among our general public. Thus, in order to successfully prepare ourselves against cyber terrorism, thatching up men of information technology along with equipping ourselves with the aforementioned two proactive responses will be essential. Establishing proper and structured educational institution regarding cyber security is what we need in this era of information technology.[11]\n\nThe Chinese Defense Ministry confirmed the existence of an online defense unit in May 2011. Composed of about thirty elite internet specialists, the so-called \"Cyber Blue Team,\" or \"Blue Army,\" is officially claimed to be engaged in cyber-defense operations, though there are fears the unit has been used to penetrate secure online systems of foreign governments.[12][13]\n\nMay 2011 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the establishment of the National Internet Defense Taskforce, charged with developing tools to secure vital Israeli online infrastructure. \"The main responsibility of the taskforce will be to expand the state's ability to defend vital infrastructure networks against cybernetic terrorist attacks perpetrated by foreign countries and terrorist elements,\" said a statement from the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nAn operation can be done by anyone anywhere in the world, for it can be preformed thousands of miles away from a target. An attack can cause serious damage to a critical infrastructure which may result in casualties.[14] Attacking an infrastructure can be power grids, monetary systems, dams, media, and personal information.[1]\n\nSome attacks are conducted in furtherance of political and social objectives, as the following examples illustrate:\n\nIn 1996, a computer hacker allegedly associated with the White Supremacist movement temporarily disabled a Massachusetts ISP and damaged part of the ISP's record keeping system. The ISP had attempted to stop the hacker from sending out worldwide racist messages under the ISP's name. The hacker signed off with the threat, \"you have yet to see true electronic terrorism. This is a promise.\"\n\nIn 1998, Spanish protestors bombarded the Institute for Global Communications (IGC) with thousands of bogus e-mail messages. E-mail was tied up and undeliverable to the ISP's users, and support lines were tied up with people who couldn't get their mail. The protestors also spammed IGC staff and member accounts, clogged their Web page with bogus credit card orders, and threatened to employ the same tactics against organizations using IGC services. They demanded that IGC stop hosting the Web site for the Euskal Herria Journal, a New York-based publication supporting Basque independence. Protestors said IGC supported terrorism because a section on the Web pages contained materials on the terrorist group ETA, which claimed responsibility for assassinations of Spanish political and security officials, and attacks on military installations. IGC finally relented and pulled the site because of the \"mail bombings.\"\n\nIn 1998, ethnic Tamil guerrillas swamped Sri Lankan embassies with 800 e-mails a day over a two-week period. The messages read \"We are the Internet Black Tigers and we're doing this to disrupt your communications.\" Intelligence authorities characterized it as the first known attack by terrorists against a country's computer systems.\n\nDuring the Kosovo conflict in 1999, NATO computers were blasted with e-mail bombs and hit with denial-of-service attacks by hacktivists protesting the NATO bombings. In addition, businesses, public organizations, and academic institutes received highly politicized virus-laden e-mails from a range of Eastern European countries, according to reports. Web defacements were also common. After the Chinese Embassy was accidentally bombed in Belgrade[citation needed], Chinese hacktivists posted messages such as \"We won't stop attacking until the war stops!\" on U.S. government Web sites.\n\nSince December 1997, the Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT) has been conducting Web sit-ins against various sites in support of the Mexican Zapatistas. At a designated time, thousands of protestors point their browsers to a target site using software that floods the target with rapid and repeated download requests. EDT's software has also been used by animal rights groups against organizations said to abuse animals. Electrohippies, another group of hacktivists, conducted Web sit-ins against the WTO when they met in Seattle in late 1999. These sit-ins all require mass participation to have much effect, and thus are more suited to use by activists than by terrorists.[8]\n\nNon-political acts of sabotage have caused financial and other damage, as in a case where a disgruntled employee, Vitek Boden (aka Peter Markan) caused the release of 800,000 litres of untreated sewage into waterways in Maroochy Shire, Australia.[15][16]\n\nMore recently, in May 2007 Estoniawas subjected to a mass cyber-attack in the wake of the removal of a Russian World War II war memorial from downtown Tallinn. The attack was a distributed denial-of-service attack in which selected sites were bombarded with traffic to force them offline; nearly all Estonian government ministry networks as well as two major Estonian bank networks were knocked offline; in addition, the political party website of Estonia's current Prime Minister Andrus Ansip featured a counterfeit letter of apology from Ansip for removing the memorial statue. Despite speculation that the attack had been coordinated by the Russian government, Estonia's defense minister admitted he had no conclusive evidence linking cyber attacks to Russian authorities. Russia called accusations of its involvement \"unfounded,\" and neither NATO nor European Commission experts were able to find any conclusive proof of official Russian government participation.[17] In January 2008 a man from Estonia was convicted for launching the attacks against the Estonian Reform Party website and fined.[18][19]\n\nIn 1999 hackers attacked NATO computers. The computers flooded them with email and hit them with a denial of service (DoS). The hackers were protesting against the NATO bombings of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Businesses, public organizations and academic institutions were bombarded with highly politicized emails containing viruses from other European countries.[22]\n\nThe Japanesecyberpunkmanga, Ghost in the Shell (as well as its popular movie and TV adaptations) centers around an anti-cyberterrorism and cybercrime unit. In its mid-21st century Japan setting such attacks are made all the more threatening by an even more widespread use of technology including cybernetic enhancements to the human body allowing people themselves to be direct targets of cyberterrorist attacks.\n\nIn the 2009 Japanese animated film Summer Wars, an artificial intelligence cyber-terrorist attempts to take control over the world's missiles in order to \"win\" against the main characters that attempted to keep it from manipulating the world's electronic devices.\n\nIn the 2012 film Skyfall, part of the James Bond franchise, main villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) is an expert cyberterrorist who is responsible for various cyberterrorist incidents in the past.\n\nCyberterrorism plays a role in the 2012 video game Call of Duty: Black Ops II, first when main antagonist Raul Menendez cripples the Chinese economy with a cyberattack and frames the United States for it, starting a new Cold War between the two powers. Later, another cyberattack with a computer worm leads to Menendez seizing control of the entire U.S drone fleet. Finally, one of the game's endings leads to another attack similar to the latter, this time crippling the U.S' electrical and water distribution grids. An alternate ending depicts the cyberattack failing after it is stopped by one of the game's characters pivotal to the storyline.\n\nThe plot of the 2013 video game Watch Dogs is heavily influenced by cyber-terrorism. In which players take control of the game's protagonist, Aiden Pierce, an accused murder suspect, who hacks into a ctOS (Central Operating System), giving him complete control of Chicago's mainframe in order to hunt down his accusers.\n\n^Yu, Eileen (27 May 2011). \"China dispatches online army\".

{"text":"Reader Services\n\nBlog\n\nCyberwar: Is the Sky Falling or Are We Just Paranoid?\n\nSometimes the line between legitimate worry and pathological fear can be very thin. Certainly, in a business like insurance, we want to be sensitive to various threats and risks, but when do we say that we're carrying that sensitivity too far? Most of us would be happy to be characterized as prudently cautious, but no one wants to be called paranoid.\n\nIn a recent Wall Street Journal piece, two U.S. senators\u2014Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine)\u2014are saying that our country should prepare for a cyberwar. The article notes that the U.S. needs to prepare for cyber-attacks that could \"disrupt or disable vital information networks,\" and \"cause catastrophic economic loss and social havoc.\"\n\nIn light of the recent attacks on Google, as well as other such events linked to China, Russia and unaligned hacking syndicates, it certainly seems prudent to recognize such threats and take steps to mitigate them. Yet, I am also hearing some who characterize the threat as overblown, and who point to the fact that previous cyber-attacks have not had such catastrophic consequences. While they may sincerely feel this way, however, I wonder how much of their largesse finds its origins in the economic realm. In other words: \"Let's not tick off China because we can make billions on that market.\"\n\nThe current \"what, me worry?\" crowd reminds me a lot of people who were saying the same sorts of things prior to Sept. 11, 2001. Sure, we had terrorists attempting to blow up the World Trade Center, attacks on American embassies overseas, and the sinister attack on the U.S.S. Cole, but these were not major catastrophes, they claimed. While the families of those killed might care to differ, it's likely that many in this country felt the same way at that time.\n\nMoving back to the cyber-realm, it certainly is reasonable to think that while we haven't had a 911-like cyber-incident yet, there are those who are dedicated to making it happen. The source of the threat may or may not be the same, but surely we have seen enough in the way of attacks to believe that more are coming\u2014and that the next one could be a blockbuster.\n\nSo we are left with a choice. We can bury our respective heads in the sand and pretend that nothing horrible could happen, or we can pull out all stops to prevent what could easily be catastrophic consequences to our businesses, our infrastructure and our people. Call me paranoid if you like, but if it's up to me, I'm going to err on the side of caution and put safety and security before profits and dollar diplomacy.\n\nAfter all, isn't that what we're all about in the insurance industry1)\n\nWhat is too paranoid?\nIf you had told me on September the 10th that a bunch of niutjobs might hijack fully loaded airliners and fly them and full speed into some of our iconic buildings, killing thousands I probably would have laughed at you.\n\nHave you noticed how the new Chinese helicopter resembles the European Merlin to the point of being identical. The blatantly copy cars. motorcyles, sneakers and electronics with impunity\n\nThe Chinese know they can't grow their economy making low value stuff so they figure they can accelerate their economic growth by ripping off IP from western nations.\n\nThe fact is that the US is an information economy and relies on services like Finance, Insurance etc. A major attack could cripple the international financial system. Even a 24 hour interruption in the flow of capital could cause potentially fatal damage to major institutions.\n\nPreventing cyber attack is like any worst case scenario exercise - you have to balance the cost of the improbable\/unexpected with the cost of preventing it users"}
{"text":"I did see that episode and Space Rogue is right and I agree with what he said. He said \"you either are a hacker or you aren't, there's nothing ethical about it. But prefacing the term with ethical you give the illusion that all hackers are bad, or somehow unethical. Hacker does not equal criminal\" Space also think Space Rogue is misinformed, he asked why if the DoD had to pick an official certification, did they \"pick one from the EU\" instead of one of the US based certifications. EC Council does not have any offices in the EU: \n\nHe said \"you either are a hacker or you aren't, there's nothing ethical about it.\n\nIt's very true, that being a hacker IS being a hacker. It's the mindset and reasoning BEHIND behind a hacker that qualifies the actions as ethical or not. I only caught part of the episode, as I got pulled away on a critical issue, for a customer. But I would really like to catch the rest at some point. I've never looked for it, though, but is there an archive I can catch the rest at?\n\nTIASpace'm not to sure about that (just watched the segment again). The show is called HNNCast (as in Hacker News Network), and it's mostly about computer security.\n\nIt is basically about the whole conversation of \"We don't hire hackers\".\n\nWhen it comes down to it, ethics are flexible. Mine and yours won't match up on certain issues. There is legal and illegal, and in different parts of the world, those won't match up. Certifying someone as ethical is like classifying porn vs art; the \"I know it when I see it\" concept has always been bogus.\n\nIt all goes back to trust and risk management. I trust that a pen tester from company X won't destroy my world. There is a risk that he\/she will, but I would have recourse in this situation. Reputation is very important in security, and who you know is as important as what you know.\n\nGreat thread, so I thought I'd chime in as I've been part of this conversation for a while. Especially running a site named The Ethical Hacker Network.\n\nchrisj makes an excellent point. It's more that the phrase 'ethical hacker' is a subset of the larger group 'hacker.' Just like black hat or criminal hacker is also a subset. We're all hackers.\n\nI just recently did a video for CompTIA on the basics ethical hacking. One of the areas I cover is what 'ethical hacking' is and what it is not. 2 things I mentioned in the section on what it is discusses a) there's more than 1 accepted definition of hack as being negative. Mostly in academia. Take a look at this from dictionary.com on the def of the noun 'hack':\n\nQuote\n\n1. a a professional who renounces or surrenders individual independence, integrity, belief, etc., in return for money or other reward in the performance of a task normally thought of as involving a strong personal commitment: a political hack\n\nMembers of the media also have their own definition with a negative connotation:\n\nQuote\n\n4. to damage or injure by crude, harsh, or insensitive treatment; mutilate; mangle: The editor hacked the story to bits.\n\nAnd then B) When identifying themselves, criminals don't mention their subset, they simply call themselves hackers.\n\nSo add the definitions with negatives tones used in academic circles and the media (which BTW come from academia themselves) to the bad guys calling themselves hackers, and it was doomed to be hijacked.\n\nSo legitimate industry came up with a way of describing their subset. They've tried 'auditors,' 'researchers,' 'pen testers'... maybe it's simply because the word 'hacker' is sexy that 'ethical hacking' stuck. No matter what you call yourself, a rose by any other name...\n\nSo ethical is just a way of describing yourself. Apollo makes a great statement about being ethical and only experience and reputation can prove that you actually are. I don't completely agree with his art vs porn argument, but I see his point. A cert can clearly let the world know that you have a baseline of technical knowledge. But can it truly claim that you are ethical? The way I see it is that a certification attemtping to certify ethical behavior can only help the individual claim that their intention is to go down the legal path. As mentioned, experience and reputation is the only true way of proving it.\n\nThen again, can't the same thing be said of the technical side? One may have the book knowledge to be able to pass a cert, but experience and reputation in the practical use of that knowledge is what sets you apart from the rest."}

{"text":"Errata Security\n\nWednesday, May 15, 2013\n\nAfter the sucky Star Trek reboot, I assumed the series would get better. It didn't, the second installment in the series is much worse. If you are a fan of the Star Trek canon, do yourself a favor and don't see this movie. Once seen, it cannot be unseen.\n\nThe best analogy for this film is Transformers 3, a terrible movie consisting of one long action sequence with less plot holding it together than a porno. The critics hated that movie, giving it a score of 36% on Rotten Tomatoes. But, like porno, it's the low-brow entertainment that people want, making Transformers 3 the fifth highest grossing movie of all time (over $1-billion).\n\nSimilarly, this new Star Trek likewise is less a movie and more a spectacle. If you like lots of noise, shiny big things crashing into other big things, and men grunting at each other, then you'll like this movie. But, if you want to think, you'll hate it.\n\nStar Trek 2 takes the low-brow concept even further. The unoriginal plot is just pulled bit by bit from the more famous episodes and movies in the Star Trek canon. It's designed to stroke your ego, making you think you are intelligent because you recognize what's going on. And that's the biggest problem: this new movie not only craps all over the Star Trek series as a whole, but over many of your favorite parts in particular.\n\nSaturday, May 11, 2013\n\nGoGo Inflight is running a promotion right now giving you free Internet access on airplanes from your Blackberry phone\/pad. Even if you don't have a Blackberry device, you can still get the free service by changing your browser identifier to match a Blackberry (instructions below). Here's the question: is spoofing your browser ID like this in order to get free Internet service illegal under laws like the CFAA (\"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\")?\n\nThat's an interesting debate, but there is a further twist: GoGo Inflight's promotion violates their own Terms of Service (ToS). According to the ToS, you need a \"user account\" to use the service. However, the Blackberry promotion doesn't give you one, because it triggers off the browser ID. Thus, even if you have a valid Blackberry (and aren't cheating), you are still technically in violation of the Terms of Service.\n\nWhat I'm trying to show here is that nobody reads the Terms of Service \u2013 not even the people who write them. The marketing droids who negotiated the deal with Blackberry clearly had no idea that the promotion violates their own ToS.\n\nThat's why Internet activists are up in arms about the anti-hacking law known as the CFAA. It's so vague that it's impossible to tell the line between legal or illegal. Even lawyers can't tell if you if cheating on the browser ID is legal\/illegal. Prosecutors often try to use the ToS as a guide, but as this example demonstrates, companies don't even mean what their ToS says.\n\nEven though I paid the $12.99 for GoGo Inflight service (with a user-account), I also flushed the cookies and change the MAC address in order to test getting the free service. (Actually, I just rebooted -- my machine automatically flushes cookies and resets the MAC on reboot). I used a Chrome addon called \"User-Agent Switcher\" to change the browser identifier to:\n\nGoGo Inflight sees the \"(BB10; Z10)\" portion and assumes I'm using a Blackberry Z10 device and offered me the free service instead of paid service. The sequence of screens activating this are shown below:\n\nFrom this point on, I had free Internet access from my MacBook Air. I didn't use it, but switched back to the account that I'd paid for. But, what you are supposed to see in these screenshots is that even with a real Blackberry device, no user account is created. This means all Blackberry users are technically in violation of the ToS.\n\nYou can go read the Terms of Service yourself and find some reading that makes sense, thus refuting this blogpost. I've spent some time at it, and as far as I can tell, GoGo Inflight does not mean what its own ToS says.\n\nTuesday, April 23, 2013\n\nAccording to all press outlets, the stock market \"plunged\" today due to @AP getting hacked and reporting explosions at the White House. In fact, stock prices didn't change much at all. Below I've graphed today's S&P 500 stock price. As you can see, it's a flat line hovering within 1% of 1580:\n\nSo how does the press create a story that it plunged? By changing the baseline. Instead of using '0' as the baseline, they use a baseline of '1560'. This magnifies the change for dramatic purposes. It makes the graph look like the following:\n\nThis looks scary indeed, but it's not true. Yes, the @AP hack had a noticeable effect on stock prices, but not necessarily an important effect.\n\nLet's look at it from another perspective, the ^VIX volatility index. As you can see, today was the least volatile of the past five trading days. In addition, the brief event related to @AP is only barely noticeable, and unremarkable compared to volatility later in the day.\n\nWednesday, April 10, 2013\n\nBitcoin is an increasingly popular electronic currency, used both for legitimate and illegal transactions. Economists haven't taken a serious look at bitcoin yet, so I thought I'd take a stab at it. In particular, I'm going to look at the \"intrinsic value\" of bitcoin, answering the question whether the recent rapid rise in price (to $240 at the time of writing this) is justified.\n\nThe TL;DR version is this: bitcoins have real value (they are not a fantasy), and that value is between $0.01 and $15000.\n\nBitcoin vs. Money\n\nThere have been many un-serious looks at BitCoin. Take, for example, this 2011 blogpost by Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman, where he compares bitcoin to the gold standard. He's completely wrong.\n\nThe mistake economists make is assuming that bitcoin works like real money. It doesn't. While bitcoin is designed as a \"medium of exchange\", it doesn't serve the other traditional functions of money, such as a \"store of value\", \"unit of account\", or \"measure of value\".\n\nIn recent months, the price of bitcoins has skyrocketed. In classic economics, this means that the bitcoin economy has experienced massive \"deflation\". Likewise, when the bitcoin bubble bursts and the price goes down, the bitcoin economy will experience hyper \"inflation\".\n\nBut this inflation\/deflation has no effect. Prices aren't denominated in bitcoins, but in some hard currency like dollars or euros. Buyers exchange their dollars for bitcoins, give the bitcoins to the seller, who then immediately changes them back to euros. The entire process takes about 30 minutes. The only requirement is that the exchange rate for bitcoins not fluctuate wildly during this half-hour window. Since bitcoins are electronic, they can easily be subdivided, so \"billionth of a bitcoin\" is a workable value. When analyzing bitcoin, we have to toss out this idea that it is a \"measure of value\" and the related ideas of inflation\/deflation.\n\nBitcoins are not legal tender. That's entirely the point: it's a rebel currency designed to evade normal government controls. But that means there is no government protection, either. This means that you cannot borrow bitcoins, because the government won't force you to pay back the loan. While might be able to store bitcoins in a \"bank\", rather than paying you interest on your deposit, the \"bank\" would charge you a fee. Thus, there is no bitcoin financial system. Our entire economic system isn't based on money but derivatives of money -- all that goes away leaving bitcoins by themselves.\n\nBitcoins are not a \"store of value\". Sure, speculators are hoarding bitcoins, but that's a different thing. You can't safely store bitcoins on your computer, because they will be lost when your hard drive crashes or a hacker infects you with a virus. You can't rely upon somebody else to store them for you, because as mentioned above, there's no law forcing them to give them back. And, as recent hacks of bitcoin businesses have shown, it's unlikely that an online site is safe enough. Only experts have enough skill to safely store their own bitcoins over long periods of time.\n\nThis is the failing of economists. They've built up a bunch of assumptions and rules-of-thumb about how \"money\" works, but bitcoins aren't really money, and those assumptions break down. We have to go back to first principles.\n\nMeasuring the bitcoin money supply\n\nBitcoins are currently above $200\/coin. Is this price justified? Or is this due to speculators? What's the \"true\" value of bitcoin? To answer this question we have to first find out the \"true value\" of any currency, like the dollar or euro. Why is $1 worth $1? Or, better asked, why is $1 worth a quarter of a Big Mac hamburger? The answer is this: economists don't really know. They have theories, and some evidence, but they aren't certain.\n\nThe basic theory of money is simply \"supply and demand\". People demand money both as a medium of exchange and store of value. People demand money because barter is inefficient. If you want your car fixed, you might try to offer the mechanic some chickens, a goat, or a year of free haircuts. But if your mechanic is a long haired hippie, he's not going to want any of these things in trade. What he wants is something that he can easily exchange elsewhere. In other words, your mechanic demands money.\n\nThe same goes with savings. Long term savings are in things like your house, but in an emergency, it's hard to sell your house. Therefore, people want some savings in something more liquid, which is to say, money.\n\nThat's where the value of $1 comes from: supply and demand. People demand a thing that can easily be exchanged, and that demand creates value. This value is as real as the value of anything.\n\nThat's the theory, and there is evidence to back it up. For example, when governments print more money, the supply goes up, and as you would predict, the value of money goes down. That means it then takes more money in exchange for the same goods. In other words, prices go up, and inflation occurs. That's what happened in pre-war Germany and Zimbabwe more recently: the governments printed more and more money, causing hyperinflation with prices doubling daily.\n\nThere are other theories about where the value of money comes from. Some people believe that the value of currency comes from the government who prints it. The evidence for this theory is not good. Saddam-era Iraq is a good example. The 1991 Guld War cut off Iraq from the outside world. Instead of using high-quality \"Swiss\" printing presses, Iraq printed new money on low-quality presses. They also printed more of it, causing devaluation and inflation. The old currency continued to be used in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, even though it was no longer officially recognized by the government. Moreover, when Saddam's regime fell, both forms of Iraqi currency continued to be used, even though no government existed to set its value. Even bad money is better than bartering three chickens and a goat -- the value comes from the demand, not from the government.\n\nYet another theory about the value of money is that it's due to irrational \"faith\" or \"perception\" of value. Economists disagree. A fundamental axiom of economics is that people are rational. When they value gold, dollars, or bitcoin, the assumption of economists is that people have a rational reason for doing so. Bubbles may seem irrational, but it's from people rationally betting. Some will be winners, some will be losers. It's like betting on who wins the superbowl: just because they lost the bet doesn't mean the losers were irrational choosing that team. All evidence suggests that valuing money is the \"rational\" thing to do, and trying to setup a barter system is less rational.\n\nSo if the \"true\" value of bitcoin is set by supply and demand, what are the \"suppy\" and \"demand\" for bitcoin?\n\nThe entire premise of bitcoin is that it can be used in the underground economy. This includes illegal activity, such as buying drugs, but also a lot of legal-but-shady activity, like buying porn or transferring money to your cousin overseas. The IRS estimates that the unreported underground economy is about $2-trillion per year (out of a total GDP of $14-trillion). So let's use that number as our \"demand\" part of the equation.\n\nWhat is the \"supply\" of bitcoin? That's determined by mathematics of the bitcoin algorithm. There are about 10-million bitcoins now, which will rise to a maximum of 20-million bitcoins over the next decade. So that's 20-million bitcoins chasing $2-trillion in transactions.\n\nCompare this to the official economy, with $2.4 trillion in money (M1) chasing $14-trillion in transactions, or a 6.553 ratio. Simply divide $2-trillion by 6.553 by 20-million and poof, you get the precise value of bitcoin: $15,260 per coin (fifteen thousand dollars).\n\nThat seems like a lot, much more than today's $240 price, but it's based on an enormous number of probably invalid assumptions. Changing the assumptions changes the valuation. For example, if we assume bitcoin is only used for 10% of the underground economy rather than 100%, then the value is 10% that number, or $1,526.\n\nPut another way, with bitcoins approaching $300, that means punters are assuming bitcoins are going to take over 2% of the underground economy. If you think bitcoins will take over more of that, then you should be buying bitcoin. Likewise, if you think bitcoin will take over less, then you should be selling bitcoin.\n\nNote that I use the M1 measure of the money supply in this calculation. Let's talk about money supply for a moment.\n\nThere are three good measures of the money supply: M0, M1, and M2.\n\nM0 is just the amount of physical money, which is about $800-billion in bills (mostly $100 and $20 bills). The 20-million possible bitcoin is the M0 of bitcoin.\n\nM1 includes M0, plus checking accounts. When you deposit money, your bank immediately lends out most of it. The borrower spends that money, which gets deposited in a bank, which likewise lends out most of it. This \"fractional reserve banking\" multiplies the effective amount of money available to about $2.4 trillion.\n\nM2 includes M1 and M0, plus liquid savings like money market funds. This is money that households can easily spend, but which they generally choose not to. This is roughly $10 trillion.\n\nIf you think bitcoins will be used primarily for transactions and not for savings, then M1 is the more appropriate measure. If you think there will be more saving of bitcoins, then M2 is likely a better measure, so increase your estimate of bitcoin value by four times.\n\nSince there is no banking in bitcoins, that makes M0 and M1 equivalent. If you think banking services like \"fractional reserve lending\" are likely to appear, then reduce your estimate of the value of bitcoin by three times.\n\nThe value of protocol\n\nThe above discussion is a top-down analysis from the \"economics\" perspective, comparing bitcoin to money. Let's also do a bottom-up analysis looking at bitcoins as a \"network protocol\", as a means of exchanging money -- but not being money itself. That last bit is important: we call bitcoins money, but technically, it's just a protocol for exchanging dollars into other dollars.\n\nAn essential part of bitcoin is that it takes 10 minutes for a transaction to complete. That number is baked into the protocol. Your transaction gets added to a blockchain, and that chain gets computed and rebroadcast out to the rest of the network. There is a new blockchain every 10 minutes. A typical transaction will therefore take 30 minutes: 10 minutes for the buyer to convert hard currency to bitcoins, 10 minutes to exchange the bitcoins, then 10 more minutes for the seller to change those coins back to hard currency.\n\nLet's assume a $2-trillion economy where bitcoins are converted back to hard currency as fast as possible, where nobody holds onto the coins longer than they have to. Running these numbers ($2-trillion divided by (365*24*60*2) divided by 20 million) comes out to 10 cents per bitcoin. Assuming a smaller economy, such as bitcoins handling 2% of the underground economy, and you get 0.2 cents per bitcoin. Since there's a little slack in the system, let's call this 1 cent.\n\nThis assumption that people get rid of bitcoins as fast as possible won't be true, of course. Take a hypothetical gambling site that deals only in bitcoins. It'll take bets over the season on which baseball team will win the superbowl, and only then paying the winners at the end of the season. The value of 10 minutes is only the minimum, the average will be larger.\n\nYour belief in how long a bitcoin will be held (on average) therefore changes the equation. If the average built coin is held for a day rather than 30 minutes, the value of a bitcoin goes up 50 times. Conersely, the time between block chain confirmations can do down (it's actually 7 minutes now instead of 10), reducing the value of bitcoins. Today's alue of $240\/bitcoin implies the average length of time somebody holds onto a bitcoin is 7 years (assuming bitcoins handle 2% of the underground economy).\n\nThe value of politics\n\nCan the government outlaw bitcoin, driving its value to zero?\n\nThe government has an excellent track record in this respect. They've bankrupted other popular electronic currencies, like \"e-gold\". Americans can no longer obtain Swiss bank accounts, because the Swiss are tired of the U.S. government harassing them all the time. This means there is a serious risk that the government can either shut down bitcoin completely, or drive it underground severely reducing it's usefulness and value.\n\nBut here's the thing about bitcoin: it's based on math, no organization controls it. Even if the government bankrupts public facing sites like Mt. Gox and throws its owners into jail, bitcoin transactions will continue.\n\nIndeed, you could have the reverse effect: the more government shuts down competing currencies, the more valuable bitcoin becomes as the one currency the government cannot shut down. There will always be a huge demand for an underground, non-governmental currency that government will never successfully squash.\n\nConclusion: is this a bubble?\n\nI've laid out arguments why bitcoins are worth as low as 1 cent and as high as 15 thousand dollars ($0.01 to $15000). So, should you be buying or selling right now with the value around $200?\n\nLet's say you bought Amazon.com at the height of the dot-com bubble. How much money would you have lost? At the height of the bubble, their stock price was $100 a share. Now it is near $300. You wouldn't have lost money, you would have instead tripled your investment. Of course, the other 99% of dot-com companies either went out of business or lost most of their value. Amazon is one of only a few companies that have held onto their value.\n\nThe point is this: just because it's a bubble doesn't mean it's a bad time to invest. Given certain assumptions, I've laid out a good argument why bitcoins could be worth thousands of dollars, much higher than the current price of $240. If you agree with those assumptions, you should be buying bitcoins.\n\nThe point is also this: the Internet did take off, exceeding the wildest dreams of even the most optimistic visionary. But this didn't mean that early dot-com investors made any money; most lost their shirts in the dot-com crash. Bitcoin could become wildly successful, accounting for a trillion dollars a year in transactions, all with a valuation of pennies-per-bitcoin. That means you can still lose a lot of money while being \"right\".\n\nFull disclosure: I own 4 bitcoins (that I got from mining), and I have no plans to sell them. Neither do I have plans to buy any.\n\nUpdate: since starting this post and completing it, the bitcoin bubble appears to have burst:\n\nMonday, April 01, 2013\n\nA lot of ink's been spent lately on\nthe idea of cyber warfare, cyber defense, the enemies, the allies, what would\nwe do if we had a cyber Pearl Harbor, etc. As one of the foremost experts on\nall things cyber, I thought I would take a day to explain some of the finer\npoints of this new realm of warfare and how to fit in.\n\nOrganization\n\nNow despite what anyone may say,\nCyber Warriors are going to be a huge part of any future war. In the military\nthere is a name for highly skilled Special Mission Units (SMUs). They are\nreferred to as a \"Tier-One\" units. These units are well known secrets like the\nArmy's 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (Delta Force), the Navy's\nNaval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU or SEAL Team 6), and the Intelligence SupportActivity (ISA). These are the men and women our country calls upon to solve the\n\"big boy\" problems. Cyber Warriors will soon join their ranks, but not as a\nTier-One unit.\n\nEvery true Cyber Warrior worth his\ndeck knows that counting starts at zero. Be prepared to see DoD messages about\nTier-Zero units. These will be the cyber warriors with access to military-grade\nexploits and viruses. They'll be the guys with the authority to infect an\nenemy's computer with e-sheep in the name of freedom.\n\nHow To Join\n\nThe training required for Tier-One\noperators to arrive at the \"tip of the spear\" is a highly classified secret. Expect\nno less for Tier-Zero operators. Various methods of recruitment could be, but are\nnot limited to:\n\n1.Apprehending you when you break into your school to change your grades.\n\n2.Lurking on IRC channels that elite hackers are known to\nfrequent.\n\n3.Breaking into your Call of Duty clan meeting to taunt you. This\nwill test your mental stamina and toughness. They need to see if you have what\nit takes. There's no good time during a mission to cry over getting flamed.\n\n4.Sending out mass flyers advertising \"military style\" boot camps\nfor MCSEs. Do you have the guts to respond?\n\nHowever the recruiting is done, you\ncan be sure it will be subtle. It will in no way resemble a NSA recruiting\nbooth at Defcon.\n\nHow to Dress\n\nSince Tier-Zero and Tier-One units\nwill work together closely, it makes sense to dress as much alike as possible.\nGenerally, if you are a sniper you wanna take out the guy that looks like he is\nin charge. You're looking for the guy who looks somehow \"different.\" Different\nmeans important. Important means \"target.\" This is why saluting unpopular officers\nin the field is called a \"sniper check.\" If the \"different\" looking guy doesn't\nget shot, it's just because there wasn't a sniper around to shoot him. Here is\nhow to blend in with a Tier-One unit while carrying out your Tier-Zero mission.\n\n1.Uniform \u2013 Just\nbecause you are not actually with them does not mean you should not dress like\nthem. Stock up on tactical pants and combat shirts. The preferred brand is a\ncompany called Crye Precision. Their combat pants and shirts will help you\nblend in considerably. The Tier-One guys use all the pockets to carry things\nlike first aid kits, high tech military gear, secondary weapons, etc. A\nCyberwarrior can carry things like USB doodads (microphones and thumb drives),\nextra Ethernet cables, your secureID card, multiple cell phones, a tablet, and\nyour office badge. The combat clothes also have removable knee and elbow pads.\nI suggest you use these when you have to rewire a server room, plug something\nin under your desk, or reach under the vending machine when a Mountain Dew\nslips out of your hands.\n\nAs a word of caution, go for the Khaki, Black or Green. The Multicam will make you blend into your surroundings,\ncausing you to be counted absent at work or a no-show for a boring meeting. You\ndon't want to lose a vacation day because you blend in too well.\n\n2.Footwear \u2013 Tier-One\nassets can expect to go anywhere and do anything. For that reason, they wear\nspecialized shoes and boots from makers like Oakley and Salomon. This footwear\nis designed to withstand jumping out of airplanes, trekking across deserts, and\nslogging through jungles. The ankle support is key. Getting a sprained ankle in\na firefight is just embarrassing.\n\nA Tier-Zero operator needs the same\nsupport. A hallway could be getting mopped. A data center could have a pulled\ntile you don't notice, or someone could spill their Big Gulp at lunch and cause\na slip hazard. Fire drills and offsite meetings are also concerns. Take care of your feet, and they will take care of you.\n\n3.Helmets \u2013 Just\nbecause you are not on a kinetic battlefield does not mean you do not need a\nhelmet. Tier-One units have a variety they use, but I suggest you stick with\nthe Crye Precision Airframe. Other operators will recognize how high-speed you\nare when you wear it. It actually serves two functional purposes. First, your\nbrain is all you have going for you. In cramped office and cubicles\nCyberwarriors will often stack collectibles. You can't have one of these action\nfigures falling on your head and putting you out of commission. Second, the\nCrye helmets have side rails for quickly attaching several high tech devices\nlike flashlights. I recommend the SureFire brand, since the guys doing the\nshooting may have to borrow yours one day and you don't want to hand them\nanything cheap. Make sure yours can do regular white light or green tinted\nlight. The best is a red tinted light that won't ruin your night vision when on\nan all night \"op.\" Believe me, giving away your position in your office at your\ndesk is a definite no-go.\n\n4.Armor \u2013\nCyberwarring is a dirty business. Sometimes things get hot. For those times, I\nsuggest you have a \"plate carrier\" and a good set of armor plates ready to go.\nTier-One guys expect their armor to stop AK-47 rounds and fragments from\nexplosives. You should as well. If it can stop a speeding 7.62x39mm bullet, think\nof the wonders it will do in office airsoft fights. You can stride through a\nhail of Nerf projectiles like they aren't even there. These plate carriers are\ndesigned to carry extra magazines for weapons, explosives, and other tools of\nthe Tier-One trade. You can use that space to carry extra Limitless energy\nshots, snacks, your ID, or reloads for your own Airsoft\/Nerf weapons. Don't cut\ncorners on the cost here. Your enemies can tell the difference between a Condor\nvest from the local Airsoft store and a real deal London Bridge Trading Company6094 plate carrier used by Navy SEALs. Learn the difference and make fun of the\nnerds with the cheap stuff. They are not Tier-Zero.\n\n5.Belt \u2013 Real \"shooters\"\nin the thick of it have special belts they can use to clip to a helicopter\nduring a hairy exfil or while going into a hot LZ. These are known as \"rigger'sbelts,\" and they have an extra hook that the operator can attach a lanyard to.\nThis keeps the operator in place. Tier-One ops don't fall out of aircraft or off\nof rooftops. A Tier-Zero specialist has a very similar use for a rigger's belt:\nwhen the cyber fighting goes hot, you will become a kidnapping target. You\nprobably already are, and just don't know it yet. A rigger's belt and lanyard\nwill allow you to clip yourself to a stationary object and foil any foreign\nintelligence agents' attempts to kidnap you. I suggest LBT for these items. Do\nnot clip yourself to something mobile, like a car, or something easily movable,\nlike your chair or an orange emergency cone. I would not put it past a spy to\njust steal the car or road cone to get to you. Protip: bulk up. Your natural\nobesity will make pulling you into a van or helicopter against your will much\nharder. If they want you, make them work for it.\n\n6.Guns \u2013 Of course\nCyberwarriors need guns. We're talking about blending in with the big boys,\nhere. I could spend hours on this topic alone, but I'll just give you a few\ntips and let OJT training cover the rest. You need good military-grade weapons.\nNot having them would be like a kid showing up to do pentests without\ninstalling NMap first. Poseur.\n\nSince civilians can't get military-grade\nweapons, buy weapons that look military-grade. I suggest a Daniel Defense M4A1SOCOM with a Leopuld HAMR scope. Daniel Defense makes a lot of gun parts for\nSOCOM, so the rifle makes you blend right in. For a pistol, go with a Sig Sauer226. The rifle needs to be in 5.56mm, and the 226 needs to be in 9mm. If\nanybody gives you crap about the weapon calibers, just smirk and blame the\nGeneva Convention or liberals, either works. The secret to dealing with caliber\nsnobs is to know they aren't listening to you, anyway. They are just waiting\nfor their turn to talk.\n\nHere is the hard part, though (you\ndidn't think this was just a shopping trip, did you?): you actually have to be\nable to shoot. Any time someone looks at your rifle, dropping some shooting\nlingo like, \"Yeah, its zeroed to two hundred meters,\" is a great response. The\nlingo is not a substitute for shooting, though. You have to be able to keep an\ninch group at 200 meters with your rifle and a two-inch group at 25 meters with\nyour pistol. Frown and silently shake your head at anyone who can't.\n\n7.Random other stuff - The Devil is in the details. Here's a list of the small things you'll need that\ndon't warrant their own sections:\n\nb.Flashlights - Carry two of these, as well. One should be an\ninsane 500 lumen-powered light, and the other should be something like a\nsurefire X300 that you can use on a rifle or pistol. If people ask why you have\na weapon light when you aren't carrying a weapon, just tell them you are always\nprepared. (Add a smirk here. It'll make them think you're prepared to take\nsomeone else's weapon if you don't have your own on you.)\n\nc.Paracord - This stuff is almost as useful as duct tape,\nwithout the disadvantage of making everything in your pockets stick together.\nParacord can come in the form of bracelets you can wear and unwrap when you\nneed it, but that's not Tier-Zero cool. Get a paracord sling for your rifle, a\nparacord strap for your computer bag. paracord bootlaces, paracord keychain. Make\nsome toys for your desk out of paracord. Finally, when you're good enough, make\nyour underwear out of paracord. Nobody ever expects paracord underwear.\n\nd.Multitool \u2013 You don't know what's gonna happen any time you step\noutside. Get a good multitool, like the Leatherman EOD MUT. It comes with a C4\npunch. Tier-One guys use C4 punches to put detonators in plastic explosives.\nYou can use one to deflate potato chip bags to fit in your desk. You can even\nuse it on bubble wrap.\n\ne.Gloves \u2013 With all this dangerous stuff, you need some gloves to\nkeep your typing assets in order. Do you know how hard it is to type with one\nhand? I suggest Oakley. Good, well made, hardcore protection for your knuckles,\nand they will insulate you from a very hot cup of coffee (Protip: Studies have\nbeen done on the body's ability to uptake caffeine more quickly from hot\nliquids. Elite Tier-Zero operators microwave their Mountain Dew.)\n\nf.Patches \u2013 As a Tier-Zero operator, you will be in a unit\nthat doesn't exist, so you won't have a unit patch. It's not cool to wear other\nunits' patches. You don't wanna give those dweebs credit for your awesome\nmissions. I wear Foxhound or Mandalorian unit patches as a form or psyops.\nEnemy intel agents will waste time and effort trying to figure out what unit\nyou are with. Let them. It's all part of the game.\n\nHow to talk\n\nStrangely, there's not much\ndifference between a Tier-Zero operator and a regular InfoSec professional.\nThink about it: DMZs, payloads, and perimeter threats? The language isn't that\ndifference. Throw in some gun lingo, and you're talking like a badass. Don't\ntalk about zombies, though. That's a dead giveaway that all of your tactical training\ncame from the Walking Dead. Instead\nof \"Zombie Killer,\" you should say \"Non-permissive environment specialist.\"\n\nWrapup\n\nThat's all the space I have for this issue. Next week we'll\ntalk about hacking techniques, identifying Nation-State weak spots, and getting\naccess to SCADA environments for testing new malware.

It started with sticks to knock down bananas. For the modern homo sapiens, it's tools like JavaScript and Hadoop.\n\nToday, I was working on a technical problem. I came across this blogpost from 2012 that had close to the answer I was looking for, but it missed a key detail that was important to me.\n\nWell, I follow the author on twitter, and the author follows me. So I sent him a tweet asking if he still had the data around, and whether he could analyze it again to solve my specific question. He responded with \"Just let me run a quick hadoop query for you\".\n\nMinutes later, he posted the results of the query to GitHub that had exactly what I was looking for.\n\nThis all took place within 30 minutes from start to finish. It's possible because we tool using homos have opposable thumbs that can grasp the blogs, the twitters, the github, and the hadoop. I don't know how many servers @jedisct1 has at his disposal, but in theory, with a few keystrokes, he could reach into the cloud (like Amazon's service) and marshall a thousand machines equalling a million dollar super computer to answer this small question for me.\n\nMonday, March 25, 2013\n\nFor those of you who play with virtual-machines like VMware, the Ubuntu server .iso contains an option for dramatically reducing the amount of memory needed. Using this option reduces the default installation's memory usage down to 66-megabytes. This is probably basic information for most of you, but I didn't know it, so I'm writing it up here."}

The Safer Internet Day is part of a global drive to promote a safer Internet for all users, in particular children and young people, and is organised by INSAFE, a European internet safety network co-funded by the European Commission.\n\nThe data presented in this News Release have been collected from the survey on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) usage in households and by individuals2 in the EU27, mainly carried out in the second quarter of 2010. More data on internet security and related topics can be found in the dedicated section on Information Society on the Eurostat website3.\n\n3% of internet users suffered financial loss\n\nIn the EU27 in 2010, almost one third of individuals (31%) who used the internet in the 12 months prior to the survey reported that they caught a virus or other computer infection4 resulting in loss of information or time during this period. The highest shares of internet users who caught a virus or other computer infection were found in Bulgaria (58%), Malta (50%), Slovakia (47%), Hungary (46%) and Italy (45%), and the lowest in Austria (14%), Ireland (15%), Finland (20%) and Germany (22%).\n\nAmong the individuals in the EU27 who used the internet in the last 12 months, 4% reported that they suffered from an abuse of personal information sent on the internet and\/or other privacy violations4 in this period, with the highest shares in Bulgaria and Spain (both 7%), Italy and the Netherlands (both 6%). In the same period, 3% of internet users in the EU27 suffered financial loss due to phishing or pharming attacks or fraudulent payment card use4, with the highest shares recorded in Latvia (8%), the UnitedKingdom (7%), Malta and Austria (both 5%).\n\nIn 2010 in the EU27, a large majority of individuals (84%) who used the internet in the last 12 months stated that they used an IT security software or tool4 to protect their private computer and data. Among the Member States, more than 90% of internet users in the Netherlands (96%), Luxembourg, Malta and Finland (all 91%) used IT security software, while it was less than two-thirds in Latvia (62%), Romania (64%) and Estonia (65%).\n\nUse of parental control software remains limited\n\nIn 2010, 14% of individuals in the EU27 who used the internet in the last 12 months and live in a household with children had a parental control or web filtering software4 installed. This share was highest in Luxembourg and Slovenia (both 25%), followed by France (24%), Denmark, Austria, the UnitedKingdom (all 21%) and Finland (20%).\n\nOf the individuals in the EU27 who used the internet in the last 12 months and live in a household with children, 5% reported that they experienced children accessing inappropriate websites or connecting with potentially dangerous persons4 while using a computer within the household. The highest shares were recorded in Italy (11%) and Latvia (9%).

The survey period was mainly the second quarter of 2010. Internet usage refers to those who reported using the internet during the 12 months prior to the survey. The security problems which these individuals experienced also relate to the 12 months prior to the survey. The indicators which refer to individuals living in a household with dependant children have been calculated especially for the purpose of this news release and are not available in the database. Dependant child is a child less than 16 years.\n\nCatching a virus or other computer infection (e.g. worm or Trojan horse): Computer systems could be infected with viruses, worms or Trojan horses which could damage personal computers and files, result in loss of time or money or other personal damage. A Trojan or Trojan horse is a non-self-replicating malware facilitating unauthorised access to the user's computer. Another example for computer infection is spyware which has installed itself on the computer to monitor and report on the respondent's computer activity.\n\nAbuse of personal information sent on the Internet and\/or other privacy violations (e.g. abuse of pictures, videos, personal data uploaded on community websites): Personal information sent on the internet are usually the name, address, and\/or e-mail details. Other privacy violations could be private pictures or videos uploaded over the internet and misused by third persons, or misuse of any personal details uploaded to community websites, i.e. sites used for social or professional networking.\n\nFinancial loss can be a result of receiving fraudulent messages ('phishing'), getting redirected to fake websites asking for personal information ('pharming') or can be due to fraudulent payment (credit or debit) card use.\n\nUse of an IT security software or tool to protect their private computer and data refers to the use of e.g. a firewall, anti-virus and anti-spam. The aim is to combat a wide range of threats, including worms, phishing attacks, Trojan horses and other malware. Anti-virus software scans files for infection using a dictionary and identifies suspicious behaviour from any installed computer program.\n\nA parental control or a web filtering software is software designed for controlling what content is permitted and for restricting material delivered over the internet. Parents may use this software to limit what sites children may view from computers at home.\n\nChildren accessing inappropriate websites or connecting with potentially dangerous persons refers to the use of the computer within the household. Mobile computers (laptop, handheld) are included but not phones.\n\nIncidents reported by internet users aged 16-74 who live in a household with children less than 16 years."}

{"text":"Above: Gary McKinnon and his mother, Janis Sharp. Below, a guest opinion post by Oxblood Ruffin, a writer and human rights activist based in Munich, Germany.\n\nGary McKinnon is a Scottish technical expert, or as he is referred to by US federal prosecutors, the perpetrator of \"the greatest military hack of all time.\" This claim is \"total fucking bullshit\", a phrase common amongst information security professionals.\n\nAlthough Mr. McKinnon has high name-recognition factor in the United Kingdom he is virtually unknown to the American public. He is a mentally challenged hacker who waltzed through ninety-seven US military Web sites before being caught. Mr. McKinnon was looking for evidence of UFOs. He has Asperger Syndrome, a form of autism. It doesn't make him Rain Man but it does create a different perceptual framework.\n\nGary McKinnon was arrested in the UK in November 2002 after a thirteen month hacking spree into US military networks. He was eventually caught because he used his own email address to download a program called RemotelyAnywhere. Before the bust McKinnon had been under surveillance by Britain's High Tech Crime Unit. But then he did that, dare I say, retarded thing.\n\nGary McKinnon left his email address plus a number of taunting messages such as, \"Your security is crap\" on US military servers. Personally, I think the messages were on the polite side. America's military network security is the cyber equivalent of Swiss cheese. My granny could have pulled off McKinnon's hacks and she was well in the grave before they even transpired. Because remember, if you wanted to intrude into US military sites in 2001 all you had to do was key in: user = guest; password = hello.\n\nAnd so Gary McKinnon was arrested by the High Tech Crime Unit in Britain. He detailed everything and confessed without an attorney being present. Now bear in mind, this is a guy who has Asperger and didn't fully comprehend the consequences of what he had done. Yet his confession was signed-off on, and the process began.\n\nUS Federal prosecutors told McKinnon's attorney that if he traveled to America and pleaded guilty that he'd only get eighteen months to three years in prison. McKinnon declined as the offer was not put in writing, although a similar offer was later filed in court papers. Accordingly, Mr. McKinnon was charged in the United States with seven counts of computer fraud at ten years per count [PDF Link] Then came the Lapdog Treaty.\n\nIn March 2003 - one year after Gary McKinnon was nabbed - David Blunkett (then home secretary to Tony Blair) secretly popped over to America to sign the 2003 Extradition Act. It was a legal arrangement between Britain and the US to fast track terrorists from one side of the Atlantic to the other. The terms of the agreement can most charitably be described as asymmetric. Legal scholars can have a wank-fest over the minutiae of the arrangement but it boils down to this. If America wants someone from the UK they need only apply reasonable suspicion. Whereas, if the UK wants someone from America then they must prove probable cause.\n\nReasonable suspicion is the standard to make an arrest; probable cause is the standard to indict.\n\nIn real terms, British prosecutors are required to surmount an evidential barrier that American defendants can contest before extradition to the UK. But American prosecutors can extradite any British citizen with substantially lower standards. Even if British citizens were not in the vicinity of a crime, they could not argue to the contrary. It's the law. Check it out on Google.\n\nThe sad fact is that it''s easier to extradite a British citizen to the US than it is to extradite a New York resident to California. If the 2003 Extradition Act were a two way street then one side would be a superhighway and the other side would be a dirt road, with potholes. Compounding this nonsense is that the treaty was intended to be applied to terrorists, and not utilized retroactively against mentally-challenged eccentrics.\n\nFrom McKinnon's arrest in 2002 to date, his case has garnered an extraordinary amount of ink in the UK. It started with hysterical claims by US federal prosecutors; traversed the fact and fiction of the file; included McKinnon's diagnosis as an Asperger sufferer; circumnavigated the extent of the British judicial system; personified McKinnon as the victim of the Lapdog Treaty; saw famous musicians record a song in his support, and celebrities flock to his cause; and generally, piss off the British press and every sensible person in the United Kingdom. All of this was in no small measure due to the efforts of Janis Sharp, Gary McKinnon's mother. She is best described as a cross between the mother that everyone would love to have and the Archangel Michael. For the atheists out there, this equation represents an ocean of love mixed with a tidal wave of whup-ass.\n\nAlthough most people accept that politicians steal candy from the same children they kiss for the cameras, the public draws the line at inhumanity. No government is allowed to play Russian roulette with a person's life. Because what is fundamental to this case, once you strain away Labour's craven mendacity, is that Gary McKinnon's life is at risk. He suffers from an anxiety-prone version of Asperger that is exacerbated by stress. And that is what the British public understands even if the government refuses to confront the truth. Does the Prime Minister actually want to hold a press conference several months from now and say, \"I regret to inform you that Gary McKinnon took his own life in an American prison because we failed to act\"?\n\nThe British public stopped asking for justice for Gary McKinnon some time ago. Now they're demanding it.\n\nIMAGES: Below, photos taken at a McKinnon rally in August, 2009, provided by Gary's mother. Oxblood says, \"The aubergine-hair-colored lady is Janis Sharp; the man with the angular face is Gary McKinnon; others = general protestors.\"\n\nMore at Boing BoingNixar never extradite a citizen to a foreign country, period.\n\nmdh\n\nkanTakuan\n\nnow you're calling Aspies Twinkies??!!\n\nItsumishi allow extradition of Chinese citizens to the US for hacking crimes?

Apparently the standard is lower for criminal cases. That seems horribly wrong.\n\nTakuan\n\nthe devil cannot abide to be mocked\n\nshaunoneil\n\n\"As an Aspie ..\"\n\nPlease note that the chap that claimed that being imprisoned for \"seven counts of computer fraud at ten years per count\", thousands of miles from any family, would severely aggravate this fellow's particular mental makeup, is (from wikipedia) \"Professor of Developmental Psychopathology in the Departments of Psychiatry and Experimental Psychology, a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Director of the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge\".\n\nWhile you may be intimately familiar with the particular form of Aspgerger's you've been delt, these aren't the comments of random bystanders. They're the medical opinions of leading experts in their fields.\n\ntoyg\n\nPeople arguing that \"he should be punished where the server is\" make me laugh. The US routinely refuse to accept the (otherwise commonly-held) notion that military personnel, while off-duty, should abide by the law of the land where they are physically located. An off-duty US soldier kills some people in a pub in (say) Japan, runs to his base, is shipped back to the States in no time and the US is under no obligation to punish him. But when somebody f*cks with a server\u2026 then physical location is all important! Give me a break.\n\nThis is just the US military flexing muscles because they've been found with their pants down. They are reacting like all bullies do: beating the little guy. That was to be expected. What it was not expected was the shameful behaviour of the UK government, so appallingly accepting of his new status as province of the northamerican empire, directly ruled from Washington. That extradition treaty is terrible and is obviously being misused. Labour should accept this fact and work to renegotiate it or drop it, but all politicians nowadays seem to be completely unable to accept they've been wrong, even when it results in them looking like Lemmings walking towards their electoral annihilation.\n\nMoriarty\n\n\"Bill Gates has Asperger's syndrome. Would you argue that he can never be held responsible for a crime because he's so mentally challenged?\"\n\nThere is a lot of speculation that he might, but he's undiagnosed. You shouldn't repeat that is if it's fact, considering the amount of misinformation around.\n\nAnd, obviously, it's a spectrum condition. Bill Gates' aspergers, if he has it, is almost certainly not like McKinnon's. Also remember that (bolded for general emphasis, not yelling at you) there is much more to aspergers than just being socially awkward and having intense interests. \"Nerd\" \/= aspie.\n\nAkula971\n\nWow , just when people over here in the UK thought that the US government could not get any more unpopular they did this. Just for the record, most British people did not want a war in Iraq, or to go into Afghanistan. We don't really approve of our poorly equipped troops being killed on a daily basis in support of American foreign oil policy. Our pathetic Labour government will be consigned to the scrap heap at the next election, because we will remember that they took us into an immoral illegal war. Most people think that the UK does not have a bill of rights, but we do and they like to keep it quiet. Made in1689, one of its provisions is that no UK citizen shall be subject to foreign laws.\n\nNote to American visiting the UK and Europe. Pretend to be Canadians\u2026LOL\n\nRazzabeth\n\nThe US is being an idiot. Why don't they do with this hacker what they have done with hackers in the past?\n\nUsually they say, \"You have done a very terrible thing, for which you may be terribly punished with many years in prison. Unless, of course, you agree to come and work for us.\"\n\nPerfect solution. US government gets their security upgraded by the man who broke it all down, damages and costs are reversed, mentally different man gets job security for the rest of his life while at the same time realizing the weight of what he did and being appropriately punished for it (by becoming a \"slave\", though a slave with health\/dental, sick pay, vacation time, pension, etc). UK government realizes their mistake when they let another government take a very valuable resource from their country. Everyone wins!\n\nAnonymous\n\nThose stressing the legal necessity of extraditing Gary have completely missed the point\u2026 it is to be done according to a treaty signed one year after the crime! THAT'S NOT LEGAL. So everyone can agree that the extradition is bullshit, and Gordon Brown is a craven prison bitch of a man for even letting things go this far.

Or the Northern Rock incident\n\nMadMoleculeAlso, here's a free debating tip: Responding to a point by saying \"whatever\" has never convinced anyone of anything.\n\nChundermutton\n\nWhy don't they just give the guy a job?\n\nAnonymous\n\n\"this is a guy who has Asperger and didn't fully comprehend the consequences of what he had done.\"\n\nIf he really has Asperger's, and not some other form of autism, then he knew exactly what he had done! People with Aspergers aren't mentally \"slow.\" Besides, if he learned how to hack sites, he had a very good understanding of what it meant and why others considered it wrong. Confessing before talking to a lawyer was stoopid, but can't be blamed on him being an Aspie.\n\nAntinous \/ Moderator\n\nIf he really has Asperger's, and not some other form of autism, then he knew exactly what he had done! People with Aspergers aren't mentally \"slow.\"\n\nI think that you grossly underestimate the effects of Asperger-related problems like the inability to comprehend metaphors. Daniel Tammet (whose IQ is in the 150s) talks about how hard it was for him to realize that \"Take a seat\" didn't mean \"Pick up a chair and leave.\" That kind of difficulty can seriously compromise one's ability to understand social constructs like private space. Some people with Asperger may have mild Aspie symptoms and not be particularly bright. Others might be geniuses with severe inabilities to function in the world. There's not a single profile.\n\nRevEng\n\nThat's a tough fight these people have on their hands.\n\nWhile this guy's intentions may have been, in some ways, honorable, he also broke dozens of federal laws. Defacing websites? Trying to access classified information? Guys, this is what computer laws were designed to protect against. It doesn't matter that he thought he would only get a few years, or that he wasn't trying to be malicious \u2014 he was fully aware that he was breaking the law.\n\nWhile I agree the US is going to take him to town (and make an example out of him), which is COMPLETELY unfair (you should be punished in accordance with your crimes, not in accordance with how much of a spectacle the court desires), the crime he committed was perpetrated mainly on American victims and broke American laws, so he should be tried in an American court under American law. If he doesn't like it, maybe he shouldn't have been hacking American military systems.\n\nMcKinnon is probably right. The US military's security is crap. They are probably hiding information about UFOs. But that's not an excuse to break the law and hack into their computer systems.\n\nIf he really was obsessed with it, maybe he can get a psychologist to claim he has some sort of insanity and toss him in a psyche ward. It's probably better than spending 70 years in a federal penitentiary.\n\nknodi\n\nI can see arguing that extradition isn't the best tool for this job\u2026 but this guy is NOT retarded. An autistic person probably wouldn't be held responsible for their actions, but asperger's is not the same thing. Bill Gates has Asperger's syndrome. Would you argue that he can never be held responsible for a crime because he's so mentally challenged?\n\nThis guy knew what he was doing was wrong. So his motive wasn't to give our secrets to the terrorists\u2026 Fine. Call that a mitigating circumstance. Don't extradite him; the british have a perfectly adequate court system.\n\nBut stop saying he's not guilty because he's \"not mentally competent\" or that \"he was only looking for proof of UFOs\". That's disingenuous, to say the least.\n\nLaws shouldn't be written so vague that they are then applied tangential things without consideration of severity.\n\npretending to shoot someone with a toy gun should not be prosecuted as severely as actualy shooting someone with a real gun.\n\nand as a Canadian who watches America go against NAFTA whenever it doesnt hand them the best deal (ignoring WTO), but applies it hard when it funnels them cash (taking enemies to task with WTO), I totally expect to see them making unfair deals such as the US\/UK extradition law for many years to come.\n\nMadMolecule\n\nThe reasonable suspicion\/probable cause issue seems to be a red herring in this case. If this article is to be believed, there's no real question as to whether he committed these cybercrimes; the \"probable cause\" and \"reasonable suspicion\" tests are both met.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I suspect the outrage here is because hacking is seen as a \"victimless\" crime. Which is absurd.\n\nAnonymous\n\nIve met people who are guilty and admit it. But I never met a person who is guilty, admits it and doesnt expect to do any time. The porblem is that not a lot of international law is written. Asperger syndrome aside, a crime was commited. Someone has to be punished. Just because a car is sitting on the street with keys in ignition does not mean that a person is free to take it. If he does, thats a crime.\n\nThe problem in this case is Asperger. I do not agree with the US stance on wanting to jail him. An appropriate sentence would be to take away his computer priveledges and put him on probation with observation.\n\nAntinous \/ Moderator\n\nSomeone has to be punished.\n\nThat's a deeply disturbing statement.\n\nAnonymous\n\nSo, US military sites can be hacked into by 'some guy' in the UK and the only way they found him was due to him stuffing around by sending messages and using his real email address.\n\nDo you think foreign governments are doing this without sending stupid remarks or using their 'real' email address.\n\nMaybe they should start the x-prize for US military sites. If you can hack in and you tell us how you did it, we'll give you $1,000,000. Pretty cheap for covering up such a major security hole IMHO.\n\nOnigorom\n\nIf one criminal steals from another criminal, would we call that a crime? Of course the criminal who is stolen from, would call it 'illegal'. The US have a vicious criminal record, and the military is a major part of it, so I don t think it is illegitimate to steal from them. Actually, I believe it is a moral obligation (but not necessarily a political one).\n\nLaw is nothing but a societal manifested form of violence. Law is a violation of law already. When we breach it we are subjected to this very form of violence. The hacker mimics the procedures of state institutions: if he were a nation state his activities would be called espionage. It is not the act of hacking but the fact that he is alone that subjects him to the law, to violence.\n\nAnonymous\n\nThe \"general protestor\" in the green jacket appears to be Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty.\n\nTakuan\n\nall he is guilty of is telling pompous bastards they aren't the center of the fucking universe.\n\nKanedaJones\n\n@Madmolecule\n\n\"If they don't prosecute, that will set a precedent that it's OK to hack into government computers as long as you don't hurt anything while you're in there.\"\n\nyour sentence breaks down into \"it will let people know its ok if you dont hurt anything\" and I find that funny.\n\nBut I'm assuming you really mean like how jaywalking isn't prosecuted often and we are so overrun by them?\n\nsound fine to me.\n\nand yes I know it costs a gazillion dollars for the US to ping the bastards who hack them.. so send people the bill when they do that.

Now whilst I can understand why there are some folk in the US that are a bit pissed about that happening, once again If it was some US bankers bringing down BP You can be damn sure the US wouldn't extradite them to the UK.\n\nThe aspergers thing is a bit of a side issue really.

The prankster is thus liable for every expense subject to his acts.\n\nTo all the left wingers who joyously proclaimed \"Obama was elected, The world is SAVED!\": Note that it is now Obama's justice dept that is continuing to try & lock the twit up.\n\nmdh\n\nkaneda \u2013 do you understand that the difference between a reason and an excuse is your own bloodlust?\n\nOxblood Ruffin\n\nWell, this has been fun. Who would have guessed that Gary McKinnon could excite so much discussion, some of it even reasonable.\n\nAt the end of the day the only thing that Mr. McKinnon's supporters want is that he is tried in the UK and receives proper healthcare.\n\nHe can either do time or community service, whatever the courts decide. But the paramount piece is that he receives psychological counseling and is talked down from the ledge of taking his own life.\n\nAlthough I do think that what he did was trivial, I don't believe it is excusable. There should be some consequences, but consequences commensurate with the actual crime; not a typical over-reaction to something that neither caused property damage nor physical harm.\n\nRob Beschizza\n\nThis case is obscured by the nonsense written about it; it's been heavily mythologized by the press in the U.K., which repeatedly suggests he's going to federal pound-me-in-the-a prison for the rest of his life, when if fact he's already turned down a publicly-disclosed deal that would have him out much sooner.The likely out come is that he'll be flown over, he'll receive a short custodial sentence, serve a few months and be shipped home. Everyone knows this, but it isn't a story that can be sold to little Englanders who want a nice Love Actually moment to cherish.\n\nMadMolecule\n\nInteresting you should use a word with such a specific meaning to describe something so vaguely related. I thought lawyerin' required razor sharp discourse.\n\nCorrect. It does. Surfing BoingBoing is not lawyering. You're still ignoring my point.\n\nI could also have pointed out the long established principle of the proportionality of the penalty, but it's evidently long been forgotten in the US (example: 3 strike bullshit).\n\nI haven't said a word about what penalty I think he should receive. I do believe, for the reasons I've stated above, that a penalty of some kind is fully appropriate.\n\n56: \"I'm sure we've both broken laws in our lives; does that mean we're incapable of commiting crimes against one another?\"\n\nNobody is incapable of commiting crimes, which is why there is a law. But to 'commit a crime' and to 'breach a law' are two entirely different aspects.\nMy point was that among criminals there is not such a thing as 'crime' if one's own group is concerned. And this resembles procedures of state. Historically, for example, the colonial robbery of land found later legal justifications ('private property').\nCases as the above just remind me of this genuine gesture of land grabbing, feeling oneself above the law and hoping that ones action will become law one day. \u2013 just to remind you of the pirate parties.\n\nNixarInteresting you should use a word with such a specific meaning to describe something so vaguely related.

{"text":"The Internet has become that much more dangerous in recent\nmonths, with several attacks using the Web to launch and spread into the mainstream.\nThese sophisticated threats make use of more than one attack vector. By Dominic\nK\n\nA\nblended threat is often referred to as a 'blended attack'. Some people\nrefer to these attacks as 'combined attacks' or 'mixed techniques'.\nA blended threat exploits one or more vulnerabilities as the main vector of\ninfection and may even perform additional network attacks such as denying services\nthrough a Denial of Service (DoS) attack against other systems. The use of multiple\nattack vectors increases the likelihood of successful infection and also makes\ncombating these threats more difficult.\n\nThe lethality parameters\n\nBlended threats can be lethal. They scan for vulnerabilities in an enterprise\nnetwork, enter via e-mail attachments, shared file folders, wireless devices,\nWeb pages, laptops, telnet and other entry-points. Once in, they quickly replicate,\nflooding and harming the network.\n\nSuch threats and attacks can enhance the severity of damage and speed of contagion\nby combining various methods. An attack using a blended approach might send\na virus via an e-mail attachment, along with a Trojan horse embedded in a HTML\nfile that will damage the recipient computer. Blended threats combine the characteristics\nof viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and malicious code with desktop, server, and\ngateway vulnerabilities to initiate, transmit, and spread an attack.\n\nSuch attacks usually attempt to infect networks using the techniques of a mass\ne-mail virus and also by attempting to find vulnerabilities in software that\nhave not been plugged, to infect or attack an operating system or application.\n\nUnravelling threat patterns\n\n\"A\nblended attack will come over multiple ports, such as SMTP or POP as well\nas HTTP. Sometimes the only pattern is that the target is the same for\neach of the attacks\"\n\n- Richard Steinnon\nCMO,\nFortinet\n\nBlended threats can be any combination of attack and propagation\nmethods. Many spread as worms\u2014programs that spread through vulnerabilities\nin a network. Unlike true viruses, worms do not depend upon other applications\nto work.\n\nNetwork or security administrators may suspect a blended threat\nattack if after cleaning and blocking a particular vector, infections return. For\ne.g. administrators determine that the initial infection arrived through peer-to-peer\n(P2P) protocols, but even after closing that vector and cleaning the systems,\ninfections continue.\n\nAccording to Richard Stiennon, CMO, Fortinet, \"A blended\nattack will come over multiple ports, such as SMTP or POP as well as HTTP. Sometimes\nthe only pattern is that the target is same for each of the attacks.\"\n\n\"Initiating, transmitting or spreading an attack through\nviruses, worms, Trojans and then exploiting vulnerabilities in a system is yet\nanother pattern\", adds Sunil Manglore, CEO Datacraft India. Such attacks\nhave more than one payload such as a backdoor installation and then launch a\nbuffer overflow or a DOS attack on the system. This propagates through various\nchannels such as e-mail and file-sharing network.\n\nIt is difficult to determine a blended threat because there is no single symptom\nof the problem. This is because there are problems occurring in different locations.\nFor example, if the enterprise has a solution from brand X at its gateway, an\nanti-virus solution on each desktop and a network device from some other vendor,\nthen each device's administrators will have a view of only his part of\nthe problem because the console deals with only the specific part. This limits\nthe administrators' ability to detect the vulnerability.\n\nGeneration Next threats\n\nNowadays, viruses or other malicious programs are released within a few days\nof any vulnerability being discovered. The gap has reduced to as little as one\nday. Hence, the patching window gets smaller, within which the malicious program\nexploits the system vulnerability and spreads rapidly.\n\nMany Trojans and bots make use of blended threats to infect\nand control infected systems. In 2006, backdoor Trojans and bots continued to\ncomprise a significant percentage of the malicious software detected by Microsoft,\nand therefore remain a top threat to consumers and business.\n\nSeemingly every day a new threat emerges, whether through Web attacks, spyware,\nmalicious mobile code, or phishing. Due to delay in the patching by a few hours,\nthe impact is devastating. As such malicious programs have immense capability\nto propagate and inflict damage. An organisation can be brought to its knees\nin a few hours. The MyDoom malware family caused between $73.2 bn and $89.5\nbn of damage worldwide.\n\nBlended threats strike with blinding speed. Unfortunately most enterprises are\nunprepared to handle these. One of the main problems faced by enterprises is\nthat they cannot determine that they have been hit by a blended attack.\n\nMany enterprises may not have internal expertise in managing complex blended\nthreats. If they do have services from system integrators, who have the required\nexpertise, they would still find it difficult to isolate and fix the problem.\nThe other issue is that solutions are usually purchased from more than one vendor\nand it takes time to correlate and find the root cause of a problem and then\nget back to the concerned vendor for support.\n\nFor example, in an organisation with multiple vendors, if there is a problem\nwith a desktop PC, the vendor might try to fix the desktop problem, and then\na problem might arise with the server. If the vendor who sold the security product\nfor the server is different from the one who sold the PC security tool, he would\ndisclaim responsibility. So, a lot of time is taken to fix the problem in a\nblended attack. This is because there are multiple vendors involved in the organisation\nand the entire procedure of trying to find solutions against multiple attacks\nbecomes quite cumbersome for a large organisation.\n\n\"SMBs would typically have neither the skills nor the resources to deal\nwith blended threats, because of the multiple attack vectors used. Larger companies\nwith MIS departments may also have difficulties repelling these threats because\nit is often difficult to justify the added expense in security products when\nthey have already invested heavily on existing equipment,\" says Stiennon\n\nThe worm propagation mechanism has the greatest impact on the health of a network.\nThe damage stems from a worm's intense network scanning, which consumes\nend-system CPU resources and accessibility, network device processing cycles,\nand network bandwidth. The rapid rate of infection and the aggressive scan\nrate cause traffic congestion and network instability.\n\nPrabhat Singh, Head \u2013 India, Security Response Operations, Symantec says,\n\"Blended threats are more lethal and dangerous as they blend in rootkit\ntechnology to hide on compromised machines. These threats are utilising spamming\ntechniques to spread faster and wider. The recent outbreak of Trojan.Peacomm\nblended almost everything. It arrived in a machine via a spam mail or it could\nbe dropped by the mass mailing worm named W32.Mixor.Q. It had the ability to\ninstall itself on machine as a device driver and hide itself. This threat was\naimed at creating a hidden peer to peer network such that each compromised machine\nis aware of its peers and such a network can be used effectively for various\ndestructive activities such as DoS and downloading new threats.\"\n\nBest practices to be followed\n\nUse the latest tools\n\nToday's products protect the network\nfrom end to end. Security manufacturers now offer comprehensive, system-wide\ndetection and reporting products that monitor vulnerabilities, manage security\npolicies and block threats before they enter. This could be used in conjunction\nwith advanced firewall software or appliances to manage entry of remote\nworkers via VPNs.\n\nSeal unnecessary entry points\n\nDiscover where FTP, telnet and other\npotentially unneeded functions can be removed, to further tighten security.\n\nChange passwords regularly\n\nCreate a password policy for remote workers\nand enforce the same across the enterprise. Strengthen the plan by requiring\nthat employees change their VPN and key application passwords routinely,\nevery six months or so.\n\nUpdate network software\n\nEnterprises need to ensure that applications\nare patched for security and upgraded as soon as updates become available.\nOr they can simply outsource network maintenance.\n\nEncourage common sense\n\nEnterprises can instruct the employees\nnot to open attachments unless they are expecting them. That may be easier\nsaid than done, but the results will save the IT staff some headache.\n\nFraming a response\n\nWebsense Security Labs informs that the number of phishing incidents, on average,\nhas been about three to six every day. In the current year, Voice-over-Internet-Protocol\n(VoIP) phishing has become the latest phenomenon. Blogs, personal Web hosting\nand social networking sites are also being utilised to host exploits, phishing,\nand fraud.\n\nCyber-criminals continue to use innovative social engineering techniques to\nfurther their exploits. Of the sites designed to steal credentials, almost 15\npercent are derived from toolkits, an emerging tactic from the hacker community.\n\nAccording to the Websense Security Labs H1 trends report,\na 100 percent increase has been noted in sites designed to install key loggers,\nscreen scrapers and other forms of crimeware. Conversely, Websense has seen\nmore than a 60 percent drop in Web sites designed merely to change user preferences,\nsuch as browser settings.\n\nSingh says \"In the first half of 2006, we have seen malicious code become\nmore covert, less recognisable, and motivated more than ever by economic gain.\nNot only have codes become more sophisticated, but the infrastructure supporting\nits creation and spread has also become more complex. Cyber-criminals are now\nmore creative, organised and business savvy\"\n\nCurrent trends in the threat space\n\nMoney motivated attacks such as banking\nTrojans which steal a user's identity to access his bank account\n\nDenial of service (DoS) attacks to extort\nmoney from e-commerce Web sites\n\nInternal threats from employees and trading\npartners. In fact, most of the security breaches emanate from internal\nbusiness networks\n\nInterconnected networks with no clear\nboundaries. As boundaries between networks disappear in order to connect\npartners and suppliers, multiple vulnerability points are introduced\n\nSecurity for Web services has been problematic\nand difficult to standardise and enforce across organisational\nboundaries, leaving enterprise network boundaries porous and permeable\n\nGrowing use of personal applications such\nas Web-based e-mail, instant messaging, and peer-to-peer applications\nprovide multiple points of entry for viruses, worms, and other\nattacks and provide a readily accessible means of disseminating proprietary\nand confidential information\n\nPhishing and pharming attacks: New schemes\nfor Internet-based fraud are difficult to stop, and they pose the risk\nof identity theft to unsuspecting customers and employees\n\nSpyware on the rise. Two-thirds of computers\nare infected with spyware\n\nSpam and spim: Unsolicited e-mail (spam)\naccounts for more than half of e-mail traffic, costing businesses billions\nper year. Instant messaging spam (spim) is also on a major rise\n\nStriking back\n\nEven with a diligent IT staff, enterprises may need to take a closer look at\nnetwork security. There are several reasons why a network may become vulnerable.\nOver time employees may inadvertently create vulnerabilities. Remote workers\naccess the network via laptops and PDAs, which can create potential security\nbreaches if their entry via a virtual private network (VPN) isn't fully\nprotected.\n\nTemporary employees and outside consultants who access the network and lack\nfamiliarity with security procedures may also leave ports unsecured. Traditional\nsecurity approaches have become outdated. Anti-virus measures alone can not\nstop blended threats. That is because these threats can enter via numerous insecure\nports, and spread so quickly, that an anti-virus application cannot be updated\nin time to contain the threat. In some cases, the blended threat infection rate\nis hundreds of PCs per second.\n\nFirewall software can be configured to prevent certain types of attacks from\nhappening in the first place provided it is fine tuned and monitored regularly.\nWorms and viruses will continue to be successful as long as computing resources\nhave security vulnerabilities that can be exploited. To protect itself, an enterprise\nmust implement a comprehensive, multilayered, enterprise-wide security strategy\nthat protects against both known and unknown outbreaks, simultaneously.\n\nNo single product can protect an organisation from an outbreak. Prevention measures\nmust be a part of a comprehensive strategy that is properly implemented across\nthe enterprise to create a complete line of defence.\n\nThis strategy must include a combination of solutions and processes, as a part\nof an established security policy that mitigates the impact of an outbreak if\nan unknown worm or virus does manage to get inside the organisation. Although\nmost enterprises have put a security policy in place, more discipline is needed\nto ensure that these policies are updated on a regular basis based on the company's\nneeds, the current environment and threats.\n\nEqually important is for employees of respective organisations to strictly adhere\nto and follow the company's security policy. Finally, the enterprise IT\narchitects such as CSOs, CIOs and CTOs, must manage and mitigate security and\nprivacy related risks that dramatically affect their profitability, corporate\ngovernance and compliance imperatives. From simple yet insidious to complex\nand pervasive, these security challenges threaten to overwhelm business boundaries\nand protection mechanisms, thus requiring an increasing share of management\nattention and IT resources."}

{"text":"POSTS:\n\nOnline criminals have many tools for committing fraud and theft, including phishing and, increasingly, malware.\n\nMalware (e.g., viruses) can steal your passwords from keyboards or GUIs, scour your computer for sensitive account numbers, send spam to your friends, host criminal material without your knowledge, and even wait for you to log in to an online bank account and then add another transaction just as you're about to log out.\n\nHow bad is the problem?\n\nCurrently, industry sources estimate that 0.25% of infected computers are directly involved in financial fraud. But with malware penetrating 10-15% [pdf] of ALL computers connected to the Internet, converting these computers into tools for committing financial fraud (which can easily happen) would result in an instant fifty-fold increase of fraud. To put this in perspective, most businesses would fail \u2013 or fold their Internet operations \u2013 long before this happened.\n\nMisaligned incentives aggravate the problem. In the U.S., financial service providers commonly bear financial responsibility for fraud, though most available malware countermeasures are designed for client-side use. In other words: the people who stand to lose the most money can't do much to protect themselves.\n\nMobile malware: our Achilles' heel\n\nThe inherent limitations of smartphones \u2013 power, memory, bandwidth \u2013 make most anti-virus tools unsuitable once the rate of malware instances reaches a certain threshold, because smartphones can't handle the updates that PCs currently have to.\n\nFor example: with around forty thousand new instances of PC malware a day, there are nearly 100 daily updates of anti-virus filter rules that laptops or desktops currently handle, but that would be difficult for a smartphone to manage. Of course, it's not only about receiving updates. The device also has to screen for infection, which is a very demanding and resource-draining task for mobile phones.\n\nSo what happens when malware authors start developing viruses for smartphones at the rate they currently do for personal computers? We may not have to wait long to find out, because mobile platforms are rich with data and are convenient payment platforms ripe for defrauding.\n\nBeyond incremental solutions\n\nWe must find better solutions before it's too late. We're in trouble as soon as soon as malware authors start giving phones serious attention. And we can't use current strategies to combat the problem, because the mobile context is so much more vulnerable and resource-constrained.\n\nThis is not about tweaking what we already have.\n\nI believe we need to think of combatting malware in a completely different way than we're used to. We need tools that use less machine resources. We also need ways to identify the malicious acts that already took place, because the threats spread rapidly, undetected, and often before defense measures are implemented \u2013 retroactive or post-mortem detection is necessary because with the current pace of the problem, we simply cannot hope to catch things in time. We need to centralize detection to avoid burdening cell phones with this task."}

This week, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Industrial Control System Computer Emergency Response Team announced that it felt that Tridium, a tech firm in Virginia, had fixed the security problems[2].\n\nThis example demonstrates that control systems have developed into the main target in the cyber world today. These ubiquitous programs essentially run everything, and they have great potential\u2014but also great vulnerability.\n\nNF is widely used (300,000 users in 52 countries), and chances are you have used a service that was controlled by it.

According to the article, entire computers are being replaced by the government because it's feared the attackers may have stored \"...malicious code in the BIOS flash memory.\" The government department officials said even wiping the hard drives might not make the computers safe to use.\n\nA post on SolutionWatch.com gave a pretty good overview of web applications, especially with respect for use in educational settings. One potential problem, though, is what do you do if there are major security problems or an extended web outage and a significant amount of your data and the applications you use to do computer work are on the web. Maybe the answer is that if the web becomes so insecure or unreliable that a person can't trust it to store their data or to provide apps to process that data, then there are much bigger problems than how to retrieve or store our files.\n\nThe article about the Chinese attacks, as well as articles linked from the PCWorld 'spyware & security' webpage and other malware articles in the news lately reinforced the point that malware writers have a continual improvement goal. They work hard to be good at being bad guys. The articles also reinforced the opinions of Dan Ratner and Chunka Mui, two smart guys from the Chicago area, who stated at an MIT Enterprise Forum in Chicago earlier this year that security on the 'net will get much worse before it gets better.\n\nCombine implications of the above articles and posts with an article about college student's expectations that the 'net and technology will be available everywhere and always in good working order. Shake well and out comes a mixture guaranteed to result in some interesting times. There is also a certain level of expectation on the part of young people that their online information requires no more care and feeding than does their cell phone or their iPod or their tv. As loosely controlled and protected as the 'net is, one has to wonder how it has lasted this long without falling apart or being torn apart. Is the long term future of the 'net one of sunshine and fun, or one where only gunslingers with no data to lose dare venture.

I treat my account like a photo diary cos I genuinly belive some stuff is share worthy, however I have never photographed food or coffee. Also I use and account for a small clothing label and drop the logo discretly in every photo. If they reuse them photos then theres some free advertising.\n\nIt would ruin photos but a tiny tiny discreet logo or watermark would ruin the stock photo idea!\n\nI dont understand why its taken so long to come into football, its not like there isnt the money.\n\nI do wonder though how long it is until it goes against us, a last min goal against england in the semi finals and we'll try and blame the equipment like people say the lie detector is broke on Jeremy Kyle."}
{"text":"Posts Tagged 'Veracode'\n\nMany of the high profile security breaches are caused not by digital means alone. Hackers fool people into providing access information that let's them in a system, and often, it's difficult to close the back doors they install.\n\nThese cever social engineers find ways to manipulate people into giving up personal information.\n\nIn its infographic (see below) \"Hacking the Mind,\" Veracode details the most common types of human hacking, including phishing, hoaxes and shoulder surfing.\n\nMost people have seen these social engineering attempts in their spam folders (emails that claim to be from a secret admirer) and our Twitter feeds.\n\nEmails from fake secret admirers and tweets from fake friends with links to funny pictures have become commonplace, but cyber thieves are getting more creative, digging further into personal lives via social networks, and capitalizing on the emotions of their targets.\n\nOne example, cited in Chris Hadnagy's bookSocial Engineering: The Art Of Human Hacking, describes a CEO that was duped through a charity scam by hackers who learned of an ill family member via his Facebook page.\n\nThe social engineers sent the CEO an email asking him to donate to a cancer research fund, however a PDF attached to the email was actually malware that took over the CEO's computer when he opened it.\n\n\"Social engineering will, remain at the forefront of security awareness education for the foreseeable future because it preys on weaknesses in human behavior, making it very difficult to prevent,\" said Chris Eng, Vice President of Research at Veracode.\n\n\"These criminals don't bother with developing and planning a sophisticated technical hack because they can just trick someone into giving them access they need.\"\n\nWhile hacker strategies and malware are becoming increasingly complex, one of the most popular methods of accessing private accounts like banking, remains one of the most simple in concept. The art of manipulating people into unwittingly surrendering private data is nothing new.\n\nVeracode recommends enterprise organizations implement annual security awareness training to put a spotlight on what risks are out there and to reinforce policies that will help protect businesses and individuals from falling prey to these types of scams.\n\nVeracode's annual \"State of Software Security Report\" reveals that 84 percent of web applications from public companies were deemed unacceptable when measured against the OWASP Top 10, a widely used industry standard list of critical and most frequently exploited web application vulnerabilities.\n\nNon-web applications such as backend operational systems and desktop commercial applications in use at public companies also showed a poor performance with a 63 percent failure rate when measured against the CWE\/SANS Top 25 \u2013 an industry standard list of critical non-web application vulnerabilities.\n\nUnlike previous Veracode State of Software Security reports, this feature supplement hones in particularly on the vulnerabilities in the software applications of publicly traded companies, following new SEC guidance issued in the US last year relating to disclosure of cybersecurity risks in company filings.\n\nRegulators looking at company cybersecurity\n\n\"Companies \u2013 particularly public ones \u2013 are beginning to be measured by regulators and investors on the strength of their cybersecurity solution and ability to protect intellectual property and customer data. This is a fundamental shift,\" said Chris Wysopal, founder, CISO and CTO, Veracode.\n\n\"Companies can put all of the other cybersecurity controls in place but if there are application weaknesses, hackers have the will and time to find and exploit them. The issue simply can not be neglected anymore.\"\n\nHe adds, \"Over the last year some of the most prominent breaches that were carried out against the most preeminent names in business took advantage of weaknesses in software applications to infiltrate traditional perimeter defence security controls. This should be a wake up call. Particularly in public company disclosures, the issue needs to be discussed in much more detail.\"\n\nPublic companies fare no better than companies at large on software security or developer knowledge: Despite public companies having greater compliance requirements and usually more funding, only 16 percent of public company web applications passed initial testing compared to 14 percent for all companies at large \u2013 as measured by compliance against the OWASP Top 10 industry standard.\n\nPerformance worse for public firms\n\nThe performance for non-web applications is worse for public companies, with 38 percent passing against the CWE\/SANS industry standard opposed to 42 percent from all companies.\n\nReliance on third-party applications is widespread, but formal risk assessments are not: With many applications being bought as commercial-off-the-shelf applications, custom developed outsourced projects or software-as-a-service, managing the risks inherited from third parties is an important factor.\n\nHowever, only one in five public companies has performed a formal verification on a third-party application, suggesting they are operating under a false sense of security or making an assumption that software procured from third-parties is secure upon entry.\n\nNew vulnerabilities being introduced\n\nFlat prevalence rates since 2012: With the two most frequently exploited vulnerability types \u2013 XSS and SQL injections \u2013 showing a statistically flat incidence rate from the first quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011, the results suggest that new vulnerabilities are being introduced at the same rate as known vulnerabilities are being remediated.\n\nMany companies defining custom policy chose to measure applications against PCI: Over 40 percent of public companies who defined a custom policy chose to measure their application against PCI or the OWASP Top 10 standard which underpins PCI. The main focus is on vulnerabilities that are most frequently exploited such as SQL Injection and Cross-site scripting.\n\nVeracode Inc., which sells cloud-based application security testing, has created an infographic on Social Media Basics.\n\nThis infographic examines various types of targeted attacks and focuses on malware's history of infecting Twitter and Facebook.\n\nTo minimize risks, the image summarizes advice such as being aware of trending topics as a popular lure, protecting passwords and being wary of Facebook spam. In a related webinar, Veracode addresses the ubiquity of social media applications and the challenges facing enterprise infosecurity organizations in how they manage usage across the workforce. The webinar is available on-demand at\n\n\"This infographic reinforces that enterprises must balance the allure of social media with risks for viruses and attacks,\" said Connie Stack, vice president of corporate marketing, Veracode. \"While it may not be realistic to have your workforce avoid all forms of social media, it's important to educate employees on social media safety and best practices to reduce a company's risk from costly losses and data theft.\"\n\nVeracode, Inc., provider of the world's only independent, cloud-based application risk management platform, has created an infographic, \"Google vs. Facebook on Privacy and Security,\" that takes a look at how the two firms stack up against each otehr when it comes to handling privacy and security concerns."}

{"text":"It sounds like the subject of a Hollywood thriller or paperback science fiction novel. Hackers surrounded by glowing LCD screens watching as money drains from your bank account into theirs. Cybercrime: a new crime for the digital age. Or is it? Is cybercrime something new or is it just a new spin on the familiar old crimes?\n\nCybercrime has no established definition. On the broadest interpretation it could include any criminal act committed via computer or the Internet. But what distinguishes theft from your online banking account and theft by someone impersonating you in the branch or forging your signature on a cheque? For many crimes involving computers, the essential elements are the same as the traditional crime and recognizing a distinction when a computer is used does not make sense. A computer does not aggravate a theft in the way that a weapon does (by increasing the likelihood of bodily harm) it is merely a method of committing the same crime. For \"cybercrime\" to be coherent as a category, it must be in some way distinct from recognized traditional crimes: cybercrimes are those criminal acts that are unique to computers.\n\nBut some would argue that there are no crimes that meet this definition. In a 2001 article and a recent follow-up, Professor Susan Brenner argues that all known cybercrimes can be encompassed, with a little effort, by existing crimes. Consider a few candidates for pure cybercrimes: hacking, denial of service, and distributing malicious software. These are criminal acts which take place in \"cyberspace\". But each of them has a real-world analogue: hacking can be viewed as a form of digital trespass; denial of service is vandalism or common nuisance; malicious software is mischief or theft of processing power. Thus, even these acts are like the example of theft in the previous paragraph: merely traditional crimes carried out through the medium of cyberspace. The solution is not to invent new crimes but to revise existing ones to accommodate changing situations. Brenner does, however, suggest the possibility of true cybercrimes (acts only possible in cyberspace) emerging in the future. There is even a precedent for criminalizing acts that take place in another realm\u2014witchcraft. It was once believed that witches manipulated spirits in another realm to harm their victims much like cyber-criminals act in cyberspace to harm their victims. But for the present time Brenner concludes that traditional crimes are enough.\n\nOne troubling aspect of Brenner's argument is its reliance on the concept of \"cyberspace\". Cyberspace allows you to easily draw analogies between real and virtual actions\u2014for example, associating hacking with trespassing. But cyberspace is just a metaphor. It is useful for explaining the relationships between computers, but it leads to inaccuracy in describing the actions of people online. It is certainly possible to redefine the legal understanding of location to match this metaphor, but just because something is possible doesn't make it right. Without relying on cyberspace, the ability to remotely access and manipulate another person's property is actually something new but still easily described: the Criminal Code calls it unauthorized use of a computer. The provision does not criminalize \"digital trespass\" but rather unauthorized access, which is an accurate non-metaphorical description of the act we wish to proscribe. This is a cybercrime. It is not a pure cybercrime in the sense that Brenner is looking for, but it is a distinct criminal act in which computers play an essential role.\n\nThe Criminal Code provision also highlights another problem with extending real-world crimes to encompass virtual counterparts. Unauthorized use of a computer is classified in the Code alongside theft rather than breaking and entering. This demonstrates that there may be multiple candidate offenses for a single cybercrime. What can be clearly defined as a separate crime becomes muddled if we try to force it into existing categories. If only for practical reasons, it makes sense to treat it differently.\n\nThe global reach of the Internet and the power and flexibility of computers allow us to interact in brand new ways. Sometimes this merely provides a new method to commit an old crime. But there are some crimes\u2014cybercrimes\u2014in which the role of the computer renders them practically distinct."}
{"text":"AT&T (T), as well as at least 47 other carriers, were recently identified as having vulnerabilities that leave them open to hijacking.\n\nThe vulnerability that has been identified by computer scientists allows \"attackers to surreptitiously hijack the Internet connections of smartphone users and inject malicious content into the traffic passing between them and trusted websites.\" This is not what we want form a mobile data carrier. We want to know that we are surfing the web on our phones easily and without any interference from an outside entity at all. The vulnerability is caused by a certain firewall that mobile carriers use. Essentially the weakness lies in the very method used by the carriers to protect your data.\n\nIf you are a victim of this form of sabotage, you could suddenly find that you have done things on Facebook or Twitter that you did not actually do. In addition, this can be used more seriously to direct you to a banking website that is not genuine. If this happens, the hacker may be able to gain access to your funds. The hijacker could also use this to send fake messages in apps such as Window Live Messenger from your account.

{"text":"In an unexpected move for a security company, SecurEnvoy today said that cyber break-ins and advanced malware incidents, such as the recent DDoS attack by LulzSec, should actually be welcomed and their initiators applauded. The company's CTO Andy Kemshall said: \"I firmly believe that the media attention LulzSec's DDoS attack has recently received is deserving. It's thanks to these guys, who're exposing the blase attitudes of government and businesses without any personal financial gain, that will make a difference in the long term to the security being put in place to protect our own personal data!\"\n\n\"I'd suggest that DDoS vulnerability is indeed a security issue. Security is not just concerned with protecting the information in that one box. It is also concerned with protecting the system resources for legitimate use. A denial of service removes resources from legitimate users.\"\n\nThis is all true, however you've overlooked a crucial element: in a well designed large scale DDoS attack, the victim doesn't know the attackers from legitimate customers.\n\n\"If your network gets flooded out by packets, you have a security mechanism failing to filter packets properly.\"\n\nTwo problems:\n1. A filter is useless when the attacker's botnet has more bandwidth than you. Even an OC3 (which was considered large enough for my whole university) is easily saturated by a few hundred broadband users.\n\n2. What kind of filter do you use? If you detect excessive bandwidth on an IP you can block it, but it may or may not be legitimate. Consider a bunch of mobile users being a proxy\/nat router, you're filter could inadvertently block all of them.\n\n\"If your software gets crashed into a denial of service condition, you have an exploitable vulnerability in the code that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nWell granted, the software should never crash. In the worse case, a busy server should start returning something like error 500 in http-speak.\n\n\"If your website takes down your webserver due to resource exhaustion through a designed website function, you have site code that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nYou're totally oversimplifying the issue to imply that code is at fault. Assuming you actually have enough bandwidth in the first place (which isn't likely for most small\/medium businesses), then there are other local bottlenecks which will require infrastructure upgrades to eliminate. Databases quickly become saturated. Even ordinary web servers can start thrashing if the attackers deliberately request pieces of material which are unlikely to be cached. This causes random disks seeks well in excess of normal load. A typical disk seek is 5ms, if the attacker successfully requests an uncached file each time, then both normal users and attackers will reach a limit of 200 requests\/sec.\n\n\"The information systems are a business resource that need to be protected in addition to the information those systems house. Denial of service demonstrates an exploitable flaw in the security of those systems.\"\n\nHopefully I've gotten my point across that being vulnerable to DDoS doesn't imply a security vulnerability. As Soulbender stated already \"Availability != security.\"\n\nI'd gladly discuss any usable ideas you have, but DDoS isn't as easy to solve as you make it out.\n\nIf you get blown off the network by a flood you technology can not at all deal with then fair enough. The issue is not mitigting the risk of denial of service and getting blown off by deciding to ignore it outright; \"DDoS isn't our responsability and even if it was, we'll just get hit with volumes that our physical network medium can't even handle.\"\n\nCompartmentalization - try to keep a denial of service on one system from taking out other systems\n\nIf we have a hode of random addresses cooperating to keep the server busy; throttle them so the server hardware can at least keep up rather than become completely unusable. Block all but known good addresses if your in such a situation the public service is secondary to specific clients\/partners who use it. Drop an IPS in front of the box and let it help manage the hit.\n\nI mean, if you've done what you can to mitigate denial of service attacks and your upstream provider is litterally over-run then fair enough. If you simply discount denial of service as \"not a security concern\" then; security fail.\n\n\"I would agree that avaiability does not mean one is secure. I would not agree that availability is not a security concern.\"\n\nLet me put forward the notion that if availability is a security concern, then the internet is not really a suitable medium.\n\nHypothetical a country may have a grid of warhead detecting radars. These radars are considered to be of paramount importance with near-absolute availability. They bring in a team of security experts to eliminate all possible vulnerabilities. They factor in all possibilities, including spies leaking details of the project (no security by obscurity). Now that they've addressed the security issues, can they rely on the internet to provide the necessary availability?\n\nI expect the answer is \"no\".\n\nI realize this skews the discussion a little bit, and that your talking about exploiting code scalability issues, but I think the point still stands; one cannot secure availability on the internet.\n\n\"If your systems are getting hammered by malicious intent, maybe you need an IPS on the line to defend your systems.\"\n\nThe problem with DDoS is that no one has intruded onto the system in the typical sense. The attacker is flooding servers with otherwise innocuous traffic.\n\n\"If your webform is chewing up your server resources, maybe you need some throttling in place.\"\n\nHow do you keep the throttle from affecting normal users?\n\n\"If the denial of service is caused as a misdirection or cover for a breakin that is most definately a security issue.\"\n\nYes but in general the DDoS *is* the damage, not a cover for some other nefarious activity.\n\n\"If we refer to IBM's ten principles of secure software design...\"\n\nYou have me at a disadvantage here, I've never heard of them.\n\n\"If we have a hode of random addresses cooperating to keep the server busy; throttle them so the server hardware can at least keep up rather than become completely unusable.\"\n\nWell, apache tends to respond with error messages when it gets overloaded. Is this what you mean by degrading gracefully? If not, then what do you mean?\n\n\"Block all but known good addresses if your in such a situation the public service is secondary to specific clients\/partners who use it.\"\n\nThis will block legitimate users too, but my bigger question is how to put this into practice. Would you envision a process which scans web server logs heuristically for IP addresses and then loads them into iptables? Something more sophisticated? This list could become overwhelmingly large. What if bad IPs make it through the whitelist or the IPs are faked?\n\n\"Drop an IPS in front of the box and let it help manage the hit.\"\n\nTo the extent that it can determine which requests are legitimate, then that's great, but in practice it can be impossible to tell, an IPS has even less information to go by than the application server.\n\n\"I mean, if you've done what you can to mitigate denial of service attacks and your upstream provider is litterally over-run then fair enough. If you simply discount denial of service as 'not a security concern' then; security fail.\"\n\nThat's the opposite of what I'm claiming. It's an \"availability fail\", but the security is still intact.\n\nI guess we're just arguing semantics here, but I'd rather that the media distinguish between actual security failings and denial of service related downtime. Otherwise we'd start to hear about about \"security flaws\" every time a company's servers were overloaded"}

{"text":"The refrain \"make it too expensive for the attackers\" needs to be retired from the security professional's vocabulary. It is not going to happen. Making it \"too expensive\" is not S.M.A.R.T. It also means absolutely nothing to the attackers. The guidance security professionals need to be pushing is that managed business processes and security controls will reduce the overall cost associated with responding to each attack as they are experienced. It is not a matter of who will do the attacking, when they will do it, or how many resources they have behind them. It is the understanding that attacks are going to occur, most attacks will involve techniques to which an organization can identify and respond, and some attacks will occur using new methodologies and technologies to which the organization can identify and respond.\n\nAttacker's Viewpoint\n\nLet's take a look at the malicious hacker list Roger Grimes put together (which I like very much, BTW) and see how each group is affected by the overall \"expense\" of their efforts..\n\nCyber criminals: as these people are after big financial gain they understand that there will be cost involved with their efforts. The bigger the pay-out the more time and effort they are willing to spend. However, they just don't turn away from targets. Hard targets are softened by time. Over time there will be new vulnerabilities, new attack methodologies, new personnel, etc. If something is currently difficult they may roll over to other prey, but they will come back around.\n\nSpammers and adware spreaders: these attackers are generally not concerned with specific targets. However, the way spammers and adware spreaders conduct their business is interesting to other malicious hackers. The research and development of this group can easily be leveraged for other purposes. They try everything in the book and then write new pages when those do not work any more. They are not concerned about how much it costs to get around your controls because they are best at presenting a moving target. Basically making it more expensive for customers to keep up with them.\n\nAdvanced persistent threat (APT) agents: these guys are good at getting in. They are also good at being patient. Biding their time for specific opportunities. They try a few things to get in and, if that doesn't work, they try something else. As they have multiple targets (or so it appears) they move onto the next target on their list. Then, after a time, they roll back to a targeted organization where their tactics have been unsuccessful and they try something else. Security programs and controls are not making it more expensive for them. They know it is a part of the game and they just continue until they are successful.\n\nCorporate spies: well, this attacker is most likely (yes, I'm guessing) expensive to begin with. I have not run into any of these people or cases, nor have I heard much about them. But, I understand the mentality. They could be heavily trained or simply people exploiting an opportunity. These people are usually in a position where they can manipulate the security controls, or feel they can get away with their efforts despite the controls. In other words, the reward already out-weighs the risk.\n\nHacktivists: this group is probably the most affected by the cost of their efforts. However, they will most likely be associated with the Rogue hacker category and thereby reap the rewards of their efforts. Which, in turn, means that cost does not affect them much as they rely on targets of opportunity that will produce the actions they desire.\n\nCyber warriors: although military commanders do take into consideration cost of resources, their limits are beyond those of most corporations. Additionally, once the cost reaches a certain point then the tactics for this group changes to kinetic solutions.\n\nRogue hackers: one word for these guys: \"challenge.\" If it is a challenge is it really too expensive? To this group time and effort is nothing. Once they set their sights they either work it till they are bored with it or they accomplish their objectives. If a group of these individuals gets their collective heads together, then cost matters even less. Certainly a good security effort will prevent many unmotivated rogue hackers, but those that are motivated have a purpose where cost is of little consequence.\n\nIn Need of a New Catchphrase\n\nTherefore I say out with the old refrain and in with something new. Preferably something that is a little more Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. I prefer more direct and implementable guidance that helps build cross-functional incident response efforts and teams. However, for those who require those \"elevator statements\" (don't we all at some point) maybe try one of my favorites: \"reducing the gap between compromise and identification.\" Because the old \"make it too expensive for the attackers\" statement is placing the wrong emphasis on the overall effort and makes people, particularly executives, think that 100% secure is an obtainable goal. When we all know that information security is a sustained effort that will continue as long as the organization exists."}
{"text":"I really hate this,As a network professionals(i am not a professional,but asking in general) can't we do nothing other than complaining?\n\nAlso what can we do to track the original source of the attack? I know it is really hard,but i don't think it is impossible to do ...\n\nThis is akin to asking: \"Someone stole John Doe's gun and took shots at me. Is it ok for me to shoot at John Doe?\"\n\nMost botnets consist of machines that have been compromised. The end owners of those machines are unaware their machines are behaving badly. For you to counterattack these machines would be criminal point blank.It's not that law enforcement don't really care on the contrary they do care about these attacks. If you take note of the above comment I made, there is little they can do as it is difficult to track down who created a botnet.\n\nAs for ISP's taking a stand, some do, some don't. Same rules apply. Good ISP's take DDoS attacks seriously but they cannot go as far as blocking say an upstream because again, they're caught in the cross-fire.The issue with botnets is and forever will be the underlying issue of \"people don't know their machines are behaving badly.\" Trying to send out thousand of emails to the different providers often yields little since it is likely they've been overwhelmed at the amount of e-mail they're receiving and or received already. Blacklisting works when done properly but if you could find the bullet-proof solution to this, I guarantee you that you will be a billionaire in no time. Many companies try and they all fail because the logic of countering is flawed. You can block N amount of machines until the cows come home but depending on someone's botnet, all the attacker has to do is jump onto a C&C and send from different hosts.\n\nCounterattacking a botnet is not only criminal, it's outright stupid. You're already being saturated with traffic, why add more traffic on a counter attack. Load balancing helps as does BCP filtering however, if BCP filtering isn't done across the whole link, its useless.\n\nBotnets get shutdown, it just takes time. Like Sil said, the challenge is trying to figure out who is controlling the botnet. Going after the poor dope whos computer was infected hardly makes any sense. Another one will easily take his place.\n\nRecently, the Mariposa botnet was shut down. It took a ridiculous amount of collaboration to shut it down:\n\nwhat about routing the \"attacks \" or \"traffic\" of \"attacking class\" sat syn flood and re-direct them to some ip's and filtering them? and also is there any chances to hack one of the zombie with the traffic send by one of the zombie?\n\ndid any body tried like this?\n\nalso i have seen some companies tracking down the original source of dos attacks with out law enforcing authorities involved,how they are doing it?\n\nIn order to track the source of a DOS, you must have cooperation from the networks where traffic is coming from. Basically, you're going to follow the trail hop by hop. Each hop must cooperate with you. In some cases, this is possible, but as it has been pointed out, it takes an inordinate amount of cooperation.\n\nIf the attacker is smart, the attacker will use nodes that are geographically dispersed and will have traffic coming from countries that are known to be difficult to work with. This slows the process considerably, and in most cases will thwart your efforts completely."}

{"text":"According to The Wall Street Journal,\n\n.\n\nUS intelligence became aware of the problem when agents found videose from Predator drones saved on captured insurgent laptops. According to senior officials who spoke to The Wall Street Journal, seized laptops contained what amounts to days of footage. To get an idea of what that footage looked like, you can watch our annotated video of a Predator drone missile strike.\n\n\n\nAnd while The Wall Street Journal blames Iran for teaching the insurgents how to conduct this counter-intelligence operation, I have a hunch that the Iraqis were just trying to download a bootleg copy of Avatar, and simply snatched the wrong file. Torrents can be tricky like that.\n\nHacking suggests that there were deliberate attempts to secure data by either encrypting the signal or using unique video encoding (or maybe both at the same time). The software, mentioned in the WSJ, is apparently for bootlegging satellite TV. It's a video decoder. It just like trying to play a video that you do not have the codec for. Go find it, and you can watch the video. I can't call it hacking.\n\nThat the video feed from the Predator is no more complex to decode than satellite TV, does not reflect well on General Atomic and the Air Force's choice in design specs.\n\nI agree, use this \"flaw\" to send disinformation, show no troops when there are really some there, show troops where there are none, let them watch as the missle is dropping on their location. \"Stage\" an \"attack\" on a location just to see who comes running out. I think there are many mind games that this can but of use!\n\ni don't think you'd be able to fake an attack using the video feed. first you'd have to know someone's watching, which isn't possible since this is probably a broadcast satellite signal and not some sort of intercepted \"laser feed\" coming directly from the drone. second, if the video shows 100 combat troops about to break the door down, and there isn't anyone outside or anyone making noise for miles around then it would probably be pretty clear that it's fake.\n\nI can believe this article, military intelligence isn't as incredible as you think, and everyone asking why they haven't upgraded, the article tells you. Not worth the money, easier to share information with allies, etc.\nSeen military stupidity in action first hand. Military intelligence was a far rarer sight.\n\nLOL! Well they didnt have the money cause they used it all on the Commanders chair and desk for his office. Being in the military, I know we waste so much money on expensive conference desks and commander office furniture. It's sick to see that go on to me. My job i drive big trucks that were built in the 80's and are falling apart. BUT! they dont have the money to keep them up and safely running. Which makes my job even harder. As long as my commander has a $16,000 desk i guess thats what matters then.\n\nSad to think that we're not willing to spend money to save the lives of the men and women who are defending this country.\n\nThis is just beyond belief. The fact that a bunch of people who live in caves are able to view and get intelligence on video feeds live from Predator drones and such is just incredibly stupid on the part of the military.\n\nIs it so hard to think that if Iran can figure out how to view the video feeds, how about other countries with more \"up to date\" technology like China\/Russia, etc. Not only are they aware exactly of what are capabilities are, they know how we employ them and what the response time is for how quickly we can react to the situation on the ground.\n\nI realize that the Predator was created using \"off the shelf\" parts and such, but come on, using old data networks that are unencrypted??? That's like buying crap online and telling everyone your bank account number and PIN information. Somebody out there is listening and will take advantage of it.\n\nOf all the high tech stuff we've got, and you're telling me our communications lines aren't secure??? Whoever let that slip should be FIRED! All the research and development that costs US taxpayers billions of dollars a year, and you're just giving it away to other countries AND our enemies???\n\nhow many of the people in the above posts who criticized the military for not spending the extra money for better equipment are the same people who crucify the military in other posts under articles about the military devolping new technologies?\n\nSo, they picked up the signal and saw the un-encrypted video feeds. Big deal. Those signals never controled the drones or their weapon systems. Those signals are encripted. The video feed was not encrypted so that it would feed faster - since video feed is data heavy and its worth is rather minimal.\n\nIsn't this the same military that is required (because we demanded it) to go with the job done by the lowest bidder?\nI'm sure that old, outdated hardware encryption and slower data transmission are cheaper than a whole new code, hardware, and software system.\n\nTo the rock that said just to upgrade the software, its quite a bit harder than installing your wireless router. Software encoding requires a lot of processing power. Hardware encoding is purpose built and has the capacity to encode and transmit in near real time.\n\nTo the under achiever who drives a truck, A commander has much more value than some slugs who's crowning achievement is being able turn a steering wheel. Why dont you go back to school so you can be a commander with a fancy desk?\n\nThis is a bit of a shame isn't it. Surprising that the most advanced military force in the world relied on outdated encryption for crucial data transfers. More surprising though, is that they knew the importance of data encryption right from the start when remote operation of unmanned vehicles are conceptualised, yet did nothing about it. But I guess this is what happens when military funding is on a tight leash all the time. Lesson learnt better now than later, I guess.\n\nDid anyone even read the article? In no way are they able to take control of the drone. They simply get to watch the video feed of their friends being blown up.\n\nOne of the main reasons the network is not as secure as it could be is that most NATO allies do not have the same military budget that the US does, in order to communicate effectively with our allies our technology level must be lowered.\n\nIt's like running with a friend who is not in great shape. You have to go slower so they can keep up.\n\n@GTO. Lack of funds. They need to update their stuff with NEXT GENERATION equipment, or be constantly trying to catch up to the present. So it's either everything into R&D and building that, or everything into just updating stuff from ten years ago that became outdated 9 years, and 364 days ago, with stuff that's already out of date 30 minutes ago, y' know?\n\nI think that people like me and some other people on the website (brainiacs under the age 20) should be helping the government make decisions about what tech we develop. I mean, seriously, our government is still having trouble developing anything more tech savvy then a preditor with encription codes that you could hack with just under $30!\n\nSad, really sad...\n$26 to malfunction or at least disrupt tech that worth quite large amount of bucks...\n\nDudes, just do some minor upgrades and you are free to continue bombing runs.

{"text":"Related topics\n\n\"Threats are more diverse, interconnected and viral than at any time in history. Attacks, which might involve cyber and financial weapons, can be deniable and unattributable,\" he said.\n\nThe question arises, however, what is cyber warfare? What would qualify as a cyberattack and trigger retaliation? The problem is that cyber weapons can disrupt a country without physical destruction and from half-way around the world, without one soldier firing a shot or a building being destroyed.\n\nFor example, a country could be left disrupted and temporarily impoverished by erased banking records. Transportation systems could result in all flights being grounded, as they were during 9\/11. Many people still remember the days it took to untangle all flights and get both passengers and planes back on schedule. Planes were in the air by the next day but imagine if all airlines were grounded for days on end including mail, cargo and transport flights,\n\nSome say that an attack that qualifies of cyber warfare must, therefore, occur in the political and strategic context of warfare.\n\nCompelling and subduing the enemy does not need to involve physical destruction in this day of cyber attacks and cyber warfare. Cyber sabotage has already been documented by the NY Times and other media systems.\n\nThe problem remains, what is an act of cyber warfare? Cyber warfare cannot be the fallback term for every malicious attack or unpleasant event.\n\nWhile Kaspersky Lab CEO Eugene Kaspersky limits his definition of cyber warfare to activity that uses cyber weapons to cause physical damage, only Stuxnet fits that definition to date. President Obama last fall signed a classified directive that requires an \"imminent\" or ongoing threat of an attack that could result in death or damage to national security before a military cyber-action can be taken to thwart it.\n\nBut the definition of \"imminent\" is, like the definition of an \"act of war,\" subjective and dependent upon circumstances. In cyberspace, where attacks can launch in milliseconds, a nation might not have enough time to detect an attack and mount a defense. In fact, the last clear \"window of opportunity\" to counter a threat may be hours or days or months before it is launched."}

(If you haven't seen this movie, stop now. The rest of this is spoilers.)\n\nIn that same scene is a bunch of incoherent drivel written in gratuitously and purposefully bad English grammar, which reminded me of almost every lamer and script kiddie I've run into.

This is obviously intended as a relation to the fiasco regarding the grading system in the New York Public School System in the late 1980s.\n\nMeanwhile, the head Secret Service guy, Richard Gill (he's a dick, get it?), is busy trying to get every bit of media attention he can. He doesn't know anything about computers, but tries to act like he's very clueful when confronted by a reporter. He rattles off the same speech again and again, every time the media interviews him. The media, of course, swallows it up without question. Sounds like the real U.S. Government and media.\n\nThe writer also made it a point to note that when the U.S. Government suspects someone, even if they don't charge them, they take their equipment and basically destroy it. You may or may not get it back later, but when you do, it's been gutted, wrecked, and probably has D.A.R.E. stickers all over it.\n\nOf course, the movie was undoubtably cheezy. I'd like to see a movie which slams the government, slams the average clueless idiot, and so on. Unfortunately, that wouldn't sell, so it will never be done.\n\nNevertheless, Hackers is a blatently hilarious movie that I highly recommend for those of us who have a clue. The clueless might watch it and be entertained, but the majority of the jokes and metaphors require a clue to recognize. That assumes that I'm not watching some blatently horrible film where the writer just happened to get lucky. I think it's more likely that either the writer was trying to make a point, or they had a technical consultant who took them for a ride.\n\nThe music isn't that bad either. I just wish I could find the song they were using in the movie trailers\/promotions. I can think of a few fun things to do with it, a few other parts, and a video editor. And the soundtrack unfortunately didn't include all the songs in the movie, such as Grand Central Station which is the theme during the last part of the credits and during the hack of the Gibson."}

However, that threshold usually puts you at the bottom of a very long list, usually eliciting an interview, some questions, they take the logs, details, etc and forward it to their computer squad. Defacements\/hacks of a single site, the fact that the hacker wasn't in the USA and probably hacked your site from a compromised machine makes it much more difficult to track down unless that host is willing to log\/capture data and hand it over.\n\nYou can try posting details to  or contacting your local FBI office. Archive the logs, any modified files, etc and burn it to a CD\/DVD so that you can hand it over. The more analysis you hand over with your report the better, but, don't get your hopes up for them actually doing much to catch a hacker that is most likely outside the USA.\n\nYou've got an IP address, but that doesn't mean that the person who (legitimately) had the IP address at that time is the person responsible for the attack on your site? How do you know the system using that IP hadn't been compromised? For all you know, the legitimate user of that IP address may also be (and probably is) a victim?\n\nAt the end of the day, if you have an insecure system, it is inevitable that this will happen. If you aren't 100% sure your system is secure, don't publicly expose it to the internet.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I'm not defending the malicious person who did this, on the contrary, they should be punished to the full extent that the law allows, and I definitely do sympathise with your situation, but I believe your time would be better spent learning how they got in to your system and ensuring it can't happen again, rather than starting a finger pointing exercise, which will almost certainly be fruitless.\n\nEdit: Just saw the answer from @JamesRyan, who should have got the accepted answer to this question IMHO.\n\nThanks Bryan, but the question wasn't why should I do?

The hack means he can access sensitive data and algorithms locked away in the chip's digital vault and even make counterfeit clones that could fool the many devices that rely on it.\n\n\"I can get inside this chip without killing it and I can get through all the security countermeasures it has in place, physical and in software,\" Tarnovsky, who is principal engineer for Flylogic, told The Register in an interview that covered many of the behind-the-scenes elements of the hack.\n\nIts genesis came when Tarnovsky learned that manufacturers of video game controllers had to obtain a license from Microsoft for the peripherals to work on the Xbox 360. The requirement offended his sense of fair play, so he put his reverse engineering muscle to breaking it.\n\n\"I was very surprised they would put a security chip in a wired controller, as well as a wireless controller,\" he said. \"It's very monopolistic what they've done. They have a right to do it, but I have a right to break it too.\"\n\nAfter dissecting a controller, he found that the chip that allowed it to communicate with the Xbox was made by Infineon. He eventually purchased dozens of related microcontrollers on the Hong Kong surplus market for 15 cents apiece.\n\nHe then employed an electron microscope called a focused ion beam workstation (price tag $250,000 used) that allowed him to view the chip in the nanometer scale so he could manipulate its individual wires using microscopic needles.\n\nIt took Tarnovsky four months to develop techniques for probing the chip and another two months to apply them to breaking the 66PE.\n\nWhat he found was a chip that was locked down with multiple levels of defenses. Optical sensors, for instance, were designed to detect ambient light from luminous sources. And a wire mesh that covered the microcontroller was aimed at disabling the chip should any of its electrical circuits be disturbed.\n\n\"One wrong move and I vaporize a track on the chip,\" Tarnovsky said.\n\nIndeed, some 50 of the chips were vaporized in the course of the hack. But over time, he learned how to use the needles to penetrate the chip's inner recesses so he could tap sensitive data that remains unencrypted so it can be processed.\n\nUsing the tungsten as microscopic bridges, Tarnovsky said, he can digitally clone chips used to prevent piracy of satellite TV service, to disable unauthorized cartridges in printers - or to make Xbox game controllers.\n\n\"You could counterfeit this chip,\" he said, although he stressed he had no plans to use the hack for illegal purposes.\n\nIn a statement sent to Infineon customers last week, the company noted the time and expense required for Tarnovsky to crack the chip. But the company went on to say it was a sign of attacks to come and said engineers were already working on a more secure successor to the 66PE.\n\n\"In contrast to conventional solutions, the SLE 78 family now utilizes encryption even in the CPU itself, leaving no plaintext for the attacker,\" the release stated. \"Technical advances of that scale are only possible if the CPU itself is designed 'from the scratch' by the hardware manufacturer with security in mind, right from the beginning.\"\n\nThe physical attack on the 66PE is similar to hacks cryptographers have recently waged on proprietary encryption algorithms in cordless phones and the world's most popular smartcard. In all of them, the secret formula was lifted after sanding down the chips' silicon and examining its circuitry using an electron or optical microscope.\n\n\"More and more things are moving to hardware, and as things move to hardware, people are analyzing these devices and getting the algorithms out and putting them back in the software,\" Tarnovsky said.\n\nWhile the risks of physical attacks are in many cases inevitable, he said the cracking of the 66PE was aided by its abundant supply on international surplus markets, which is something Infineon may want to consider as it readies its new generation of ultra-secure microcontrollers.\n\n\"If this is supposed to be such a secure device and it's common-criteria certified, why are they available on the used surplus market?\" he said. \"This device should not have been readily available for a researcher like me.\" \u00ae\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nSecurity everywhere?\n\nIs this level of security really required everywhere. To stop cloned ink cartridges just so that the printer manufacturer can charge prices higher than gold for replacement ones? Why not try a different business model, one where you get money for adding value rather than fleecing your customers."}

{"text":"According to the White House, no data was accessed or stolen from classified networks\n\nThe White House announced that it had been the victim of a cyber attack, but the hackers didn't get away with any valuable information.\n\nAccording to a report from Politico, the attack was geared toward a White House Military Office computer system. However, the White House said that the attack was isolated and that it affected an \"unclassified network,\" so no data was stolen.\n\nIt was confirmed that the hackers were from China, and that the method for the attack was \"spear phishing.\" This means that the hackers sent an email that contained links or download attachments that were labeled with important tags or phrases to lure in the reader. However, once they click on the links or download the attachment, malware is released into the computer system.\n\nJust last month, it was announced that the White House is working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and others to create an executive order to counter cyber security threats. However, many argue that an executive order isn't good enough -- they say cyber security legislation is necessary because it can offer greater consequences for hackers, give the DHS funding for cyber security workers, etc.\n\nquote: While that is true, here is a nice Graph for you to look at.I support neither Dems\/Repubs,(as I'm not American), but the BS coming from both sides pisses me off.\n\nYou linked to a biased article that attempts to pin the blame for the current economic problems on Bush...you don't have to be American to be a socialist...lol...a bit of irony in my last statement.\n\nquote: Again, the 75% is only above \u20ac800,000.

How much is the deficit under Obama? $16 trillion and counting. Obama added more to the deficit than almost all of the preceding presidents in total.\n\nRomney's plan to lower tax rates for the middle class, reduce loopholes and eliminate deductions can stimulate economic growth, get more people working and even though they are individually paying less in taxes each year, the higher number of taxpayers provides a net gain in tax revenue. Cuts need to be made as well and I you can rest assured that the left is not going to be making the necessary cuts.\n\nquote: Again, another softball :- here you go.\n\nAccording to this chart, and there are no citations or explanations of methodology used to indicate how the arrived at these figures or who was actually paying these rates, things got a lot better after Reagan cut the tax rate in 1981.\n\nThis was over 30 years ago, not recently, and in the 70s and early 80s the economy in America was nearly as bad as it is today, if not worse in some ways...so you're essentially making my point for me - higher taxes, especially ones targeted at successful businesses and individuals, have a detrimental effect on then economy.\n\nquote: Social seems to be a dirty word in America.\n\nNo, but it is often misrepresented by the lefties. When they start talking about \"social justice\" it's code for \"we want the government to give us more stuff\".\n\nquote: As I stated in a previous post, the best countries are a mix of Capitalism and Social programs.\n\nSocial programs are one thing; socialist policies and big, bloated government is another.

Officials say that a cyberattack that results in death, injury or significant destruction, triggers the country's right to self-defense.\n\nThis means that if a cyberattack causes a nuclear plant meltdown, affects air-traffic systems to the point where planes crash, or opens a dam above a populated area, the US would see it as an illegal use of force that's subject to international laws of war, the Washington Post informs.\n\nHarold Koh, the legal adviser of the Department of State, told an audience at a conference hosted by US Cyber Command at Fort Meade that although countries such as China didn't agree, United Nations member states established a series of principles.

{"text":"Advanced persistent threats: What you need to know\n\nContinuing Computerworld Australia's recent series examining security threats, this week we talk to experts about the problem of advanced persistent threats (APTs).\n\nAn APT, according to Symantec, is a cyber attack targeted at an organisation to steal data, especially intellectual property.\n\nFor example, US security vendor RSA was targeted by an APT in March 2011 from an undisclosed nation state which took all the information stored on its SecurID tokens.\n\nThese tokens are used on personal computers, USB devices and phones within companies to provide an extra layer of security beyond a username and password for people logging into programs or networks.\n\nThe information taken from RSA was used in an attempt to infiltrate US defence contractor, Lockheed Martin. The defence contractor was forced to pull access to its private virtual access network after hackers compromised the SecurID token technology.\n\nAccording to Gartner US research director, Lawrence Pingree, an APT can take any electronic information from an infected computer.\nFor example, the APT might be used for intellectual property leakage, credential gathering, destruction of data or even to manipulate industrial control systems.\n\n\"It basically depends on what the breached system's function is within a corporation or government,\" he says.\n\nPrime targets for APT attacks include government departments, government contractors ,such as research and development organisations, and financial services entities because these organisations often contain the most attractive data says Pingree.\n\"This data includes fraud, intelligence and intellectual property,\" he says.\n\nHowever, he warns that more organisations face the threat of an APT as people become more reliant on computer resources.\n\"Hacktivists change this game considerably since they don't choose based on target data so much as their politics and ideals,\" Pingree says.\n\nAddressing APTs\n\nMore than a year on from the APT which led to the worldwide replacement of SecurID tokens, RSA Australia and New Zealand general manager, Shaun McLagan, says the company learnt a number of lessons from the attack including the importance of having an incident response capability and security plans that are documented and tested.\n\n\"Companies need to make sure that security is addressed all the way up to the board level and continues to evolve,\" he says. \"Vigilance on identifying key assets and protecting those [assets] is critically important.\"\n\nAccording to McLagan, RSA's A\/NZ customers are more willing to discuss the threat of compromises following the APT incident.\n\n\"The idea that there is a network with a perimeter has gone,\" he says. \"Now that customers are trying to deal with these APTS, they are looking for guidelines.\"\nFor example, McLagan says companies should educate users within the business, find out what best security practices can be applied and the level of support needed to help create a risk management strategy.\n\n\"This strategy should be risk based, contextual and agile,\" he says.\n\nGartner's Pingree adds that APTs require an advanced persistent security program to address the threats.\n\n\"What this means is running a security program where you continually evaluate the security technology you have deployed and make sure it is enforced and updated to the latest technological advancements,\" he says.\n\n\"Technologies are being changed to address the latest threats, so organisations need to adopt this technology and strategy to remain effective against the adversary.\""}

{"text":"Schneier on Security\n\nMarch 31, 2006\n\niJacking\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Guardian is reporting on a new crime: people who grab laptops out of their owners' hands and then run away. It's called \"iJacking,\" and there seems to be a wave of this type of crime at Internet cafes in San Francisco:\n\nIn 2004 the SFPD Robbery Division recorded 17 strong-arm laptop robberies citywide. This increased to 30 cases in 2005, a total that doesn't even include thefts that fall under the category of \"burglary,\" when a victim isn't present. (SFPD could not provide statistics on the number of laptop burglaries.)\n\nIn the past three months alone, Park Station, the police precinct that includes the Western Addition, has reported 11 strong-arm laptop robberies, a statistic that suggests this one district may exceed last year's citywide total by the end of 2006.\n\nSome stories:\n\nMaloney was absorbed in his work when suddenly a hooded person yanked the laptop from Maloney's hands and ran out the door. Maloney tried to grab his computer, but he stumbled across a few chairs and landed on the floor as the perpetrator dashed to a vehicle waiting a quarter block away.\n\n[...]\n\nTwo weeks before Maloney's robbery, on a Sunday afternoon, a man had been followed out of the Starbucks on the corner of Fulton Street and Masonic Avenue and was assaulted by two suspects in broad daylight. According to the police report, the suspects dragged the victim 15 feet along the pavement, kicking him in the face before stealing his computer.\n\nIn early February a women had her laptop snatched while sitting in Ali's Caf\u00e9. She pursued the perpetrator out the door, only to be blindsided by a second accomplice. Ali described the assault as \"a football tackle\" so severe it left the victim's eyeglasses in the branches of a nearby tree. In the most recent laptop robbery, on March 16 in a caf\u00e9 on the 900 block of Valencia Street, police say the victim was actually stabbed.\n\nIt's obvious why these thefts are occurring. Laptops are valuable, easy to steal, and easy to fence. If we want to \"solve\" this problem, we need to modify at least one of those characteristics. Some Internet cafes are providing locking cables for their patrons, in an attempt to make them harder to steal. But that will only mean that the muggers will follow their victims out of the cafes. Laptops will become less valuable over time, but that really isn't a good solution. The only thing left is to make them harder to fence.\n\nThis isn't an easy problem. There are a bunch of companies that make solutions that help people recover stolen laptops. There are programs that \"phone home\" if a laptop is stolen. There are programs that hide a serial number on the hard drive somewhere. There are non-removable tags users can affix to their computers with ID information. But until this kind of thing becomes common, the crimes will continue.\n\nInteresting quandary--company laptops aren't such a problem for the individual, since they're easily replaced with a police report. But I suspect most laptops stolen from Starbucks are personal possessions on which the user is writing their novel or the next killer app. BIOS passwords and encrypted hard disks don't get your manuscript back.\n\nSo instead, you use a collaborative online word processor (I know of one amateur novelist who writes them as drafts in gmail), keeping your data on someone else's server where the company can shut down, be hacked, or suddenly lock you out of your free account unless you subscribe.\n\nPick your poison: theft by thug, or theft by dodgy startup. Which one are you willing to risk?\n\nI would like to see an epoxy-bonded large and conspicuous lexan film provided with the laptop. Apply one coat to the underside, stick a photo of yourself and a card with contact information, apply a second coat and stick the lexan tag with laptop serial number. Once cured, good luck removing it with anything else then a power sander.\n\nHaving hard disk encryption won't work if the perp snatches the laptop out from under your fingers while you are logged in. Most hard disk encryption only actually \"works\" when the computer is fully shutdown.\n\nLaptop encryption won't make a difference. Ithink the standard MO is to wipe the disk and sell it on ebay\/craigslist. There was a big fence of the kind busted here in the bay area a few months back.\n\nAlso, I think from that incident it was shown how there is at least two layers: the thieves and those who recondition\/sell the stolen laptops.\n\nAlso, they don't bother with the power supply. My dad had someone walk into his industrial building and steel his laptop off his desk. They didn't bother with the power supply or anything else, just grabbed the notebook and the camera.\n\nThe annoying thing about getting indelible identifying tags accepted is that they're a cost to the consumer, but little percieved benefit - an individual's laptop isn't less likely to be stolen because it has a tag, because the thief won't know that until he's already stolen it. Only with wide use does it become a practical technology.\n\nIsn't it quite possible to make laptops harder to fence as it is by filing a police report and sending the laptop's serial number to local pawn shops, though?\n\nThis isn't all that new. I (almost) had something similar happen in Cleveland in 1999. I was riding the light rail to the airport, and reading The Onion on my Palm III. The train stopped, and a thug made a grab for the device. Fortunately, that model had a plastic face cover that came off easily, and the thug grabbed that, which separated from the device itself. He tossed it back into the train as the doors closed, not having any use for a worthless piece of plastic.\n\nAs for the data-loss thing, the solution is the same as always: backups. Honestly, it's stupid to keep important data only on a laptop. Laptop hard disks are extremely failure-prone.\n\nI worried about this sort of thing ever since I started doing occasional work outdoors by a scenic pond (functionally equivalent to a mugger, as far as the laptop is concerned). So I bought a security cable from a local computer store and loop it through a belt-loop. Now the laptop can't fall far from my lap. I imagine that would inconvenience a thief as well.\n\nI recall hearing about a european community that had an interesting solution to bicycle theft. They bought a whole lot of bicycles and left them about for public transportation. Sure you could steal them, but no one has any reason to buy them.\n\nSo one end solution would be truly ubiquitous computing. But that doesn't address the current problem.\n\nDell used to sell about 50 different color cover plates and wrist rests for some of their Inspiron models. I had the very bright yellow ones. That, plus a couple of stickers that my younger daughter decided I needed affixed to the top cover made my old laptop pretty distinctive. My new one, though, is a plain black ThinkPad. Maybe my daughter will give it a paint job.\n\n\"Theft is deterred when the profit isn't worth the risk. Maybe forcing a case switch would do it. Maybe.\"\n\nRemember: You don't have to outrun the bear, you just have to outrun the people you're with.\n\nYou don't have to make your laptop unprofitable steal, you just have to make it less profitable than someone else's laptop. I would think a beat-up-looking of custom-painted or otherwise weird laptop would be less of a target. It's a good idea.\n\n\"Having hard disk encryption won't work if the perp snatches the laptop out from under your fingers while you are logged in. Most hard disk encryption only actually 'works' when the computer is fully shutdown.\"\n\nThis isn't about the data. It's about the physical machine. Hard drive encryption doesn't matter, unless it renders the machine unusable. And even that won't help until enough of us use it so that the thief no longer believes he can steal a resellable product.\n\nEasy solution: after you get your laptop set up on the table, set a 9mm down beside it. Now that's a deterrent.\n\nSeriously, though, the solution is to take the same steps you'd take to prevent any other mugging: Sit with your back to the wall, away from the door. Pay attention to your surroundings. When you leave, put the laptop in a carry case and sling it over your head. And learn a martial art (also useful against those terrorists with the sharpened credit cards!) Better yet, leave the laptop at home with the rest of your valuables, and get the coffee to go....\n\nI have a BIOS password and a HD password. This computer would be nearly impossible to operate withoug going back to IBM for a BIOS reflash.\n\nThe only missing piece of the puzzle is a way you can submit the computer's serial number with the police report so that the laptop manufacturers would call the police if the machine shows up in a lab.\n\nOr maybe there are gray-market companies that would reflash a laptop for you - for a fee, no questions asked...\n\nThat is one of the reasons I thought that the idea of giving students (around here they wanted to start with 4th graders!) laptops to carry back and forth to school was ridiculous. Why give a kid a $1000 target for thieves? You'd never let a child wear a diamond necklace worth that much.\n\nyou're right - to solve it you need to make the theft economically unviable which is difficult because laptops are expensive and portable. the \"phone home\" technology you mentioned for recovering stolen laptops is effective. i ran a live field test and wrote up the results in an article for Law Office Computing and they allowed me to republish on my blog here-> \n\nthere's a couple companies that offer the service and the one I ended up using will guarantee each protected machine up to $1k if they can't recover it in 60 days. the real cost is the data both from a loss standpoint as well as being comprimised. mitigate those two things via a periodic automated backup along w\/ running an encrypted HD and you've done the best you can short of handcuffing it to your wrist when you're in public.\n\nIf everyone set their hardware passwords so that the machine would not boot with out it, thefts would stop. It used to be that you could reset them with a wire from one pin on the parrell port to another (for one example I know of), but now pretty much have to send it to the maker to have done (or so I found a few years ago trying to get a machine bought at auction going).\n\nIf you cannot boot, you cannot sell the machine, and people will stop stealing them (I doubt the parts market will be enough to keep thefts going).\n\nApparently, any solution would have to be implemented in hardware and couldn't have an integral override. Don't some car radios have a device in them that renders them useless if they're stolen? Is that effective? What if the user had to type a password to boot the computer? Then if he was unable to enter that password, the laptop would have to be reactivated with a device he kept at home, or the IT department kept under lock and key.\n\nAs an employee for a Very Large Financial Institution, corporate policy requires me to lock down my laptop at all times...\n\n... which speaks to another potential motive for this: data theft.\n\nMy employer's default OS build for laptops also includes hard disk encryption, so that even if the laptop is stolen, the potentially sensitive data on it\/access afforded it (think \"steal credit card numbers\") can not be. But that model falls flat on its face if it's taken out of my hands, while not screen-locked and data is stolen switching the laptop off.\n\nThings get even more scary if I was connected to the VPN at the time. (I do backups. For many things. Including customer data.)\n\n- Computers you truly can't use unless you're the owner. No cheap hacks around the security like working around the CMOS password, swapping out the harddrive, etc. Hard, because you don't want failure modes where the laptop becomes useless as a brick to its rightful owner.\n\n- Computers that are physically identifiable -- engraved S\/N, cases that make it evident you opened them.\n\nWho would invest in stuff like that? Individuals can get inconspicuous backpacks, locks, or neon blue paint, and just generally be careful (outrun their fellow campers but not the bear). Maybe corporations that lose a lot to theft? Insurers who can't force their policyholders to follow good security practice, but can charge lower premiums to insure computers with certain features?\n\nMore scary ideas:\n\n- MAC or CPUID snooping. Widely distributed programs would grab a MAC (or CPUID if there was one), then check on the Internet to see whether the computer was listed somewhere as stolen, with users able to opt out of the check. Even if you wipe the hard drive clean, if someone later installs snoopy software and the software has unimpeded access to the IDs, stolen computers would be found. Scary for privacy, but not as scary as this:\n\n- Computers that prove their identity over the network. Like, an RSA key buried in hardware, inaccessible to software, and signed by AMD\/Intel. You'd have to prove your identity to, say, buy DRMed music online, at which time the sellers would check whether your computer was stolen. Unrelated to the law-enforcement potential, the RIAA would love it, even though -- or maybe precisely because -- it sounds like something out of the Book of Revelation.\n\nWhy not stick a GPS unit inside the laptop that communicates via the cellphone network?\n\nWhen your laptop is stolen you call special number and enter your code, a signal is then sent to the laptop to call the police and start broadcasting it's location. Within 5 minutes of having it stolen your laptop is now a flashing beacon giving its location (and well as the location of the thief) to the cops.\n\nIn addition to possibly getting you back your laptop it makes laptop thiefs extremely paranoid once they find out this can happen. I have two concerns though, one is the size and power requirements of this device though I figure they can put GPS in cellphones so the whole system can't be too bad. The bigger risk is the thiefs carrying around a GPS or cell phone jammer which kinda makes this system useless.\n\nThe problem with most of the given solutions is that they aren't obvious to the attacker. Sure, they don't get their money, but you don't keep your laptop. They're only useful if they become ubiquitious.\nInstead, apply a sticker, hopefully made like \"waranty void\" stickers, that says \"this laptop protected by Impressive Sounding, Inc\". Put it on the \/top\/ of the case, where it's nice and visible. The attackers rip off the guy at the next table, who they figure will be less risk.\nAlternatively, add some duct tape to your machine. The attackers will rip off one that appears to have higher value.\nTrackers are nice for recovery, but it's a lot cheaper and better to be a less attractive target.\n\nsan francisco is the city that just voted to prohibit law-abiding citizens from owning guns.\nthey brought this on themselves, as far as i'm concerned.\njust come up to oregon and try to snatch my laptop. i would be amused.\n\nSlap a coat of latex house paint on it.\nCover it with stickers and paint over them.\nScratch it up to give it a junked look.\nIf you want the mil-spec job, camo it in drab greens and tans. For the stealth look, use some flat black and stencil some numbers on it. It may look totally unfit for resale, but that's the whole point.\n\nHow about combining a lock with a 120 dB alarm built-in to the laptop? Locking the laptop to a belt hoop or something similar arms the system. Unlocking with the correct key disarms it. If the laptop is forcibly removed while locked, the alarm goes off and keeps on howling until it is unlocked. (This would not prevent thieves who threaten people to unlock their laptops first though.)\n\nSo, I go go to the 3rd Annual Nigerian EMail Conference. We're out at the cyberdisco partying with some geeks from Hong Kong. Then what happens? Four guys in a Toyota pickup with a machine gun mounted in bed show up as we were leaving to go back to the hotel. They just wanted our laptops. They looked at mine and said keep that one, we can't use it. Everyone laughed at my ugly laptop. I had the last laugh at the conference this year.\n\nSan Francisco is a very technology oriented city, with a lot of .com's competing in a highly profitable and cut-throat field.\n\nCould someone steal a competetiors laptops from their CIO when he stops at Starbucks for lunch? Grab it while they're using it and you've bypassed all the disk-encryption and BIOS passwords in the world. Also avoids tedious hacking of their network.\n\nPlug in an external USB hard drive and copy all files over for later analysis, ditching the laptop in the bay.\n\nSure, most of them are just criminals stealing high-value items for quick cash gain, but there could be alternate reasons for a few.\n\nI would have thought the easiest and most sure-fire way to disable a stolen laptop permenantly would be to include in the hardware a pager that would kill the machine after receiving a kill-code. If the laptop is stolen, the manufacturer starts paging it's kill code every hour for a day, every day for a month, every week for a year.\n\nI have seen a product that attaches to luggage or a briefcase, with another piece that you carry. Then, when you get a certain distance from the bag, the device you are carrying sounds an alarm.\n\nWhat if the alarm-sounding piece is loud and attached to your laptop, and the other piece is in your pocket? Now, when some thug steals your laptop, it starts making a God-awful noise when they get about 20 feet away from you. Should make for a fun get-away in a small car...especially if you can get the alarm to be about 120 db...\n\nEncrypting the data might not prevent the theft, but to me, it is all about the data. Keeping the bad guys out of my data, and having a backup of it so I retain it, is more important than the replacement cost of the hardware.\n\nStill, your point is well taken, and I'll be shopping for a bumper sticker this afternoon.\n\nif you don't want your laptop (or bicycle, car, firearm, cell phone, purse, wallet, or any other personal item) stolen: do two things.\n\n1) don't make yourself a target. up the hill in pacific heights or in the marina, you're a little safer than western addition. don't flash your laptop or other high priced item in public. put your laptop in a shitty cheap backpack instead of a fancy leather laptop case. i used to carry around two phones... a high priced one that i could flash around in the marina... and a cheap custom covered throwaway phone for use in the mission. now i just use my pdaphone and rarely flash it. it's insured against theft for $5 per month. my very expensive laptop is left at home or in the car, where rent or car insurance cover theft costs.\n\n2) pursue robbers. work hard to find or stress the importance of your lost device. if you are a witness to a robbery, observe things in detail. provide a report to law enforcement. help out if you can, safety permitting. note that a firearm does not make you safer, 90% of robberies where the victim has a firearm - the assaliant ends up neither hurt nor dead - but instead ends up stealing the victim's firearm right out of his\/her hands. many firearms are stolen from homes and cars. but yet people don't report these thefts (like bicycles). even when they do report them, they don't have permits or records of purchase. law enforcement needs many details to properly track down criminals who commit burglary or robbery. even if they can't find your stolen property, they have the data. that data can aid in crime prevention. it can later put your assaliant behind bars, or into a program to aid in kleptomania, or other mental health and life issues. over 80% of all crimes are comitted under the influence of drugs or alcohol. many are addicts and steal to get money to buy drugs. education of safe and kind drug use, and not abuse, will also aid in prevention of these and other types of crime.\n\nLaptops are disposable. Just make sure you're insured and who cares if someone steals it: assuming you're both encrypting your hard drive and backing up, you won't lose much and they won't gain much... in fact, you'll be able to get a free upgrade after you get your insurance claim.\nThese are just the car stereos of this decade.\n\nWhy not paint it green, add a plastic fake hand crank and maybe a name brand logo sticker or two removed from a well known toy product and a custom small sticker on the back which says something like: approximate retail value: $39.99.\n\nEven better: Why not convince government(s) to sell the $100 laptop in the future to people?\n\nAlso: people should try using Linux LiveCDs more often when on the go.\n\nThe problem with all the solutions that make the laptop less resellable is that they make the laptop less resellable. This decreases its value to the owner as well as to any potential thief. So it becomes a question of weighing the potential loss to theft against the sure loss of the laptop's resale value.\n\nAs with bikes, the only solution that works is the trashmo one - have a shitty looking bike to lock up when you are in town, and only ride the good ones when you're not going to be leaving them unattended for long. A similar and nearly as good solution is to ride something odd and hard to sell, but that doesn't always work (I've had a blatantly unique bike stolen and never seen again).\n\nThe \"security label\" solution can work, but it's not very reliable. Few people bother to check that the laptop hasn't been reported stolen even if the serial number is intact (I have severely embarassed one retailer this way). The idea that they'll ring a number on the laptop at their own expense in order to find out if they're about to offer a criminal cash just seems ... unlikely. Even if it works, you will find out that the plod have your laptop and it's now owned by your insurer. Useful.\n\nJust a small note for the people who are encrypting their IDE hard disk by the standard IDE password\/encryption method.\nNOT speaking here of people encrypting partitions - that is another problem.\nYou should check that your IDE disks are frozen (by the IDE freeze disk command) after you have left the BIOS and started your operating system. It seems obvious, but some BIOS forget to freeze the IDE disks password, so anybody stealing your laptop when it is powered on, can just put a new password, or disable the password subsystem, before powering off (these commands does not need to have the old password - just the disk unlocked).\n\nIf you do not know what I am talking about, either read the IDE specs, or forget about this comment.\n\nI'm sure I've read about proximity locks, using Bluetooth or similar. If my laptop shut itself down when it moved out of range of my person (or at least something on my person such as a keyfob), I'd be pretty happy (from the perspective of BIOS passwords or disk encryption). If it also triggered a very loud alarm, I'd be even happier.\n\nWhat if every CPU had a serial number that could not be change, and every month Microsoft included a check for stolen laptops as part of windows update, so that just stop working if you installed the windows update.\n\nWhat it worked if only 20% of CPUs had this serial number?\n\nWhat if 5% of laptops had built in tracking devices and you could not tell from the outside of the laptop if it had a tracking device?\n\nWhat if Dell made having a tracking device fitted to a laptop a \"no cost\ufffd\ufffd? option, so that people that did not mind being tracked could have one? Would the fat that no one wanted to steal Dell laptops put up the price that EVERONE was willing to pay for a Del laptop enough to cover the cost?\n\nHow match as a lap top owner are you willing to pay me, to have a tracking device in my lap top, so as to make it more risk for someone to steal your laptop (they don't know if it has a tracking device after all)\n\n@Ian Ringrose:\nThe Pentium III in fact *had* a serial number, readable by software - it was\/is usually disabled for privacy concerns.\nI have no idea about the more recent CPUs, though TPM will have similar (and vastly expanded) capabilities to identify the PC again.\n\nA few weeks ago I was typing on my notebook (has a sleek aluminium case) in the train, on a seat near the doors. Train stopped, a young man came in through the door and tried to grab it off my lap.\n\nI somehow felt alarmed a split second before, so I held it firmly and we both pulled at it until someone else from behind pulled my arms off, so the thief could run outside with it. I followed him, grabbed his jacket, we both fell and the struggle continued on the platform.\n\nFinally three men ran away, but they dropped my 'book on the floor. It is still completely functional (I guess the motion sensor switched the harddisk to a safe state), but the case is heavily scratched. I left it so as it looks less attracting.\n\nNobody had helped me, the numerous surveillance cameras had not captured anything, and the police never found the guys.\n\nI use AES homedir-encryption, the screenlock kicks in after two minutes, and I regularly backup my data with rsync to a server. But still I feel lucky that I don't need to buy and configure a new notebook.\n\nI now use USB pendrives to make backups on the way too. I thought about locking the 'book to my belt or the seat, but that is probably too inconvenient in practice, and I am not sure if it might provoke even more violence.\n\nI wish there was an option that the motion sensor trigger the screenlock. Maybe one could build alarms and other countermeasures on that.\n\nlaptop tags don't work. The only way to get your laptop back is to use a laptop tracking device like lojack for laptops. ( Even the whole epoxy thing explained above, while interesting is not really going to help you. If your laptop gets stolen the tracking software can be used to find the machine and bust the crook. A friend of mine bought it for her son when he went to school and lucky for him cause when the notebook got stolen from his dorm it was the only thing that got it back for him.\n\nIt is obviously because San Fransisco Banned Handguns completely. Even before then you probably couldn't carry them legally. Also all the other crazy laws in california that make it impossible to defend yourself.\n\nI mean a criminal can be almost 100% sure that the person he grabs the laptop from won't be armed and won't fight back most likely.\n\nThe criminal doesn't care about the law and might carry a gun anyway. Then he knows he can jack a laptop from a lawabiding citizen with no risk to his life."}
{"text":"On Meeting the Prime Minister\u2026and Online Security\n\nShare this:\n\nA few weeks ago my husband, son and I were strolling through our local shopping mall when we happened to see the prime minister of our country of residence. He was standing in the common area shaking hands and posing for photos with passersby.\n\nWe stopped and I took a photo of my husband and son with him. That done, we proceeded along to the supermarket to do our Saturday grocery shopping.\n\nSome minutes later it hit me. We had just met the prime minister, the most powerful man in Finland. I should have shaken his hand. And why hadn't I gotten in the photo too? The significance of meeting this dignitary had been completely lost on me!\n\nThe thing was, it was so low key. There was no big fuss about it. People were mostly going about their business. There was no heavy security detail, no men in black suits and sunglasses. And the prime minister himself, Jyrki Katainen, had looked so ordinary. Casually dressed, he could have been any other shopper that day.\n\nBut he wasn't any other shopper. He was the head of the Republic of Finland, out campaigning for his party (municipal elections were the following day).\n\nIt was a completely different experience from the other time I saw a head of government. In 1996 President Clinton came through my hometown on his re-election campaign. I remember the excitement. Thousands of people stood thronged around the stage. It took quite a while for my cousins and I to weave our way to the front of the crowd, where a rope separated the mass of people from the president. My cousin, who was bolder than I, stretched out far enough to shake his hand. And you can bet there was security.\n\nThe laid-back encounter with Prime Minister Katainen got me thinking about security in the real world versus the online world. In the real world, the need for security varies depending on the population, economics, social problems, et cetera, of where you are. It's apparently pretty easy for Katainen to get around in this quiet northern country of 5.4 million people. But in many countries with higher populations and less egalitarianism than Finland, top government officials must travel with an elaborate entourage.\n\nIn the online world however, threats are not bound by geography. Hackers use the information superhighway to get them anywhere in the world they want to go, in milliseconds. They can, for example, steal personal data, spread viruses, infiltrate bank accounts, and turn computers into robots that do their bidding, all from the comfort of their own home. So hackers in Wherever-ia aren't just that country's problem \u2013 they're everyone's problem.\n\nComprehensive Internet security is a must, whether you're in a small, relatively safe country like Finland, a populous nation like the USA, or whether you use a Mac or a PC. And wherever, whoever you are, there's protection for you."}

{"text":"Lentis\/Cyberterrorism and Cyberwarfare\n\nIntroduction\n\nCyberterrorism and cyberwarfare involve attacks against information stored on computers and networks with the intention of inflicting harm. With ever-increasing advancements being made in technological fields, acts of cyberterrorism and cyberwarfare are only becoming more prevalent in our world today.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Zimmermann Telegram\n\nZimmermann Telegram\n\nIn January of 1917 during World War I, Britain intercepted and deciphered a telegram, now known as the Zimmermann Telegram, from German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann to the German Minister of Mexico. The Zimmermann Telegram proposed a German-Mexican alliance against the United States, where Mexico would regain lost territory in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. [1]\n\nUp until this point in World War I, the United States had remained fairly neutral. However, the American citizens were outraged when the telegram was portrayed in the press, causing the United States to declare war on Germany on April 6.\n\nWhat is now known as cyberwarfare can be traced all the way back to 1917, when Britain intercepted and decoded a message that not only changed the course of World War I, but also changed the course of history.\n\nThe Creeper\n\nCreeper, the first known computer virus, was written in 1971 by Rob Thomas in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nProgrammers in the 1970's were no different than programmers today in their desire to test their systems and check their code, and that was the intent of Creeper. Once Creeper got into a computer, it produced a message onscreen: \"I'm the Creeper. Catch me if you can!\" Later, the anti-virus program, Reaper, was written to catch Creeper. [2]\n\nAt the time, Creeper wasn't known as a \"virus\", since computer viruses hadn't existed before that point.\n\nModern Cyberthreats\n\nStuxnet\n\n\"\n\n[O]ne of the great technical blockbusters in malware history.\n\n\"\n\n\u2014Vanity Fair, April 2011\n\nThe Stuxnet virus is a computer worm found in 2009 in critical infrastructure software systems around the world. It is known as the most sophisticated computer malware to date. Its target was Iranian Uranium enrichment facilities, and Stuxnet reportedly did damage to two major nuclear facilities in Iran [3]. The United States and Israel are rumored to be responsible for the attack. There is no direct evidence, but diplomatic cables posted on WikiLeaks and other government correspondence support these claims [4]\n\nStuxnet attacked what are called Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. SCADA systems are specialized software to control industrial infrastructure, including nuclear power plants, power grids, train switches, and gas pipelines. These systems are often outdated and not written with security in mind. Further, there is no economic incentive to replace them with more secure software. Doing so would require large costs, heavy planning, and little to no added benefit once completed [5].\n\nOther Attacks\n\nMalware by categories on March 16, 2011.\n\nSCADA attacks are not the only type of cyberthreat today. There are numerous examples of attacks from hacker groups and individuals, all with varying motives. Some are to attack a particular company or corporation, some are to prove the weakness of systems, and some are even practical jokes.\n\nCitibank had over 200,000 accounts compromised, with hackers stealing names, credit card numbers, and email addresses, simply by altering numbers in a URL [6]. Sony had over a million passwords stolen for its PlayStation Network accounts, exploiting a simple web vulnerability. Further, the hacker group responsible for the attack, LulzSec, claimed the passwords were stored unencrypted, or in cleartext form, considered an egregious misuse of handling of private information [7]. The same group, LulzSec, also hacked [[w:Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]'s website and posted a fake story indicating the late rapper Tupac Shakur was still alive. The group took offense to a PBS documentary about the leak of U.S. diplomatic cables posted on the WikiLeaks website [8].\n\nPotential Danger in the Future\n\nThere are many cyberthreats, from ones against critical infrastructure to ones against government and corporate websites. SCADA attacks on critical infrastructure have the most potential for disaster in the future. For example, the United States has extensive missile defense capabilities. But a hacker could hijack our nuclear launch system and launch our own missiles against us, or even take control of a power grid and cause blackouts, chaos, and confusion. In 2007, researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory identified a vulnerability in the power grid. A video of the danger was leaked to CNN, and shows a large diesel generator blowing up in smoke, all from a cyberattack [9].\n\nAs seen above, many companies and software systems today do not take cybersecurity as a serious matter. Many considered the storing of cleartext passwords by Sony to be a violation of security principles and customer's trust of their handling of private information. Many SCADA systems do not take security or hacking into account even at all. Siemens' Simatic WinCC SCADA system used a default password \"hard-coded\" into the software, meaning it was not mutable by the software users. To add, it was posted online in product forums since 2008. The Stuxnet virus exploited a default password weakness to weaken Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities [10].\n\nFacebook\n\nThere are over 800 million active users on Facebook, 75% of whom are located outside the United States and 50% of whom log on to Facebook on any given day. [11] Since Facebook is free to join for anyone with an email account, it is a quick and accessible tool for cyber-terrorists. It has become common for governments and terrorist organizations to monitor Facebook for updates that contain valuable information. By piecing together information from multiple service-members' Facebook accounts, foreign entities are sometimes able to determine schedules, locations, and intended actions of military units. In August 2009, the Marine Corps placed a ban on the use of the unclassified portion of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) for social networking purposes. In March 2010, the United States Marine Corps released a memo which canceled the ban. According to the memo, Marines are allowed \"limited personal use\" of the MCEN but they must \"strictly adhere to sound operational security measures.\" [12]\n\nFacebook provides an electronic interface for much of the world to connect and communicate ideas. This creates an environment where information is virtually endless. File uploads and downloads on Facebook happen nearly constantly. Facebook users upload 250 million photos and install more than 20 million apps every day. The average user has 130 friends. [13] In addition to issues related to the social and psychological effects of Facebook, the endless exchange of information provides numerous opportunities for cyber-attacks and espionage.\n\nWikiLeaks\n\nWikiLeaks is an organization that collects and disperses sensitive or controversial information from anonymous sources around the world. WikiLeaks has released documents revealing corporate, federal, and international secrets in the name of free speech. Spokesperson Julian Assange claims that \"free speech is what regulates government and what regulates law.\" Assange further claims that law and government are derived from the flow of information and that this process is protected under national and international legislation.\n\nWikiLeaks has become a very controversial organization in the last two years. Some social groups believe that WikiLeaks is simply exercising freedom of the press, while others believe they are disrupting national security. On his profile from TED.com, Julian Assange is called \"...one of the world's most visible human-rights activists.\"[14] Julian Assange has stated several times that WikiLeaks will do everything in its power politically, legally, and technologically to protect its sources and that it will attempt to maximize the political impact of its leaked material. This claim has been challenged by many in popular media.\n\nIn one of its most controversial leaks, WikiLeaks posted video of a 2007 Apache Helicopter airstrike. The clip, entitled \"Collateral Murder,\" was decrypted from US Army footage and showed a group of non-combatants, including two Reuters photographers, being fired upon by the Apache's 30-mm cannon. According to Assange, between 18 and 26 people were killed in the attack.[15] In an April 2010 interview with Stephen Colbert, Julian Assange was criticized for having edited the video, omitting certain details (including the fact that some of the men killed had been armed), and entitling the video \"Collateral Murder.\" Colbert claimed that these discrepancies should redefine the leak as an editorial, since they \"...emotional[ly] manipulate\" the public's opinion.[16] Julian Assange countered by claiming that the order to engage was given before the US soldiers properly identified the group.\n\nWikiLeaks has become a well-known entity around the world. The US government has banned its employees from viewing classified documents publicized through WikiLeaks, and it claims WikiLeaks has damaged national security.[17] Still, many groups celebrate and support WikiLeaks. In addition to TED.com, groups such as Anonymous have defended Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.[18]\n\nWikiLeaks has become a major player in the world of cyber-terrorism. It has gained widespread support and equally widespread disdain from people in all social groups. Many view it as a menace, but many find it to be an essential tool for checking the power of corporate and government entities.\n\nRelevant Social Groups\n\nSeveral relevant social groups need to be addressed regarding cyberterrorism and cyberwarfare.\n\nGovernments\n\nGovernments store top secret information in what is thought to be high security places. However, internet attacks are made almost daily. If the wrong person hacks the right information, governments could be in huge trouble. Safety and security is at stake here.\n\nMilitaries\n\nIt's becoming easier and easier for the enemy to find out where military troops are stationed. For example, a simple post on facebook from a soldier to his wife saying \"We'll be in Afghanistan tomorrow, then coming home\" can give away huge amounts of information when pieced with other things that the enemy already knows. This puts our military in very dangerous situations.\n\nPrivate Corporations\n\nPrivate Corporations are extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks. For example, this past June, hackers acquired the personal information of about 360,000 of Citi's credit card holders. Citi notified customers of the breach and began issuing new credit cards to the affected customers. Citi said it has implemented \"enhanced procedures\" to prevent a recurrence of the breach, but didn't elaborate.[19]\n\nOrdinary Citizens\n\nRecently, lots of cyber attacks have been coming out of China. However, these hackers are not associated with the Chinese government or military. They're basically young, male, patriotic Chinese citizens, demonstrating their power and intelligence. Citizens can also be the victims of cyberwarfare, such as having an email account hacked.[20]\n\nHackers\n\nHackers range from genius computer programmers to people who are actually employed by the government to obtain and decode highly classified information. Internet hackers are becoming more prevalent as advancements in technology are being made daily.\n\nConclusion\n\nAn appetite for instant gratification plus ever-expanding technology equals opportunity. Opportunity for good, harm, and everything in between. As advances in technology are being made daily, cyberterrorism and cyberwarfare are becoming increasingly more common in our world today. What our future holds in these regards? Only time will tell."}

{"text":"Cyber Attacks Jump 81 Percent, Target Mobile, Social Networks\n\nThe number of malicious cyber attacks jumped 81 percent in 2011, according to new data from Symantec, with the firm noting a huge leap in mobile breaches, particularly on the Android OS.\n\nSocial networks, meanwhile, are the new frontier for cyber scammers as they move on from spam, which decreased by 20 percent last year.\n\n\"The very nature of these [social] networks makes users incorrectly assume they are not at risk and attackers are using these sites to target new victims,\" Symantec said in its annual Internet Security Threat Report. \"Due to social engineering techniques and the viral nature of social networks, it's much easier for threats to spread from one person to the next.\"\n\nOverall, Symantec blocked 5.5 billion malicious attacks in 2011, which was an 81 percent increase from the year before. The company identified 403 million unique malware variants, while the number of Web attacks that were blocked on a daily basis jumped 36 percent.\n\nWith more and more users picking up smartphones and tablets, it should be no surprise that cyber scammers made mobile a major target.\n\nMobile vulnerabilities increased by 93 percent in 2011, Symantec said, with a \"rise in threats\" that targeted Android.\n\n\"2011 was the first year that mobile malware presented a tangible threat to businesses and consumers,\" Symantec said. \"These threats are designed for activities including data collection, the sending of content, and user tracking.\"\n\nScammers, meanwhile, are no longer only targeting large businesses and high-profile executives when looking to get their hands on private data.\n\n\"More than 50 percent of such attacks target organizations with fewer than 2,500 employees, and almost 18 percent target companies with fewer than 250 employees,\" Symantec found. \"These organizations may be targeted because they are in the supply chain or partner ecosystem of a larger company and because they are less well-defended.\"\n\nAbout 58 percent of the attacks went after low-profile targets, like those in human resources, public relations, and sales - in part because they are easy to identify online.\n\nOverall, about 1.1 million identities were stolen per data breach in 2011. Hacks alone exposed about 187 million identities last year, though lost devices with personal information installed were the most frequent cause of data breaches. Lost or stolen smartphones, USB keys, or backup devices exposed 18.5 million identities last year, Symantec found"}
{"text":"The second rule of the internet\n\nAgainst a sophisticated attacker, nothing connected to the internet is secure.\n\nTo this, I feel like I should add a second item:\n\nEverything is internet now.\n\nWhile there were once large numbers of electronic systems entirely disconnected from the internet, nowadays virtually everything is either connected to the internet constantly or occasionally connected to a device that is online. Your cell phone is probably always accessible to a sophisticated attacker using the internet, and the same is probably true for landlines using VoIP. Many of your computers are probably constantly connected to wireless networks (themselves targets for attack) and exposed to the wider internet through your broadband connection at all times.\n\nWeb integration with computers has reached the point that Google's Chrome browser now treats 'search' and 'GMail' as apps within the Chrome environment.\n\nThe implication of combining the first and second rules is pretty plain. If you manage to attract the attention of a sophisticated attacker, they can probably get into the contents of your cell phone and your GMail account, as well as the hard drive of your PC and laptop, the ubiquitous webcams now built into computers, and so on. There is also a good chance they can take over your email, websites, Twitter accounts, and the like and use them for their own purposes.\n\n\"Kate Murphy writes that as cellphones have gotten smarter, they have become less like phones and more like computers, and that with more than a million phones worldwide already hacked, technology experts expect breached, infiltrated or otherwise compromised cellphones to be the scourge of 2012. Cellphones are often loaded with even more personal information than PCs, so an undefended or carelessly operated phone can result in a breathtaking invasion of individual privacy as well as the potential for data corruption and outright theft. But there are a few common sense ways to protect yourself: Avoid free, unofficial versions of popular apps that often have malware hidden in the code, avoid using Wi-Fi in a Starbucks or airport which leaves you open to hackers, and be wary of apps that want permission to make phone calls, connect to the Internet or reveal your identity and location.\"\n\n\"A massive Android malware campaign may be responsible for duping as many as 5 million users into downloading the Android.Counterclan infection from the Google Android Market. The trojan collects the user's personal information, modifies the home page, and displays unwanted advertisements. It is packaged in 13 different applications, some of which have been on the store for at least a month. Several of the malicious apps are still available on the Android Market as of 3 P.M. ET. Symantec has posted the full list of infected applications.\"\n\n\"Encryption keys on smartphones can be stolen via a technique using radio waves, says one of the world's foremost crypto experts, Paul Kocher, whose firm Cryptography Research will demonstrate the hacking stunt with several types of smartphones at the upcoming RSA Conference in San Francisco next month.\"\n\nYour encryption doesn't work because you cannot keep a key safe. You can't memorize a key that is long enough to be secure and as soon as you write it down electronically an attacker can gain access to it.\n\n\"Elsewhere, driven by the acceleration of computing power and connectivity and the simultaneous development of surveillance systems and tracking technologies, we are approaching a theoretical state of absolute information transparency, one in which 'Orwellian' scrutiny is no longer a strictly hierarchical, top-down activity, but to some extent a democratized one. As individuals steadily lose degrees of privacy, so to do corporations and states. Loss of traditional privacies may seem in the short term to be driven by issues of national security, but this may prove in time to be intrinsic to the nature of ubiquitous information.\n\nCertain goals of the government's Total (now Terrorist) Information Awareness initiative may eventually be realized simply by the evolution of the global information system \u2013 but not necessarily or exclusively for the benefit of the United States or any other government. This outcome may be an inevitable result of the migration to cyberspace of everything that we do with information.\n\nHad Orwell known that computers were coming (out of Bletchley Park, oddly, a dilapidated English country house, home to the pioneering efforts of Alan Turing and other wartime code-breakers) he might have imagined a Ministry of Truth empowered by punch cards and vacuum tubes to better wring the last vestiges of freedom from the population of Oceania. But I doubt his story would have been very different. Would East Germany's Stasi have been saved if its agents had been able to mouse away on PCs into the Nineties? The system would still have been crushed. It just wouldn't have been under the weight of paper surveillance.\"\n\n\""}

{"text":"Hello friends, today i am going to explain what is the difference between hacker and cracker. There are lots of articles on internet about the difference between hackers and crackers. In those articles authors or publishers often try to correct the public misconceptions. For many years, media has erroneously used the hacker word with a cracker. So the general public now believes hacker is someone who breaks into computer systems,hack passwords, websites and misuse them. But this is absolutely untrue and it demoralizes some of our most talented hackers.\n\nThe greatness of misconception you can determine from the fact that world's biggest authentic source WIKIPEDIA has defined hackers in a incorrect way. Wikipedia has defined hackers in the following way...\n\n\"Hacking is unauthorized use of computer and network resources. (The term \"hacker\" originally meant a very gifted programmer. In recent years though, with easier access to multiple systems, it now has negative implications.)\"\n\nThere is a very thin line difference between the hacker and cracker. Like a coin has two faces heads or tails, similar is true for computer experts. Some uses their techniques and expertize to help the others and secure the systems or networks and some misuses them and use that for their own selfish reasons.\n\nThere are several traditional ways that determines the difference between the hackers and crackers. I will provide you these ways in order of their acceptance in the computer and IT market. First of all, let me provide you the basic definitions of both hackers and crackers.\n\nThese definitions are as follows:\n\nHackers : A Hacker is a person who is extremely interested in exploring the things and recondite workings of any computer system or networking system. Most often, hackers are the expert programmers. These are also called Ethical Hackers or white hat hackers. And the technique or hacking they perform is called ethical hacking.\n\nEthical Hacking Means you think like Hackers. i.e First you Hack the Systems and find out the loop holes and then try to correct those Loop Holes..These type of hackers protect the cyberworld from every possible threat and fixes the future coming security loop holes. These peoples are also called as \"GURU's\" of Computer Security.\n\nCrackers: Crackers or Black Hat hackers or cheaters or simply criminals, they are called criminals because they are having the mindset of causing harm to security and they steals very useful data and use it in wrong ways. Phishers also come in this category who steals account info and steal your credit card nos. and money over the Net.\n\nBelow is the Diagrams which shows the basic difference between cracker or black hat hackers and Hackers or ethical hackers or white hat hackers.\n\nI hope this will help you to clear most of your doubts about hackers and crackers. And the most important thing, until and unless a ethical hacker thinks like a cracker you can never become a expert ethical hacker because to get most out of any computer system you must understand the mindset of crackers that what they can do and up to what level they can damage. Now when you will identify the vulnerabilities and loopholes , If you fixes them so that in future anyone cannot breach that same vulnerability then you are Hacker or ethical hacker or White Hat hacker and if you utilize that loophole of misdeeds or for fun then its cracking or Black hat hacking. And black hat hackers are intelligent peoples but criminals or simply cyber cops call them evil genius.\n\nFor more such articles keep visiting our website or simple subscribe our post so that you can directly get this on your email.\n\nIf you have any query ask in form of comments. Also if you like the articles please comment to appreciate the post.\n\nHello friends, welcome back today i am going to share with you all possible ways to hack admin or administrator account in windows XP. Today i will explain how to hack admin or administrator account in just 2 minutes. So guys get ready to hack your friends systems in 2 minutes.\n\nMost of times specially in our college we don't have the access to the admin account, now suppose you want to install a software on that system. What you will do now? Ask the admin to enter the password for you or simply hack it by yourself. I will tell you frankly that i have never opted method one in my life. Whenever i need administrator right i have hacked it but guys don't do it like that ways because i got suspended from lab twice for doing that.\n\nThere are four ways to hack the admin password:\n\n1. Simply accessing Unprotected Administrator Account.\n\n2. Hacking Through Net User Command.\n\n3. Hacking Using the ERD(Emergency Rescue Disk) Commander.\n\n4. Resetting admin password using Ubuntu Live CD or DVD.\n\nLets start from the first technique to hack the admin or administrator password..\n\n1. Simply Accessing the Unprotected Admin or Administrator account.\n\nHow this hack works ? When we install windows XP on our system we usually rename the username as our name or some other keyword. But windows always creates the administrator account whenever we set up windows XP. So when you create your user account during install , windows creates two accounts that is one is your username account and other is Administrator account. But the main thing is that you will only see the account with your username and the Administrator account is hidden but its there and you can easily access that using the following steps:\n\nStep1: Start your computer.\n\nStep2: Now let it start until the windows user's username appears as shown in snapshot below...\n\n1. Insert the ERD Commander Boot CD into the drive and restart the system 2. Boot the computer using ERD Commander Boot CD. You may have to set the boot order in the BIOS first. 3. Select your Windows XP installation from the list as shown.\n\nHello friends in my previous class of How to hack websites, there i explained the various topics that we will cover in hacking classes. Let's today start with the first topic Hacking Websites using SQL injection tutorial. If you have missed the previous hacking class don't worry read it here.\n\nSo guys let's start our tutorial of Hacking Websites using SQL injection technique. First of all, i will provide you the brief introduction about SQL injection.\n\nNote: This article is for Educational Purposes only. Please Don't misuse it. Isoftdl and me are not responsible of any misuse done by you.\n\nMySQL database is very common database system these days that websites use and you will surprise with the fact that its the most vulnerable database system ever.Its has unlimited loopholes and fixing them is a very tedious task. Here we will discuss how to exploit those vulnerabilities manually without any tool.\n\nHacking Websites using SQL Injection\n\nSTEPS TO HACK WEBSITES USING SQL INJECTION\n\n1. Finding the target and vulnerable websites\n\nFirst of all we must find out our target website. I have collected a lot of dorks i.e the vulnerability points of the websites. Some Google Searches can be awesomely utilized to find out vulnerable Websites.. Below is example of some queries..\n\nExamples: Open the Google and copy paste these queries...\n\ninurl:index.php?id=\n\ninurl:trainers.php?id=\n\ninurl:buy.php?category=\n\ninurl:article.php?ID=\n\ninurl:play_old.php?id=\n\ninurl:declaration_more.php?decl_id=\n\ninurl:pageid=\n\ninurl:games.php?id=\n\ninurl:page.php?file=\n\ninurl:newsDetail.php?id=\n\ninurl:gallery.php?id=\n\nSearch google for more google dorks to hack websites. I cannot put them on my website as they are too critical to discuss. We can discuss them in comments of this posts so keep posting and reading there.\n\n2. Checking for Vulnerability on the website\n\nSuppose we have website like this:-\n\nh**p:\/\/\n\nTo test this URL, we add a quote to it '\n\nh**p:\/\/\n\nOn executing it, if we get an error like this: \"You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right etc...\"Or something like that, that means the target website is vulnerable to sql injection and you can hack it.\n\n3). Find the number of columns\n\nTo find number of columns we use statement ORDER BY (tells database how to order the result) so how to use it? Well just incrementing the number until we get an error.\n\nh**p:\/\/ order by 1\/* --> no error\n\nh**p:\/\/ order by 2\/* --> no error\n\nh**p:\/\/ order by 3\/* --> no error\n\nh**p:\/\/ order by 4\/* --> Error (we get message like this Unknown column '4' in 'order clause' or something like that)\n\nthat means that the it has 3 columns, cause we got an error on 4.\n\n4). Check for UNION function\n\nWith union we can select more data in one sql statement.\n\nSo we have\n\nh**p:\/\/ union all select 1,2,3\/*\n\n(we already found that number of columns are 3 in section 2). )\n\nif we see some numbers on screen, i.e 1 or 2 or 3 then the UNION works .\n\n5). Check for MySQL version\n\nh**p:\/\/ union all select 1,2,3\/*\n\nNOTE: if \/* not working or you get some error, then try --\n\nit's a comment and it's important for our query to work properly.\n\nLet say that we have number 2 on the screen, now to check for version\n\nwe replace the number 2 with @@version or version() and get someting like 4.1.33-log or 5.0.45 or similar.\n\nWelcome friends, yesterday i have introduced the topic \" How to hack the wifi or wireless Networks\" in which i have explained the various wireless scanning tools with their download links. Today i will explain you how to use them. So today we will discuss scanning of wireless networks so that we can get the list of wireless networks around us and we can try our hacks on them. So guys lets continue Hacking Wireless Networks - part 2.\n\nYesterday i have given you the list of topics that we cover in hacking wireless networks so lets continue the second topic.\n\n2. Scanning the Wireless Networks or Wifi Networks\n\nWhat is meant by scanning wireless networks?\n\nFirst of all we have to locate all the wireless networks around us. For this we have to do the scan for wireless networks its pity similar like we scan with antivirus for viruses in our system. Similarly we look for wireless networks around us with wireless scanning tools that i have mentioned yesterday.\n\nYesterday i have mentioned a lot of hack tools to scan the wireless networks but as i have said earlier my favorite is NetStumbler. Let's discuss now how to use NetStumbler?\n\n2. Run the NetStumbler. Then it will automatically starts scanning the wireless Networks around you.\n\n3. Once its completed, you will see the complete list of wireless networks around you as shown in the snapshot below:\n\nList of Wireless Networks Scanned by NetStumbler\n\nThere you will see different columns such as MAC, SSID, SPEED, VENDOR, TYPE and much more...\n\n4. Now select anyone of the MAC address that you wish to hack and want to explore more about that. If you click on the MAC address of one of the discovered wireless networks under channels, you will see a graph that shows the wireless network's signal strength. The more green and the less spaces are there,it indicates better is signal strength.\n\n5. As you can see NetStumbler provides a lot more than just the name (SSID) of the wireless network. It provides the MAC address, Channel number, encryption type, and a bunch more. All of these come in use when we decides that we wants to get in the secured network by cracking the encryption.\n\nThere are two most common types of Encryption Methods used by Wireless Networks:\n\na. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) \u2013 WEP isn't considered safe anymore. Many flaws have been discovered that allow hackers to crack a WEP key easily. I will explain how to hack the WEP in next tutorial so guys keep reading..\n\nb. WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) \u2013 WAP is the currently the most secure and best option to secure your wireless network. It's not as easily cracked as WEP because the only way to retrieve a WAP key is to use a brute-force or dictionary attack. If your key is secure enough, a dictionary attack won't work and it could take decades to crack it if you brute-force it. This is why most hackers don't even bother. But I will explain you smarter ways to hack WAP keys also rather than these noobish methods. I will explain this in my next consecutive tutorials. So guys keep visiting.\n\nThats all about scanning the wireless networks, if you want that i should explain the other tools then please post in comments. I can explain them in future on demand.\n\nNow how can protect our wireless network from scanned by NetStumber.\n\nHow to Protect yourself from NetStumbler?\n\n1. Don not broadcast your SSID.\n\n2. Always try to use stronger passwords like atleast one digit, one special character, uppercase letters mixed with lowercase letters.\n\n3. But second point doesn't matter much so try to use better encryption method i.e. WAP to password protect your wireless Network.\n\nSo guys that's all for today , I hope you all have liked it. So keep visiting to know more about hacking.\n\nHello Friends, this year is going to end and so for ending this year their must be something special. So today i will explain How to hack wifi or wireless network in just 10 to 15 minutes. In this tutorial of hacking wireless network i will explain from very start means tutorial of extremely novice users and also explain the ways to protect your wireless networks from hackers. So guys read on...\n\nTopics that we cover in this tutorial:\n\n1. Wifi or Wireless Scanning tools\n\n2. Scanning the Wireless Networks or Wifi Networks.\n\n3. WEP hacking and cracking tools\n\n4. Cracking the WEP key of wifi or Wireless Networks\n\n5. Wireless Sniffing Tools\n\n6. Wireless Sniffing technique\n\n7. Security Measures to protect yourself from these attacks.\n\nGuys you must know everything that's why i am explaining each and everything in this tutorials related to wireless networks or wifi hacking. Its a complete wireless network hacking tutorial with all hacking tools and how to use them. Using these you will came to know how to hack wifi or wireless networks and note guys this tutorial is 110% working like other one's.\n\nNote: This article is only for Educational Purposes so that you can understand the loopholes in wireless networks and fix them. Any misuse can result in disastrous consequences like cyber crime.\n\nDon't worry everything is ethical till you misuses it. So always try to be ethical as far as possible. Lets start from the first topic...\n\n1. WIRELESS SCANNING TOOLS\n\nScanning tools is needed to scan the wifi or wireless networks around you. First of all we need to scan all the wireless networks so that we can select the wireless network to hack. There are several wireless scanning tools but my favorite is NET STUMBLER. And for Mac operating systems is MacStumbler.\n\nThere are several Wireless scanning tools, a list of all wireless scanning tools is given below:\n\na. NetStumbler for Windows operating systems.MacStumbler is a small utility to emulate the functionality of projects like netstumbler, bsd-airtools, and kismet. It's meant purely for educational or auditing purposes, although many people enjoy using these types of programs to check out how many WiFi (wireless) networks are in their area, usually known as \"war driving\".\n\nMacStumbler only works with AirPort wireless cards, it does not (yet) work with any PCMCIA or USB wireless devices.\n\nTHC-WarDrive is a tool for mapping your city for wavelan networks with a GPS device while you are driving a car or walking through the streets. THC-WarDrive is effective and flexible, a \"must-download\" for all wavelan nerds.\n\nPrismstumbler is software which finds 802.11 (WLAN) networks. It comes with an easy to use GTK2 frontend and is small enough to fit on a small portable system. It is designed to be a flexible tool to find as much information about wireless LAN installations as possible. Because of its client-server architecture the scanner engine may be used for different frontends.\n\nMognet is a free, open source wireless ethernet sniffer\/analyzer written in Java. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It was designed with handheld devices like the iPaq in mind, but will run just as well on a desktop or laptop to find wireless networks.\n\nWaveStumbler is console based 802.11 network mapper for Linux. It reports the basic AP stuff like channel, WEP, ESSID, MAC etc. It has support for Hermes based cards (Compaq, Lucent\/Agere, \u2026 ) It still in development but tends to be stable. It consist of a patch against the kernel driver, orinoco.c which makes it possible to send the scan command to the driver viathe \/proc\/hermes\/ethX\/cmds file. The answer is then sent back via a netlink socket. WaveStumbler listens to this socket and displays the output data on the console.\n\nStumbVerter is a standalone application which allows you to import Network Stumbler's summary files into Microsoft's MapPoint 2002 maps. The logged WAPs will be shown with small icons, their colour and shape relating to WEP mode and signal strength.\n\nWireless Access Point Utilites for Unix - it's a set of utilites to configure and monitor Wireless Access Points under Unix using SNMP protocol. Utilites knownly compiles and run under Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and AIX.\n\nWavemon is a ncurses based application for wireless hardware. It`s running currently under Linux with cards witch supported by Jean Tourrilhes wireless extensions. You will find them in the Kernel 2.4. I used this tool a few times, it`s small, works, opensource and good.\n\nAirTraf 1.0 is a wireless sniffer that can detect and determine exactly what is being transmitted over 802.11 wireless networks. This open-source program tracks and identifies legitimate and rogue access points, keeps performance statistics on a by-user and by-protocol basis, measures the signal strength of network components, and more."}

{"text":"Update: Arizona police have stated the leaked documents appear to be authentic: \"Spokesman Steve Harrison of the Arizona agency said the documents appeared to be authentic and said LulzSec most likely accessed them via the email accounts of eight officers.\" [Source]\n\nLulzSec's \"Operation Anti-Security\" has officially kicked off with its first release, a day earlier than expected. LulzSec has posted the following press statement in regards to the leak - the government, corporations, police, and militaries of the world. See you again real soon! ;D\n\nThough I have not had a chance to dig deep into the information (in-depth analysis from ZDNet's finest is soon to come), what accompanies the press release is enough to see that the information is as bad as it sounds -- especially to the individuals who have had all of their personal credentials leaked for all the world to see. In one case, an officer's wife is identified along with her email address.\n\nNo one is spared in this release.\n\nStill unclear at this point is how vast the reach of LulzSec goes, but this release shows that it doesn't particularly matter. With no names and no definitive numbers of people, there is no telling who all this group is comprised of; the perfect scenario for talented hackers looking to exploit behind anonymity in numbers.\n\nUnfortunately, they have now proven they have the wherewithal to secure classified documents and personal information beyond that of what simple database exploits have yielded thus far. And this is just the beginning.\n\nLulzSec has stated that there is more to come on Monday. Stay tuned and fasten your seat belts, because it's going to be a bumpy ride as the ante has just been upped considerably from simple DDoS attacks \"for the lulz\" to cause-driven releases.\n\nI would bankrupt each one\n\nEach caught member needs to go through two cases. They need a civil case so they can be sued so hard they're screwed for life. Then, they need a criminal case to put them away for a while. Hack them rocks into smaller rocks ;D\n\nMark your calendars\n\nJune 23, 2011 will be noted as the end of the 'cloud' fallacy. What corporation, government, or even slightly-paranoid individual is going to allow even a sliver of REAL content or data over the public Internet any longer. The next thing that will appear are a lot of front-end servers going down, not from these goofballs but from those who (even with nothing to hide) won't risk even a hair's breath of a chance their internal systems can be touched from the public cloud. Because as much as one would hope the pack of wolves (lawyers) would go after Lulzsec in reality it is the corporations, governments and their insurers who will take the hit first. This will be even uglier than Wikileaks could even get, and the risk get way too high. Oh well, at least we will have stupid teenage drinking binge videos and dancing cats!\n\nOnce they come up with a way to trace the activities\n\n@jwspicer then the US government will be able to declare war on the terrorists, and use military force to end the problem. I have every confidence that the government will not allow itself to be brought down by any means without a very good fight. As history has shown, the US government and people have a tendency to prevail.\n\n@sparkle farkle\nThere currently exists, IFF the server pros and ISPs wished to, a way to track everythinig\/everyone that posts anything on the 'net simply by mostly employing existing RFCs. Spam could be stopped with smple protocol enforcement, and the 'net side I'll leave to the imaginatioin of others' conjecture because I've only read, not experienced those issues.\n\n@jwspicer\nTo a degree, maybe. But when you consider the lack of intelligence discovered in places like Sony and others w\/r to security, it's not very encouraging to think that any but the most successful and intelligent companiies\/people will even give a thought to things like that. Of the ones that have been exposed so far, nearly any kiddie could have cracked them wthout a lot of trouble.\n\na child can kill also\n\n@tom@... but we don't condone the killing because it's possible, and really don't tolerate any excuse for doing so. At this point they are beginning to reveal agents that are protecting the country from bad people. Anyone can wield a weapon, but because it's easy to use isn't an excuse. I recently saw an interview where the military said something to the effect \"in cases where internet activity threatens US interests, that military action is an option.\"\nOpenly attacking the CIA and law enforcement would come under that kind of blanket.\n\nCheers\n\nThe truth will be exposed; that is of the utmost importance. Has anyone died as a result of their actions? Isn't the harm they cause simply anecdotal? It is non-violent, indifferent to profit, and inevitable. Any company who loses market share from these attacks does so because of their own lack of due diligence in securing their systems, customer information, and their reputation. Protection of capitalism and its beneficiaries comes last in priority to justice. I think it is in a government's interest to spread fear - if only to pass more laws to maintain their illusion of control and righteousness - instead of being found in a position to answer to the people. If you cut off our freedom, so too will you be cut off from the right to rule us. The King's of the Earth, the owners of your debt, deserve to tremble.\n\nSpare us\n\n@Vapur9\nYou don't appear to have a clue how many poor and innocent Mexicans are dying at the hands of the drug cartels that will be aided immensely by this action. This is the worst sort of youthful arrogance and stupidity. It is good intentions causing death and destruction for innocent people. May everyone involved rot in Hell.\n\nDid you know that the cartels are stopping buses on Mexican roads and forcing passengers to fight gladiator-like battles to the death, with the \"winners\" forced to serve at hit-men for the cartel? This is what LulzSec is helping with this action.\n\nThat is our government's fault: Prohibition is the cause of crime\n\n@Robert Hahn\n\nBack in the era of prohibition, the unintended side effect of the law was that the price of booze went up, gangs became prevalent, and the profits reigned in from the increased prices were helping to purchase the guns being used for turf warfare. Once prohibition ended, the profit motive of these gangs disappeared and moved to other illicit activities. If anyone is to blame, it is the government and their attitude toward crime and prevention. Their continued advocacy for prohibition is the direct cause of crime, and the war on drugs will continue to fuel those flames.\n\nThat is stupid\n\nThe rum runners were still wrong to kill people. It wasn't the Government's fault that people decided to take the law into their own hands. Blaming the law for the violence is simply a person trying to not take any responsibility for their actions.\n\nDo you really think this is helping anybody? Aside from the Mexican cartels that are getting helped, the terrorists that will have the information, and various other violent people getting information, right?\n\nNobody is hurt... aside from everyone. We're all put in danger by these idiots who think they're justice.\n\n=\/\n\n@goff256\n\nDid they claim to be justice or were they simply doing it for the Lulz? And I partly understand the thought process involved in thinking that everyone is being hurt by these actions, because you maximize and exaggerate its impact to include yourself - even though not being personally affected - and imply that they are solely responsible for any future deaths. Violent people will continue to be violent so long as they declare their misguided loyalty to the highest bidder, regardless of what war is being fought. Any death from these leaks are unfortunate, but ultimately the current efforts to prevent them were futile anyway. A change needs to happen, but it obviously won't be one we hope for. What else can be done anyway?\n\nNo, you underestimate\n\nLives could be saved with the efforts of the police, the efforts that are being stopped through Lulzsec's efforts.

{"text":"Are you worried because of recent hacking incidents at Lockheed Martin , SONY and PBS? Now many organisations are fearing that they might be attacked by hackers.So what to do to prevent cyber-crime of all types and sizes? Here is a solution(by ISAT) which you can use for preventing any kind of hackers attack.\n\nDemonstrating how easy it is for cybercriminals to deceive untrained staff, Sjouwerman cites KnowBe4's recent FAIL500 phishing experiment. The company successfully delivered simulated phishing emails to about three-fifths of the companies featured in the Inc. 5000; and nearly 500 of them had at least one employee who clicked the link within the email.\n\nWhile KnowBe4's emails had no malicious payload, a 2010 Symantec survey of small and midsize businesses (SMBs) reveals the potential scope of the problem, with 73% of respondents reporting at least one actual cyber attack in the previous 12 months.\n\nTo combat these external threats, Sjouwerman offers five simple tips on how to prevent cybercrime that can be quickly and easily implemented by both companies and end-users:\n\nChange passwords regularly. While employees may balk at being required to change their passwords on a routine basis, it is an important step in thwarting access by cybercriminals. Sjouwerman recommends changing network, email, database and other passwords at least once a month, and not reusing passwords.\n\nEnforce strong passwords. Simple words and number strings may be easy to remember, but they're also easy for cybercriminals to uncover with password-cracking software. Sjouwerman suggests using symbols or numbers in place of letters to make passwords more difficult to crack. For example, the password STOP-PHISHING might be rendered as $T0P-P#!$#!N6. Developing a complex passphrase is another option.\n\nThink before you click. Cybercriminals have become adept at producing realistic-looking emails. They use familiar logos and email address spoofing to make it appear as if the message is sent by someone known and trusted by the recipient, such as a business partner, bank or government agency. It's easy to make a hyperlink display a familiar URL when the actual link directs elsewhere. Before clicking any link, hover the cursor over it and check the address displayed in the status bar. If it shows an unfamiliar URL, do not click. Instead, report the suspicious email to a system administrator and then delete it.\n\nIf in doubt, throw it out. This follows from the previous tip. If an email raises any red flags \u2013 whether it comes from an unknown sender or contains an unusual request or unexpected file from someone familiar \u2013 it's best to avoid clicking any links or downloading any attachments. A quick call to the sender can reveal if an email is legitimate or if the owner's email account has been compromised; while a brief Internet search can expose an email from an unknown sender to be a scam. If there is any doubt, it's best to delete the email, and\/or follow corporate policy.\n\nImplement company-wide Internet security training. Without a formal ISAT program in place, well-meaning employees can be tricked into responding to a cybercriminal's phishing attempts.\n\nKnowBe4 offers a free phishing security test companies can use to determine how susceptible their employees are to social engineering. Those who choose to implement KnowBe4's ISAT services will receive high-quality, web-based interactive training for all employees, along with a series of scheduled tests to pinpoint weaknesses and determine if free re-training is required.\n\nIn addition to the recommendations outlined above, Sjouwerman notes that system administrators can do their part to prevent cybercrime by following these Internet security best practices:\n\nEnsure that all accounts have unique passwords, which should be unusual and difficult to guess.\n\nUpdate the network configuration as soon as vulnerabilities become known.\n\nCheck with vendors regularly for important upgrades and patches.\n\nAudit systems and check logs on an ongoing basis to detect and trace intruders.\n\nTrain all employees to identify and avoid cybercrime tactics, and instruct them to report any suspected phishing attempts or potential security beaches."}

That doesn't seem unlikely, but no report such as the Times' publishing of Mandiant's claims has been put forth.\n\nThe AP's report specifically details \"fines, penalties and other trade restrictions as initial, more-aggressive steps\" that may be taken, in the wake of the report.\n\nIt's one thing to have sporadic incidents, but that the Chinese military has a unit in place that invades companies such as Coca-Cola when it is in negotiations with Chinese interests demonstrates that such incursions are commonplace. The United States has long butted heads with China over intellectual property and knock-off goods.\n\nCybersecurity legislation, the sort of thing designed to prevent this sort of issue, has been festering in Congress for some time now. The House, in a fit of backwards-thinking, reintroduced the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) without new provisions for consumer privacy. That bill was flat ignored in the Senate, and had a veto-threat hung around its neck. The President has issued a lengthy cybersecurity executive order, but it has limited purview.\n\nIn short, from the perspective of staving off more such attacks, the United States is talking some and doing nothing. However, the government might increase the size of the stick and the frequency of its swing in formally responding to cyberattacks. China's response will be a key indicator to watch.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe should name this hacker group PingaLings after their Panda and the IP tool ping :}\n\nGoST BaBeL\n\nPlease be sure to collect your US government compensation for publishing this patriotic piece during our complete and absolute massacre of our cyberintelligence by actual functioning foreign agencies.\n\n Pete Braun\n\nThe butting heads over knock-off goods part doesn't surprise me. Especially with cars. Initially, they bought the rights to make cars there, among them a combination of the Austin Maestro and Montego called the CA6410UA. In the late 1990s, a Chinese tobacco company bought the tooling rights to make the Maestro and Montego in their country. To get the money, though, they had to tell the government that they were building buses. Those cars were shoddy in their native Great Britain, so imagine how bad they must've been being using old tank parts by a company that's basically the Chinese equivalent of Winston or Marlboro. It wasn't long before various bright spots began to think, \"Why buy the rights to make cars we don't want, when we can just copy the ones we do?\" They did. Among the cars you'll find clones of made there include the BMW X5, Fiat Panda, Smart Fortwo, Daewoo Matiz, Mini Cooper (called a Mingi (however you spell it) over there), and the Toyota Aygo (called an FO in China, which I think is a coded message to Toyota telling them what to do if Toyota ever decide to sue the fake makers). BMW and Smart both sued the fake makers of their respective X5 and Fortwo models and as a result, there was a ban on sales of the X5 fake, called the Shuanghuan S-CEO, in BMW's home country of Germany. The Fortwo clone is called the Shuanghuan Noble and Daimler didn't fare quite as well.\n\nAnd the scary part? The Chinese government said the S-CEO doesn't look anything like an X5. I've seen photos of both, and they do look remarkably similar. Same with Fortwo and the Noble, although those two aren't quite as identical. Look 'em up, people."}

{"text":"How Botnets monetize and gain profit\n\nThe monetizing stage of a botnet is vast and quite often the main purpose of why a botnet was started in the first place, the list is not exhaustible and new methods\/ideas are being used each year, as you may read in bot-related articles. Some examples of the monetizing process are:\n\nWeb Injects\/Keylogging - Stealing information for specific websites, or stealing every keystroke\/cache it can. While you may think not much can be brought of this, ZeuS, SpyEye and other various 'carding' bots have proven this to be beneficial to the bot herder\/criminal rings involved. Credit card and bank information, if coupled with the people who have the know-how and the correct connections, leads to easy retirement (or easy jail sentence).\n\nDDoS - Botnets are often made specifically for power, the DDoS module of a botnet can actually be utilised for monetizing through extortion (You don't pay, we bring your site down) where many small companies would laugh this threat off, larger companies dependant on their internet services would most likely co-operate. You may sell your DDoS Services.\n\nSpam - Botnets can be used to generate a large number of efficient spam (I say efficient because there is no centralised SMTP server) and subsequently, generate traffic to various web-stores; usually advertising goods such as viagra, etc.\n\nRansomware - Ransomware can hold the system's files at ransom by encrypting the files with 256bit encryption (or similar) RSA and asking for a specific sum of money for the release of these files.\n\nScareware - In a similar fashion, scareware will socially engineer the victim to enter credit card details and purchase a 'fix' for a virus present on their system.\n\nBlackhat SEO\/Generating web traffic - A website with the correct metadata can be boosted up in the google rankings if the webtraffic of thousands of bots visit the website \u2013 using Botnets for SEO purposes is a great way of monetizing.\n\nThese are just some examples of the methods employed by bot herders, I can think of a few more on the spot and a lot more eventually \u2013 but this is just to give you an insight on what is currently possible\/happening\u2026 ;)\n\nAdclicking is one method similar to the blackhat SEO technique, most of them actually use the same type of bots with the same functions. The bot herder would issue a command like: .visit \n\n. being the command prefix (to introduce a command) visit being the command name  being the desired website to visit.\n\nAdditionally, some bot's allow the user to choose whether to visit the website without showing a browser (so the victim doesn't notice) and others specifically open the website in a browser. This is how a lot of system pop-ups are opened (those that appear without visiting websites in the first place). These pay-per-click schemes generally do not develop a large income, and if they do \u2013 is usually a small one-time burst, rather than a long-term income. Not something to really consider if you aim to start a botnet in the first place.\n\nSimilar to the pay-per-visit campaigns available, there is also PPI (pay per install) where a bot herder can install a software application (usually adware) and receive a payment in return for each bot (say $0.50), obviously, over a large amount of bots \u2013 this can accumulate a lot, not to mention selling these bots to multiple software vendors. Problems exist with these methods however, as a lot of these PPI companies 'shave' the bots, meaning that they will claim only 1\/2 of the bots actually successfully installed the application or they go to the extent of attempting to botkill the bots, removing the bots from the sellers botnet. Many of these companies are closed within the first few months of operation, but some more 'legitimate' schemes exist that specify not to install the software on systems without the owner's permission.\n\nBitcoin Mining - Well, this is something new these days and would be really beneficial to earn a lot if you are into Bitcoins. Won't go deep into this though.\n\nRemember, the methods that exist today and the ones listed above are all 'the main methods' but of course, the ones that will make the most money are the 0days \u2013 coming up with your own way of making money (and incorporating this into your botnet source) is the way to victory. Think of an action that can make you a small amount of money, if you sat doing it hour after hour, day after day would fetch you alot of money \u2013 that may be your key. Botnets offer distributed automation of a process, use it to your advantage\u2026\n\nAbout FastFlux\n\nOwner of ZeroSecurity, intrested in programming, malware analysis and penetration testing.

{"text":"Google opens door to hackers\n\nHackers no longer even need to visit a website to attack it, instead they are using information from pages cached by popular search engine Google according to a report in the New Scientist.\n\nOne way hackers can break into a website is by hunting for private pages containing the passwords or usernames required to access secure parts of the site. These pages are normally hidden from the casual browser, but sometimes faulty software or failure to properly delete such pages make this data available, creating a serious security loophole, according to the report.\n\nHackers normally have to trawl the web searching for such vulnerabilities, but professional hacker Johnny Long told the New Scientist that search engines, such as Google, have made the task much easier.\n\nSearch engines work by following all the links on a page and caching the information they find to create a searchable database of web pages. So if a page contains a link to a private page the search engine will follow it and store the cached page. This means that hackers can search for common words found on pages containing sensitive information, such as 'cash history', 'temporary' and 'password'."}

Stall's computer was infected with the virus the moment she clicked on the link from Morey Safer her Facebook friend. With a second computer side by side with Stall's, she was able to see how everything she typed, from bank account information to credit card information at Amazon.com was showing up on the second computer almost as instantly as she typed.

In check out lines, coffee shops and gyms across the country people are chatting about Conficker, often referred to as the Conficker computer virus or the April 1st computer virus.\n\nConficker is actually not a computer virus but rather is a computer program, which isn't to say that couldn't be very dangerous. It has invaded millions of computers world wide that run on Microsoft Widows by linking one infected computer with another building a large, coordinated machine that computer specialist call a botnet.

The issue was caused by an SQL infection, which targets data-driven applications.\n\nOn Dec. 28, Penn State sent letters to the students whose Social Security numbers may have been compromised.\n\nThe university said it was time-consuming to determine how much personally identifiable information the injection put at risk. As of right now, we know that an outside computer accessed the Social Security information, but there's no evidence that unauthorized people used it.\n\nIf this is the case, we are lucky that no personal information was compromised. If this were to ever happen again, we might not be this lucky.\n\nBut why, when so many awful situations could have arisen, would the university wait so long to tell students about a possible breach in security? Obviously, no one wants his or her Social Security number in the hands of the wrong person.\n\nStudents from Penn State Altoona could have had assets removed from their personal accounts.\n\nIt's concerning that the university would wait so long to notify students. Students could have taken that time to better try to protect themselves.\n\nOf course, it's understandable that it took time to investigate the problem and compile a full list of students to notify of the possible problem, but the university definitely could have taken more steps to ensure the safety of its former students.\n\nWhy couldn't the university let all Penn State Altoona students who attended before 2005 know that there was a possible security threat and advise former students to monitor their personal accounts? There was no advantage to not disclosing this information for three months.\n\nSome people rarely, if ever, check their personal accounts to make sure they are up-to-date. It was important to let them monitor potential threats because, without notification, a huge problem could have gone unnoticed for months.\n\nAccording to the 2012 Identity Fraud Survey Report, more than 11.6 million adults in the United States were exposed to identity fraud in 2011 \u2014 a 13 percent increase from 2010.\n\nMost individuals who experienced identity theft ended up paying hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket as a result, according to the study.\n\nMost likely, none of the students from Penn State Altoona would be happy about paying a few hundred extra dollars.\n\nSome students probably do not even know how to look up their information, so they can monitor their accounts. It would probably be beneficial for students receive more guidance as to how to be careful with their online data. One idea would be to incorporate it into a freshman seminar course"}

Hackers are ramping up their efforts, however, unleashing a variety of attacks that specifically target smartphone owners.\n\nIn the past year, \"we've noticed a 900 percent increase of malware for mobile devices that run the Android OS,\" said Catalin Cosoi, global research director at Romanian security firm Bitdefender. \"Although some of the samples are oriented towards profit, by sending text messages or phoning to premium-rate numbers, the wide majority [are] focused on extracting personal information from the device, such as contacts, text messages, browser history and GPS location.\"\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the top eight terrible threats that smartphone owners should be aware of.\n\nSmishing\n\nA short text-messaging variation on phishing attacks, smishing uses text messages to trick victims into calling a fake bank or credit card company and divulging his or her account number and password, under the pretext of needing to confirm a purchase or update security settings. When the customer calls the texted number, a voicemail system set up by the cybercrook records the account number and password.\n\nWi-Fi Hijacking\n\nEveryone wants a free ride, so some hackers set up free Wi-Fi hotspots in public places such as parks, cafes, and airports. Unsuspecting users who log onto the hot spot are then monitored for passwords, credit card numbers, and account information.\n\nWar Texting\n\nFirst demonstrated on connected car systems such as GM's OnStar that allow owners to remotely unlock or start their vehicles, war texting is a hacking technique that sniffs out the codes used to communicate between a smartphone and a car. Once the codes have been uncovered, the hacker can unlock and start the vehicle without a key. In some cases, the criminal may also be able to track the car if someone else is driving it."}

{"text":"Data breach? Virtual bounty hunters will hunt it down\n\nThe security company CloudeyeZ is taking a new approach to helping companies manage data breaches\n\nJune 19, 2012, 1:01 AM \u2014 Security expert Dan Clements is building a virtual \"lost and found\" box for data, a concept he hopes companies suffering from data breaches will embrace to find out just how bad the damage is.\n\nClements launched his startup, called CloudeyeZ, last September. He has since been nurturing an idea he says could save companies money by getting a better handle on how much data they've lost.\n\n\"There aren't a lot of solutions for companies that are hacked,\" Clements said.\n\nCloudeyeZ in California has a few different services. It works with freelance computer security consultants around the world who specialize in infiltrating forums, for example, that trade in stolen credit card and bank account details.\n\n\"We are virtual bounty hunters,\" Clements said.\n\nIf a bank suspects it has been hacked, it could give CloudeyeZ a sample of the data believed to have been stolen, such as a Bank Identification Number (BIN) which identifies a bank associated with a credit or debit card. CloudeyeZ investigators report back where it was found, and leaves the next action to the bank, Clements said.\n\nContacting law enforcement is sometimes \"a last resort\" when companies are trying to assess what was hacked, Clements said. The stolen data often isn't identified, and the perpetrators -- many who are likely to live outside the U.S. -- are unlikely to be prosecuted.\n\nHe envisions CloudeyeZ as a step before contacting law enforcement, where companies can get a grasp on what is lost and figure out the least expensive way of handling it.\n\nCloudeyeZ is building a database called the Blind DB to store small bits of text and numbers, which could be matched with lost data. Only vetted parties would have access. CloudeyeZ hopes law enforcement agencies will eventually contribute stolen data so it can be matched with organizations hit with a data breach, Clements said. CloudeyeZ doesn't hold all of the data it finds, as it would rather direct people to where the data is actually hosted.\n\nCloudeyeZ is also experimenting with posting bits of information to Twitter: one of the latest cryptic clues revealed is \"52082XXX24,5013,110,33617, wesley, IT guy.\"\n\nThe company also has an escrow arrangement where it acts as a middle-man between a finder of information and its seeker, collecting 20 percent of the reward money. CloudeyeZ provides a sample of the suspected stolen data to its bounty hunters, who then search the underground, contacting their own informants for more information.\n\nIn one case, a bank paid a reward for finding some of its intellectual property, Clements said. How does an organization ensure it isn't buying its own property back from the thief? It doesn't, Clements said."}
{"text":"Abstract: As society moves into the digital age, international interactions are increasing hinge on cyber technologies for the realms of diplomacy, military, business, social interactions, and commerce. Technology has become a necessary aspect of daily life and interstate relations. When goods and activities are critical and valuable to society, these activities also become predatory targets.\n\nThis chapter will examine the concept of rivalry and repeated disputes through the lens of technology and cyberwar. Most wars occur under a situation of long-standing, mutual animosity or what scholars call rivalry. To understand how rivalries evolve in the current era it is important to investigate if cyber warfare increases tensions in an enemy dyad. What cyber capabilities do rivals have and then, what are the consequences of technological attacks on infrastructure during international tensions? As a weapon, can cyber attacks increase hostility in a rivalry? All these questions are important policy concerns that must be addressed as rivalry and international competition shifts from the conventional battlefield to the technological battlefield. Has cyberwar changed the fundamental nature of modern interstate rivalry?"}

{"text":"As we close out 2012, there is no doubt that this year will go down as epic in the history books of information security professionals. Looking back on the year it's not hard to find a laundry list of security programs that have been overrun by nefarious perpetrators or to see how dramatically different the risk landscape is today than just a year ago. Taking stock of it all, the following are some of the most notable attacks:\n\nMarch 2012 \u2013 Operation Global Blackout \u2013 Group Anonymous threatens to take out the internet by attacking the DNS infrastructure of the world\n\nJuly \u2013 Aug 2012 \u2013 Admin.HLP Trojan wreaks havoc in wild\n\nAug 2012 \u2013 AT&T suffers a near day long outage originating from an attack on their DNS infrastructure\n\nSept \u2013 Oct 2012 \u2013 Operation Ababil launched against US banking and financial institutions. The vast majority of US banks suffer various degrees of outages, attacks leverage new SSL tool\n\nNov \u2013 Dec 2012 \u2013 OpIsrael & OpZionism launched against various Israeli interests as a result of ongoing political struggles.\n\nWhile these are just a few of this year's attack profiles, there are more than enough lessons to be learned from each event to teach security professionals for months and years to come.\n\nSo, what did we learn from this year of carnage? I think we would be fooling ourselves if we believed that the overall success of this past year's attacks could be attributed to luck or isolated to a few obscure examples. These attacks were by-and-large effective across a multitude of technologies, geographies and industries.\n\nThe attacks seemed to have little correlation on the surface as their effectiveness seemed to be felt without regard to the size of the company, geographic operations, the security technologies these organizations had in place or the amount of people studying the problem (e.g. security professionals, risk assessment results, etc).\n\nHowever, if we are honest with ourselves, not all of the attacks have been successful thus far. There have been notable security programs that have weathered the storm by-and-large intact. Although they shall remain nameless to protect them from undue future attention, these programs were indeed different from the ones that suffered outages.\n\nThe people behind these programs are really the unsung heroes of 2012. These security professionals have provided us with a stable model of defense going forward. Let's look at what they've taught us.\n\nSecurity blind spots\n\nOverall, the programs that were most effective against cyber attacks have taught us that they are doing something other (failed) programs are not. In the vernacular of security professionals, the difference between an effective program and an ineffective program is called a 'security blind spot'."}
{"text":"Internet and computer security has received growing attention. Newspapers have carried articles about the impact of denial of service attacks, the cost of cyberfraud, the embarrassment of website vandalism, and the interference to business by worms and viruses. But September 11 caused us to look at security in a new light-not just isolated incidents that annoy, but attacks that destroy. The critical infrastructure we depend upon and take for granted has been shown to be vulnerable and open to unexpected destruction.\n\nCritical Infrastructures as defined by the Government are \"systems whose incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the nation. They include: telecommunications, electrical power systems, gas and oil, banking and finance, transportation, water supply systems, government services and emergency services.\" Critical infrastructures increasingly depend upon information technology, are more and more interconnected, and are largely unprotected from malicious attack.\n\nEven before the World Trade Center attack, the vulnerability of these systems has been of national concern. The Government and the press have moved to address these issues.\n\nIn July, 1996 the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection was established as the first national effort to address the vulnerabilities created in the new information age. \n\nIn February 1998, the FBI established the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), which has the mission to serve as the U.S. government's focal point for threat assessment, warning, investigation, and response for threats or attacks against our critical infrastructures. \n\nIn last summer, James Adams in his \"Virtual Defense\" article in Foreign Affairs, argued that given the U.S. military dominance and high-tech weapons, the next war is apt to be against the highly insecure civilian infrastructure through their information systems. Thomas Friedman in his July 27 New York Times article claimed that cyberattack is the big threat, not atomic bombs.\n\nThis October the President created the Office of Homeland Security, the Homeland Security Council and the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board to recommend policies and coordinate programs protecting information systems for critical infrastructure. \n\nThis fall the Congress has been working on bills to support the improvement of vulnerability assessment and technological and systems solutions.\n\nThis seminar raises a series of timely and important questions: If we look at the nation's critical infrastructures, how much do they depend upon information technology? How vulnerable are they? What is the current state of preparedness for recovery? How can research help protect us? What is the current state of research and implementation of protections? What are the policy implications of different solutions? Where shall we go from here?"}

For example, an employee in an enterprise may be tricked into revealing an employee identification number to someone who is pretending to be someone he trusts or representing someone he trusts.

{"text":"We hear about them all the time. \"Hackers.\" They break into computers at banks, universities, and military bases. Microsoft posts patches for their software regularly to keep them out. They've broken into the Pentagon, they've reportedly taken a British military satellite hostage, and they were spies for the Soviets during the Cold War. They're a threat to global peace and the global economy.\n\nThey could be your next door neighbor's twelve-year-old kid. Or your own.\n\nBefore the media got hold of it, the term \"hacker\" was an accolade, a recognition of someone with superior computer skills. Television and newspapers have turned the term into a digital demon, someone who takes over computers and uses them to rob banks and steal military secrets. We prefer the term \"system cracker\" for these individuals.\n\nWhat are these \"system crackers\" actually capable of?\n\nMost of them simply exploit holes in the security of common Unix-based systems. These holes are well-known and well-documented, and the patches to fix them are easy to find. The only reason these people get in is that someone is too busy (or lazy) to keep up with the security issues as they're identified. With the explosion in popularity of the Internet, there has been a great deal more awareness of this problem, and the system cracker is finding it much more difficult to operate -- but those who do are generally the most skilled, and the most dangerous, of the bunch.\n\nUntil recently, this group has been made up almost entirely of teenage boys, whose purpose was simply to prove themselves and see what they could get away with: a digital version of joyriding. Reports indicate that this is changing; the majority are now older, and their purposes are more monetary, stealing information for themselves or to sell to other corporations, or holding it for ransom. In one widely-reported (but possibly apocryphal) case, a cracker was said to have hijacked a British military satellite and held it for ransom.\n\nWhile they can be dangerous, this group is kept mostly in check by the hundreds of system programmers and system administrators who do battle with them every day. The press these system crackers receive when they're successful is proof itself that these successes are unusual -- if they weren't, they wouldn't be news.\n\nScript Kiddies?\n\n\"Script Kiddies\" is the name given to unskilled system-cracker (or virus-writer) wannabe's who rely on tools (\"scripts\") written by more skilled crackers. Though they wish otherwise, they are mostly harmless, not even qualifying as a mild annoyance to anyone who has kept up with security patches. They rely on the fact that if you look at enough systems, you're going to find a few that are vulnerable.\n\nWhat about pirates?\n\nPirates are fairly benign as a group, at least by comparison to serious system crackers. They limit themselves to simply stealing popular software, and perhaps distributing it to others, often giving it away for free. When and if they're caught, they argue that they aren't depriving anyone of anything, since they're simply making copies of software, not taking it away from anyone, and the people they give it to wouldn't buy it anyway. Some provide sophisticated arguments claiming that they are actually helping the software industry in one way or another. We don't have the information to dispute them -- we doubt anyone does at this point -- but we have to point out that stealing is generally agreed to be wrong, no matter who it does or does not hurt.\n\nPirates are a law-enforcement problem, and there's not much anyone can do about them right now except to avoid their \"wArEz\" and try to get the law to recognize the issue. Major software companies seem to have an unspoken agreement that, since they can't do much more than inconvenience these people with CD-keys and such, they'll just ignore them.\n\nBut there is one other group, the ones who take it upon themselves to supply the pirates with much of their software. This group generally preys on the smaller software houses and individual programmers who release \"demo\" or \"shareware\" versions of their programs. These are the program crackers.\n\nProgram crackers?\n\nThese are the people (usually technically skilled, if morally questionable) who get shareware and demo programs and \"crack\" their protections, usually by altering the programs, or taking them apart to see how they work and then creating bogus registration keys. Very few people have even noticed them -- mostly the individual software authors and small companies who are being ripped off by them, and few of those have the resources necessary to adequately protect their work.\n\nWell-known or not, this is the weak point in the software-piracy chain -- if the program cracker can't bypass a program's protections, the pirate can't distribute it. And with the easing of legal restrictions on powerful encryption, and higher awareness of technical issues, programs can now be protected from all but the most persistent of program crackers.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe Silicon Realms Toolworks noticed the issue after our first product, Silicon Realms MultiDesk, was \"cracked\" twice in the first weeks of its existence. We were not happy about this, and began researching the techniques that made program cracking possible. Our solution became a new product: The SoftwarePassport Software Protection System.\n\nSoftwarePassport protects software by wrapping it in an armored digital \"security envelope,\" preventing unauthorized changes to the software and keeping prying electronic eyes out of your code. It also gives you a complete ready-made registration system with keys that cannot be forged, if you choose to use it. As an added bonus, SoftwarePassport compresses your program, usually making it smaller and often faster to load, and adds other abilities as well, such as automatic network licensing. It's easy to use, requires no changes to your program, and works with any language that produces 32-bit or 64-bit Windows EXE files.\n\nIf you're a program author, or you know someone who is, we recommend you check it out. It's released under the shareware concept, which means you can try it for free, and only buy it if you think it's worth the money we're asking.\n\nWe believe that SoftwarePassport will help keep the computer industry running smoothly for the businesses and individual programmers who will shape the industry in years to come. We hope you will agree."}

I am using the places like the Netherlands and Finland, where education, their economy, civil rights, crime are all in a better position than our own.\" I'm meaning a state that gives money and supplies to its citizens. While it might work in the short term, usually it doesn't give as many people the inspiration to work harder. Further, the more a government is involved, the more complicated something can become. It is hard to keep a government efficient (and keep the people running it from trying to expand their own power, and because of that, the government's).\n\n\"No. Nationalism is not good because it makes people irrational. People ought to think on the meta level. Not 'What is good for the country' but rather 'what is good for mankind?'\"\n\nThe problems is that can be hard to determine. Say one barbaric government doesn't care about idealistic \"care for mankind\" goals (of course, patriotism is idealistic too, but a bit easier to grasp) and invades another country, which does care more about \"all of mankind.\" Should they immediately surrender and subject themselves to the invaders armies so as not to cause trouble for mankind?\n\nPeople are not just going to be nice to everyone.\n\n\".\"\n\nChurches (at least most) don't take, but receive. The government takes and gives\/wastes (because they can), churches receive and help if possible (because the people who visit want to give and help the church). Churches also give to missions and charities. You seem to just focus on \"the occasional garage sale or soup kitchen volunteers\", but many (includes ours) do more.\n\n\"it supports ignorance and intolerance\"\n\nThere is more to many churches than money and faith. You probably only notice the fake preacher who try and convince people to give money (of which, quite a bit helps himself). Christian churches often work in the background...showing off and broadcasting isn't supported by the Bible.\n\n\"Socialism if we maintain a monetary system. Otherwise I would prefer a bartering-free society where resources belong to a collective rather than individuals.\"\n\nI bet it would not take long for any central authority to get filled with corruption.\n\n\"That is for various reasons. Everyone agrees that our schools are awful, but whether the government runs them or not is irrelevant. Besides, the academic environment is what is most concerning. The witch hunt for biology teachers and logic is appalling.\"\n\nI heard an interesting presentation which showed the home schoolers are often better educated. Maybe it is because their parents are able to care for them.\n\nPrivate schools have a better environment than public schools, on average, I would think.\n\n\".\"\n\nHa, good luck with that. I wonder if you are infected with a case of \"the grass looks greener on the other side of the fence\". The more power the government has, the worse it will get (maybe not in the short-term, as it might take time for more corruption and bureaucracy to spread).\n\nWe voters can control the main figureheads and people in power (Congress, the pres, governors), but there are tons of people who can't be easily discovered and kicked out. Besides, the views of common citizens change quickly.\n\nOur government does need changing (especially the pres and his economic advisers), but I'm not sure what this \"anti-US\" feeling is for.\n\nOr...maybe you are a terrorist. Hm do think so. With the amount of corporations and the USA government they've ****ed off so far, they probably have the FBI hot on their tails and it's only a matter of time before they are finally caught.\n\nRegardless of what everyone thinks proxies, vpn's and hell even botnets aren't entirely foolproof for concealing identities. Even if it's a botnet, those zombie computers have to call home or the \"botmaster\" then it becomes a matter of tracking the person or persons responsible for the server was purposely saying something absurd, partly because his posts so far could have been interpreted as supporting terrorism. \"Anti-US\"? \"Anti-patriotism\"? Anti-status-quo?\n\nBesides, he could easily be \"terrorizing\" anyone who is debating with him. Telling people to forget about their religion and country and \"be friends with all mankind\" might make some uncomfortable.\n\nP.S. ... good luck on uniting mankind, unless we are faced with some major obvious external threat or goal. Like aliens.\n\nIf I were the US govt I'd be asking for my money back from Mr Vontz and also asking him WTF was he doing and why the F wasn't the site secure maybe they should send Mr Vontz for a short holiday to a certain interrogation camp ( Guantanamo )\n\nFor once I hope the government wastes tax-payers' dollars on find these kids and prosecuting them\n\nThat kind of thinking is exactly why the US is turning into a tyrannical state and losing money at the same time. Guess who's winning all the tax payer's dollars? The corporations. Guess where they are going to run to when the US is all raped and thrown into the garbage? China, India, etc.\n\nGet it through your head. The US has 14 ****ing trillion dollars in debt. You can't get into a worse situation than that.\n\n\"upcoming group of people intent on testing the integrity of an organisation's digital security\" - haha that's like calling car thieves 'a group of people intent on testing the security of vehicles' thus forcing car makers to improve...\n\nDoesn't matter how much a sys admin is paid - with 0 day exploitz you can be patch-o-lockdown-o-God and still 'get owned'.\n\nPS Did I mention how much Neowin has turned into a tabloid site these days? Neobond - shame on you! ;-)\n\nAssuming that LulzSec doesn't do anything malicious, then aren't they doing the government a service? I mean better to be hacked and expose weakness, than hacked and expose critical documents...\n\nHaven't they stolen sensitive data and posted it? I would think that constitutes criminal activity and would be enough to prosecute them. I also believe hacking, blackhat hacking is illegal according to various cybercrime laws.\n\nHaven't they stolen sensitive data and posted it? I would think that constitutes criminal activity and would be enough to prosecute them. I also believe hacking, blackhat hacking is illegal according to various cybercrime laws.\n\nI don't know what they stole. If they stole incidental data (eg. an 'out of order' sign) then I would consider that to be harmless, and 'useful' hacking (ie. exposing an SQL injection weakness or something). Another group could have used the same exploit to steal valuable and dangerous data.\n\nThis DDoS garbage (see MC\/EVE) they have been doing to other sites is just pointless and childish. That I do believe they should be locked up for.\n\nIf you see an unlocked door, do you open it and take whatever is inside?\n\nNo, you don't. It's the same thing here. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.\n\n\"While the LulzSec group aren't particularly great fans of the United States government, they appear to have not revealed any information that would be of any particular use or interest to a computer user\/political enthusiast.\"\n\nDid I really had to add \"\/sarcasm\"? Your data isn't safe just because you know where you put it. And I can provide more examples by the recent hacking news. Your data is never really safe online. The only way to keep it safe, is to bury it in a ground locked in a safe. But that's too much of a bother for \"my\" login information to pron.com\n\nSecond, no. I don't have a PSN account, but for the sake of the point. I would KNOW that I placed my financial information there, but yet it is not secure. Probably a more personal example, my Amazon credit card. I KNOW they have my SSN, but if a data security breech occurs, it is still compromised.\n\nYour fallacy is that you are making a non sequitur. Whether someone has the knowledge of where their data is does not make it safe. That is like saying that because you know where your house is that therefore it is theft proof. Or that if you know where you parked your car, you don't have to lock it.\n\nprobably.. they dont want to steal ur CC info, they just want to prove a point! if they want to use ur info, they wouldnt tell everyone that they got it, giving u a chance to cancel it all and order a new card.\n\nI mean I wish that hackers like this would go about it more diplomatically, but at least it was these guys and not an actual terrorist organization that could do intense damage. These types of security holes are unacceptable, handle your **** government.\n\nGood on them, if and when they do get caught I just hope that the government gives them a job at the end of it, because hopefully they would of sacked their security people, thus a job position becoming available.\n\nGood on them, if and when they do get caught I just hope that the government gives them a job at the end of it, because hopefully they would of sacked their security people, thus a job position becoming available.\n\nWhy does everyone say we should reward criminals by giving them jobs? That's so stupid. As if there aren't many talented programmers out there who actually contribute to society instead of breaking the law who could really use those jobs. Yes a lot of security people should be fired, but give the jobs to good people who need them and not wastes of oxygen like lulzsec.\n\nTRC - I say hire them because there clearly better than the current security people they have employed. Give them a full time job and get them back in society the correct and legal way. I doubt there's no stopping them, but if they were hired then they could do 'real' good work."}

Though the focus of the conference is security exploits and how to fix them, researchers from the University of Washington will be bringing with them 'Control-Alt-Hack,' the computer security card game.\n\nWith mechanics from Steve Jackson and funding from Intel, the NSF, and the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education, the game is designed to impart some real information to players, but most importantly be fun. Players work for the company Hackers, Inc. which performs security audits and acts as a security consultant. As an employee, they are given different challenges, such as disrupting a hotel minibar's radio-tag payment system, and then telling the manager. (A real exploit related to hotel keycard systems will also be presented at the conference.)\n\nThe target audience for this game is between the ages of 15 and 30 years old, with some familiarity with computer science. You don't have to be a computer scientist to play or even be all that knowledgeable of computer security.

After several months of hitting underground bulletin\nboard systems (flame it, baby), hanging out at 2600 meetings\n(lesssons in paranoia), getting access to internet (jack into the\nmatrix...), dumpstering trash from IL Bell (dumpster nation!),\nbuilding and using red boxes (free fone fun), and various other\nsundry pasttimes, i've started to get a feel of what the hacker-\nphreak community is like, and what possibilities and dangers\ncyberspace has to offer...\nI decided to have this conversation with Lvx and Sarlo, so\nyou and i could get an idea of how joe hacker sees things...\nWind Chill Factor: So define Hacking & Phreaking in your own\nview.\nSarlo: Basically exploration. Hacking is more computer-oriented,\nthe exploration of computer networks, learning about computer\nsoftware, learning how to manipulate it, changing it to fit our\nneeds. Phreaking is the exploration of the telephone system,\nsignalling, how to manipulate so we can jump to other circuits.\nThe phone network & the computer network are becoming one,\ntelephones & computers are now basically the same thing. And\nwe're just trying to learn as much about it as we can, trying to\nget something for nothing.\nLvx: I'd say free phone calls is a big factor in phreaking,\nbecause, as it stands now, calling anyone not in your little part\nof the world is incredibly expensive. The actual manipulation of\nthe phone system has fallen under the Hacking heading...\nWCF: Well, why did you get into it?\nSarlo: When i first started, i saw it as a real cool thing where\ni could get into & see things that other people normally couldn't\nusing the phone system.\nLvx: Getting something for nothing. We can use things that other\npeople generally can't use cuz they dont have the right mindset.\nThey don't get the opportunity...they never find out about all\nthe little scams you can pull to get phree stuff. To really\nhack, you have to go against established norms of\nbehavior...especially with regards to \"property\". So, people who\nare already supposed to doing unacceptable things, namely more\nsubversive and criminal individuals, get into it...\nWCF: What do you think 2600 is trying to do with these public\nmeetings?\nSarlo: Get people together & allow them to finally connect a face\n& a voice to the words they see on the screen, plus to let people\nrealize they don't have to hide behind a computer screen or a\ntelephone. They can actually come out there & meet each other &\nnot have to worry perpetually about being raided, as has been the\ncase recently.\nLvx: It's sort of a way to thumb our nose at authority and say\n\"We're not afraid of you. What we do is not wrong!\"\nWCF: Do you think there is a H-P \"community\"? It seems there's\nsome polarization, with some being in it for money, others for\nscamming (Code Kidz!), and most for the exploration and learning.\nBut can anyone, like, say there is a hacker \"ethic\"?\nLvx: Community! Ha! Too many folx in it for the notoriety,,,not\nthe subject matter. Ethic, tho? Sure! But, no one claims they\never truly follow that ethic. It's sort of a medeley: learning\nhow to scam, exploration to learn, etc. There is little money in\nhacking. I was personally just offered money to hack into a\ncompany's computers...however, since the company does not\ninterest me, and since i don't believe in taking money for what i\ndo anyway (not to mention receiving money to commit a\nfelony...entrapment city), the ethic comes into play. In this\ncase it is sort of a backwards thing...but, in general, there is\na hacking ethic. It sez: get in, play around, but don't damage,\nand don't profit. The learning is all, ya see. In the case of\ngetting calls for free---a very dark grey area. Technically,\nit's profitting, but since it's at the expense of the Phone\nNazis, it evens out. They rob from us, we rob from them--it all\ncomes out ok conceptually.\nSarlo: Yes, in most cases, its something inbred in us--don't\ndestroy information, don't gain monetarily from the information\nfound, and of course, \"yield to the hands on imperative!\"\nWhenever possible, USE the machine, don't just read about it!\nWCF: Would you say 2600 is about info-sharing? If so, why aren't\nthe meetings organized more towards skill-sharing? People seem\nto let the paranoia rule the meetings...\nLvx: No, not at this stage. The kind of info you can share is\nthe kind of info that will get you busted--a public disclosure is\ngenerally not a smart move. The skill-sharing sort of happens,\nbehind the scenes. It is difficult to explain hi-brow advanced\nconcepts to people who lack a solid (if any at all) background in\nthe subject. And, relying on elementary skills becomes tiring\nfor the teacher (who often has little skill in teaching) to\nrattle off and the student to digest. There is a wealth of\nlearning materials free for the taking (or stealing) about\ncomputers in general...in a basic sense. It is the advanced\ntopics that are hard to find about...and that is what gets kicked\naround between the players that can understand it.\nSarlo: The meetings are based on total freedom--there's no\nagenda, no formal speakers (usually, this may change soon,\nhowever). The information sharing usually takes place after the\nmeetings, in private discussion. But the meetings also provide a\nhuman side for what we do. We see each other as text across the\nscreen. Its great to see faces to the name. But as for the\nspreading of information, we often forget what its like for\nsomeone to begin, or at least i do, and i tend not to actively\nshove the info in their faces. But if they choose to come up and\nask how to start, what are good places to check out, etc., then i\ndoubt you will find anyone more willing to give you the\ninformation, or if we don't have it, where you might find it, but\nthey have to make an effort as well. Besides. Nobody ever went\nto jail for being paranoid.\nWCF: Do hackers & phreaks, or the people involved in 2600 see\nthemselves in opposition to big brother, the government, the\ncorporations?\nSarlo: I dont think its so much institutions, like the govt or\ncorps, so much as its an idea they hold. Our idea is that\ninformation should be free, that information shouldn't only be\ngiven out to a select few. A company believes that when they\nstamp confidential on a document, then the person who may come in\ncontact with it has agreed with the company that they won't\ndisclose the information, that it's private. Well, we've made no\nsuch agreement.\nLvx: Well i think that by necessity, yes, we are in opposition\nbecuz information is turning into this same property thing where\npeople try to OWN it. I personally don't see it that way--how\ncan it be property when information isn't even physical? I don't\nknow, the whole hacking thing is kind of opening up the door so\nthat it goes out rather than in for profit.\nSarlo: Security is a joke. Intellectual property just a\nhandjob.\nWCF: I've heard talk about using technology to decentralize the\ncontrol over information, but don't you think it only\ndecentralizes it to the people who have access to it? Access to\nthat technology?\nLvx: Information, in the useful sense, is a lot like heinz 57\nsauce. You can't keep it bottled up. It never gets used up, and\nit keeps getting copied (thru brainz or otherwise), so eventually\neven the most carefully guarded secrets get spread around. A\ngood library, for instance, has an incredible amount of\ninformation about almost everything. Technology moves that\ninformation into a more user-oriented mode...the hard part of\nsearching and finding is done for you by computer..to your specs.\nWCF: Do you see technology as aiding citizen participation in so-\ncalled democracy? Like TVs were originally supposed to have been\nused for?\nLvx: No. It might help people make more informed decisions, but I\nthink as a whole democracy is going to hell. Soon.\nWCF: So, in terms of communication thru nets, don't you see a\ndanger in them being created and sustained by corps & govts?\nInternet was started by the Dept. of Defense, right? In the\nfuture, do you see them tightening their control over these nets?\nLvx: IRC [Internet Relay Channel] is maintained by no one. It's\na self-serve thing. As for internet...it has evolved far beyond\nthe makers hopes (and wants). No one controls internet. It is a\nsymbiosis...information creators and info carriers.\nWCF: I have here an article by Feral Faun on the \"Cybernet of\nDomination\", which argues that these new forms of tehnology which\nsupposedly \"decentralize\" power and promote direct democracy and\nhave the appearance of being liberating, are actually a more\nsubtle form of social control. Already the cybernet permeates\nour homes, workplaces, schools, hang-outs...\nLvx: Yep, and it will never go away. Control it, or be\ncontrolled thru it.\nSarlo: Well one thing i personally would like to see is\neverybody in the world having access to computers. But everybody\ngoes \"Oh no, oh no my god! This is horrible, we're going to have\ncommie people in here!...\"\nLvx: It also seems that this central control is not just one big\nsprawling thing...its decentralized, there is no single final\nauthority or group of authorities. Even the manufacturers have\nto get together to compromise on standards to maintain\ncompatibility...\nSarlo: That's the whole thing about the network.\nLvx: There's so many networks...\nWCF: I think what its saying by control is that you have to\nparticipate in the network in order to work within and take\nadvantage of it...so you're bound by the network.\nLvx: Nah, you can expand it easily. Just look at your mailing\nlist for anarchy [the anarchy-list]...that is a network in and of\nitself. It's not about control its just another medium...\nSarlo: What we're looking at is not so much control over...well\nthere is control over access but a lot of it nowadays is social\ncontrol. There's all these special interest groups that are\nself-important, that want a say in where the industry\ngoes...there was a forum for Harpers Magazine on a computer\nsystem called the Well. It was originally created to be a kind\nof town hall forum, a free speech thing...\nLvx: Run by older hippies.\nWCF: The electronic town hall idea is a way some people have put\nforward as a way to make democracy more direct..everyone have a\ncomputer and communicate through your computer.\nSarlo: What Ross Perot wanted to do. But the way he wanted it\nset up, you could only hit 1 for yes, there was no no option. If\nyou said no it wouldnt allow you to voice your opinion...\nLvx: How are you going to get 250 million people with computers?\nThat's an impossible logistics task, but also you wouldnt be able\nto talk at the same time. Everyone voicing their opinion is just\ntoo much noise. And i dont think that that sort of \"democracy\"\ncould really exist, except in principle.\nSarlo: We have what, 32 billion people in the US...if Ross Perot\never got power and put a system like that into effect, the\ntemptation to change or delete the messages, in effect squelch\nthe american public...theres no doubt in my mind, the same goes\nfor Clinton. Abuse of power.\nWCF: It seems that already happens today.\nSarlo: Yeah, to an extent.\nLvx: Doing it on computers would be even more lame.\nWCF: This kinda relates to another criticism of electronic\ndirect-democracy...that while it may help facilitate-control\ndecision making (albeit with the usual separation of decision and\naction), the system itself cannot be questioned because it\ncontrols the questioning. Its like voting, you can vote for this\ngovernment or that govt, but you cant choose an alternative to\ngovt by the nature of the process.\nLvx: Agreement here. Just a facade of self-determination.\nFreedom of Choice is no freedom at all.\nWCF: When your choices are limited...Well, coming from the\nanarchist perspective, there's a lot of questioning technology,\nand a fundamental question is is technology neutral? Obviously\ncomputer networks can be used and in terms of hacking taken\nadvantage of...but isn't that even only partially offsetting the\noverall negative impact of these networks, as they're used by\ncorps and govts to fuck people over?\nSarlo: They use us as scapegoats to say \"Oh, we have to tighten\nsecurity so we have to look thru your mail to make sure your not\ndoing something wrong.\" Big Brother. Anybody who says that big\nbrother doesn't exist is either part of the conspiracy or isn't\npaying attention. Look at the IBM building downtown. There's\ncameras all around the building. Why?\nLvx: What do they have to hide?\nSarlo: Not that so much as why are they so interested in the\npeople walking down the street for? The potential for abuse by\nour side--which i'm not going to say hasn't happened--people have\ndisconnected phone lines on a whim (ahem)--there have been people\nlike that on our side...but the govt also uses us as an excuse to\nintrude on everybody elses privacy.\nWCF: Everybody \"else\"?\nSarlo: The common people. They listen in on your phone\nconversations. When you make an international call, there's a\ncomputer that listens in on the call for key words: drugs, guns,\nterrorism, assassination, president...i mean they listen for\nthose words and when they hear them they'll just start recording\nyour conversation..then that recording goes to the NSA, the NSA\ntakes the info and determines what department it should go to, if\nit should go to the FBI, etc. It may take months but it still\ngets filed and goes to an organization.\nLvx: Yeah, i see what you mean by how tech is used to control but\ni don't know, it's mostly because there's people with the\nresources to design it & implement and they get it first. This\nhi tech started with people with lots of money, lots of power,\nlots of resources, and they'll always stay one step ahead. You\ncan buy a PC now for real cheap but you can't buy the cutting\nedge real cheap because it's not for you. Look at radar\ndetectors. The tech becomes obsolete once it's in wide use, and\nthe same company is marketing a new product.\nSarlo: Talk about companies, they're 6 generations ahead with\nmicrochip technology, they just won't release it, it's a\nmarketing ploy. They wait 6 months for everybody to get\nsomething and then say \"Oh, that's obsolete now, get this\". And\ni dont even need the newest thing on the market i just need\nsomething that suffices for now.\nLvx: What can i do argue that technology is not used to control?\nLots of things about it are evil...\nSarlo: Like a knife, it can be used as a tool to carve something\nout or to kill someone. It all depends on how it's used.\nLvx: But the people with the biggest power and resources make the\nbiggest knives and can use them the best.\nWCF: So you kind of see your role in society to be keeping\nOrwellian police-state society in check.\nSarlo: Not even so much in check so long as i'm able to keep\nmyself and my friends outta trouble and let them know whats going\non...i dont really feel an allegiance to the rest of the world\nwhere i feel i must let everybody know that this Orwellian future\nisn't just fiction. It's a dark future. Technology is going to\nbe abused by both sides. I see all these people who drop acid,\ndo shrooms and read Mondo 2000 and think computers are going to\nbe the greatest thing on earth. It's going to be this magical\nsuperb thing and the thing is it's just not going to be.\nWCF: Actually a big section of the Green Movement, of all people,\ndoes see technology as being useful in stopping eco-destruction\nand making society more democratic. Kind of a green techno-\nutopia.\nLvx: I am suspicious of the word utopia. It implies some sort of\nplatonic ideal, and as we all know, plato just plagiarized\nsocrates.\nWCF: Well do you see this as a losing battle then?\nSarlo: Not so much a losing battle as a battle that can't ever be\nwon by either side.\nWCF: So do you see the future becoming a police state or social\nchaos?\nLvx: The world's not getting any bigger and the population's not\ngetting any smaller and we can't seem to control it. The more\npeople the more things get fucked up. I can't see a police\nstate--they hate each other, the FBI, police, CIA...they work\ntogether but they each try to sabotage one another. The security\nforces have rebelled and have their own agendas now.\nWCF: How about nation states breaking down? That's common in\ncyberpunk fiction. Will technological decentralization lead to\nstate decentralization? Look at Eastern Europe right now,\nRussia, Bosnia. Already states seem to be getting more and\nsubdivided. Often along ethnic, tribal lines.\nLvx: I hope so. I want the nation of Lvx...a nation of one...I\nfigure most decisions would be unanimous!\nWCF: Tell me about information services.\nSarlo: There's a service called Information On America which is\nbasically a database on every single person in america. If\nyou've ever filled out a form, it'll provide your home address,\nphone #, phone bills, payments, info on up to 10 of your\nneighbors...\nWCF: Who has access to it?\nSarlo: It's $95 an hour to anybody. Some hackers have learned\nhow to crack the system however.\nLvx: It's like Big Brother's subcontractor. There's so many info\nservices. It's mostly info gathered for marketing.\nWCF: In other countries people will refuse to take the census but\nin this country there is more control, there is more technology.\nCredit card records show everything you've bought, phone\ncompanies know everybody you call...\nSarlo: It's getting so you can't wipe yer ass without some agency\nknowing you're doing it.\nLvx: And what the breakdown of yer feces is.\nWCF: Something interesting too is like the Museum of Science &\nIndustry here in Chicago, like every little section they have is\nsponsored by some company that has an interest in pushing that\ntopic. Like there's a big thing about petroleum and how great it\nis--sponsored by Amoco. Nothing about the Exxon Valdez or going\nto war for oil. They have really simplistic info, a lot of\npacked truths...\nSarlo: I've occasionally gone to the Illinois Bell section at the\nmuseum and passed out flyers about red boxes and how to make\nthem. A museum is nothing more than a big cultural conditioning\nstore.\nWCF: Besides D.C. and the Bellcore incident, what other kinds of\npressure has 2600 gotten?\nLvx: I think there's been some random incidents of harrassment,\njust people getting raided, and when people get raided especially\nby the SS, your stuff gets confiscated, no charges get\nfiled...it's not so much to prosecute so much as to harass you\nand develop scare tactics...\nSarlo: Boards containing \"anarchist\" material on creating\nexplosives have been shut down for threatening social\ndisruption...\nWCF: A lot of \"anarchist\" material on bbs's that i've seen has\nbeen stupid chaos i-wanna-be-anarchy-blow-shit-up stuff, but\nthere's also a fair bit of radicalism and anarchist influence.\nLvx: Sucks, doesn't it? It's a matter of public opinion. In the\nopinion of the public, anarchy=bombs & guns.\nWCF: On the 2600 teleconference the other day i was talking to 2\nhackers who were in the military, and i was thinking on one hand\nthey work for the govt but on the other hand their hobby is\nsomething the govt finds criminal...\nLvx: Maybe they're saying you can work for the govt but still be\nagainst it?\nSarlo: It's the same thing with telephone company employees.\nCommmunications workers are getting fired left and right & the\nway they're being treated...and it's gettinng easier and easier\nto get into their computers! You can ask them for their password\nand say \"Yeah, i'm a hacker\" and they'll give it to ya!\nLvx: Yeah, lots of phone company employees really hate the phone\ncompany.\nSarlo: And that's something--a lot of computer crime is committed\nby disgruntled employees...\nWCF: You've said before that the Tribune wanted to interview you\nbut you refused. Why, and what do you think of the media's\nportrayal of hackers?\nSarlo: Newspapers will try to make things be as interesting as\npossible. Well, hackers can do cool things but...they say we\nbreak into credit agencies, find out all this info, shut down\nphone services...well, what they never point out is, yeah, we can\ndo this but why shut things down? We're hackers not\ncriminals...they never point out that we're out exploring. News\nis a lot of sensationalism, society gets off on negative things,\nand exploration is really unexciting especially in the realm of\ncomputers.\nWCF: What do you think about tech being used in warfare on other\ncountries? Like the supposed virus the US allegedly fed to iraqi\ncomputers to crash their air defences. Sarlo, you have a pretty\nindividualistic approach to using tech to defend yourself, but\nwhat about you, Lvx? Are you a hero of the revolution?\nLvx: Well i'd protect anyone from it. I'm kinda the helpful\nsort, but yeah that kind of stuff sickens me. The government\ncouldn't field any decent talent in the way of hacking. Hacking\nis an expression of defiance against the law, government is based\non law. No good hacker could work for the man.\nWCF: How would you suggest someone get started at hacking?\nSarlo: Buy a computer.\nLvx: Or steal a computer.\nSarlo: Rule #1 is get access. Or just start dialing numbers,\npick an obscure prefix (the first 3 numbers) and just start\ndialing from 0000 to 9999. You'll find a lot of really\ninteresting things usually from in prefix 99 and from 9900 to\n9999.\nLvx: I started by going to the library and picking up some books,\nfirst on digital switching. It might not make any sense at first\nbut just start playing around. Most of my starter info i got\ncompletely legally.\nSarlo: Things have changed tho, if you start asking questions\nabout digital switching or ISDN, you'll get the hairy eyeball.\nUnless you're well known in telecom circles, if you start asking\nquestions about how certain tones work or anything people won't\ntrust you.\nLvx: And i think it's a damn shame, we're all supposed to have\nphones and computers without knowing the secret workings...\nSarlo: It's all completely mindless. When you scan numbers, the\ntelephone central office just goes nuts, they go \"What the hell\nare you doing? Why are you scanning these prefixes? You\nshouldn't be doing this! Don't explore! You'll break our phone\nsystem!\" It shouldn't cost 5 cents a minute to call 3 miles away\neither.\nLvx: There's so many things, stuff you're not ever supposed to\nfind out, like where their operations are at. Their central\noffices are set up like fortresses--steel doors, cameras, you\nhave to phone in to gain entry...I can see wanting to protect\nfrom random stuff, i mean it is everyones phone network even tho\nIllinois Bell thinks its theirs...and it's all fucked up...It's a\nfact of life now...not a luxury!\nSarlo: I don't think phone bills should exist, i think once we\nhave a technology that's so integrated that we practically can't\nlive without it then things need to be changed...electricity,\ngas, water,...this country needs an overhaul.\nLvx: I totally agree. If it's a necessity, i can see charging a\nlittle to provide for costs, but...pay for upkeep, pay for\nadvances, but not so rich wanks can pad the ole portfolio.\nSarlo: It's just profiteering gluttons serving themselves.\nWCF: Where's 2600 going?\nSarlo: Word is getting out, it's really easy to set up a meeting.\nThe thing to remember about 2600 meetings is there's no rules,\nthat's what's really cool about this network of computers where\npeople communicate without racial bias, without gender, yer just\njudged by who you are & what you do, how you act...and we have\ncorporations and govt coming in and saying what we can and\ncannnot do. They're going to regulate everything. Why do credit\nrating companies even have info on whether you're white or black,\nwhy should it matter?\nWCF: You have to admit that computers are still mostly used by\nwhite, male, middle class types. And i've seen lots of sexism on\nbbs's, which are mostly playgrounds for boys it seems. And i've\nseen bbs's with racist material--right-wingers use the nets too.\nLvx: Yep, gotta have money and an introduction to play. I'll be\nthe last person to deny that BBS's are lame. A great majority\nare just little playgrounds. Occasionally, there are decent\nforums where actual OPINIONS and IDEAS are argued rather than\nchildish insults...and it is these few places that make it semi-\nworthwhile.\nWCF: So while hackers are eager for equality in the net, why\ndon't they fight for equal acces to the net?\nLvx: We do. Every time you steal an account, you increase access\nto the net. If you want in, you have to grab it. When you crawl\nto Papa Gore and say \"Oh, please, can we have access to the\nfuture?\", the reply is \"Of course! Money permitting! If no one\nminds!\" with an unsaid \"On our terms, where we let you, when we\nlet you, and with us watching every step. \"Access for all\" means\naccess to little, if any at all.\nWCF: Do you feel dealing with just a computer for communication\nis dehumanizing? Its much more impersonal than direct contact,\nand look at the tendency of people to \"flame up\".\nLvx: Not any more than the telephone. Text communication allows\nmore thought to be taken in how you reply to things...some people\njust don't take that time...\nSarlo: Not so much dehumanizing as treating people as\nindividuals...sort of like 2600 meetings are big but not\ngigantic, and they still allow people to be individuals. On the\ncomputer, if you log on and you see lots of people on there--its\nwords. It's not just words so much as ideas and peoples actions.\nAnd people on computers produce real tangible results. I think\none of our greatest vulnerabilities to computers is our reliance\non them. We rely on them blindly. We assume they're always\ngoing to be there. Our reliance on technology is going to be our\ndownfall. Computers are great to explore and all...but look at\npeople and television. Hell, they can't even change a channel\nwithout a remote control and can't even figure out how to hook up\nthe vcr...\nLvx: Technology being used even as a convenience that other\npeople can control--and they know how to, and they have all the\nspecs, all the ins and outs, but they don't want to let anyone\nelse to know the ins and outs, cuz that would empower them.\nSarlo: Look at how manuals are written...incredible\nbureaucracy...virtually no way to right off the bat understand it\nall. They make it so that they can keep the common person in\ncheck, so that they suddenly don't come up with the inspiration\nto create something. They want to monopolize it.\nLvx: Information as property, this is mine, you can't know it.\nSarlo: Intellectual property is a joke. The idea that you can go\nto prison for looking at a document is absurd. I've learned\nsecurity holes out of necessity because i want to learn how to\nuse the computers, but i could live quite comfortably without any\ntype of security, being able to log right in i would love it.\nThe only problem with security i see is enormous databases like\nTRW & Info On America, where info is being harmfully abused. I'm\ntotally against the amassing of that kind of data anyways. If\nyou break into TRW and look at your own credit report, you're in\nviolation of law, but they can amass all this info on you without\nyour permission and sell it to other people.\nWCF: Do you think elite BBS's are necessary? Are you \"elite\"\nenough?\nLvx: I am so 3leeT it hurts. There will always be a separation\nbetween the tourists and the dwellers. Computers are not without\nrisks...so until one can individually make progress, it is\npointless to give out sensitive information. You don't let\nchildren play with the guns until they know what the guns can do.\nWCF: Do you consider \"ego\" to be a problem in the h-p community?\nLvx: Ego ain't so much of a problem once you meet people face to\nface. It kills a lot of the supposed superiority one feels.\nWCF: Are you cyberpunks?!\nLvx: No. I am a technarchist...in the techno, anarchist, and\nnarccistic sense of the word...\nWCF: Any last words?\nLvx: Buy our record.\nThis is of course, just the beginning...we will have more on this\nin future issues, and we encourage those of you who can to use\nthis information and get started...\nGETTING ONLINE\nFirst acquire a computer and modem.

So start your own community TV\nnetwork!\nRED BOXING\nA red box is a device that simulates the tones a quarter makes in\na Bell telephone, thus enabling one to make free, fraudulent,\nlong distance or international phone calls. While we at WCF\nwould never conceive of defrauding Ma Bell, we thought it was\npretty nifty how these things are made, and thought we'd share\nthe info. The easiest way is just to buy yourself a Radio Shack\n33-memory pocket tone dialer (about $25), and a 6.5536 mHz\ncrystal. Open up the tone dialer, and first remove the little\nwhite disk speaker cuz its kinda unneccessary, and you need that\nroom for the new crystal. Then remove the old crystal and attach\nthe new one, using the white speaker wires if you want. Just\nsolder to the spots the old crystal was connected too. Be\ncareful you don't solder them together! Now seal it back up, and\nprogram 5 * (star) buttons into the memory. When you press the\nbutton, it emits tones close enough to simulate the tones you\nneed and fool Ma Bell.\nTIPS FOR USE: First, red boxes only work on Bell phones.\nSecond, they are good for long distance & international calls\nusually. You can sometimes scam a local call by going thru the\nlong distance carrier (dialing 10288-number for example) or by\nasking the operator to dial the call for you. You can also\nprogram dimes (2 stars) and nickels (1 star). Don't abuse the\nsame payphones repeatedly, as you will get them \"adjusted\" or\nworse, get caught. While skimming a bit off of Ma Bell's\nprofits isn't a bad thing, red boxes are first and foremost a\ntool for phreaking--exploration of the phone system. Besides,\noverabuse will just get Bell to switch the systems so red boxes\ndon't work, as is already the case in some parts of NY and CA.\nSo have fun, but be careful.\nMr. Dan Carver, the Grand Wizard of the KKK in Tennesee got a\nsurprise on his phone bill during the month of February.

{"text":"random thoughts on the impact of law and policy on ICT... and vice versa\n\nThursday, March 8, 2012\n\nMoney laundering and data mining\n\nMoney laundering is the act of making it appear that earnings, profit, or income acquired through illegal means have originated from legitimate sources. \"Laundering\" literally means washing clothes or bed linens, so in layman's terms, \"money laundering\" is \"cleaning or disguising dirty money.\" Illegitimate sources of money would include drug trade or trafficking, smuggling of weapons, prostitution, and others. Studies suggest that money laundering is being used to finance terrorist activities, given that in some countries money laundering is not yet considered illegal. (In 2001, the Philippines passed an anti-money laundering law.)\n\nFront-door money laundering involves the use of financial institutions like banks or insurance companies to launder illegally-acquired money. For example, a smuggler can buy a life insurance policy and pay the premium in cash with his \"dirty\" money. Then the policy is surrendered or sold for its cash value, which is now \"clean\" money. Illegal profits are usually disguised in banks by depositing or distributing cash evenly in several bank accounts. Front-door money laundering is usually detected by law enforcement agencies through the cooperation of banks and financial institutions.\n\nHowever, most money laundering is now being done \"back-door\" through abnormal international trade pricing. Money is moved across international borders, and this makes it difficult for law enforcers to pursue and investigate suspected money laundering activities and perpetrators. Back-door money laundering is achieved through overvaluation or undervaluation, the latter being most favored by terrorists because exports of a country are not usually as thoroughly inspected as imports.\n\nGovernment agencies use data mining methods to track back-door money laundering with the help of computer technology. Database applications are used to compare and contrast \"abnormal\" prices and current or standard prices to detect possible cases of money laundering. Abnormal transfer prices between corporations are also detected, as well as other kinds of price deviation. Prices of goods and services going in and out of that country are scrutinized and compared with the standard prices. It is even possible to estimate the amount of illegally-acquired money channeled to and from a country. These are achieved through computer technology."}
{"text":"5. VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) attacks used now to make money by reselling minutes and potentially for injection of misleading messages and even for creating massive outages in the old phone network.\n\nThe press release contains an \"Expert Analysis\" section with a contribution from Rohit Dhamankar, senior manager of security research at TippingPoint, that states:\n\nLast year we saw many remote code execution vulnerabilities in Asterisk, a popular VoIP server that is being used by mid to large size companies. The FBI reports many VOIP systems are being compromised so criminals can sell minutes and leave the bill with the victim. But that's not my major concern.\n\nThe VoIP system marries the IP network with the old-style phone network (SS7). The latter has not been accessible to hackers on an easy basis prior to the VoIP deployments. By compromising a VoIP server, an attacker now has the ability to inject bad messages in the phone network. One may ask, what would that do: The most disastrous consequence can be bringing down the old phone network.\n\nAlthough the 1990 outage was not due to a cyber attack, such an attack is feasible in the near future by controlling a VoIP server.\n\nWhile we all can debate whether a VoIP attack today could actually bring down the PSTN, the potential (however large or minute) is certainly out there and the larger point is that, as we have been saying here for quite some time, there are very real issues within VoIP security that do need to be addressed. Many, if not most, of those issues have solutions or ways to be mitigated, but doing so does involve some work and typically configuration changes, network improvements, etc.\n\nVoIP technology has seen rapid adoption during the past year. At the same time, there has been an increase in security scrutiny of typical components of a VoIP network such as the call proxy and media servers and the VoIP phones themselves. Various products such as Cisco Unified Call Manager , Asterisk and a number of VoIP phones from various vendors have been found to contain vulnerabilities that can either lead to a crash or a complete control over the vulnerable server\/device. By gaining a control over the VoIP server and phones, an attacker could carry out VoIP phishing scams, eavesdropping, toll fraud or denial-of-service attacks.\n\nSince many VoIP servers especially the ones at VoIP service providers are an interface between SS7 (traditional phone signaling) and IP networks, an attacker capable of compromising a vulnerable VoIP server could even potentially manipulate the SS7 signaling interconnection to disrupt services on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).\n\nThe section goes on to list CVEs related to Asterisk and Cisco Call Manager, and then includes a section on ways to mitigate those vulnerabilities. (Which is good input into the VoIP Security Best Practices project we are about to launch.)\n\nIt is great to see SANS putting the spotlight on VoIP, and we within VOIPSA look forward to continuing to work with people all across the industry to both point out the vulnerabilities in VoIP and also to help identify solutions to address the concerns.\n\n5 Responses to \"SANS Top 20 Internet Security Attack Target List for 2006 includes VoIP for the first time\"\n\nI find it very interesting that SANS is now recommending folks run security tools like PROTOS against their VoIP products. This could indicate the beginning of a new level of due diligence in IT shops.\n\nOne of many potential issues concerns the complexity of these fuzzing tools. Aside from setup and running them correctly, there's also the very challenging aspects of determining *exactly* what the attack causing the problem actually was \u2014 for example running these voip fuzzer testcases in different ways (forward, backward, random) can place a device under test in a strange one-off state. An example of this is from the README in the J. Oquendo's recently released Asteroid SIP tool: \n\n\"Anyhow, I have found that by sending a certain sequence of these packets, in a certain order, servers react differently. Sometimes it will\ncrash faster, sometimes more extensions are subscribe, etc, etc. I will not post any sequencing until vendors have patched their programs\nagainst this lame attack but, I will release the packet samples I've been working with.\"\n\nFor those about to embark on this brave new world of customer-done QA, a \"first run\" of SIP tools I'd suggest running against your SIP device is the SIPSAK tool with some of the flooding options, the PROTOS SIP suite, the Asteroid suite, and ISIC (udpsic and tcpsic) against the SIP ports.\n\n[...] Dan York has written a lengthy post on how SANS (SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security) Insitute has identified VoIP among their top 20 Internet Security Threats for 2006.\u00a0They've identified six major trends in Internet security attacks, and VoIP is one of them, primarily via vulnerabilities in systems like Asterisk and Cisco Call Manager.\u00a0[...]"}

But that doesnt mean there are not good people.\nThe people who are ethical should come forward and educate people what a Hacker is tell them a Cyber Criminal is not Hacker. We should come forward and encourage people to change their mind set.\nDo some creative activities in the real world (For example conduct trainings, give seminars about Ethial Hacking). Only after such task the media would also start potrating the good side of \"Hackers\"\n\nYeah media sucks!\ni just dont get why the f*ck they dont use \"black hats\" or \"crackers\" to represent those criminals.\nand no improvement would be seen, as many ethical hackers are busy in cyber war against pak and they do that under the name of \"Hacker\", which is a broad term. they should use term black hat for them selves instead, and remaining ethical guys as you said \"dont care\"\n~sighs~"}
{"text":"I See You Typing\n\nSpying on someone by hacking into his webcam is disturbingly easy. Why don't more people do it?\n\nStill, webcam espionage isn't very common. Most scammers are interested in money, and video of someone's slack-jawed mug isn't going to yield much cash. \"Most stuff you'd capture on a camera, they've already posted on Facebook,\" says Kevin Haley of Symantec Security Response. *Even if you did have hundreds of hours of video and audio capturing someone's conversations, it's a lot harder to index and search than written information. (Some programs solve this problem by activating the camera only if they sense movement.) If it's profit the hacker wants, the contents of the computer are much more valuable than whatever's happening in front of it.\n\nIf someone hacks into a webcam, therefore, it's usually a targeted attack. Pure creepiness is one motivation. A 15-year-old girl in Texas reported in 2004 that a hacker who took over her computer would eject the disk drive and say things like, \"I like your shirt.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there's spying on people you'd like to keep an eye on, such as, say, your spouse. One could see this being useful for private investigators, though PIs I spoke with say they don't know of anyone hacking into webcams as part of their work. \"The technology is there for it to happen,\" says Charles McLaughlin, a PI in Andover, Mass. \"But in the private sector, although there are some characters willing to break the law, most reputable PIs don't.\" You might get away with it if you install the spyware own your own computer\u2014say, the one in the bedroom\u2014but even that gets into shady legal territory.\n\nMore threatening than video is audio. By accessing a computer's microphone, you turn the computer into a bug. It's also more clandestine than video, since the microphone is always on and there's usually no light to tip you off when it's recording. \"The mic thing worries me a lot more,\" says Chris Wysopal of the security firm Veracode. \"Unless you can lip-read, [video alone] isn't that useful.\"\n\nSo how do you prevent someone from spying on you? The usual Internet hygiene applies. Don't click the weird attachment your computer-illiterate relatives send you, update your antivirus software regularly, and so forth. If you want to be really cautious, the best solution is the simplest: Put a piece of tape over the camera. It may be the laptop equivalent of the tinfoil hat, but it's the only way to absolutely guarantee privacy. The microphone is trickier, since you can't tape it up. You can disable it, though, by plugging a converter or some other cord into the computer's microphone jack, which turns off the internal mic.\n\nBut ultimately, there's only so much you can do. Vulnerability is a fact of cyber life: Anytime you open a portal to the outside world, it makes intrusion possible. The problem is when we don't even know the portal exists, or are only dimly aware of it. There's a general rule that you shouldn't write anything in an e-mail that you wouldn't want shared with the world. Perhaps the same should apply to dancing in your underwear while your laptop is watching.\n\nCorrection,April 6, 2009: This article originally misspelled the name of Symantec Security Response.

{"text":"Straight out of DARPA comes technology that enables users to generate trackable, fake documents that include a beacon that report back to the user when they are opened. The app also allows users to upload docs and embed them with beacons.\n\nSo what's the big idea behind the technology? In the wake of the Wikileaks scandal earlier in 2011, the Department of Defense wanted a way to track where documents are going and identify who's opening them. (Note: Nothing in this post -- except the marked URL below -- contains such tracking code.)\n\nThe DARPA-funded technology comes out of Columbia University generating fake PDFs and Word documents for your home computer that'll ping you if they're opened. Taking it for a spin pretty quickly shows some of the problems of the system.\n\nIt's recommended you open the document yourself first to give it the permissions to contact the server so it doesn't alert potential data thieves in the future \u2014 wouldn't that alert still pop up if they pulled up on a different computer? The documents also don't call home from Mac OS, which is fine if you're running a large network of PCs, but not so useful for everyone's home machine.\n\nYou can sign-up and try the app here, but beware it's a little clunky (for example, the demo wasn't working when I signed up) and it doesn't create Word documents. The image above shows how documents can be created.\n\nAccording to the developer:\n\nOnce a user registers with the system by providing a real email address and user chosen passcode, the user is ready to get started. FOG provides a number of tabs to select different actions. The create decoy tab is first used to request the generation of Adobe PDF or MS Word Doc files, each with an enabled \"beacon\" that executes whenever the document is opened. Once the user has generated a document, they may download it to their machine.\n\nThe first time the document is downloaded, we suggest opening the document for review. The user will likely see a security pop-up message warning the user that the document is attempting to make a network connection with a server at the IDS lab at Columbia. The user should click on the box to REMEMBER THIS ACTION, and then click on ALLOW so that subsequently opening the document will not generate a pop-up message (which can be used by an inside attacker to detect the decoy).\n\nThe document should then be stored in a conspicuous location such as the Desktop, or the MY-Documents folder (on Windows machines). In the future, any time the decoy is opened, an email will be sent to the registered email address warning the legitimate user that someone has opened a decoy document in their machine.\n\nThe link below -- which doesn't look even a little stealthy -- has tracking code and will report back to me that it has been clicked. Or it's supposed to. I'll report back.\n\nI am not sure this is something readers would want to use in their organizations, but it is an interesting way to see the ways in which the U.S. government is responding to Wikileaks and other releases of sensitive information."}
{"text":"Some real life scenarios\n\nContinued from last issue, we are analyzing some of the common cyber related crimes from a legal perspective.\n\n6. Source Code Theft\n\nComputer source code is the most important asset of software companies. Simply put, source code is the programming instructions that are compiled into the executable files that are sold by software development companies.\n\nAs is expected, most source code thefts take place in software companies. Some cases are also reported in banks, manufacturing companies and other organizations that get original software developed for their use.\n\nScenario 1:\n\nThe suspect (usually an employee of the victim) steals the source code and sells it to a business rival of the victim He would then contact potential buyers to make the sale.\n\nThe suspect (usually an employee of the victim) steals the source code and uses it as a base to make and sell his own version of the software\n\nHe would then modify the source code (either himself or in association with other programmers) and launch his own software.\n\nMost business organizations store their sensitive information in computer systems. This information is targeted by rivals, criminals and sometimes disgruntled employees.\n\nScenario 1:\n\nA business rival obtains the information (e.g. tender quotations, business plans etc) using hacking or social engineering. He then uses the information for the benefit of his own business (e.g. quoting lower rates for the tender).\n\nUsual motives: Illegal financial gain.\n\nApplicable law\n\nBefore 27 October, 2009\n\nAfter 27 October, 2009\n\nSections 43 & 66 of the Information Technology Act and section 426 of Indian Penal Code\n\nA disgruntled employee steals the information and mass mails it to the victim's rivals and also posts it to numerous websites and newsgroups.\n\nUsual motives: Revenge.\n\nApplicable law\n\nBefore 27 October, 2009\n\nAfter 27 October, 2009\n\nSections 43 and 66 of the Information Technology Act and section 426 of Indian Penal Code\n\nSections 43, 66, 66B of the Information Technology Act and section 426 of Indian Penal Code\n\n8. Software Piracy\n\nMany people do not consider software piracy to be theft. They would never steal a rupee from someone but would not think twice before using pirated software. There is a common perception amongst normal computer users to not consider software as \"property\". This has led to software piracy becoming a flourishing business.\n\nScenario 1:\n\nThe software pirate sells the pirated software in physical media (usually CD ROMs) through a close network of dealers.\n\nModus Operandi: The suspect uses high speed CD duplication equipment to create multiple copies of the pirated software. This software is sold through a network of computer hardware and software vendors.\n\nModus Operandi: Thesuspect registers a domain name using a fictitious name and then hosts his website using a service provider that is based in a country that does not have cyber laws. Such service providers do not divulge client information to law enforcement officials of other countries.\n\nMany people do not consider music piracy to be theft. They would never steal a rupee from someone but would not think twice before buying or using pirated music. There is a common perception amongst people that music is not \"property\". There is a huge business in music piracy. Thousands of unscrupulous businessmen sell pirated music at throw away prices.\n\nScenario 1:\n\nThe music pirate sells the pirated music in physical media (usually CD ROMs) through a close network of dealers.\n\nModus Operandi: The suspect uses high speed CD duplication equipment to create multiple copies of the pirated music. This music is sold through a network of dealers.\n\nThe music pirate sells the pirated music through electronic downloads through websites, bulletin boards, newsgroups, spam emails etc.\n\nModus Operandi: The suspect registers a domain name using a fictitious name and then hosts his website using a service provider that is based in a country that does not have cyber laws. Such service providers do not divulge client information to law enforcement officials of other countries.\n\nEmails are fast emerging as one of the most common methods of communication in the modern world. As can be expected, criminals are also using emails extensively for their illicit activities.\n\nIn the first step, the suspect convinces the victim that the victim is going to get a lot of money (by way of winning a lottery or from a corrupt African bureaucrat who wants to transfer his ill gotten gains out of his home country). In order to convince the victim, the suspect sends emails (some having official looking documents as attachments).\n\nOnce the victim believes this story, the suspect asks for a small fee to cover legal expenses or courier charges. If the victim pays up the money, the suspect stops all contact.\n\nUsual motive: Illegal financial gain.\n\nApplicable law\n\nBefore 27 October, 2009\n\nAfter 27 October, 2009\n\nSection 420 of Indian Penal Code\n\nSections 66A and 66D of the Information Technology Act and section 420 of Indian Penal Code"}

Apple is under increasing pressure to take preventative security measures by cyber experts in the wake of 600,000 malware-infected Macs.\n\n\"Myths die hard,\" writes security guru Dr. Stan Stahl. \"Users can no longer naively claim that they don't need to be concerned with security because they use a Macintosh.\"\n\nHe believes cybercriminals see no difference between Mac OS X and Windows.\n\n\"It's cold comfort that this particular vulnerability surfaced in Java-so well known as a source of attack exploits that we recommend users disable it,\" he writes. \"The lesson we need to take away from the Mac OS X story is humility in the face of software complexity.\"\n\nAs one of the nation's leading authorities, Dr. Stahl is a principal at Citadel Information Group,  in Los Angeles.\n\n\"In the 1980s I was a staff security engineer at TRW when my manager gave me a piece of wisdom that applies to the myth of Mac security,\" he writes:\n\nThere are three kinds of knowledge,\" he said. \"There's what you know that you know you know. There's what you don't know that you know you don't know. And there's what you don't know that you don't know that you don't know.\"\n\nDr. Stahl warns about the dangers of the third category of what we don't know.\n\n\"It's this third category that is most dangerous-what we don't know that we don't know we don't know,\" he writes. \"This-our hidden ignorance-is what gets us into trouble. Believing the myth of Mac security-jumping to the conclusion that Macs are secure because we don't know about their insecurities-is dangerous because the myth keeps us from taking the actions necessary to protect sensitive information on our Macs.\"\n\nHe has more thoughts about myths.\n\n\"There is the myth that IT can effectively manage cyber security; that senior management doesn't need to get involved,\" believes Dr. Stahl. \"There is the myth that antivirus and anti-malware solutions provide sufficient security.\n\n\"There is the myth that 'we have nothing of interest to a cyber criminal.' And the most dangerous myth of all-that we can be secure if we simply do A, B and C, whatever A, B and C happen to be,\" he warns. \"It is these and other myths that keep us from being open to what we don't know that we don't know we don't know.\"\n\nHis parting shot:\n\n\"When it comes to cyber security management, myths are particularly dangerous,\" he writes. \"Our greatest security weakness-our greatest vulnerability-lies in the security myths we believe.

Hundreds of people were victimized.\n\nThese stories are another lesson to take cybercrime seriously.\n\nFor best practices in thwarting cybercriminals, I always turn to nationally recognized security expert, Dr. Stan Stahl, of Citadel Information Group in Los Angeles.\n\nHis tips:\n\nKeep systems patched with the latest updates. (His security blog, Weekend Vulnerability and Patch Report, lists major updates for software typically found in small offices and home computers.)\n\nRun up-to-date anti-virus anti-malware software \u2013 or what is even better, a strong intrusion detection and prevention solution.\n\nUse strong passwords for access to sites with sensitive information. Password length is more important than randomness; size matters. '2HelloPepper#' is a much stronger password than \"Ab$%16vF\" plus it's a lot easier to remember.\n\n\"Be extremely sensitive to social engineering attacks,\" Dr. Stahl adds. \"Don't open email attachments or click on links in emails unless the email is from someone you know and is expected.\"\n\n\"Passwords are like underwear: you don't let people see it, you should change it very often, and you shouldn't share it with strangers.\"\n\n-Chris PirilloUnfortunately, we've learned another lesson about passwords at the expense of 16,288 patients who've been treated at UCLA's network of hospitals and clinics.

What's more, you deserve to be hacked.\"\n\n-White House Cybersecurity Advisor, Richard Clarke whopping 79 percent of companies in the U.S. and U.K. experienced Web-borne attacks in 2012, according to data released in 2013. These incidents continue to represent a significant threat to corporate brands.\n\nResults from a Web security study show that almost all of the Web security administrators agreed that Web browsing is a serious malware risk to their companies. Despite the obvious awareness of the risks, only 56 percent of participants said they had implemented Web security protection and more than half of companies without Web security had Web sites compromised.\n\nAnother study discloses a disturbing trend \u2013 nearly four out of five small companies are storing unsecured data about their customers. That's an indictment of such businesses, and is alarming news for consumers about their vulnerability to credit card fraud and identity theft.\n\nThe 2011 study was conducted by the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA).\n\n\"Citadel works with small business leaders every day and \u2013 based on our experience \u2013 the reason small businesses don't take cybercrime seriously is that they see it primarily as something their IT people are managing, not yet realizing the critical importance of their own leadership,\" says Dr. Stahl.\n\n\"This includes establishing clear policies and standards for information use, explicitly assigning cyber security management responsibility to a member of the senior management team, providing cyber security awareness training and education to all information users, and ensuring that IT personnel are effectively managing the security of the IT infrastructure,\" he adds.\n\n\"Seventy-nine percent of businesses are storing consumer information when they don't need it.

They've even been caught posting comments about patients on Facebook.\n\nAlmost 40 percent of hospitals and physicians report they have caught patients using another person's identity when they seek treatment.\n\nIn public reports, theft was responsible for 66 percent of medical ID breaches in the last two years. The thefts include notebook computers, smartphones, using another person's personal information for fraudulent claims, and people using others' names.\n\nMore shocking news\n\nAuthors of the PwC study indicated most healthcare organizations aren't equipped to prevent medical ID theft \u2013 despite the growing use of information technology in the medical profession.\n\n\"Most breaches are not the result of [information technology] IT hackers, but rather reflect the increase in the risks of the knowledgeable insider related to identity theft and simple human error \u2013 loss of a computer or device, lack of knowledge or unintended unauthorized disclosure,\" said James Koenig, director of the Health Information Privacy and Security Practice at PwC in a press statement.\n\nMore than 50 percent of the study's respondents who work for healthcare organizations said they knew of at least one privacy breach since 2009.\n\n\"Doctors need to take measures to assure their patients are who they say they are,\" recommends Dr. Stahl. \"That can include checking referrals.\"\n\nWhat can patients do?\n\n\"Patients need to treat their medical information with the same care that they treat their financial information, including periodically checking with their insurance company to identify fraudulent activity,\" advises Dr. Stahl.\n\nThe PwC study indicated that most healthcare organizations admit they haven't even begun to adequately deal with privacy and security issues in this digital-information age.\n\nObviously, as a business-performance consultant, here's my sense:\n\nThe medical profession should immediately take adequate security precautions.\n\n\"If you reveal your secrets to the wind, you should not blame the wind for revealing them to the trees.\"\n\n-Kahlil GibranCitibank's acknowledgment that private information of 360,083 North American Citigroup credit card accounts was stolen by hackers, which affected 210,000 customers, serves as a warning for all businesses and consumers to take precautionary steps.\n\nNone of the reports I found pointed out that it was Citibank's second reported major security issue in just 18 months.

The site creates a favorable first impression.\n\nBut in my recent visit to the site, an important element was also missing \u2013 an unfortunate omen, if you will. You see, appearances in business are important, especially first-impressions about IT security. However, Epsilon has failed to adequately reassure its site's visitors that it provides cutting-edge security. In today's IT environment, that's more than just a gaffe. It suggests a catastrophe of monumental proportions waiting to happen.\n\nUnfortunately, such a security breakdown has already occurred. Indeed, on April 1, 2011, an ominous press release appeared on the company's Web site. Unfortunately, it was not an April Fool's joke.\n\nEpsilon published this terse announcement:\n\nEpsilon Notifies Clients of Unauthorized Entry into Email System\n\nIRVING, TEXAS \u2013 April 1, 2011 - On associated with those names was at risk. A full investigation is currently underway.\n\nEpsilon's notice didn't please me. You see, the cybercriminals were already at work. Several days prior to the press-release posting on March 30, I became aware that something was amiss \u2013 phishing scams trying to entice businesses and consumers to take advantage of so-called offers.\n\nAfterward, Threatpost reported that some of Epsilon's customers in-turn warned their customers \u2014 here's the warning from Disney Destinations to its customers:\n\n\"We have been informed by one of our email service providers, Epsilon, that your email address was exposed by an unauthorized entry into that provider's computer system.

The article was certainly intended to be helpful, but it didn't seem right.\n\nNot to pick on reporter Casey Newton, but I was left wanting more and better information. It seemed to be nothing more than PR fluff for TrendMicro.\n\nSo, I sent the article to a nationally known security expert, Dr. Stan Stahl in Los Angeles ( Does Dr. Stahl agree with Mr. Perry?\n\nHere are his responses to the four points:\n\nDavid Perry:\"Make sure your computer isn't infected already.\"\n\nDr. Stahl: Yes. By all means scan. Even use Trend Micro's HouseCall. But don't be lulled into a false sense of security. Remember that the most serious attacks like 0-days and drive-bys are written to get past antivirus programs. That's why we publish our \"Weekend Vulnerability and Patch Management Report.\"\n\nDavid Perry: \"Avoid exposing your credit number.\"\n\nDr. Stahl: More important than this item 2 is to (i) always make sure you're running https and not just http before entering your credit card info and (ii) if given the option, don't let smaller retailers store your credit card numbers [they're less likely to have proper security].\n\nDavid Perry: \"Use protection.\"\n\nDr. Stahl: Definitely use protection, but don't forget to keep all your programs patched and run a good spam filter. That's what makes this so misleading; it conveys the impression that running antivirus is enough. It's not! Users can subscribe to our blog and update their computer in accordance with our \"Weekend Vulnerability and Patch Management Report.\"\n\nDavid Perry:\"Watch where you click.\"\n\nDr. Stahl: Yes; never click a link in an email and always check the seller's reputation. The part about buying from the manufacturer is bogus.\n\nDr. Stahl, thank you for your usual valuable insights.\n\n(Note: I've known Dr. Stahl a long time and consider him the go-to security expert. He and I are also members of Consultants West,  a roundtable of veteran consultants that meets in Los Angeles.)\n\nFrom the Coach's Corner, here's an online safety checklist from Dr. Stahl:\n\nCybercriminals want your bank account and credit card numbers so they can take your money and use your credit while stiffing you with the bill. They want your social security number so they can apply for credit in your name, stealing your identity. They have even begun selling stolen medical insurance information.\n\nCybercriminals steal your sensitive personal information by taking control of your computer. This control also lets them install rogue programs on your computer, turning your computer into a zombie under their control\u2014the cyber-equivalent of Night of the Living Dead. These control programs make money for the cybercriminals by sending spam, displaying pop-up ads, and committing sophisticated computer crime.\n\nCybercriminals take control of your computer by exploiting four weaknesses:\n\nEvery computer program running on your computer has subtle programming errors (vulnerabilities) that cybercriminals exploit to take control of your computer.\n\nLegitimate internet web sites often fail to prevent cybercriminals from installing malicious programs on their web sites. When you visit these sites, these malicious programs silently install Trojan horses and other malware on your computer.\n\nDefault settings for many computer programs make it easy for cyber criminals to take control of your computer.\n\nUsers often don't know what they need to do to minimize the dangers and risks of cybercrime, particularly the need for defense-in-depth.\n\nLimit Exposure: Create separate accounts for all family members. This is done in the Control Panel. Set account type to \"Limited\" unless the account needs to run programs as \"Administrator.\" This will make it harder for cybercriminals to install malware on your computer.\n\nProtect Your Desktop: Install a reputable antivirus \/ antispyware product & keep it up-to-date. If you're technical, run Firefox with the NoScript add-on inside of sandboxie and install a host intrusion prevention system. Sophisticated cybercriminals can get past basic antivirus\/antispyware software. Antivirus is necessary. It is not sufficient.\n\nSecure Your WiFi: If you have a wireless network, encrypt it with WPA2 encryption. Otherwise anyone near you can eavesdrop on your communications and piggy-back on your connection.\n\nStay Away from P2P Networks: Don't run Peer-to-Peer or other file sharing programs, such as Kazaa, Limewire or BitTorrent. These networks provide strangers access to your computer.\n\nBeware of Scams, 1: Don't click on web-site ads or pop-ups offering to scan your computer for free. Cybercriminals love to take advantage of people's fear of getting a virus. Instead of scanning your computer, these programs will infect it. Always be wary.\n\nBeware of Scams, 2: Don't open unusual or unexpected attachments, not even from people you know. It's easy to send an email so it looks like it came from someone else. Also, how do you know your friend's computer hasn't been taken over? Always be wary.\n\nBeware of Scams, 3: Don't follow links in unfamiliar or unusual emails, especially those requesting your user names, passwords, or financial information. A SPAM filter can help you avoid these e-mails but you must be on guard for emails that get past your SPAM filter. Always be wary.\n\nOnly buy on-line from merchants using SSL, which means the website address begins with  Look for the \"lock\" on the title bar of Internet Explorer or Firefox's lower right corner.\n\nUse a credit card rather than a debit card when shopping on-line. Link PayPal to your credit card, not your bank account. Federal law limits your credit card exposure to $50. There is no corresponding limit if you use a debit card (even though many banks cover debit card fraud).\n\nDefense Strategy 3: Protect Your Information Away from Home\n\nKeep your laptop with you at all times. Never leave it unattended in your car.\n\nKeep WiFi and Bluetooth turned off except when you are using them.\n\nEncrypt the hard drive of your laptop, protecting it with a strong 15+ character passphrase. If you lose the laptop, the information is still safe. You can get free encryption software at \n\nNever use a public computer, Kiosk, or public WiFi for online banking, shopping or to access sensitive information. Since you don't know how secure these are, prudence requires you to assume they are insecure.\n\nDefense Strategy 4: Watch Your Credit\n\nSubscribe to a basic credit monitoring service (AAA California offers members a free service)\n\n\"Security is always excessive until it's not enough.\"\n\n-Robbie SinclairWith businesses allowing BYOD and the escalating malware abuse, cybercriminals are so successful in invading smartphones, it's leading to a security services industry totaling $1.88 billion in 2013. That's the finding in an ABI Research report.\n\nBYOD is the acronym for bring your own device. In trying save money, many businesses mistakenly allow workers to use their own cell phones in their duties at work. (See Do BYOD Headaches Outweigh Benefits? Yes.)\n\nFurthermore, a government task force has warned mobile users about a another malware threat. The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) warns the malware is especially dangerous for Androids. The malware that tricks Android users are called Loozfon and FinFisher, and IC3 issued security tips for users.\n\nThe banking-industry article explains the difference between corporate and retail mobile banking. Corporate mobile banking is used by high net worth executives. Retail mobile banking refers to use by the masses.\n\n\u200eNot to be gauche, but in 2009 you saw the warning about retail mobile banking here first.\n\nSo now, bankers are concerned about the dangers of corporate mobile banking.\n\nStern warning\n\nMobile banking is so risky an IT security guru said don't do it. That was the online security warning on Sept. 7 from the authoritative Dr. Stan Stahl of Citadel Information Group in Los Angeles.\n\nIt was a very popular column in terms of readership. But it also incurred reactionary-venom from a mobile-banking marketer and his friends. Ordinarily, reader responses are given space to comment on my columns. However, his crude sarcasm regarding Dr. Stahl's expert analysis and my alleged chutzpah in publishing the column was offensive.\n\nAfter mulling it over a day or so I decided not to give him space on this site. He had crossed the line of civility.\n\nAfter more than a year had transpired I had, of course, forgotten about the incident.\n\nYou might not want to check your bank account from your phone after all. Mobile apps from USAA, Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and TD Ameritrade have major security holes, reports research firm viaForensics and WSJ. The bugs center mainly around iPhone and Android versions of the apps, and could potentially allow a hacker to learn your username, password, and some financial information. In other words, this is bad.\n\nYes, you're reading correctly about this information technology red flag. Published reports indicate there have been mobile-banking security lapses on iPhone and Android apps at USAA, Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and TD Ameritrade.\n\nWhoa! It's time to check with Dr. Stahl, a nationally recognized expert, for his typically astute response. (Visit his Web site,  and you'll understand why I implicitly trust his opinions.)\n\n\"This\u2026 is about learning from experience, particularly that when it comes to cyber security we all need to be a lot more 'intellectually humble'when we talk about how secure something is,\" he responded. \"Right now, the cyber criminals are winning,\" he wrote. \"They are winning in part because too many people have a false sense of their own security.\"\n\nPrior experience\n\nDr. Stahl's security credentials are impressive as a consultant and so is his prior experience, which includes many years in the aerospace industry \"securing critical national security software.\"\n\n\"I can remember the day we found a critical vulnerability in Cruise missile software that might have kept us from successfully responding to a nuclear attack,\" he recalled. \"I know the managerial, political and especially intellectual challenges we went through to be in a position to catch that mistake.\"\n\nHe knows the challenges and expense that go into producing high-quality software.\n\n\"We're taught that pride goeth before the fall,\" he added. \"That is certainly true in the battle against cyber crime. That's why perhaps the most important thing I learned in trying to prevent, find and fix critical logic errors in complex software is intellectual humility.\"\n\nHmm \u2013 intellectual humility. That's a term I'd also use to describe Dr. Stahl. He's been my go-to source for authoritative information since 2004. He's a true gentleman, a philosopher and he's assertive in responding to security questions.\n\n\"Intellectual humility is the ability to suspend our own belief in something we normally believe in, like the attorney hiring another attorney to find weaknesses in his argument or the doctor seeking a second opinion to look for holes in his diagnosis,\" Dr. Stahl wrote in explaining his approach. \"Most of us develop a normal amount of intellectual humility in those areas of our greatest expertise,\" he believes. \"We understand and appreciate just how hard it is to do the things that we are accustomed to doing and we learn through experience how to pay detailed attention to the things we need to do to do our job.\n\n\"The challenge is that, human nature being what it seems to be, our intellectual humility doesn't easily carry over to domains where we lack firsthand knowledge and experience,\" he opines. \"We tend to over-simplify in those places we know little about. This isn't usually a problem: any intellectual humility I might lack regarding how dangerous lions are is mitigated by the fact that I am under no threat from a lion. Unfortunately, when it comes to cyber security, because we're all on the Internet it's as if the lion is right next door. And he's hungry.\"\n\nResponse to mobile-banking marketer\n\nAs for the sarcastic, mobile-banking marketer from 2009, Dr. Stahl commented:\n\n\"We can't expect a marketing representative in the mobile banking industry to have tested communications software controlling our nuclear missiles any more than we can expect the CEO of a bank to have written cyber security software requirements for an advanced military intelligence system,\" he pointed out. \"Nor can we expect the people who run our business IT networks to have the same sensitivity to security that we had 25 years ago when we designed a secure network for the Strategic Air Command.\n\n\"You can see where the danger is in this since these are the same people who influence (and often make) buying decisions about software that we use to manage money and sensitive information; software that has to be adequately secure to protect the money and information it touches,\" he continued. \"And, lacking the experience, these otherwise well-meaning men and women don't understand the necessity of being intellectually humble in the presence of complex software.\"\n\nDr. Stahl's bottom-line\n\n\"That's why people who have to make decisions about cyber security management must maintain their own healthy skepticism, resisting any temptation they may have to believe cyber security claims, whether from marketing people, their banks or their own internal IT staff. Ronald Reagan is famous for saying: 'Trust. But verify.' Do him one better: drop the trust.\"\n\nWell said, Dr. Stahl. Thank you.\n\n(Disclosure: Dr. Stahl and I are both members of a roundtable of veteran consultants that meet in Los Angeles; Consultants West,  has experts from many sectors.)\n\n\"Once they get their hooks into you, you're a dead pigeon.\" -Bud AbbottOn a regular basis, cybercriminals are creating hardship for businesses and consumers. A post by blogger Brian Krebs caught my eye \u2013 a Texas company is struggling to get its bank to pay for a $50,000 cyber theft.\n\n\"Attorneys for Dallas-based Hi-Line Supply Inc.recently convinced a state court to require depositions from officials at Community Bank, Inc. of Rockwall, Texas,\" wrote Mr. Krebs. \"Hi-Line requested the sworn statements to learn more about what the bank knew in the time surrounding Aug. 20, 2009, when crooks broke into the company's online bank accounts and transferred roughly $50,000 to four individuals across the country who had no prior business with Hi-Line.\"\n\nOstensibly, the comments in the deposition are locked up, but the lawyers maintain the bank is guilty of security incompetence and a lawsuit might be the next step.\n\nMr. Krebs quoted an attorney:\n\n\"In the event Community Bank refuses to resolve this matter, now that we have uncovered some of the information obtained by virtue of the court's order, Hi-Line intends to assert claims for misrepresentation, violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, fraud, and breach of warranties, among other things,\" said Michael Lyons, a partner with the Dallas law firm Deans Lyons.\n\nThe fraud apparently began on Aug. 20 last year when Hi-Line processed its $25,000 payroll, according to Gary Evans, the firm's president.\n\n\"After Hi-Line submitted that batch of payments to its bank, the unknown intruders attempted two more transfers of nearly identical amounts on Friday and the following Monday, Aug. 24,\" explained Mr. Krebs. \"Evans said he had trouble logging in to his account on Thursday and had the bank reset his password, but the fraudulent transactions hadn't showed up on his account at that time. He said he took that Friday off as he always does, and when he tried again to log in after returning to work on Monday, he again found the bank's site would not accept his password.\"\n\nThen, Mr. Evans sensed trouble.\n\n\"When I finally got the bank to reset my password and got into my account, I noticed the duplicate payroll batches and said 'Why are you all pulling my payroll out three times?'\" Mr. Krebs quoted Mr. Evans about his recollection of how he came to realize his firm had been robbed. \"At the time, as I was resetting my password, I had to scroll through the bank's online customer agreement, which basically said the bank is not responsible for any fraud. I should have known at that point that they were not going to take any responsibility for this at all.\"\n\nMr. Evans maintains the bank should have taken notice.\n\n\"Evans said the bank should have detected that something was amiss, and not just because of the unusual and repeated payroll batches,\" wrote Mr. Krebs. \"He said the crooks accessed his account from five different Internet addresses with locations that were nowhere near Texas, including from computers located more than 1,300 miles away, in Washington, D.C. and Maryland.\"\n\nThe blogger says Community Bank did not respond to his request for a comment, but its deposition claims the cybercriminals \"had infiltrated Evans' computer with a virus and used it to steal his online banking credentials, which included a user name, password, PIN and several challenge\/response questions.\"\n\nMr. Krebs indicated the thieves pulled it off with the unknowing help of what are called money mules.\n\n\"Among those lured into the scam was Josh Enlow, a 28-year-old gas station attendant in Phoenix,\" he wrote. \"Enlow said he was hired by an entity calling itself The Total Group Co., which initially contacted him in an e-mail stating it had found his resume on a job search Web site, and would he be interested in an 'accounts payable' position?\"\n\nReported, Mr. Enlow received several fund deposits and was asked to forward the money.\n\n\"He then wired the money to individuals in Eastern Europe as instructed, he said,\" Wrote Mr. Krebs.\n\n\"If the customer wants the bank to reimburse it for fraud losses, it's up to the customer to prove that the bank's security procedures are not commercially reasonable\u2026\" says IT security expert Dr. Stan Stahl. \"The result, all too often, is that the customer has little choice but to sue the bank.\"\n\nBut Dr. Stahl says there are reasons for such victims to hope:\n\n\"There's a very good chance the bank's procedure's fail the test of commercial reasonableness,\" writes Dr. Stahl. \"\n\nBut he adds the burden of proving a bank is at-fault is \"huge.\"\n\nHe says one solution is cyber theft insurance.\n\nMy counsel is due diligence by a top-notch security adviser, and to make sure you really know your bank."}
{"text":"With 2012 coming to a close, I decided to take a look back at some of the year's more significant hacks. Two of the largest heists involved thefts of millions of records of personal data. In March, Global Payments, a credit card processor, revealed a breach in which at least 1.5 million credit card numbers were exported. And the year began when hackers targetedZappos, the online shoe retailer, and relieved this e-tailer of over 24 million rows of email addresses and other data.\n\nBased on these gigantic incidents, I thought this was the year of the Big Hack and a unique turning point. For perspective, I reviewed two years' worth of Verizon's indispensable Data Breach Investigations Reports. The DBIR is based on data collected from the US Secret Service and the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit. For 2011, Verizon reported over 855 incidents and 174 million records compromised. Last year was the second highest data loss recorded since Verizon began this study in 2004.\n\nI'm not sure if 2012 hacking levels will surpass 2011, and neither of these two years will come close to the 360 million records compromised in 2008. However, there are other trends that seem to have remained relatively constant.\n\nIn recent years, the top three industry sectors breached have been hospitality (read: restaurants), retail, and financial services. No surprises here.\n\nAnother common theme in the report is that poor authorization monitoring and procedures often broaden the damage done by attackers. Verizon suggests that companies should constantly be on the lookout for new files, especially growing archive and log files, with unusual attribute settings. These often indicate an attack in progress.\n\nThe DBIR also tells us that straightforward hacking\u2014using default passwords, stolen login credentials, or backdoor attacks\u2014is still a very effective way to extract protected data.\n\nOne revealing stat is that most of the records hacked in the last few years have not involved credit card numbers. The winner in the most-hacked-data category instead goes to plain old PII\u2014name, address, and social security number.\n\nSo how do Global Payments and Zappos match up with the overall trends? Depressingly, these two incidents fit it like a glove. Financial or retail? Check. External attack? Yes. Straightforward hack? It seems so, and no malware was involved that we know about.\n\nFor both Global Payments and Zappos, the actual exploits used are still a little fuzzy. According to Gartner Research's Avivah Litan, the Global Payments attacker may have been able to get through the company's knowledge-based authentication layer by answering questions correctly. This is still just speculation. Here's what we do know: Global Payments was PCI-DSS compliant.Visa and Mastercard have since revoked their certification.\n\nZappos, which is also PCI-DSS compliant, kept their credit card numbers encrypted and separated from other personal information. Hackers were not able to access the \"PANs\"\u2014PCI lingo for the card numbers. Zappos has kept their certification.\n\nThe most eye-opening part of Verizon's DBIR can be found in their conclusions. Not to put too fine a point on this, but companies are simply not making the attackers work very hard. It's not that they are so clever; it's that IT has been a bit lax.\n\nHere's some of their all-too-familiar advice:\n\nchange default credentials\n\nreview user accounts on a regular basis\n\nrestrict and monitor privileged users\n\nOn that last point, I'll quote the actual text from the DBIR:\n\n\"Don't give users more privileges than they need (this is a biggie) and use separation of duties. Make sure they have direction (they know policies and expectations) and supervision (to make sure they adhere to them). Privileged use should be logged and generate messages to management.\"\n\nSpeaking as a Varonis blogger, I couldn't have said it better.\n\nLet's hope some of this advice takes hold, and 2013 will be a more forgettable year in hacking annals."}

Each one of those is part of how you prevent and respond to incidents.\" Gaetan Houle, executive director of IT security at Ernst & Young LLP in Montreal, says cyber-criminals used to hack into a company's system in order to destroy information on hard drives, but today they're after information so they can steal identities. \"The attacks are designed to work in stealth mode below the radar screen, undetected, and they're designed to extricate information out of your environment without being detected.\" He says phishing is still the most prevalent problem but a popular way of attacking a company's system is still through Internet portals that are not secure, something that's posing a challenge for IT profession- als with the increasing popu- larity of cloud computing.\n\n\"[Employees] get an e- mail that they think is from their\n\nbuddy, they click on the link and end up downloading malware.\" In fact, says Houle, there are highly skilled hackers who steal intellectual property from targeted industries, such as aerospace and pharmaceuticals, and then sell it to certain foreign governments who give it to their na- tional companies. China is traditionally cited as a country where many cyber-attacks originate, but Houle maintains other countries around the globe have sophisticated networks of crimi- nal hackers. While firewalls and detection systems will catch viruses that have a digital signature, Houle says hackers are now modi- fying existing viruses, by adding random code to them, giving them a different signature.\n\nSome hackers, he says, will embed mal- ware into the HTTP code so that firewalls will not catch it.

{"text":"Contents\n\nWe are doomed. No matter how we try to protect ourselves or what safeguards we use to verify that we are who we say we are, we will fail. Hannah Montana taught me this. (Or was it Miley Cyrus? I always get confused.)\n\nRecently, RMG Technologies made big news when a judge barred the company from producing and distributing software that, apparently, enables ticket brokers to buy tons of tickets for resale. The software uses \"bots\" to find and purchase ticket blocks at sites like Ticketmaster, despite the fact that the site uses varied online safeguards designed to block this kind of activity. The judges took action after parents across the U.S. started complaining that they were getting boxed out of coveted Hannah Montana tickets.\n\nFor those who do not have preteens at home, Montana is a Disney Channel creation. Miley Cyrus stars as a high-school student with a double life: She plays both regular-girl Miley Stewart and pop-star Hannah Montana. Now the 15-year-old Cyrus is touring the country as both people. Got that?\n\nThat lunacy aside, the run on tickets for Cyrus's U.S. concerts has been nothing short of remarkable. I know this firsthand because my wife tried to buy some for our kids. One morning she sat poised to begin her quest to buy four seats (the maximum for one person). Tickets went on sale at 10 a.m. By 10:08, all the shows were sold out . At the time, I attempted to console her, saying \"Who knew this schizophrenic little lady was bigger than Madonna?\" Now I know something else was at work.\n\nThe software that RMG sells\u2014the company insists it's no more than a browser (puh-lease!)\u2014allegedly lets brokers jump to the front of the online ticket buying line and masquerade as multiple buyers. (Some of it reminds me of the old automatic phone dialers that people once used to call in to radio shows.) However, the real magic\u2014and the element that has me convinced we're doomed\u2014is the fact that the app can somehow defeat CAPTCHA.\n\nCAPTCHA, which very roughly stands for Completely Automatic Public Turing test (but also can be seen as a play on the word \"capture\") is a challenge\/response system used on thousands of Web sites. Typically, you see it at the end of a membership sign-up process or e-commerce transaction. The site presents you with a barely readable (squiggly, smudged, pixilated, etc.) series of letters and\/or numbers. They may or may not form a readable word. Your job is to type what you see into the provided field. Doing so ostensibly proves you're a human.\n\nRMG's software\u2014and others like it\u2014can apparently not only defeat CAPTCHA but actually perform the process faster than most people can. (That's quite a trick, since it means fixing the text so it's readable, OCR-ing it, and then typing it into the provided field). So the safeguard that was supposed to prove we're human is now being done by a nonhuman at superhuman speeds. Ah, the irony.\n\nThe app must also automate the credit card process. This feat, which likely involved preentering hundreds of card numbers into the app before visiting the site and then having the IP switch to make it look like many different computers are accessing the site, is fairly trivial.\u2014next: Steps Behind"}

{"text":"Federal cybersecurity workers might not be far from being able to access top-notch training directly from their computer desktops.\n\nRobert Hollingsworth, director of the security engineering and computer security training division at the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security Training Center, told Wired Workplace on Thursday that State and the Homeland Security Department have begun training federal cyber pros using virtual worlds, where each user has an avatar and is walked through different cyber scenarios.\n\nThe virtual worlds courses are part of the Federal Cybersecurity Training Event, or FedCTE, a joint program between State and DHS. The program started in 2008, after the Obama administration's Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative identified a need for addressing cybersecurity training and education within the federal workforce. FedCTE courses also were developed using the specific cybersecurity roles identified by the National Initiative on Cybersecurity Education, Hollingsworth said.\n\nThus far, the virtual worlds program has trained more than 243 students from 68 agencies on cybersecurity topics like cyber protection, response and mitigation, Hollingsworth said. \"The demand is going through the roof,\" he said. \"It's a way for these remote programs to address these cybersecurity areas and be continually modified as vulnerabilities are discovered and new security practices are identified. Even previously trained people can address new concerns in a timely fashion.\"\n\nStill, Hollingsworth noted that one challenge for government is simply defining the roles, requirements and job tasks needed for federal cybersecurity work. But a goal of the virtual training is to help overcome that hurdle, he added. \"We're finding there are a lot of roles and responsibilities that may be unique to a department, and we can go in and customize those portions and touch those individual job descriptions and tweak it,\" he said. \"That would be too hard to do in a real classroom every time, but it's not too hard to adjust these virtual modules.\"\n\nGoing forward, Hollingsworth said the program will continue to expand to include more cybersecurity workers, particularly as it gets more popular through word of mouth. \"It's in the ground floor now, but we feel it's going to be mainstreamed and that this form of training will become more of a normal activity for federal security workers,\" he said. \"It will be on their desktops at some point and they can train as needed. It's another tool in their toolbox.\""}

{"text":"I just thought I'd clear up all these rumors, questions etc regarding\nthe denial of service attacks which happened a while ago.\n\n1) Did mafiaboy use trinoo or smurf?\nHe didnt use either. He used a program called mstream and yes its\nprivate. It basically is similar to trinoo. It comprises of a client\nand a server. With the server it listens on port 7983 and you specify\nthe hosts which will connect to the server on that port. For that\nreason you must have been added to the server to packet from it. On\nthe server.c program is appears like this:\nchar *m[]={\n\"1.1.1.1\", \/* first master *\/\n\"2.2.2.2\", \/* second master *\/\n\"3.3.3.3\", \/* third master etc *\/\n0 };\n\nNow as for the client you can define a password, serverfile and max\nnumber of users to use the client at one time. The client then\nconnects to the servers and gets the servers to send all crap data to\nthe host you specify and hence if you got enough servers will take\nthem down eg as mafiaboy did.\n\n2) So did mafiaboy actully hack anything?\nThe answer is yes. All the machine he installed the server on he had\nto have root. Therefore he must have hacked a lot of machines in\npreparation for the attack on the sites.\n\n3) Did mafiaboy take out all the sites?\nNo, mafiaboy only took out yahoo, etrade and some others which I cant\nremember. Coolio took out the rest. No matter what you're told I\nassure you Coolio took out the rest.\n\n4) How come it took so long for mafiaboy to get arrested?\nSimple he hanged low and the fbi etc had not enough evidence to make\nan arrest that was until his outburst on self-evident's msg board. His\nallowed the fbi etc to swoop swiftly and quickly.\n\nNow its time for my opinion:\n1) Do you think mafiaboy will get convicted?\nWell it depends, if mafiaboy admits to dos'ing those sites then yes I\nbelieve he will be convicted then again if he denies it I believe they\nwon't have enough evidence on him. The only reason they caught him is\nthat his nick etc was posted on  He also said to a\nperson I know that he destroyed the hard drive in a fire which would\ngive the fbi no physical evidence at his end.\n\nMafiaboy's story:\nHere is a quick rephraze of what mafiaboy has said in channels before\nhe got arrested. His nick has been edited out for various reasons.\n<> god fucking damnit\n<> i wish i can go back in time\n<> and undo what i did\n\nIn closing I'll tell you how I know this. Firstly I have spoken to\npeople associated with mafiaboy. I also have the program which he used\nto take out the sites and no I won't send you it.

{"text":"About Threat Connect\n\nThrough technology, threats are advancing\n\nFor years, sophisticated cyber threats have used dynamic infrastructure, and rotate through exploits and backdoors, to frustrate detection and response efforts. As cheap and relatively anonymous cloud based resources have become available, it has only increased the speed and ease a cyber-adversary can alter their attack fingerprints. Exploits and new capabilities are also rapidly shared amongst hacker groups, the cleverness of one is leveraged by all. This creates a seemingly impossible situation for the good guys.\n\nWhat is at risk?\n\nSuccess in defending against sophisticated threats usually comes after experiencing multiple, very damaging intrusions. Revenue loss, loss of market value, damage to reputation and loss of intellectual property are all possible results of sophisticated cyber attack. This is due to each entity and organization being left to learn lessons on its own. Not only is the response expensive, but you may have already lost your company's most important assets, making any new investments useless.\n\nIs there a solution?\n\nGiven the enormous risk, and technical threat advancement, Cyber Squared knew that a new type of response was needed. The only response that made sense was to counter sophisticated threats, and their targeted attacks, by uniting the efforts of security analysts and researchers across the industry. Together we could limit the threat's ability to operate, and predict where they would go next. Through 'crowdsourcing', our collective threat intelligence increases over time and increases our ability to effectively cage our common cyber enemies. It was this thinking that led us to create ThreatConnect; a public (ThreatConnect.com), hybrid (Cloud Hosted), and private cloud product available from Cyber Squared.\n\nWhat is ThreatConnect?\n\nThreatConnect.com allows the cyber security community to input and share threat indicators, crowdsource cyber analysis problems, collaborate across security events, provide common reporting, and most importantly - protect their organizations against sophisticated cyber threats. ThreatConnect's powerful, automated threat analysis engine allows organizations to manage cyber threats throughout their lifecycle and pay attention to what matters, so they can take focused defensive actions. ThreatConnect.com builds awareness of cyber threats more effectively than any tool on the market.\n\nWhy use it?\n\nWithout a shared understanding of the threat, we will not be fully prepared for its advances. If we come together as a community and combine our strengths we can collectively stop the sophisticated cyber threat.\n\n\"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing\""}

Many of us think that like in movies where one type many programs and instantly break into a system. If we think like that, it will be of a foolish sort of business.\n\nA lot of people say that hacking is only done in cyberspace, but electronics are generally a hub of a hacking. Many people think that hacking is all bad, but it is not the case.Hackers are nerds.\n\nIt is a saying that \"A best programer is a Good hacker\",So for being a good hacker you need to know almost knowledge about programing.\n\nHackers are of three types..\n\nBlack hat hackers:-\n\nBlackhat hackers are bad ones, who hack for commercial gain, destroy other's computer and break security system for some sort of fun.Usually these hackers are highlighted in news channels ,especially in a western movie in which such a character would stereotypically wear a black hat in contrast to the hero's white hat, especially in black and white movies.\n\nWhite hat hackers\n\nThey are good ones. They spend their time in securing the network and making it safe for everyone. They usually have years of experience in network security who is specialized in penetration testing and in other testing methodologies to ensure the security of an organization's information systems.\n\nGrey hat hackers\n\nGrey hat hackers are those people who fall in between white hats and black hats.They usually don't go out of their way to be bad, but may do illegal things every now and then. They usually do not hack for personal gain or have malicious intentions, but may be prepared to technically commit crimes during the course of their technological exploits in order to achieve better security.\n\nNow you have understood that what does hacking actually tells and differnet types of hackers around us and let me tell you why hacking is done\u2026\n\n*Hacking for glory.\n\nEvery person in this world wants his name to be famous in any of the fields.\n\n*Hacking for money.\n\nMoney makes a person greedy. it makes anyone todo\n\n*hacking for revenge.\n\nRevenge is always rocking the chat in case of hacking.\n\n*Hacking for Security.\n\nLearn hacking to get more and more secured from getting secured.\n\n*Hacking for Fun.\n\nHacking is always very funny and interesting.Learn it for fun.\n\nUntil then wait for my next post which is about Gmail,Facebook,mobile and other social network hacking\u2026.\n\nAbout The Author\n\nI am a Engineering graduate(pursuing) and a INTERNET GEEK who reads every stupid articles about Hacking ..."}

{"text":"Japanese media this week broke the news that the Japanese Defense Ministry is in the midst of a $2.3 million effort with partner Fujitsu Ltd. to design a so-called \"good virus.\"\n\nThe virus will be able to identify, track and disable sources of cyberattacks, according to Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese national daily newspaper that broke the story.\n\nTested in a closed network environment, the so-called beneficial virus has the capability to trace cyberattacks back to its sources. The unnamed cyberweapon also goes beyond the immediate source of the attack and identifies \"springboard\" systems that were used to transmit the virus.\n\nOnce identified and tracked, the good virus disables the bad virus and at the same time collects \"relevant data\" for later computer forensics, according to Yomiuri Shimbun.\n\nSources within the ministry familiar with the project claim the virus has a \"high degree\" of accuracy in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks as well as those attacks intended to siphon off data from targeted computers.\n\nThe news of yet more cyberweaponry is not all good. Ever since the Stuxnet virus struck Iran's nuclear enrichment program back in 2010, talk of cyberwarfare is growing increasingly loud. Recently, sources within the British Defense Ministry spoke of developing offensive cyberweapons as a \"strike first\" capability against a potential attack. In addition, many security experts in the United States say any virus -- even those labeled as beneficial -- is dangerous and can have unexpected consequences.\n\n\"An out-of-control good virus could spread randomly or unexpectedly from machine to machine, meaning it may be hard to contain,\" said cybersleuth Graham Cluley, who noted any program that uses viral code can also be designed with non-replicating software.\n\nAt present, most of today's antivirus software would attempt to bring down any virus even one that some call beneficial.\n\nIs an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth the right approach? Japan's Defense Department thinks so. But for the rest of us it is something to consider, especially when we know where good intentions often lead.\n\nThe country that brought us such user-friendly products as Toyota, anime and Nintendo Wii is now promising or menacing us, depending how you view it, with a good computer virus to fight bad viruses.

{"text":"share this story\n\nThe Japanese Defense Ministry is developing a computer virus aimed at seeking and destroying cyber attacks launched against the country, according to local media reports.\n\nThe malware-fighting cyberweapon, which is being created by defense contractor Fujitsu for an estimated $2.3 million, has the ability to identify the source of a cyber attack with a high level of accuracy, then replicate itself from computer to computer, cleaning up viruses across the network, according to the Japanese new site The Yomiuri Shimbun.\n\nThe cyberweapon, which has been in development since 2008, has been tested in a closed network environment and was developed for defense, but Japanese lawmakers must create new legislation allowing for its use because it would appear to violate current Japanese law, the site reported.\n\nNews of the effort comes amid growing concern over cyber attacks in Japan. Last year, Japan's parliament, Japanese defense contractor Mitsubishi Heavy and several of Japan's overseas diplomatic missions were targeted by hackers, according to local media.\n\nJapan's development of a cyberweapon is part of what some experts see as a growing cyber arms race. The Stuxnet computer virus, which damaged Iran's nuclear program in 2010, was one of at least five cyber weapons developed on a single platform, according to Russian computer security firm Kaspersky Lab. Security experts believe the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, though the two nations have not accepted responsibility.\n\n\"Good\" viruses have been tried in the past. The problem is always unforseen issues. How do you defend releasing something, and saying \"oh I'm sorry it screwed up your computer, but you see, it was a 'good' virus...\" Such a thing always falls to being unethical. If the user doesn't want it on their computer, the virus has no right (legal or ethically) to spread itself.\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\n\"The virus also has the ability to disable the attacking program and collect relevant information. \"\n\nDepending on the type of cyber attack, this could be possible. If its a phishing attack for example, the information being stolen needs to be sent to a computer under the hackers control. If you can attach some means to piggy back on this info and then send details back of the hackers computer back to the \"good guys\", then you have your working system.\n\nAdditionally, even if a botnet is being used, if you can trace back to the infected zombie computer then installing another program on to the zombie is probably less difficult then you would think (the zombie computer probably isnt very well defended in the first place if its already in a botnet). Once on the zombie, it could be possible to trace back to the command and control computers of the botnet.\n\nSo frankly whilst being very difficult tfrom a technological point of view, and difficult from a legal point of view, the truth is that anytime you want information from someone, you need a return path and that leaves open a door for someone else to trace you. \n\nIf it disables any installed malware, and determines the point of entry plus traces back to an IP, even if it is from some proxy, it can go a long way. And a good start to building on auto defences. Difficult to trace back to the actual attacker though, I agree.\n\niamwired: If it disables any installed malware, and determines the point"}

{"text":"April Fool's Day is a traditional holiday for the Internet\u2013perhaps the one holiday that is celebrated more on the internet than anywhere else. The ease with which 'regular' websites can be changed out for prank versions, as well as the various subtle ways in which clever hacks can take place, combine to make a holiday that can be enjoyed by both the prankers and the prankees.\n\nAmongst many websites that offer April Fools Day fare, there are certain standouts that reliably serve clever and interesting pranks year after year. Google is well known for offering several absurd new products and services as pranks, mixed with one new service that is genuine\u2013for instance, GMail was originally offered as a prank.\n\nThinkgeek offers a front page full of somewhat dubious and zany offerings, though, like Google, they usually end up implementing at least one of them\u2013Canned Unicorn Meat and the iPad Arcade Cabinet, for instance.\n\nSlashdot has traditionally had any number of prank stories on their frontpage, along with dubious 'features' and assorted other amusements; just as traditional is the grumbling of the killjoys who decry, every year, the 'stupid' practice of engaging in various shenanigans once a year.\n\nWorth noting as an ancillary to the Internet's celebration is MIT's tradition of elaborate physical hacks\u2013modifying a rotunda to look like R2D2, for instance. This year's appears to be a visit from a certain Doctor.\n\nThe military also will occasionally allow a prank or two to be seen in the public domain; this year's announcement of new headgear for the Army appears to be just such an occasionESR's seminal work on the jargon and culture of the common hacker, The Jargon File, defines a significant chunk of hacker folklore. Quantum Bogodynamics (a play off of the existing field of quantum chromodynamics, which describes quark interactions) is a folk theory deriving from the inconsistent behavior of hardware and software in the presence of those not sufficiently inculcated into the mysteries of How Things Work. Usually these would be suits\u2013that is, upper management of dubious technical ability\u2013but often enough those who work on the front lines of the IT world will notice a significant bogon flux around certain users.\n\nThe bogon is a notional particle that is a charge carrier for entropy, essentially. Where there are significant bogon levels, machines break down in various ways\u2013they refuse to boot properly; software may throw various errors; printers will jam. There are enough anecdotal cases of a simple desk move solving problems with nearby hardware\u2013moving the user away from the machine's proximity stopped the machine from throwing fits\u2013that variations on this hypothesis are widely believed by significant numbers of technical personnel.\n\nThis may be part of the notional reason behind the aura of competence effect; technical personnel are heavy emitters of antibogons (c.f. 'cluons' in the original jargon) and as such can purge a recalcitrant system in short order by being nearby. This also explains why certain formerly technically competent personnel, when promoted to nontechnical managerial positions, lose the ability to perform these feats; being in meetings with various suits surpresses their antibogon production. By analogy with a breeder reactor, these meetings may cause a formerly clueful person to begin to emit bogons much like the other suits involved.\n\nBogon production may be related to emotional intensity, as well; the more upset or angered the bogon producer is at the situation, the more likely it is that some critical component will start to fail. This explains the prevalence of errors in product demonstrations.\n\nAs of yet, there has been no literature regarding bogon shielding, but a 6\u2032 air gap between the bogon producer and any component of the machine under diagnosis or treatment usually appears to do the trick. The effectiveness of sheet lead has not yet been evaluated.\n\nVarious occupations have bits and pieces of folklore associated with their work\u2013gremlins, from last week's FFF, were originally a tale told by pilots and aircraft mechanics before they were fuzzy creatures with a problem with midnight snacks. The computer world is no exception; various technical occupations have their own bits and pieces of folklore that are handed down over time and which fill the same kind of explicative niche for these people as the gremlins did for mechanics.\n\nThe Aura of Competence is an experience common to most support technicians who have worked in the field for any length of time. The support tech will show up to fix a problem that the customer has reported, and the simple act of showing up is \"enough\" to make things run smoothly again.\n\nNumerous \"explanations\" for this effect exist\u2013some of which involve notional particles called \"bogons\" which are charge-carriers for \"bogosity,\" the principle that makes things break down. The highly selective nature of this kind of entropy nearly always strikes certain select users, and always at times when they were \"not doing anything, [they] swear!\"\n\nPresumably, the technician acts much like the moderating medium in a nuclear reactor, then, and inhibits the bogon flux, thus allowing the machine to operate smoothly again.\n\nAnother variation is when a process (registering someone on a website, say, or printing a document) continually fails, and no amount of coaxing by the user will make the process successfully complete. Again, the technician shows up and either performs the \"exact same\" actions, or watches the user do so\u2013and the process succeeds. The user will generally protest that it had only \"just\" started working when the technician showed up.\n\nThis variant is rather like the koan of the LISP machine, in that the process will only work when someone of sufficient understanding is present.\n\nThis effect may be found in other sufficiently technical disciplines, whenever there is equipment whose functioning is beyond the ability of a layman to fully understand. Rationally, the users in all the above cases must not have observed some difference in the machine's setup or the procedure; however, users are not usually very rational and will seek to rationalize that the technician's presence must have had some kind of magic effect. Accordingly, it may be in the technician's professional best interests to play along; users tend to become more than a little resentful if they're informed that the problem is all in their head, and some of these users may write the technician's paycheck.\n\nGremlins first came to the notice of the public from stories of military\n\nWhile most of the modern understanding of Lycanthropy is more a product of Hollywood than of folklore per se, the stories of people who could turn into animals are fairly old in basis. The word itself derives from the Greek, and hearkens back to the days when the mythic cycles told of the Gods descending to the Earth and taking the form of animals for various purposes. Neither were these stories limited to the Greco-Roman mythic cycles; the Norse had their own versions, as did the Chinese, as did every other civilization\u2013the Tempter taking the form of a snake, according to traditional interpretations of the Genesis story, could be seen as another example of these.\n\nGenerally, the animal transformations could be grouped into voluntary and involuntary types; the involuntary ones\u2013the hollywood Werewolf, the transformation of Actaeon into a deer\u2013being the result of some sort of curse or divine disfavor and the voluntary ones typically the result of some form of magic.\n\nThe Hollywood version of the Werewolf, as a myth of modern society, presents some interesting implications. Various films have described the interactions with society that a typical werewolf would have to handle; in many cases, they are depicted as lonely figures that are required to keep apart from society and associate more with their animal brethren than with humans.\n\nIntegrating them into society would not necessarily be too difficult, though. While there would certainly need to be some regulation\u2013rabies vaccinations and licensing, for a start\u2013many of the 'savage' aspects of the lycanthropic transformation could be handled by a good trainer. The lycanthrope is generally depicted along the same lines as particularly vicious dogs are\u2013slavering, biting, etc.\u2013so the techniques used to establish proper canine behavior could well be put to good use, albeit with some slightly greater hazard to the trainer than the norm. Given that the lycanthrope may retain some human understanding, though, the training could well proceed faster than it otherwise would; they'll be more likely to understand the instructions being given than a regular dog would.\n\nAdd to this some therapy for the human side of the equation, in order to counteract the feelings of isolation that would otherwise result, and the situation begins to look even better. With proper canine conditioning and human understanding, the heretofore savage and uncontrollable lycanthrope could well become a valuable member of society.\n\nThere would be significant career opportunities available for a werewolf as well. Wildlife management of all types could benefit from someone able to see from the animal perspective and communicate from the human perspective. Wolf pack management in national parks would benefit\u2013who better to manage the pack than someone who is, at least sometimes, a wolf themselves? Urban areas could benefit, as well\u2013the city of Chicago has a number of coyotes that live inside city limits and act to keep the vermin population down; tracking them could be more easily accomplished by a lycanthrope.\n\nThen, the immunity to normal weaponry would also help; SWAT would very much benefit from lycanthropic members\u2013until criminals began to produce silver bullets, at any rate.\n\nThere's really no need for lycanthropes to hide from modern society any more than any other group, nor any call for modern society to discriminate agaisnt their condition. Their inconveniences can be overcome, and their unique talents used for the betterment and benefit of society and society's interactions with the natural worldAmongst the traditional beliefs of many European peoples is the concept of a domestic helper spirit\u2013one version is known as the Brownie. A Brownie, in exchange for a bit of bread and milk, will watch out for and help the family with which they are associated\u2013this includes cleaning and other similar tasks.\n\nUnfortunately, the use of faery labor in one's household could bring one into conflict with any number of labor laws. First, bread and milk would not count for sufficient wage; federal minimum wage rules place very strict limits on what proportion of a worker's pay can be designated by the employer for the purpose of providing meals and housing. Additionally, traditionally the Brownie has been said to, for instance, warn the family of fire and other hazards by waking them; this watchman function may qualify as overtime work, and demand further compensation.\n\nFurther, Brownies are very short, and may qualify for ADA modifications being required to accomodate them. And then there's the conflict potential for human workers\u2013exploiting faery labor for kitchen and domestic help would necessarily displace any number of maids and other domestics who currently make a living by cleaning houses and the like; if brownie labor became popular and reliable, then these workers would likely be forced to organize and to lobby for greater oversight in the market.\n\nAdditionally, there's the actions of the brownies themselves when they are displeased with their arrangements\u2013they are said to perform 'mischevious' acts (read: criminal mischeif) by breaking plates (vandalism) and driving unwanted people from the house (assault, etc.)\u2013activities which are outside the scope of typically acceptable employer\/employee relationships.\n\nBrownies, were they in today's society, would have great difficulties adjusting\u2013and the people who employ them, typically moreso.\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor breaks a story that's not been news for years\u2013that astrology has little to do with astronomy and a lot more to do with tradition.\n\nThe gist of the article is that, over time, a process called precession\u2013the same process that's responsible for the gradual drift of the pole away from the 'traditional' North Star and toward other regions of the sky\u2013has realigned the zodiac to a path other than the 'original' one. Even further, the 'original' one had little legitimacy, itself being a bit of fudging by the Babylonians who wanted a nice round, symbolic number for their zodiac, and which was passed down accordingly. The author publishes a table of dates and signs, including the 'neglected' 13th sign (Ophiuchus, aka 'The Chariot Driver) though no attempt at revision of traits for persons born during those dates is attempted.\n\nThe western tradition is not the only one that's attempted to chart people's personality and fortune by way of the alignment of the stars; there are traditions in China and India of similar sorts, and of somewhat greater complexity depending upon the specific tradition consulted.\n\nIt's interesting to note that most civilizations have had, at some point, a desire to correlate a person's life circumstances with the positions of the stars and planets at the time of their birth; this appearance of a correlation between birthdate (by whatever measure) and personality is still widely believed despite there being no correlation found in many studies. This seems to be a very early and long-standing form of confirmation bias; no doubt the 'traditional' aspect\u2013astrology in various forms has been verifiably practiced as far into antiquity as Babylon\u2013helps to convince people of its usefulness (for why else would people keep believing it if it didn't work?\u2013this being a funny sort of circular logic).\n\nThat's not to say that astrology has no use; in antiquity, knowing what 'sign' it was was really the only way of reliably keeping track of the calendar and of the planting seasons and the like; to those ancients who first figured out that the stars held repeatable timepieces that related in some way to earthly events, this must have seemed a miraculous and god-given thing\u2013so naturally ascribing other earthly events to the stars would only have made sense.\n\nUnto whose use the pregnant suns are poised,\nWith idiot moons and stars retracting stars?\nCreep thou between \u2014 thy coming's all unnoised.\nHeaven hath her high, as Earth her baser, wars.\nHeir to these tumults, this affright, that fray\n(By Adam's, fathers', own, sin bound alway);\nPeer up, draw out thy horoscope and say\nWhich planet mends thy threadbare fate, or mars. \u2014 Sir John Christie, by way of Rudyard Kipling"}

{"text":"Who the PlayStation Network Hack Really Affects\n\nThe external intrusion, as Sony is wont to refer to it, into the PlayStation Network is kind of a big deal. Straight from their Q&A about the situation, Sony confirms that there are 77 million accounts that could possibly have completely compromised data. All data from the profile, such as name, email, birthday and address, plus maybe more, is in the hands of those who hacked the network.\n\nSmooth move, Sony.\n\nThat said, they have finally announced that they have no evidence that credit card information had been gleaned. Unlike their personal data tables, they'd deigned to encrypt all of that. That hasn't stopped people from coming out of the woodwork to blame Sony's data leak for their own financial issues however. As other outlets have pointed out, that's possibly due to being on high alert for such things.\n\nHaving established that this \"intrusion\" is a big deal, the question then becomes is it really a Big Deal like many are making it out to be? If Sony's correct in stating that credit card data was safe from those pesky hackers, then it's more likely that a PSN user will drown in their bathtub than have financial repercussions stemming from this breach. In fact, considering that the chances of that data being out in the open is close to nil, it's more likely that a PSN user will do\u2026 anything rather than having financial repercussions.\n\nIn reality, the Big Deal that everyone seems to be concerning themselves with is almost a non-event for the average user. For a vast majority of people, all of that personal data that might now be out there in the aether could be found with a quick Google search. It's surprising the number of people who volunteer information to be shared publically. With just a name and a general location, a plethora of information can be dug up on just about anyone. If nothing else, the RealID incident with Blizzard taught us that.\n\nSo, having eliminated any real threat to the common folk, the repercussions fall almost entirely on Sony. Due to their mishandling of the situation, they have opened themselves up to various forms of litigation. A class-action lawsuit already brews on the horizon. Add to that that there's some speculation that storing personal data without encryption might land them in hot water in other ways as well.\n\nBut the week delay in notification and the very, very small chance that any issues arise from the theft have more or less put Sony's approval rating in the toilet. Yes, the service is free to the public, but that doesn't excuse the response time. It doesn't help that it happened the week that Portal 2, Mortal Kombat and SOCOM 4 hit shelves. All three require PSN connectivity for many of their functions. Given that it's been down this long, there's no doubt that it's hurt what might have otherwise been a phenomenal week for the PlayStation 3.\n\nAnd now that any trust they had previously garnered is gone, Sony will have to build it back up again in ways that this writer can't imagine. That, or they'll simply chalk it up as a loss and move on. Either way, this whole saga has been one huge tech no-no after another. Sony failed to encrypt, failed to inform and just overall failed to keep up their end of the bargain. Their response\u2014when it finally came\u2014seems appropriate and thoroughly researched. But it came too late.\n\nThere are many folks out there arguing that Sony isn't responsible for the attacks on their network; the real perpetrators are the criminals involved here. That isn't entirely untrue. Sony the company is hurt most of all by this action, with the consumers being factored in as a tangential factor. It's not about what those hackers will do with the information.\n\nWell if it's a hacker he hacked into their system, all while Sony was defending attack's from a hacking group. So how is it their fault please tell me?. So your'e basically saying if i hack the government it's the government's fault because they didn't stop me before i could hack into their system's, it's hacker's job to hack system's not Sony's fault not at all."}
{"text":"a Cyber War Would Be a Better Option\n\nInstead of sending military troops overseas to countries to fight a bloody war, they can sit in front of computers in \"dimly-lit rooms\" that are air conditioned to search and destroy virtually. Cyber wars have the ability to deal with some of the world's detrimental problems, such as crime, terrorism and nuclear threats. By way of technology the government can use computer viruses to tap into enemy networks in order to detect and attack. The enemy can only speculate where the cyber attack came from because the hackers are able to do the job anonymously. The fact that a cyber war doesn't involve weapons of bloody destruction, only those weapons of bits and bytes that live in the virtual world means lives can be saved and soldiers wouldn't need to be deployed. In addition, governments can save a lot of money on war fare because the cost to create and deploy cyber weaponry is a fraction of the cost for other interventions. \"The early returns seem to suggest the great efficacy of this new mode of conflict.\"\n\nWhat's the Big Idea?\n\nNo one likes war, but right now with tensions rising in Iran, Israel and the United States, it definitely looks as if a war is on the horizon. If a war comes to fruition, then the cyber route would be the best for everyone. \"Once the first network or nation takes this path, as some observers believe the United States is doing, others will surely follow, starting a new arms race, this time not in weaponry, but in clandestine and devastating programs like the Stuxnet and Flame virus.\""}

{"text":"Interview with Jeff Moss over ICANN software glitch\n\nThe following video was released by ICANN on Thursday 19 March, one week after it has taken its application system for new Internet extensions offline. A full transcript appears below the video.\n\nBrad White (BW), ICANN Director of Media Affairs: Jeff, you're ICANN's Chief Security Officer. You were brought in to look at this glitch in the new gTLD application system, to see if it was in anyway connected with hacking or a cyber attack. What did you determine?\n\nJeff Moss (JM), ICANN Chief Security Officer: We didn't find anything. So we analyzed all the logs and looked at any other indicators that might suggest an intrusion, unusual activity, network activity. We didn't find anything.\n\nBW: So at this point, no indication of that?\n\nJM: Correct.\n\nBW: Why did you take the system offline?\n\nJM: Well, it was safest thing to do. So generally without knowing if it's a security incident, without knowing if there's a... Other persistent and may be a data corruption problem, the safest thing to do is to take it offline. The problems that, had we kept the system running, only to find out it's a bigger problem down the road would have been kind of catastrophic for us. So it's the safest, most prudent thing to do.\n\nBW: What exactly is that problem?\n\nJM: Well, under certain circumstances that were hard to replicate, users that had previously deleted a file could end up seeing the file name of another user who had uploaded the file. It's a little complicated, but what it really means is certain data was being revealed to users, who are not seeking the data that would just show up on their screen.\n\nBW: So if I understand what you're saying correctly, some applicants could see the user names and file names of other applicants.\n\nJM: Correct. But they wouldn't be able to see the contents of the file because they didn't create the file, the file commissions would prevent them from looking inside the file. But they could see the name.\n\nBW: How many applicants had the ability to view the user names or file names of others?\n\nJM: So it's definitely a minority of incidences. And we're in the process of winnowing that down even more, to be able to tell you with a much more specificity, exactly how many people.\n\nBW So you're trying to determine exactly how many people could see the file names and user names. And let me ask you the opposite question. How many users had these file names and user names potentially exposed to other applicants? Do you know that figure yet?\n\nJM: Yes, we know that figure. I'm not going to tell you that figure because we are verifying it.\n\nBW: So you are still trying to confirm that.\n\nJM: Right. So we're manually verifying it through two independent processes, and when the two independent processes match and get us the same result, we have high enough confidence that we can reveal that information.\n\nBW: You've explained what happened. Do you know what caused the issue?\n\nJM: So we're very confident that we understand what caused the issue, and we've corrected the issue. So what we're doing now is we're going back through all of our logs and analyzing exactly who was affected, and when. So with confidence we'll be able to notify everybody. Were they at risk ever, of having someone see their file name, or weren't they?\n\nBW: So you will be able to determine, it is your hope, not merely the numeric values, how many file names and user names were visible, but who might have had the ability to actually see those file names and user names?\n\nJM: Correct. We're putting everybody on notice that we know what file names and user names were displayed to what people were logged in, and when. And we want to do this very publicly because we want to prevent any monkey business. We are able to reconstruct which file names and user names were displayed.\n\nBW: So it is your hope to actually be able to determine, with a fair degree of accuracy, how much of a real problem this is.\n\nJM: Correct. We'll know very specifically.\n\nBW: Once you have the information, if I'm an applicant, and there's even a chance that my user name or file name might have been seen, will you notify me?\n\nJM: We're going to notify everyone. Whether yours was potentially seen or not, we'll notify everyone and tell them the status.\n\nBW: Was any applicant information ever compromised?\n\nJM: We have nothing to point to a compromise. We have no indicators of compromise. Everything points to a problem in the way that interrupted file deletions occurred.\n\nBW: ICANN has publicly stated that the first report of this problem was March 19, almost a month before this system was taken offline. Why the delay?\n\nJM: Well, in hindsight now, we've realized that the 19th was the first expression of this problem. But at that point in time, we had no reason to believe that there was a problem. The information that was displayed didn't make any sense to the applicant. Those appeared to be random numbers. And we never heard back anymore further information. We couldn't reproduce this problem. So only later on, when we started to see the glitch express itself did we realize that, \"Aha, something happened on the 19th that was related.\" But at that point there were no dots to connect.\n\nBW: Is this the sort of problem we could have looked for in pre-launch testing?\n\nJM: We do look for everything in pre-launch testing, and this problem did not express itself. So we're going back and analyzing exactly what our test suites were and what our test cases were to find out why wasn't this caught in testing. But we ran a pretty comprehensive test suite. And you noticed the problem only emerged at the very end of the... Toward the end of the window. Why didn't it express itself sooner? We're trying to understand that.\n\nBW: What has to happen before you reopen the application window?\n\nJM: We have to make sure that the patch we've developed is 100% accurate, and it addresses the underlying problem. Because remember it expressed itself in several different ways, and we want to make sure we don't get bitten by this bug again.\n\nBW: Why is this testing that you keep talking about such a prolonged endeavor?\n\nJM: Well, the stakes are very high, and we want to be absolutely certain when we make statements, that we understand and don't have to retract what we are saying. So we don't want to give any misinformation inadvertently to the public, and we ourselves want to understand precisely what's occurring. As we found, the problem has several ways it can express itself. And if you look at the history of this bug, this glitch. We would solve it one way, and it would appear another way. We would solve it another way, and it would appear a third way. And at some point, we were just uncomfortable feeling that we understood the core issue. And that's when we took the system offline.\n\nBW: You seem to be telling me that if ICANN is not spewing forth a whole lot of information, it's because you want to be sure you're right before you go public.\n\nJM: Right, we don't want to withhold any information. We want to be transparent. But we also don't want to speak just for the nature of speaking. We want to make sure that what we say is factual and accurate because people are making big business decisions based on this information. And we don't want to cause any more concern than what's already happening.\n\nBW: How high of a priority is the resolution of this problem within ICANN?\n\nJM: This is the number one priority at ICANN. For anybody involved in the new gTLD program, they're focused on this problem 24\/7. What we're trying to do is to be as accurate as possible. We don't want to have another problem reoccur. We want to be able to speak with authority when we tell all the applicants who has been affected and who hasn't. This is a time consuming problem, and what we're trying to do is do this right instead of trying to do it fast, and I hope everyone understands that."}

Social media is used to distribute malware for financial gain. Although used differently, both target large groups of individuals who typically are willing to share personal information and trust online links, Cyveillance said.\n\nReports\n\n\"In an age where people are encouraged to share everything from what they had for lunch on Twitter to photos of their weekend on Facebook, cyber criminals are taking advantage of the abundance of information at their fingertips in order to create targeted attacks,\" said Panos Anastassiadis, chief operating officer of Cyveillance. \"It is important for employees and organizations to be prepared beyond just implementing traditional security measures; they need to continuously educate individuals in cyber safety best practices in order to proactively protect their companies against attacks.\"\n\nIn the first half of the year, Cyveillance detected 126,644 phishing attacks, for an average of over 21,000 unique attacks per month, with the volume remaining relatively steady throughout the first two quarters, the company said.\n\nPhishing is a social engineering scam that relies on both technology and human interaction to conduct online fraud and identity theft, according to Cyveillance. Although they vary, typically phishing schemes involve spam that mimics an email from a legitimate source that is designed to steal personal information, which then is used for online fraud, identity theft, or unauthorized network access, the company said.\n\nMalware, on the other hand, is a file or application downloaded from a website or server that has properties that are both involuntary and malicious in nature. There are many types of malware programs, such as bots that launch spam and DoS attacks, as well as keyloggers and backdoor Trojan viruses designed to steal sensitive data.\n\nOverall phishing attacks dropped in the second quarter of 2010 year-over-year, according to an August study by Internet Identity.

With every new year, we see more viruses than the total number in the previous year.\"\n\nWith the healthcare sector being the leading industry in terms of data breaches, Wirth recommended that healthcare professionals be aware of the risks and use appropriate methods to manage security, and advocated white listing for single-purpose devices"}
{"text":"A New Perspective on Hackers\n\nA large body of research exists devoted to understanding and defining terms used to distinguish hackers based on their actions and beliefs. But additional terms may be needed.\n\nSkilled hackers distinguish themselves from each other using the terms white-hat, black-hat, or gray hat. White hats are generally thought to be \"ethical\" hackers who work to find vulnerabilities in computer systems and programs, and may use unauthorized entry into systems to benefit the computer security industry.\n\nConversely, black hats seek these same vulnerabilities to gain access to information or to damage a computer system or network, often making them the focus of media and law enforcement attention.\n\nGray-hat hackers fall somewhere between these two camps, having unclear or changing motives depending on the specific situation.\n\nThese classifications, however, are fluid and vary based on individual opinions of the ethical nature of hacking. There is also some hostility toward these labels within hacker subculture, suggesting these terms may act as symbolic, but non-significant identifiers. Additionally, these terms do little to improve our ability to classify and understand the increasing severity of attacks against government, business, and home computer systems and the involvement of organized crime and state-sponsored groups in hacking.\n\nDue to these issues, Max Kilger, behavioral profiler for the Honeynet Project, and I developed terminology to move beyond the somewhat arbitrary black-and-white (and gray) measurements to assess hacker activity. We initially published this framework in a paper last year.\n\nWe feel there may be greater utility in developing terms that consider the capacity of the hacker and his use of technology to more accurately reflect the impact of the norms and values of hacker subculture on human behavior. Also, these terms will allow investigators to consider all possible hacker motives, whether they be political or religious ideology, economic imperative, or simple curiosity.\n\nWe have developed two new value-neutral terms to identify and explore hacker behavior: \"techcraft\" and \"makecraft\" hackers. These words are a reflection of multiple aspects of hacker culture, interests, and actions. The word \"craft\" appears in both terms to recognize the ways that hackers manipulate technology, which appear almost magical to outsiders. We think that's appropriate; the skills required to engage in a hack are well beyond the average end user, thus taking on an otherworldly quality.\n\nIn addition, hackers have been marginalized and demonized during the growth of the information society, leading some researchers to compare this process to witchcraft trials throughout history. As such, \"craft\" is used to identify perceptions of hackers by those outside of the hacker community.\n\nThe terms \"tech\" and \"make\" are an attempt to recognize the variations in technology use across the hacker culture. Makecraft hackers are considered producers of materials, such as new scripts, tools, and attack methods that have not been seen before. These materials may have malicious, benign, or beneficial utilities, depending on the user.\n\nThe techcraft hacker is, however, more of a consumer of materials and knowledge, who applies existing information and utilities to the devices he interacts with on a daily basis. The techcraft hacker may be just as skilled as a makecraft hacker, though he may apply his knowledge more for either the repair of systems or to complete a task with known tools and materials. Makecraft hackers are more interested in using their skills to identify and solve new problems, or create and use applications that have not been seen before.\n\nThe value-neutral schema we have developed removes the notion of black, white, and gray to instead consider how the application of knowledge affects the methods and tactics of a given hacker.\n\nFor example, a phishing attack with a well known toolkit, such as Nuclear Grabber, may be performed by a techcraft hacker. A spearphishing attack using an unknown Trojan or keylogger may, however, represent the work of a makecraft hacker, as he will have developed these tools independently.\n\nAs a whole, we believe the terms \"makecraft\" and \"techcraft\" may be successfully applied to both malicious and ethical hackers to help us better focus on, understand, and document hackers' actions.\n\nI only have one probleme that estonish me on the hacking world , is how hackers would benefict from hacking online datas ? blocking a website to be under services as they targeted twitters over the last week with DOS attack , and many online services targeted , we've been worrying about google and yahoo security as well .\n\nIsn't a time to stop unhonnest actions , and do what make our web better security and more safe ?\n\nYou make a good point, but the \"labels\" that you are both lamenting and wanting to create denote extremely different attributes of the same object (to use a programming analogy). There maybe blackhat \"makecraft\" as well as whitehat \"makecraft\" \"hackers.\" (although that term, is still hotly debated, though the battle has been lost in the media...the true term should be crackers but it is not spicy enough).\n\nIf you want to convey a sense of purpose to the hacker, then the hats apply. If you want to convey a sense of \"craftsmanship\" or skill then your lablels apply. However, the community has already come up with less eloquent labels for the capacities that you seek to identify (script kiddie and 733t come to mind ;) ).\n\nThe taxonomy is what it is....trying to change it from the outside will have no effect at this late stage in the game....\n\nSure, it may seem that this is a question of semantics, but it is also a point to understand the divergence in the types of hackers.\n\nWe may be able to better classify and attacker and their habits through the use of these terms rather than just saying they are a blackhat or whitehat. So, these terms can be informed by any demographic and attitudinal knowledge that we can develop on attacker profiles.\n\nMr. Holt, With all due respect to your profession, in this specific instance it appears symantical to classify specific terms. Not that either term in and of itself are not important in the context of your line of work, but wouldn't it be more advantageous to direct your efforts in providing a composite profile of these specific characteristics to the hacker?\n\nRead Steven Levy's \"Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution\". The term hackers, originated from the MIT Model Railroad Society. It basically defined a person that would \"kludge\" together a solution for a problem.\n\nSomewhere along the line the Media industry decided to demonize the term and lump a bunch of bad citizens into it. \"Crackers\", \"ScriptKiddiez\", \"WarezDudez\" to name a few terms don't follow the Hacker's Ethic or Code and as such are not hackers.\n\nThe Code according to Steven Levy\n\nAccess to computers- and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!\n\nAll information should be free.\n\nMistrust Authority - Promote Decentralization.\n\nHackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.\n\nYou can create art and beauty on a computer.\n\nComputers can change your life for the better.\n\nI am proud to consider myself a hacker, whether it's finding that undocumented feature of Excel or extending the gas mileage of my lawn mower.\n\nWe did not develop these terms as a means of improving prosecutiorial success. Rather, we think it is helpful from a classifcation framework. If you're working in security for a financial institution or government agency, anyone who is playing around in your network or with customer data is clearly violating the law and your network space. So, the value in our scheme is identify whether this person is working with new tools and resources or acting in an innovative way that we've not seen before, or taking the same tools that we know or have seen before to cause harm rather than simply noting there is a \"black hat in the system.\"\n\nNow sure, a white hat may do this same thing and report it to the system administrator or security group, but we'd still be concerned that they got in in the first place.\n\nRecognizing the attack vector and qualities of the attacker may be more useful for classifying a threat.\n\nOn Mary's point, we would definitely try to explore and apply this framework in the field.\n\nI can see your point Tom in trying to classify hacks according to action; but as Amy R-N states below, it's still important to characterize the activity as on the side of legal networking or not. And if not, the classifications you provide then give a way to break down what kinds of bad actions are being taken is no denying the degree to which social networking sites have become part of the landscape of the Internet. And maintaining profiles across multiple sites has become a common Internet experience.\n\nWhen it comes to cybercrime, a great deal of attention has been paid to the financial damages that result from malware infection and data loss due to intrusions. A great deal of research has also been invested in understanding economic cybercrimes, such as phishing and carding.\n\nThere are constant reports about new malicious software distribution, intrusions into sensitive networks and large-scale data theft by attackers from around the globe.New software solutions and tools will certainly help to protect networks, though there is a greater security problem that will not diminish through technological means: the end users"}

{"text":"Legislation to Protect Against Cyber Attacks is Stuck in Congress; Israel Calls for Swift Passage\n\nHauppauge, NY\u2014 Today, Congressman Steve Israel (D-Huntington) joined local tech companies to call for legislation to better protect Long Island businesses and reduce our risk of a cyberattack. Technicians demonstrated how easy it is to hack into a computer and retrieve sensitive information, even with the latest anti-virus software.\n\nRep. Israel said, \"Failing to protect ourselves from cyber espionage or cyber attack is to leave our intellectual property vulnerable to theft. We know that a successful widespread and potent attack could plunge us into blackouts, devastate commerce, disrupt communications, paralyze transportation, and more. Congress must get past its partisan gridlock before our nation is truly in danger and pass legislation that would allow government agencies to share information quickly with businesses.\"\n\nPaul Trapani, CEO of Fuoco Tech, a local IT support firm, said, \"I applaud Congressman Israel's efforts to make the general public more aware of cyber security issues. A lot of people that are not in the security or computer industry are unaware of how easy it is for a cybercriminal to gain access to sensitive information. While networks and computers have gained a certain measure of security, the growing pervasiveness of wireless networks, that are often unsecured, has created potential for more attacks and security compromises. In our industry we are well aware that the moment a computer is connected to the internet it starts being scanned for vulnerabilities.\"\n\nPeter Goldsmith, President of LISnet, a network for Long Island software and technology firms, said, \"The world has been made smaller through technology, with exciting changes happening almost daily. But technology has an enemy with people trying to create problems, so the need for Cyber Security is vital at all levels, from your home to our country.\"\n\nJust last week, General Keith Alexander, the top U.S. military official in charge of protecting the United States from cyberattacks, reported a 17-fold increase in attacks against our infrastructure between 2009 and 2011. And, on a \"preparedness scale\" of one to 10, he assigned a level of only three. And our electricity grids, water supplies, computer and cell-phone networks and other infrastructure are increasingly coming under attack.\n\nThe House passed the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) in April 2012 to ensure a better response to cyberattacks by providing sensible information sharing between businesses and government. The Senate yesterday failed to end a filibuster on their Cybersecurity Act of 2012 delaying action on the measure."}

{"text":"\"Our Best Hope is that the Enemy is Drowning in Data,\" researcher says\n\nThe Zeus Trojan is well known for its use in cyber crime, allowing cyber criminals to steal millions of dollars every year. However, cyber crime is not the only capability that Zeus provides miscreants.\n\nThe amount of money presently being stolen by cyber criminals is astronomical, and yet, relatively little outcry or action has taken place. The money gleaned from cyber crime currently outstrips that made by the narcotics trade.\n\n\"Just one of the Zeus controllers steals about $10 million a week from the United States,\" according to Gary Warner, director of research in computer forensics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nConducting crime through cyberspace allows criminals to operate with relative anonymity and in nations that do not actively seek to shut down cyber crime networks. As of last week, the Zeus Tracker, based in Switzerland, documented 694 active command and control servers for the Zeus Trojan, which means there were 694 active botnets last week.\n\nHowever, the large number of botnets does not necessarily coincide with a large number of handlers. Based on extensive research by researchers at University of Alabama at Birmingham, over half of the domains registered to Zeus were actually one account, meaning one individual controlled over half of the botnets.\n\nThe researchers first asked themselves, \"How do we turn lists into intelligence?\" In response, the researchers examined domain name registration and IP address registration to track who was operating the various Zeus botnets.\n\nPerhaps of greatest concern is how Zeus can be leveraged by foreign intelligence organizations. The information collected by the Zeus Trojan could be used to provide valuable intelligence snapshots and patterns for foreign intelligence agencies.\n\nThe Zeus program works as a key logger, stealing key strokes and transmitting them to the command and control server. The Trojan also allows hackers to add any additional malware to an infected machine.\n\nThe malware users are also capable of targeting government organizations through increasingly sophisticated attacks. In an attack that targeted the government, the infected computers had their hard-drives scanned and then sent to a computer in Belarus.\n\nWarner is concerned with the threat posed by Zeus' espionage capabilities. \"Our best hope at the moment is that the enemy is drowning in data,\" he said.\n\nThere have already been several incidents that point to the involvement of FAPSI, the Russian version of the NSA, in cyber espionage operations. In 1998, a German satellite, ROSAT, was rendered useless when it was hijacked and turned towards the sun. The resulting investigation found that FAPSI likely acquired the information contained in the satellite.\n\nIn a recent string of credit card fraud in Europe, the cyber criminal gang involved in the theft was linked to FAPSI. According to Jan Eiivind Fondal, director of risk management at Europay Norge in Norway, \"We've seen techniques that could only have come from FAPSI"}
{"text":"Why Teaching Kids to Hack is a Good Thing\n\nThe More We Understand About How the Bad Guys Operate, The Better off We Will Be...\n\nI recently had the opportunity to visit Singapore and speak at a variety of IT security events, both big and small, on the subject of modern malware and network-based attacks. The subject matter was fairly dense and the audience was primarily made up of researchers, government policy makers and network security specialists. However, one thing that I noticed was that all of these events included significant numbers of high-school and college students in the audience. This struck me as a particularly smart strategy, even if some of the details went beyond their level of education.\n\nSingapore has recognized that cyber-security skills in particular will be highly strategic for the foreseeable future, and they are taking the effort to teach students about the very real-world challenges in the security landscape. This goes beyond simply teaching students how to be safe on-line; it is also preparing a new generation of cyber-security specialists that will be on the front lines fighting future information attacks. I think this is a good start that could even be extended. I believe teaching offensive approaches to security (a.k.a hacking) is going to become increasingly important for all levels of IT security students and professionals in order to be prepared for modern attacks.\n\nOf course the idea of teaching someone how to hack almost always generates a negative visceral reaction, because the assumption is that you intend to teach someone how to become a criminal. I'm certainly NOT arguing that we raise a generation of cyber-criminals.\n\nHowever, an understanding of hacking no more makes a criminal than an understanding of karate makes someone use the discipline maliciously. Either skill has the potential to be misused for bad things, but likewise, each skill can also make the student better prepared if and when bad things happen. IT security threats certainly aren't going away. However, even more important than simply being prepared for the bad-guys, a hacking methodology is simply one of the best ways to learn about technology. Great scientists, inventors and thinkers have always been tinkerers \u2013 the people who if given a radio, are apt to take it apart to find out how it works. This is what a great deal of hacking boils down to \u2013 learning how a thing actually works based on how it breaks, and how it can be repurposed. In this sense, hacking is simply applied critical thinking about technology and security. Unfortunately, the overwhelming trend is toward less understanding and critical thinking about technology, even while the use and dependence on that technology is increasing.\n\nThe past two decades have seen the rise of \"consumerization\" where technology has evolved to suit the needs of a non-technical consumer and obscure the underlying nature of how it works. The end-user is presumed to be dumb and any technical details should be hidden whenever possible. All that an end-user needs is a basic understanding of what features are available and how to drive the user interface, and in many cases this qualifies as being technical.\n\nA hacker's mentality is needed in order to provide good security. When the next great product, app or widget pops up that purports to solve a problem and of course claims to be \"safe\", a healthy portion of society needs to be able to ask the critical questions about that product. How could it break? How is the data stored? What technologies and protocols does it use? How does it depend on the browser? What information does it need to share? And how could that ultimately be used against me? Without such skills and experience it's hard for security teams, much less a consumer, to be anything more than a foil for marketing departments\u2026 and one more sitting duck for the bad guys to hit.\n\nAlong those lines, I'm pleased to see that DEFCON Kids is scheduled to be back again at this year's upcoming DEFCON event. DEFCON Kids is all about teaching kids about the importance of white-hat hacking \u2013 why you need to look for and disclose vulnerabilities, and what you can learn about technology in the process. While this is a good start, it's also probably pretty limited in scope (it is, after all, a kids event scheduled in Las Vegas in the midst a very non-kids event). However, I think a broad application of this type of education is increasingly important, and one that can be started early. The more that we understand about how the bad-guys operate, the better off we will be"}

{"text":"IT Security's Next Big Threat: Young People\n\nFirst, it was viruses. Then it was financially motivated hackers, followed by insider threats. And the next big danger? People who can't remember the Bee Gees.\n\nDuring the past two weeks, IT security managers have been getting a new warning that turns the old '60s hippie slogan -- \"Never trust anyone over 30\" -- upside down. The new message: Twenty-somethings are putting the corporate network at risk.\n\nWebcasts\n\nSince Nov. 5, three separate studies -- from Accenture, Intel, and ISACA, a major IT users group -- have indicted the youngest generation of employees as one of the enterprise's newest and most serious security risks. People under the age of 28 -- sometimes called Generation Y and sometimes called Millenials, depending on how you define the category -- are engaging in online behavior that could expose their organizations to data leakage and information theft, the studies say.\n\nThe Accenture study, published two weeks ago, queried more than 400 students and employees ranging from age 14 to age 27. It found that more than half (60 percent) of young people \"are either unaware of their companies' IT policies or are not inclined to follow them.\"\n\n\"When asked which technologies they currently use or access for work-related activities that are not supported by their employers, mid-Millennials [respondents aged 18 to 22] cited mobile phones (39 percent), open source technology (19 percent), instant messaging (27 percent), online applications (12 percent), and social networking sites (28 percent),\" Accenture says. \"Similarly, they regularly download non-standard technology from free public Web sites such as open source communities, 'mashup' and 'widget' providers.\"\n\n\"The message from Millennials is clear: To lure them into the workplace, prospective employers must provide state-of-the-art technologies,\" says Gary Curtis, managing director of Accenture Technology Consulting. \"And if their employers don't support their preferred technologies, Millennials will acquire and use them anyway. In order to acquire and retain the best talent, organizations must understand the technologies that the new workforce expects -- and then find a way to support their employees without compromising enterprise security.\"\n\nIn a study published Nov. 13, Intel and the research firm of Penn Schoen & Berland Associates offered similar conclusions. The survey of IT professionals indicates that while younger employees are having a positive impact on the enterprise and its use of cutting-edge technology, they also create a new security risk. About half of the respondents regard Generation Y as a serious security concern, according to the study.\n\nYounger employees' propensity to download non-sanctioned applications and social media tools was one of the chief reasons cited for IT professionals' concern. Risks posed by social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace were the most frequently mentioned, according to the study.\n\nInterestingly, the Intel study suggests that many IT organizations are changing their behavior to accommodate the younger employees, rather than the other way around. Nearly 30 percent of the IT pros surveyed said they have changed their IT policies to meet the demands of Gen Y, allowing employees to access their work e-mail from noncompany smartphones or other devices and, in some cases, relaxing their rules surrounding the use of social networking sites.\n\nSome respondents to the Intel survey said they believe that tools for controlling or blocking access to certain applications or sites might be effective in controlling the Gen Y problem. Others said they will look toward tools that monitor employees' online activity and flag risky behavior.\n\nIn a study published last week, IT professional association ISACA focused its attention on online shopping at work, which is a common IT concern as enterprises approach the holidays. The study, which surveyed 973 consumers and more than 3,100 IT professionals, indicates that 63 percent of employees plan to shop online from their workplace computers.\nLike the other researchers, ISACA found that the greatest danger from online shopping behavior comes from Millenials -- those in the 18 to 24 age bracket. Forty percent of Millenials in the survey said they will spend up to five hours doing online shopping from their desks this holiday season. Ironically, this group is the least concerned about the security of their work PCs; almost half said they pay more attention to the security of their home machine than to the security of their office machine.\n\n\"This survey clearly shows that younger employees are more likely to engage in online activities at work that put a business' IT infrastructure at risk,\" said Kent Anderson, a member of ISACA's Security Management Committee. \"The fact that [they] are planning to spend the equivalent of more than half a work day doing holiday shopping from their work computer, combined with their lack of concern for how secure their computer is, points to an urgent need for employee education.\"\n\nWhen end users give their workplace e-mail address to an online retailer, they can leave the enterprise network open to a variety of threats, ISACA observed. \"Yet more than two in 10 (22 percent) respondents have clicked on an e-mail link to go to a retailer's Web site from their workplace computer, and used their company e-mail address as the contact for a purchase,\" the study says. \"In addition, one in four (26 percent) respondents either does not check -- or is unsure how to check -- the security of a site before making a purchase.\"\n\nIn a parallel survey of IT professionals, ISACA found that nearly half (46 percent) believe that their companies will lose an average of $3,000 or more in productivity per employee from online holiday shopping at work. More than half (55 percent) also reported that their company permits workers to shop online, but has no strategy for educating them about the risks out"}
{"text":"Carnegie Mellon's CyLab\n\nEvery day researchers at Carnegie Mellon's CyLab confront issues of cyber security, which are complicated by frequent advancements in computing technology. As a key component to global economic growth, cyber security and sustainability affect millions of people and businesses. Accidents happen, as do intentional attacks, but CyLab researchers ensure that those disruptions are minor at worst.\n\nProtecting Information Systems\n\nOpened in 2003, CyLab is a public-private partnership between Carnegie Mellon, government, and industry to engage in research and education, and to develop the technological tools that secure, protect, and improve information systems. CyLab involves over 200 Carnegie Mellon faculty and students from eight departments and colleges, in collaboration with the CERT Coordination Center and more than 30 strategic partners. The lab has been designated a National Science Foundation (NSF) CyberTrust Center and a National Security Administration (NSA) Center for Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education.\n\nCyLab's resource rich environment includes the CyLab Mobility Research Center (MRC), which explores the various networking technologies enabling anytime-anywhere computing and communication; the CyLab Biometrics Lab a world-class multi-modal biometrics program researching critical challenges such as 3D face reconstruction, 2D pose correction, and 2D facial landmark detection; and the CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory (CUPS), improving the usability of privacy and security software and systems. CyLab also has research and education centers in Greece, Japan, Portugal, Taiwan, and Silicon Valley.\n\nWhereas many security teams are reactionary, CyLab partners invest heavily in research in next-generation response and prediction technologies, threat prediction modeling, business risk analysis and economic implications, and resilient self-healing networks and computer systems, among other fields. The proactive approach and global perspective provide researchers with the necessary tools to compete with ever-increasing challenges.\n\nHappy Birthday, CyLab\n\nIn honor of CyLab's 5th birthday, the university hosted the 2008 Annual Partners Conference, October 6-8, to celebrate the vital research that has defined the center as the premier institution for cyber security education and research.\n\nThe conference included presentations and roundtable discussions between partners and researchers, as well as updates by faculty on research advances in mobility, next-generation secure Internet, available and secure network and communication, secure home computing, access to devices and spaces, available and secure systems and services, and protecting privacy and confidentiality of information.\n\nDuring his keynote address, Chris Inglis, deputy director of the NSA, remarked that \"the virtual world has overrun the physical, creating a situation where, at least for information, physical barriers no longer equate to separation, let alone sanctuary\u2026Our ability to connect to everything, yields the obvious and sobering prospect that everything out there has the ability to connect to us.\" Bill Cheswick, lead member of the technical staff at AT&T, also spoke at the conference.\n\nAlthough Inglis's observation might make some computer users apprehensive, he reassured the community that \"increased awareness of cyber security issues, new standards, better education, expanded information sharing, more uniform practices, and improved technology can and do make a meaningful difference.\" Like all work at Carnegie Mellon, CyLab's mission is to actualize that meaningful difference.\n\nSome Much-Deserved Recognition\n\nSince its inception, CyLab has been recognized as a world leader in cyber technology. MIT Technology Review highlighted CyLab researcher and ECE Professor Marios Savvides's work on super-resolution facial recognition and iris scanning software, as well as robots that inspect and pick up roadside explosives\u2014inquiries which could save lives on the battlefield.\n\n\"This is what makes [me and my graduate students] work until 5 a.m.,\" said Savvides, in an interview with Pittsburgh's WTAE. Although the research is still ongoing, breakthroughs are happening everyday.\n\nSavvides isn't the only one making headlines: Dena Haritos Tsamitis, director of education, training, and outreach for CyLab and director of Carnegie Mellon's Information Networking Institute (INI), recently received the prestigious 2008 Women of Influence Award. Given by Alta Associates and CSO Magazine, the award recognizes her outstanding professional and academic leadership in developing innovative information-security education programs. Tsamitis is a founding member of CyLab and a mentor for women in the global workforce.\n\nShortly after the Partners Meeting, the NSF awarded a $300,000 grant to CyLab and the INI to help minority institutions offer quality information assurance education. The two-year workshop will help the institutions develop curricula inspired by the innovative work at Carnegie Mellon. Tsamitis will play a key role in the program's development.\n\nLooking Toward the Future\n\nSpeaking about our shared interest in security and information assurance, Inglis noted that the Partners Conference provided \"another valuable opportunity to inform not only in the matter of challenges and potential solutions, but to discuss how to increase the collaboration that will be essential to our collective security.\"\n\nWhile completely ridding the world of cyber security issues may be a long way off, with help from government and industry, CyLab faculty can explore new avenues of research, which will ensure our security, both physical and financial.\n\nTo learn more about how to become a CyLab partner, please contact Gene Hambrick, CyLab's Director of Corporate Relations."}

{"text":"Cyber-security has become a strategic issue. But while offensive cyber-operations are becoming a significant component of modern conflicts, Myriam Dunn Cavelty argues that the role of the military in cyber-security will be limited and still needs to be carefully defined.\n\nBy\nMyriam Dunn Cavelty\nfor Center for Security Studies (CSS)\n\nAuthor's Note: This article was published in March 2012. It has since been confirmed (at least unofficially) that the United States government was behind the programming of the computer worm called 'Stuxnet', which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program. In June 2012, a New York Times article revealed that Stuxnet was part of a U.S. and Israeli intelligence operation called 'Olympic Games'. The certain knowledge that the world's biggest military superpower is actively engaging in cyber-operations has most likely triggered even more research into offensive capabilities worldwide, with the result of a growing cyber-security dilemma: more and more states are already making more or less subtle shows of cyber-capabilities, likely to act as deterrent. Still, the main argument of this article remains unchanged: military capabilities, both offensive and defensive, are simply not enough to ensure cyber-security (and are more likely to create more cyber-in-security). Cyber-security is and remains an issue that needs to be tackled as a shared responsibility between public and private actors.\n\nOver the last few years, cyber security has been catapulted from the confined realm of technical experts into the political limelight. The discovery of the industry- sabotaging Stuxnet computer worm, numerous tales of (Chinese) cyber espionage, the growing sophistication of cyber criminals, and the well-publicised activities of hacker collectives have combined to give the impression that cyber attacks are becoming more frequent, more organised, more costly, and altogether more dangerous. As a result, a growing number of countries consider cyber security to be one of the top security issues of the future.\n\nThis is just the latest 'surge' of attention in the three- to four-decade-long history of cyber issues. The importance attached to cyber security in politics grew steadily in response to a continual parade of incidents such as computer viruses, data theft, and other penetrations of networked computer systems, which, combined with heightening media attention, created the feeling that the level of cyber insecurity was on the rise. As a result, the debate spread in two directions: up- wards, from the expert level to executive decision-makers and politicians; and horizontally, advancing from mainly being an issue of relevance to the US to the top of the threat list of more and more countries.\n\nThe debate on 'cyber security' originated in the US in the 1970s, built momentum in the late 1980s, and spread to other countries in the late 1990s. Early on, US policy-makers politicised the issue. They presented cyber security as a matter that requires the attention of state actors because it cannot be solved by market forces. As concern increased, they securitised the issue: They represented it as a challenge requiring the urgent attention of the national security apparatus. In 2010, against the background of the Stuxnet incident, the tone and intensity of the debate changed even further: The latest trend is to frame cyber security as a strategic-military issue and to focus on countermeasures such as cyber offence and defence, or cyber deterrence.\n\nThough this trend can easily be understood when considering the political (and psychological) effects of Stuxnet, it nonetheless invokes images of a sup- posed adversary even though there is no identifiable enemy, is too strongly focused on national security measures instead of economic and business solutions, and wrongly suggests that states can establish control over cyberspace. Not only does this create an unnecessary atmosphere of insecurity and tension in the international system, it is also based on a severe misperception of the nature and level of cyber risk and on the feasibility of different protection measures. While it is undisputed that the cyber dimension will play a substantial role in future conflicts of all grades and shades, threat-representations must remain well informed and well balanced at all times in order to rule out policy reactions with excessively high costs and uncertain benefits.\n\nThis chapter first describes the core elements of the cyber security debate that emerged over the past decades. These elements provide the stage and scenery for the more recent trend of increasing militarisation of cyber security. Five factors responsible for this trend are described in section two. The effects of the discovery of Stuxnet as the culmination point of the cyber threat story are the focus of section three: Though the actual (physical) damage of Stuxnet remains limited, it had very real and irreversible political effects. The fourth section critically assesses the assumptions underlying the trend of militarisation and their negative effects. The chapter concludes by arguing that military countermeasures will not be able to play a significant role in cyber security due to the nature of the information environment and the nature of the threat. Finally, it sketches the specific, though limited role that military apparatuses can and should play in reducing the overall level of cyber insecurity nation- ally and internationally.\n\nThe backdrop of the cyber security debate\n\nThe combination of telecommunications with computers in the late 1970s and the 1980s \u2013 the basis of the cur- rent information revolution \u2013 marks the beginning of the cyber threat debate. The launch and subsequent spread of the personal computer created a rise in tech-savvy individuals, some of whom started to use the novel networked environment for various sorts of misdeeds. In the 1990s, the information domain became a force- multiplier by combining the risks to cyberspace (widespread vulnerabilities in the information infrastructure) with the possibility of risks through cyberspace (actors exploiting these vulnerabilities). The two core elements of the cyber security debate that pro- vide the stable backdrop for the cur- rent trend of militarisation emerged: A main focus on highly vulnerable critical infrastructures as 'referent object' (that which is seen in need of protection) and the threat representation based on the inherent insecurity of the information infrastructure and the way it could be manipulated by technologically skilful individuals.\n\nFrom government networks to critical infrastructures\n\nInitially, the overarching concern of the US was with the classified in- formation residing in government information systems. As computer networks grew and spread into more and more aspects of everyday life, this focus changed. A link was established in the strategic community between cyber threats and so-called 'critical infrastructures', which is the name given to assets whose incapacitation or destruction could have a debilitating impact on the national security and\/ or economic and social welfare of the entire nation.\n\nThis threat perception was influenced by the larger strategic context that emerged for the US after the Cold War. It was characterised by more dynamic geostrategic conditions, more numerous areas and issues of concern, and smaller, more agile, and more diverse adversaries. As a result of the difficulties to locate and identify enemies, the focus of security policies partly shifted away from actors, capabilities, and motivations to general vulnerabilities of the entire society. In addition, the influence of globalisation on the complex interdependence of societies around the world and their growing technological sophistication led to a focus on security problems of a trans- national and\/or technological nature. The combination of vulnerabilities, technology, and transnational issues brought critical infrastructures to centre stage, particularly because they were becoming increasingly dependent on the smooth functioning of all sorts of computer-related applications, such as software-based control systems.\n\nThe basic nature of the cyber threat\n\nThe networked information environment \u2013 or cyberspace \u2013 is pervasively insecure, because it was never built with security in mind. The dynamic globalisation of information services in connection with technological innovation led to a steady increase of connectivity and complexity. The more complex an IT system is, the more problems it contains and the harder it is to control or manage its security. The commercialisation of the Internet led to an even further security deficit, as there are significant market- driven obstacles to IT security.\n\nThese increasingly complex and global information networks seemed to make it much easier to attack the US asymmetrically: Potentially devastating attacks now only required a computer with an Internet connection and a handful of 'hackers', members of a distinct social group (or sub- culture) who are particularly skilled programmers or technical experts. In the borderless environment of cyber- space, hackers can exploit computer insecurities in various ways. In particular, digitally stored information can be delayed, disrupted, corrupted, destroyed, stolen, or modified.\n\nIntruders can also leave 'backdoors' to come back at a later time, or use the hijacked machine for attacks on other machines. Though most individuals would be expected to lack the motivation to cause violence or severe economic or social harm, large sums of money might sway them to place their specialised knowledge at the disposal of actors with hostile intent like terrorists or foreign states. In addition, attackers have little to fear in terms of retribution. Sophisticated cyber attacks cannot be attributed to a particular perpetrator, particularly not within a short timespan. The main reasons are the often hidden nature of exploits and the general architecture of cyberspace, which allows online identities to be hidden."}
{"text":"Warfare: Missile Can Cripple Computers\n\nScientists are a step closer to developing a weapon that could change modern warfare with its potential to target cyber terrorists and disable enemy nuclear facilities by blowing up their computer systems.\n\nIn a desert in the US state of Utah, scientists working on the Counter-electronics High-powered Microwave Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP) fired the rocket along a pre-programmed flight path. The microwaves it emitted permanently disabled computers inside a nearby military compound.\n\nIn fact, the first test was so successful, even the camera recording it is reported to have stopped working."}
{"text":"A hacker wearing a fake beard and dark sunglasses took the stage at a computer security conference in Miami on Thursday and showed a group of about 60 security researchers how to intercept the radio communications between Silver Spring Networks, a maker of smart grid technology, and its clients, which include major utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric and Pepco Holdings.\n\nThe hacker, who goes by the moniker Atlas, stopped short of showing how to inflict damage to these systems, but the implication of his presentation was clear: If you can understand the way these systems speak to one another, the potential to hack them is very real. And, the logic continues, if you can hack these systems, then you could tinker with an oil or gas pipeline, or cause a power failure.\n\nPerhaps the reason he \"stopped short of showing how to inflict damage to these systems\" is because he can't. As far as I can tell from this article, he's intercepting encrypted communications, and if he can't decrypt them, then the system is working as designed. But it would be too much to ask the NYT to think critically about the dots a guy in a disguise is connecting.\n\nThis is a good piece on how Internet-connected devices like pacemakers, smart meters, and coffee machines are designed without much thought given to security. This is true and articles like this one thankfully sound the alarm. But what to make of this:\n\nThe same thing was true of computer-software companies, he pointed out. Not until credit-card numbers by the millions began to be stolen did they begin to pay attention. \"We live in a reactive society,\" McClure went on, \"and something bad has to happen before we take problems seriously. Only when these embedded computers start to kill a few people\u2014one death won't do it\u2014will we take it seriously.\"\n\nIs this a lament? I for one wouldn't like to live in a 'proactive' society where innovation took a back seat to security and we had to be sure something was safe before it was allowed. Yeah, some harm is going to have to happen (not just speculated) before the market reacts, and that's a feature, not a bug.\n\nAllegedly stolen from PricewaterhouseCooper's Tennessee office on Aug. 25. The group wants $1 million in bitcoins from Romney by September 28 or they say they will make them public. So lulzy if real, but why would they make their extortion demand public if it's true?\n\nThat's the proposition I am defending in a week-long online debate at The Economist versus Symantec CTO Greg Day. Please check out our opening statements, and by all means feel free to vote for my side.\n\nBy the way, didn't it just come out inThe Washington Post that the United States helped attack Iran with Flame, Stuxnet and related programs? If they did this to us, wouldn't we consider it an act of war? Didn't we just take a major step toward militarizing the internet? Doesn't it seem plausible to you that the cyber-assault is not yet over and thus we face immediate questions looking forward? Won't somebody fairly soon try to do it to us? Won't it encourage substitution into more dangerous biological weapons?\n\nThose are good questions. Let's take them in turn.\n\nIf they did it to us, would we consider it an act of war? I tend to agree with Franz-Stefan Gady's perspective that Stuxnet should not be considered an act of war. One of the most overlooked aspects of the great reporting done by the NYT and WaPo uncovering the details of Stuxnet is that the U.S. did not \"hack in\" to Iran's nuclear facilities from thousands of miles away. Instead it had to rely on Israel's extensive intelligence apparatus to not only understand the target, but to deliver the worm as well. That is, humans had to physically infiltrate Iran's operations to engage in the spying and then the sabotage.\n\nEspionage is not an act of war under international law. Nations expect and tolerate espionage as an inevitable political practice. Spies are sometimes prosecuted criminally when caught, sometimes traded for other spies, and often simply expelled from the country. Sabotage I'm less certain about, but I think it inhabits a similar space as espionage: frowned up, prosecuted criminally, but not an act of war per se. (I've been trying to find the answer to that question in vein, so if any international law experts would like to send me the answer, I'd appreciate it.)\n\nSo what do we have with Flame? It's essentially spying, albeit in a frighteningly efficient manner. But, it's not act of war. Stuxnet is similarly not an act of war if we assume sabotage is not. There's little difference between Stuxnet and a spy infiltrating Natanz and throwing a wrench into the works. Stuxnet is just the wrench. Now, it's key to point out what makes Stuxnet political sabotage and not terrorism, and that is that there were no deaths, much less civilian deaths.\n\nDid we take a big step in militarizing the Internet? Won't somebody fairly soon try to do it to us? Well, it's already happening and it's been happening for years. U.S. government networks are very often the subject of espionage\u2014and maybe even sabotage\u2014by foreign states. If something feels new about Stuxnet, it's that for the first time we have definitive attribution to a state. As a result, the U.S. loses moral high ground when it comes to cybersecurity, and if someone doing it to the U.S. gets caught, they will be able to say, \"You started it.\" But they're already doing it. Not that it's necessarily a good thing, but the militarization of cyberspace is not just inevitable, it's been well underway for some time.\n\nFinally, Tyler asks, Won't it encourage substitution into more dangerous biological weapons? The answer to that, I think, is a definitive no. \"Cyber weapons\" are completely different from biological weapons and even chemical or conventional, and certainly nuclear. For one thing, they are nowhere nearas dangerous. No one has ever died from a cyber attack. Again, short of already being in a shooting war, these capabilities won't be employed beyond espionage and surgical sabotage like Stuxnet.\n\nThat raises the question, however, if we're in a shooting war with a Lybia or a Syria, say, will they resort to cyber? Perhaps, but as Thomas Rid has pointed out, the more destructive a \"cyber weapon\" the more difficult and costly it is to employ. Massively so. This is why it's probably only the U.S. at this point who has the capability to pull off an operation as difficult as Stuxnet, and then only with the assistance of Israel's existing traditional intelligence operation. Neither al Qaeda, nor Anonymous, nor even Iran will be able to carry out an operation on the same level as Stuxnet any time soon.\n\nSo, Tyler, you can sleep well. For now at least. ;o) Yes, we should have a national discussion about what sorts of weapons we want our government employing, and what sort of authorization and oversight should be required, but we should not panic or think we're a few keystrokes away from Armageddon. The more important question to me is, why does one keeps $2.85 million in bitcoin?\n\nOne [DHS] official used a technique known as \"spear fishing\" to gain access to his colleague's computer. With spear fishing, a hacker targets a computer user with an email containing an infected attachment.\n\nIn the demonstration, the official sent an email pretending to be his colleague's boss. The email included an attachment that appeared to be a copy of the Lieberman-Collins cybersecurity bill, but actually included malicious code. The hacker was then able to download confidential documents from the infected computer and even activate and view video from the computer's webcam.\n\nI'd like to know what part of the Liberman-Collins bill would prevent spear fishing attacks.\n\nI don't think you have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out what is going on here. You've had three leaks of intelligence that paint the president as a strong leader. I don't think it's an accident that you have three stories within about 45 days that paint the Obama administration as being effective in the war on terror at our national security detriment.\n\nWhat's amazing to me about this is that the outrage is over the leaks (and their political consequences), not the fact that the president (and his predecessor) unilaterally ordered a cyberattack on another country. Dennis Kucinich seems to be the only one pointing this out.\n\nThis is a delicate issue since the Pentagon's own cyber strategy holds that \"computer sabotage coming from another country can constitute an act of war.\" At what point does executive control over covert activities cross the line? Is it good enough to brief just a few friendlies in Congress (and then swear them to secrecy)? Those are the question we should be debating.\n\n\n\nPreet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, in the NYT:\n\nThe alarm bells sound regularly: cybergeddon; the next Pearl Harbor; one of the greatest existential threats facing the United States. With increasing frequency, these are the grave terms officials invoke about the menace of cybercrime \u2014 and they're not understating the threat.\n\nAlso from the NYT, check out this archive of the 100+ stories they ran on \"the Y2K Problem.\"\n\nOne thing Mr. Bharara is right about, though, is the need for breach disclosure laws.\n\nThe unusually tight collaboration with Israel was driven by two imperatives. Israel's Unit 8200, a part of its military, had technical expertise that rivaled the N.S.A.'s, and the Israelis had deep intelligence about operations at Natanz that would be vital to making the cyberattack a success.\n\nWithout the extensive knowledge the Israelis had acquired about Natanz, and without their ability to get the worm into Natanz, the project would likely not have been possible. That is, the cybermagic depended on an elaborate, expensive and dangerous old-school spying operation. Again, cyberweapons like Stuxnet are not within reach of groups like Al Qaeda or Anonymous. Not even Iran today."}
{"text":"Send this story to a friend\n\nComputer defense system proposed\n\nScientists at the University of California at Los Angeles are developing a new tool that could prevent computer network operators from becoming unwitting hosts for a particularly harmful Internet-based threat: the distributed denial of service attack.\n\nDistributed denial of service attacks -- or DDoS -- have interrupted service on Web sites like Yahoo, eBay, CNN and Amazon, and university campus networks nationwide have been shut down by them. A report released Sept. 18 by the federal President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board has called upon universities to do more to protect their networks from Internet attacks.\n\nPeter Reiher, adjunct associate professor of computer science at UCLA's Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, claims a program called D-WARD could protect entire networks from being used as launch pads for destructive computer attacks. \"D-WARD is a defense system that, when deployed on a network, will detect and stop attacks from being launched from that network,\" Mr. Reiher said.\n\nIn a DDoS attack, the victim's computer is hit by tens of thousands of data streams that quickly overload the network, denying service to legitimate users. A hacker initiates an attack by tapping into a number of computer networks, gaining control over thousands of machines, and causing each machine to generate traffic toward a particular target. Individual users may not even realize they have become unwilling participants in a coordinated attack. Hackers use automated tools to compromise an agent computer or network within five seconds. Several thousand agents can be compromised in less than an hour.\n\nD-WARD, an acronym for DDoS netWork Attack Recognition and Defense, protects networks from becoming would-be launch pads for an external hacker by stopping the crippling traffic streams before they have traveled very far, the UCLA researchers said Tuesday.\n\n\"Attacks can be stopped before they enter the Internet and blend with all the other traffic on its way to the victim,\" Mr. Reiher said. \"Being close to the source can make it easier to trace an attack back to its origins"}
{"text":"NASA still falling short on IT security\n\nUnencrypted laptops, unpatched software and advanced attacks from hackers are putting US technical know-how at risk if NASA doesn't take a stronger IT security stance, according to a report released by the agency's inspector general.\n\nNASA is a regular target of cyber attacks due to its more than 550 systems that house \"information highly sought after by criminals,\" wrote NASA Inspector General Paul K. Martin.\n\nMartin's testimony before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology summarized previous Inspector General audits of NASA IT security and made recommendations for the space agency.\n\nNASA reported 5408 computer security incidents in 2010 and 2011 that resulted in either malicious software installed on its systems or unauthorized intrusions, Martin wrote.\n\nThe resulting theft of export-controlled data and other information cost the agency more than US$7 million, Martin wrote.\n\n\"NASA needs to improve agency-wide oversight of the full range of its IT assets,\" he wrote.\n\nOne problem area: laptops. As of the beginning of this month, only 1 per cent of NASA's laptops and portable devices were encrypted. Between April 2009 and April 2011, 48 mobile computing devices with sensitive data were stolen or lost, the report said.\n\nIn another area of weakness, only 24 per cent of applicable computers on a mission network were monitored for critical software patches, the report said. Only 62 per cent were monitored for technical vulnerabilities, according to an Inspector General audit from May 2010.\n\nIn fiscal 2011, NASA was also targeted by 47 \"advance persistent threats\", or cyber attacks that seek to steal data while being undetected for a long period of time.\n\nThirteen of those attacks successfully compromised agency computers, Martin wrote. In one of those attacks, intruders stole credentials of more than 150 NASA employees, which could have been used to gain access to NASA systems.\n\nAnother attack, which originated from Chinese-based Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, targeted the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In that attack, the intruders \"gained full access to key JPL systems and sensitive user accounts.\"\n\n\"The attackers had full functional control over these networks,\" the report said.\n\nIn another area, auditors found that NASA failed to properly erase computers used for the Space Shuttle program before offering the machines for sale.\n\nInvestigators discovered \"excessed hard drives in an unsecured dumpster accessible to the public at one center,\" the report said.\n\nComments\n\nUnbelievable! Maybe UN encrypted laptops are not a good idea. It just infuriates me to know that we can not get our intellectual resource to support some common sence. We need to demand that this does not ever happen again! I do not think that is to much to expect! Also this should have more news coverage than Whitney did"}

{"text":"Security breaches and how attackers break in to networks and systems are difficult to explain and conceptualize because of all the moving parts involved in an attack. Data visualization of these complex attacks is effective because it shifts the balance between perception and cognition to take fuller advantage of the brain's abilities. Seeing (i.e visual perception) which is handled by the visual cortex located in the rear of the brain, is extremely fast and efficient. We see immediately, with little effort. Thinking (i.e. cognition), which is handled primarily by the cerebral cortex in the front of the brain, is much slower and less efficient. The more we can gleam from a picture the more likely the oft quoted phrase \"a picture is worth a thousand words\" is true.\n\nWhile there are only a couple of books on visualization of security events, most is focus on presenting security data such as facts and figured visually. The tide is changing though as we are seeing more people start to actual perform visualizations of attacks. These visualization convey much more data than a table ever could.\n\nBen Reardon, a fellow Honeynet project member, who created the visualization wrote on his company's website that \"with the increase in popularity of VoIP telephony, attacks are becoming more prevalent. The compromise of a VoIP system can cost the victim over $100,000 in real cash. For example, an Australian based company suffered $120,000 in toll fraud as a result of a VOIP compromise.\"\n\nHere's a brief primer so you'll know what's actually going on:\n\nThe purple bubbles to the left of the screen represent user accounts belonging to people who sign up for VOIP phone services like Skype.\n\nThe tiny white and red bubbles are malicious scans from the hacker's computer that are executed as a way of breaking into customer accounts to steal passwords.\n\nThe green bubbles represent imposter data or in cyberspeak \"honeypots\" that the server sends to intercept the scans and prevent them from compromising user's accounts.\n\nHoneypots are a lot of fun for security professionals. We get to trick the tricksters who try to trick security systems. These opportunities give us whitehats a chance to be a little devious for once and get in the heads of those we are protecting against.\n\nSo Microsoft conducted a little honeypot of their own to collect some data on the kinds of automated password attacks hackers are using to break into user accounts. They created a fake FTP server and allowed hackers to go to town trying to crack the password for about a year. The FTP logged and processed the information gathered by login attempts.\n\nThe honeypot gathered hundreds of user names and tens of thousands of password that have been used in automated attacks. The data told us a few things we already knew, basically that the most common password hack attempts resemble the most commonly used passwords. But the data told us one new thing that we did not already know about password cracking. That is, simply having a long password isn't good enough anymore if it is still dictionary-based. The honeypot attackers routinely used passwords 8-10 characters in length and would even try passwords 10, 15, or 20 characters long. Also, hackers are persistent, even for using automated systems. One tenacious attacker attempted 400,000 passwords to crack the fake FTP.\n\nThe emphasis on password strengthening is now more relevant than ever with the reemergence of \"L0phtCrack\" \u2013 a password auditing software. L0phtCrack attempts to crack passwords at swift speeds by scanning through a dictionary of words and forming probable password guesses. Basically, it does the exact same thing as the automated password crackers the hackers use, but for whitehat purposes. Of course, critics are worried that L0phtCrack is a double-edged sword since it could be used for that very purpose.\n\nPasswords are actually the easiest security measure to ensure protection. As long as your password follows the basic password strengthening guidelines \u2013 length, alphanumerical, case variance, special characters, etc \u2013 it should never be cracked. At least, not by an automated tool."}

{"text":"Is it really easy to hack NASA computers?\n\nA NASA official recently stated that a stolen laptop contained algorithms used to control the International Space Station. This incident is one of many breaches of NASA's security that have occurred over the past two years.\n\nBy\nTrevor Quirk, Contributor \/\nMarch 1, 2012\n\nNighttime view from the International Space Station shows the Atlantic coast of the United States. NASA recently admitted that the algorithms used to control the station were leaked through a stolen laptop.\n\nThis isn't the first report of a NASA device, such as a cell phone or a laptop, being compromised. Between 2009 and 2011 the agency reported the loss or theft of 48 devices, some of which housed personal employee information along with proprietary technical details and important financial data.\n\nYet this is only a small part of a much larger problem that has been troubling NASA for the past two years.\n\nLast week, the investigative panel of House Committee on Science, Space and Technology held a hearing to examine NASA's exposure to cyberattacks and information theft. In a written statement to the committee, NASA's Inspector General, Paul K. Martin, told the panel that between 2010 and 2011, \"NASA reported 5,408 computer security incidents that resulted in the installation of malicious software on or unauthorized access to its systems.\"\n\nIt's difficult to measure NASA's data security problems against those of other federal agencies. \"NASA OIG is the only Office of Inspector General that regularly conducts international network intrusion cases,\" read Martin's statement. \"[T]his fact could skew perceptions with regard to NASA's relative rate of significant intrusion events compared to other agencies.\"\n\nNASA is taking steps to guard its data, a task that is not proving easy. Perhaps the most fundamental impediment to NASA's security upgrade is the sheer size of the agency. Information in NASA is constantly cycling around 550 individual networks that span the globe. Hundreds of thousands of people, including NASA personnel, contractors, academics, and members of the public access and communicate through these networks.\n\nNASA spends over $1.5 billion on information technology each year, $58 million of which is allotted for security.\n\nThe official charged with overseeing the activity of these networks \u2013 Chief Information Officer Linda Y. Curteon \u2013 lacks access to key information about it. What's worse, when the CIO does identify a problem, she does not always have the proper authority to deal with it.\n\nNASA currently monitors its networks with a \"snap-shot\" model, where updates on security are only given every so often, much like a baby monitor that broadcasts only for a few minutes each hour. The time between updates is a window of opportunity for potential hackers. For years, NASA has been trying to adopt a continuous security model.\n\nThe loss or theft of NASA's mobile devices would not be such a threat to security if the agency knew what sensitive information was stored on them, and that the devices were encrypted. During the hearing, Martin stated that 99% of these devices were not.\n\nThese many problems have rendered NASA vulnerable to much more serious threats, such as large-scale, sophisticated cyber-attacks.\n\n\"The individuals or nations behind these attacks are typically well organized and well funded and often target high profile organizations like NASA,\" Martin said. There were 47 such attacks on NASA in 2011, 13 of which were successful. During one attack, intruders acquired the credentials of 150 employees who had access to NASA's systems. In another, attackers, operating from a Chinese-based IP address, gained access to key systems of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and high-profile user accounts. \"In other words,\" said Martin, \"the attackers had full functional control over these networks.\"\n\nNASA's internal investigations have suggested that the sophistication of cyber-attacks is increasing. Some have even involved large foreign companies and underground internet-service providers. The recent spate of thefts and intrusions seems to demonstrate that online criminals have begun to see NASA's vulnerabilities as opportunities"}

Simply put, it is easier and cheaper to steal rather than develop the legal way. China has consistently denied it has any responsibility for hacking that originated from servers on its soil, but \u2014 based on what is known of attacks from China, Russia and other countries \u2014 a declassified estimate of the value of the blueprints, chemical formulas and other material stolen from U.S. corporate computers in the last year reached almost $500 billion\"\n\nI'm sure the Chinese government has their crack team of hackers, just like we do. Having said that...\n\nI run a honeypot at work. 70% of the attacks do come from Chinese machines, but I suspect that's because the Chinese buy those $2 pre-hacked warez'd Windows CD's at the market and don't install security updates.\n\nOf the actual living, breathing hackers that log into my honeypot, 1\/3 of them come from Romanian IP's, and another 1\/3 come from other eastern European countries, but the text files\/strings in their utilities are Romanian. Wired has a good article which partly corroborates this.\n\nI see two modes of attack. 98% are single machines launching 100's of attacks. 70% of those are in China. The other 2% are distributed attacks. These are more likely to be major power intelligence agencies, and don't have anywhere near the geographic concentration as the single-machine attacks (Chinese IP's are 15% of distributed attacks, same as Brazil).\n\nTLDR: English-speaking nations around the world have conspired to use their signals intelligence capability (ECHELON) to engage in industrial espionage and pass trade secrets on to their own corporations."}

It may not sound like much, but a college professor gets paid about $150 per month.\n\n\"The Russian hacking scene is incredibly sophisticated,\" said Ken Dunham, senior analyst at Security Focus. \"These guys are excellent programmers and they really understand networks --- how to get in and out without a trace.\"\n\nRussian crackers have been at the center of some notorious computer crime cases.\n\nVladimir Levin, in one of the first online theft cases to be prosecuted, was sentenced to three years in prison for removing $3.7 million from various Citibank accounts in 1995. Levin accomplished this with a personal computer and a dial-up connection to the Internet.\n\nMore recently, in October 2000, Microsoft discovered that its network had been breached, admitted that the crackers had probably had a good look at software projects under development, and said that the trail led back to an address in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\n\"Russian crackers do amazing things with very limited computing power. They are smart and they cover their tracks very well,\" said Frank Voden, a consultant with U.K. firm TechSolutions.\n\n\"And they have excellent programming skills, which many of the so-called crackers in the U.S. do not possess. These Russian guys aren't just downloading tools and running them without knowing what they are doing. They know exactly what they are doing.\"\n\nAlexei Badkhen, a 32-year-old Moscow resident, who describes himself as a \"secret security guy,\" said that cracking and hacking is an important part of the underground culture in Russia, as it is in many other countries.\n\nBut he feels that there is more approval for Russia's crackers throughout Russia than there is elsewhere.\n\n\"When I was in school, in the 1980s, we were encouraged to hack American software. We had to dissect the programs to understand them so that we could make them work on our systems,\" he said. \"So we say we were the first country to have a hacker culture. And Russia gives excellent technical education, but you have many highly skilled people with no jobs.\"\n\nBadkhen believes that many Russian teenagers start cracking because they want to get on the Internet but can't afford the costs of the service. So they learn how to steal passwords.\n\n\"Plus, the person says, 'How can I afford to spend two months' salary on a copy of (Microsoft) Office? I cannot,'\" Badkhen said. \"But I can spend a half-month salary and get a CD burner that lets me make many copies of software. What is the better investment?\"\n\nBadkhen said that hacking and cracking is a fairly open activity in Russia, and said he often goes to Moscow's Gorbushka market to purchase pirated copies of software and CDs filled with the latest cracking tools.\n\n\"We don't download the tools so much, as you maybe would in other countries, because our connections to the Internet are slow and the phone service goes bad a lot,\" he said. \"So we trade by CD at the markets.

{"text":"This report actually tells that with a few exceptions, the grid is protected in the way that federal regulations require. It then goes on to say that federal regulations are not strict enough. It comes up with \"tens of thousands of attacks\" where everyone that knows what this is about will know that these are a few standard port scans. If you count every package as a single attack, you'll get into big numbers easily. It claims destruction of tens of thousands of hard drives at an Arab oil company, while in truth, these drives weren't damaged, but the contents of them was wiped or changed due to a large scale virus infection. The company had good backups in place and as far as is publicly known, no significant amount of relevant data was lost. The entire attack did cost a lot of money, but nothing vitally critical was damaged and the company is still in business today. I'm not sure, but I doubt the attack even hindered them pumping or selling a single gallon of oil.\n\nThe biggest actual threat the report can come up with is physical damage to large distribution station transformers. To damage these, physical action, not cyber, will have to be taken. This is out of scope of the research and should have been kept out of the report.\n\nThere are many good recommendations in the report that will improve resilience and resistance against cyber attacks on the US national power grid. However, the tone and exaggeration of the report will make it hard for professionals to take it seriously and for politicians to \"do the right thing\" and get the things in place to make the recommendations become true.\n\nThis was not about the 80% spending rule. This was about the financial data on one individual, that just happened to be an employee at this company. If he worked at McDonalds, they'd have been pulling records on 60 million hamburgers.\n\nIf companies have trouble advertising because they don't want to sell stuff for a different price in each town, they should uniform the end price and deal with the taxes themselves. They have to pay a different rent on the building they have in each town, they have different wages for their staff, heating costs differ, lots of things differ. I don't see them putting those in the price of each item in every single store individually. Why make an exemption for local taxes for that? This way, people are being lead to believe something is cheap and they will spend more than they can afford. It's human nature to do so, however predictable and preventable. This is a sales trick and it will be in the consumers benefit if they have to stop doing that. Since everyone in the USA is a consumer and only a few percent are a company, there's a clear majority here that will profit from such a law. Companies can't vote, consumers can. The fact that companies still get to do this, shows how much democracy is effective in the USA.\n\nWhether or not the information is encrypted is not important in this case. It may be to you, but it's not to the party you are dealing with. The big deal is that you can be reasonably assured that you are in fact dealing with that party and not someone imposing as them, or someone intercepting the communications between you and them. HTTPS will always sign each data transmission, making it virtually impossible to alter the data under way or to have someone else impose you.\n\nHTTPS is seldom about privacy, especially with all the monitoring, tracking and statistics going on. Try visiting the web without google or facebook getting cookies and tracking data on you, regardless of you visiting a site that uses HTTPS or HTTP. You can, but you'll have to go through great length to do so.\n\nThe data being sent back to you, goes to an e-mail provider you trust. If you don't trust them, you wouldn't be using them. The information you gave to the website is something that isn't that sensitive that you wouldn't want \"strangers\" to have. If it was, you wouldn't be handing it over to some web site. Yes, your address is in there. Very annoying that over a thousand companies and government departments (on average) have you on file. However, it's trivial to find out where people live, usually, so it's not a very big secret. The most annoying thing to me is the spam they keep mailing you even though you clearly indicated you were not interested in that. Sure, it could be handled a bit more secure than this, but in the end, you are responsible for the amount of personal data you are putting online and you know in advance that once you put it there, certain things are probably going to happen with it. If you only want to deal with companies that will default to sending you GPG encrypted e-mail, you'll not be shopping online a lot for the foreseeable future.\n\nCell phones do pulse usage (single channel voice is 8k\/sec) and only when they are in an actual call. WiFi routers are almost constantly transmitting. If you want to compare phones to wifi, you should either be comparing a PC to a phone, or a cell tower to a wifi router.\n\nSo I make my password 912345 instead of 12345. Big deal. I use the same password as my matching luggage everywhere. I just put the mandatory characters in front of it. That way, I still have to remember a single password and I can read what to put in front of it on the site itself. Highly convenient and extremely secure.... not.\n\nYes, they have. However, it requires client side applications and it is depending on the keyboard you are using. If you have to type your password on a different keyboard, your timing will differ because of the different placement and mechanics of the keyboard. It is only a reliable extra factor if you use a single type of hardware in very similar locations.\n\nAttackers are not trying just one account, but many. They don't try a single account from a single IP sequentially. If you have 1 million accounts and a four digit pin to get in, you get 100 accounts unlocked on average with every sweep of a single pin on those 1 million accounts. Get your botnet to do the sweep, give it a little time so people will log in and reset the counters and in a few months you'd have all the accounts unlocked with almost no lock-outs. You might need a little intelligence put in so you'll delay attempts on accounts that got locked out, not use botnet IPs that got locked out for a week or so if you really want to keep a low profile, but other than that, a 4 digit pin is trivial.\n\nMost of \"lost password\" break-ins are due to the companies demanding you use passwords not storing them properly, giving a hacker a nice database of non or trivially encrypted passwords to use. Password reuse wouldn't be a problem if the password wouldn't be stolen from compromised websites.\n\nImpact kinetic effects are not the same as an explosion. What substances explode on the moon and why didn't that happen when we sent landing crafts over? Could the entire moon explode if a bigger asteroid hits it?"}

(AAP)\n\nTransurban is still investigating a system failure that closed Melbourne's CityLink tunnels but there's no sign computer hacking was to blame.\n\nToll road operator Transurban says it may take some time to determine what caused the computer breakdown that resulted in traffic chaos around Melbourne.\n\nThere was no evidence to suggest computer hacking was behind the technical failure at this stage, Transurban said on Thursday.\n\nCityLink's twin Burnley and Domain tunnels were shut for more than 12 hours from 4.30am (AEST) on Wednesday, resulting in gridlock that encircled the CBD to a radius of 20km.\n\nTransurban chief executive Scott Charlton said the company was still trying to determine what caused the failure of a switch between the safety system and the communication network for the CityLink tunnels.\n\nAsked if it was possible Transurban's computer system was the victim of hacking, Mr Charlton told reporters: \"We have no evidence at this point in time.\n\n\"We don't actually know at this point in time what caused the switch to fail and why the backup system didn't come in.\n\n\"I don't have any more details on what caused the incident.\n\n\"We do have network engineers on site 24\/7 now to ensure that if anything were to develop we could handle the situation immediately.\"\n\nSpeaking after Transurban's annual general meeting on Thursday, Mr Charlton said an analysis of Wednesday's breakdown would take \"as long as it takes\".\n\nHe said Transurban had technicians on duty all the time, but they did not include specialist network staff, so it had taken several hours to isolate the switch failure as the reason for the breakdown.\n\nMr Charlton rejected a rumour Transurban was unable to respond more quickly because it had sacked IT staff capable of dealing with the situation.\n\nTransurban has said it would refund tolls charged from 4am to midnight on Wednesday to compensate motorists for the inconvenience caused by the tunnel closures.\n\nThe AGM heard the refund would cost the company about $1.2 million to $1.3 million in lost revenue.\n\nTransurban chairman Lindsay Maxsted said the company believed that a refund, rather than giving motorists a longer period of free travel, was an appropriate recompense.\n\nMr Maxsted said Transurban had shut the tunnels because the safety risk inherent in allowing a tunnel to remain open with compromised safety systems was too great.\n\nHe said a full closure of the tunnels, used by 120,000 vehicles each weekday, had been the only option.\n\nMr Maxsted said the company was acting to ensure the situation never occurred again.\n\n\"We're confident that the root-cause analysis currently in train will guide the operations team to ensure a similar event is unlikely to ever occur again.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Tony Abbott again used Wednesday's traffic chaos in Melbourne to call for more federal funding for large transport infrastructure projects.\n\nFormer Victorian premier Jeff Kennett said there was always a chance that the technology employed on CityLink could break down, and although the tunnels were closed for safety reasons, some people now felt compelled to squeal about it."}
{"text":"Zero-day (zero-hour or day zero) vulnerabilities are previously unknown vulnerabilities that have not been revealed publicly but are exploited by attackers. Discovering and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities helps cyber criminals to increase the success rate of attacks. Attacks using zero-day exploits are tough to identify and analyze because in many cases information is not available until attacks have already occurred. There is practically no protection against zero-day attacks as details of the vulnerability is usually a mystery when these attacks are first observed.\n\nThe websites of several Swedish government agencies were knocked offline at 2.30pm on Friday afternoon, the time at which hacktivist network Anonymous warned it would launch a cyber attack against Swedish state interests."}
{"text":"This week the SEC released a rather specific set of recommendations asking for six major companies to reveal any large-scale breaches in their cyber-security.\n\nThough the SEC's letter was initially met with some reluctance by Google, Amazon, AIG, HIG, Eastman Chemical Company, and Quest Diagnostics, they all agreed to include any hacking incidents of late in their upcoming 10-Qs. But their acquiescence was not quiet.\n\nBloomberg reported that both Google and Amazon cited possible market risks in disclosing information that they felt had no major impact on their current investors but which could easily scare off future ones.\u00a0They also claimed that disclosure could open up the floodgates for potential investor lawsuits regardless of the well-intentioned transparency brought about by voluntary compliance. Their concerns are not without merit; President Obama has acknowledged their dilemma and is currently considering granting legal protection to companies that not only comply with the SEC preferences but upgrade general security measures in order to prevent future attacks.\n\nThe SEC, for their part, didn't technically issue an official rule ordering the companies to disclose hacking-incidents, but their authority is such that any regulatory \"guidance\" is usually interpreted as regulatory guidelines. \u00a0According to former SEC lawyer, Peter Henning, they can \"make things difficult,\" for dissenters if they are ignored"}
{"text":"What can crackers really do to your PC?\n\nMonday, 27 October 2003, 8:40 AM EST\n\nget a lot of e-mail from readers asking what criminal hackers can and can't do to the average home PC. In most cases, I'd say home systems are fairly safe, if only because each computer is a needle in a giant haystack called the Internet. While the profile of the criminal hacker (for whom I prefer the term \"cracker\") suggests a young male who is both patient and obsessive, most of these individuals would rather stalk the big fish--university, government, and commercial systems--than your computer.\n\nI don't mean to say home PCs aren't targets. They are. Crackers keep track of IP addresses assigned by Internet service providers to dial-up, DSL, and cable-modem users. Some regularly scan those addresses, looking for PCs that are connected to the Net and that have known security vulnerabilities.\n\nThese lists of vulnerable computers are often traded or sold over the Internet, and help virus writers plant their viruses quickly. That's why it's important to use firewall software and keep all your applications updated with the latest patches"}
{"text":"Black ops: how HBGary wrote backdoors for the government\n\nThe attacks last week by Anonymous on security firm HBGary have yanked back \u2026\n\nBack to basics\n\nIn January 2011, Barr had moved on to his research into Anonymous\u2014research that would eventually do his company in. Over at HBGary, Hoglund continued his pursuit of next-gen rootkits. He had hit on a new approach that he called \"Magenta.\"\n\nThis would be a \"new breed of Windows-based rootkit,\" said a Magenta planning document, one that HBGary called a \"multi-context rootkit.\"\n\nThe Magenta software would be written in low-level assembly language, one step up from the ones and zeroes of the binary code with which computers do their calculating. It would inject itself into the Windows kernel, and then inject itself further into an active process; only from there would the main body of the rootkit execute.\n\nMagenta would also inject itself routinely into different processes, jumping around inside the computer's memory to avoid detection. Its command-and-control instructions, telling the rootkit exactly what to do and where to send the information, wouldn't come from some remote Internet server but from the host computer's own memory\u2014where the control instructions had been separately injected.\n\n\"This is ideal because it's trivial to remotely seed C&C messages into any networked Windows host,\" noted Hoglund, \"even if the host in question has full Windows firewalling enabled.\"\n\nNothing like Magenta existed (not publicly, at least), and Hoglund was sure that he could squeeze the rootkit code into less than 4KB of memory and make it \"almost impossible to remove from a live running system.\" Once running, all of the Magenta files on disk could be deleted. Even the best anti-rootkit tools, those that monitored physical memory for signs of such activity, \"would only be of limited use since by the time the responder tried to verify his results Magenta will have already moved to a new location & context.\"\n\nHoglund wanted to build Magenta in two parts: first, a prototype for Windows XP with Service Pack 3\u2014an old operating system but still widely installed. Second, if the prototype generated interest, HBGary could port the rootkit \"to all current flavors of Microsoft Windows.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, Anonymous broke into HBGary Federal's website, cracked Barr's hashed password using rainbow tables, and found themselves in a curious position; Barr was also the administrator for the entire e-mail system, so they were able to grab e-mail from multiple accounts, including Hoglund's.\n\nA world awash in rootkits\n\nThe leaked e-mails provide a tantalizing glimpse of life behind the security curtain. HBGary and HBGary Federal were small players in this space; indeed, HBGary appears to have made much of its cash with more traditional projects, like selling anti-malware defense tools to corporations and scanning their networks for signs of infection.\n\nIf rootkits, paranoia monitors, cartoons, and fake Facebook personas were being proposed and developed here, one can only imagine the sorts of classified projects underway throughout the entire defense and security industry.\n\nWhether these programs are good or bad depends upon how they are used. Just as Hoglund's rootkit expertise meant that he could both detect them and author them, 0-day exploits and rootkits in government hands can be turned to many uses. The FBI has had malware like CIPAV (the Computer and Internet Protocol Address Verifier) for several years, and it's clear from the HBGary e-mail leak that the military is in wide possession of rootkits and other malware of its own. The Stuxnet virus widely believed to have at least damaged Iranian nuclear centrifuge operations is thought to have originated in the US or Israeli governments, for instance.Critics like Glenn Greenwald contend that this nexus of private and public security power is a dangerous mix. \"The real issue highlighted by this episode is just how lawless and unrestrained is the unified axis of government and corporate power,\" he wrote last week.\n\nEspecially (though by no means only) in the worlds of the Surveillance and National Security State, the powers of the state have become largely privatized. There is very little separation between government power and corporate power. Those who wield the latter intrinsically wield the former.\n\nThe revolving door between the highest levels of government and corporate offices rotates so fast and continuously that it has basically flown off its track and no longer provides even the minimal barrier it once did. It's not merely that corporate power is unrestrained; it's worse than that: corporations actively exploit the power of the state to further entrench and enhance their power.\n\nEven if you don't share this view, the e-mails provide a fascinating glimpse into the origins of government-controlled malware. Given the number of rootkits apparently being developed for government use, one wonders just how many machines around the globe could respond to orders from the US military. Or the Chinese military. Or the Russian military.\n\nWhile hackers get most of the attention for their rootkits and botnets and malware, state actors use the same tools to play a different game\u2014the Great Game\u2014and it could be coming soon to a computer near you.\n\nNate Anderson \/ Nate is the deputy editor at Ars Technica, where he oversees long-form feature content and writes about technology law and policy.

{"text":"What are Bugs? Interview with Skipp from Sherlock Investigations\n\nIf you have ever seen a movie or television show involving police, drug busts, espionage, or anything surveillance related, you have probably noticed that a common motif involves a confederate wearing a covert listening device, otherwise known as a bug or a wire, which is used to eavesdrop on criminals. The use of these devices in the real world may or may not be as prevalent as they are portrayed on television and in the movies, but as the rate of technology increases and these devices get less expensive it has become more common to find these devices being used by civilians to illegally eavesdrop on other civilians. The general evolutionary leap forward in technological devices has harbored the way for the application of eavesdropping to no longer be contained solely in the realm of covert listening devices and has grown to include hidden cameras and the monitoring of your web activity.\n\nAn example of a covert way to get a web bug would be Google's Chrome browser where web bugs have become an invasive part of the browser's application store. There are many useful applications, many of which are created by reputable companies or people, but there are also copycat applications made by users for the possible purposes of collecting data about you on the pages you visit \u2013 Everything from banking to email can be accessed.\n\nSherlock Investigation's founder and president, Skipp Porteous, is a Technical Surveillance Counter-Measure (TSCM) specialist trained by the World Institute for Security Enhancement. He has been performing investigative work since the 1960s to include undercover narcotics investigations, collections, and investigative research and reporting.\n\nSkipp wrote Into the Blast: The True Story of D.B. Cooper, with coauthor Robert Blevins, and currently writes frequent articles on his daily experiences in the world of Technical Surveillance Counter-Measures. Skipp was kind enough to have an interview with us on the world of bugs and security:\n\nQ: What is Sherlock Investigations and what are some of the main reasons for seeking the expertise of a Technical Surveillance Countermeasure (TSCM) specialist?\n\nA: Sherlock Investigations, established in 1995, only does electronic bug sweeps, or TSCM (Technical Surveillance Counter-Measures).\n\nPeople can do it themselves, but they usually don't want to. For one thing, they don't have the equipment or knowledge. We have up-to-date, sophisticated, modern equipment. If we do it, you can be sure it's done right.\n\nIn truth though, most \"bugs\" and GPS units (on cars) are found with a physical inspection. You have to know what to look for, and where to look.\n\nQ: In your work, what are some of the most common reasons that people are \"bugged\"?\n\nA: Competition and jealousy. Often, dishonest employees will bug their own company. A competitor might bribe them to do it. Housekeepers, or cleaners, can be bribed, too.\n\nWe had a case with one well-known company in Manhattan that hired a former FBI agent (you have to retire at 55 at the FBI). The company suspected him of tapping all the phone lines, so they fired him. On the day he was fired, they called us. We came that night and found a sophisticated recording device in his former office.\n\nIn another case, we found a GPS underneath a woman's car. Her husband apparently put it there because she was cheating on him. How do we know? Her husband came to the motel where she was cheating.\n\nOn another case, we got a call from a woman who thought her boyfriend was watching her on cameras he'd hidden in her studio apartment. We get calls from paranoid people all the time. She offered to pay me extra to come on a Friday night. Reluctantly, I did it.\n\nWell, I found 3 hidden cameras in her studio apartment. When she went on vacation, her boyfriend, a contractor, said he'd fix up her apartment. He sure did!\n\nQ: How and why do bugs go unnoticed?\n\nA: Most of them are cleverly hidden. And, most people don't expect to be bugged. The most common type of bug today is a simple cell phone. The eavesdropper can call it (it doesn't ring), and listen to the conversation in whatever room it is in. Often, they're hidden in a plant, or under a pile of papers.\n\nYou can buy bugs, including bugging cell phones, on the Internet. They're all made in foreign countries; it's illegal to bug someone in this country.\n\nQ: What are some precautions people can take to make sure their home is secure?\n\nA: Make sure they know everyone who comes into their home. If telephone company or cable company employees come, check their identification, or call the company to see if they belong there.\n\nDo background checks on household employees.\n\nDon't accept electronic gifts, such as clock radios, calculators, or other instruments, especially from people you don't trust.\n\nInformation is one of the most valuable commodities, the proof of which is demonstrated by people's need to acquire more of it even if it means breaking the law. We are very thankful for Skipp to take time out of his busy day to spend some time shedding light on the world of illegal bugs and our security"}
{"text":"Today the subcommittee examines one of the most important subjects - and frankly one of the most complicated subjects - that Congress and the Obama Administration must address in the coming months, and that is cybersecurity. Today hearing is entitled \"Cybersecurity: Preventing Terrorist Attacks and Protecting Privacy in Cyberspace.\"\n\nThe internet was initially designed as a research tool for the sharing of information, and today has grown into one of the most remarkable innovations of the technological and information revolution. The internet has greatly expanded the dissemination of information to individuals across the planet, and has allowed for a greater and more robust exchange of ideas in our new digital global marketplace.\n\nWith these improvements comes many new dangers, however. Today Senators will hear testimony that describes a range of new technological challenges that threaten to undermine cybersecurity and the ability of governments, citizens, and the private sector to safely and securely use the internet. Today we will have a bit of an education for Senators about some new technological terms in cybersecurity, including botnets, targeted and blended phishing, spyware, and malware. Our current system allows criminals, hackers, and terrorists to exploiting the weaknesses of the internet to gain access to confidential and classified information. Such attacks could also manipulate, corrupt, or alter data that is being used to run critical information systems inside the government or private businesses.\n\nSoon after taking office, President Obama ordered a 60-day, comprehensive, \"clean-slate\" review to assess U.S. policies and structures for cybersecurity. The review team of government cybersecurity experts engaged and received input from a broad cross-section of industry, academia, the civil liberties and privacy communities, State governments, international partners, and the Legislative and Executive Branches. In May 2009, the CyberSpace Policy Review (\"Review\") summarized the review team's conclusions and outlined near-term and mid-term action items, for moving toward a reliable, resilient, and trustworthy digital infrastructure for the future.\n\nThis Review contained some sobering conclusions.\n\nThe Review stated that \"the federal government is not organized to address this growing problem effectively now or in the future. Responsibilities for cybersecurity are distributed across a wide array of federal departments and agencies, many with overlapping authorities, and none with sufficient decision authority to direct actions that deal with often conflicting issues in a consistent way.\" The executive summary concludes that \"the nation is at a crossroads...the status quo is no longer acceptable...the national dialogue on cybersecurity must begin today...\"\n\nIt also stated that \"the United States cannot succeed in securing cyberspace if it works in isolation...the Federal government cannot entirely delegate or abrogate its role in secure the Nation from a cyber incident or accident...working with the private sector, performance and security objectives must be defined for the next-generation infrastructure...\"\n\nFinally, the report states that \"the White House must lead the way forward.\"\n\nToday's hearing will therefore examine both governmental and private sector efforts to prevent a terrorist cyberattack, which if successful could cripple large sectors of our government, economy, and essential services. I note that the first recommendation from the Review was to \"appoint a cybersecurity policy official responsible for coordination the Nation's cybersecurity policies and activities.\"\n\nThe hearing will also examine the proper balance between improving cybersecurity and protecting the privacy rights and civil liberties of Americans.\n\nI note that another recommendation from the Review was to \"designate a privacy and civil liberties official to the NSC cybersecurity directorate.\"\n\nFinally, we will examine the proper role of government in setting standards for the private sector or taking control of the internet or computer systems in an emergency.\n\nI look forward to the testimony of our distinguished panel of government witnesses on Panel 1, including the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nI also look forward to the testimony of our distinguished panel of outside witnesses on Panel 2, including the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Internet Security Alliance, and the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\nI will now recognize Senator Kyl, the Ranking Member of our Subcommittee, for any remarks that he would care to make at this time."}

{"text":"I wanted to add one more round to the exchange Eugene and I were having about whether a defendant charged with a federal computer intrusion crime can assert a \"hacking back\" defense. I'm still of the opinion that defendants cannot assert such a defense, and I wanted to respond specifically to Eugene's most recent post about it. Specifically, I want to make two points. First, I'm not entirely sure a general defense of property defense doctrine exists as a default in federal criminal law, and second, if the doctrine exists I don't think it covers computer intrusions.\n\nThe reason I'm unsure that the \"defense of property\" defense exists as a Congressiional default is that the defense seems to be quite rare in federal court, and the cases appear almost entirely in a very specific context. Based on a quick Westlaw check, at least, I could only find about about 30 federal criminal cases that seem to apply it or discuss it at all. Further, those cases arise in almost entirely in a very specific context: a defense raised in a prosecution for physical assault. There's also a bit of homicide and one or other two crimes thrown in, but not much. Perhaps =a lot more cases exist beyond what I could find, but I couldn't find much \u2014 and what I found was quite narrow and applied only on in a very small subset of criminal cases. Clearly this doesn't rule out that Congress legislates all criminal offense against a general background norm of a \"defense of property\" defense being available, but I think it does shed some doubt on it.\n\nSecond, when stated as a defense in federal criminal cases, \"defense of property\" seems to mean only defense of physical property from physical access or removal. For example, in the context of the Model Penal Code's defense of property section, which has been influential in federal court applications of defenses, the provisions are available only \"to prevent or terminate an unlawful entry or other trespass upon land or a trespass against or the unlawful carrying away of tangible, movable property . . . , [or] to effect an entry or re-entry upon land or to retake tangible movable property.\" MPC 3.06. (The MPC seems to treat the kind of interference with property that includes computer intrusions under a separate section, \u00a7 3.10, Justification in Property Crimes, which seems to foillow a different set of principles. Also, while you might think \"entry\" includes virtual entry, entry in the context of criminal trespass statutes are generally understood to mean physical entry.) Given that, it seems that whatever \"defense of property\" doctrine is established as a background norm when Congress creates a new criminal law, it doesn't seem to me to apply to computer attacks.\n\nAnyway, I should stress that we don't yet have any cases on this, so both Eugene and I are guessing as to what courts would or should so based on the legal materials out there. It's a very interesting question. Finally, I'll just add further thoughts in the comment thread in the future, as I'm not sure a lot of readers are interested in this issue."}

{"text":"What People Need to Know about a Malware Attack\n\nA malware attack has swept the nation as internet users whose computers were infected by a malicious virus will be without internet by 12:01 a.m. EDT.\n\nWhat People Need to Know about a Malware Attack\n\nAccording to Fox News, FBI planned to shut down the Internet servers set up as a temporary safety net to keep infected computers online for the past eight months. The court order the agency obtained to keep the servers running expired, and it was not renewed. The malware attack occurred when international hackers ran an online advertising scam to take control of more than 570,000 infected computers around the world. When the FBI apprehended the hackers and their servers, they realized that if they shut the servers down, tens of thousands would be without internet.\n\nThe FBI decided to set up a safety net, where The bureau brought in a private company to install two clean Internet servers to take over for the malicious servers so that people would not suddenly lose their Internet. The FBI then hired a private company to run a website  as a place where computer users could go to see if their computer was infected and find links to other computer security business sites where they could find fixes for the problem.\n\nWhile the FBI efforts with the situation have been commendable, many conspiracy theories have surfaced questioning the government's motive for the servers supplying internet to thousands, speculating that they are watching what the internet users are doing and invading their privacy. One computer user commented, \"I think the FBI just wants everyone to go to that website to check our computers so they can check our computers as well. Just a way to steal data for their own research.\"\n\nRep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., and co-founder of Congress' cybersecurity caucus, said its the computer user's responsibility to be up to date with all the information and to take care of their product that holds a bountiful of their information, \"These types of issues are only going to increase as our society relies more and more on the Internet, so it is a reminder that everyone can do their part.\"\n\nCurrently, the FBI is tracking how many computers are still infected with this malware, and the numbers are still staggering. According to the FBI's latest count on Wednesday, there were about 45,600 in the U.S. and roughly 250,000 worldwide infected computers."}

{"text":"A virus is locking down computers and demanding hundreds of dollars while accusing the victims of internet crimes. The message says it is from the FBI. Some people are paying the ransom to have their computers unlocked.\n\nIt happened to Tish Pack's computer at their home in Monroe. A screen popped up, announcing it was from the FBI and accusing the family of illegal computer activity. It also turned on their web cam.\n\n\"That was creepy and a little unsettling and he actually put tape over the camera,\" said Pack.\n\nThe virus is called the Reveton Ransomware. Ransom because the crooks that locked down Tish Pack's computer wanted $200 in prepaid money cards to unlock it. They said it was a fine.\n\n\"I worry about people because you hear about scams all the time. I think of older people...who trust everybody in the world and they just go with it,\"said Pack.\n\n\"We are trying to get the information out that the FBI just doesn't do business this way,\" said FBI Special Agent Stephen Emmett.\n\nThe FBI is on the case and not happy that agency's name is being used that way.\n\n\"You're not going to get a message popping up on your computer telling you that illegal activity is being discovered on your computer and to pay us a fine. We do not operate that way,\" said Emmett.\n\nThe FBI says the fix for victim's computers is complex. They suggest doing what Tish Pack did: take the computer to an expert.\n\n\"Don't send them any money, don't give them any credit card number and do not give them your credit card number,\" said Lee Faile of Cyber Buddy in Conyers.\n\nFaile says he has repaired eight computers with the ransomware in just the last few weeks. He said that up-to-date anti-virus software can help.\n\nThe longer Reveton stays on your computer, the more damage the virus does, Faile said. And even if you unfreeze the computer, the FBI says the malware still lingers in the background, gathering personal information, such as passwords and credit card information.\n\nTish and her husband did everything right. They immediately turned the computer off.\n\n\"You are going to be less likely to lose data. And it's going to be easier for your technician to clean it up,\" said Faile.\n\nSo remember, turn off your computer immediately and take it to an expert. Finally, don't give them any money. Take away the profit, and this virus goes away"}
{"text":"The level of cybersecurity in the U.K. is so shallow it presents clear risk to national security -- and could take as long as 20 years to fix. That's the warning from a new study by the U.K. national spending watchdog The National Audit Office (NAO).\n\nThreats to cybersecurity are both \"persistent\" and \"continually evolving,\" says the study, with the annual cost of cyber crime to the U.K. currently estimated to be between \u00a327 billion and \u00a342 billion ($18 billion and $28 billion). As a result, \"Business, government and the public must therefore be constantly alert to the level of risk if they are to succeed in detecting and resisting the threat of cyber attack.\" One report quoted in the study said the U.K. suffered 44 million cyber attacks in 2011 alone.\n\nReports\n\nThe report praised the government's decision two years ago to commit an extra \u00a3650 million ($1.01 billion) to beef up cyber defenses, with the money going mainly to the military and security agencies. However, that might only be the start of a longer journey to fuller security. The extra funding is scheduled to run out in 2015. To put the amount spent on security into context, the study says the U.K.'s Internet economy is over \u00a3120 billion ($187 billion).\n\nThe money is part of an initiative called the U.K.'s Cyber Security Strategy, which has detailed the risks of the U.K.'s growing reliance on cyberspace and lists a group as diverse as criminals, terrorists, foreign intelligence services, foreign militaries and politically motivated \"hacktivists\" as potential enemies who might choose to attack the nation via the Web or other electronic means.\n\nSo far the money has been put to effective use, says the study, citing the creation of the U.K. equivalent to the FBI, the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA), which has clawed back more than 2.3 million items of compromised financial account holder card payment details in the U.K. and internationally since 2011. This prevented potential economic loss of over \u00a3500 million ($778 million). In the last 12 months alone the British public has come forward to report over 46,000 reports of cyber crime, amounting to \u00a3292 million ($455 million) in attempted fraud, it said.\n\nThe challenge, say the report's authors, is the next stage -- of where the country needs to commit resources going forward. It identifies six action items that need funding: encourage the computer industry to protect and promote itself and U.K. companies; address the nation's current and future ICT and cybersecurity skills gap; increase awareness so that people are not the weakest link; tackle cyber crime and enforce the law; get government to be more agile and joined-up; and demonstrate value for money.\n\nBut a bigger issue that could hobble the entire program is lack of homegrown IT security nous. The number of IT and cybersecurity professionals in the U.K. has not increased in line with the growth of the Internet, the report states, quoting experts that it could take \"up to 20 years to address the skills gap.\" Interestingly, that doesn't mean just more Brit white hat hackers; a number of skills need to be amplified, it believes. \"The skills the U.K. needs to design and implement cybersecurity policy are not only technical, there is also a need for psychologists; law enforcers; corporate strategists and risk managers. Other professionals such as lawyers and accountants also need to understand cybersecurity in order to assess, manage and mitigate the business risk of cyber threats,\" says the study.\n\nIt also might mean some education at the consumer level. The study says up to 21% of U.K. Internet users do not think they have sufficient skills to protect their personal data, although the country's semi-secret communications defense body, GCHQ, has estimated that 80% of cyber attacks could be prevented through simple computer and network \"hygiene,\" such as using strong passwords. Unfortunately, in 2012 the top three passwords in the U.K. were \"password,\" \"123456\" and \"12345678.\""}

{"text":"Cyber Warfare: The New Threat\n\nThe cyber warriors will identify own networks weakness which will be followed up by regular patch up of vulnerabilities. In addition their actual target could include blowing up electric generators \/ motors; use of high power microwave to upset fly by control of combat aircraft and more.\n\nSome contemporary thinkers have equated Cyber-Warfare as another new form of warfare which is on par with Land, Naval and Air Warfare. This is partly reflected in USA creating a new Cyber Command headed by a General, who is also the boss of Central Security Services and Director of National Security Agency. In the 2010 strategic review of security and defense in UK, while many major defense programmes have been cut and overall defense budget is reduced by eight percent, Cyber War has been allotted \u00a3 650 m for the period 2010-14. A significant increase indeed!\n\nCyber War has become a major subset of warfare now, because the militaries and their equipments rely on many systems, each of which has computers, often many computers in each system.\n\nWhile Cyber War seems a very familiar term to everyone, it will be useful to revisit its characteristics which make it so important and so different from other forms of warfare. It is distinctly different from the traditional warfare wherein armies, navies and air forces are massed against each other to fight one another.\n\nCyber War can be fought by anyone; even an individual using his hacking skills against huge corporations, nations or even different civilizations. One single person's malicious software can wreck havoc on computer networks and programmes spread across nations and continents. The modem world's industry, economy, institutions and even other facets of life is supported by computers and associated software. So all these facets of life can be disrupted for prolonged period by cyber attacks. The individual could be -acting alone; he could be part of a group pursuing its inimical agenda or could be state supported, working to further the plans of the state. The defender cannot distinguish between them or pinpoint the full identity of the attacker or the actual source of attack. So while the cyber enemy may be guessed, definite, pinpointing is nearly impossible.\n\nAmongst various types of warfare, cyber war is the cheapest option. At its simplest, all it requires is one individual, on one computer to originate cyber attacks. There is no need for regular massive cyber armies equipped with all the paraphernalia of a conventional war; being trained, sustained and replenished regularly. Unlike in conventional war, where the attacker generally suffers heavy casualties, in Cyber War there is no casualty to the attacker. In this war, it is not the physical might of a soldier, the quality and quantity of equipment, the integration and orchestration of systems, or the strategic genius of a General which is tested. It is only the computer genius and skills \u2013 and these too come as easily to gifted teens as to the experts after years of serious study and perseverance. Therefore, each and everyone cannot be a cyber warrior. Conscription cannot create a Cyber Army \u2014 it is by recruiting suitable people with aptitude for such work. In cyber force, there is not much place for officer \u2013 soldier hierarchy. Rather it is a team of the like-minded\n\nWhen one's computer system does not work, it is not easy to distinguish whether the failure is a genuine malfunction or a result of malicious attack. More often than not one tends to believe that his computer system itself is malfunctioning. So it is difficult to determine if one is under cyber attack. The nature of attacks are such, for example hidden Trojans activated on command or at pre-determined time, that one does not know when the actual attack was launched.\n\nThe origins of attack also remain uncertain. The attacking nation or non-state actor can route his attack via a computers located in a third country or even through benign computers based in the country being attacked. These could be the personal computers of citizens of the country under attack. Such an approach poses major dilemma for defender and for the right to computer privacy in democratic societies Its algorithm can be programmed in variety of ways to defeat most defenses.\n\nThe defender in cyber world has to cope with many problems. The existing defenses are against only known viruses\/worms. Defense networks, therefore, require constant upgradation. Even secure nets can be injected with virus even though attacker is not physically connected into the net. But then excessive security on the net decrease the system speed.\n\nDetailed information on cyber war in various countries is difficult to find. However, certain amount of information is available about development of cyber war organisation in USA in the open literature. Hence it is proposed to study the evolution of cyber war organisation in USA.\n\nUSA\n\nIn earnest Electronic Warfare (EW) started during World War II. It matured as the radars and radar guided SAMs and anti-ac artillery evolved through the Vietnam war; the wars in the Middle East etc, Till recently EW meant brute jamming of signals or breaking the electronic lock on an aircraft by moving the lock away spatially. In the Op Desert Storm of Gulf War 91, false target information was injected into Iraqi Integrated Air Defence System, thereby misleading its computers. This can be considered the start of Cyber War in military domain. The Cyber War in the civil domain by way of unethical hacking into banking networks started little earlier.\n\nIW operations were undertaken during Bosnia Operation in 1995 and against Serbia in 1999. The comprehensive operations included EW against Radars and SAMs, cyber attacks against IADS, operations against Television, Radio as well as cyber attacks against computer based systems like power generation, Oil refining systems\u2026\n\nSo now there are three terms : EW, Cyber War and Information War often loosely used to convey the same thing. Electronic War is said to take place when electrons in a system are disturbed. Cyber space is also the space where electrons flow conveying information. But cyber space is normally referred to space in which computer electrons move around \u2013 either within the computer itself or between many computers connected in a network. The network itself could be a cable or fiber optic network or a wireless net in which electronic signals move between a transmitter and a receiver \u2014 the most apt example being a satellite and its terminals. Thus, in the militaries too, initially terms like EW, IW and Cyber War were used loosely and interchangeably.\n\nCyber War has become a major subset of warfare now, because the militaries and their equipments rely on many systems, each of which has computers, often many computers in each system. At the same time all facets of civil life, industry, banking and financial service power generation etc have also been based on extensive computer networks and infinite number of software lines. In such a huge complex of electrons, EW as practiced till 1980s, forms a small subset. Altering cyber electrons means altering information-hence the term IW. However, in current US terminologies IW means irregular warfare. Cyber War includes the earlier EW and IW.\n\nRepresentative products: Fu series multi-resistant fasteners.

{"text":"Beyond Viruses\n\nThe cost to U.S. companies of doing battle with network attacks has fallen significantly. That was a piece of excellent news from the tenth annual CSI\/FBI Computer Crime and Security Survey for 2005, which gathered survey data from 700 information-security professionals at businesses and government organizations. Not all the news is rosy, though. Losses from the theft of proprietary information\u2014especially as hackers pursue databases full of online identities\u2014rose dramatically last year.\n\nRespondents reported that network attacks cost them $203,606 in 2004 on average, down from $526,010 in 2003\u2014a 61 percent decline, thanks in part to better antivirus technology and more awareness. \"Viruses are still a big-ticket item,\" says Robert Richardson, a director of the Computer Security Institute, \"but theft of proprietary information is growing fast. I think it's indicative of a shift in cybercrime toward consumers.\"\n\nThe fastest-growing computer-security threat to organizations is Web site defacement, according to the study. A whopping 95 percent of respondents reported more than ten Web site incidents in the past year, compared with only 5 percent a year ago.\n\nWhile virus attacks are hurting companies less, the CSI\/FBI survey did put some numbers on the damage from electronic theft of proprietary information. It cost the average firm $355,552\u2014up from $168,529 a year ago. That'll take a bite out of a company's virus-fighting savings"}
{"text":"Spam messages offering links to a tool designed to knock out the website of President Obama lead only to dodgy software.\n\nJunk mail ostensibly punting software that allows anti-Obama-ists to become cyberactivists says: \"If You don't like Obama come here, you can help to ddos his site with your installs.\" Disappointingly, no deeper political reason why a DDoS attack might be justified is offered.\n\nThe terse spam message links to a website where prospective marks are offered money for installing the dodgy \"packet flinging\" tool. The attackers missed a chance to make reference to a recent mass marketing campaign from the White House justifying recent healthcare reforms that some have described as spam as supposedly justifying an \"aggressive response\", for example.\n\nVisitors to the ropey site punted by the spam are told to come back regularly for updates and warned that security scanner software may come to identify the software on offer as malign, and consign it to quarantine.\n\nThat's certainly true, though not for the reasons suggested.\n\nThe \"DDoS Obama\" spam was one theme of a larger spam run, reports email security firm Proofpoint. Other spam messages in the series offered more typical lures, such as pornography, while again pointing to the same malware download.\n\nAs Proofpoint helpfully explains, users would be foolhardy to take the description offered by hackers at face value. Leaving aside ethical concerns and potential for prosecution, it's always more likely that any supposed Obama website attack tool would turn compromised machines into spam-relaying zombies than anything else.\n\n\"Regardless of your political leanings - installing such software is a really bad idea,\" Proofpoint concludes.\n\nProofpoint's point is valid, although it's worth pointing out there is a precedent for DDoS attack tools that volunteers were invited to install. Zionist cyberactivists were offered a tool that did actually throw malign packets at Hamas websites earlier this year, though the same approach might just have easily been used to distribute banking Trojans or spambots, for example. \u00ae\n\n\"Fake\" grass roots?\n\nThat's the new mantra. Bush and Cheney are gone, no other nameable target available, so claim the people themselves are phony. It isn't like President \"community organizer\" Obama and his Chicago posse have ever organized a protest. Everything their supporters do is spontaneous and from the heart.\n\nBottom line is that Democratic party congressmen with slim majorities know perfectly well that the protesters represent real voters, and they are very worried about it. Organized protests are what political parties do between elections. At elections they organize the turnout. All parties, all countries. The Democrats control both houses of congress, and they can pass anything they can get all the Democrats to agree on. Obama will sign it. Their problem is that they can't get all their own party onside.

{"text":"December 14, 2007\n\nChinese Hackers\n\nBut reports in Chinese newspapers suggest that the establishment of a cybermilitia is well under way. In recent years, for example, the military has engaged in nationwide recruiting campaigns to try to discover the nation's most talented hackers. The campaigns are conducted through competitions that feature large cash prizes, with the PLA advertising the challenges in local newspapers.\n\nTan is a successful graduate of this system. He earned $4,000 in prize money from hacker competitions, enough to make him worthy of a glowing profile in Sichuan University's campus newspaper. Tan told the paper that he was at his happiest \"when he succeeds in gaining control of a server\" and described a highly organized selection and training process that aspiring cybermilitiamen (no cyberwomen, apparently) undertake. The story details the links between the hackers and the military. \"On July 25, 2005,\" it said, \".\" (The State Council Information Office didn't respond to questions about Tan, and China's Foreign Ministry denies knowing about him.)\n\nWith the help of experts from Sichuan University, the story continued, Tan's team won the competition and then had a month of intense training organized by the provincial military command, simulating attacks, designing hacking tools and drafting network-infiltration strategies. Tan was then chosen to represent the Sichuan Military Command in competition with other provinces. His team won again, after which, the iDefense reports say, he founded the NCPH and acquired an unidentified benefactor (\"most likely the PLA\") to subsidize the group's activities to the tune of $271 a month.\n\nIt is more than a little ironic, is it not, that in providing not some imaginary hobgoblin but a real and credible third party threat - a threat that we have no option but to counter and thus which forces us to distribute widely the necessary defensive training and tools - it is the government of totalitarian China that offers the best hope for the defence of liberty from our own governments.\n\nThough, I'd be shocked if, when the real story comes out, we don't learn that the Chinese had to develop this capability to defend themselves against the US NSA and other \"black\" organizations within the US Military...\n\n\"O.K., so what does the NCPH, which Tan founded in 2004 when he was a student at Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, actually do? The answer starts out vague, but eventually pride gets the better of the young men. They acknowledge that the group first got its reputation by hacking 40% of the hacker associations' websites in China. That was during their \"young and hotheaded college days,\" as Fisherman puts it. The NCPH is also famous for the remote-network-control programs they wrote and offered for download.\"\n\nFrom p.2 of the article:\n\n\"'On July 25, 2005,' it said, '.'\"\n\nIf we believe this, does this indicate that Tan may be partially motivated by a compromise factor?\n\nOn the flip-side - In the USA we have stories of kids with these skills charged with crimes - just for 'looking'. Using someone else's wi-fi can land you in hot water, and this type of skill-set and behavior is seen as a threat and discouraged...\n\nThis is almost certainly a mistranslation and Time's snideness is unwarranted.\n\nIn this context a Chinese would say \"cybermilitiapersons\" or use the word for militia which, like ours, does not indicate gender.\n\nThe Chinese usually use the gender-neutral equivalent of \"person\" (\"ren\" in Pinyin) rather than the gender-specific words (\"nan\" man OR \"nu\" woman). Whereas in English \"man\" could mean either \"person\" or \"male person.\"\n\nOddly, America, with the strongest military in the world, doesn't seem to have an elite team of hackers maybe it should learn something for the Chinese.\n\nThe Islamic terrorist movement has a steady stream of recruits coming from websites around the the world. If our war on terror were truly managed right, the US would aim its sites at these highly effective propaganda war machines.\n\nI am not advocating censorship (or the war) here, I am just saying that if the US were fighting it right, (which maybe i would have supported years ago, before it became World War III), they would simply take out these sites. Simple DOS attacks would probably be enough to take down a large portion of the terrorist information machine.\n\n@John ~ Good for China? I'd be pleased to find out that you're not living in the US. The atrocities from the Chinese outnumber and outdo anything the US has done. How dare you? I hope you wake up some day.\n\n\"America, with the strongest military in the world, doesn't seem to have an elite team of hackers maybe it should learn something for the Chinese.\"\n\nI don't believe that. We're certainly not as public with our military hackers as China is, but I can't imagine that the U.S. military isn't building up a sizable cyberwar capability -- both offensive and defensive.\n\nCouple x-ref's come to mind. In the Bruce-suggested Malcolm Gladwell's \"Blink\" there's the story of a military scenario which was re-done to make it appear the guys with all the big toys \"won\". But take it a step further, Zinn's book \"A People's History of the United States\". Here it shown time and again that the US is going to keep the upper hand, at whatever costs.\n\n\"I don't believe that. We're certainly not as public with our military hackers as China is, but I can't imagine that the U.S. military isn't building up a sizable cyberwar capability -- both offensive and defensive.\"\n\nI have my doubts. Due to China's blend of totalitarian control over it's society mixed with free market finance, it is able to use capitalist techniques like cash prize competitions, combined with powerful nationalism, to develop best of breed hacker schools. I suspect it's difficult to get the kind of experience the best Chinese hacker have without risk of prosecution by American or European law enforcement agencies. China can deny allegations of cyberspace attacks because the Chinese government keeps a very tight grip on the country's political organs. American hackers attempting the same against China would quickly be outed by parties with different agendas in their own country. Undoubtedly there are good cyberspace warriors in the American army but are they the best?\n\n@ Sceptic\n\"Due to China's blend of totalitarian control over it's society mixed with free market finance, it is able to use capitalist techniques like cash prize competitions, combined with powerful nationalism, to develop best of breed hacker schools.\"\n\nNot to mention the vast difference in population size, a preference for male babies that has lead to some 30m or so extra young males, a higher mean IQ, and more limited alternative options, all of which, were they to be tapped effectively, would mean far more elite hackers than the US can muster.\n\n\"I suspect it's difficult to get the kind of experience the best Chinese hacker have without risk of prosecution by American or European law enforcement agencies.\"\nIndeed, to which I refer the honourable gentleman to the comment I made some hours ago.\n\nI'd really *like* to believe that the U.S. government has a secret stable of top hackers, in some nondescript office building somewhere, but I really don't think so.\n\nIf you had to pick a single word to sum up the government, it's \"mediocre.\" The only areas where the government or government agencies are the best are where they're the *only* ones doing the job. In those cases they're the best by default -- and that means they don't have to compete with the private sector for brainpower.\n\nBut look at any government agency which has a twin in the private sector and the government operation will almost inevitably be a paragon of ineptitude and waste, staffed by second-raters and time-servers.\n\nSo while there may be agencies claiming to be involved in \"cyberwar,\" I see no reason to assume that any of them are the mysterious ultra-secret\/badass bunch of hackers that some people seem to believe in. If such a division existed, it would probably be over budget, behind schedule, and 10 years out of date: just like the rest of the government.\n\nBeing a US citizen, I would like to believe that the US has a powerful defensive \"cybermilitary,\" but my original question still stands, why haven't they taken out all the terrorist websites?\n\nAlso, being a resident of China (working at a Singaporean IT Security Company in Beijing) I would like to respond to Fred: Living outside the US is both a blessing and a curse. People here are and feel much safer then in America. There is no war propaganda, no constant fear of search, if not seizure, and the police presence is much lower here.... as long as you don't raise your voice.\n\n@Fred: \"Atrocities\" is great sensationalism, bravo for taking the high road in your reply. All I know is that the US was never brought to task for the Indian \/ Philippine campaigns, not to mention the the support America used to provide to several rather nasty regimes. We're not done with the \"War Against Terror\" and we don't have transparency as to how we're treating \"terrorists\", so I wouldn't get too high on that horse just yet...\n\nBut China will not keep any gains to the point required to harm anyone. China largely has no philosophy apart from that of personal gain. The government is corrupt, as are all governments. But without a uniting philosophy, all individuals will work toward their best interests, with no trust for authority, government, employer, etc.\n\nThe world's only fear of China is that they collectively find a cause to unite them.\n\nBefore you discount what I have said, take ten minutes and Google \"China\" on Google news...\n\nTaking out a \"terrorist\" site that is hosted in another country would likely be seen as an act of war. So, if that country isn't currently part of one of the US's ongoing wars, would it really be worth starting *another* war to take down a site that would just be up and running again within hours anyway? That's called \"whack-a-mole\". A more valuable approach: infiltrate and observe.\n\nChinese Military Hackers Attack Foreign Government Computers?\nBy Xu Wu\n\nXu Wu is assistant professor of strategic media and public relations at Arizona State University and author of Chinese Cyber Nationalism: Evolution, Characteristics, and Implications.\n\nFirst Germany, then United States, then France, then Australia. One after another, countries join the chorus accusing that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) was behind the recent malicious attempts to hack into foreign governments' computer systems. Although by no means bullet-proof, most of the reports, or at least their normally anonymous sources, hinted two \"facts\ufffd\ufffd?: first, these hacking activities were carried out by Chinese military or its affiliated agencies; second, the Chinese government, or more specifically, some top-level officials, knew about and support these operations. Although not a computer expert, I found both the premises, and the logic, not to mention the conclusion, are problematic.\n\nSuppose, (1) that these hacking activities did occur as accused\u2014let's ignore the suspicious two- to three-month time lag between the crime and the disclosure; (2) that this kind of online activities is universally rejected, forbidden, loathed, and demeaned, and no civilized country on the earth will engage in this type of low-class, immoral information-gathering intrusions; (3) that these attempts did originate physically from China\u2014(let us just pretend the above conditions are all met, for the sake of discussions)\u2014I still could not figure out how they pinpointed China's military as the guilty party and blamed the Chinese government for the wrongdoing.\n\nHere are my reasons, from the technologically amateurish to the politically incorrect.\n\nFirst, every morning while sitting before my office computer and checking my online inbox, I have to delete those admirably persistent spam e-mails, normally with a weird name and address. The online administrator at my institution has promised and updated many times the filtering software, but, on average, I still receive more trash e-mails than the useful ones. If the spam spreaders can somehow find a way to evade the cat-and-mouse cyber chase and hide their identities, I don't know why the \"quasi-formidable\ufffd\ufffd? Chinese military cyber geeks can not hide. If they are technologically savvy enough to break into some of the most sophisticated computer systems in the world, shouldn't they know how to use proxy software and other hacking tools to erase the trace?\n\nSecond, even if the perpetrators are indeed Chinese citizens living inside China (Guangzhou and Lanzhou, to be more specific), how can the accusers identify with certainty that those perpetrators were PLA agents, operating with the support of the government? Why couldn't they be a small group of technologically savvy \"cyber nationalists\ufffd\ufffd? who initiated these rampant and bald moves? Let us not forget, there are over 140 million online users in China, half of them using broadband fast-speed Internet surfing online. If you still think this scenario is unlikely, take a look at several \"historical\ufffd\ufffd? events occurred not so long ago. In May 1999, when the news broke that Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was bombed by a U.S. B-2 stealth bomber, a group of self-organized Chinese hackers defaced the website of the U.S. Embassy in China within 12 hours, and knocked out of service the White House's official website, the first time in its history. Two years later, when diplomats from China and United States were busy tangling on the most appropriate way to say \"sorry\ufffd\ufffd? over the spy-plane collision incident, an estimated number of 80,000 Chinese hackers participated in the so-called \"Red May Self-Defense Cyber Warfare,\ufffd\ufffd? fighting with an unknown number of American hackers. Several thousands of business, educational, governmental, even military websites on both sides fell prey to this unprecedented massive cyber-nationalistic anger. In a summary report, New York Times reporter even named this online conflict the \"World Wide Web War I.\ufffd\ufffd?\n\nIt has become a thinking pattern among many Western observers that anything happened in China was the result of Chinese government's or PLA's calculated maneuver. Even this assumption seems reasonable twenty years ago, it is fairly outdated nowadays, given the breathtaking development and diversification in China's economic, societal, cultural, and even political decision-making sectors. A couple of months ago, two Chinese young scholars in different occasions voiced their personal opinions on China's huge foreign reserve. Because their position was different from the official line, a rain of protests, accusations, warnings, demands were filed in front of Chinese government's doorsteps. If an American economist can have his or her different view on financial policy, why can't a Chinese scholar? If opposing China's political policy belongs to the \"freedom of speech,\ufffd\ufffd? why opposing China's monetary policy becomes a \"foolhardy\ufffd\ufffd? troublemaker?\n\nAn interesting analogy can also be made between these online hacking incidents and the ongoing safety issues involving the \"made-in-China\ufffd\ufffd? products. Yes, those defective products were made in China, but they were not made by the \"Chinese government.\ufffd\ufffd? Although the government shares the burden of enforcing high-quality regulations, it is those tens of thousands of manufacturers or even those American importers who should be blamed for the lack of quality control and inspection. Also, although the label says \"made-in-China,\ufffd\ufffd? it is, to a large extent, only assembled in China. In other words, just like those evasive online hackers, unless you catch them blood in hands, who knows where they are from, who they are, and what they are doing for?\n\nCurrently there are plenty notifications of Chinese cyber attacks in the Web. But all the messages are dispersed and not coherent with the fact that there are the same IP addresses from which cyber-tentacles are protruding up to ports 1026-1027 of thousands computers worldwide nowadays.\nSome incomprehensible menace is radiated from the city of Qiqihar (Heilongjiang Province). It has been detected by the IP Information service of  through verifying addresses 221.208.208.92, 221.208.208.94, 221.208.208.100 etc.\nThe menace is incomprehensible because of the addresses belonging to the CNCGC (large-scale Chinese telecommunication corporation especially established to serve the forthcoming Olympic Games in China) and because of its silence in response to the requests to stop the hack attacks. So, the last ones are continued.\nWhat's going on? We have to take into account that Chinese hackers cracked a Pentagon computer system; France and England also had China-caused cybernetic losses and declared the official protests. But China responded apart with own pronounced intention to conquer the world-wide cyberspace by 2050 year.\nSo far a pool of Chinese powerful computers bluntly executes the penetration probe on thousands and thousands computers which are ordinary, not loaded with any top secret information, beating these swoops with their firewalls for the time present off \u2026\nIt may be surmised that the Chinese persistently develop and test their hardware and\/or software innovations in order to suppress the Web communications on the day \"X\ufffd\ufffd?."}
{"text":"Skype said Tuesday it is investigating a new tool that collects a person's last known IP address, a potential privacy-compromising issue.\n\nInstructions posted on Pastebin on Thursday showed how a person's IP address could be shown without adding the targeted user as a contact by looking at the person's general information and log files:  Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, said in an e-mail statement that:\"this is an ongoing, industry-wide issue faced by all peer-to-peer software companies. We are committed to the safety and security of our customers and we are taking measures to help protect them.\"\n\nIn October, Skype acknowledged a research paper that showed how a Skype user's IP address can be determined without that user knowing:  It also demonstrated that more than half the time the IP address could be accurately linked to sharing content using the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol.\n\nAn IP address is an important piece of information that can be used to track the approximate location of a user and their service provider. But the information is not necessarily accurate, as a person could be using a VPN, whose data center may be located in a different country than the actual user.\n\nAnother way to broadcast inaccurate IP addresses is browsing the internet using The Onion Router (TOR):  , an anonymizing service that routes a person's internet traffic through a network of worldwide servers in a fashion that is difficult to trace.

{"text":"Anonymous attacking Sony?\n\nWhat we heard: Internet hacktivism has in large part been led in recent years by the loose collective known as Anonymous. The group has taken up the causes of a variety of free speech and Internet freedom advocates, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and US military whistle-blower Bradley Manning, using means that include distributed denial of service attacks to take retribution on perceived oppressors.\n\n\"Congratulations! You are now receiving the attention of Anonymous,\" the declaration reads. \"Your recent legal actions against fellow internet citizens, GeoHot and Graf_Chokolo have been deemed an unforgivable offense against free speech and internet freedom, primary sources of free lulz (and you know how we feel about lulz.)\"\n\n\"You have abused the judicial system in an attempt to censor information about how your products work,\" the message continued. \"You have victimized your own customers merely for possessing and sharing information, and continue to target those who seek this information. In doing so you have violated the privacy of thousands of innocent people who only sought the free distribution of information\n\nThe manifesto of sorts concludes by saying that the group will attack Sony's private domains. And, perhaps coincidentally enough, Sony appears to be suffering some stability issues today through the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network.\n\nGameSpot has found that the PSN is experiencing intermittent service and general lag while performing a variety of activities, including browsing and downloading through the PlayStation Store, receiving updates, and using the console's Internet browser. GameSpot has also encountered a variety of error messages, including, \"An error has occurred during the installation operation (80710B23).\"\n\nBeyond the possible DDoS attack, Anonymous is attempting to organize a sit-in of sorts at SonyStyle stores. According to the group's Facebook page, the public action is being planned for April 16-17.\n\nThe official story: It is unclear whether the PSN's intermittent connectivity is a result of an Internet attack or general maintenance. In a post to its Twitter feed, the PS3 maker said, \"PSN currently undergoing sporadic maintenance. Access to the PSN may be interrupted throughout the day. We apologize for any inconvenience.\"\n\nFurther, the publisher does not appear to be experiencing any issues with PlayStation.com or the PlayStation Blog. Sony had not responded to a request for comment on the alleged Anonymous attack as of press time.\n\nBogus or not bogus?: As yet unclear. Sony is clearly suffering a bout of instability on the PSN side, but it remains to be seen whether this is due to a DDoS attack or to routine maintenanceJapanese have a hard time with English, this is why the Sony had difficulty in dealing with them.

There's your target. tyvm.\n\n@Snicsnipe, I am not your buddy, you can do what you want to your console behind doors, but once you come out and play with the masses, you are open to whatever Sony wishes to do. I give a hoot on what you do behind closed doors but when you come from behind them that is when I care. If you feel you can do what you want to do, come from behind that closed door that is if you are not scared. Yes, the console is yours but it is not to do what you want and when you purchased that console you are bound to the rules that company set forth and the courts will back the company as shown.

Seriously though lol They can hack and hate corporations that earn money ect all they want...but at the end of the day, we all go outside, have wives and girlfriends. Happy days\n\nSony needs to make an example outta these hackers. Sony does what they do cause they're a multi-billion company they can sue these spoiled college hackers and they're moms and dads won't bail 'em out cause hacking is WRONG. Hacking can put you in prison for a while. Sony shouldn't have let GeoHotz walk free and they shouldn't let these hackers walk free, put they're candy a$$es in prison.\n\n@Jelley0 You redirected the point of the comment. I paid money to enjoy a system. Forget weather or not i truly own it, the idea is people hacking the system ruins what i wish to enjoy. If you want a system that acts like a PC buy a PC.\n\n@mardinn Insulting wasn't my attempt, as you can see from the \"no offence\" part. I just simply believe that a company with multiple people have thought this same thing through before any of us here. They have more brains in the company than a singular person here anyway.\n\n@Vengeful_Angel based on technology! if you haven't noticed discs are becoming obsolete in favor of hard drives!!! Streaming is top notch and can be streamed in HD Hard drives are becoming much cheaper because of the rise of Solid State drive tech! So what that means is Why pay hundreds of dollars for a console when all you need to do is download your games! Hence OnLive!\n\n@TevoxZi Lets not insult, this is just a conversation. I did not know that he said that he would allow 3rd party softwares through OtherOS. Oh well.. Then we will just have to see what will happen, and like you said it is highly unlikely that Sony will put OtherOS back..\n\nRidiculous, it is stupid that they get caught for breaking the root key, it is their console, not sony's. They BOUGHT the console so it is to them to use them as they want. Breaking the rootkey DOES NOT MEAN using it for ILLEGAL games. But then hacking sony and mess stuff up for gamers is just childish...\n\n@mardinn Too bad GeoHotz made claims he would allow 3rd party softwares through Other OS, which is why it was removed in the first place. The removal of the Other OS, lead to hacking, but homebrew would've come either way, which would've lead to piracy. Obviously Sony is not going to put it back. Don't take this personally, but I do believe a group of people has more brains than you.\n\nWhile some of you may think Geohotz's rights are being violated, Sony and PS3 gamers have rights as well. Geohotz has opened the door for hackers and these hackers are ruining the fun for everyone else. It all starts with this man. He is why hackers have made a breakthrough on PS3. This will piss people off and Sony will lose customers and affect their business. No company in the world would just sit there and let that happen.Sony are just standing up and protecting their business. And PS3 gamers also have the right to enjoy what they have paid for.. Not how hackers enjoy it. No one likes their fun being ruined. So I'm with Sony all the way here.\n\nBoy I just love when these heroic hackers take matters into their own hands. I get the whole free speech thing, and not wanting to spend all that money on games, and wanting to do whatever you want with your console but for crying out loud don't ruin our experience. As far as I'm concerned hackers can jog off because I pay my hard earned cash to play just like many other PS3 users, and call me crazy but I like to actually get my moneys worth.\n\nI'm all up for free speech but this is ridiculous. Attacking the PSN will only piss off users. Sony are making millions as I'm typing this, you think a few thousands to get things working again will change anything? Also, Hotz knew what he was getting into. He should man up and assume the risks he took. This is so juvenile. O MAN I JUS, LEIK, WANT'D TO MAEK SONY LOSES MILLIONZ BUT NOW I GOT CAUGHT SO HERE'S MY FELLOW GEEK SQUAD DEFENDIN ME !!! Seriously, THIS is lulz\n\n@LMW-STU: I printed out your post and put on my wall here. I simply can't stop laughing, thank you. Asking others to show respect to Japan while at the same time calling Japan f*cking, that takes mankind to a whole new depth.\n\n@Dancingdave Yes... it's very hard to admit that you've done something wrong, but if Playstation wants to be the bigger man in this then they should return it. I know this will cause an uproar but you got to spend a little, to gain a little Taking it from the start \"Your suppression of information\", so they're saying Sony is withholding company secrets; \"is motivated by corporate greed\" aka the desire to keep your profits to keep the company afloat. \"desire for complete control over the actions of individuals who purchase and use your products\" That sounds bad, right? Well he goes on to say that he lied by saying \"at least when those actions threaten the corrupt stranglehold you seek to maintain over copywrong, oops, copyright\" So he is saying that sony is attempting to keep users from breaking the LEGAL and totally understandable copyright and terms of use. I think that is reasonable for Sony to want. As far as company secrets, I'd hardly say that they are doing that. An overreaction by Anon. I respected them for the westboro church incident, but this is stupid.\n\nThe console comes first, what are these people stupid or something!? if the hackers could hack into consoles years ago then ok but if they are complaing now due to better security then its tough s**t! its about the heath of the industry and GAMING! all you hackers can just f**k off imo, how can they even have the right to complain! what a bunch of tossers!\n\n@djwood84 Agreed. But it doesn't really make his case any better. He is still the one to allow people to do this. Piracy will always be around, should he be able to walk free? I'm not saying lock the guy up but it's the same as Limewire being shut down because people were pirating songs.\n\nSo many wars going on now. Still no World War 3. And, I'm not American, but isn't hacking illegal and applisable to a 15-30 year jail sentence? And shame on them. SONy are in f*cking Japan! Show some respect, you inconsiderate pr*cks!\n\nGeoHot, Anonymous and the rest of the hackers\/pirates are nothing more than criminals and guess what anonymous has been threatening the United States goverment so that makes them Terrorists too. These guys only prove that they don't care about the industry of gaming entertainment we enjoy instead they want to steal and cheat their way in life.\n\n@mardinn 1: Returning the feature that endangered their service would be tantamount to admitting they didn't need to remove it in the first place. 2: It is endorsing the idea that the threat of cyber terrorism is enough to get what you want. 3: They are hardly spending ALL their money. 4: Litigation will create precedents that are helpful for the protection of intellectual property rights within the computer science industry.\n\nSince when is a DDOS attack called hacking? To me they're no more than kids who want to feel important on the internet. Also, they're getting organized on public Facebook page. That's how 1337 they are.\n\n@sosarene because pressing the big red button an taking millions of innocent people down with the big bad corporation for the greater good isn't the way to go about things. Anon is just another authoritarian organisation that seeks to exert its own point of view on others. Take a look at some of the actions they have taken. Disruption of government services on immigration and civil defence websites, disruption of services on the PSN. the keyword is service, they aren't hurting the big bad governments or big bad corporations they are hurting the people using their services. Why? because Anon does not want people using these services due to their opposition to these corporations. Think about the long term implications, people have to live in fear of their internet services being impaired because hacktivists like Anon do not agree with it. These same big bad corporations and governments whom provide millions of jobs, continuity within a nation, economic benefits and technological benefits are being hampered because some people don't agree with their point of view; where is the freedom in that?. Other entities who act like this to opposition include terroists, facists, dictatorships and authoritarians.\n\n@Dancingdave Maybe he deserves it, but still They are using All the money they have on this case and they can't even support the \"light\" weight that Anonymous is putting on the PSN network? I am just saying that GeoHotz did something stupid, but look here. There is a Simple Solution. The name of that simple solution would be OtherOS. If Sony has the brains (which they clearly do not have) they would implement the idea again and then they would not have these kinda problems because the ones attacking Playstation are the people who wants OtherOS to come back, not hacking or playing PSN on a hacked console."}

{"text":"Botnet\n\nBotnet is a jargon term for a collection of software robots, or bots, which run autonomously. A botnet's originator can control the group remotely, usually through a means such as IRC, and usually for nefarious purposes.\n\nA botnet can comprise a collection of cracked machines running programs (usually referred to as worms, Trojan horses, or backdoors) under a common command and control infrastructure. Individual programs manifest as IRC \"bots\". Often the command and control takes place via an IRC server or a specific channel on a public IRC network. A bot typically runs hidden, and complies with the RFC 1459 standard. Generally, the perpetrator of the botnet has compromised a series of systems using various tools (exploits, buffer overflows, as well as others; see also RPC). Newer bots can automatically scan their environment and propagate themselves using vulnerabilities and weak passwords. Generally, the more vulnerabilities a bot can scan and propagate through, the more valuable it becomes to a botnet owner community.\n\nBotnets have become a significant part of the Internet, albeit increasingly hidden. Due to most conventional IRC networks taking measures and blocking access to previously-hosted botnets, owners must now find their own servers. Oftentimes, a botnet will include a variety of connections, ranging from dial-up, DSL, cable, educational, and corporate. Sometimes, an owner will hide an IRC server installation on an educational or corporate site, where high-speed connections can support a large number of other bots. Exploitation of this method of using a bot to host other bots has proliferated only recently, as most script kiddies do not have the knowledge to take advantage of it.\n\nPurpose\n\nBotnets serve various purposes, including Denial-of-service attacks, creation or misuse of SMTP mail relays for spam, click fraud, and the theft of application serial numbers, login IDs, and financial information such as credit card numbers. The botnet owner community features a constant and continuous struggle over who has the most bots, the highest overall bandwidth, and the largest amount of \"high-quality\" infected machines (commonly university, corporate, and even government machines).\n\nOrganisation\n\nBotnet servers will often liaise with other botnet servers, such that a group may contain 20 or more individual cracked high-speed connected machines as servers, linked together for purposes of greater redundancy. Actual botnet communities usually consist of one or several owners who consider themselves as having legitimate access (note the irony) to a group of bots. Such owners rarely have highly-developed command hierarchies between themselves; they rely on individual friend-to-friend relationships. Often conflicts will occur between the owners as to who owns the individual rights to which machines, and what sorts of actions they may or may not permit.\n\nTypes of Attacks\n\nPreventive Measures\n\nIf a machine receives a Denial of Service attack from a botnet, few choices exist. Given the general geographic dispersal of botnets, it becomes difficult to identify a pattern of offending machines, and the sheer volume of IP addresses does not lend itself to the filtering of individual cases. Passive OS Fingerprinting can identify attacks originating from a botnet: network administrators can configure newer firewall equipment to take action on a botnet attack by using information obtained from Passive OS Fingerprinting.\n\nBotnets typically use free DNS hosting services such as DynDns.org, No-IP.com, and Afraid.org to point a subdomain towards an IRC server that will harbor the bots. While these free DNS services do not themselves host attacks, they provide reference points, often hard-coded into the botnet executable. Removing such services can cripple an entire botnet. Recently, these companies have undertaken efforts to purge their domains of these subdomains. The botnet community referto such efforts as \"nullrouting\", because the DNS hosting services usually direct the offending subdomains to an inaccessible IP address.\n\nThe botnet server structure mentioned above has inherent vulnerabilities and problems. For example, if one was to find one server with one botnet channel, often all other servers, as well as other bots themselves, will be revealed. If a botnet server structure lacks redundancy, the disconnection of one server will cause the entire botnet to collapse (at least until the owner(s) decides on a new hosting space). However, more recent IRC server software includes features to mask other connected servers and bots, so that a discovery of one channel will not lead to much harm"}

{"text":"\" \"\n\nback when the first ipad came out, AT&T set up a system for purchasers of the 3G model to register their email addresses on the device. because they're brainless turd-men, AT&T coded it in the worst way possible and left the system with such a massive security hole that anybody who cared could come along, change a number in a URL, and get customer data.\n\nthat's really the extent of the security flaw. it's not a case of serious hacking, there was no actual code exploitation in the traditional sense. literally just changing the string of numbers at the end of the URL would give you the email address of whichever person happened to be assigned to that string of numbers\u2014 that's how poorly AT&T hammered their shit together. of course, somebody eventually noticed it and wrote a script to automate the process. functionally it was exactly the same as just typing new numbers by hand, except that it was a scrap of code doing it instead. the dude in question, notorious shitpile and obnoxious beardgoon \"weev\", harvested a couple hundred thousand email addresses this way. not their passwords or contents, just the address itself.\n\nafter deliberation about what to do with the addresses he had harvested (including the idea of selling them to spammers, let's not forget that weev sucks a lot), he decided to take the \"noble\" route and expose the security flaw to a journalist. now, years later, he's going to prison for pointing out the security hole in the same way any number of \"white hat\" corporate-backed hackers might. what this means, among other things, is that at any given moment a legitimate \"security researcher\" can run afoul of a capricious district attorney or vengeful megacorporation, resulting in judicial harassment, draining of finances through legal costs, conviction and imprisonment, or worse.\n\nweev is a crap dude (no really look him up) and i can't stand him and he deserves to stub his toe really hard every day for the rest of his life, but he doesn't deserve to go to jail just because AT&T got embarrassed over their half-assed coding. you don't have to be a hacker to get caught up in the same way, and it's worth thinking about while you're out dicking around on the internet. the incredibly aggressive prosecution practices we're seeing in cases like this don't operate under any laws of logic or reason, with comparatively tiny actions by often well-meaning individuals being met with the full force of judicial authority for the sake of making a political point.\n\nkeep it in mind, allright? IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU\n\nAll of this. And I'm giving serious thought to writing a browser extension that makes a picture of weev's beard pop up on screen every time a girl types that she likes guys with beards, but still. As many other people have mentioned, also in the news today two guys raped an unconscious sixteen year old girl. They received a sentence only 43% as long as weev, even though weev only accessed publicly available data and didn't actually harm a single person or thing aside from AT&T's misplaced pride.\n\nOr: 3-way date-rape - less than half as terrible as pointing out shitty coding, according to the US Justice system. I don't doubt that here in the UK things would be much different, where also today our politicians finally responded to public disgust and outrage at tabloids acting as though they're above the law by setting out new legally enforceable press guidelines that conveniently could also be used to prosecute and effectively censor tweeters and bloggers because yes that's exactly what we wanted from all this you total evil motherfuckers.\n\nThe Internet's \"anarchy\" may seem strange or even unnatural, but it makes a certain deep and basic sense. It's rather like the \"anarchy\" of the English language. Nobody rents English, and nobody owns English. As an English-speaking person, it's up to you to learn how to speak English properly and make whatever use you please of it (though the government provides certain subsidies to help you learn to read and write a bit). Otherwise, everybody just sort of pitches in, and somehow the thing evolves on its own, and somehow turns out workable. And interesting. Fascinating, even. Though a lot of people earn their living from using and exploiting and teaching English, \"English\" as an institution is public property, a public good. Much the same goes for the Internet. Would English be improved if the \"The English Language, Inc.\" had a board of directors and a chief executive officer, or a President and a Congress? There'd probably be a lot fewer new words in English, and a lot fewer new ideas.\nPeople on the Internet feel much the same way about their own institution. It's an institution that resists institutionalization. The Internet belongs to everyone and no one.\n\nYou should also compare the largely unfettered evolution of modern English with that of French, which (in France at least) is carefully moderated, shaped and pruned by L'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in what most English people regard as a Canute-like attempt to stem the flow of loan-words into modern French (in part, because most of these loan-words are English, which the English find hilarious because the old rivalries never really go away). Is French better, stronger, and more relevant for this kind of control?Nick Clegg, above, is leader of the Liberal Democrats. They're Britain's 3rd political party. The vote is generally split mainly between Labour (used to be left wing, have drifted closer to centre & alienated lots of voters in their quest to please rich party donors) and the Conservaties (AKA the Tories, who are right wing, like to pretend they're centrists to catch swinging voters in elections, but then go right back to foaming at the mouth about poor people breathing their air).\n\nAnd then there's the Lib Dems.\n\nIn the 2010 general election Labour had pissed off a lot of their core voters, the Tories were pretending to soften their policies a bit, and the Lib Dems had Nick Clegg as party leader, who was seen as young and progressive. The party stood to have its best result ever, and finally become a proper force in British polictics.\n\nIn the end, the vote was split, and the Lib Dems had three options:\n\nRemain independent, and get to vote whichever way they pleased in parliament, thus essentially controlling all votes even though they technically weren't in charge.\n\nAlly themselves with Labour, the party that was ideologically incredibly close to them, making a coalition government whose supporters saw eye to eye on most issues.\n\nWhore themselves out to the Tories, who were quite clearly opposed to Lib Dem ideology, just for a tiny sniff of power.\n\nGuess which option Nick chose?\n\nAnd when I say they whored themselves, I mean they utterly capitulated on every single one of their primary election promises and totally betrayed the trust of every single person who voted for them, blackening their name in the public consciousness and virtually guaranteeing that in the next election they're going to lose dozens of seats in Parliament, being reduced to a fraction of the former influence and power that they'd slowly worked decades to build, and setting their cause back an incredibly long way.\n\nIt was maybe the dumbest move they could have made.\n\nBut Nick Clegg didn't think he could be friends with the leader of the Labour Party, Gordon Brown.\n\nYes, that is what his decision hinged upon.\n\nBritain has failed to recover from recession, libraries and community centres have been sold off cheap to developers, the NHS is in the worst state it's ever been as Tory hawks try to carve it up and sell it to their rich friends against the wishes of most Britons, jobless figures have risen, the gap between rich and poor has increased, only the wealthy can afford higher education, the economy has stagnated, everything feels like it's turning to shit, and it's all because Nick Clegg couldn't be fwends with Gordon Brown.\n\nCash Offer of the Day: Hustler head honcho Larry Flynt took out a full page ad in today's Washington Post, offering $1 million to anyone who could provide information about Mitt Romney's tax returns or various other assets.\n\nLarry clearly hasn't been keeping up with the times, because the people who supposedly have such information only accept Bitcoins.\n\nHeh, this is awesome. Those mad old bastards at the GOP have, amongst a raft of other Protecting American Americanism proposals (essentially, \"No Gays, No Abortions, No Muslims, No Fat Chicks\"), decided they really need to have a bug up their collective arse about making the internet \"safer.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nWell, making sure children can't gamble, making sure children can't meet Atheists online, making sure they can't see naked people, making sure that someone thinks about the children won't somebody think about the children?\n\nI can sort of see their point. Really, no sarcasm, those are kind of fair and reasonable things exceeeeppppptttt\u2026..\n\nExcept they're obviously going to just go mad with the power if they get a sniff of it aren't they? Ohhhhhh, those guys.\n\nAnd I really really really think they should set their sights squarely on those awful pornographers for a start. Which, those of you who know me, might find kind of sort of out of character a bit. But no, no no no, not at all. Let me explain:\n\nThe American porn industry is huge. Billions of dollars a year huge. Bigger than Hollywood. Bigger than all the sports franchises in the US combined. Bigger than their top TV broadcasters combined. Amazing. And this is a highly-connected tech-savvy industry too. Oh sure, you could take that giant on in a fight, but it's gonna cost you a hell of a lot of money and if you're successful then you put thousands of people out of work and shrink the American economy by billions of dollars. Hey, good luck with that.\n\nWhat do you think of when you picture a core GOP voter? Yup, it's a guy. For a party that has so many policies that can be harmful to women, for a party that doesn't even appear to understand women (\"spastic tubes\" and all that), it's refreshing to see them spreading the love around a little bit. Because while some women like to sample some nudey pictures, pretty much all men have indulged. Oh I'm generalising, I'm not even bothering to cite a source, this isn't a real debate and I'm not your real Dad! But I'm still totally right and you know it. Oh, hey politically dispossessed low-income blue-collar male, do you like internet porn and vote GOP because you don't want the gays and the brown people to tell you how to live? Yes, yes you do, don't you? I'd draw a Venn diagram of the prototypical GOP voters demographic, and people who like to download porn, but the two circles are perfectly aligned over one another, so it'd be a bit pointless.\n\nOther countries. Hello, yes America, the internet does not belong exclusively to you, so even if you manage to stop Americans making stuff you don't like, there's still another couple of hundred other countries in the world who you aren't in charge of, and porn in Myanmar or Djibouti or Vanuatu or wherever is just as easy for Americans to access as naked pictures hosted in California. All you'll do is shift that industry (and all the aforementioned billions of dollars) offshore.\n\nI get why you want to regulate this industry GOP, I really do, but you have no idea what you're doing, no idea of the magnitude of the task nor the massive negative impact your regulation would have on both the American economy and your popularity with voters.\n\nSo go ahead, take on that Sisyphean task, blow away your money and make people dislike you. I'm totally cool with that. Should keep you guys busy and out of power for a few years.\n\nFor"}
{"text":"Chinese cyberespionage network runs across 103 nations infections.\n\nThisOriginally posted by David Bradbury: ThisA way more plausible reason for there being no evidence in western\/american computers is, that the researchers did not have access to these networks. The article stresses how thankful they are to the mentioned organisations for giving them access to their computers. I don't think any american agency would provide that kind of access to researchers (be it canadian or us). Not to mention admitting being hacked by chinese ...\n\nClearlyAny major organisation (such as those targeted) whose IT department is so lacking that such an attack would succeed basically deserves it. Every organisation involves clearly needs to do a very serious IT audit as the next person to try this could be far more dangerous than the Chinese.\n\nThe reason then that the US and other countries which weren't infected is probably down to them having decent IT security on their systems.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWhat I mean to say is that IMO there is a great difference in responsibility between an email\/weblink attack and one that involved buying a zero day privilege escalation bug to do the attack.\n\nBlue Adept, there is no proof. There are indications that it is probably part of the Chinese military or gov't, but I can assure you, just because geo-location tells you an IP address is somewhere does NOT mean that it is, in fact, there.\n\nSo yes, while the evidence generally points in the direction of China as being responsible, this isn't a court case you could win, as it is all circumstantial.\n\nBesidesOriginally posted by TheFerenc: BesidesChina is hardly a halcyon of economic stability, and no amount of debt purchasing excuses them from cyber-espionage, oppression of minorities, or other egregious human rights violations the Chinese government is guilty of.\n\nAlsoLast but not least, to think that only China would run a network like this is rather naive. Of course, if it does exist IN THE FORM the Toronto research presents, and that's a big IF. I guess that similar research into similar activities of US or British intelligence would result in a series of arrests and charges of the members of any given research team.\n\nGreasy, I'm not saying it excuses them. And kitko is right about one thing for sure: the Tibet issue is much larger in the West than it ever was in China. Western media loves to trot out the Tibet issue whenever there isn't something else bad to say about the \"evil Chinese gov't.\"\n\nDoes China have issues? Yes. But so does the US, and pretty much every other western nation does as well. Human rights are important, I agree, but you have to keep one thing in perspective: cultures differ on what is accepted and expected. China has had a strong central gov't longer than most other nations have even existed. It is what works for them, and they seem to thrive within what, to us, would seem confining. Stop and think about this for a second: according to a study from a group at Leeds, people in China are at least as \"happy\" as most of the western nations, with the glaring outliers of the US and Canada being clearly happier. But I think a lot of that is a lack of education\/knowledge of reality, in pretty much every country.\n\nI'm no China apologist, whatever it might seem, but lets be honest, media is biased. Chinese media, Western media, neither is telling us the whole truth. While there are Tibet issues, I don't think they are as major as reported in the West, or as minor as reported in China. The truth, as always, lives somewhere in the middle. Where exactly that is, well, we'd probably have to move to Tibet and spend the rest of our lives digging to find out.\n\n\"Their investigation took place from June 2008 through March of 2009, and focused on allegations that the Chinese had engaged in systemic online espionage activities against the Tibetan community. GhostNet was spread through the use of a wide variety of Trojans, many of which were controlled through a program nicknamed gh0st RAT (Remote Access Tool).\"\n\nOkay, then...this is of particular interest for me for a weird reason:\n\nI've been doing the computer repairs for the local group of Tibetan monks-in-exile, or what have you (always good to do what you can to ba;ance karmic scales in your favor). Seems that every few months their computers are almost completely unusable, due to spyware\/virus infections. I guess this could go a long way toward explaining how this is happening.\n\nMy question: Would commercial or open source virus software have the definitions for these custom trojans? Would there be any way to effectively stop this maliciousness?\n\nYou know, upon reading the report, and realizing the scale of infiltration, and its tendency of targets being embassies and officials of countries neighbouring China, whoever set this up did so in China's direct interests. The discovery of this may be huge, like Gouzenko Affair huge.\n\nIts of no consequence wether it is China or not. Am surprised that people here are caught up in pointing fingers and assigning blame. Espionage is useful, it can sometimes help quell over eager folks from stabbing where they should not. All countries benefit. There is no international political will to make such capabilities\/activities part of international laws. The really interesting aspect is the notion that relatively simple exploits can compromise groups who should see the value in training of staff re security measures. The existence of other #Nets can be inferred and the authors of the study surmise that the capabilities will become more and more accessible to rouge regimes and criminal elements.

China is not likely to fund an attack on themselves. China has the worlds largest army, and is also a nuclear state. The US has a technologically superior yet incompentant army that is stretched ludicrously thin after two failed wars in the middle east.\n\nquote:\n\nOriginally posted by Greasy Breakfast: China is hardly a halcyon of economic stability\n\nIrrelevant. Seriously, I don't have to outrun the tiger, I just have to outrun you.\n\nThis is just the militarization of cybercrime by a number of American defense consultants who are looking to soak the DoD for cyberwar contracts.\n\nSilicon valley should be worried shitless where this is going because their whole economic model wont survive being militarized.\n\nBasically what is being advertised to the whole world is that the NSA has backdoors into every cisco router, that the F35 has kill switches in it's avionics, that laptops are being scanned at every airport and that US corporations are conducting espionage against their competitors.\n\nTemetka wrote: I do not find this surprising at all. Of course there are various Government sanctioned Ghost Net's. The question is: Is China the only country with one? My answer is a resounding \"NO.\" ----------------------------------\n\nExactly, China, Russia, US\/UK and various other country's all have their own espionage GhostNet's. Anyone thinking otherwise is pretty naive.\n\nOriginally posted by kitko: AlsoWhat's curious about it? I thought that the article was clear that the Tibetan organizations were examined because that's what the researchers had access to, and that instead of this being some conspiracy, it's sampling bias that was admitted in the original article.\n\nOriginally posted by Blue Adept: ClearlyI think it is rather premature to assume that Ars is denying Chinese espionage. Espionage is a very common and NORMAL activity that EVERY country participates in. Just because it came from China doesn't mean that the US isn't involved.\n\nSecondly, spoofing an IP is relatively easy, more so when someone is trying to resolve your IP address. Furthermore, there's also the issue with the translation between IPv4 and IPv6 which didn't seem to be mentioned at all. A good chunk of the world still uses IPv4 and it's also a fact that the entire IP address range for all networks in China is less than the IP address range of one US university. What this means is that if someone were to use the IPv6 protocol and hack into another system and spoof their IP all the way through, the IPv4 resolution would collide with an existing IP address or IP range within the IPv4 infrastructure. Long story short, you can pin the blame on someone else's IP address.\n\nThird, I think the report coming out less than a year after the study was conducted is rather suspicious. The only real way to investigate this sort of cyber-espionage is to have direct access to routing tables and the routing logs on the various ISPs. I seriously doubt that they had access at all to the various telecoms and ISPs."}
{"text":"TORONTO \u2014 An attempted cyber-attack on the NDP's electronic voting system Saturday forced party officials to delay the process of choosing the next federal New Democrat leader for several hours, frustrating voters both at the convention in Toronto and across the country.\n\nParty officials insisted the integrity of the voting system was not compromised, but acknowledged that the would-be hacker managed to \"mess'' it up enough to cause lengthy delays.\n\nHe stopped short of suggesting someone was deliberately trying to sabotage the NDP leadership process.\n\n\"I'm saying that somebody outside of the party was attempting to mess with our one-member, one-vote (system), but that the sanctity of our system was preserved because of the failsafes,'' Lavigne said.\n\nHe said he was told \"they did isolate it to two \u2014 or it may have been three \u2014 IP addresses, but they've resolved it.''\n\nParty president Rebecca Blaikie insisted that while the attempted attack proved a nuisance to the party and its voters, it did not penetrate the system nor compromise the voting results.\n\n\"Whoever this is or whatever it came from, their goal was simply to make it a pain to get into our site, to make it harder for people to vote, to block it up with a lot of traffic,'' Blaikie said.\n\n\"But traffic has nothing to do with security and so the vote itself is fine. It's just meant that we've had to have a lot more patience today than we thought.''\n\nEarlier, officials would say only that the system had been overwhelmed due to an unanticipated crush of voters all trying to cast their online ballots at the same time.\n\nBut that explanation was met with skepticism, since fewer than 10,000 New Democrats actually voted electronically on Saturday; the vast majority, some 56,000, had cast their ballots in advance.\n\nThe party hired Scytl, a Spanish-based company that specializes in electronic voting security, to run the online voting system.\n\nResults from the second round of voting were delayed about two hours to give every member who wanted to vote a chance to do so.\n\nFor those who voted in person at the convention, lengthy lineups at voting stations formed as the delays pushed balloting well into the afternoon.\n\nWhen third ballot results were finally announced, front-runner Thomas Mulcair had edged closer to victory, taking 43.8 per cent of the vote to Brian Topp's 31.6. Nathan Cullen came third with 24.6 per cent of the votes and was knocked off the ballot.\n\nPeggy Nash, Paul Dewar, Martin Singh and Niki Ashton were all knocked out of the race during first- and second-ballot voting.\n\nHow much do you want to bet that is was a Harperite that organized the attempted DDOS attack? Hell, if Harper is willing to rig a general election, he's more than willing to try and interfere with the party election of his main rivals. Police investigation in 3...2...1...\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nDDOS attacks are nothing like a weather event like a blizzard unless the event was caused by Dr. Evil and his International crime syndicate. These are malicious queries designed specifically to overwhelm a server and cause it to crash.\n\nA person, or persons, coordinated the attack on the NDP voting system to disrupt, delay, or subvert the democratic process. It sounds as though the security company has discovered an IP address. Let's hope it leads them to the criminal(s) who did this. It is highly likely he\/she\/they has\/have political Party affiliations.\n\nLoading comments\u2026\n\nPersonally I don't know why people insist that all voting must be done in the span of a few hours. Campaigns last weeks or months, and yet there's still this seemingly obsessive need to only allow votes for half a day.\n\nThe DOS attacks would be the equivalent of a blizzard hitting on the day of an election, preventing people from being able to cast a vote; though I'm sure in that cause people would be smart enough to go \"We'll reschedule\" or simply extend the period at which votes will be accepted.\n\nAdd_In_Canadia: Personally I don't know why people insist that all voting"}

{"text":"Researchers create virtual Android network to simulate attacks\n\nSummary: What happens to users and their phones in the event of a mobile malware epidemic or a terrorist attack? Researchers at a California-based lab are hoping to answer those very questions using simulations.\n\nResearchers at Sandia National Laboratories in California have developed a virtual Android-based network that can be used to simulate what could happen in the event of an attack on the devices.\n\nThe network, dubbed MegaDroid, consists of 300,000 virtual Android devices that receive spoofed GPS coordinates to simulate human movement throughout a town. Researchers have also combined the virtual network with Google Street View, so that they can watch, in real time, the virtual devices wandering around.\n\nResearchers hope that the simulation network will provide others with greater insight into what the cascading effects of a glitch in the network could result in \u2014 whether it's intentional or not \u2014 or what might happen in the event of a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\n\nMegaDroid will primarily be used as a tool to ferret out problems that would manifest themselves when large numbers of smartphones interact, said Keith Vanderveen, manager of Sandia's Scalable and Secure Systems Research department.\n\nOne such scenario that MegaDroid might be able to help researchers with is how malware might spread if attackers discover a way to propagate their malicious code over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.\n\n\"Smartphones are now ubiquitous and used as general-purpose computing devices as much as desktop or laptop computers,\" said Sandia cyber researcher David Fritz. \"But even though they are easy targets, no one appears to be studying them at the scale we're attempting.\"\n\nOther uses for the simulation network include tracking data leakage, and finding out how effective certain data-protection methods are.\n\nFritz and others at Sandia hope to release the code behind MegaDroid to the public, so that others can use it to build upon their work.\n\n\"Tools are only useful if they're used,\" said Fritz.\n\nResearchers already have a few ideas about the different directions in which others could fork the project.\n\n\"You could also extend the technology to other platforms besides Android,\" said Sandia Scalable and Secure Systems Research manager Keith Vanderveen. \"Apple's iOS, for instance, could take advantage of our body of knowledge and the tool kit we're developing"}
