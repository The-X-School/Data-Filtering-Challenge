By saying \"It is winter in here yet\" John is implying that in the room with Elizabeth it is emotionally cold. This is because Elizabeth didn't know that John would be out so late planting and thought that he may have gone to Salem. Here we see that Elizabeth still may not trust John because of what happened in he past with Abigail. 2. Mary Warren has disobeyed her employers and gone to Salem because she is an official of the court. 3. Abigail Williams reveals to John Proctor that the dancing didn't have anything to do with witchcraft. 4. John hasn't told the court what he knows because he and Abigail were alone when she revealed it to him and he has no proof of it. Elizabeth attributes his not telling to his trying to save Abigail.\n\n5. Elizabeth became more suspicious of John Proctor because he lied to her telling her that it was in a room of people that Abigail talked to him not them being alone.\n\n6. The news about the trials that Mary Warre reveals to John Elizabeth is that thirty nine women have been arrested and that Goody Osburn will hang. 7. Mary Warren acts different ways toward her employers at the beginning she acts towards them in a way to where they will have pity on her for she says she is sick, then she tells them everything they want to know about the trials, and then she is defiant towards them saying that John Proctor will not whi her and that she will do what she wants to do. 8. By saying \"I saved her life today\" Mary means that she defended Elizabeth when she was accused in court. 9. When she finds out that she has been accused, Elizabeth realizes that Abigail is trying to get her dead. 10. Elizabeth asks John to go to Abigail and call her a whore, and to break off any sense of a promise that Abigail may think John has made to her. 11. Reverend Hale visits the Proctors because he has been going around to everyone who has had their name associated with witchcraft. 12. Proctor responds to the questions about why he has not been to church by saying that at one point his wife has been sick, but then he admits that her does not trust Parris and sees no light of God him. 13. Reverend Hale asks Proctor to recite the ten commandments. 14. When reciting the ten commandments John Proctor forgot the one about adultery. When Hale reveals that Proctor had repeated one twice, and had left one out, Elizabeth tells John that it was the one about adultery. This contributes to the fact that John committed adultery against Elizabeth with Abigail. 15. John Proctor reveals to Reverend Hale that the children's sickness didn't have anything to do with witchcraft, and that the reason they were sick was because Mr. Parris came upon them in the woods and they were startled and became sick. 16. Reverend Hale wants John to testify to the information in court. 17. Elizabeth says that she doesn't believe in witches at this point because she doesn't believe that the Devil would own a woman's soul when they have walked uprightly. 18. Giles Corey reveals to the Proctors and Reverend Hale that his wife and Rebecca Nurse have been taken away to jail. 19. Rebecca Nurse has been accused of murder of Goody Putnam's babies. 20. Martha Corey has been accused because she had sold a pig to Wallcott years ago and soon after he bought the pig it died. Wallcott accuses Martha of bewitching all of his pigs with the books because they never live. 21.Ezekial Cheever and Marshal Herrick arrive at the Proctor home to take Elizabeth away to jail. 22. Cheever is both astonished and and afraid when he find the poppet with the needle in it because Abigail got stabbed by a needle in the belly and she said that it was Elizabeth's spirit that pushed it in and now in Elizabeth's poppet there was a needle. 23. John asks Mary Warren to come to court with him and charge murder on Abigail by telling the court that Abigail was responsible for the needle in the poppet. 24. Mary Warren is afraid to do what he asks because Abigail will kill her if Mary tells on her. 25. Mary Warren warns John about testifying against Abigail in court by telling him that Abigail will charge lechery on him. 26. John decides to still go to the court and testify against Abigail.\n\nmelissadawn 20 posts\nSunday, 13.

For Wednesday, come to class prepared to lead a discussion on the question you have chosen and also bring the beginning of a rough draft. The final essay will be on the order of two pages in length (1.5 spacing, 10 font.)\n\nThe British Hunter, Robert Wilson, respects neither one of the Macombers, whom he is guiding on safari. Summarize his attitude toward each of them. Does he have more contempt for one or the other? Do you agree with Wilson's assessment of them? If so, why? What, on the other hand, is your assessment of Wilson, both for the attitude he has toward them and the way he treats them?\n\nIn your reading of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\", is Robert Wilson a teacher or tyrant, a hero or bully \u2013 or is he a bit of each? Does he take advantage of a weaker man? Or is his cruelty calculated to redeem Macomber' life in some way? We know how things end for Francis. How do they end for Margot?\n\nWe've noted the themes of manliness and nature in Hemingway's stories. The first theme involves a code of behavior emphasizing stoicism, courage and, in his famous phrase, \"grace under pressure.\" The second stresses the curative, purifying, redemptive powers of the natural world as opposed to the lack of honor, moral shallowness and corruption of so-called civilization. How do these themes play out in \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber?\n\nWhy is the life of the story's title character described both as \"short\" and \"happy?\" What is \"happy\" about the life that ends on the last page? What philosophy about the meaning of life does Hemingway mean to convey by the situation he describes in this story? Are the values he ascribes to Robert Wilson meant to be taken by the reader as admirable? What are the moral issues Hemingway raises in this story?\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Review the images of Gilded Age New York in the pages of Illustrated History of New York - and categorize them according whether they illustrate \"Sunshine\" or \"Shadow\" during the Gilded Age. If you're not sure what the image represents explain why.\n\n2. Choose one person, place, thing or event from the identifications below and do some preliminary research on the internet - site your source(s) \u2013 and write a brief analysis of the item's historic significance for understanding the history of New York City during the Gilded Age.\n\nWeek XI November 22-24, 2010\n\nSunshine and Shadow, New York \u2013 1860 \u2013 1898\n\nDiscussion: The end of the Civil War brought with it reunion between the North and South, and reunion brought with it new opportunities for New York to grow into the national metropolis - and one of world's largest and most powerful cities by the end of the nineteenth century. New York was the national metropolis by the end of the Civil War with a population of between 800,000 to one million people. This number would have been unimaginable just a couple of generations earlier. Imagine, then, that by the year 1900 the city would more than triple in size reaching a population of fully 3,000,000 people. By the end of World War I, just twenty years later, New York would become the world's largest city and truly the capital of the world. In this chapter we continue to observe this dizzying 19th ascent and the challenges brought about by ever bigger bigness. Commerce, immigration, population growth and geographical expansion, continue to be major themes of the story. But now the problems associated with rampant capitalism and poverty produced a wider and wider gap between the privileged and the poor. Add to this the massive \"new Immigration\" between the years 1886 and 1924 and one begins to understand the meaning of the metaphor that is the title of the chapter. New York was, indeed, two worlds, one \"Sunshine,\" the other \"Shadow,\" one a world of the rich and privileged, the other a world of unimaginable hardship, deprivation, horrible working and living conditions and despair. It was also a time of extraordinary achievement, aspiration, invention and productivity. This troubled, varied and often fabulous New York is our subject.\n\nMajor themes\n\nReunion and reconstruction: New York as the national metropolis\n\nThe Gilded Age: Boom and Bust, Bulls and Bears\n\nDemocratic aspirations: Central Park\n\nThe \"New Immigration\" \u2013 1886 \u2013 1924 (13.5 million people enter through New York)\n\nThe new urban political machine\"- the case of William M. \"Boss\" Tweed and Tammany Hall\n\n1. Give three examples of racism in New York City during the decades before the Civil War, taking into account the social, economic, and political conditions in which the African American population found itself.\n\n2. What is the issue that the author discusses in Chords of Caste?\n\nWeek VI \u2013 May 16-20\n\nOrder and Disorder \u2013 New York, 1825-60\n\nThis week we study of the transformative events of the period 1825-1860.\n\n1. Transportation has been a continuing factor in the evolution of New York since the Half Moon sailed up what would be named the Hudson River in 1609. Discuss five different episodes in the history of transportation that transformed the history of this city during the first half of the 19th century.\n\n2. New York City is, and has always been, a \"city of immigrants,\" starting with the diverse population that arrived during the Dutch period, right up until the present day, when almost 40% of the City's population is foreign born. Describe this pattern in the early 19th century. What immigrant groups arrived here? What was their impact? Were there tensions and conflicts between those who had called New York home for generations and those newly arrived? What were these tensions? How did they affect the politics and the culture of the City in the years prior to the Civil War? Have immigrant groups been welcomed with open arms to New York? Give examples. How have various groups struggled and risen through the \"social geography\" of the city?\n\n3. The period from 1825 to 1860 was a time of truly unprecedented growth, change and challenge to every New Yorker:\n\n1. The population grew from around 200,000 to nearly one million people.\n\n2. Increasing diversity made this growth even more disorienting.\n\n3. Economic and technological changes created upheavals in the social and cultural lives of every New Yorker, in the ways they lived and worked, in the way they communicated, and in the ways they related to each other. Crime, poverty, racial and ethnic conflict disease, mand much more plagued a city seemingly unequipped to handle its sudden transition into the modern world, a city\n\nYour author refers to the sum total and impact of these changes as producing a period of \"disorder\" \u2013 not a very optimistic assessment. Give examples of some of the economic, social and cultural challenges and problems that descended upon the little city that became a metropolis in just a few decades. If you lived in New York during this time, what do you think the impact of these dramatic change and growth would have been on your life?\n\n4. Along with the \"disorder\" created by the rapid changes in New York City during this period, as it developed into a new kind of city \u2013 a metropolis, which by the Civil War was already bursting with nearly one million people. Historians have also focused on the attempts at improving life, making it more modern and efficient, attempting to establish some kind of pattern for the future and stabilize daily life. Give examples of these efforts to impose \"order\" on the obvious disorder of the teaming city.\n\n\"Discussion of Major themes\n\nThe period 1825 to 1860 was a time of truly unprecedented growth, change and challenges to every New Yorker. Imagine that you maintain an organized bedroom, in an organized home, in an unchanging neighborhood. You rely on this organization and predictability in your life. Then, while you're overnight at a friend's, a windows are left open, there's a storm, and gusts of wind and rain damage and disorganize everything you rely on for normal life. When you return, nothing is the way you left it. You would be disoriented, to say the least. You would face disorder in every in every part of your life. You would begin, with the help of others, to try to restore some order in your life. Something like this is what happened to New York as it was transformed by the \"storm\" of history from a small, intimate town into a metropolis in a couple of generations. Not only did the population increase from 90,000 at the beginning of the century to 750,000 by the time the Civil war began. Different kinds of people from those who had settled and lived here for two hundred years. These \"Knickerbockers\" had dominated social, civic and economic life of the city. Now, as Germans and Irish immigrants poured into New York, their privileged position was threatened. We will observe the City's unprecedented growth (both in population and geographic expansion) and transformation (in terms of industrialzation, transportation, commerce, class and race, demography, media and communications, policing, public health, and much more. These developments ended the intimacy of the old \"walking city\" and ushered in new relationships characteristic of the modern metropolis? Would you have liked to live in \"gaslight New York\"?\n\nThemes of the period:\n\nI New York City expands more rapidly than any city in history. From the small town of a few thousand people in the 1780 it becomes to the metropolis of 1865, with a population of three quarters of a million.\n\nII The impact of the \"Transportation Revolution\" on New York City\n\n1. Robert Fulton's development of the steamboat, 1807\n\n2. The development in 1811 of New York City's grid plan, New York's familiar grid of streets and avenues, one of the most recognizable aspects.\n\n3. The Age of Sail reaches its peak even as new forms of transportation develop. Americans build the sleekest, fastest sailing vessels in the world that voyage to every continent and open up world trade centered on New York. The famed Yankee Clippers were the fastest ships on the world. In 1817 ,scheduled packet service \u2013 the first being The Black Ball Line in 1817, replaces individual contracting of merchants with ship captains, making the system of booking passage predictable and rational.\n\n4. The Erie Canal, completed in 1825, seals New York's position, predicted since Hudson's voyage in 1609, as the preeminent hub of Atlantic \u2013 and eventually, global \u2013 trade.\n\n5. The railroad era, beginning in the late 1820\u2032s, put an end to the construction of canals. The career of Cornelius Vanderbilt, a pioneer of transportation on both water and by rail, is symbolic of the passing of an age and the beginning of a new one. Travel by sea was for thousands of years the only alternative to walking or being drawn by animals on land. Now the \"iron horse,\" powered by the steam locomotive ushered in a new technology that shrunk time and space. Vanderbilt became the nation's premier shipping magnate, and then in the 1840s, switched to rail, becoming the most powerful railroad owner in the world.\n\nII The first great wave of immigration into New York City during the 1840s, primarily German and Irish.\n\nIII A Sense of History: Reacting to rapid population growth and immigration of different ethnicities, a new sense of history develops in New York City during the period prior to the Civil War. The role of Washington Irving, who was New York's first internationally known author, is very important in this development. His book, The Knickerbockers History of New York gave rise to the term \"Knickerbockers\" referring to native born New Yorkers of Dutch or English descent during a period of increasing anxiety about the influx of foreigners into New York.\n\nIV Geographical expansion of New York. John Jacob Astor buys up real estate all over the City and sells it to contractors as New York expands northward. One such block was Charlton Street, and one such building was our new school building at 42 Charlton Street!!\n\nV The Industrial Revolution in New York City: the rise of the factory system and the decline of traditional economic and social relationships. By the 1840s New York is the nation's largest industrial center. The east river on both the Manhattan and Brooklyn sides was the industrial hub of the city, with smokestacks rising, hundreds of employees working in manufacturing, and as much as 15% of the nation's wealth centered in the area from Greenpoint to Brooklyn Heights and 23rd street to the Battery.\n\nVI The New Politics and the Rise of Tammany Hall\n\nVII Class and Race in antebellum New York\n\n1. \"Slavery by another name\" \u2013 the case of the St. Augustine's Church slave galleries.\n\n2. The rise of the workingman's movement in New York City\n\n3. Class markers in consumption and recreation: the case of Central Park\n\nWeek V \u2013 May 8-14\n\nThis week we will be reading about and discussing the emergence of New York City briefly as the nation's political capital, and then, permanently, as the nation's financial and commercial capital. Be prepared for each day's class having read the following pages and answered the accompanying questions.\n\nReading \u2013 Burns, pp. 21-27 Slavery and racism in colonial New York\n\n1.

What was the political result of the American victory at Saratoga? .\n\n2.. What was the magnitude of the force the British assembled in New York Harbor in the summer of 1776? Describe the strategy of the British as they moved to secure New York City in August of 1776.What were the major encounters during the Battle of Long Island \u2013 also known as the the Battle of Brooklyn?\n\n3. What was the condition of New York City in the years immediately following the conclusion of the American War for Independence?\n\n4. In the years following the victory over England, New York evolved from the political capital of the nation to its economic one. How would New York City history been different if it had remained the capital of the United States?\n\n5. Describe the development of New York City's economy during the years after the War for Independence concluded in 1783. How did advances in transportation propel New York City to the forefront of the nation during the first decades of the nation's existence.\n\nReading, Burns, pp. 56-67 America's City\n\nWhat was the significance and the impact of the construction of the grid system of streets and avenues in 1811?\n\nIs it fair to describe the construction of the Erie Canal as in some way the fulfillment of the dream of Henry Hudson?\n\nWeek IV \u2013 V April 25-29; May 2-5\n\nWe reach the end of the Adriaen Van der Donck saga. In doing so we understand the question we began with: Why did the Dutch colony fail; or as we often phrased it, Why don't we speak Dutch?\n\nReadings: In order to answer the following questions on Chapters 11-14, read my summaries and check the references to specific pages or passages in the book itself , cited in the summaries, for further clarification.Your answers are due Monday, May 8th.\n\nWritten Questions:\n\nChapter 11 \u2013 \"An American in Europe\" \u2013 When did Van der Donck return to the Netherlands? Why? What did he find there \u2013 in terms of the political atmosphere? What argument did he make to the States General? Who were his political enemies? What was the decision of the Dutch government with respect to the colony's government and management? What orders does it send to Director General Stuyvesant? What does Van der Donck accomplish with respect to the government of New Amsterdam.

The glacier began to recede some 15,000 years ago leaving behind an \"archipelago\" of island \u2013 of today's five boroughs only the Bronx is part of the mainland United States \u2013 some 70 miles of shoreline and hundred of islands.\n\nTo understand the force and impact of the glacier \u2013 called the Wisconsin Glacier - imagine a huge steam shovel, digging huge trenches or troughs as the land froze and the ice sheet advanced down from the arctic circle. Except the steam shovel is actually the southern-most edge of the ice, and as it proceeds, it mixes everything in its path in with the ice.It dug huge troughs like the Hudson Valley and shallower flatlands all over what is now New York City. There was so much sea water frozen into he glacier, by the way, that the actual shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean off New York, New England and much of New Jersey was up to 150 miles east of where it is now.\n\nThis all started 75,000 years ago. Then about 15,000 years ago, the glacier started to melt. It receded northat different speeds, depending on how cold it was for a given stretch of hundreds of years. And as it melted over a particular spot in the geography, it deposited the mud and rock it had dug and mixed with ice on the way down . So if the glacier took a long time to melt over a particular spot, it deposited more mud \u2013 eventually dry land \u2013 over that spot. Today those locations form higher points in the terrain of the City. Often their names remind of of this fact, for example Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, or Murray Hill Manhattan. Other spots indicate the glacier was melting fast when it receded over that spot. Hence, Flatbush, Brooklyn, or the Harlem Valley in Manhattan at around 100-110 streets on the west side. At first, with all this water being deposited, most of Manhattan was flooded, leaving the island, especially the lower half, a perpetual swamp or actually underwater. (This is what could happen with increased global warming today.) Another reason is that the melted ice water had nowhere to drain in to ocean. Why? Because the channel now spanned by the Verazzano Bridge was a barrier reef, like a cork in the bottle of water formed by New York Bay. Eventually that cork popped, and the result about 10,000 years ago was the geography we recognize today.\n\nAt this point about 8,000 years ago, the native inhabitants that Henry Hudson would later encounter, entered the scene. These natives were the Lenape Indians, part of the great Algonquian peoples that stretched across the northeast and even north-central United States. Another name for them is The Delaware Indians. Europeans first made contact in the early 17thcentury with the arrival of Henry Hudson, an English navigator sailing for the Dutch West India Company. Hudson's voyage was part of a \"Great Age of Exploration\" that included all the great European powers facing the Atlantic Ocean. (Classical Civilization - Greek and Roman civilization \u2013 was basically a Mediterranean culture.) Other transformative forces providing the context of the Dutch exploration and settlement of North America included the Protestant Reformation, the Commercial Revolution, the Scientific Revolution, and the first stirrings of the rise of democratic thought and values, one important manifestation of which was the establishment of a republican form of government in The Netherlands, which for all intents and purposes gained it's independence in 1579, although the formal recognition of the fact of it's independence didn't come until 1648. A formal truce between the years 1609 and 1620 gave the now powerful rebellious province of Spain to enter the race for colonies in North America. This, of course, was the year Henry Hudson sailed the Half Moon under the Dutch Flag and joined the race to find the fabled \"northwest passage.\"\n\nPowerful Atlantic powers were scrambling to find the northwest passage because it was supposedly a water route through the North American continent to the Pacific Ocean, thus providing renewed access to the Orient. The search was made necessary by grand historical developments that began almost a thousand years earlier \u2013 the great battle between Christianity and Islam, which culminated in 1554 in the capture of Constantinople , thus interrupting the overland trading route to the Orient which had been traveled by Europeans since at least the time of Marco Polo (13th century) and spurred the search for new routes by sea.\n\nThe first Atlantic nation to do so was Portugal, which first circumnavigated Africa, sailed the Indian Ocean, colonized to the subcontinent (India) and continued on to Cathay (China) and the South Asia Sea. This led to the voyages of Columbus, the first to dare the uncharted waters of the Atlantic itself, sailing west to find the east, and famously succeeding in 1492. Soon, all the major western and northern European nation states participated: Spain, England, Scotland Portugal, France, Sweden and others. A cold \u2013 and often hot \u2013 war ensued: a great centuries-long rivalry involving colonization across the globe, submission of native groups who objected, organized privateering (piracy) and often outright armed conflict. These ambitious and powerful states motivated by rivalries for colonies and resources spawned a new financial and commercial class (the bourgeoisie) and then tapped their wealth by chartering joint stock trading companies and establishing colonies. The English dominated the east coast of North America \u2013 Jamestown Virginia, 1607, and New England \u2013 Plymouth 1620, and Massachusetts Bay, 1629. The Spanish dominated South America, the French, Canada and the interior of North America, and all of them took a part of the Caribbean Sea. Even Sweden established a colony in North America, on the Delaware River, which the Dutch squashed in 1655.\n\nBut it was the upstart United Provinces of the Netherlands that with Hudson's voyage grabbed, perhaps the most valuable piece of the international colonial puzzle: the section of the eastern coast of what is now the United States of America. It included what is now New York, New Jersey and part of Connecticut. This colony would be named New Netherland by the Dutch West India Company, the trading Company the Dutch established in 1621 to run things. In 1609, it signed up an English navigator named Henry Hudson to search for the Northwest Passage. After two failed attempts, he tried a third route, and on September 12, 1609, sailed through the Verrazano Narrows and entered the Upper Bay of New York harbor, inaugurating the Dutch colony in the New World. It would last until 1664 when the British captured it.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nHow was the geography of New York City formed by the Wisconsin glacier? How long did this process take?\n\nWho were the native inhabitants of the area when Europeans made contact during the early 16th century?\n\nDescribe the rise of the Dutch nation \u2013 The United Provinces of the Netherlands \u2013 during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In what areas did this new nation become one of the leaders of Europe? What accounts for this so-called \"Golden Age of the Dutch?\" Name some of the individuals who we associate with this period.\n\nWhen did the Dutch rule New Netherland?\n\nWas the colony simply a trading post, a purely business proposition? Or was it a colony, with a government, laws and settlers? Why is this question important?\n\nName the company chartered by the Dutch government in 1621 to manager the colony. What was the title given to the executive director of the company in North America? Who would you say were the most important men to fill this position during the Dutch period?\n\nWho was Adriaen Van der Donck? What was his relationship with three older men who were prominent in the history of New Netherland: Killiaen Van Renssalaer, Willem Kieft and Peter Stuyvesant?\n\nWhat were Van der Donck's goals for the colony? Why did this put him in direct conflict with Peter Stuyvesant. Where did Van der Donck make his case during the period 1650-1653? What happened in the States General \u2013 the government of the United Provinces of the Netherlands\n\n1. If geography is destiny, explain why New York City was destined to become one of the most economically powerful cities on earth. How did the Wisconsin Glacier create the geography and topography of New York City and its environs beginning 15,000 years ago?\n\n2. Who was Henry Hudson? Why did he sail for the Dutch? What kind of man was he? What happened to him? What was the name of his ship? Describe the adventures he had on his voyages to what became New York?\n\n3. The Dutch were the most powerful nation in 17th century Europe. What was the source of their economic power? What advantage s did they bring to the \"cold war\" (and often hot wars) of the 16th and 17th centuries? Why did they seek a colony on the Atlantic coast of North America?What made the late 16th and 17th centuries the Dutch Golden Age? pp. 16-17; search for the Northwest Passage\n\n4. Who were the native inhabitants of New Netherland? How did their culture compare to that of the Europeans who arrived in the early 17th century? What was the impact of globalization on the native peoples they encountered?What were core characteristics of the culture and society of the Lenape? How did this culture adapt to the introduction of European culture during the Contact Period? \"The Dutch Buy Manhattan,\" pp. 48-49\n\n5. What was the main economic activity of the Dutch settlers? What was the relationship of settlers to the company? Ultimately, was New Amsterdam in particular, and New Netherland in general, a colony or a company, a civil community or a trading post? Why is this important?\n\n6. How did the Dutch settlers and the natives get along? Who was Willem Kieft and what fierce conflict broke out during the 1840\u2032s?\n\nOn the basis of the reading be able to define and discuss the following Key Terms. Have this sheet available at all times during class discussions, when we will amplify these terms' meaning and relevance for the history of the Dutch period \u2013 1609-1624."}

Then the lies start to snowball, until Parker turns up dead. Or does he?\n\nMary Bliss's formerly staid existence careens into overdrive as she copes with an oversexed teenager, a mother-in-law with Ethel Merman delusions, and the sudden but delicious shock of finding herself pursued by two men: -- and the perfect recipe for chicken salad.\n\n1. Mary Bliss and Katherine have been friends for more than a decade, and the saying \"opposites attract\" seems to describe their friendship.

Mary Bliss visits Eula regularly at the nursing home, cooks her favorite foods, and brings her flowers. Even after Parker leaves, Mary Bliss continues to visit Eula. Why is Eula so hostile to Mary Bliss? Why does Mary Bliss feel such a sense of responsibility for Eula? Did Eula's decision about her estate surprise you?\n\n6. There are references throughout the story to Mary Bliss's childhood. \"Her own daddy, James Clewitt, had abandoned his family. Had told her mama he was going to Florida to look for work.. Drove away in a 1968 green Ford Falcon. And that was that. Never to return.\" How have the circumstances of Mary Bliss's childhood affected her as an adult? She sees Parker's behavior as worse than her father's because \"Parker had not only abandoned them, he'd stolen their future.\" Do you agree with Mary Bliss on this?\n\n7. Discuss the relationships Mary Bliss has with the women in her life -- Katharine, Erin, Eula -- and how each one is important to her.\n\n8. Katharine plays an integral role in the plan to fake Parker's death. Why does she do this? Is it merely because she's Mary Bliss's best friend, or are there other reasons?\n\n9. Mary Bliss and Matt Hayslip meet under unusual circumstances, and she does not particularly like him at their first meeting. What changes her mind about him? Mary Bliss and Matt's relationship is clouded by lies and deception. In one instance he says to her, \"What about you? Are you capable of telling the truth?.\" As she says about their relationship, \"they had done everything backward.\" Why, ultimately, does their relationship work?\n\n10. The title of the book, Little Bitty Lies, is an understatement. What do you think of the lies that abound in the book? Is there any character who does not resort to lies and deception? During a conversation with Charlie, Mary Bliss feels bad for deceiving him but has \"already made an uneasy peace with her conscience, telling herself the ends justified the means.\" In Mary Bliss's case, do you think the ends justified the means?"}

What about her background gives her empathy for her characters?\n\nWhat trends in immigration did she show?\n\nWhat is Enrique's living situation before and after his mother leaves? How does he feel after his mother leaves? Does this compare to any emotions you have ever felt?\n\nWhy does Enrique decide to go to the North? What would you have done?\n\nWhat negative habits does Enrique develop in his mother's absence? How does this compare to negative habits that college students adapt when separated from their families?\n\nWhat happens to Enrique on his journey?\n\nWhat are the attitude of many Mexicans toward Enrique and other Central Americans immigrants?

How would you react?\n\nWhat does Enrique do at the border?\n\nHow does Enrique cross the border?\n\nHow does Enrique find his mother? What events make this more difficult?\n\nThe author says that immigration is \"a powerful stream, one that can only be addressed at its source.\" What is the meaning of this statement?\n\nDiscuss Enrique's relationship with his mother. How is that relationship different from the relationships each has with other people?\n\nWhat does the author mean when she says that for these children, finding their mothers \"becomes the quest for the Holy Grail\"?\n\nContrast the images of the United States that Lourdes\/Enrique see on television versus what each finds in the United States.\n\nContrast the descriptions of the first attack Enrique endures on his journey with the first\n\nkindnesses he is shown.\n\nDiscuss the attitudes toward immigrants and immigration Lourdes and Enrique encounter in Honduras, Mexico, and the United States.

How do they seek to overcome these factors?\n\nContrast Enrique's life in the United States with the life he left behind.\n\nDivide the class in 1\/2 and have them form and inner and outer circle, students stand facing each other.\nTell them to introduce themselves to the person they're facing and explain that you'll ask a question and that they need to exchange answers.\nThen, the outer circle shifts to the left . . . and you'll ask another question. They should introduce themselves to their new partner EACH time. Questions and shifting should be somewhat rapid.\nYou might try to ask some general questions first to get students started.\n\nHere are some question possibilities:\nEnrique's Journey\nWho do you most admire?\nWhat's your favorite book?\nHow much of Enrique's Journey did you read?\nWhat do you think about immigration?\nDid Enrique's Journey influence how you feel about immigration?\nWhich character in the book did you most identify with?\nWhat was your favorite part of the book?\nWhat was your least favorite part of the book?\nWhat would you do differently than Enrique?\nTalk about a time when someone really supported you.\n\nThe Social Barometer Exercise\n\nThere are two ways to set up the exercise:\nExplain to students that you will make a statement, and that based on their agreement OR disagreement with the statement, they should place themselves along a continuum\/spectrum. Emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers. Designate one side of the room as \"Strongly Agree\" and the other side as \"Strongly Disagree\". Students can place themselves anywhere along the continuum. Randomly call on students along the continuum to explain why their views and placement.\nSimilarly, explain that you will make a statement and that based on their position, they will group themselves under one of the four signs you've posted around the room. Emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers. Post on each of the four classroom walls, \"Strongly Agree,\" \"Agree,\" \"Disagree\" and \"Strongly Disagree.\" Once grouped under their position, students should talk amongst themselves to discuss why they chose this position. Call on a spokesperson from each of the four groups to explain their views to the rest of the class.\nOther things to consider:\nThe key question for the facilitator is \"Why do you strongly agree or strongly disagree with this statement?\"\nYou can allow students to change positions\/locations if someone says something that persuades them to modify their original viewpoints\nDiscussion shouldn't get too personal or chaotic\nTry to call on many different students to keep everyone involved.\nYou might start with a more innocuous topic first to get the feel for the exercise. \"My parents really miss me,\" \"The Lumberjacks will win the homecoming game this year.\"\n\nHere are some statements you could use for the book, Enrique's Journey:\nIt is important for the US to allow Latin Americans into the country.\nI admire Enrique for the journey he made.\nI think that Enrique's mother made a good choice to leave her family and go to the United States to make money.\nIf I lived in Veracruz and was really poor, I would share food and clothes with the people riding on the train.\nI learned a lot from reading this book.\nMexican and Latin American immigrants should be treated better by the border patrol.\nI believe that immigrants should not be allowed to stay in the US.\nI think that it's right for Mexico to deport Latin American immigrants who are riding the train.\nI think it's important that people know about the issues discussed in this book.\nThink of your own statements that will get students to take a position.\n\nFor more information:\n\n inst_resources\/social_barometer.pdf\n\nAgree\n\nDisagree\n\nStrongly Agree\n\nStrongly Disagree\n\nEnrique's Journey Debate\n\nFacilitator Guidelines:\nSet up a debate by dividing the class into two sides. You can either allow them to group themselves by position or randomly number them into two groups.\nExplain that each side will have a few minutes to prepare a list of reasons why their position will be supported and formulate a position statement.\nAllow each side to present their statement and then facilitate a back and forth discussion between the two sides.\n\nPossible debate ideas:\nShould the US allow more Latin Americans to immigrate?\nIs it right for Latin American parents to leave their children behind when they go to the US to try to make money? Should parents come to the US to try to make money?\nShould Mexican and Latin American immigrants try to \"fit in\" in the US?\n\nQuotable Quotes\n\nFacilitator Guidelines:\n\nDistribute a quote from the book to each student in the room. (There are some on the following pages you might consider.)\nHave them read the quote and think about what it means to them.\nStudents should get up, introduce themselves to another student, read their quote and give a brief explanation of what it means, whether or not they agree, etc.\nSince different students might react differently to the quotes, it would be okay to have duplicate quotes.\nQuotes\n(there are 20 provided here)\n\nPg. 27 \"In one neighborhood near where Enrique's mother grew up, fifty-two children arrive at kindergarten each morning.

{"text":"The Seamstress\n\nA Novel\n\nAs seamstresses, the orphaned sisters Em\u00edlia and Luzia dos Santos know how to cut, how to mend, and how to conceal. These are useful skills in the backcountry of Brazil, where vigilantes called cangaceiros make the rules. Em\u00edlia dreams of falling in love and escaping to the city. Luzia also longs to escape their little town, where residents view her with suspicion because of her deformed arm and her quick temper.\n\nBut when Luzia is abducted by a group of cangaceiros led by the infamous Hawk, the sisters' quiet lives diverge in ways they never imagined. Em\u00edlia stumbles into a marriage where her glamorous life is soon overshadowed by heartache and loneliness. Luzia, forced to trek through scrubland and endure a nomadic existence, begins to see the cangaceiros as comrades, not criminals.\n\nLuzia will overcome time and distance to entrust her sister with a great secret\u2014one Em\u00edlia vows to keep. And when Luzia's life is threatened, Em\u00edlia will risk everything to save her.\n\nQuestions for Discussion\n\n1. How does their shared childhood as poor, religious, orphaned seamstresses shape Em\u00edlia and Luzia's unique perspectives on life?\n\n2. How does access to water define political power in a country like Brazil in the 1920s and 1930s? How did the author's descriptions of extreme drought affect your appreciation of modern conveniences?\n\n3. How does the Hawk's treatment of Luzia in the caatinga, or scrub, reveal Ant\u00f4nio's true nature?\n\n4. What does Em\u00edlia's reception into Recife society indicate about the esteem in which the Coelho family is held? To what extent is her mother-in-law, Dona Dulce Coelho, overly concerned about others' perceptions of Em\u00edlia?\n\n5. To what extent are secrets responsible for the marriage between Degas and Em\u00edlia and, much later, for its disintegration?\n\n6. How does Luzia's behavior in the initial aftermath of Ant\u00f4nio's death explain her success in becoming the new captain of the cangaceiros? In what other ways does her behavior change once the Hawk is dead?\n\n7. How do Dr. Duarte's interests in phrenology and politics and his import-export business connect him to the government's search for The Seamstress and the Hawk?\n\n8. At various points in the novel, how does Dr. Eronildes Epifano represent both salvation and damnation to the cangaceiros? What role does Degas play in alerting Em\u00edlia to Dr. Eronildes's duplicity?\n\n9. Given The Seamstress's attacks on innocent people, to what extent are Em\u00edlia's efforts to communicate information to Luzia through newspaper articles and photographs ethically defensible?\n\n10. How does the book's final image connect with earlier images of bones in The Seamstress? Why do you think the author chose to close her book with this image?\n\nAbout the Author\n\nFrances de Pontes Peebles was born in Pernambuco, Brazil and raised in Miami, Florida.

In \"Code Breaking\" Melinda discusses her English class where the students are reading \"The Scarlett Letter\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne. In \"The Scarlett Letter\" there is a great deal of symbolism. The book, which is set in colonial New England, takes place in a conservative, religious, Puritan community. The main character, Hester, becomes pregnant in the absence of her husband. This is a mortal sin in this community. Hester is arrested and punished by the town. During this era punishment for adultery was extreme. Hester is shunned by the community (no one will speak to her, associate with her, or be friends with her) and she is forced to wear a scarlet letter \"A\" on the exterior of all her clothing. The \"A\" stands for adultery and is meant to mark her as a sinful, shamed woman.\n\nMelinda identifies with Hester. She, too, feels shunned by her community. She imagines that she has a giant \"S\" on her clothing. Write an essay addressing the following:\n\nWhy does Melinda relate with Hester?\n\nWhat would the \"S\" stand for on Melinda's clothing?\n\nHow do both women suffer from shame over what has happened to them?\n\nShould Melinda feel like Hester?

{"text":"Reader's Den\n\nShare the shapes of the city's skyline begin to emerge from the fog, Mrs. Lidcote is full of worry and unable to stop mulling over her past, which she fears will become her daughter Leila's future. When she shares these fears with an old friend, Franklin, whom she meets on the boat, he tells her that times have changed, that Leila won't face the same stigma, and what's more, he proposes to Mrs. Lidcote! She has a lot to think over, and she begins to really wonder if she does have a chance of being accepted again by those who cut her out years ago.\n\nWhy does Franklin try so hard to convince Mrs. Lidcote that she is just being paranoid, and is not a social outcast? Does he really believe times have changed so much, or is he just working towards his own goal of marrying her? Maybe he is trying to convince himself?\n\nFranklin, Leila, and the relative sent to collect her, Susy, all have in common an attitude of gaiety when it comes to Leila's new marriage. They all try to convince Mrs. Lidcote that she is hopelessly old-fashioned and out of touch with the new way of doing things. Mrs. Lidcote starts to second guess herself, until it becomes clear that she is being excluded from Leila's dinner party. Why is everyone working so hard to convince her of something that doesn't seem to be true?\n\nInstead of telling her mother directly that she should not attend her dinner party, Leila insists that she must be too exhausted after her journey to come. Does it seem that everyone is treating Mrs. Lidcote like a child? Why does Leila not think her mother will be able to see that she is being excluded?\n\nBefore she returns to Europe, Franklin comes to Mrs. Lidcote's hotel room to try once more to convince her that she will be accepted in society. Despite what had happened at Leila's home, Mrs. Lidcote suddenly agrees and tells Franklin she wants to go downstairs right then and there to see some old acquaintances. It is only then that Franklin balks, and the truth is made clear: he knows that she is still an outcast. Was Mrs. Lidcote really convinced, or was she trying to test Franklin?\n\nThis story was published in 1911. Does the social world of old New York hold any relevance when you read it today? Is it enjoyable as a look at a bygone era, or do you find parallels with today's society that you relate to?\n\nPlease leave any comments and questions below, and thank you for participating in the Reader's Den! Join us next week when we will discuss Wharton's 1934 story, Roman Fever.\n\nOn one hand, this story has a specific time stamp. It's hard to imagine someone being shunned over any marital transgression that didn't involve a crime, much less being socially ostracized years after the fact for something no longer considered a big deal.\n\nAn aspect that I find more enduring: if you live long enough to have grown children, you have lived through some major changes and plenty of pendulum swings in attitudes about marriage, dating, and family matters in general. Figuring out whether and how the changes apply at every stage of life is an ongoing or recurring job for many.\n\nThanks for commenting, Anne! I think you make a good point; divorce may carry the stigma it once did, but people will always face adjustments and changes in social standards during their lifetimes.\n\nOne thing that I think remains true today is that once a person has judged another person in a certain way, it is difficult to overcome the perception of that person, whether it be positive or negative. Mrs. Lidcote's actions may not have shocked people so much were she her daughter's contemporary, but at this point people have made up their mind about her."}
{"text":"Her Daughter's Dream\n\nHer Daughter's Dream - Discussion Guide\n\nDiscussion Guide\n\n1. Both Hildie and Trip miss some obvious signs that something traumatic has happened to Carolyn. What are they? Later, in chapter 4, when Hildie and Trip argue about Hildie's going back to work, Trip says, \"A little girl shouldn't be alone so much. Things could happen.\" Discuss the irony in that statement. What is it about their family dynamics that makes Carolyn vulnerable to a predator like Dock?\n\n2. Do you think Hildie's character changes from book 1 to 2? If so, how does she change and why? Did you like her more or less in this book?\n\n3. Carolyn runs away\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014after getting the news of her brother's tragic death. Is that a realistic response? Why or why not? Have you ever wished you could run away from a painful reality? How did you deal with it? Have you ever been in the place of Carolyn's parents and grandmother\u2014not knowing the whereabouts of someone you love? What was that like? What advice would you give someone who is facing such a situation?\n\n4. When Carolyn meets Mary in Golden Gate Park, Mary says she felt an impulse to make extra sandwiches that morning, even though she had no idea why. Have you ever felt God nudging you to do something you didn't understand? Did you follow through on that impulse? Why or why not?\n\n5. After Carolyn comes home following her two-year disappearance, neither Hildie nor Trip presses her for details about what happened. Do you think that is wise? How does this both help and hurt Carolyn? In your own life, how can you balance being nosy with being concerned for those you love?\n\n6. When Carolyn graduates from college and pays off her debt to her parents, Trip and Hildie give the money back to her. Were you surprised by Trip and Hildie's action? Why or why not? Why is it hard for Carolyn to accept their gift? Have you ever given or received an unexpected, extravagant gift? What was the motivation behind it? What was the response?\n\n7. For many years, Carolyn finds more appealing fellowship and support in AA than she does in the church. Why is that? What does that say about AA? about the church? What finally changes Carolyn's view of Christians? Do you know anyone who has a negative view of the church? What could you say or do to encourage them to give the church another chance? What other influences does God bring into Carolyn's life to show her the truth of His love for her?\n\n8. Near the end of the story, Hildie reflects that God sent Mitch to rescue her, just as he had rescued Carolyn years earlier. In what ways does Mitch \"rescue\" Carolyn? How might her life have been different if she had never married? if she had married someone less understanding and supportive?\n\n9. Marta's choice not to move to Jenner by the Sea with Hildie and Trip seems to finally make the gap between mother and daughter so wide it can't be crossed. Why does Hildie think Marta doesn't want to move in with them? What does Marta really want? Why are they unable to discuss it rationally?\n\n10. In chapter 30, when Dawn and Carolyn go to visit Marta for a week, Marta says that \"making things easier on your children is sometimes the worst thing you can do.\" Do you agree or disagree? How do you see this illustrated in the story? in your own life?\n\n11. How does Marta change over the course of the two books? What changes her the most? In what ways is she still the same?\n\n12. When Dawn confesses to her mother that she slept with Jason, Carolyn's response is gracious and nonjudgmental. How do Carolyn's own experiences play into her response to Dawn? How would you respond to such a confession from your son or daughter? How would you like to respond?\n\n13. How does Dawn's experience of the church after she sleeps with Jason differ from Carolyn's experience after returning from Haight-Ashbury? Why is it different? How does Paster Daniel's gracious response affect Dawn's future and her walk with Christ? Have you ever been in a position to counsel someone who has made a mistake they think cannot be forgiven? What did (or would) you say?\n\n14. Near the end of the story, Dawn makes an important decision that affects the life of her unborn child. How might her struggle with miscarriage and infertility have affected her decision? What would you have done in Dawn's place? Discuss her choice not to talk about it with either her husband or her family. Was that the right way to handle it? Why or why not? How do you think Jason felt when he learned what had happened?\n\n15. In chapter 55, Dawn reads this excerpt from Marta's journal: \"We try to do a little better than the previous generation and find out in the end we've made the same mistakes without intending.\" How do you see this illustrated in the story? How have you seen negative behaviors easily turn into a habit in your own life, as Hildie mentions in chapter 56?\n\n16. When the three generations (Hildemara, Carolyn, and May Flower Dawn) finally sit down to talk, they discuss many of their \"family secrets.\" Discuss the revelations and the effect of finally getting them out into the open. Are you satisfied with what they talk about and how it goes? In what way do you wish it had been handled differently? Are the responses realistic and\/or what you expected?\n\n17. At one point, Marta tells Dawn that people either weigh you down or give you wings. How do some of the characters in this saga give people wings? What can you do in your own relationships to give those you love wings instead of weighing them down?\n\n18. While Scripture makes it clear that children are not held responsible for their parents' sins (see Ezekiel 18:20), it's also true that destructive patterns tend to continue in families and have a negative impact on successive generations (see Exodus 20:5). Over the span of these two novels, what relationship patterns are repeated between mothers and daughters? between grandmothers and granddaughters? In what ways are the patterns finally broken? Is the resolution realistic? What relationship patterns\u2014either negative or positive\u2014have occurred in your family? If the patterns are negative, what have you done or what could you do to break them?\n\n19. Are there secrets in your family\u2014either from generations past or from the present? To whom would you like to talk about these secrets? What kind of response do you think you would get? What response would you hope for?\n\n20. This novel contains many relationships, conversations, rifts, and moments of reconciliation. Take a few minutes to list some of your favorite scenes and tell why you were especially touched or challenged by them."}

{"text":"THE READING \/ TAPESCRIPT\n\nAung San Suu Kyi has been a figurehead for her country's struggle for democracy since 1988. She was born to lead her nation; her father was Burma's independence hero. He was assassinated when she was just two years old. Suu Kyi had an international upbringing. She was educated in Burma, India, and the United Kingdom, where she got her PhD.\n\nIn 1988 she returned home to care for her dying mother. Burma was in political chaos after a new military junta took power. A nationwide uprising against the Generals started and Suu Kyi campaigned for freedom and democracy. The brutal regime clamped down on the people and slaughtered 10,000 demonstrators. This made Suu Kyi more determined to help her people.\n\nSuu Kyi increased her efforts to fight the dictators who were leading her country. She was put under house arrest. Even though the government arrested her, the party she led won a staggering 82% of the seats in the 1990 election. The regime never recognized the results. The Generals offered her freedom if she left the country, but she refused.\n\nSuu Kyi was under house arrest for the best part of two decades. Ms Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize while being detained. She was given her freedom by the military dictatorship on November 13th, 2010. She was greeted by thousands of adoring Burmese at the gates of her home. World leaders welcomed her release.

{"text":"1. What ultimately caused Debra to find her \"clout\" and helped her to change her life?\n\n2. How did Debra's mother, and even grandmothers, help and hurt Debra's chances for a successful life? In what ways is Debra like and unlike them? What learned or inherited mothering skills\u2014good and bad\u2014helped make Debra into the mother she became?\n\n3. How did Debra's father influence her choices in male partners? She says, with regard to self-esteem: \"just because you know you don't have enough doesn't mean you get some.\" It seems clear that she knows all along that she should avoid unstable men but doesn't. Why? In the end, when she makes a better choice for a life partner, why has her judgment improved?\n\n4. How did Debra come to terms with the \"race\" issue she and Marie constantly faced in small town Texas? She says she never saw her motherhood as political, \"but it has its political moments, and I can't back down.\" Should she have been more activist? Why or why not?\n\n5. Strangers comment on the fact that Debra has no extended family. Who plays the role of extended family for Debra? Also, Debra regrets chances not taken to mend her relationship with her own mother and, at the end, worries if she's repeating this mistake with her father. What determines how much contact we have with our family of origin?\n\n6. Debra seems to see this adoption as her last great chance to enter the ranks of the \"normal.\" Is she na\u00efve about this? Does she ignore the possibility that the way she sets out to make a home and family, and where, will increase her isolation? How does the ending speak to her sense of identity? Has she made peace with this longing for normalcy?\n\n7. How do Debra's travails with Marie's hair teach her about an unfamiliar culture and, consequently, about herself? Why does Marie's hair care seem so symbolic to Debra?\n\n8.

How did her interactions with each group help or hinder her growth toward greater strength and stability?\n\n9. Debra is both a single mother and a mother in an interracial family. Which circumstance seems most challenging?\n\n10. How much does the sense of place inform this book?

The book uses a quote from Iris Murdoch as an epigraph: \"Emotions really exist at the bottom of the personality or at the top. In the middle they are acted.\" This quote suggests that we make compromises as we try to be true to ourselves and yet also belong to a community. To be true to ourselves can feel right but isolating. Living in communities can feel cozy, but it requires white lies and self-effacement, too. What does the book say about finding the balance between living alone and living with others? How do we find this balance?\n\n12. Debra's aunt says at the end of the first chapter, \"The meaning of life is children and old people. And death.\" Has Debra discovered this meaning for herself by the end of the book?

For Wednesday, come to class prepared to lead a discussion on the question you have chosen and also bring the beginning of a rough draft. The final essay will be on the order of two pages in length (1.5 spacing, 10 font.)\n\nThe British Hunter, Robert Wilson, respects neither one of the Macombers, whom he is guiding on safari. Summarize his attitude toward each of them. Does he have more contempt for one or the other? Do you agree with Wilson's assessment of them? If so, why? What, on the other hand, is your assessment of Wilson, both for the attitude he has toward them and the way he treats them?\n\nIn your reading of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\", is Robert Wilson a teacher or tyrant, a hero or bully \u2013 or is he a bit of each? Does he take advantage of a weaker man? Or is his cruelty calculated to redeem Macomber' life in some way? We know how things end for Francis. How do they end for Margot?\n\nWe've noted the themes of manliness and nature in Hemingway's stories. The first theme involves a code of behavior emphasizing stoicism, courage and, in his famous phrase, \"grace under pressure.\" The second stresses the curative, purifying, redemptive powers of the natural world as opposed to the lack of honor, moral shallowness and corruption of so-called civilization. How do these themes play out in \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber?\n\nWhy is the life of the story's title character described both as \"short\" and \"happy?\" What is \"happy\" about the life that ends on the last page? What philosophy about the meaning of life does Hemingway mean to convey by the situation he describes in this story? Are the values he ascribes to Robert Wilson meant to be taken by the reader as admirable? What are the moral issues Hemingway raises in this story?"}

In my mind I was reading the book for some reason with the thought that some of it was real. He wrote it so well that I almost mistook it for being real. I mean the Vietnam war was real so maybe thats why I thought so. But either way it didn't necessarily change my view. After figuring that out I realized, isn't that what O'Brien's interpretation of a true war story is? So I read on like I would read any other book. As I read the book I looked instead for the deeper meaning of the story. And it made me wonder, which parts of the story were true? Now im curious to know which parts of the story are from his own life.\n\nAfter reading this novel, I have been surprised by the amount that I was able to connect with it, despite knowing that much of it was fictional during my reading. Therefore, when I read this final caption, I was not overly surprised. In the end, I feel that whether the story was true to actual events or not, it expressed a very meaningful theme that has seemed to really stick to me. In an earlier entry, I commented that the small \"happening truths\" made the story even more real to me. Now, I realize that these small truths still exist, but in the form of morals and lessons that I can choose to carry on with in my life. For this, I can do nothing more but appreciate O'Brien's storytelling ability that much more."}

{"text":"The Color of Water: Summary of Chapter 2-5\n\nSummary of Chapter 2: The Bicycle\n\nThe memoir switches to James's point of view. When he was fourteen, and his stepfather Hunter Jordan died, the only father he had known, his mother mourned in a strange way. She took up the piano and began riding a bicycle all over the black neighborhood since she couldn't drive. They lived in St. Albans in Queens, New York, and the half-black young James is embarrassed by having a white mother who rides the bike in a conspicuous way against traffic. His stepfather had married his mother when she was a widow with eight black children. Hunter had mixed Indian and black blood and gave his mother four more children. He was the only \"Daddy\" James had known, since his own father died when his mother was pregnant with him. At fourteen, James drops out of school, takes drugs, and begins to live a street life, snatching purses. The older children are all in college or graduate school, which his mother had forced \"through sheer will power,\" (p. 7) since there was no money.\n\nJames recalls he always thought his mother strange. She did not look like her children, she did not socialize, and she could speak Yiddish. She ruled her twelve children with an iron fist and would never discuss issues of race. As a younger kid, James was at the mercy of the older siblings. There was never enough of food, clothes, musical instruments, or books to go around, so they shared everything. When James asks his mother questions about race or her background, she would avoid the topic and say, \"Educate your mind . . . Forget everything else\" (p. 13). James describes his siblings as \"ragged with wild hairdos\" (p. 14).\n\nCommentary on Chapter 2: The Bicycle\n\nThe memoir skillfully switches voices between Ruth and James throughout the book, establishing a rhythm of unfolding a fuller picture of the family and their challenges. The narrative is largely chronological but focuses on highlights or moments, such as this one when Hunter Jordan dies. Both Ruth and her son James fall apart when Hunter is gone. James takes to the street without a father figure to help him, and Ruth is lost, with a second husband gone and still five children at home to raise by herself. James begins to give us flashes of how it was to grow up in such a large and poor family that rarely had an adult around to monitor it. His mother had to work nights, and his stepfather only came home on weekends.\n\nBesides the poverty, James always had a difficult time with the question of race, who his mother was, and who he was. His part of the narrative shows the puzzling questions of a mixed race child. The mother's narrative sheds light on his questions, but was only shared much later with him when he became an adult journalist investigating his family's past. James's chapters establish his need to understand his mother's side of the family, and Ruth's narrative brings out why she was reluctant to share this information. Her memoir is honest, direct, and demonstrates her great intelligence, courage, and independence in daring to enter a mixed marriage in the 1940s.\n\nSummary of Chapter 3: Kosher\n\nRuth recounts that her mother's family had the class and money in Poland. Her father was cruder and had lower class manners, though he was respected as a rabbi. He married his mother as a ticket into America. Her mother's eldest sister and husband sponsored them to come to New York. She was two and her brother, Sam, was four when they arrived in America. Their father threatened to send them all back to Europe whenever he was mad. Her mother was terrified of the Tsar and the Kaiser and told about the cold-blooded mass killings in Polish villages.\n\nThey lived with her grandparents in Manhattan when they first arrived. Her grandparents were warm and loving, the only family members who were. They were Orthodox Jews and ate kosher, which were strict rules for eating certain foods on separate sets of dishes. There were many rules for Sabbath. Ruth could never bear sitting still. She liked to run and move. A child was not allowed to ask questions. When her grandfather died, she felt great claustrophobia about the burial rites but was not allowed to say the word, \"death,\" and she never understood it.\n\nCommentary on Chapter 3: Kosher\n\nRuth gives a strong feeling for the claustrophobic life in her family, though her grandparents were warm and loving. She remembers only arbitrary rules and not being able to ask questions. Death is frightening to her because of the rituals and finality of burial. Her grandfather looks asleep, not dead, and she feels they are burying him too soon. She never gets over the shock of death, having major breakdowns with her mother's death, and the death of her two husbands. James describes her teetering on the edge of sanity when someone close to her dies, but she just manages to bring herself back.\n\nRuth has a surprisingly detailed memory of Jewish customs, even though it happened to her fifty years ago by the time she recalls it for her son. This gives an understanding of the power of her heritage and the power it still has over her, despite her suppression of her Jewish memories. With her family performing a kaddish or ceremony for the dead for her while she was still alive, she feels the fear of premature burial, as she did with her grandfather. The desire for life explains her drive to escape a restrictive background at the young age of eighteen.\n\nSummary of Chapter 4: Black Power\n\nJames tells how his mother avoided explaining who she was as they were growing up. When he asked where she was from, she would say, \"God made me . . . I'm light-skinned\" (p. 21). He only got a few tidbits from older siblings. The children teased each other about their background. A brother told James he was adopted, and he went into a panic. His mother did not look like the children with their brown skin. His mother would comfort him that she was truly his mother, but he retains \"an ache\" (p. 23) inside him about his mixed race, and he does not know what it is.\n\nIn 1966, when he was nine, the subject of Black Power was a hot topic. Malcolm X, the militant black leader, had just been killed, and James's siblings could discuss nothing else. James is confused, because Black Power seems threatening to his white mother. His mother will not discuss politics. She has created her own world with her children: \"She insisted on absolute privacy, excellent school grades, and trusted no outsiders of either race\" (p. 27). She works the swing shift as a typist at Chase Manhattan Bank, and her only goal is to get her children educated and to church. James's parents believed that education was the way out of poverty. While Ruth trusts blacks more than whites, she tries to save her children from conflict. She sets the example by ignoring insults when she appears with her black children in public. While James worries for his white mother's safety, she herself is fearless and determined, even after getting mugged. James once hits another black kid who brags that his father is a Black Panther, thinking he is defending Mommy.\n\nCommentary on Chapter 4: Black Power\n\nJames presents a graphic picture of how confusing it was to be of mixed blood during the civil rights movement. While some of his older brothers and sisters take part in the demonstrations, he only thinks of protecting his white Mommy. He cannot understand why she is white, and she will not explain it to him, so he is always left with an ache that he cannot fix. His mother defends Malcolm X and civil rights, but she does not want her children to focus on race. She wants them to educate their minds as a way of knowing who they are.\n\nSummary of Chapter 5: The Old Testament\n\nRuth explains in her voice her father's role as a traveling rabbi in America. He would get contracts from synagogues, but since he was paid little, the family depended on charity and handouts to get by. They moved a lot. His father was not a good rabbi. She was ashamed of her mother being crippled by polio, but she explains that love was not natural to her until she became a Christian.\n\nEventually, the family ended up in Suffolk, Virginia in 1929. They were not accepted there, because they were Jews. The children called her names. When her father could make no money as a rabbi, he opened a store that sold mostly to black people, which increased the town's prejudice against them. Ruth's \"Mameh\" was a good wife and kept the religious tradition, but her family in New York ignored her, and so did her husband. The father makes everyone work hard in the store, and there was no family love. She describes her terror of her father, who sexually abused her.\n\nShe defends her choice of a black husband, saying that James's father, Dennis, \"taught me about a God who lifted me up and forgave me and made me new. I was lucky to meet him or I would've been a prostitute or dead\" (p. 43). She says the Jews were still waiting for the Messiah. She describes Passover customs.\n\nCommentary on Chapter 5: The Old Testament\n\nRuth tries to explain how she could forsake her own religious tradition for Christianity. The chapter title contrasts with the next chapter title, suggesting the harshness of Old Testament law and the New Testament law of forgiveness. Ruth's family thinks she has made a choice to lower herself and the family by marrying a black man, but what she tells us of Dennis shows his great kindness and humanity in contrast to her own family's cruelty. In her family, only her mother and grandparents show Ruth any love or understanding. Her father does everything to squash the life out of his family, using them for his own purposes. All the children run off as soon as they can, and the poor mother dies an early and sad death. The harshness and strict rules of her Jewish life are constantly seen in light of the liberation she feels in finding a loving and forgiving God. Dennis exemplifies Christianity to Ruth, for his kindness to everyone. Love is more important to her than skin color or customs"}

Wouldn't the words, \"dying rich uncle who wishes to make you his heir\" mean anything to her?\n\n] I must have a different edition, couldnt find those, but I have other issues...which complicate this scene\n\n] ] My only guess is she was in such shock, she couldn't think straight.\n\n]\n\n] This is a puzzlement for me, but for many reasons... ] Jane herself started this whole pickle by writing to the uncle in the first place. Remember, Jane had this info from just before Aunt Reed died. Why did she not write from Gatehead, she was there three weeks after the funeral! It was then she learned about the money! Why did she wait until she got back to Thornfield? Or why she didn't renew the correspondence at Moor House. Or how Jane's letter got to the islands and Mr Mason got back to England in one month. Or why the heck didn't Mr Briggs have further details of the \"competency\" mentioned in Uncle's letter from three years ago.\n\n] Poor little Jane was in such a shock, she could not think straight. Yes, yet throughout the book she is such a strong character, and has such a clear head. Why did she not go find Messrs Briggs and Mason until this was all straigntened out? These guys just left her, in Thornfield, alone in a swoon? They couldn't wait to leave. Would not gentlemanlike behavior had dictated at least an offer of assistance from one of them? errr!! Why did they just leave her like that? ] :-)\n\n] ]\n\nThose exact words all together are not in the book. But the letter she got from Aunt Reed lets her know he was rich and wanted to make her his heir. A lawyer showing up at the wedding implies that her uncle hadn't made it to the poor house yet. And Mr. Briggs and Mr. Mason conveyed the dying part. Jane, who is one smart cookie, should have put two and two together.\n\nAnd you are so right about them not doing anything. Talk about letting the ball drop! It's inexcusable. Jane could have the guy's license!!\n\nI am afraid that the only answer to all this is that the author is Charlotte Bronte, not Jane Austen. The protaganists in a romance novel must SUFFER before they can be happy. Little details like what we have been discussing just get in the way of their ennobling ordeal. Therefore they are unimportant and can safely be ignored."}

{"text":"Also consider these LitLovers talking points to help get a discussion started for 11\/22\/63:\n\n1. How would you describe Jake\u2014what kind of man is he? Why does Jake agree to go back in time? At this stage in your own life, would you be willing to travel back to the past? What conditions would you require to do so?\n\n2. What does Jake's first stop in Derry, Maryland, have to do with Dallas, Texas? Why does King inject this subplot into the main plot? What is the point he wants to make regarding the events in Derry? Is Derry necessary to the plot\u2014or does it drag down the novel's pace?\n\n3. Describe the kind of world that Jake of 2011 finds himself in when he arrives in 1958? What changes have 50 years made in our culture? What has not changed? Do you...would you...prefer to live in one era over the other? If you were alive during the 50s and 60s, what do you recall of your life and world events? Are you ever nostalgic?\n\n4. Once in Texas, what does Jake, now George Amberson, come to learn about Lee Harvey Oswald as a human being? What kind of character is Oswald? How would you describe him?\n\n5. When Oswald arrives on the scene, why doesn't Amberson just take him out? Why does he delay?\n\n6. Follow-up to Question 5: Who is de Mohrenschildt and what is his connection to Oswald?\n\n7. Follow-up to Questions 5 & 6: What makes George (and the author) conclude that Oswald acted alone? What do you think? Have you done any prior reading that would make you agree or disagree that Oswald as the lone gunman?\n\n8. Amberson has come to believe that life is not random:\n\nCoincidences happen, but I've come to believe they are actually quite rare. Something is at work, O.K.? Somewhere in the universe (or behind it), a great machine is ticking and turning its fabulous gears.\n\nWhat does Amberson mean and what makes him believe this? Many believe in an over-arching fate or in God who oversees\u2014and intervenes in\u2014our lives. People often say, \"things happen for a reason.\" Do they? Are coincidences truly rare\u2014is chance a major force in the universe? Or is there a something greater at work? What do you think?\n\n9. Follow-up to Question 8: Discuss this passage from the novel below. What does it mean? Do you agree with the vision of the world it presents, particularly the last sentence?\n\n.... A universe of horror and loss surrounding a single lighted stage where mortals dance in defiance of the dark.\n\n10. Follow-up to Questions 8, 9 & even 2: Talk about harmonics, echoes, and the butterfly effect. What are they? How do they play out in this book? What do they suggest about the danger of tampering with the past?\n\n11. Do the events in the novel\u2014transporting Jake from 2011 to 1958, moving him from Maine to Texas, and putting him near the Oswalds\u2014seem at all plausible? Is King able to construct his plot in such a way that it makes sense? Or is the entire construct too preposterous to be enjoyable or taken seriously as literature?\n\n12. How does King handle the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis? Do you find his treatment of it suspenseful? Or because you know the outcome, is recapping the event dull and uneventful?\n\n13. King paints a dire portrait of the world at large in the 50s and 60s\u2014the geopolitics and existential dread of nuclear war. He's a horror writer, after all. Yet in many ways, the centerpiece of the novel is George's relationship with Sadie\u2014the detail of their small, beautiful romance. Why would King choose to juxtapose the grand scale with the quotidian of everyday life\u2014and an intimate love story at that?\n\n14. Why does Sadie sense that there's something odd about George? What are some of the ways that George's knowledge of the future betray him?\n\n15. Follow-up to Question 14: Why doesn't George tell Sadie who he is? How would you handle such information if you were told that the person you loved came from the future?\n\n16. What about George's sports betting? Is it a fair way to make a living? It's certainly not honest, but then again...why not? Has Jake's moral compass shifted somehow, now that he's George Amberson?\n\n17. Discuss the Yellow Card Man. What is the symbolic significance?\n\n18. How would you classify this book\u2014Historical fiction? Science fiction? Alternate history? Romance? Thriller? Is it a suspenseful read\u2014did you find yourself rushing to turn the page? Were you expecting George to succeed\u2014or fail\u2014in his mission?\n\n19. Talk about George's decision to return to 2011. Do you wish he had made a different choice? What about Sadie?\n\n20. When Jake returns to the present, in what way are things different? Is the world a better place? What does the novel suggest about the ability to change events...and thus change the course of history\u2014a good thing or dangerous thing?\n\n21. If you've read other Stephen King books, or seen the movies, how does this book compare with his others? Has he jumped his usual genre...or expanded it? Does that fact that King's normal genre is fantasy-horror make him especially equipped as an author to write a book like 11\/22\/63?\n\n(Questions issued by LitLovers.

{"text":"Harry & Tonto: DISCUSSION QUESTIONS\n\nWhat is the function of the first sequence of the film? (scenes 1-5). In other words, how do those scenes provide a context for what follows in the film?\n\nThroughout the film there are numerous allusions to Shakespeare's King Lear. In that play the king steps down from his throne and resolves to divide his kingdom into three parts\u2014one for each of his daughters. Two of the daughters declare (falsely) their love and respect of the old man. But the third refuses to make a grand expression of her love for him\u2014and he angrily banishes her. He suffers through time spent with each of the first two daughters. Lear, forlorn and hopeless, wanders the heath and rages against the storm. His third daughter, Cordelia, raises an army and invades England\u2014is briefly reunited with her father (and is reconciled to him), and then Cordelia is hanged in prison and Lear, broken-hearted, dies soon afterward. What resonance to the story of King Lear do you see in the story of Harry Coombs?\n\nOne critic referred to Harry Coombs as a \"connoisseur of the human condition.\" What evidence of that characterization do you see in the film?\n\nCan you remember times when Harry lost his temper in the film? What did these scenes reveal about his character?\n\nWhy was Harry's having a cat for a pet, instead of a dog for a pet, a perfect complement to his character?\n\nIn scene 27 Harry is reunited with an old flame, Jesse Stone. What did Harry gain from this interaction? In what way did it close a circle in his life? What did the hitchhiker Ginger gain from watching their interaction?\n\nSeveral times in the film Harry reminisces about his late wife, Annie. How do these scenes provide insight into his character and values? Why don't we see him talking about his late wife with the people he encounters?\n\nThere are really two basic scenes in the film beginning with sequence two: scenes where Harry is visiting with his three children and scenes of Harry on the road (to Chicago, and later, to Los Angeles). How do these scenes play off one against the other? What is being resolved in each set of scenes?\n\nThere are two prominent deaths portrayed in the film. What is their function in the film?\n\nDid you detect any pattern in Harry's interactions with authority figures in the film? For example: the police trying to evict him, the woman at the morgue (scene 14), the airport security folks (scene 16), and the greyhound bus driver (scene 19).\n\nHere are the main players in Harry's life in the film.

{"text":"Study Tools\n\nJohnny Got His Gun\n\nDalton Trumbo\n\nChapters ix\u2013x\n\nChapters xiii\u2013xiv\n\nSummary\n\nChapter xi\n\nJoe exercises his brain with multiplication series, grammatical cases, and as much as he can remember of the narratives of Dickens's David Copperfield and A Christmas Carol and Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans and other Leatherstocking Tales. Joe then tries to remember \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" by Tennyson and \"When the Frost is on the Pumpkin\" by Riley. Joe runs through the planets, the Ten Commandments, and assorted psalms. Joe regrets how little he memorized of all of these things because now he cannot use them to entertain himself for long stretches of time.\n\nJoe decides to start at the beginning with an idea and somehow teach himself something new. He decides to start with an idea that relates to telling time. He realizes he cannot calculate the time between the day in September 1918 when he was hit with a shell and the day he awoke and discovered he was deaf. But the idea of counting time has been in his head for a while. Joe's first thought is to track the seconds, minutes, and hours between each nurse's visit until he gets to twenty-four hours, so he would know what schedule the nurses kept. But Joe cannot concentrate long enough to count the seconds correctly. He realizes that this method is too complicated, so he decides to focus on simpler schedules like how often his bowel movements and bed changes occur in nurse's visits.\n\nEventually, Joe realizes that he can sense the outside world with his skin and decides that he should attempt to feel the sunrise. He reasons that the nurse probably bathes him in the mornings, as nurses do their heavy work in the morning. He calculates that the nurse probably visits him roughly every two hours, so he decides to count up to her last visit before dawn and then prepare himself to feel the change in temperature that accompanies sunrise. Joe executes his plan and triumphantly feels the warmth on his neck. Joe feels a part of the world, as dawn is happening to many others at the same time. Joe imagines himself watching dawn move over his old town and the mountains of Colorado. He feels grateful for the gift of time.\n\nChapter xii\n\nJoe celebrates his New Year's Eve exactly one year after he manages to keep time. He remembers various New Year's images from his life in Colorado and Los Angeles. Keeping time has become easier for Joe as he has became accustomed to the nurses' schedules and has learned to tell the nurses apart from the diffrent vibrations they make. Joe likes his regular nurse\u2014the day nurse\u2014and guesses that she is middle-aged, heavier, and used to her work, as she does it briskly. Joe can tell when a new nurse comes on duty because he can feel her take off his sheet, look at him for the first time, and then cry or even leave the room to be sick. All these observations help Joe organize his new universe. Now that he can keep time, he makes sure to imagine himself taking a walk in the woods outside Paris on every Sunday afternoon.\n\nJoe thinks of Kareen, as he left her when she was nineteen. Thinking of her is the only time he becomes homesick and wishes he were in an American hospital. Joe knows that he cannot even be identified as an American. Joe decides that he is probably among Englishmen, as he was stationed next to a regiment of \"Limeys\" when he was hit.\n\nJoe remembers the strangeness of the Englishmen, especially one Scottish man who refused to fight the Germans once he learned that there were Bavarians fighting with them (Scotland had a connection to Bavaria through Crown Prince Rupert of the Stuart line). To Joe's surprise, the Englishmen did not shoot the Scotchman; instead, they merely transferred him to another location where there were no Bavarians fighting.\n\nJoe remembers a day when the Englishmen glimpsed a German soldier stumbling blindly out in the open and decided to shoot at him. The soldier was killed, but he remained hanging on the barbed wire not far from the English regiment's trenches. The dead German began to smell, so an English corporal passing through the area ordered the regiment's leader, Corporal Timlon, to bury the German. Timlon did bury the German, but then the area was shelled and the buried German resurfaced, hanging on the barbed wire again.\n\nAt this point, the Englishmen named the German man \"Lazarus.\" The colonel came back through and ordered Lazarus buried again, this time with a full Church of England funeral service said over the body. Corporal Timlon obeyed and was shot in the rear end while reading the service. Several days later, however, the German body resurfaced again after shelling, and the Englishmen opened fire on the body. Shortly afterward, a young subaltern assigned to the English regiment snuck out on his first night patrol and stumbled into the body of Lazarus. The young Englishman went permanently mad and was sent to a mental hospital. Joe imagines swapping minds with the young Englishman, who is probably no longer using his healthy body.\n\nAnalysis\n\nJohnny Got His Gun continues to be paced peculiarly. An undefined amount of time passes between Chapter x and Chapter xi, while one year passes between Chapter xi and Chapter xii; the chapters themselves proceed at pace. In Book I, we see Joe struggle to keep his sanity and to assert his consciousness against the onslaught of memories. Joe learns to recognize that he is remembering memories, not reliving them, and he learns to recognize the difference between sleeping and waking hours. The establishment of these mental boundaries allows Joe to feel like a conscious, thinking being again. Book II charts Joe's progress as a conscious, thinking being as he tries to organize his mental world.\n\nThe shift from a preoccupation the past to a focus on the future that happens between Book I and Book II also happens on a smaller scale within Chapter xi. Joe begins the chapter attempting to fill up his mental life with lessons remembered from his youth\u2014mathematics, grammar, literature, religion. But Joe ultimately realizes that he never learned enough to make this mode of preoccupation worthwhile. Instead, he looks forward, deciding to try to teach himself new things. He works first on the project of telling time. Instead of trying to fill up the empty space of his time, he works to divide that time up into measurable segments.\n\nIn Chapter xii, Joe's internal world begins to come alive with details from the external world. He has also gained greater control over his memories. Instead of letting them wash over him while he is in a semiconscious state, Joe measures them out, using them to fill time, as with his repeated Sunday afternoon walks in the woods outside of Paris. Sometimes, he uses his memories to rehearse a story line, as with the memory of Lazarus.\n\nThe story about Lazarus begins as a tale of how different Joe considers the English to be, but it ends with Joe declaring solidarity with the young English subaltern: \"wherever you are we have lots in common we are brothers.\" The Lazarus story again raises the idea of the decay and disgustingness encountered during war\u2014a theme also touched on by Joe's rat story and dream in Chapter vii. The subaltern and Joe are not \"brothers\" because they were fighting together against the Germans, rather because they are both victims of the overwhelming bodily horrors of war. In fact, the Lazarus story emphasizes the fact that solidarity does not necessarily fall along battle lines: the Scotsman feels more solidarity with the Bavarians against whom he is fighting than with the English with whom he was fighting. Joe's story stresses the foreignness of the English regiment while creating sympathy for the wandering German, who is arbitrarily shot down and becomes \"Lazarus.\" Solidarity in battle is not created by recognition of allies and enemies, but instead by mutual experience and recognition of the bodily horrors of war."}

{"text":"4. Synopsis and Activities: Act Two\n\nThe scene opens in the studio and dominating the space is a large image of both Australian and British women bowing to the Japanese. This huge image remains throughout most of the scene and the audience cannot escape its meaning. Both Bridie and Sheila are present and Bridie is off to one side singing the Captive's 'Hymn' (with the women's choir). Sheila is speaking to the camera and her answers to the questions are juxtaposed with Bridie's singing. In this interview we learn about the situation in Belalau and the Japanese order that had been issued to kill every prisoner of war.\n\nBridie's illness and the way in which Sheila looked after her is made public\u2014but Sheila baulks at telling the whole truth about how she acquired the drugs to save her, making up the story of the shoe-horn saving her. This information is picked up by the interviewer as if it is highly significant. The scene ends with the story of Curtin's message: 'Keep smiling, girls'. The horror of this command is emphasised by the image of Curtin and the prisoners and the Judy Garland song.\n\nStudent activities\n\n27. Make notes on the factual information that is revealed about the war.\n\n28. Make notes on the way that Sheila has responded to the events of the war. Examine the ways in which she uses language in this scene to both reveal and hide her feelings.\n\n29. Make notes on the ideas or issues that are highlighted by the dramatic form of this scene.\n\nScene Ten\n\nThe transition to this scene holds the image of emaciated male prisoners in view as we move into a space that is neither hotel room nor studio although both characters are still wearing body microphones. Sheila has not gone to lunch and is sitting doing some kind of tapestry\u2014an image of stitching things together. Bridie comments on the photograph of the soldiers\u2014a comment that stimulates a riposte from Sheila about the role of the government in suppressing information about the women's role in the war. This interaction between the on-stage action and the projected visual images connects past and present.\n\nTheir conversation reveals the tension that is now out in the open. Recriminations flow as Bridie tries to make sense of what she has learned and Sheila tries to defend her actions, not only with the Japanese but also in leaving Bridie after the war. The intercutting of Rick's voice into their altercation leaves them not knowing how much he has heard. The juxtaposition of the song 'I'll Walk Alone' suggests the isolation of each of these victims of this dreadful situation.\n\nStudent activities\n\n30.

The recitation of the words of each of the postcards leads the women back into their memories. The moments of darkness highlight the pain of these experiences.\n\nIn this scene the image of the sonata becomes significant as the women trawl back through their memories together. In this scene, one of the most important issues of the play is highlighted\u2014the complete lack of acknowledgement by the Australian government juxtaposed with the pitifully small amount of compensation paid by the Japanese government to these victims of the power play of these sovereign states.\n\nStudent activities\n\n33.

Make notes on the ideas or issues that are highlighted by the dramatic form of this scene.\n\nScene Twelve\n\nThis scene takes place in the motel room. Bridie is attempting to re-establish their relationship despite the obvious tensions between them. It is in this scene that we learn of Bridie's 'crime' in the David Jones' food hall. We now understand how she feels and why she reacted in this way. Sheila's reaction to this confession allows us to see how deeply scarred these women have been by their experiences\u2014not only by the Japanese, but also by the responses and inaction of their own countries. Sheila's realisation is that it is important not only for themselves but for the thousands of others similarly afflicted to tell these stories in public. Bridie is not yet convinced and the tension between them arises again. We are now aware that this tension is about the present, the past, memories, recollections, reconstructions, truth, shame and guilt. The moment of darkness returns, followed by images of 'great men' of history and the song, 'Whispering Grass'.\n\nStudent activities\n\n36. Make notes on the factual information that is revealed about the war.\n\n37. Make notes on the ideas about truth and lies that are revealed in this scene.\n\n38. Make notes on the ideas or issues that are highlighted by the dramatic form of this scene.\n\nScene Thirteen\n\nThis scene cuts straight into the interview as both Bridie and Sheila recount their experiences as the war draws to an end. We hear about the diaries and the burning of these by the British. This is overlaid with images ofHiroshimaand the news of the death ofPearlafter the war had officially ended. There is a sense of calm as both women recount these events, although at one significant moment Sheila's composure cracks. It is at this point that we see the symbiotic relationship that the women had previously enjoyed. As Bridie finishes recounting the anecdote that Sheila had begun they join hands and relive, together, that moment of memory and reconciliation. The playing of the 'Blue Danube Waltz' is a counterpoint to their memories. Dancing becomes associated with life and joy and hope and survival, and this is juxtaposed with the Japanese atrocities in Belalau and the visual images of the celebrations of the end of the war.\n\nThe scene reaches a climax as the confessions of the two women are made public. This is the moment of truth as Bridie tells about Sheila's personal sacrifice and Sheila tells of Bridie's theft from David Jones. The simplicity of these truths juxtaposed with the official 'lies' of the government ring out with a clarity and candour that is underlined by the gradual darkness that follows the revelation. This scene ends with the sounds of the hymn 'An Epitaph to War', images of the women recuperating and the huge projected image of the army nurses arriving in\nSingapore.\n\nStudent Activities\n\n39.

The two colleagues and friends are now reunited and this is contained in the image of the lifting of the suitcase. While most of the tension has been released there is still some unresolved business to be dealt with. Sheila holds out the shoe-horn, now the symbol not only of their reunion, but also of their reconciliation. The two women embrace. The play ends with them women dancing to the 'Blue Danube' and in the slowly darkening space the final spotlight falls on the shoe-horn.\n\nStudent activities\n\n42.

In what ways do they try to escape? In what ways do they allow themselves to remain?\n\nConsider the role played by love in \"A Doll's House.\" Nora protests that she got the loan from Krogstad out of love for her husband and family and that she forged her father's signature on her IOU to Krogstad out of a loving desire to not trouble her dying father. Are these really acts of love, or is she merely claiming to love out of a desire to justify...\n(read more)"}
{"text":"They knew they would spend the rest of their lives together, but they didn't know when one of them would decide to end the long distance relationship and move in with the other one. Moving away from their respective city would mean leaving behind all their friends and family and even their jobs. They would end up having to start a completely new life. So sad.\n\nA typical gold digger. A lot of women like to chase after rich men in hopes of obtaining money from them and having the men buy them whatever they want. They also like to marry that man and eventually divorce the man so they leave with half their money. Remember If you ain't no punk, holla \"We want prenup\".\n\nMurs finds it hard to handle all the hardships and all the terrible things that happen in the streets. With all the illegal activities that take place in the streets it makes him want to speak out. Which he does through the use of his music.\n\nDespite growing up as a Baptist which is a form of Christianity. Murs still does Yoga which is not a part of the Christian beliefs. It is a part of the Hindu philosophy instead. This is an example of Murs open mind and how he is willing to try out anything and will believe in what he wants to believe in. He won't be told by somebody else what his beliefs should be.\n\nPreacher and the leader of the choirs are the most highly looked upon in the Church since they are placed in very important positions. Priests don't make a lot of money, so Murs starts to think that the priest is doing something corrupt to get a nice car since his money alone wouldn't be enough to get one. Murs is also concerned over that the leader of the choir doesn't have a wife yet despite his supposed devout faith. So many things in his religion didn't go together. That the people in the highest placed position were going against there religion and doing wrongs. This made Murs start to question his faith.\n\nMurs went his own way when it came to religion and decided for himself what he wanted to believe in, instead of just being told to believe in something. Murs got into following the Nation Of Islam beliefs from The Final Call newspaper.\n\nThe Final Call was a the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam. It was founded by Minister Louis Farrakhan. It reports national and international news. It is also used as a way of communication with the Nation of Islam.\n\nMurs began to question his faith and belief in God. If God was supposed to help him, how come when Murs' life got harder, Murs felt like God wasn't there to help him. Thus causing him to think to question his entire faith as to whether God is real or not.\n\nA reference to very popular moves by one of the most historical boxers and one of the most badass action movie actors ever.\n\nMike Tyson was a professional boxer who is one of the greatest boxers of all time. He is considered to be the last great heavyweight champion and was even dubbed the the \"baddest man on the planet.\" Tyson even bit a part of Evander Holyfield's ear off. His uppercut was his best and most praised punch in his arsenal.\n\nBruce Lee was a martial arts instructor and actor. He is famous for movies such as Way Of The Dragon and Big Boss. However, he was also famous for his extreme physical strength. He could perform pushups with only his thumb and index finger along with being able to do 50 one armed chin ups. Bruce could kick a 300-lb pound bag and make it hit the ceiling. His front kick was one of his more famous and heavily portayed move, especially in movies."}

{"text":"Up Coming Books\n\n1. The story line in this book has an ever-present theme of the relationships between parents and children, especially between a mother and her child. What kind of relationship did you have with your parents as a child? As an adult? Are there any parallels between your own parental relationships and those of the characters?\n\n2. Will is described as having \"strangely dysfunctional relationships with all of the women in his life\" (120). Do you agree with this assessment? By the end of the book, does it seem as if he is improving his relationships with women? How so?\n\n3. There are many different women in this book with different roles in law enforcement. How are their positions similar? How are they different? Do you think it was easier for the younger women to establish their careers in what is still a male dominated line of work?\n\n4. Do you think Will's assumption of Evelyn's involvement in her team's corruption affected the way he pursued her kidnapping? Did Amanda's withholding of information from Will affect the progression of the case?\n\n5. When speaking on the subject of women and minorities trying to make careers in the police force in the 1960's and 1970's, Amanda says, \"Every single day was a struggle to do right when everything around you was wrong\" (119). What do you think she means by this? Do you think her perception of the situation was accurate?\n\n6. When visiting Boyd Spivey in prison, Will reflects on the living situations of the prisoners and how they are de-humanized. He thinks of their living conditions as \"heartbreaking\". When he considers the crimes that landed them in prison, however, he seems to change his mind. Do you agree with Will's sentiments? Should you feel sympathy for the prisoners at all? Or do they deserve the treatment they receive?\n\n7. Before Faith goes off to be questioned by the Atlanta police, Amanda hugs her and says, \"You've got two minutes to pull yourself together. If these men see you cry, all you will be to them for the rest of your career is a useless woman\" (139). Is this judgment accurate in your mind? If Faith were a man in the same situation, would crying elicit the same negative connotation?\n\n8. \"Mystery is good for a relationship,\" Will says to Sara, in a joking manner (186). Do you think there is some truth to that statement? How could this \"mystery\" in both familial and romantic relationships be seen as a theme in the book?\n\n9. A pregnant fourteen year-old is not common these days, though it's not an usual occurrence, either. Back in the early 90s, when Jeremy was born, Faith and her family endured ostracization and alienation. In most areas of the United States today, that would not be the case. Have things changed for the better, or are they worse?\n\n10. When reflecting on the secret that led to her kidnapping and torture, Evelyn thinks the kidnappers would not believe her because, \"The truth was too disappointing. Too common\" (205). What is your opinion of the true motivation behind the crime revealed at the end of the book? Do you think Evelyn is correct in thinking it disappointing and common?\n\n11. The prisoners in the book have remarkable means of communicating both within the prison and with the outside world. Even prisoners like Boyd Spivey and Roger Ling, who should technically have no access to any information outside of their cells, are usually better informed than the GBI investigators visiting them. What, if anything, can and should be done to inhibit outside communication?\n\n12. This novel is told through the viewpoints of several different characters. How does this technique aid the narrative? How does each point of view give the reader insight into the case?\n\nThe Shoemaker's Wife by Adriana Trigiani\nTuesday July 9th, 12:00 p.m.\nBring your lunch. Dessert and lemonade will be provided.\n\n1. The novel is split into three parts: Italian Alps, Manhattan and Minnesota. How would you characterize Ciro and Enza in each of these sections? How do they adapt to their new homes? In what ways did they change over the course of the novel? In what ways did they remain the same?\n\n2. How would the course of both Ciro's and Enza's lives have been different if they hadn't gone to America? Do you think they would have ended up together if they had stayed on the mountain?\n\n3. Enza and Ciro shared their first kiss beside Stella's grave. In what ways did digging the grave open up Ciro's heart?\n\n4. When Ciro opened up his duffle bag on the ship to America, \"the fragrance of the convent laundry\u2014lavender and starch\u2014enveloped him, fresh as the mountain air of Vilminore\" (p. 120). What other aspects of convent life stayed with Ciro and Eduardo after they left? What did they learn from the sisters?\n\n5. Enza \"found a best friend in Laura, but so much more\" (p. 195). What do you think made Laura and Enza's bond so deep from the beginning? In what ways did they support one another?\n\n6. Did anything surprise you about the characterization of Enrico Caruso? How would you describe his relationship with those around him? How did the time he spent with Enza and Laura affect them, even decades later?\n\n7. How does The Shoemaker's Wife portray the immigrant experience? Do any of your own families have a similar immigrant history? Did they have a different experience?\n\n8. Enza and Ciro have different views of religion. In what ways do their beliefs shape their actions and relationship?\n\n9. How do you think Enza's life would have turned out if she had married Vito? If Ciro had married Felicit\u00e1? What did Vito and Felicit\u00e1 offer them and what did they lack?\n\n10. Carlo Lazzari warned Eduardo to \"beware the things of this world that can mean everything or nothing\". In what ways did this advice ring true throughout the novel?\n\n11. What effect did fighting in the Great War have on Ciro? Do you believe he returned to Manhattan a changed man, or did the war just force him to acknowledge what he had known all along?\n\n12. When Ciro saw Enza on the steps of Our Lady of Pompeii church, moments away from marrying Vito, \"it seemed like fate was on his side.\" Do you believe that fate brought Ciro and Enza together on that day? Overall, do you believe that Ciro and Enza were destined to be together?\n\n13. Enza once said to Ciro: \"I remind you, I imagine, of things you'd rather not think about.\" What do you believe Enza meant by this? What challenges did Ciro and Enza face in their relationship? How did they differ in their ways of communicating?\n\n14. How did Ciro, Enza and Antonio each react to Ciro's diagnosis? What were Ciro's fears and hopes for his family? In what ways will Enza and Antonio fulfill his dreams?\n\n15. At the end of the novel, Enza agrees to return to Italy with Antonio and Angela. How do you imagine the reunion between Enza and her family? How will Schilpario be different for Enza when seen through Angela and Antonio's eyes?\n\n1. Did you like Libby as a character? Do you think the author intended for her to be likeable?\n\n2. As the book shifted between points of view, did you find one most appealing, most enlightening, or most reliable?\n\n3. Why has Libby ignored Jim Jeffreys's advice to earn an income for so many years? Do you believe she feels she's earned the money she's been gifted by strangers? What is her attitude toward money?\n\n4. Throughout the book, many characters seem to feel as though life is something that happens to them; others take a more proactive role in steering its course, often with disastrous consequences. Discuss the book's theme of action versus reaction, investigation versus acceptance. Where does Libby's behavior fit in this contrast?\n\n5. Like others Libby meets during her investigation, Barb Eichel seems pleased to have been contacted, having \"wondered if you'd ever get in touch.\" Why did Barb wait for Libby to come to her? Did Barb do enough to remedy the harm she thinks her book has done?\n\n6. As Lyle first brings Libby through the Kill Club gathering, he distinguishes between different types of members\u2014role players and solvers, for instance. Do you consider these to be meaningful differences? How do the various groups make use of the club?\n\n7. In considering the case of the missing girl Lisette Stephens, Libby thinks to herself, \"There was nothing to solve.... She just vanished for no reason anyone could think of, except she was pretty.\" Do you think it's strange that Libby considers this an uninteresting case? What does her attitude toward Lisette say about her view of her own family's murder? Was there something to \"solve\" in the Days' murder?\n\n8. What do you make of Magda, the middle-class Kill Club member so fond of Ben, and so callous to her own son? What does her character tell us, if anything, about the Kill Club and its members?\n\n9. One of the appealing aspects of the Day case (according to Lyle) is the role of children as instigators, victims, and unreliable witnesses. Do you see any similarities among Krissi's accusation, Libby's false eyewitness account, and Lyle's role in the California fires? Were these children to blame for their mistakes? In what ways did they attempt to right the wrongs they caused?\n\n10. \"No one ever forgives me for anything,\" one character says. What role does forgiveness play in Dark Places? Which characters should be more forgiving? Less?\n\n11. What do you think of Diondra's relationships? Why is she attracted to Ben? Why is Trey such a constant companion? Do you think she was romantically involved with Trey?\n\n12. Patty Day frequently worries whether she is a good mother. What do you think? How does the book depict parents in general? Who do you consider the \"good\" and \"bad\" parents in the book?\n\n13. Did you think Ben was guilty? Does the author intend for us to doubt him?\n\n14. Why doesn't Diane return Libby's phone calls? What does she mean at the end of the book when she says, \"I knew you could do it.... I knew you could...try just a little harder\"? Do you like Diane?\n\n15. Why do you think Libby, at the end of the book, thinks twice before shoplifting? Is this reflective of a new attitude toward the world? How?\n\n16. Do you think Ben will find Crystal? What do you imagine their reunion would be like? 17. Why do you think the author chose to set the murders on a farm? What images and themes does the heartland and farming evoke?\n\n18. Libby is a liar, a manipulator, a kleptomaniac, and an opportunist. Does she have any redeeming qualities? Are you able to empathize with her? If so, why?"}

{"text":"The correct answer is D. Because the husband is speaking, and the wife has refused his request to turn around, we can assume that he believes she's deliberately provoking him or infuriating him enough to cause action. Choice E, threaten is obviously too harsh. More than likely, she wouldn't threaten anyone. Choices A and C are not close to the meaning; to coerce means to force someone to do something, and to intimidate means to get someone to do something by fear. He intimidates and coerces her, not vice versa. The only choice that's close is Choice B, hassle. However, because the word tends to have a more light-hearted connotation, Choice D is the better answer.\n\n2. Which of the following is NOT a likely inference based on the information in the passage?\n\nA. Patty from down the road is the wife's best friend.\nB. The husband seems to be truly sorry for what he's done at the end.\nC. The wife sees no way out of the relationship but suicide.\nD. The husband values his job more than his wife.\nE. The housekeeper found the wife in the bathtub.\n\nThe correct answer is A. Here, we're looking for the one phrase that we could NOT infer from the passage. Choice B IS a likely inference; he cries at the end. Choice C IS a likely inference since the wife commits suicide in the story (or the evidence points to that). Choice D IS a likely inference, since the husband ignores the wife's obvious turmoil and goes to his meeting in Chicago instead of staying with her. Plus he assaults her regularly. Choice E IS a likely inference, because the housekeeper reported that the wife had an empty Valium bottle in her hand. Choice A IS NOT a likely inference because a best friend wouldn't be referred to as \"Patty from down the road\". Plus, it seems likely that the wife probably didn't have a best friend at all if suicide seems like the only way out for her.\n\n3. The author most likely includes the information in lines 10 \u2013 14 in order to:\n\nA. compare what happened to the wife recently to the abuse that happened in her childhood.\nB. explain that the husband had a pattern of abuse and probably wouldn't stop any time soon.\nC. demonstrate the wife's weakness.\nD. intensify the scene by describing the wife's injuries in full detail.\nE. critique the wife's willingness to let her husband get away with physical abuse.\n\nThe correct answer is B. Here, we need to look closely at the lines indicated by the question and ask, \"Why did the author write these lines specifically?\" Choice B is the best answer because the lines show how his open hand, his fist and a belt have all administered abuse. If it happened in the past, it will probably continue to happen. Choice A is not correct because although a comparison is made (at least it's not with the belt), it's not comparing any kind of abuse other than domestic violence. Choice C is incorrect because although the wife does appear weak throughout the story, during those lines, she's ironic, offering an almost positive outlook on her abuse. Choices D and E are inaccurate because the wife's injuries aren't described in much detail and no critique of her behavior is made.\n\nA. Her husband takes a flight to Chicago.\nB. Her husband walks into the house.\nC. Her husband runs through the rain.\nD. Her husband slams his fist into the wall.\nE. Her husband purchases roses.\n\nThe correct answer is E. This is simply a matter of remembering the chronology of the story and reading accurately. Which events come after the beginning of the story when the wife is looking out the window? Well, the only thing that could have happened before the wife looks out the window, which is an easier way to tackle the question, is the husband purchasing roses because he walks in with them while she's standing at the window. Hence, everything else must come after.\n\n5. The passage provides information that answers which of the following questions?\n\nI. Does the husband hold a powerful position at work?\nII. What kind of personality traits does the wife display?\nIII. Does the wife's relationships with others in the neighborhood affect her married life?\n\nA. I only\nB. I and II only\nC. I and III only\nD. II and III only\nE. I, II, and III\n\nThe correct answer is B. This is a funny question in that you don't have to actually answer the questions behind the Roman Numerals. Your only goal is to determine whether or not you could answer the questions based on the information given in the text if you needed to. Question I is answerable (he has to fly to Chicago; he has purchased a Mercedes; they employ a housekeeper, etc.). We can reasonably assume that he has a powerful position, so we can answer that question. Question II is answerable (she is meek, forgiving, weak, a sucker for punishment, etc.) We could name a bunch of different personality traits of the wife. Question III, however, is unanswerable because we don't know about any relationships she has with anyone in the neighborhood besides Patty. And that one seems very cursory at best. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice B. The passage provides info to answer questions I and II only."}

{"text":"\"It is so very uncomfortable, not having a carriage of one's own. Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove took me, and we were so crowded! They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr. Musgrove always sits forward. So there was I crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\n\nAt first I took this to mean that Mr. Musgrove always sits *facing* forward, (and IMO as far as motion sickness is concerned, it's always more comfortable to sit facing the direction your vehicle is travelling in) but then why does Mary add that *she* was sitting in the back seat?\n\nAm I picturing this wrong, or is Mr. Musgrove actually in the habit of taking the *less* comfortable seat, and Mary is just grumbling because she wants a carriage of her own?\n\nOne thing I noticed this time around is that although Mary complains about how much room both her parents-in-law take up, in fact she wasn't sitting next to them at all, but on the other seat beside her sisters-in-law. So, it wouldn't really matter *how* fat or skinny the senior Musgroves were - if there were 5 people in the carriage, Mary's chances of being squashed would still have depended on whether she was sitting next to one other person or two other people (unless there was little leg room as well)!"}

This happens today when loved ones are in the military, or taken seriously ill. How do you visualize her readjustment to her former role after Matthew returned?\n\n11.

{"text":"\u2013in\u2013\nBut Sigrid is not the only one with secrets.\nA high ranking SS officer and his family move down the hall and Sigrid finds herself pulled into their orbit. A young woman doing her duty\u2013year is out of excuses before Sigrid can even ask her any questions. And then there's the blind man selling pencils on the corner, whose eyes Sigrid can feel following her from behind the darkness of his goggles.\nSoon\nIn this page\u2013turning novel, David Gillham explores what happens to ordinary people thrust into extraordinary times, and how the choices they make can be the difference between life and death.\n\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\n\nWhy do you think Sigrid helps Ericha at the cinema in the opening of the book? If you had been in Sigrid's situation, would you have helped Ericha? Would you have become as involved as Sigrid does? With the advantage of hindsight, our perspective is no doubt skewed; since we know the truth behind what was happening in Nazi Germany, how do our answers compare with Sigrid's bold decisions?\n\nAs the story progresses, Sigrid grows more and more involved and takes more and more risks. How does her reasoning for doing so later differ from the reasoning behind her first risky decision in the cinema? What is her motivation for making these increasingly dangerous choices? Desire? Excitement? Conscience?\n\nDiscuss the theme of betrayal in City of Women. Many of the characters are guilty of double\u2013crossing and treachery. In what ways do they deceive one another? What about Egon? Is his betrayal portrayed differently from that of others, such as Renate or Ericha?\n\nSigrid's relationships are numerous and varied\u2014with her mother\u2013in\u2013law, her neighbors, her coworkers, her husband, her lovers, the so\u2013called U\u2013boats. How does each of them define who Sigrid is? How is she reflected in the various relationships? How have these bonds been altered by the extraordinary circumstances of war?\n\nWere you surprised by the depiction of Berlin during World War II? Before reading the novel, had you thought about what life was like on the German home front as the tide turned and defeat loomed on the horizon?\n\nCountless times throughout the novel, characters risk their lives to help others\u2014to protect the value of human life, spurred on by their own integrity. Conversely, there is the scene on the bus where no one does anything as a Jewish woman is arrested and brutalized. Which do you think is typical of human behavior? Are people more inclined to avert their eyes and try to stay out of trouble, or risk their own safety and get involved? Why?\n\nIf one simply observes the facts at surface value, Sigrid would probably not be considered a righteously moral individual. Nonetheless, she manages to be a very sympathetic character. How does the author accomplish this?\n\nSigrid's coworker Renate seems to have a sensibility similar to hers. Yet when Renate discovers that Sigrid's lover may be Jewish, her response shocks Sigrid. Was it naive of Sigrid to expect anything different? Were you surprised by how deep\u2013seated Renate's anti\u2013Semitism was?\n\nOften in the novel, people are not actually who they appear to be. Consider Frau Obersturmf\u00fchrer Junger, the SS officer's pregnant wife who moves in down the hall: were you shocked to find out her secret? Do you feel that everyone in the book is hiding something?\n\nHow would you characterize Sigrid's relationship with Ericha Kohl? Antagonistic? Trusting? Maternal? What do you think Sigrid gets from her relationship with Ericha? What does Ericha get from Sigrid?\n\nWhat did you think about Kaspar? Egon? Wolfram? All are on the wrong side of history. Did you find any of them appealing? Are they very different from one another?\n\nAt one point Sigrid flirts with the idea of turning in Anna Weiss and her two daughters so that she can have Egon to herself. Do you feel she seriously considers this?\n\nHow important is amorous passion in the novel? Is that the driving force that motivates Sigrid? Is it emblematic of something else?"}

{"text":"Reading Guide Questions\n\nThe questions and\ndiscussion topics that follow are designed to enhance your group's discussion of\nJoan Didion's powerful, National Book Award\u2013winning memoir, The Year of\nMagical Thinking. A spare, lucid, and remarkably moving examination of the\nyear following her husband's sudden death just before their fortieth\nanniversary, it is the story of Didion's search for answers, for relief, and\nabove all for the chance to change the course of events. Filled with often\nsurprising insights and more than a dash of humor, it is one of the most\ncritically acclaimed books of the decade.\n\nConsider the four\nsentences in italics that begin chapter one. What did you think when you read\nthem for the first time? What do you think now?\n\nIn particular, address \"The\nquestion of self-pity.\" Does Didion pity herself? In what ways does she indulge\nthat impulse, and in what ways does she deny it?\n\nRead the Judges' Citation for the National Book Award, above. Why do you\nsuppose they deemed the book a masterpiece of investigative journalism?\n\nDiscuss the notion of \"magical thinking.\" Have you ever experienced\nanything like this, after a loss or some other life-changing occurrence? How did\nit help, or hinder, your healing?\n\nDo you think Didion's \"year of magical thinking\" ended after one year, or\ndid it likely continue?\n\nConsider the tone Didion uses throughout the book, one of relatively cool\ndetachment. Clearly she is in mourning, and yet her anguish is quite muted. How\ndid this detached tone affect your reading experience?\n\nHow does Didion use humor? To express her grief, to deflect it, or for\nanother purpose entirely?\n\nOver the course of the book, Didion excerpts a variety of poems. Which\nresonated for you most deeply, and why?\n\nTo Didion, there is a clear distinction between grief and mourning. What\ndifferences do you see between the two?\n\nOne word critics have used again and again in describing this book is\n\"exhilarating.\" Did you find it to be so? Why, or why not?\n\nDiscuss Didion's repetition of sentences like \"For once in your life just\nlet it go\"; \"We call it the widowmaker\"; \"I tell you that I shall not live two\ndays\"; and \"Life changes in the instant.\" What purpose does the repetition\nserve? How did your understanding of her grief change each time you reread one\nof these sentences?\n\nThe lifestyle described in this book is quite different from the way most\npeople live, with glamorous friends, expensive homes, and trips to Hawaii,\nParis, South America, etc., and yet none of that spared Didion from experiencing\nprofound grief. Did her seemingly privileged life color your feelings about the\nbook at all? Did that change after reading it?\n\nAt several points in the book Didion describes her need for knowledge,\nwhether it's from reading medical journals or grilling the doctors at her\ndaughter's bedside. How do you think this helped her to cope?\n\nReread the \"gilded-boy story\" on pages 105\u20136. How would you answer the\nquestions it raised for Didion?\n\nIs there a turning point in this book? If so, where would you place it\nand why?\n\nThe last sentence of the book is \"No eye is on the sparrow but he did\ntell me that.\" What does this mean?\n\nDidion is adapting The Year of Magical Thinking into a play bound\nfor Broadway. How do you imagine its transition from page to stage? Would you\nwant to see the play?\n\nBefore The Year of Magical Thinking, had you ever read any of Joan\nDidion's work?

{"text":"Sunday, December 2, 2007\n\nForster, A Passage to India\n\nWhile reading the section on the \"Caves\" we came up with some interesting ideas and questions for you to think about:\n\nFriendship:\n\nAziz does love Mrs. Moore but not so much Adela \"He had never liked Miss Quested as much as Mrs. Moore, and had little to say to her, less that ever now that she would marry a British official.\"(167)\n\nThis sets a mood of conflict between them and shows Aziz' feelings of restraint due to the her engagement-uncomfortable with the British official that has power over him\n\n\"She was perfect, as always, his dear Mrs. Moore . . . There was nothing he would not do for her. He would die to make her happy.\" (145)\n\n\"Yes, I am your friend\" Mrs. Moore to Aziz (164)\n\nAlthough he does not like Adela as much as Mrs. Moore, Aziz still says:\n\n\"These two had strange effects on him- they were his friend, his for ever, and he theirs forever\u2026\" (157)\n\nEvidence of innocence?\n\nEcho:\n\n\"Life went on as usual, but had no consequences, that is to say, sounds did not echo or thoughts develop.\" (155)\n\nI think this is a really important quote that describes the echo. It's almost as if the echo represents trouble and the future arrest of Aziz. Maybe that's why the echo made Mrs. Moore uncomfortable? That's a bit of a stretch but still can show the impending trouble- \"echoes generate echoes\" (163)\n\nMrs. Moore \"didn't know who touched her, couldn't breathe, and some vile naked thing struck her face and settled on her mouth like a pad . . . For an instant she went mad, hitting and gasping like a fanatic. For not only did the crush and stench alarm her; there was a also a terrifying echo\" (162)\n\n\"There are some exquisite echoes in India . . . The echo in a Marabar cave is not like these, it is entirely devoid of distinction. Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies . . .\" (163)\n\n\"The crush and the smells she could forget, but the echo began in some indescribable way to undermine her hold on life\" (165)\n\nAfter Mrs. Moore leaves the cave she is looking for a villain. Foreshadowing of the incident with Adela?\n\nThe Moguls:\n\nAziz admires Babur but thinks Akbar is foolish because... \"You keep your religion, I mine. That is the best. Nothing embraces the whole of India, nothing, nothing...\"(160) Not even British culture?\n\nAdela counters with \"...I hope you're not right. There will have to be something universal in this country- I don't say religion, for I am not religious, but something, or how else are barriers to be broken down?\"(160) This question seems to show how E.M. Forster is wondering how any humans can connect. Especially in India where there are so many barriers. They then go into a conversation about Adela's impending Anglo-Indian point of view which will further separate her from any sort of universal brotherhood\n\nAziz says he feels like the Emperor Babur, and later says \"But Babur- never in his whole life did he betray a friend\" (159) Foreshadowing his innocence?\n\nAnd then in regards to the problem with Aziz:\n\n\"He was inaccurate because he desired to honor her and- facts being entangled- he had to arrange them in her vicinity, as one tidies the ground after extracting a weed. Before breakfast was over, he had told a good many lies\" (175) Aziz\n\nAziz is digging himself into a hole\n\n\"When an Indian goes bad he goes not only bad, but very queer.\" They keep referring to Aziz in generic terms making them seem to represent the larger conflict between the British and English. Fielding plays an important mediator role between the two races, often siding with Aziz. Interesting? Why is this significant?\n\n\"When evil occurs, it expresses the whole of the universe. Similarly when good occurs\" (197)\n\nWhat did you think of this passage? I thought it was very interesting- saying they were all responsible- he did it, and so did everyone else.\n\n15 comments:\n\nKristina\nsaid...\n\nI don't really think that British culture really embraces the whole of India. I think that it tries to take over the country and it is successful in doing so, but saying that it embraces it is not really true. The natives still have their own religion and ways of doing things and they are often relatively unaffected by the British people in terms of this. They are not treated fairly, however, and the government is controlled by Britain but the Indian culture hasn't been completely taken over. Furthermore, India does eventually get freedom from British control, so England couldn't have overtaken the country so much that it embraced the whole of it.\n\n\"...I hope you're not right. There will have to be something universal in this country- I don't say religion, for I am not religious, but something, or how else are barriers to be broken down?\"(160) I also think that this question is interesting. It does show E.M. Forster's questioning of how humans can connect. I thought that the quote even seemed to foreshadow India's eventual freedom from British rule because she talks about barriers being broken. It seems as though she is suggesting that the people of India should come together on some common ground in order to overthrow the British rule. The quote makes me like Adela a little more than before just because she seems to be standing up for the Indians more than the British by saying it.\n\nI think that the root of the problems that surround the echo in the caves lies in the difference between the echoes that are found in India which are described as \"exquisite\" and the echoes in the cave which are \"entirely devoid of distinction\" (163) and monotonous. Why are the echoes in India not characterized by this deep fear while those in the Marabar caves are? My idea is that the echoes in the caves are so feared because they reduce everything to having the same meaning. It is interesting to note when you look at it this way that only the English people are described as fearing the echoes. As Mrs. Moore says, \"Pathos, piety, courage-they exist, but are identical, and so is filth. Everything exists, nothing has value\" (165). The echoes outside of the caves are exquisite rather than feared because in that realm of India the English are able to apply their hierarchies and social structures in order to develop an India that has meaning for themselves and thus is not feared. Mrs. Moore's anxiety in the caves first develops when she is plunged into darkness and is unable to determine the identities of the people who are touching and crowding her. Her fear arises in this situation because her place in the hierarchy has become unstable- no one can tell that she is English in the dark and she cannot tell who anyone is either. This makes sense to me in my head but I'm not sure I described it well, sorry if it's confusing!\n\nI was thinking pretty much the exact same thing as Megan concerning the echoes of the caves. It reminds me of the deeper unity that is said to underlie the outwardly disparate culture of India (and presumably the world) as evoked in the moment of poetry we looked at toward the beginning of the novel. Looking at it in this sense, it screams 'descending into the unconscious' to me that is somehow like a collective of life and existence or a primordial source. Deep beneath the surface (into the caves) of life, everyone and everything is connected without these social constructions imposed by people. I agree that the novel portrays the English as the only visitors to be startled in the caves, and it seems to portray the Indians in a very 'mystic native' stereotype kind of light, as if there are essential characteristics or connections to the world in \"Orientals.\" On the one hand, Forster is presenting a decently rounded portrait of both English and Indians positive, negative, and neutral characters; yet on the other hand, this particular treatment of the Indians seems a little racist in a way, however well-intentioned it may be.\n\nAnd who would be more likely to read this novel? The audience is almost certain to be English, not Indian, and this is a book that is dealing quite directly with larger social themes as opposed to subtly exploring them. To me it comes off as quite literally the reader's \"passage to India.\" I can imagine English readers picking up the book to get at the \"real India\" that Adela is also looking for. In this sense, maybe Forster is getting carried away with his attribution to the \"Orientals\" of a greater\/easier ability to connect with the world.\n\nThe relationships between Aziz, Mrs. Moore, and Adela are more complex than simply eternal friends. The fact that Aziz befriends the British women in no way proves his innocence or guilt in the accusations against him and his interactions with Adela.\n\nThere is no way that British culture embraces India in any way. The interactions between British settlers and Indian natives at the town party display the incompatability between the cultures. As long as the British remain outsiders and demand control of the natives, the master\/slave complex keeps the cultures from embracing each other as a unified India. Since the cultures are so completely different in practices and values, they can nerver fully assimilate each other. This is not bad, though, as if they were to assimilate, the spiritually rich Indian culture would be lost to a foreign influence.\n\nWhen Forster uses Aziz in conflicts with British authority, it represents the larger Indian population resisting the British occupation of India. The fact that Fielding sides with Aziz shows that, on at least some level, that British authority realizes its presence effecting Indian culture in a negative way and acknoledges that the natives deserve better treatment.\n\nI think the difference between Aziz's feelings towards Mrs. Moore and Adela are purely in Aziz's head. He clearly loves Mrs. Moore more than Adela, but I think these feelings stem from Aziz's initial encounters with the women. He first meets Mrs. Moore in the mosque where she has respectfully followed protocol. I think Aziz is immediately drawn to Mrs. Moore and hopes she will provide the \"oriental\" English figure he's been looking for. In a way, Aziz sees Mrs. Moore in the manner in which he wishes to perceive her. Conversely, he meets Adela in somewhat different circumstances. Adela first appears to Aziz in the whites-club watching an English performance. It is no surprise that Aziz would become more hesitant with Adela after associating her with the white counterparts he finds her with. The fact that Mrs. Moore is found in a mosque and Adela found in a whites-club initially begins the separation that Aziz feels between the two women. Although Aziz eventually cares for both women, I think his first-impressions created the foundation of his relationships.\n\nI think Forster is drawing up a very broad and elaborate extended metaphor with his description of the caves and the \"echo\". I haven't quite wrapped my brain around it yet, but what it seems to me is that Forster is describing varying culutral spheres, \"pockets,\" realms-- what have you.\n\nConsider the following quote: \"Behind it [Kawa Dol (the overarching summit\/rock)], recumbent, were the hills that contained the other caves, isolated each from his neighbour by broad channels of the plain.\"\n\nThese caves are representational of the cultural realms, the Muslim Indian culture, the Anglo-English culture, the Hindu-Indian culture, the infinitesimal sub-divisions of culture that can be divided in a multitude of ways. There are many caves, all similar in shape, indistinguishable from one another. Yet they are not interconnected-they are isolated, some not even penetrated yet, perfect chambers of darkness at the depth of each cave. this is a reference to the small kernel of culture that is appealing and attractive. It is also interesting how the caves are described as being simultaneously magnificent as well as dull.\n\n...\n\n\"Having seen one such cave, having seen two, having seen three, four, fourteen, twenty-four, the visitor returns to Chandrapore uncertain whethre he has had an interesting experience or a dull one or any experience at all.\"\n\nThe caves, representing structures, being penetrated by men with rough tunnels that \"impinge....upon the internal perfection\" are this cultural spheres. Entering these caves is essentially cultural consumption, trying to derive experience\/meaning through exposure to these cultures. However, the process is rough, tainted somewhat, and often bewildering, as it leaves Mrs. Moore and Adela disoriented and disturbed (some kind of culture shock). If left undisturbed, they are perfect dark chambers of perfection, but as soon as the outside world is let in to encounter the depth of the cave things become problematic. Consider the caves that are described as being unfound, no tunnel enters them, they hide within the hills, they are cultures existing in vacuum, cultures not yet subjected to universality to which they will inevitably be bound too.\n\nThe echo comes in here as it is representational of the pursuit of culture, which is the essentially the same endeavour, seeking universal truths through religion, relationship, ritual, etc. All cultures are pursuing the same abstractions, whether they exist or not is unknown. The \"boum\" is both representational of the sameness of these cultural endeavours as it breaks down everything into the same sound, the same reverberation, the same echoing sound. It unites everything in a way but is also unnevering as it undermines certain cultural structures, such as Mrs. Moore's christian identity, and thus becomes very unnerving. It reduces everything to sameness and nothingness (but abscence implying presence, as Godbole would argue).\n\nIts a complicated interpretation but I know Forster is getting at SOMETHING here. I want to talk tomorrow about what he might be trying to draw up with the echo and the caves as two additives to a compounded metaphor.\n\nThere's a lot of great stuff being said about the echoes. I especially like Megan's observation that only the English seem to be affected. England at that time and during the preceding centuries was not a place accustomed to difference. They largely considered France to be their opposite, but on the grand scale, those two countries are more like feuding twins. India, on the other hand, has had a more diverse history, particularly as regards religious life. With the Church of England clearly dominant, the nation was largely preserved from the tumultuous variety of sects in Europe. India not only has many sects, but they teem within two separate religions, Hindu and Islam, which each have very different worldviews. India is a vast mixed plain; England, a sealed-off island. The caves represent a liminal space where religions, cultures, nations, and bodies mix and are so compacted as to almost become one. This is an allegory of imperialism. The Indians are used to a heterogenous culture and are not as unsettled. As for the English, even relatively open-minded individuals like Moore and Quested are used to a more uniform and stable world.\n\n This way of eating is low-fat and high in fiber, thereby reducing high cholesterol, preventing heart disease, reducing cancer risks, assisting with weight management and strengthening the immune system.

{"text":"I Am the Cheese\n\nTAPE OZK012\n\nSummary\n\nAdam tells Brint that he went down to the cellar and waited for his father, even ignoring the phone call from Amy.\n\nA third-person narrator describes how Adam remembers sitting in darkness until his father finds him in the cellar. His father asks him several times if he is all right. Finally, Adam asks him about Grey and Martha. His father sighs with sadness and asks how much he knows. Adam's father has dreaded the day when Adam asked questions about the family's past.\n\nIn a dialogue with Brint, Adam says that his father told him that his real name was Paul Delmonte, and that there was no Adam Farmer. He says his father told him almost everything about their history. They were, indeed, running away that night on the bus. The Delmonte\/Farmer family fled that day in the woods, as well, because his father thought he had seen one of \"them.\" Adam is unsure who \"they\" are now.\n\nIn a third person narrative, Adam remembers back to his conversation in the cellar. His father revealed that his own real name was Anthony Delmonte, and he had been a reporter in the small town of Blount, New York, for the Blount Telegrapher. He was quickly promoted to political reporter, even covering the state capital in Albany. He won a prestigious national award for a series of articles detailing small government corruption in Blount. Anthony Delmonte then married Louise Nolan and they had a son, Paul.\n\nBack in a dialogue with Brint, Adam questions Brint's motives. Brint tells Adam that his motives do not matter and he presses him about the bus ride.\n\nAdam remembers his father telling him he had uncovered important documents at the State House in Albany. Adam tells Brint that the documents linked the corrupt state and federal government to organized crime. His father testified in Washington, D.C. before a closed Senate committee. In return for giving evidence to the investigators, he would be protected and his identity kept secret. For a year, he hid in hotel rooms and visited his guarded house only occasionally while Louise took care of the infant Adam.\n\nAdam says his father did not reveal everything so that Adam would be \"protected against betrayal\" if he were questioned. Brint asks him what he means by betrayal, but Adam is again unsure. Brint believes Adam is withholding knowledge. Adam tells him that his father finally returned to his job in Blount\u2014his editor had given him a leave of absence, thinking he was researching a book. Based on his father's testimony, there were hushed arrests and resignations in Washington. Adam's father was just happy to be back with his family.\n\nA narrator describes how Adam remembers when there was a bomb planted in his father's car. A local policeman had seen two strangers lurking near the Delmonte house, and a phone call warned Adam's father to stay in the house. The police discovered the bomb and a bomb squad defused it. A few days later, Anthony was working late at the newspaper. As he left, the police officer assigned to guard the building pulled a gun on Anthony. Mr. Grey shot the phony guard before the guard shot Anthony. That was the night Mr. Grey became a fixture in the Delmonte's lives.\n\nAdam tells Brint that Grey was one of the first men behind a new government program, the U.S. Department of Re-Identification, and had been attached to Anthony's case from the start.\n\nA third-person narrator describes how Adam remembers talking to his father incessantly once he learned about the Farmer's situation. Adam and his father spoke in a variety of locations\u2014his father explained that the cellar room was cleared for hidden bugs, and that otherwise they should talk in public places or while they are on the move. Adam explains that Grey's department was developed to protect witnesses who testified against powerful organizations, such as the Mafia. Many of these witnesses lived new lives under assumed names. Grey had told his father that his men had foiled the two murder attempts, but that eventually they would get him if he did not join the department. When Louise received a threatening phone call one night, Adam explains that Anthony reluctantly agreed to join.\n\nAdam tells Brint that, because this was in the early days of the protection program, it was not a completely efficient process. The second birth certificate was a mistake, for instance, but Anthony kept it in case they needed it. They were given the name Farmer\u2014which Anthony hated, since it changed their background to Protestant\u2014and the family relocated to Monument. Grey kept them in the Northeast so that they would not stand out, but there was little chance of anyone's tracing them back to Blount.\n\nA third-person narrator describes why there was little chance of the criminal organization tracing the Delmontes. Adam's father showed him a newspaper clipping in the cellar one night. The headline reported that the family had been killed in a car crash.\n\nAdam and Brint end the session.\n\nAnalysis\n\nMany of the previous plot mysteries are explained here, such as why the Rawlings editor did not know the Farmers. Adam's discussions with his father also explain why the emotional world of the Farmers, especially for Adam's mother, has been so dark. Adam's real name, \"Paul,\" could be a reference to \"pall,\" a covering for a coffin. Adam's family has covered the coffins of their former lives, as has Adam in his memory. In the beginning of the novel, Adam also talks about his fear of being confined in small places, like an \"upright coffin.\" Cormier skillfully deploys this information through Adam's direct conversation with Brint and through his memories, so that the reader understands Adam's horrified reaction to first learning about his past, and his fear of re-remembering what he had learned.\n\nJust as Anthony opposed an organization that had more power than he did, so does Adam, it seems, with Brint. Brint manipulates Adam like a puppet with medication and commands him to remember certain pieces of information. Adam begins to suspect openly for the first time that Brint, a somewhat cold figure all along, is trying to squeeze Adam for information that should be irrelevant, an accusation that Brint denies.\n\nInterestingly, the major revelations do not come at end of the book, as in a typical mystery novel, but only two-thirds of the way through the story. Cormier withholds other plot mysteries, such as whom the Delmontes ran away from and how Adam ended up in the institution. More important, Cormier holds back the emotional mystery, such as what will happen on Adam's journey to his father and through his conversations with Brint, and whether he will be able to handle the newfound information about his identity. The main purpose of this mystery, then, is not detective-story conventions about a criminal's identity, but Adam's emotional struggle with his own identity and his discovery of who he really is. The identity realization does not unfold as a typical coming-of-age story, in which the protagonist discovers who he is through experiences of maturation. Instead, Adam learns about his identity in systematic fragments, where the discovery of his identity is not necessarily a good thing."}

{"text":"Underground to Canada: Activity 1\n\nIf you have seen my page Underground to Canada you would know that my class has started inquiry circles, where we\n\nI am loving this book!\n\ngo in groups and read a novel together and have to write notes about the book. My group (Olivia, Alexandra, Jared, Simone and I) is reading the book Underground to Canada by Barbara Smucker with drawings by Imre Holfbauer. My teacher, Mr. Pepper has given us an assignment about what we are reading and disscusing in these groups. The numbered questions below is what we have to write about. Hope you like it!\n\n1. Summarize the main events in your group's novel after 3 days of Inquiry Circles.\n\nJulilly is a 12 or 13 year old slave who has grown up in a fairly mellow Virginia plantation. She has never been whipped or treated badly, until a slave trader from Mississippi came to buy slaves and bring them back to a \"deep south\" plantation. The trader took Julilly away from her family along with many other children and three full grown men. She has to endure starvation, thirst and the blistering heat on the long trip to Misissippi. The \"deep south\" plantation is very different than the one that she grew up in. The slaves were treated like pigs with very little to eat, and if the masters thought that they were not doing their share of work the punishment was being whipped. None of the hundreds of slaves at this plantation were happy with the slave quarters falling apart at the seams, The exhausting heat without shade, everyone is hungry and thirsty twenty-four seven, mean while everyone even the elderly and \"cripples\" have to pick cotton all day long. No one talks at this new place, and the only person who talks to Julilly is her new friend Liza who has suffered too many whippings from Ol' Man Sims.\n\nEverything changes yet again when a large Canadian man named Alexander Ross comes to the Riley plantation to study birds. There is much talk in Julilly and Liza's hut about this mysterious land called Canada, under the north star where once you cross the boundaries you are free from being a slave! Ross then asks Ol' Man Sims for two slaves to guide him. Could Julilly and Liza be the two slaves he chooses? Will Julilly and Liza's dreams of escaping come true?\n\n2. Who are the round and flat characters in your novel? How has the author introduced you to the important characters in your novel? Provide an example of how the author used one (or more) of the above ways to introduce one of the main characters in your novel.\n\nRound Characters: Characters we get to know well. Round characters have a variety of traits that make them believable.\n\nJulilly: A 12 or 13 year old slave, who was taken away from her Mammy (Mother) and sold to a brutal plantation in the \"deep south\". She longs to go back to her Mammy and escape slavery by fleeing to Canada. The only things she can think about are not being whipped, this Alexander Ross fellow and escaping with Liza!\n\nLiza: A \"crippled\" slave that has been slashed with Sims whip a few too many times. She also dreams of escaping but knows first hand the consequences of getting caught. She can't help but think that Ross holds answers for her.\n\nLester: An adult male slave sold at the same time as Julilly. He always has piercing angry eyes, and is proud of Julilly for being so strong. He is also thankful that Julilly helped him during his time of need while they traveled to the Riley plantation. Lester like Julilly was taken away from his family.\n\nFlat Characters: ImportantMammy Sally: Julilly mother who fist told her about Canada before she was sold. A strong, loving and tough woman. She lost her husband the day her only daughter was born.\n\nAdam: An adult male slave sold at the same time as Julilly and was also taken away from his family. His is also set on escaping.\n\nBen: An adult male slave sold at the same time as Julilly and was also taken away from his family. Ben is not sure if he is going to escape or not.\n\nOl' Man Sims: The fat overseer of the slaves, who likes to use his whip very often especially on the elderly and \"crippled\" He reports to Massa (Master) Riley.\n\nMassa Riley: The owner of the plantation, he doesn't keep the slave quarters up to date and doesn't feed his slaves enough.\n\nMassa Henson: The owner of the plantation Julilly grew up on and wasn't very mean to his slaves like Massa Riley is.\n\nAlexander Ross: The new man in the story from the great, cold land called Canada. Ross is an ornithologist at the plantation \"to study birds.\" A few of the slaves hope that he can lead them to Canada.\n\nBarbara Smucker is a great author, she describes her characters by using that characters actions, speech and thoughts, and other characters comments. An example of this is how she described and introduced Liza: \"\u2026sullen, hunchbacked girl\" This immediately makes you think that she has been injured in some. Barbara also has another slave say \"Too many whippin's\" This comment about Liza makes readers think that she has done something to make Sims very angry and whip her quite a lot. A little later in the novel Liza says \"My back is givin me misery\" This now makes me think that the whipping were very very painful especially when the pain has stayed with her for so long. Barbara is great at describing settings, characters, etc. I really like how she writes.\n\n3. Choose an event in the story that you feel is important. Describe what happened. Why do you think the author had this happen at this point in the story? Don't forget to include the characters introduced so far, the setting and any other important information that will allow your blog readers to gain a deeper understanding of the story. If you had been the character involved in this event, how would you have reacted to the event?\n\nThe event that I choose was when Alexander Ross first came to the plantation. This was of course after Julilly was sold and had befriended Liza. Ross came one afternoon while the slaves were picking cotton in the field. When he showed up there was a hush in the field as the work slowed so the slaves could hear what the white folks were saying. Massa Riley was explaining to Sims who and why Alexander Ross was there. Julilly was picking just a few feet away and she could hear every word. When Massa Riley said that Ross was from Canada, Julilly had hope because her Mammy had told her about the foreign place. When they were finished talking Ross went to pick which slaves would help him in his search for birds. Then Sims yelled at the slaves to get back to work and whipped Julilly once, he was about slash at her again but Ross stopped him. I think that Julilly felt grateful, surprised and found herself kind of starting to trust the Canadian. I think that if I were Julilly I would have felt the same way because I would have expected to be whipped more than once by what I had seen earlier. I would also be shocked that a white man had saved me! Especially if the man was from Canada, the place where slaves were free!\n\nI think that Barbara Smucker made this event happen at this point in the book because Julilly and Liza had been talking about Canada the scene before, so it made sense for a Canadian man to come into the story. That would make readers think that he will be the one to help Julilly and Liza get to freedom!\n\n4. Predict what you think is going to happen next in your novel.\n\nI predict that Alexander Ross will pick either one of the girls or both to guide him. I also think that Ross isn't really at the plantation to watch birds because he is so nice to the slaves, I think he will help at least a few slaves be free. I'm not sure if Liza will be able to travel that far because her back but I hope that she can! I also think that Julilly will meet up with her mammy at some point!\n\nThis entry was posted\non Thursday, May 19th, 2011 at 7:25 am and is filed under School.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site."}

{"text":"Reading Group Guide\n\nThis reading group guide forThe Bird House includes an introduction, discussion questions, ideas for enhancing your book club, and a Q&A with author Kelly Simmons. The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEvery family has its secrets. But when you are the last survivor tending to the dark fires of memory, and your own mind is fading, who do you share them with? Your diary or your eight-year-old granddaughter? Or do you simply let them fade away, along with your memory?\n\nThe Bird House is a moving story of secrets, lies, and relationships. It is a close look at the hardship and heartbreak that one woman can withstand during a lifetime. As an elderly woman, Ann Biddle is struggling to both remember and come to terms with the life she has led. It is through her young, but wise granddaughter, Ellie, that Ann finds a way to deal with her past and finally reveal the secrets that have come to taint the present.\n\nTOPICS AND QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\n\n1. Ann reveals within the first chapter that her memory is failing. How did this confession affect your reading? Was Ann an unreliable narrator? Explain your answer.\n\n2. Bird houses are a recurring theme throughout the novel\u2014besides the title itself, Ellie chooses bird houses for her \"Aspect\" school project. Do you think the bird houses hold some sort of symbolism? Why or why not?\n\n3. Throughout the novel, we get bits and pieces of what Ann's husband, Theo, was like. Do you think Ann is fair with his depiction? If the novel had been narrated by Theo, how do you think he would have described himself? How would his perspective differ from Ann's?\n\n4. In the beginning, Ann describes her daughter-in-law, Tinsley, as almost perfect. She even attributes her granddaughter's wonderful demeanor to Tinsley. When do you see Ann's opinion begin to change? Why do you think it changes so drastically? Do you think they will ever completely resolve their differences?\n\n5. Ann thinks the world of Tom and Ellie. In her mind, they can do no wrong. Do you feel the same? Or do you think she is fiercely loyal to them because they are her flesh and blood?\n\n6. Adultery recurs throughout the novel and is also a shared commonality between Ann, her mother, and Tinsley. How do you think this bonds the women together? Does this shared connection help them relate to one another? Or could it also have an opposite effect on their relationships?\n\n7. Ann, her mother, and Tinsley all have completely different personalities and lead completely different lives. What do you think lead each woman to cheat on her partner?\n\n8. There were multiple instances throughout the novel where Ann's daughter, Emma, acts in an odd, and even malicious, manner. Do you think this is a result or an effect of the anger and resentment she feels for losing her daughter at such a young age?\n\n9. Do you blame Ann for her daughter's death? Do you think Ann blames herself? Why do you think she kept this a secret for such a long time?\n\n10. When Ann confronts Tinsley about her affair, she claims to have the best intentions. Do you agree with how Ann handled this discussion? If you were in Ann's position, what would you have done?\n\n11. Ann never gave her father the chance to give his side of the story, and after his death she discovers he was not her biological father. Do you think she should have given him the chance to explain himself? And do you think this was what he was trying to tell her?\n\n12. Ann reveals a great deal about her past, and even present, to Ellie. Do you think this relationship was inappropriate? Why or why not?\n\n13. On page 272, Ann says to Ellie: \"'If you ever have to choose between a man who's serious and a man who's fun, choose the fun one. Promise me.'\" Do you agree with Ann? Who do you think was the \"fun one\" and who was the serious one? Theo or Peter?\n\n14. Did you like that the novel was told from only Ann's perspective? Or would you have a more objective, third person narrator?'\n\nENHANCE YOUR BOOK CLUB\n\n1. Ellie decides to do her school project with the \"Aspect\" of bird houses. Make your own bird house and share it with the group.\n\n2. Ann and Ellie work very hard to create their family tree for Ellie's school project. Visit  or pick up a copy of Shaking the Family Tree: Blue Bloods, Black Sheep, and Other Obsessions of an Accidental Genealogist by Buzzy Jackson, to learn more about how to make a family tree of your own.\n\n3. Not all elderly people have the family and friends that Ann has. Volunteer at a nursing or retirement home with members from your book club. Sit down with someone and ask her to tell you stories of her past.\n\n4. Learn more about Kelly Simmons on her website at  and her blog at \n\nA CONVERSATION WITH KELLY SIMMONS\n\nWhat was your inspiration for The Bird House?\n\nMy daughter brought home an assignment from school that asked her to do a series of projects based on the family history that required interviewing a grandparent. I thought to myself, hmmmm, this assignment could really backfire, couldn't it? With a troubled grandparent, an innocent little girl, and a few family secrets, all hell could break loose! The idea rattled around in the back of my mind for a year or so while I started two other novels. Then I decided it was too powerful a story to ignore and focused my attention on it.\n\nAs your second novel, was the writing process easier or more difficult? What were the differences and similarities in writing The Bird House compared to Standing Still?\n\nIt was a bit easier in the editorial stages because I'd been through the process already. And as with Standing Still, I found the voice of the main character quickly. However, the actual writing was more difficult. The structure of The Bird House, with its twin diaries forty years apart, entwining and untangling, proved challenging. That being said, the most difficult part for me is always choosing material. I guess because of my advertising background, I'm a brainstormer\u2014I generate lots of ideas for novels.\n\nThe main character, Ann, is suffering from early onset of Alzheimer's. Do you personally know anyone suffering from the disease?\n\nYes, our family has struggled with having a loved one diagnosed, as have several of my friends' families. It's a reality for many people, and in the beginning stages, it's so hard to pinpoint and accept.\n\nHow did you research Alzheimer's to make sure Ann's symptoms were realistic?\n\nI interviewed siblings, spouses, and children of Alzheimer's patients, rather than doctors, to hear their stories and to try to get the details right. I wanted the family's perceptions of the symptoms, not the textbook symptoms, if that makes sense.\n\nWhy did you decide to write the novel in the first person? Why did you want readers to get only Ann's perspective?\n\nAnn's perspective works best because her faulty memory makes her an unreliable narrator. I wanted readers to feel the tension and the worry of not knowing what she was going to do or say, or if they could trust her version of events. I love ambiguity and subtlety in a story, and so many novels with multiple narrators or an omniscient narrator go overboard and reveal more than is necessary. It's kind of a TMI situation for me. And I guess I am somewhat obsessed with first-person unreliable narrators, as Standing Still had one too!\n\nYou are a former creative director with a specialization in marketing to women. The Bird House is primarily about women, told from a woman's perspective. Do you think you will ever write a novel from a man's perspective? Or would you rather stick to what you know best?\n\nWell, I admit I have a righteous feminist streak, almost as if I was born in another era. I just really feel the indignation and the struggle deeply. Writing male characters can be a joy, but overall, there are so many more women's stories I want to explore.\n\nYour first novel, Standing Still, deals with anxiety disorders and abduction, while characters in The Bird House cope with Alzheimer's and the death of a child. Why did you choose to pair these dark subject matters in both your novels?\n\nMy agent once told me that I was \"obsessed with what's hidden.\" I'm also obsessed with the things I'm afraid of\u2014which are fairly numerous! If you combed through the magazine articles and newspapers I read, the movies I see, the TV I watch\u2014you'd see immediately I have a fascination with gritty stuff\u2014crime and police, mysteries. By melding them into my work, I'm shedding some feminine, suburban, maternal light on them.\n\nAnn and Ellie are very close throughout the novel. Were you close to either of your grandmothers?\n\nI was close to both of them\u2014the book is dedicated to them\u2014and have amazing, warm, hilarious memories of them both. Because my mother was ill when I was young, these relationships were especially important to me.\n\nWhat are you currently reading? Who are your favorite authors?\n\nI just finished Little Bee, which was my choice for my mother-and-daughter book group. A few of my favorite authors are Ann Beattie, John Irving, and Lionel Shriver. But I love so many!\n\nAre you working on a third novel? What is next for Kelly Simmons?\n\nYes, I'm polishing up a new novel called The Book Addict. Words to live by!"}

{"text":"The Unfinished Gift Discussion Questions: Dan Walsh\n\n1. Christmas is traditionally a holiday where families celebrate and create fond memories. But for many people like Patrick, it merely highlights the emptiness and brokenness that's existed for years. What has your experience been like? If you can't personally relate to Patrick's story, what do you believe has made a positive difference in your family life?\n\n2. Patrick's father and grandfather haven't spoken to each other since before he was born. Do you have any relatives who haven't spoken to each other for years? What consequences has this rift caused for them or your family? What are the main issues? Do you think they justify the separation? If yes, why; if not, why not?\n\n3. With the introduction of Father O'Malley and Ian Collins' recollection of his last conversation with his son, we become aware that Collins is Catholic and the rift has something to do with his son \"pulling away from the faith.\" Does this seem as serious a thing now as it was in the 1940s? Has anyone in your family changed churches? How has this affected relationships in the family? Has it created any conflicts that have proved difficult to forgive?\n\n4. Why do you think Mrs. Fortini was not intimidated by Ian Collins? Do you know anyone like her?\n\n5. After Ian received the MIA telegram about Shawn, he quickly became convinced that Shawn was actually dead. Have you ever jumped to a conclusion about a big event in your life or believed the worst before you had all the facts, and then it was nowhere near as bad as you'd imagined? What lesson can we learn from times like these?\n\n6. At the end of the section where Ian is reading the letters, he reads one he's never seen from his deceased wife, Ida. She is thanking Patrick's mom for helping her to understand the gospel more clearly. Has this book helped you to understand the gospel more clearly? If so, how?\n\n7. The social worker, Katherine Townsend, came to love Patrick almost like her own child. She was rebuked for getting too emotionally involved. After getting so close, how do you think she'll handle letting go? How do you think you would have handled this situation? In the end, do you think she made the right call?\n\n8. How were you affected by the role Ezra Jeffries played toward the end of the story? Have you witnessed anyone treated in a similar way because of their race or ethnic background? Would you have had the courage to step in like Katherine did? 9. What parts of the book impacted you on an emotional level? If there were more than one, which one affected you the most?\n\n10. This book wasn't a mystery novel, but did anything happen that surprised you?\n\n11. The author has said that he intended the unfinished wooden soldier to be more than just a toy Patrick craved, but to serve as a metaphor that weaves the whole story together from beginning to end.

{"text":"Some of the books I've read!\n\nWhat is the major conflict in your book? Ronnie hasn't talked to her father in three years because her parents got a divorce and he left. Since her and her father used to play the piano together, she refuses to play it. Now she has to spend an entire summer with him, away from her friends and her New York. It also doesn't help that she has gotten caught shoplifting twice.\n\nWhat causes the conflict to occur? What are some of the obstacles that lead to the conflict? Ronnie's dad gets put in the hospital, and she finds out he has cancer and didn't have much time left.\n\nWhat is the most exciting part of the plot? Is this when the conflict is resolved? As the summer progresses, Ronnie meets Will, a volleyball player who happens to be very rich and falls in love with him. She also becomes closer with her father, telling him things she would never think of telling her mom.\n\nHow is the conflict resolved? Is this what you expected? Explain. Ronnie's dad has been trying to write a song but just couldn't seem to get it right. When he gets out of the hospital, he isn't strong enough to work on it, so Ronnie starts to work on it. When she finishes it she plays it for him. By the end of the book, Ronnie matured so much. Instead of thinking that her father constantly played the piano so that she would play again, she realized that her father always played because that was what he loved to do.\n\nDescribe the setting in the book. What visual images do you see in your head? Give examples in the book that lead you to these images.\n\nUse the sensory images: visual, taste, smell, movement, etc. As I read the book, I could visualize the ocean's waves crashing into the tide, the smell of the salt water, and the cool summer breeze. The setting reminded me of the lazy, laid back feeling of summer.\n\nDescribe an important symbol in the book. What is the symbol? Ronnie finds a turtle nest on her 3rd night at her dad's house, and sleeps out by them when a raccoon almost destroyed it. The turtles are an important symbol in the book because it shows that Ronnie isn't as bad as she looks. Also as the turtles get closer and closer to hatching, Ronnie gets more and more mature.\n\nWhat effect do the events in plot have on the characters?\n\nHow do the characters change throughout the book? Ronnie went from being rebellious and hating her dad to getting along with him.\n\nDescribe a questionable action by one of the characters. Do you think they were right or wrong? Why? When her dad hides the piano because Ronnie doesn't want to see it. I think he shouldn't have done that and should have explained why he likes to play the piano, but that wouldn't have made a good book.\n\nCompare and contrast two characters in your book. Blaze and Ronnie's parents are both divorced and they're rebellious. Blaze is more of a push over and does whatever Marcus tells her to, but Ronnie sees right through him.\n\nDescribe an important passage in the book. Why is it important? \"Her mind flashed on a dozen different images: Suddenly she knew why her dad wanted her and Jonah to come to North Carolina. And she understood that her mom had known the truth all along. With so little time left together, he had no desire to argue with her. And his ceaseless work on the window now made perfect sense. She recalled his coughing fit in the church and the times he'd winced in pain. In hindsight, the pieces all fit together. Yet everything was falling apart.\" (321) this is important because it was a big turning point in the book and she finally realized that it really wasn't all about her.\n\nWhat other books or stories could you compare this book to? How are they similar? How are they different? The Last Song is like Dear John and all the other Nickolas Sparks books. They pretty much all have to do with love and loss. The only thing that's different is the characters and the problems they face.\n\nWhere there any words that you did not know the definition? Did you look the word up in the dictionary? If you didn't, how did you determine what the word meant? I don't really remember struggling on any words, but when I do come across a word I don't know, I usually read on to see if I can just figure out the meaning.\n\nWas there a moment in the book when you were surprised, angered, upset, excited or happy? Describe the scene and what evoked this emotion. I was sad when Ronnie and Will found Jonah in the shed trying to finish the stained glass window because he believed that if he finished it his dad would get better.\n\nAre there any parts of the story that are confusing? Why? There really wasn't any part of the story that was confusing to me.\n\nIf you could ask the author one question, what would it be and why?\n\nWould you recommend this book to someone else? Why or why not? Use specific examples from the book to answer this question. Yes because it's a typical coming of age and it's a good to read if you are just in the crying mood. It shows how death makes people grow up faster than they usually would."}

{"text":"The Secret Garden\n\nChapter I\n\nSummary\n\nThe omniscient narrator of The Secret Garden begins by enumerating the many defects of Mary Lennox, the ten-year-old girl who is the novel's protagonist. Mary is ugly, with skin made yellow by constant illness. At the outset of the novel, she is living in India with her parents, who have neither time nor affection for her. Her mother, who had never wanted a child at all, has entrusted Mary to the care of a number of Indian servants, whose only instructions are to keep the unloved child out of her mother's sight. Mrs. Lennox is described as a famously beautiful, elegant woman, who does nothing but attend fashionable parties. Though everyone is acquainted with and admires Mrs. Lennox, nearly no one knows that she has a little girl, so totally is the embarrassingly ugly child kept from public view. As the servants are obliged to give Mary whatever she wants (lest her parents be disturbed by her crying), Mary becomes terribly spoiled, selfish, and dictatorial. She loves no one, and no one cares at all for her.\n\nThis already unhappy state of affairs is made worse when a cholera epidemic breaks out in the Indian village where the Lennoxes are living. The family does not manage to flee in time to escape the epidemic because Mary's mother, in the spirit of thoughtless egotism that is typical of her, has insisted upon staying to attend a dinner party. On the morning that the cholera finally strikes the Lennox bungalow, Mary's Ayah (the Indian woman who serves as her nanny) does not come to tend to her. Left utterly unsupervised, Mary wanders into the garden and begins to play by herself beneath a tree. There, she overhears a conversation between her mother and a British officer, after which the events of the morning are explained to her. The fact that her Ayah has died of the cholera does not bother Mary at all, as she did not love her nanny or anyone else.\n\nThe household is seized by terror and confusion, and in the ensuing chaos Mary is completely forgotten. She shuts herself in her room, and does nothing but cry and sleep for more than a day. When she finally ventures out, the house seems eerily deserted, as though it has been abandoned. Mary drinks a glass of wine left standing on the dining-room table. The wine causes her to fall into a deep sleep that lasts many hours. When she awakes, a small green snake with glittering eyes is the only living creature besides Mary herself left in the bungalow\u2014everyone else, including her parents, has died or fled. A party of British soldiers finds her there and takes the newly-orphaned child away with them.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe first chapter of The Secret Garden goes to great lengths to establish Mary Lennox as a \"tyrannical and selfish little pig,\" who is as ugly as she is hateful: she beats her servants, calls them appalling names, and does not mourn her nanny's death. However, the chapter also lays the blame for Mary's flaws at the feet of her parents, particularly her mother. It thereby introduces one of the novel's central themes: the notion that children must be loved if they are to be capable of loving, and given examples of virtue if they are to be virtuous.\n\nThe first chapter also presents Mary as a sickly child. Though the source of her sickness is not entirely clear, the novel subtly attributes it to her childhood in India: \"Her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another.\" India, clearly, is no place for an English child, though the novel suggests that India is at fault, rather than the British invasion of the country.\n\nThe relation between health and location and the relation between well-being and beauty are important motifs throughout The Secret Garden. India is presented as a place which breeds illness and ugliness, as both Mary and her father take ill during their time there; though her mother is beautiful, her beauty conceals a moral illness, or an illness of the soul. Illness and its ostensible causes are pivotal to the novel as a whole.\n\nMary is not loved, for she is an unwanted child whose ugliness is a source of great embarrassment to her mother. Mary is thus positioned as the first of the many secrets which animate the novel: she is herself secreted away from view, and her parents' friends have no idea that they have a child at all. The soldiers who discover her at chapter's end are shocked to find her, and refer to her as \"the child no one ever saw.\" Furthermore, no one takes care of her except the native servants, who do so only because they are commanded to, not because they have affection for her: they forget her entirely when they flee the bungalow.\n\nThe relationship between the servants and the Lennox family is left largely unexplored by the novel, but implies a great deal about British colonialism in India. The servants must obey Mary's every wish, and even must withstand her beatings, because they depend upon her parents for their survival - their disobedience may carry with it the threat of death. This is made painfully clear by the fact that the servants remain with the family, even though they recognize the threat the cholera presents; many of them die because they did not flee earlier.\n\nWhat befalls Mary after the onset of the epidemic has a certain fairy-tale character. The empty dining room with its abandoned meal conjures the tale of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\"; Mary's drinking of the glass of sweet wine recalls Alice in Wonderland, while the oblivious sleep it causes is reminiscent of \"Sleeping Beauty.\" As in a fairy story, Mary awakens from her sleep to find that her world has entirely changed. The motif of sleep recurs as a state in which one \"knows nothing more for a long time\"\u2014that is, as a state of oblivion to be contrasted with the desirable state of wakefulness, which is associated with liveliness and curiosity. The empty house, the tiny snake \"with eyes like jewels\" who serves as her only companion, and Mary's orphaned state itself also seem borrowed from fairy-tales. Fairy-tales and their promises will also recur later in the novel, though they are left implicit here."}

{"text":"Beaufort Book Club\n\nTuesday, May 14, 2013\n\nDiscussion Questions\n1. Does this book have\na central theme? What is it?\n\n2. Why does Mary Anne always read a book's\nending first? How does this reflect her character?\n\n3. Early in the book,\nWill writes, \"I wanted to learn more about my mother's life and the choices\nshe'd made, so I often steered the conversation there. She had an agenda of her\nown, as she almost always did. It took me some time, and some help, to figure it\nout.\" (page 6) What was Mary Anne's agenda?\n\n4. Mary Anne underlined a\npassage in Seventy Verses on Emptiness, which resonated with Will:\n\"Permanent is not; impermanent is not; a self is not; not a self [is not]; clean\nis not; not clean is not; happy is not; suffering is not.\" Why did this strike\nboth of them as significant? What do you think it means?\n\n5. Throughout\nthe book, Will talks about books as symbols and sources of hope. How has reading\nbooks served a similar function for you?\n\n6. While reading A Thousand\nSplendid Suns, Will and Mary Anne discuss three kinds of fateful choices:\n\"the ones characters make knowing that they can never be undone; the ones they\nmake thinking they can but learn they can't; and the ones they make thinking\nthey can't and only later come to understand, when it's too late, when 'nothing\ncan be undone,' that they could have.\" (page 41) What kind of choices did Mary\nAnne make during her cancer treatment? Did she or Will make any of the third\ntype?\n\n7. Mary Anne especially liked a passage from Gilead by\nMarilynne Robinson: \"When you encounter another person, when you have dealings\nwith anyone at all, it is as if a question is being put to you. So you must\nthink, What is the Lord asking of me in this moment, in this situation?\" (page\n96) Why do you think this moved her so much? What did it mean to Will?\n\n8.\nHow does religious belief help Mary Anne? How do you think it might have helped\nWill?\n\n9. Mary Anne doesn't believe her travels to war-torn countries were\nbrave: \"I wanted to go to all those places, so how could that be brave? The\npeople I'm talking about, they did things they didn't want to do because they\nfelt they had to, or because they thought it was the right thing to do.\" (page\n167) In what ways is Mary Anne brave during her cancer treatments? Does she ever\ncome to think of herself as brave?\n\n10. Will is amazed by his mother's\nability to continue her efforts to fund the library in Afghanistan even while\nfacing a death sentence, until he realizes that \"she used her emotions to\nmotivate her and help her concentrate. The emphasis for her was always on doing\nwhat needed to be done. I had to learn this lesson while she was still there to\nteach me.\" (page 194) Did Will learn? What makes you think so?\n\n11. Why\ndid Mary Anne become so intent on certain things happening: Obama's election,\nDavid Rohde's safe return? Will talks about his own \"magical thinking\" several\ntimes in the book\u2014what form do you think Mary Anne's took?\n\n12. \"We're all\nin the end-of-our-life book club, whether we acknowledge it or not; each book we\nread may well be the last, each conversation the final one.\" (page 281) How did\nthis realization affect Will's final days with his mom?\n\n13. After she\ndies, Will looks at Mary Anne's copy of Daily Strength for Daily Needs,\nnext to the bed. He believes this quote from John Ruskin was the last thing his\nmother ever read: \"If you do not wish for His kingdom, don't pray for it. But if\nyou do, you must do more than pray for it; you must work for it.\" (page 321) How\ndid Mary Anne work for it throughout her life? Do you think Will found solace in\nthis passage?\n\n14. Several times in the book, Will talks about eBooks\nversus their physical counterparts. Why does he prefer one to the other? Does\nMary Anne agree? If you read this book on an eReader, how do you think it\naffected your experience?\n\n15. Which of the books discussed by Will and\nMary Anne have you read? Which do you most want to read?\n(Questions issued by publisher.)\n\nMonday, February 18, 2013\n\n1.

One of the opening scenes in A Grown-Up Kind of Pretty depicts Tyler Baines chopping down the Slocumb willow tree. What does this tree symbolize for Big? For Liza? For Mosey?\n2. On page 70, Mosey realizes she isn't who she thought she was. At first, she feels liberated. Then she feels confused and lost. How is she like Liza and Big? What makes her different? Do you think a child takes on traits like compassion, humor, and good sense from her biological parents, or do you think that she learns these from the people who raise her?\n3. Several men in this novel cheat on their spouses (Coach, Lawrence), but the women cheat on one another in a different way. What kind of emotional betrayals show up in their friendships, and in their families? Who do you think is the most loyal person in this story?\n4. Though Liza and Melissa were inseparable when they were young, Big believes that Noveen was a better friend to Liza than Melissa ever was. Patti turns out to be a wonderful friend to Mosey. What have the Duckins women given to Liza and Mosey? How was Melissa different?\n5. One theme in A Grown-Up Kind of Pretty is belonging. On page 224, Big says, \"Bogo wasn't the only stray that Mosey had adopted for us all recently.\" Who do you think are the \"strays\" in this story? When do they find a home?\n6. When Mosey enters Liza's tree house and sees her old Moomin books covered in Magic Marker, she says, \"If I had doubted for a second this place was Liza's, I didn't doubt it now\" (p. 245). Have you ever found a secret place or a secret box that belonged to someone you love? What part of this person did you find there?\n7. Was Big smart to keep the details of her family crisis from Lawrence? If she had shared more with him, do you think he could have helped her, or protected Mosey?\n8. Did Liza do the right thing by taking Mosey from her mother when she was small? Would you still feel that way if Mosey had been a Duckins or a Richardson instead? Why?\n9. Big and Liza are determined to keep Mosey from getting too close to boys. Do you think they're overreacting? What would you do to keep your daughter from making the same mistakes you made?\n10. When something bad happens, Big, Liza, and Mosey often respond with action\u2014though sometimes their approaches aren't quite ethical. Does Liza break Lawrence's ex-wife's plates on purpose, or was it an accident? Did you enjoy it a little, since Sandy cheated on Lawrence and lashed out at Big? Do you think Claire Richardson was at all justified in her attacks on Liza? On Big? Do you blame her less because she lost both her daughters? Though it was wrong of Big to throw bricks at the church's windows, do you think it was justified, given how she was treated by the church community? How does knowing the pain each character has been through change the way you respond to her actions?\nQuestions from litlovers.com\n\nWednesday, August 15, 2012\n\n1. Kamila studied to become a teacher and even earned a prestigious teaching certificate. Before she could complete her training, the Taliban took over Kabul and banned women from nearly all public places, including schools. How did Kamila adapt the skills she learned as a teacher and put them to use starting her dressmaking business, and later in her U.N. work?\n\n2. At many crucial junctures, Kamila turns to her faith for guidance. What role does faith play in her personal journey?\n\n3. Under the Taliban, Afghan women were confined to their homes and saw their lives transformed virtually overnight. Many women like Kamila still needed to support their families, though, and so found creative ways to work within and around these new restrictions. What would you have done under similar circumstances? Would you have dared to go against the Taliban's rules at the risk of your own safety?\n\n4. Malekheh plays an instrumental role in teaching Kamila how to sew and in get ting her dressmaking business off the ground. Kamila often seeks out the advice of her eldest sister, even though she doesn't always take it. How would you characterize the relationship between these two sisters? What role do you think this relationship played in Kamila's business success?\n\n5. Lemmon paints a colorful, yet nuanced portrait of modern day Afghanistan. The story of Kamila and her family presents an alternative to the conventional image of women as victims of war. Did Lemmon's portrayal change the way you think about Afghanistan? Or about women and war?\n\n6. Within a year, Kamila was able to transform a living room operation into a thriving dressmaking business --- selling finely embroidered dresses to tailors throughout Kabul and providing meaningful work for an entire community of women. What do you think about Kamila's business practices? Why do you think she and her sisters were so successful? What lessons about entrepreneurship can be taken from their story?\n\n7. In chapter 7, Kamila and her sisters work around the clock to make 6 dresses for a wedding party, only to discover that the bride is marrying a Talib. How does this episode impact or cause you to revisit your view of the Taliban? If Taliban soldiers knew about the Sidiqi sisters' tailoring business, why didn't they shut it down? What did you think when you saw that there were Taliban who sent their daughters to work with Kamila?\n\n8. How does Lemmon portray men throughout the book? Think of Rahim, Mr. Sidiqi, Ali and his brothers, and the Talibs Kamila encounters. Do these characters reshape or reinforce your impressions of men in Afghanistan?\n\n9. Despite being faced with the daily perils of war and economic hardships, the Sidiqi family never completely abandoned their home in Khair Khana. What does that say about their commitment to their community? To their country?\n\n10. How does Kamila's story affect the way you see the future of Afghanistan and America's presence in this war-scarred country?\n\nMonday, June 04, 2012\n\nDiscussion Questions for Still Alice by Lisa Genova\n1. When Alice becomes disoriented in Harvard Square, a place she's visited daily for twenty-five years, why doesn't she tell John? Is she too afraid to face a possible illness, worried about his possible reaction, or some other reason?\n2. After first learning she has Alzheimer's disease, \"the sound of her name penetrated her every cell and seemed to scatter her molecules beyond the boundaries of her own skin. She watched herself from the far corner of the room\" (pg. 70). What do you think of Alice's reaction to the diagnosis? Why does she disassociate herself to the extent that she feels she's having an out-of-body experience?\n3. Do you find irony in the fact that Alice, a Harvard professor and researcher, suffers from a disease that causes her brain to atrophy? Why do you think the author, Lisa Genova, chose this profession? How does her past academic success affect Alice's ability, and her family's, to cope with Alzheimer's?\n4. \"He refused to watch her take her medication. He could be mid-sentence, mid-conversation, but if she got out her plastic, days-of-the-week pill container, he left the room\" (pg. 89). Is John's reaction understandable? What might be the significance of him frequently fiddling with his wedding ring when Alice's health is discussed?\n5. When Alice's three children, Anna, Tom and Lydia, find out they can be tested for the genetic mutation that causes Alzheimer's, only Lydia decides she doesn't want to know. Why does she decline? Would you want to know if you had the gene?\n6. Why is her mother's butterfly necklace so important to Alice? Is it only because she misses her mother? Does Alice feel a connection to butterflies beyond the necklace?\n7. Alice decides she wants to spend her remaining time with her family and her books. Considering her devotion and passion for her work, why doesn't her research make the list of priorities? Does Alice most identify herself as a mother, wife, or scholar?\n8. Were you surprised at Alice's plan to overdose on sleeping pills once her disease progressed to an advanced stage? Is this decision in character? Why does she make this difficult choice? If they found out, would her family approve?\n9. As the symptoms worsen, Alice begins to feel like she's living in one of Lydia's plays: \"(Interior of Doctor's Office. The neurologist left the room. The husband spun his ring. The woman hoped for a cure.)\" (pg. 141). Is this thought process a sign of the disease, or does pretending it's not happening to her make it easier for Alice to deal with reality?\n10. Do Alice's relationships with her children differ? Why does she read Lydia's diary? And does Lydia decide to attend college only to honor her mother?\n11. Alice's mother and sister died when she was only a freshman in college, and yet Alice has to keep reminding herself they're not about to walk through the door. As the symptoms worsen, why does Alice think more about her mother and sister? Is it because her older memories are more accessible, is she thinking of happier times, or is she worried about her own mortality?\n12. Alice and the members of her support group, Mary, Cathy, and Dan, all discuss how their reputations suffered prior to their diagnoses because people thought they were being difficult or possibly had substance abuse problems. Is preserving their legacies one of the biggest obstacles to people suffering from Alzheimer's disease? What examples are there of people still respecting Alice's wishes, and at what times is she ignored?\n13. \"One last sabbatical year together. She wouldn't trade that in for anything. Apparently, he would\" (pg. 223). Why does John decide to keep working? Is it fair for him to seek the job in New York considering Alice probably won't know her whereabouts by the time they move? Is he correct when he tells the children she would not want him to sacrifice his work?\n14. Why does Lisa Genova choose to end the novel with John reading that Amylix, the medicine that Alice was taking, failed to stabilize Alzheimer's patients? Why does this news cause John to cry?\n15. Alice's doctor tells her, \"You may not be the most reliable source of what's been going on\" (pg. 54). Yet, Lisa Genova chose to tell the story from Alice's point of view. As Alice's disease worsens, her perceptions indeed get less reliable. Why would the author choose to stay in Alice's perspective? What do we gain, and what do we lose?\n\nWednesday, May 09, 20122. How do Nicky Eck's crimes against Molly affect the rest of her life?4. Why does Mariah Snow take an immediate dislike to Molly? Is this a clue to what happened in Mariah's past? Do you believe people like or dislike other people because they possess similar qualities (either positive or negative)?6. What do you make of the author's choice to write a majority of the novel in journal entries and letters? How would the novel be different if she had chosen to tell the story using straight prose?9. What do you think happened to Mary White?11. When Simon Black visits Molly in the mountains in February (page 241), Molly doesn't discuss with Agnes what transpired between them. What do you suppose was said?13. Who do you believe killed Jacky (with the first shot in the stomach, not the second shot in his neck)? Why do you suppose BJ helped Molly cover up what really happened to Jacky?15. What are the reasons behind Molly's decision to go back to Agate Hill in the end? How does this illustrate the change in Molly from the beginning of her life to the end of it?\n16. Which character do you relate to the most in the book, and why?\nQuestions from Readinggroupguides.com\n\nTuesday, April 17, 2012\n\n1.

That there is not the difference you think between us and them.\" If, when he returned to Germany, Willie were to reflect on these words of his father, what would he conclude?\n\n6.

How does his decision to go against his basic rules for training horses turn out?\n\n8. How do you feel about the development of the relationship between Carson Fielding and Rebecca Yarborough? Does it cross any boundaries into becoming an improper relationship? Would you say that their relationship justified Magnus' behavior toward his cattle and Carson?\n\n9.

What is Lebensborn? What role does it play in forming who Willie is? How does it affect who his father is?\n\n13. Why does Carson object to selling the ranch? Why does his father Charles want to sell it? What position does Carson's mother Marie take about selling the ranch? Why? Which character do you side with and why?\n\n14. The Work of Wolves explores the role of silence in personal relationships and communities. It also looks at how silence is understood in a community. Find some examples from the story that illustrate these two points. What does Greggy Longwell mean when he says on p. 384, \"This much silence, it ain't as hard to read things, in some ways\"?\n\n15. The first mention of wolves in this book occurs on page 288. The chapter that shares the same name with the title of the book is only one sentence long. Why is the novel called The Work of Wolves?\n\nThursday, March 08, 2012\n\n1.In many ways, Hadley's girlhood in St. Louis was a difficult and repressive experience. How do her early years prepare her to meet and fall in love with Ernest? What does life with Ernest offer her that she hasn't encountered before? What are the risks?\n2.Hadley and Ernest don't get a lot of encouragement from their friends and family when they decided to marry. What seems to draw the two together? What are some of the strengths of their initial attraction and partnership? The challenges?\n3.The Ernest Hemingway we meet in THE PARIS WIFE\u2014through Hadley's eyes\u2014is in many ways different from the ways we imagine him when faced with the largeness of his later persona. What do you see as his character strengths? Can you see what Hadley saw in him?\n4.The Hemingways spontaneously opt for Paris over Rome when the get key advice from Sherwood Anderson. What was life like for them when they first arrived? How did Hadley's initial feelings about Paris differ from Ernest's and why?\n5.Throughout THE PARIS WIFE, Hadley refers to herself as \"Victorian\" as opposed to \"modern.\" What are some of the ways she doesn't feel like she fits into life in bohemian Paris? How does this impact her relationship with Ernest? Her self-esteem? What are some of the ways Hadley's \"old-fashioned\" quality can be seen as a strength and not a weakness?\n6.Hadley and Ernest's marriage survived for many years in Jazz-Age Paris, an environment that had very little patience for monogamy and other traditional values. What in their relationship seems to sustain them? How does their marriage differ from those around them? Pound's and Shakespeare's? Scott and Zelda's?\n7.Most of THE PARIS WIFE is written in Hadley's voice, but a few select passages come to us from Ernest's point of view. What impact does getting Ernest's perspective have on our understanding of their marriage? How does it affect your ability to understand him and his motivations in general?\n8.What was the role of literary spouses in 1920's Paris? How is Hadley challenged and restricted by her gender? Would those restrictions have changed if she had been an artist and not merely a \"wife\"?\n9.At one point, Ezra Pound warns Hadley that it would be a dire mistake to let parenthood change Ernest. Is there a nugget of truth behind his concern? What are some of the ways Ernest is changed by Bumby's birth? What about Hadley? What does motherhood bring to her life, for better or worse?\n10.One of the most wrenching scenes in the book is when Hadley loses a valise containing all of Ernest's work to date. What kind of turning point does this mark for the Hemingway's marriage? Do you think Ernest ever forgives her?\n11.When the couple moves to Toronto to have Bumby, Ernest tries his best to stick it out with a regular \"nine-to-five\" reporter's job, and yet he ultimately finds this impossible. Why is life in Toronto so difficult for Ernest? Why does Hadley agree to go back to Paris earlier than they planned, even though she doesn't know how they'll make it financially? How does she benefit from supporting his decision to make a go at writing only fiction?\n12.Hadley and Ernest had similar upbringings in many ways. What are the parallels, and how do these affect the choices Hadley makes as a wife and mother?\n13.In THE PARIS WIFE, when Ernest receives his contract for In Our Time, Hadley says, \"He would never again be unknown. We would never again be this happy.\" How did fame affect Ernest and his relationship with Hadley?\n14.The Sun Also Rises is drawn from the Hemingways' real-life experiences with bullfighting in Spain.

Is there a way she could have fought harder for her marriage?\n18.In many ways, Hadley is a very different person at the end of the novel than the girl who encounters Ernest by chance at a party. How do you understand her trajectory and transformation? Are there any ways she essentially doesn't change?\n19.When Hemingway's biographer Carlos Baker interviewed Hadley Richardson near the end of her life, he expected her to be bitter, and yet she persisted in describing Ernest as a \"prince.\" How can she have continued to love and admire him after the way he hurt her?\n20.Ernest Hemingway spent the last months of his life tenderly reliving his first marriage in the pages his memoir, A Moveable Feast.

{"text":"What's going on in the rest of the book?\n\nGreat Expectations Chapter One Summary\n\nOur narrator feels it's important to begin his story with a lecture about his name. His first name is Philip, and his last name is Pirrip. Philip Pirrip. When we try to say that name ten times fast, we end up saying \"filapeera.\" Because it is such a challenging name to enunciate, our narrator decided at a young age to call himself, \"Pip\" for short, and we are much obliged to him. This is a 500-page novel, so the shorter the better.\n\nPip is an orphan who lives in the marsh country along the river Thames, twenty miles from the sea to be exact. He lives with his mean sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and with her blacksmith husband, Joe Gargery.\n\nPip's parents died before he was old enough to have memories. So he likes to chill in the cemetery with their gravestones. He thinks each grave marker is indicative of their personalities, and, thus, gets to know more about them.\n\nDum dee dum. We continue to hang out with Pip in the cemetery in the late afternoon, chilling with the family graves when, suddenly, someone jumps out of a hiding place and grabs Pip by the throat. This someone looks like Mr. Clean, but a dirty and beat up Mr. Clean.\n\nThe scary Mr. Clean look-a-like tells Pip to be quiet or else. Then he demands that Pip bring him some wittles (a.k.a. vittles; a.k.a. food) and a file (a sharp metal instrument, not something you save on your computer).

If so, how?\n\nThe Sentry By Wilfred Owen\n\nWe'd found an old Boche dug-out, and he knew, and gave us hell, for shell on frantic shell hammered on top, but never quite burst through. Rain, guttering down in waterfalls of slime kept slush waist-high and rising hour by hour, and choked the steps too thick with clay to climb. What murk of air remained stank old, and sour with fumes of whiz-bangs, and the smell of men who'd lived there years, and left their curse in the den, if not their corpses \u2026\n\nThere we herded from the blast of whiz-bangs, but one found our door at last, \u2013 buffeting eyes and breath, snuffing the candles. And thud! flump! thud! down the steep steps came thumping and sploshing in the flood, deluging muck \u2013 the sentry's body; then his rifle, handles of old Boche bombs, and mud in ruck on ruck. We dredged him up, for killed, until he whined 'O sir, my eyes \u2013 I'm blind \u2013 I'm blind, I'm blind! Coaxing, I held a flame against his lids and said if he could see the least blurred light he was not blind; in time he'd get all right. 'I can't,' he sobbed. Eyeballs, huge-bulged like squids'. Watch my dreams still; but I forgot him there in posting Next for duty, and sending a scout to beg a stretcher somewhere, and flound'ring about to other posts under the shrieking air.\n\nThose other wretches, how they bled and spewed, and one who would have drowned himself for good, \u2013 I try not to remember these things now. Let dread hark back for one word only: how half listening to that sentry's moans and jumps, and the wild chattering of his broken teeth, renewed most horribly whenever crumps pummelled the roof and slogged the air beneath \u2013 through the dense din, I say, we heard him shout 'I see your lights!' But ours had long died out.\n\nSuicide in the Trenches By Siegfried Sassoon\n\nI knew a simple soldier boy Who grinned at life in empty joy, Slept soundly through the lonesome dark, And whistled early with the lark.\n\nInYour Response to this Theme:\n\nImagine you lived in London during the bombings of World War II.

I had a nice life there; I had my own shop where I used to make fur coats.\n\nOut of the 78 people in my family, I am the only one to survive. My parents had 3 boys and 3 girls: My parents were Jacob and Toby; my brothers were Moishe and Baruch, and my sisters were Sarah, Rivka and Leah. They were all killed.\n\nThe deportations started on July 22, 1942. My other 2 sisters and 2 brothers went to Treblinka. After that I never saw anybody from my family again.\n\nAt Majdanek they took our clothes and gave us striped shirts, pants and wooden shoes.\n\nWe had to walk to work barefoot. After a few days some people could not take it anymore, and they fell down in the road. If they could not get up, they were shot where they lay. After work we had to carry the bodies back. If 1,000 went out to work, a 1,000 had to come back.\n\nThe soldier took us to the railroad tracks, he put us on a train and the next morning we left Majdanek. I had been there 9 weeks. We were on this train for two nights and a day with no food or water. In my 9 weeks at Majdanek I had not changed my shirt or washed myself. We were eaten up with lice, and many of us were swollen from hunger.\n\nWhen we got off the train, we saw that we had arrived at Auschwitz. There was a selection and some of us were machine gunned in a field there. They did not take them to the gas chambers.\n\nI was taken to get a number tattooed on my arm. I got Number 128232. The separate numbers add up to 18. In the Hebrew language the letters of the alphabet stand for numbers. The letters which stand for the number eighteen spell out the Hebrew word \"Chai,\" which means life. After I was tattooed, I was given a potato.\n\nAfter I got out of quarantine, I was put to work building railroad tracks. A young guy came up to me and said, \"I know you.\" I asked him, \"Who are you?\" He said his name was Erlich and that he knew me from Majdanek. I asked him what this place was. He said it was the hospital barracks, Block 20. He told me, \"It is very bad here. Dr Mengele comes two times a week to make selections. But this is Tuesday and he will not come again this week. I will let you know what is going to happen.\" I had not eaten since Monday. He gave me bread.\n\nI was working for over a year with the boys at the same job, digging sand. Every day we loaded up a wagon with the sand and pushed it 16 kilometres. Twice a day we carried sand to Birkenau to cover the ashes of the dead from the crematoria.\n\nI saw when the transports came. I saw the people who were going in, who to the right and who to the left. I saw who was going to the gas chambers. I saw the people going to the real showers, and I saw the people going to the gas. In August and September of 1944 I saw them throw living children into the crematorium. They would grab them by an arm and a leg and throw them in.\n\nI left Auschwitz for Gross-Rosen and 9 days later the Russians liberated it. That cost me 5 months!\n\nGross-Rosen was murder. The guards walked around with iron pipes in their hands. We were put in a shed with two thousand men. In the daytime we had to stand up, and at night we slept head to foot. The only food we got was a slice of bread and a cup of coffee at night. I thought I was going to die there.\n\nEarly at 4 a.m. on 1 May, 1945, near Tutzing, we heard heavy traffic on the highway. We pushed to look out of the two little windows of the train. A jeep drove up with two soldiers. One was a short man, an MP. He spoke good German. He asked who we were. We said we were from the concentration camps. Everybody started hollering and crying."}

{"text":"Oliver Twist-Chapter 38-41\n\nThe title of Oliver Twist is deceptively simple. Although it does nothing more than state the protagonist's name, the central mystery of the novel is, in fact, the protagonist's true identity. Oliver's misfortunes have had much to do with the false or mistaken identities others have thrust upon him. Dickens conceals the solution to the mystery of his true identity, leaving just a clue here and there in order to move the plot forward. Various people seek to conceal Oliver's identity for their own personal gain. Oliver's identity is intertwined with Monks's identity, and the connection between the two of them has shrouded both their identities in mystery. Once it becomes clear that Oliver and Monks are brothers, the novel enters its final stage. We begin to have some idea of who Oliver might be, but the story continues since Oliver himself has yet to find out.\n\nThe meeting of Nancy and Rose represents the clash of two very different worlds. Rose has been raised amid love and plenty, and, as a result, her virtue and kindness are almost unreal. On the other hand, Nancy has struggled for survival in the streets, and instead of conventional virtue, her life is full of crime and violence. Yet both were once penniless, nameless orphans. Rose simply had the good luck to be taken in by Mrs. Maylie, who offered her a road of escape from her unfortunate position. Now, Rose offers Nancy a similar road of escape, but it is already too late for Nancy. Their characters can be seen as part of Dickens's argument that the environment in which people are raised and the company that they keep have a greater influence on their quality of character than any inborn traits. Rose and Nancy were born in similar circumstances: only the environment in which each was raised has made them so different.\nNancy's decision to confront Rose with information about Oliver stands in opposition to her earlier decision to drag Oliver back to Fagin. Just as Nancy causes Oliver to become a thief earlier...\n[continues]"}

{"text":"The Scarlet Letter\n\nChapters 3\u20134\n\nSummary\u2014Chapter 3: The Recognition\n\nIn the crowd that surrounds the scaffold, Hester suddenly\nspots her husband, who sent her to America but never fulfilled his\npromise to follow her. Though he is dressed in a strange combination\nof traditional European clothing and Native American dress, she\nis struck by his wise countenance and recognizes his slightly deformed\nshoulders. Hester's husband (whom we will learn, in the next chapters,\nis now calling himself Roger Chillingworth) gestures to Hester that she\nshould not reveal his identity. He then turns to a stranger in the crowd\nand asks about Hester's crime and punishment, explaining that he\nhas been held captive by Native Americans and has just arrived in\nBoston. The stranger tells him that Hester is the wife of a learned\nEnglishman and had been living with him in Amsterdam when\nhe decided to emigrate to America. The learned man sent Hester to\nAmerica first and remained behind to settle his affairs, but he\nnever joined Hester in Boston. Chillingworth remarks that Hester's\nhusband must have been foolish to think he could keep a young wife\nhappy, and he asks the stranger about the identity of the baby's\nfather.\n\nThe stranger tells him that Hester refuses to reveal her\nfellow sinner. As punishment, she has been sentenced to three hours\non the scaffold and a lifetime of wearing the scarlet letter on\nher chest. The narrator then introduces us to the town fathers who\nsit in judgment of Hester: Governor Bellingham, Reverend Wilson,\nand Reverend Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale, a young minister who is renowned\nfor his eloquence, religious fervor, and theological expertise,\nis delegated to demand that Hester reveal the name of her child's\nfather. He tells her that she should not protect the man's identity\nout of pity or tenderness, but when she staunchly refuses he does\nnot press her further. Hester says that her child will seek a heavenly\nfather and will never know an earthly one. Reverend Wilson\nthen steps in and delivers a condemnatory sermon on sin, frequently\nreferring to Hester's scarlet letter, which seems to the crowd to\nglow and burn. Hester bears the sermon patiently, hushing Pearl\nwhen she begins to scream. At the conclusion of the sermon, Hester\nis led back into the prison.\n\nSummary\u2014Chapter 4: The Interview\n\nHester and her husband come face to face for the first\ntime when he is called to her prison cell to provide medical assistance.\nChillingworth has promised the jailer that he can make Hester more\n\"amenable to just authority,\" and he now offers her a cup of medicine. Hester\nknows his true identity\u2014his gaze makes her shudder\u2014and she initially\nrefuses to drink his potion. She thinks that Chillingworth might\nbe poisoning her, but he assures her that he wants her to live so\nthat he can have his revenge. In the candid conversation that follows,\nhe chastises himself for thinking that he, a misshapen bookworm,\ncould keep a beautiful wife like Hester happy. He urges her to reveal\nthe identity of her lover, telling her that he will surely detect\nsigns of sympathy that will lead him to the guilty party. When she\nrefuses to tell her secret, he makes her promise that she will not reveal\nto anyone his own identity either. His demoniacal grin and obvious\ndelight at her current tribulations lead Hester to burst out the\nspeculation that he may be the \"Black Man\"\u2014the Devil in disguise\u2014come\nto lure her into a pact and damn her soul. Chillingworth replies\nthat it is not the well-being of her soul that his presence jeopardizes,\nimplying that he plans to seek out her unknown lover. He clearly\nhas revenge on his mind.\n\nAnalysis\u2014Chapters 3\u20134\n\nThe town has made Hester into a \"living sermon,\" as Chillingworth puts\nit, because she is stripped of her humanity and made to serve the\nneeds of the community. Her punishment is expressed in violent terms.\nReverend Wilson relates an argument he had with Dimmesdale about\nwhether to force Hester to confess in public. Dimmesdale spoke\nof such an action in terms of a rape, arguing that \"it were wronging\nthe very nature of woman to force her to lay open her heart's secrets in\nsuch broad daylight, and in presence of so great a multitude.\"\n\nThe men who sit in judgment of Hester are not only hypocritical but\nalso ignorant. Bellingham, surrounded by the trappings of his office,\nand Wilson, who looks like \"the darkly engraved portraits which\nwe see prefixed to old volumes of sermons,\" both occupy positions\nwhere power is dependent upon self-portrayal and symbols. They know\nlittle of human nature and judge using overarching precepts rather\nthan the specifics of an individual situation as their guides. The\nnarrator tells us that these ignorant men \"had no right\" to \"meddle\nwith a question of human guilt, passion and anguish.\" Dimmesdale,\non the other hand, seems to know something of the human heart. He\nis compassionate toward Hester and is able to convince Bellingham\nand Wilson to spare her any harsher punishment.\n\nAs part of its meditation on the concept of evil, the\ntext begins to elucidate Dimmesdale's character for the reader.\nThe emerging portrait is not altogether positive. Although Dimmesdale\ndisplays compassion and a sense of justice, he also seems spineless\nand somewhat sinister. His efforts to get Hester to reveal her lover's\nidentity involve a set of confusing instructions about following\nher conscience and exposing her lover in order to save his soul.\nThe reader does not know why Dimmesdale declines to speak straightforwardly,\nbut Hester does. When it is later revealed that Dimmesdale is the\nlover she seeks to protect, his speech becomes retrospectively ironic\nand terribly cruel. In this way, The Scarlet Letter comes\nto resemble a detective story: things have meaning only in the context\nof later information. The larger implication of such a structure\nis that lives have meaning only as a whole, and that an individual\nevent (Hester's adultery, for example) must be examined in a framework\nlarger than that allowed by the categorical rules of religion. This\nnotion returns the reader to the book's general theme of whether\nit is ethically right to judge others.\n\nChillingworth, too, begins to come into focus in these\npages. The novel sets up a formal parallel between Dimmesdale and\nChillingworth before the story makes clear the logical connection\nbetween the two characters. In contrast to Wilson's dehumanizing\ncondemnations and to Dimmesdale's mysterious circuitousness, Chillingworth's\nwillingness to take some of the blame for Hester's \"fall\" seems\nalmost noble. He admits that he was not the right husband for Hester\nand that he was remiss in not joining up with her sooner (even though\nhe seems to have been held captive). Yet, he ultimately chooses\nto use his knowledge for vengeance. While he is less hypocritical\nthan the Puritan fathers, who claim to want only the salvation of\ntheir followers, Chillingworth, as the name he takes suggests, is\ndevoid of human warmth. His marriage to Hester\u2014his one attempt at\nhuman contact\u2014has led to disaster, and any compassion he may once\nhave felt has now faded. Bellingham, Wilson, and the rest of the\nPuritan leadership come across as bumbling, ignorant, and silly\nin their pageantry and ritual when compared with the intentionally\nmalevolent Chillingworth, who seeks revenge, destruction, and sin.\nPerhaps most cunningly, he forces Hester to become the\nkeeper of everyone's secrets, thus stripping her of any chance she\nmay have had at redemption or a happy life. Chillingworth's physical\ndeformity mirrors his spiritual deformity. As Hester suggests, he\nis like the \"Black Man,\" because he lures others into sin. By emphasizing\nChillingworth's scholarly training, the text puts a spin on the\nbiblical equation of knowledge with evil: here it is knowledge without compassion\nor human experience that is the greatest evil.\n\nSparkNotes is the best! \"The Scarlet Letter\" has the most confusing Olde English I think I've ever had to muddle through. Thankfully, SparkNotes broke it down for me and explained what's going on when, 'cause you just can't understand with all the beating around the bush!\n\nThis SparkNote was amazingly easy to understand, I just wish that someone would rewrite the book with modern English.

{"text":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\n\nChapters 11\u201313\n\nSummary\u2014Chapter 11: Conscience Racks Tom\n\nThe day after Tom and Huck witness Dr. Robinson's murder,\nsome townspeople discover the doctor's corpse in the graveyard,\nalong with Potter's knife. A crowd gathers in the cemetery, and\nthen Potter himself appears. To Tom, Huck, and especially Potter's\nshock, Injun Joe describes how Potter committed the crime. Consequently,\nthe sheriff arrests Potter for murder.\n\nTom's pangs of conscience over not telling the truth\nabout the murder keep him up at night, but Aunt Polly assumes that just\nhearing about the horrid crime has upset him. Tom begins sneaking\nto the window of Potter's jail cell every few days to bring him\nsmall gifts.\n\nSummary\u2014Chapter 12: The Cat and the Pain-Killer\n\nBecky Thatcher falls ill and stops coming to school. Tom's\ndepression worsens, so much so that Aunt Polly begins to worry about\nhis health. She gives him various ineffective \"treatments,\" which\nculminate in an awful-tasting serum called \"Pain-killer.\" Tom finds\nthis last treatment so intolerable that he feeds it to the cat,\nwhich reacts with extreme hyperactivity. Aunt Polly discovers what\nTom has done, but she begins to realize that \"what was cruelty to\na cat might be cruelty to a boy, too,\" and sends\nhim off to school without punishment. Becky finally returns to school\nthat morning, but she spurns Tom completely.\n\nSummary\u2014Chapter 13: The Pirate Crew Set Sail\n\nFeeling mistreated, Tom resolves to act on his earlier\nimpulse to become a pirate. He meets Joe Harper, who is likewise\ndisaffected because his mother has wrongly accused and punished\nhim for stealing cream. They find Huck Finn, always up for a new\nadventure, and the three agree to slip away to Jackson's Island,\nan uninhabited, forested isle three miles downriver from St. Petersburg.\n\nThat night, the three boys take a raft and pole their\nway to the island, calling out meaningless nautical commands to\none another as they go. At about two in the morning they arrive\non the island, build a fire, and eat some bacon that Joe has stolen\nfor them. For the rest of the night they sit around and discuss\npirate conduct. Eventually, however, they think about the meat they\nstole and reflect on the shamefulness of their petty crime\u2014after\nall, the Bible explicitly forbids stealing. They decide that \"their\npiracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing\"\nand fall asleep.\n\nAnalysis\u2014Chapters 11\u201313\n\nTwain discourages us from feeling sympathy for Injun Joe,\nthe novel's most pronounced villain. We learn that Dr. Robinson\nonce mistreated Injun Joe by chasing him off when he came begging\none night, but Injun Joe's willingness to murder a man as retribution\nfor this relatively minor offense and his decision to pin the crime\non a pathetic drunk who instinctively trusts him confound our ability\nto feel sorry for him.\n\nJoe's status as a \"half-breed\" (he is half \"Injun,\" or\nNative American, and half white) makes him an outsider in the St.\nPetersburg community. The novel contains racist suggestions linking\nInjun Joe's villainy to the presumed contamination of his white\nblood. Joe tells Dr. Robinson, \"The Injun blood ain't in me for\nnothing,\" suggesting that the alien, \"Injun\" part of Joe is what\ninspires his evil. When Injun Joe reappears in disguise later in\nthe novel, he comes dressed as a deaf and mute Spaniard. In a way,\nJoe's choice of disguise is logical, given his dark features, but\nthe outfit also reinforces Injun Joe's foreignness.\n\nAs in Chapter 8, Becky's rejection\nturns Tom to thoughts of piracy. Twain mocks the convention in adult\nromances that unrequited love drives men to desperate acts. Only\nHuck, who joins Joe Harper and Tom as they act on Tom's pirate fantasy,\nadds an authentic outlaw element to the adventure. Huck smokes and\nis something of an outsider in St. Petersburg society. However, whereas\nInjun Joe is completely ostracized by the St. Petersburg community,\nHuck Finn is allowed some mobility within it, as Huck's roles\u2014as\nTom's companion and, later, as the Widow Douglas's adoptee\u2014show.\n\nThe boys' trip to the island and their plans for a pirate\ncareer demonstrate their imaginative energy and their innocence.\nThrough several exchanges, the three reveal that they know very\nlittle about what being a pirate actually entails. The children's\nbooks they have read furnish their entire conception of an outlaw's\nlife. Tom's remarks about pirates that \"they have just a bully time\n\u2026 [they] take ships, and burn them, and get the money and bury it\nin awful places [but] they don't kill the women\u2014they're too noble\"\ndemonstrate the degree to which Tom idealizes these figures. Furthermore,\nthe boys' remorse over the stolen bacon\u2014an actual, and comparatively small,\noffense\u2014shows that they don't see the storybook misdeeds they venerate\nas actual sins or punishable offenses. In their shame at having\nstolen the bacon, they defer to the Ten Commandments and to their\nown consciences, irrationally deciding that such mean behavior is\nunworthy of their idealized image of a pirate. Up to this moment,\nwe have seen Tom maturing mentally, as he dreams up scheme after\nscheme. He has matured through his eye-opening experiences, such\nas his witness of Dr. Robinson's murder, and he has matured emotionally,\nas he falls for and is rejected by Becky Thatcher. Tom's rejection\nof sinful behavior, however, marks the first instance of his moral\nmaturation. We know he has the capacity to memorize and imagine\na whole new world of pirates on the high seas, but now we see that\nhe understands right versus wrong as well.\n\nIf u have a big exam on this novel coming up.......instead of reading all the chapter analysis's,read the overall anylsis, quotes and come up with the most important charcters and write out WHO they really are. Just a helpful idea.......!\n\nAfter chapter 17, all the chapters are one chapter behind. So chapter 19 is under chapter 18 and so on. I am not positive if this goes on through the rest of the chapters but I know that after chapter 17, this does happen. Hope this helps!"}

{"text":"] I am very confused by the Allenham issue. If Mrs. Smith was \"at home\", why would it be more scandalous (sp) for Mairanne to go there then for Willoughby to stay with the Dashwoods. Is it because Marianne has not been introduced to Mrs. Smith, or because Willoughby is visiting?\n\n] I must have missed something here because this entire incident has escaped me. Would someone please help to enlighten me?\n\nThe first time I read this it seemed to me that Elinor was questioning Marianne's visit while Mrs. Smith was there. But on closer reading I think she is saying that she couldn't believe (on hearing about the visit from Mrs. Jennings) that neither Willoughby would have asked her to go nor would Marianne have agreed to go to Allenham with Mrs. Smith there since Marianne was not acquainted with her. Apparently, at the very least, Mrs. Smith would need to have met her first. When Elinor says she would not have gone there while Mrs. Smith was there (since they had never had an introduction) nor with Willoughby alone with no other person in attendance leads me to believe there were two options: Through an acquaintance with Mrs. Smith, she could go alone with Willoughby or without an acquaintance she could go when Mrs. Smith was out if there was a chaperone. When Marianne says they went in the carriage and there wasn't room for another person to go as chaperone, it seems to me she just did it anyway even though Mrs. Smith wasn't there. This is just my opinion so if I am incorrect, I hope someone will let us know. Hope this helps.\n:-)"}

{"text":"The Chocolate War\n\nChapters 29\u201332\n\nSummary\n\nChapter 29\n\nWhen Brian Cochran adds up the totals, he is astounded and cannot wait to tell Brother Leon. For the past few days the chocolates have been selling like hot cakes, and although he does not understand why, he is relieved that he has good news to report. He has heard rumors that The Vigils were behind the sale, and he has noticed The Vigils whispering to people in the hallways, making threats, and taking off after school with boxes of chocolates in their cars. He thinks it eerie that everyone is being credited with the sales, and that the numbers for each person's individual sale tally is climbing whether that person has sold any chocolates or not. Carter approaches Brian with money from the sale. He tells Brian whom to attribute the boxes\u2014he looks at the roster and attributes some of the sales to boys who have not sold many boxes. When Brian posts the tally at the assembly meeting, he receives a round of cheers from his fellow students.\n\nChapter 30\n\nBrother Leon insists on conducting the chocolate roll call, even though most people bring their money and report directly to Brian. Leon congratulates boys for selling their chocolates even though everyone knows they were not responsible for the sales at all. Leon calls on Jerry, and as always, Jerry says no. Then, a student named Harold Darcy raises his hand and asks Brother Leon why it is that Jerry is not selling the chocolates. Harold says that he and everyone else have the right to know, since they have all been selling chocolates since day one. Brother Leon asks Jerry to answer the question. Jerry replies: \"It's a free country,\" but Brother Leon says that answer is not good enough. Jerry then confirms that the sale is indeed voluntary, and that he does not have to sell the chocolates. Harold asks Jerry if he thinks he is better than everyone else, and Jerry says no, but that he still refuses to sell the chocolates. The tension in the room mounts and is finally broken by the bell. When The Goober goes into the assembly hall that afternoon, he is met with applause. Someone announces that he has sold his fifty boxes, and Goober is shocked since really he has sold only twenty-seven boxes. His feeling that something is rotten at the school is confirmed, and he tries not to think about what it means.\n\nChapter 31\n\nAs Jerry leaves school, someone stops him, asking in a menacing voice: \"What's your hurry, kid?\" It is Emile Janza, who banters with Jerry for a few minutes, trying to intimidate him. Jerry looks around, hoping that someone is in view, but no one is. He was dismissed early from football practice because he had not completed a single pass. As he left the field, he noticed the other players looking at each other, laughing and smirking, and he realized that they had purposely missed his passes. Instead of practicing, Janza had been waiting for Jerry.\n\nEventually, Janza says that Jerry \"lives in the closet.\" When Jerry asks what Janza means, Janza says that Jerry \"is a fairy. A queer. Living in the closet, hiding away.\" Jerry gets extremely upset, and Janza goes on a rant about how Jerry is poisoning the school. While they argue, Jerry notices a group of boys coming out from behind bushes and corners, and they descend on him simultaneously. Jerry curls in a ball and takes the beating, eventually throwing up and driving the boys away.\n\nChapter 32\n\nJerry makes it home, painfully and quietly, not wanting anyone to see him. He washes himself, and lays in the dark, wishing his mother were there. His father is at work on the night shift. As Jerry lies in bed, the phone rings. He answers, but again, hears only cackling. Soon, the phone calls change and instead of laughing, the voice on the other end says things like \"come out and play, Jerry.\" Jerry looks out the window and sees figures in the darkness and threatens to call the police. The phone rings through the night, and eventually Jerry's dad takes it off the hook. Jerry decides not to tell his father what is going on as he does not want his dad involved at all.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBrian is slow to realize that the rejuvenation of the sale in Chapter 29 is due to The Vigils. Perhaps he does not want to believe it, and would rather believe that everyone suddenly is more invested in the sale. He finally acknowledges it, however, but is strangely unconcerned. Brian concentrates on the bottom line, perhaps a quality he picked up from Brother Leon. So long as he can report good news, and so long as Brother Leon is happy with the totals, Brian is happy. He plays dumb when Carter approaches him, and attributes boxes of chocolates to boys he knows did not sell them. In a way, Brian is an accomplice in the rottenness of the sale, silently acquiescing to both The Vigils and Brother Leon. He demonstrates the ways in which the path of least resistance is the easiest and safest route, and despite having some moral objection to both Brother Leon and The Vigils' manipulation of the sale, he goes along with it because in so doing, he eliminates any personal risk. Brian is a foil for Jerry, who constantly fights the path of least resistance, and does that which causes serious risk to himself both emotionally and physically.\n\nOnce again, The Vigils' plan is working perfectly. The general student support for Jerry had been picking up and some kids also considered refusing to sell the chocolates. In spite of The Vigils, for a few days, Jerry had become a kind of revolutionary hero. The Vigils had to do something not only to sell the chocolates, but also to turn the popular sentiment against Jerry. Cormier does not describe exactly how The Vigils enacted their plan, and how they sold all the chocolates and made the sale popular, but by this chapter it is clear that whatever they have done is working. Perhaps Cormier is vague about the details because, like the mafia, The Vigils work quietly and do not give away their secrets.\n\nHarold Darcy, an average, fairly anonymous student at the school publicly questions Jerry, demonstrating that popular feeling has swung from support to resentment of Jerry. Jerry's response in class is inadequate, as Brother Leon explicitly tells him, and the dissatisfaction of the other students implicitly tells him. Jerry is even more on his own now, as the other students feel that Jerry's refusal to sell the chocolates is indicative of his belief that he is better than the rest of them.\n\nThe Vigils attack on a physical level as well in Chapter 31. Emile Janza is their front man in the assault against Jerry, probably because Archie has used the picture to make sure Janza is involved. Janza first makes Jerry vulnerable emotionally by calling him a queer. Cormier clues into the fact that as a high school boy, being called a queer can be worse than being called anything else, and that it can strip a boy's confidence. Janza taunts Jerry with this idea, and Jerry responds exactly how Janza wants. Then, when Jerry is emotionally vulnerable a group of boys descend on him, making him physically vulnerable as well. The Vigils attack from all sides and angles, making nearly every aspect of Jerry's life hellish. Physically, Jerry cannot fight back. Despite having been attacked on multiple fronts, Jerry does not appear to be weakening. He also makes the conscious decision to fight alone, and does not tell his father what is going on."}

These reading comprehension worksheet answers are affiliated with the article, so they won't really make much sense by themselves!\n\nReading Comprehension Worksheet 2 Answers\n\n1. Sainte- P\u00e9lagie, Jean Francois' place of imprisonment, used to be a\n\n(C) fencing school\n\nWhy? In line 32, at the end of paragraph five, the reader learns that Jean Francois is imprisoned at Sainte-P\u00e9lagie. Paragraph six begins to describe the living conditions there and in line 40, a room is described, which is filled with all the \"all the old apparatus of a fencing school,\u2014broken masks, rusty foils, leather jackets and gloves with the stuffing half out. It was there that the political prisoners had dinner together\u2026\" So we see that the room, and hence, most likely, the prison, had once been a fencing school.\n\nWhy? The answer lies in paragraph two, when Jean Francois describes where the police found him - in \"ruined houses\" after his mother dies (lines 6 \u2013 7). We can infer that he was living in those ruined houses, working with the brush seller and catgut scraper, and that when the police found him, he was arrested for being homeless, a crime at the time.\n\n3. The sentence on line 20: \"He talked this way openly, cynically, like a man.\" primarily serves to\n\n(D) demonstrate the effect the protagonist's misfortune has had on his young life.\n\nWhy? Here, with a question that may seem to have a few correct answers, it may be useful to get rid of obviously wrong answers, first. Choice A, \"present new information about the protagonist so his actions are better understood,\" is incorrect because there is no new information about him presented \u2013 just previous info expounded upon. Choice B is incorrect because he never argued against reform school. Choice C is wrong because at that point, he didn't show any signs of cunning, and Choice E is incorrect because although there was definite back-story in paragraph two, there is no back-story presented in the sentence itself, and the question relates only to this one line. Hence, choice D must be correct.\n\n4. You could infer that the group Jean Francois joins after his second arrest would most desire to\n\n(E) overthrow the government\n\nWhy? The key to this answer lies in the words \"most desire to.\" What would \"political prisoners\" (line 41) who meet in the leader's room, have violent disputes, welcome a newcomer with the name \"citizen\" and plot governmental offices (as the hunchback does in the last two lines) most want to achieve? Political stature, which can only happen by an overthrow. Choice E.\n\n5. The following are all incidents prior to Jean Francois' initial arrest EXCEPT\n\n(B) Jean Francois commits petty theft\n\nWhy? Jean Francois commits petty theft in line 31, which is his second arrest. Paragraph two contains all of the other choices, which happens before he's arrested for vagabondage, his first run-in with the law."}

{"text":"Rebecca chapters 4-6\n\nI'm finding it hard to get a grip on the novel and the narrator. I'm not sure if it's because of reading it in little chunks or because the feeling in this part was different. There was decidedly less romance in these chapters - Max came across as precoccupied in a moody kind of way compared to mysterious and suave. In the first three chapters the future looked bleak compared to an idyllic past, but that past is looking less happy now after the less than romantic proposal and the persistent sick feeling in the narrator's stomache.\n\nHow old is she anyway? I had 19 in my head and she acts very young all the time, such as when she's picturing her happy life in her postcard house, doesn't understand Mrs Van Hopper's insinuations she's been sleeping with Max and goes running to Max to make it all better.\n\nStrange that someone who so admired her parent's loving relationship would settle for a cold proposal and recognise there was no mention of love.

His parents are well-off people, since they have a flat with many domestics.\n\n5) Because of his job as an ophthalmologist, Amit's father was invited throughout the world so as to teach in hospitals. That caused the family to move a lot and settle in various places in the whole world.\n\n6) Firstly, he was the only student of Indian origins: l. 22 : \"Amit was the only Indian student\", and that was apparently the first time it happened to him. Moreover, he had arrived there for the fourth year, and his classmates already knew one another, so it was not easy for Amit to become integrated: l.25- 26 \"by that time, friendships (\u2026) in place.

In addition, even though he was a brilliant student before, he had to work very hard to have good results in Langford: l.27: \"he'd had to work doggedly to maintain his grades\". Lastly, Amit realised that his classmates were far richer than him and his family: l.29 : \" his parents' wealth was laughable compared to the majority of Langford boys.\n\n7) This sentence shows that, despite the difficulties Amit had to face and the fact that he missed his family very much, as far as his integration is concerned, he tried to do his best to adapt to his new life in Langford.\n\n8) His parents had chosen Amit to study in Langford because it is a good school, with very good results. Indeed, Amit's father tells him about the number of student from Langford who go to the most famous American Universities. Moreover, even if his parents were moving to Dehli, they don't want their son to study in India, and want him to attend a good school.\n\n9) Amit is angry at his parents who sent him to study far away from them. Moreover, he has to make many efforts to get used to his new way of life, and he reproaches them the decision they made to leave him, to some extent we can say that he may feel abandoned."}

{"text":"Some Initial Questions:\n\n1. At least since medieval times, Europeans and then Americans have associated\ncertain vices with particular colors. It remains common, for example, to\nspeak of someone \"turning green with envy\" or \"black with\nrage.\" Yellow was associated with jealousy. Jealousy is frequently\nused as a synonym for envy, but envy is rarely used as a synomyn for jealousy.\nThis is because the first meaning of jealousy involves suspiciousness about\nthe feelings or fidelity of another. Minny is not jealous in this primary\nsense. Instead she is covetous; she envies the possessions of others. So\nthe author had a choice. Minny did not have to turn yellow. She could have\nturned green. Why might the author have chosen yellow as Minny's punishment?\nWho else in the United States in the late 1870s was considered \"yellow\"?\n\n2. It is the parrot who gets to pronounce Minny's fate. Why not her wronged\nsister? or her mother who had warned her this could happen?"}

{"text":"Special Sub-Topic: The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\n\nThe story begins with an unnamed narrator requesting information from an old man about someone named Leonidas W. Smiley. What is the name of this old man with a proclivity for storytelling?\n\nSimon Wheeler. The narrator describes how a friend of the old man (Simon Wheeler) told him to inquire about Leonidas W. Smiley because his friend knew that the old man would talk about Jim Smiley.\n\nInstead of telling the narrator about Leonidas W. Smiley, the old man tells stories about a man named Jim Smiley. What addiction or bad habit do we learn that Jim Smiley has?\n\nBetting. Jim Smiley would bet on everything from a horse race to which bird on a fence would fly away first.\n\nJim Smiley had a \"small bull-pup\" dog that had a very intimidating name. What was this battle-ready dog's name?\n\nAndrew Jackson. The name seems like a great fit for a fighting dog. I'm glad that there are many laws now-a-days preventing betting on animal fighting.\n\nJim Smiley's prized possession was obviously his \"jumping frog\". What famous political name did Smiley bestow on the frog?\n\nDaniel Webster. According to the old man, Dan'l Webster was the best leaping, most modest, and gifted frog in all of Calaveras County.\n\nHow long did Jim Smiley \"educate\" his frog in order to make him a championship jumper?\n\n3 Months. Jim Smiley trained (educated in Twainspeak) his frog for three straight months in his backyard. According to Smiley, \"all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 'most anything\".\n\nA stranger tells Jim Smiley that he'd challenge Smiley's celebrated frog in a jumping contest, but he can not at the moment because he doesn't have a frog. What wager did Smiley make for this proposed contest?\n\n$40. Forty dollars in 1865 is probably equivalent to over $1,000 today. With all that money at stake, Jim Smiley should've either taken Dan'l Webster or the stranger with him while looking for another frog.\n\nAs Jim Smiley is searching for a frog to give to the stranger for the competition, the stranger engages in some foul business. What cheating act does the stranger do before the competition?\n\nHe pours quail-shot into Smiley's frog.. How dishonorable! The stranger is probably the type of character that goes town-to-town scamming people.\n\nThe stranger ends up winning the competition because Jim Smiley's frog is unable able to jump. What does the stranger say as he leaves the competition?\n\nI don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.. The stranger first said this line about Dan'l Webster after Jim Smiley stated that his frog \"can outjump any frog in Calaveras County\". To make the comment again after winning an unfair competition is adding much undue insult.\n\nAfter the stranger is gone, Jim Smiley tries to discern why his talented frog wouldn't jump. How does he discover that his frog has been tampered with?\n\nHe picks the frog up and realizes that he weighs about five pounds.. I suppose that a five pound frog is rather hefty. Smiley's suspicions were confirmed when Dan'l Webster vomited quail-shot several moments later.\n\nAs the old man is about to finish the story of Jim Smiley's jumping frog, he is interrupted by another individual. The narrator attempts to leave the locale, but the old man catches up with him. The story ends with the old man beginning to tell the narrator about what?\n\nA one-eyed cow.. The cow \"didn't have no tail, only a short stump like a bannanner\". Luckily for the narrator, he was able to escape the old man before he could tell a story about the bovine cyclops.\n\nDid you find these entries particularly interesting, or do you have comments \/ corrections to make?

{"text":"CBSE class X English Delhi set 1 2007\n\nJoin Us\n\nQ. 1. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow : (12 marks)\n\nLast June, my elder daughter Sylvie, finished kindergarten at the school near our home in Bethlehem, USA. If my wife, Theresa, and I have our way, Sylvie will graduate from the same school. I am eyeing Sylvie's graduation because I want this to be her only school and Bethlehem to be her hometown. Both goalsfirst one a school, the second a hometown - eluded me. My father was in the army, and I attended numerous schools. Our transient lifestyle offered a grand upbringing, but it came at a cost. Of all those people I befriended on the run, for instance, I've maintained contact with exactly one. I'm generally from everywhere and exactly from nowhere.\n\nI want Sylvie and her two year old sister Linnea, to have that hometown that I missed. It would be a place they know intimately, care about, return to with a thrill. So when Theresa took a teaching post in Bethlehem, we moved from Chicago and decided to settle down here. That was almost six years ago, and the transition was rough. We did not like the paucity of movie houses, usedbook stores and great restaurants. We found instead, cheap shopping malls and cornfields being transformed into faceless suburbs. It was hard to imagine blossoming in such a place. We began to seek out the good things in Bethlehem, of which, we discovered, there are many. In short order we turned up the children's corner of the public library, a number of parks and the folkmusic club that draws top performers to a venue no bigger than our living room.\n\nWhere we found good places, we found good people. Slowly their numbers increased. Soon we discovered we had knit together a circle of dear friends. As our friendship strengthened, so, too did an unspoken belief that we would be here for each other over the long haul. We'd watch each other's children grow up; offer them a hand where we could, support each other through the joys and travails of parenthood.\n\nThere's a yearly party, a joint sale and more potluck dinners than I can count. We've celebrated both of Linnea's birthdays with a bash on our front lawn. On Saturday mornings when many of us converge downtown, the shopkeepers greet me and my children by name, and hand out goodies. To the old-timers here, all this might be unremarkable. But to the vagabond like me, this acceptance is heart-warming, nourishing and ultimately sustaining. So why resist its pull ? Because it's a mistake to take for granted a good community, or to assume we'd be lucky enough to find one somewhere else. In the end, good and lasting community arises from a commitment to it. And there's no more basic commitment than staying put.\n\n1.1 Complete the summary given below. Use only a word to fill in the blanks. (1\u00d75=5)\n\nThe author decided to stay put at Bethlehem as he wanted it to be his (a) _____________________ hometown.

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow : (8 marks)\n\nSet in the declining but still green Western Ghats in the South-West of Karnataka, Coorg is the heart of India's coffee country. Coffee is the world's most heavily traded commodity after crude oil. Coorg boasts a land area four times larger than Hong Kong and seven times the area of Singapore. Most of it is under tree cover because unlike tea plants, the coffee bush requires shade.\n\nIndia is acknowledged as the producer of the finest mild coffees. With their tropical climate, high altitude, abundant rainfall and fertile soil, Coorg and the neighbouring Chickmangalur districts in Karnataka have consistently produced and exported high quality coffee for over 150 years. The coffee output of these two districts accounts for 70 percent of the total coffee produced in the country. Coorg coffee is valued for its blue colour, clean beans and fine liquoring qualities and hence is in demand in the international markets.\n\nIn March and April, the coffee blossom time in Coorg, when blossoms transform into berries, the bushes are cropped. The cherry-red fruit is then pulped; the seeds separated, dried and sent for curing. Coorg or Kodagu is the district which is one of the largest producers of pepper, cardamom and honey in the world.\n\nNot much is known about the early history of Coorg. Recorded history is available only from 1600 A.D. onwards when Kodava Rajas ruled over the region and established their capital at Mercara by constructing a mud-walled fort. The martial Kodavas troubled Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, who ruled the Mysore region in the 18th century, by way of sporadic rebellions. But in 1785, Tipu's large army marched into Kodagu and devastated the kingdom. Fourteen years later, with the help of the British, who defeated Tipu Sultan following the historic siege of Srirangapatana in 1799, Coorg regained independence and under the leadership of Raja Veerarajendra rebuilt the capital. Later in 1834, the British exiled its ruler Chikkaveera Rajendra and assumed administrative charge of the district. The British left India in 1947, leaving behind a legacy of coffee plantations, colonial buildings and well-planned road networks.\n\n2.1 Complete the following : (1\u00d74=4 marks)\n\nThe tea plants are unlike coffee plants as the latter _____________ .\n\nCoorg coffee is internationally acclaimed for its _____________ .\n\nCoorg is famous not only for coffee but also for _____________ .\n\nAfter crude oil, coffee is the _____________ .\n\n2.2 Complete the table given below : (1\u00d74=4 marks)\n\nYear\n\nEvents\n\n(a) _________\n\nRecorded history of Coorg available from\n\n1785 AD\n\n(b) ____________________\n\n(c) ________\n\nCoorg regained independence\n\n1834 AD\n\n(d) ____________________\n\nSECTION - B\n\nWriting (30 marks)\n\nQ. 3.

{"text":"Reading Guide Questions\n\nIn the prologue we see our narrator, David Kim, reminiscing about the recently demolished Peddlers Town. His sister, Sue, joins him at the site for a kind of impromptu commemoration. At the end of the section, David says, \"I sit back, close my eyes, and remember.\" Though we never return to this present-tense present, how does the retrospective frame enrich the novel?\n\nIn Sook to Noona to Susan to Sue. Across the book, each member of the Kim family changes. How does the new culture they have to navigate accelerate their transformations? Who changes the most? The Kims take on American attributes, but don't leave their Korean culture behind entirely. Which changes does the author portray as losses, and which as gains?\n\nAll comedy is observational. Part of the fun of Everything Asian is how bizarre the Kims find their new world, New Jersey, and how they attempt to make sense of it. Where and how does the author take advantage of these opportunities for satire?\n\nThe structure of Everything Asian is unusual. David is our narrator, yet in between his first-person chapters we get third-person tales of not just his family members but also their fellow merchants at Peddlers Town. Who narrates these stories and why?\n\nOften the younger Kims seem to operate in a completely different world than their parents. How does the author use David's first-person narrative to play up the way the two generations approach America?\n\nEarly on, David sees his father as a loser. Could the same tag apply to the other merchants of Peddlers Town? To all the people in the novel? In a land that reveres success, what are the personal consequences of failure?\n\n\"Girls have to be bold,\" In Sook\/Noona\/Sue says. How does she seize the role of American woman, as opposed to her mother? How does her mother break from the traditional Korean roles of wife and mother?\n\nSo often the individual relationships within the Kim family seem irrevocably broken, yet the family perseveres, mysteriously reconstituting its bonds. This may be the greatest accomplishment of the novel. How does the author show the various family members moving from bitterness and anger back to acceptance and love?\n\nGenerally epigraphs come at the beginnings of books. How would Sherwood Anderson's famous line from Winesburg, Ohio function differently if it preceded the novel? How does it apply to the Kims? To the residents of Peddlers Town?\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this discussion guide is reprinted with the permission of St. Martin's Griffin"}

{"text":"Leaning against the mantlepieceWritten by Delories (10\/26\/2006 3:29 a.m.)in consequence of the missive, Willoughby's attitude?, penned by Ann2\n\nAs far as I know, the way people of Elinor & Willoughby's class held themselves, the posture of their bodies, I mean, was much straighter than the way most of us do now. They bowed and curtsied to one another; shaking hands was still quite \"modern\". Although clothes had loosened up a bit in the previous decade or so, women did wear corsets, and the sort of \"stocks\" and collars men wore under theri chins did the same thing: people kept their backs straight, their heads up, didn't lean against the backs of their chairs, etc.\n\nSo for W. to just settle back against the mantlepiece as if for a longer chat is a sign of being extremely relaxed, as if, in our day, someone sat down on the sofa and put their feet up, as it were. That's why the gesture strikes me as so extraordinary; and remember, he does it _as soon as_ he got what he came for, what his vanity demands: Elinor's \"forgiveness\"."}

It falls to Len to adopt Wrecker, a skittish but fearless child, but Len quickly realizes that he can't manage both Meg and Wrecker at the same time.\n\nLen's neighbors, the tiny commune at Bow Farm, agree to take Wrecker in. Melody, the youngest, bonds with Wrecker instantly and dreads the day she might lose him to his birth mother. Ruth, the eldest, shares an impish sense of humor with the unruly boy. Johnny Appleseed teaches Wrecker respect for nature and suspicion of the law. And Willow, who walked away from her own family, finds herself fighting two overwhelming urges: her maternal feelings for Wrecker and her growing attraction to Len. As two milestones approach - Wrecker's eighteenth birthday and the end of Lisa Fay's prison sentence - this slapdash family quickly bonds around Wrecker's mysterious history, and the hopeful possibilities of his future.\n\nFor discussion\n\nCompare the three settings of Wrecker: hippie San Francisco, the women's prison at Chino, and the secluded Mattole Valley. How does each of these settings look and feel in the novel? What does Lisa Fay miss most about San Francisco? Why does the Mattole Valley feel like home to Melody?\n\nDiscuss the circumstances of Meg's illness. What was Meg like before she got sick? What toll does Meg's condition take upon her marriage, and how does Len express his devotion and his doubts?\n\nWhat are Len's first impressions of three-year-old Wrecker? What reservations does Len have about taking Wrecker in? Are his worst fears justified? Why or why not?\n\nEach resident of Bow Farm\u2014Melody, Willow, Ruth, Johnny Appleseed, and Wrecker\u2014has survived a difficult past. How do we learn about their histories? What are they running away from, and how do they reconcile a painful past with a hopeful present?\n\nYoung Wrecker's early days at Bow Farm are full of \"love in overalls, love with a spade in its hand.\" (28) Why is taking care of Wrecker such hard work? What does each of his caretakers contribute, and how do they make this unusual family work?\n\nCompare Melody and Willow, the two founders of Bow Farm. How do their personalities, homes, and parenting styles differ? What are the sources of tension between these two friends, and how do they eventually resolve their differences?\n\nLisa Fay puts off naming her son until he says to her, \"I a wrecker.\" (63) What is the meaning of this unusual name? What are some of Wrecker's destructive tendencies, and how does he fight the urge to \"wreck\" the things and people around him?\n\nLove doesn't come easily in this novel: Arlyn leaves Lisa Fay, Melody and DF Al don't stay together, Len misses the old Meg, and Ruth mourns the death of Elizabeth. What does this theme of difficult romance add to the novel? How do these stories of lost love compare to Len and Willow's romance?\n\nTrace the journey of the photo that Belle snapped on Wrecker's third birthday. How does the photo get passed along, and what does it mean to each person who has it? How does it eventually land in Wrecker's hands?\n\nConsider Lisa Fay's fifteen years in prison. How does she cope with her circumstances, and what memories and emotions threaten her sanity during these long years?\n\nWhen Melody tells Wrecker about his mother, she finally understands that \"her omission could be as gravely harmful as an outright lie.\" (239) Why does Melody keep Wrecker's history from him for so long? What are the consequences of her silence? Was her \"omission\" a mistake? Why or why not?\n\nWhile Wrecker is at his first school dance, Len and Willow finally admit their feelings for each other. Discuss how these two scenes fit together: Wrecker meeting girls and Len and Willow getting closer in a bar. What discoveries do these characters make during this trip to town?\n\nWhy does Willow share her own story as a mother in her good-bye letter to Wrecker? Discuss how Willow's family history leads her to give Wrecker the following advice: \"Listen to me. Don't choose. Melody is your mother. Lisa Fay is your mother, too.\" (259). How does Wrecker respond to Willow's advice?\n\nWrecker spans twenty years, from the boy's birth to his young adulthood. When does time seem to pass slowly in the novel? When does it pass quickly? Which important events mark these years of Wrecker's life? How does Bow Farm and the Mattole Valley change over these two decades?\n\nDiscuss the last scene of the novel, when Wrecker, Ruth, Len, Willow, Melody, and Lisa Fay sit down to dinner together at Bow Farm. How does this dinner make them into a family? Why do you think it is told from Ruth's perspective? How would this scene be different from the point of view of another character?\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this discussion guide is reprinted with the permission of Bloomsbury"}

{"text":"The Twelve Tribes of Hattie Reading Group Guide\n\nThe Great Migration forms the backdrop for The Twelve Tribes of Hattie and was an ongoing inspiration to the author in writing it. What do you know about this historical phenomenon, and what role can you discern it plays in the book?

How do you think this event changes the course of Hattie's life\/the course of the novel?\n\nHattie thinks her mother would have thought the names she chose for her twins\u2014Philadelphia and Jubilee\u2014were \"vulgar,\" \"low and showy.\" But Hattie chose them to \"give her babies names that weren't already chiseled on a headstone in the family plots in Georgia.\" Instead, she wanted to give them names \"of promise and hope, reaching forward names.\" What do you think the author means to convey here?\n\nIn the second chapter (\"Floyd\"), the narrative moves up twenty-three years, to 1948, and focus shifts to Hattie's oldest surviving son.

{"text":"Jaggers playing at?\n\nWhat is Jaggers up to?\n\nFirst, why does he keep Molly the murderess and Estella's birth mother as his housekeeper? Does she do more than keep his house? Does he have feelings for her similar to Pip's feelings for Estella? Or perhaps she is an exhibit, a trophy from his first big case win?\n\nThen there is an odd exchange between Wemmick and the turnkey at Newgate Prison referring to Pip:\n\nTurnkey: 'Is this young gentleman one of the 'prentices or articled ones of your office?'\n\nWemmick: '...Well, supposing Mr Pip is one of them?'\n\nTurnkey: 'Why then, he knows what Mr Jaggers is.'\n\nI wondered whether he was hinting Jaggers was gay; however I did not think homosexuality was acknowledged in nineteenth century British fiction. However, when Mr Jaggers invites Pip and his three associates to dinner, he takes a shine to Bentley Drummle. That made me wonder whether Bentley Drummle was an attractive man, something that Pip could not see. However, at a later meeting after the marriage Jaggers says,\n\n\"So, Pip! Our friend the Spider has played his cards. He has won the pool.'\nIt was as much as I could do to assent.\n\"Hah! He is a promising fellow - in his way - but he may not have it all his own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to be found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her --'\n\nAfter that I wondered whether Jaggers had seen from the first that Estella would marry Drummle. When I discovered on the internet that Drummle had died by the end of the book, I wondered whether there was a second phase to the revenge mission against men and that Jaggers was aware of it. The first phase would be the breaking of hearts that we all knew about. The second phase would be to destroy a man. I wondered how she would do it. Maybe she would drive him to suicide. I found that very depressing because that would mean Estella was a psychopath. However, it did not turn out that way, so maybe Jaggers just approved of the marriage because he did not want Estella to continue her cruelty on any man who was not as unpleasant as Bentley Drummle.\n\nLastly, what type of lawyer is Mr Jaggers? Is he a solicitor or a barrister? It seems like he argues in court, so that would suggest a barrister, but in his other tasks he seems more like a solicitor."}
{"text":"The book begins with a joke and a story, and jokes and stories -- especially from Crane-man -- continue all through the book. What do you think of Crane-man's sense of humor? How do the jokes and stories help him and Tree-ear face the hard realities of their lives?\n\n2.\n\nIn some ways life in Tree-ear's world is very different from ours in the here and now. What are some of these differences? What are some similarities? Can you imagine Tree-ear or Crane-man or the potter Min living in your neighborhood as modern Americans? What would they be like? What about Kang the potter who invents a new way of decorating pottery?\n\n3.\n\nCrane-man says that seeing the fox actually changed his life, causing him to stay under the bridge instead of going on to the temple. \"Between the fox and you,\" Crane-man tells Tree-ear, \"I was destined never to become a monk!\" What does Crane-man mean by \"destined\"? Is destiny mostly a matter of luck or does it come from qualities in the characters themselves?\n\n4.\n\nWere you surprised when Tree-ear, too, had an encounter with a fox? How does the fox affect Tree-ear's \"destiny\"?\n\n5.\n\nWhere does Tree-ear get the courage for his dangerous mission? Is he already brave before the trip or does his courage grow as he goes along?\n\n6.\n\nDo you think the potter Min is an admirable person? Why or why not? Why does he change in his attitude towards Tree-ear?\n\n7.\n\nBecause of his pride as an artist, Min nearly misses his chance to get the royal commission (pp. 87-89). Crane-man's pride makes it hard for him to take meals in trade for work while Tree-ear will be away (101-102). Yet it's partly pride that makes Min a great artist and that makes the lame Crane-man such a strong person. Then there's Tree-ear, a despised orphan who dares to talk to the royal emissary. How does pride work in our lives, according to the author?\n\n8.\n\nAt the beginning of the story Tree-ear tells how he managed to get some rice from a traveling farmer. How does this brief episode prepare us for the rest of the book? What do you get out of Crane-man's idea that \"Scholars read the great words of the world. But you and I must learn to read the world itself\"?"}

Anyway, on a foreboding night, Victor brings the stitched up corpse pieces to life.\n\nVictor is on the brink of the achievement of a lifetime. He has visions of a Nobel Prize in Potentially Evil and Highly Suspect Late-Night Doings. He has created a superior race of people. He is going to win fame and adoration and, oh wait. No! The monster is huge and not exactly aesthetically pleasing.\n\nVictor is roughly thinking, \"uh-oh.\"\n\nBut wait, you say. What's so bad about this monster? Does he club baby seals or throw soda cans in the trash instead of recycling them? Did he hit someone's mother? Nope. Nope. Nope. He's just ugly. That's it.\n\nAnd frankly, who did Victor expect from a pile of corpse parts, Brad Pitt? And isn't beauty supposed to be on the inside? But in this story, beautiful = good, ugly = evil. Got it? Take it up with Shelley. Or societal ideals of the 1800s.\n\nThe monster leans over Victor and smiles at him. Oh, the horror.\n\nBut Victor has just had a nightmare about Elizabeth and his mother's corpses (think foreshadowing), so when he sees the ugly smile, he runs out of his house and spends the night in his courtyard.\n\nThe next morning, Victor goes for a walk. He can't seem to be able to stand being in the same room as someone who is ugly.\n\nIn town, in one of many remarkably convenient coincidences in this book, Victor runs into his dear old buddy Henry near the town inn. Henry has come to study at Ingolstadt. It's the thing to do.\n\nDon't worry \u2013 Henry is attractive. So it's okay for Victor to be friends with him.\n\nVictor immediately falls ill with a fever, and Henry nurses him back to health over a number of months. Illnesses lasted a long time back then because they didn't have things like penicillin or hygiene."}

{"text":"Reading Guide Questions\n\nWhen you first meet Iris, Wendell, and Ambrose in chapter 1, do they seem mad to you? How do they see one another, and how true do you think their first impressions turn out to be? Use examples from the novel to support your opinion.\n\nThroughout Blue Asylum, attempted rescue is a recurring theme: Wendell and the lamb, Iris and the baby, Iris and Ambrose, Dr. Cowell and Iris. Do you think Iris had any influence over whether Ambrose lived or died? What lessons do you think she learned by the end of the story?\n\nDescribe Dr. Cowell's criteria for a \"sane\" wife. Then, compare Dr. Cowell's relationship with his wife, Mary, to what the doctor tells his women patients they should be to their husbands. How well does his own marriage hold up to his proposed ideal? How do these expectations, fairly representative of Americans in the late nineteenth century, influence the behavior of the women in this novel? How did it make you feel to learn some of the circumstances under which women were committed to asylums during this time period?\n\nThe United States found itself grappling with major shifts in the way people were measured toward the end of the nineteenth century: the abolition movement considered whether African slaves were as equally human as their white masters and what role they should play in society; the women's suffrage movement challenged men to see their wives, sisters, and daughters as intellectual equals who deserved a voice in government; the Civil War raised questions of states' rights versus the need for national identity via federal oversight, and pit American against fellow American based on little more than geography. In what ways does Blue Asylum address these issues? Identify the opinions expressed by various characters throughout, and imagine yourself in their shoes. Do you sympathize more strongly with one \"side\" than another? Why or why not?\n\nWhen Iris undergoes the water treatment, she tells Dr. Cowell, \"This is not treatment. This is torture\" (p. 83). He believes she is insane, and yet he can't let go of her accusations. He tells his wife, \"She called it torture! As though I were some kind of monster!\" Why do you think he is so disturbed by Iris's words, even as his wife reminds him that his patients have taken leave of their senses (and by extension, their opinions of his treatment aren't worth his regard)?\n\nOn page 115, Dr. Cowell finds himself feeling that he \"somehow returned to his youth, as though if he had turned to a mirror in mid-rant he'd see a man with a smooth, young face and a black beard with no hint of grey.\" Contrast this moment with his feeling expressed on page 47 that the island was taking his youth: \"Were he not trapped here, with the lunatics and his moody, attention-demanding wife and son, he'd have been able to remain a younger man.\" Do you feel any sympathy for Dr. Cowell? Why or why not?\n\nWendell is obsessed with the memory of his first childhood love, Penelope, a teenage inmate of the island who commits suicide before the opening of Blue Asylum. How does his unrequited love of Penelope affect Wendell's feelings for Iris? What first draws him to her? If his parents had been more involved in his life, do you think Wendell would have felt the same about the two women? Why or why not?\n\nIn what ways does Wendell identify with the inmates at Sanibel? How does he set himself apart from them?\n\nThe relationships in this novel are beautifully and authentically rendered - they are complicated and complex and rarely what they first appear to be. Discuss Dr. Cowell's relationship with his wife and child, and also with the inmates collectively. Do you think the Cowells love each other? Do you think Dr. Cowell loves his work more or less than his family, and why? Use examples from the novel to justify your opinion.\n\nLydia tells Iris that the latter's love for Ambrose means \"God still sees you not as a lunatic but as His child\" (p. 123). Identify the role that religion plays in the novel, including the characters' expressions of faith and religious feeling.\n\nWhen Iris first asks Wendell to help her escape from the island, he hesitates. With what is he struggling? Why does he first refuse to help Iris and Ambrose? Do you think he's right, or is it like Iris says, that he's just like his father? What ultimately changes his mind?\n\nIt's fairly clear early in the novel that Iris was unfairly committed to the asylum, and the social issue of people (women in particular) being sent off to asylums for simply being \"different\" shines through the narrative. But what about other inmates, like the man whose feet are too heavy, or the woman who intensely feels for every living creature? Who does and doesn't belong in the asylum? Where do you think one properly draws the line of madness?\n\nDr. Cowell changes his mind about Iris several times throughout the novel. What prompts him to consider for the first time that Iris might be telling the truth - that she is the victim of her husband's lies and base character? What changes his mind again?\n\nWhen he finally catches up with her, Dr. Cowell kindly tells Iris that she has made Ambrose \"as happy as he could have been\" (p.262). Do you agree or disagree? Was Iris wrong to take Ambrose with her? What elements factored into Ambrose's eventual breakdown during the war? Why do you think his discovery of Seth's true identity sent him over the edge? Do you think he ever could have recovered from his trauma?\n\nThe color blue plays a significant role in the novel. Identify the ways in which the author uses the color to evoke certain moods or meanings. What various meanings does the color have for each character?\n\nThis novel takes a look at the effects of betrayal on multiple levels. Iris and Lydia betray their husbands' and society's expectations of proper, married women. Dr. Cowell betrays his sacred oath to heal and never harm his patients. Wendell betrays his father's trust. And all of these are set against the backdrop of perhaps America's first and worst betrayal - the war in which she turned on herself, where brother fought against brother. Identify each instance of betrayal in the novel and discuss each character's motivations. Do you feel anyone is 100% justified in their actions? Why or why not?\n\nThough the main action of the story takes place in a setting so far removed it may as well be another country, the effects of the Civil War still cast a shadow on almost every aspect of the novel. From the restriction of goods to the posttraumatic stress haunting Ambrose, identify and discuss how the war influences the characters and events of Blue Asylum. Consider how this influence differs or is similar to the effects of war on Americans today.\n\nDiscuss the ending of the novel. Why do you think the author chose to end with Dr. Cowell back at the asylum, waiting for the mad old woman to come in for her appointment, and with the image of the woman dancing on the beach with her imagined husband?

Marks : 20\nRead the passage given below and then answer the questions which follow:\n12 marks\n1. In spite of all the honours that we heaped upon him, Pasteur, as has been said, remained simple of heart. Perhaps the imagery of his boyhood's days, when he limned the familiar scenes of his birthplace, and the longing to be a great artist, never wholly left him. In truth he did become a great artist , though after his sixteenth year he abandoned the brush for ever. Like every artist of worth, he put his whole soul and energy into his work, and it was this very energy that in the end wore him out. For to him, each sufferer was something more than just a case that was to be cured. He looked upon the fight against hydrophobia as a battle, and he was absorbed in his determination to win. The sight of injured children, particularly, moved him to an indescribable extent. He suffered with his patients, and yet he would not deny himself a share in that suffering. His greatest grief was when sheer physical exhaustion made him give up his active work. He retired to the estate at Villeneuve 'Estang, where he and his kennels for the study of rabies, and there he passed his last summer, as his great biographer, Vallery Radot, has said, \"practicing the Gospel virtues.\"\n2. \"He reverenced the faith of his fathers, \"says the same writer, \"and wished without ostentation or mystery to receive its aid during his last period.\"\n3. The attitude of this man to the science he had done so much to perfect can be best summed up in a sentence that he is reputed once to have uttered, concerning the materialism of many of his contemporaries in similar branches of learning to his own: \"The more I contemplate the mysteries of Nature, the more my faith becomes like that of a Breton peasant's wife.\"\n4. But even then in retirement he loved to see his former pupils, and it was then he would reiterate his life principles: \"Work, \" he would ay, \"never cease to work.\" So well had he kept this precept that he began rapidly to sink from exhaustion.\n5. Finally on September 27, 1895, when someone leant over his bed to offer him a cup of milk, he said sadly: \"I cannot, \" and with a look of perfect resignation and peace, seemed to fall asleep. He never again opened his eyes to the cares and sufferings of a world, which he had done so much to relieve and to conquer. He was within three months of his seventy-third birthday.\n6. Thus passed, as simply as a child, the man whom the French people were to vote at a plebiscite as the greatest man that France had ever produced. Napoleon, who has always been considered the idol of France, was placed fifth.\n7. No greater tribute could have been paid to Louis Pasteur, the tanner's son, the scientist, the man of peace, the patient worker for humanity.\n487 words\n\n1.1 Answer the following question:\n\na.Even accolades and honours did not change the simple man that Pasteur was.

The author chose to tell the story from the provocative point of view of an exceedingly charming, egotistical admitted murderer. Do Balram's ambition and charisma make his vision clearer? More vivid? Did he win you over?\n\n2. Why does Balram choose to address the Premier? What motivates him to tell his story? What similarities does he see between himself and the Premier?\n\n3.

Balram variously describes himself as \"a man of action and change,\" \"a thinking man,\" \"an entrepreneur,\" \"a man who sees tomorrow,\" and a \"murderer.\" Is any one of these labels the most fitting, or is he too complex for only one? How would you describe him?\n\n5. Bal6. Discuss7. Compare Ashok and his family's actions after Pinky Madam hits a child to Balram's response when his driver does.

{"text":"Reading Group Guide\n\n1. For readers who come to Motherless Brooklyn with little knowledge of Brooklyn, what devices, beyond straightforward descriptions, does Lethem use to capture its distinctive atmosphere?\n\n2. Lionel's wordplay includes variations on his own name?Liable Guesscog, Final Escrow, Ironic Pissclaim, for example. How does this particular quirk serve to establish Lionel's sense of himself and his place in the world? Is there an internal logic about the variations or are they simply haphazard?\n\n3. The Minna Men are all orphans, first introduced as teenagers. Discuss how each of them carves out an identity for himself and why this is important to them. How do the initial descriptions Lionel provides of Tony [p. 39], Gil [p. 40], and Danny [p. 42-43] foreshadow the relationships among the four as adults? Do their characters change in the course of the novel?\n\n4. Does Minna see himself as more than a boss to the young men? Does he make a conscious effort to turn the group into a family or does the family feeling develop from the needs of the young men themselves? What evidence, if any, is there that Minna's interest in them is emotional as well as practical? In what ways does Minna's relationship with his own mother and older brother influence the way he treats the Minna Men?\n\n5. Why does Lionel say \"it was Minna who brought me the language, Minna and Court Street that let me speak\" [p.37]? What parts do Tony, Gil, and Danny play in helping Lionel accept his Tourette's Syndrome? How do their individual ways of dealing with Lionel differ? Which man's support is the most significant to Lionel both as a teenager and as an adult?\n\n6. In describing Gil's explanation of Minna's kidnapping and murder, Lionel says \"English might have been his fourth or fifth language from the sound of it\" [p. 94]. Why does Lethem include this observation and other examples of mangled language throughout the book? How do they put Lionel's own \"language difficulties\" in perspective?\n\n7. In addition to Lionel's wonderful, often poetic riffs, what other specific language patterns does Lethem employ to bring the various characters to life? For example, how do Lionel's conversation with the homicide detective [pp. 109-111], his initial encounter with Kimmery [p. 135] and his interview with Matricardi and Rockaforte [pp. 176-177] create impressions of these particular people that are independent of Lionel's own perceptions?\n\n8. What role does Julia play in the novel? In what ways is she the stereotypical \"dame\" of other hard-boiled detective novels and films and how is she different? Do you think Julia is right when she says \"No woman would ever want you, Lionel....That's not really true. They might want you....But they'll never be fair to you\" [p. 297]?\n\n9. Is Kimmery also a stock figure in this tradition? How does Kimmery's reaction to Lionel's Tourettic behavior differ from the reactions of the other characters? Does the brief, romantic interlude between Lionel and Kimmery advance the plot and if so, in what ways? How does it affect your understanding of Lionel? Is Kimmery \"fair\" to Lionel?\n\n10. The Zen Buddhist communities in New York and Maine are not at all what they seem. Are the characters who participate in the Buddhist Zendo?Lionel's brother, Gerald, Julia, and Kimmery?influenced by Buddhist teachings? Do the principles of Zen Buddhism (either as expressed in the book by Kimmery or from your knowledge) illuminate some of the themes Lethem explores?\n\n11. Does Lionel in fact become a \"real detective\"? Do his techniques fit your definition of detective work? Kimmery, for example, is skeptical about both his intentions and his working style [p. 255]. Do you think her evaluation is accurate? In other detective books you may have read, are the heroes completely removed from the personal aspects of the cases they investigate? Is the solution to Minna's murder fully satisfying in light of the evidence presented in the rest of the book?\n\n12. At several points in the book, Lethem makes direct reference to the genres that inform Motherless Brooklyn \u2014 both the classic detective novel and \"wiseguy\" novels and movies. For example, Minna teases Gil for saying \"piece,\" rather than \"gun\" [p. 8]; and Lionel asks \"Have you ever felt, in the course of reading a detective novel, a guilty thrill of relief at having a character murdered before he can step on to the page and burden you with his actual existence?\" [p. 119]. In another passage, Lionel compares himself to the standard set in detective literature: \"So many detectives have been knocked out and fallen into such strange, swirling darknesses...and yet I have nothing to contribute to this painful tradition\" [p. 205]. Why does Lethem include these references? Are they simply there for \"comic relief\" or do they serve another purpose?\n\n13. By using Lionel as narrator, Lethem is following a long tradition in detective fiction. In what ways would the impact on the reader be different if a third-person voice told the story? Why do you think he chose to use a narrator with Tourette's Syndrome? Is this purely a literary device, giving him the opportunity to play with language as an author? Do the classic detective heroes \u2014 for example, Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade and Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe \u2014 have quirks comparable to Lionel's?\n\n14. Does the title of the book refer only to the four orphans who make up the Minna Men? In what ways is Brooklyn itself \"motherless\"?\n\n15. The Voice Literary Supplement wrote \"Lethem loves to cross-wire popular genres and watch the sparks fly.\" In addition to the conventions of the hard-boiled detective novel, what other genre does Lethem draw on in Motherless Brooklyn?\n\nManek, November 27, 2010 (view all comments by Manek)\nHoly living f*ck this is a great book! (Can I use the F word, Powell's, if I don't spell it out? A fleeting expletive is not legally obscene-- can't be, b\/c of the First Amendment. Of course, you, Powell's, are entitled to your own policies. In this case, though, consider an exception. B\/c- once again- F*CK!). Finished it around 4 am last night. Jonathan L. is a genius. Which makes the MacArthur grant make sense. It's top notch literary noir with Tourrette's Syndrome. Eat Me! While I'm at it, let me also recommend the audioversion of Lethem's Chronic City. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his work. (Have to say, though, I didn't love Gun, With Occasional Music, which might be a kind of precursor to Motherless Brooklyn). Plot and characters are both fully developed and satisfying. Go buy it, now! Maybe get it for your friend who likes trashy crime fiction-- the one you wish would read something a little more literary. Telling you- this might be the book. Seriously. Your lowbrow friend will thank you.\n\nWas this comment helpful? | Yes | No (1 of 3 readers found this comment helpful)\n\nThe narrator, Lionel Essrog, known as The Human Freakshow, suffers with Tourette's syndrome and though you might not want to know him in real life, he's got to be one of the most brilliant characters ever created. His quirky rants put me off at first, but I found myself being drawn closer to him with each page, and by the end of the book, I had gained a whole new appreciation for Lionel Essrog. He's trying to find the murderer of the only man who gave him anything resembling fatherly care. Lionel's search takes on rather desperate proportions, but therein lies much of this book's beauty. There's nothing to compare it to a true original.\n\nby Fidel\n\n\"Review\"\nby Time,\n\"Finding out whodunit is interesting enough, but it's more fun watching Lethem unravel the mysteries of his Tourettic creation. In this case, it takes one trenchant wordsmith to know another.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby The Denver Post,\n\"With one unique and well-imagined character, Jonathan Lethem has turned a genre on its ear. He doesn't just push the envelope, he gives it a swift kick....A tour de force.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby Nicholas Kulish, Wall Street Journal,\n\"Jonathan Lethem's sixth book, Motherless Brooklyn, superbly balances beautiful writing and an engrossing plot....Motherless Brooklyn succeeds in the end because the author cares about his creations, especially his protagonist, in whom he instills real humanity.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby The Boston Globe,\n\"Who but Jonathan Lethem would attempt a half-satirical cross between a literary novel and a hard-boiled crime story narrated by an amateur detective with Tourette's syndrome?...The dialogue crackles with caustic hilarity....Jonathan Lethem is a verbal performance artisit....Unexpectedly moving.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby Washington Post,\n\"One of the greatest feats of first-person narration in recent Americn fiction.\"\n\n\"Review\"\nby Newsweek,\n\"Philip Marlowe would blush.

How did the Rachael lose her boat?\n\nIT WAS ATTACKED BY MOBY DICK AND THE BOAT WAS LOST AT SEA. THE SHIP HAD HARPOONED MOBY DICK, AND HE WENT SWIMMING SO FAST AWAY THAT NO ONE EVER SAW THE SHIP AGAIN.\n\n2. Why does Ahab ask whether Moby-Dick has been killed?\n\nHE STARTED TO BECOME UNSURE OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL FIND HIM IN THESE WATERS. HE IS WORRIED SOMEONE MIGHT KILL MOBY DICK BEFORE HE GETS TO.\n\n3. Why is the Rachael's captain investing an uncommon amount of time in his search for the lost boat?\n\nTHE CAPTAIN'S SON WAS ON THAT BOAT.\n\n4. How does Pip make Ahab doubt himself and his mission?\n\nAHAB LOVES PIP; HE IS WORRIED PIP MIGHT GET HURT. SEEING PIP'S MADNESS REMINDS HIM THAT HE IS MAD, AND THAT (FOR THE FIRST TIME) MAKES HIM QUESTION WHAT HE IS DOING.\n\n5. What does Ahab's final comment in chapter 129 mean?\n\nAHAB IS WILLING TO DIE FOR HIS MISSION. HE WILL NOT MOVE, EVEN IF THE BOAT SINKS, UNTIL \"THE OYSTERS COME TO JOIN [HIM]\"\n\nChapters 130 and 131\n\n1. Why does the mood onboard the Pequod shift (the crew is now decidedly gloomy and without humor) in chapter 130?\n\nAhab takes control and is clearly losing his mind (he also loses his hat, which is a scary omen). They are getting closer to Moby Dick \u2013 they are nearing the equator (where Moby Dick likes to hang out \u2013 this is also where Ahab had his leg bitten off); they are encountering many ships who have met Moby Dick (and those people have died\/had other bad things happen because of Moby Dick).\n\n2. What makes Ahab decide to begin standing his own shift at the mast head?\n\nHe wants to see Moby Dick (truth) first \u2013 it's HIS quest (and he believes it is his fate). He also doesn't trust the men to actually see the whale or even tell him if they do see the whale.\n\n3. What happens to Ahab's hat and how is this interpreted?\n\nA bird takes the hat (black hawk). They view this as a bad omen.\n\n4. What happened to the Delight when it met with Moby-Dick?\n\nThey were throwing the dead from their boat into the water when the Pequod pulls up next to them. The ship lost one of its boats and five sailors.\n\n5. What is the other captain's opinion of Moby-Dick?\n\nHe says, \"the harpoon is not yet forged\" that can kill him.\n\nChapters 132 and 133\n\n1. In what ways are the things Ahab is saying to Starbuck in their conversation in chapter 132 very different from what we've come to expect from Ahab?\n\nAhab seems to be more kind-hearted than one might think. He seems to regret having left his wife behind for all those years, and he tells Starbuck not to lower a boat to hunt Moby Dick \u2013 he wants Starbuck to live and get to go home to his family.\n\n2. Who is the first to spot Moby-Dick, earning the doubloon? Why is this important?\n\nAhab (even though Tashtego yells out only a moment later); thus, Ahab got what he wanted (to be the first to sight the whale \u2013 he thought that was fated), and he also got to keep the doubloon.\n\n3. Why are Ahab and his crew unable to attack Moby-Dick as he chews on their boat?\n\nHe is very smart, and he gets his body perpendicular to the boat's keel as he bites the boat; this means that his body is protected by the boat.\n\n4. Why do the other boats not attack the whale after Ahab's boat is destroyed?\n\nThe men from Ahab's boat are in the water near Moby Dick and would be in grave danger if the other men were to attack Moby Dick now.\n\n5. How do Ahab and his crew end up escaping being killed by the thrashing whale?\n\nThe Pequod sails up and right into the battle; this makes Moby Dick turn and leave.\n\nChapters 134, 135, and Epilogue\n\n1. How are the whale and its actions described when he is spotted on the second day? Try to contrast his appearance to Ahab's appearance.\n\nThe whale is seen breaching out of the water \"toward heaven;\" he spouts, and it is glittering, sparkling, and glaring \"like a glacier.\" He seems good and pure, while Ahab seems dark and evil. Notice the darkness of Ahab's skin and face and the blackness of his clothing.\n\n2. On the second day, three harpoons are successfully attached to the whale. Why do the crews have to cut the lines?\n\nMoby Dick swims around in a crazy zig-zag until all the lines are so tangled that the men can do nothing but cut them.\n\n3. What does Ahab say is the reason for continuing the pursuit of Moby-Dick?\n\nHe believes it is his fate.\n\n4. How are Fedallah's four prophecies fulfilled?\n\nFedallah dies before Ahab; then, the first hearse is the whale himself dragging Fedallah down, and the second hearse is the American-wood of the Pequod; next, Ahab is killed by the hemp rope around his neck; finally, Ahab is given neither hearse nor coffin \u2013 he died at sea and was drowned.\n\n5. How is Ishmael able to survive the wreck of the Pequod?\n\nHe was thrown far from the fight when Moby Dick rammed into the boat he was in. Then, when it was all over, Ishmael saw Queequeg's coffin and went to float on it. In the end, the Rachel rescued him (they were still looking for the captain's lost son).\n\nNote: There will not be Department Day tomorrow (Friday, May 10th) because we are taking our last grammar\/punctuation test (50 points)\n\nHW: Study!!!\n\nHonors 11\n\nToday in Class:\n\nQuiz (10 Questions) Chapters 102-125 of Moby Dick\n\nDiscussion:\n\nAfter you finish your quiz, find a passage that you find especially significant from chapters 102-125 and think about how to explain why you believe it is so important in just 3-4 sentences.\n\nYou will earn your 10 \"discussion\" points today for posting your passage and your mini-analysis on TitanPad.

{"text":"Resources for students & teachers\n\nThere was something in Joel's voice that told\nDell that his brother had not been forgotten.\n\"And you?\u2014\u00addon't you?\"\nstammered the younger boy.\n\n\"Mr. Quince picked out a cow and calf for me,\"\nreplied Joel, with a loftiness that two years'\nseniority confers on healthy boys. \"I left\nit to him to choose mine. You'd better\npick out a red one. And say, this hospital of\nours is the real thing. It's the only one\nbetween Dodge and Ogalalla. This strange foreman\nwants to take stock in it. I wonder if that was\nwhat he meant by sawing off a little passel of cattle\non Mr. Quince. Now, don't argue or ask\nfoolish questions, but keep your eyes and ears open.\"\n\nFortified anew in courage, Dell accompanied the trail\nboss to meet his herd. It was a short hour's\nride, and on sighting the cattle, then nearing the\ncrossing, they gave rein to their horses and rode for\nthe rear of the long column, where, in the rear-guard\nof the trailing cattle, naturally the sore and tender-footed\nanimals were to be found. The drag men knew them\nto a hoof, were delighted to hear that all cripples\nwere to be dropped, and half a dozen were cut off and\nstarted up the Beaver. \"Nurse them to the\nnearest water,\" said Straw to the drag men,\n\"and then push them up the creek until I overtake\nyou. Here's where we drop our strays and\ncripples. What? No, I'm only endowing\na trail hospital.\"\n\nThe herd numbered thirty-one hundred two-year-old\nsteers. They filled the channel of the Beaver\nfor a mile around the crossing, crowding into the\ndeeper pools, and thrashing up and down the creek in\nslaking their thirst. Dell had never seen so\nmany cattle, almost as uniform in size as that many\nmarbles, and the ease with which a few men handled\nthe herd became a nine-day wonder to the astonished\nboy. And when the word passed around to cut all\nstrays up the creek, the facility with which the men\nculled out the alien down to one class and road brand,\nproved them masters in the craft. It seemed as\neasily done as selecting a knife from among the other\ntrinkets in a boy's pocket.\n\nAfter a change of mounts for the foreman, Dell and\nthe trail boss drifted the strays up the creek.\nThe latter had counted and classed them as cut out\nof the herd, and when thrown together with the cripples,\nthe promised little passel numbered thirty-five cattle,\nnot counting three calves. Straw excused his\nmen, promising to overtake them the next morning,\nand man and boy drifted the nucleus of a future ranch\ntoward the homestead.\n\n\"Barring that white cow and the red one with\nthe speckled calf,\" said Straw to Dell, pointing\nout each, \"you're entitled to pick one\nfor yourself. Now, I'm not going to hurry\nyou in making your choice. Any time before we\nsight the tent and shack, you are to pick one for your\nown dear cow, and stand by your choice, good or bad.\nRemember, it carries my compliments to you, as one\nof the founders of the first hospital on the Texas\nand Montana cattle trail.\""}

If you were Jeremy's friend, what would you have said? Lexie is nervous about meeting Jeremy's family, and though they were referenced quite a bit in both True Believer and At First Sight, they are minor characters, in that the reader never even learns the names of Jeremy's parents. Why did the author do this? Should the characters have been developed further? Why or why not?\n\nThe story largely takes place during the forty week period while Lexie is pregnant, which always changes a relationship. Yet, during this time, Jeremy and Lexie are still getting to know each other. How does the pregnancy affect the development of the relationship? Are the developments more positive or negative? At the same time, Jeremy and Lexie are remodeling a house, and Jeremy struggles with writer's block. It seems, to Jeremy anyway, that when it rains it pours. Describe how these challenges affect Jeremy? How do they affect Lexie?\n\nMayor Gherkin plays a lesser role in this novel than in True Believer. The town, too, plays a lesser role. Doris, Jed, Rachel and Alvin, on the other hand, play more prominent roles in At First Sight. Who was the most important of the minor characters? Who was the least important? Why did the author choose to \"switch\" the prominence of the characters in the sequel?\n\nDescribe the symbolism of the mysterious lights in the cemetery. In what ways does this symbolism portrayed in the relationship between Lexie and Jeremy?\n\nWorking late one night, Jeremy receives an e-mail that calls into question whether the child is actually his. At first he dismisses it; later, however, he begins to wonder how well he really knows Lexie. Should Jeremy have told Lexie about the e-mail right away? Would he have believed her? How might the relationship have played out differently had Jeremy been less secretive? In what ways was Lexie secretive? Who was more at fault when the problems in their relationship began to arise?\n\nAfter Jeremy and Lexie are married, Jeremy takes a walk on the beach, where he spies some wild horses grazing on the dunes. This paragraph is one of the author's favorite passages in the novel. Were there any passages that you found particularly insightful, well-written or interesting?\n\nDoris tells Lexie that a happy marriage means meeting your spouse's needs, while they do the same for you. If your spouse could meet only one of your needs, what would it be? What would your spouse's be? (The Ten Needs, from the book, His Needs, Her Needs, are: Communication, Affection, Honesty, Family commitment, Financial Support, Sex, Recreational companionship, domestic support, physical attractiveness, and admiration)\n\nToward the end of the novel, just as Lexie and Jeremy are settling into life as a married couple, new tension is suddenly added to the relationship. How would you react had this happened in your marriage?\n\nThis is the first of Nicholas's novels in which life after the characters fell in love is described in detail. It's also the first novel in which the characters were in love when the book began. In what other ways was this novel different than the author's previous work? Can this novel still be described as a love story? Why or why not?"}

{"text":"Study Questions & Essay Topics\n\nStudy Questions\n\nAn answer to this question should point out\nthat money is the be-all, end-all symbol to most of the novel's\ncharacters except perhaps Selden. The upper-class society depicted\nin the novel is built on money. Admission to society is based on\nmoney. Social acceptance and, more importantly, power are products\nof money. To Lily, money means the ability to gain a permanent footing\nin society; that is why she always wants more of it. To Selden,\nmoney is the means by which people are destroyed and false, meaningless\nsocietal relationships are formed. To Bertha, money is the means\nby which she can maintain her power and influence over other people\nin society, getting them to believe whatever she wants them to believe.\n\nA good answer would involve a discussion\nof Lily's continual motivation by money. Her basic motivation, the\navoidance of \"dinginess,\" never changes. Her goal is always to marry\na wealthy man and live in the upper ranks of society. Her social\nstature is what really changes in the novel. As she falls lower\ninto the \"chasm\" Wharton describes, her desire to get out becomes\ngreater. Interestingly, this question could also be answered with\na discussion of how Lily will never change her mind on some things,\nincluding her decision to repay Gus Trenor all his money even though\nshe does not have to, and even though it spells her financial ruin.\n\nTo answer this question, look at Lily's indecision.\nShe holds firm to a constant belief that when it comes to marrying,\nshe can always do better than the current situation offers her.\nThis is why she delays in marring Gryce, Rosedale and Selden. Ironically,\nher standards never go up; they only go down as she becomes more\ndesperate. Nevertheless, if Lily were not plagued by her wishy-washy\nnature, she would have gotten married earlier and most likely lived\nhappily ever after. Her desire for more wealth and more fame (as\nalso seen in her perpetual gambling) is what brings her down.\n\nSuggested Essay Topics\n\n1. Is Lily's death inevitable\nand necessary, or could she have recovered and found a way to get\nback into society? In other words, is Lily fated to die?\n\n2. Describe the differences between\nLily's outlook on society and Selden's. What views do they hold\nin common? On what viewpoints do they differ?\n\n3. Many of the married men in\nthis novel lead boring and sad lives. Compare the attitudes and\ncharacterizations of Gus Trenor and George Dorset to those of Lawrence\nSelden and Simon Rosedale. What do they have in common with one another?\nWhat are their differences?\n\n4. How does the novel work with\nbehavioral details? Pick three tiny details that Wharton uses to\ngive the reader a clue as to what a character is thinking. You may\nwant to consider Lily's blushes and smiles in the novel, as well\nas the role of lighting cigarettes in the novel. Or you can look\nat the opening scene, in which Selden plays a mind game with Lily\nto determine by her actions what she is doing.\n\n5. How does this novel compare\nwith another novel of manners you have read (see \"The Novel of Manners\"\nsection)? You may wish to consider the novels of Jane Austen, Henry\nJames of George Eliot.\n\n6. Lily goes through some sweeping\nmood swings in the novel, fluctuating rapidly between happiness\nand despair. Pick two or three scenes in which Lily goes from happy\nto distressed, and analyze how this happens.\n\n7. How does Selden change over\nthe course of the novel? Explore his struggle between his desire\nto stay detached from society and his love for Lily."}
